	abstract = {Although software has helped researchers conduct research, little is known of the impact of software on science. To fill this gap, this article proposes an improved bootstrapping method to extract software entities from full-text papers and assess their impact on science. Evaluation results show that the proposed entity extraction system outperforms three baseline methods on extracting software entities from full-text papers. The proposed method is then used to learn software entities from all papers published in PLoS ONE in 2014. More than 2000 unique software entities are obtained which accounted for more than 20,000 mentions and more than 7000 citations. The paper finds that software is commonly used in the scientific community along with a substantial uncitedness.},

	abstract = {CERMINE is a comprehensive open-source system for extracting structured metadata from scientific articles in a born-digital form. The system is based on a modular workflow, whose loosely coupled architecture allows for individual component evaluation and adjustment, enables effortless improvements and replacements of independent parts of the algorithm and facilitates future architecture expanding. The implementations of most steps are based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, which simplifies the procedure of adapting the system to new document layouts and styles. The evaluation of the extraction workflow carried out with the use of a large dataset showed good performance for most metadata types, with the average F score of 77.5 \%. CERMINE system is available under an open-source licence and can be accessed at http://cermine.ceon.pl. In this paper, we outline the overall workflow architecture and provide details about individual steps implementations. We also thoroughly compare CERMINE to similar solutions, describe evaluation methodology and finally report its results.},
