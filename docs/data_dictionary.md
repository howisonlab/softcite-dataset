# Data Dictionary: Softcite dataset

Raw annotation data repository: https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset

Annotators tagged software mentions by articles. For each article they documented their annotation results in a single RDF file (i.e., each RDF file is an annotator-article level input), named as "annotator_id-article_id.ttl". Each article, annotator, and software mention, have its unique identifier in each RDF file. All the RDF files are locted in `data/individuals-*`.

RDF file schema:
	For each article annotators document
		`codable`: if the article is in English and human-readable
		`standard_type`: if the article is a regular academic article with reference
		`coded_no_in_text_mentions`: if the article does not contain software mentions in its body text

		Each software mention is an `in_text_mention` with the following annotation fields:
			`full_quote`: the text span where the software mention is identified
		`tei_full_quote`: added during post-processing for text aligning purpose. Counterpart of `full_quote` in TEI XML text 		conversion of original PDF articles.
			`on_pdf_page`: location indicator for text aligning consideration
			`spans_pages`: if the software mention goes across the page break
			`mention_type`: software, or other annotator defined categories such as dataset, database, hardware, etc.
				A self-rated `certainty` score is attached within this field, ranging from 1 to 10 (integer)
				A free-text `memo` field is accompanied for documenting annotator reasoning for judgment.
			`software_was_used`: if the software is used in the research discribed in the article
			`software_name`
			`version_number`
			`version_date`
			`url`
			`creator`
			`has_reference`: if the software mention has a reference entry.

		The `reference` linked to `in_text_mention` contains the following annotation fields:
			`full_quote`: the full reference entry corresponding to the software mention in body text.
			`on_pdf_page`
			`spans_pages`
			`reference_type`: select one from 4 options: publication/user_guide/project_page/project_name
			`software_name`
			`version_number`
			`version_date`
			`url`
			`creator`

All the individual RDF input are parsed into a rectangular dataset in CSV format, located in data/csv_dataset.

CSV data schema:
	`softcite_articles.csv`: article,article_set,coder,no_selections_found
	`softcite_codes_applied.csv`: selection,coder,code,was_code_present,code_label
	`softcite_in_text_mentions.csv`: selection,coder,article,quote,tei_quote,page,mention_type,certainty,memo
	`softcite_references.csv`: reference,from_in_text_selection,article,quote,coder,page,reference_type

After expert review, we have an aggregated dataset in TEI XML format, each software mention only has one final adjudicated annotation and is presented in its context paragraph. The TEI XML dataset include article level metadata for identifying annotated academic articles. Each annotated software mention is associated with an `xml:id` as its unique identifier linking to the corresponding article. The annotation of software mention in TEI XML corpus also include annotator id, type(software/version/publisher/url). Note that `version_date` and `version_number` have been merged into `version`; `creator` has changed to `publisher` (just a field title change). All the annotation that has been modified during expert review has a `curator` identifier associated.
