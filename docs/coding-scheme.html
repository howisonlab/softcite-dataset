<tr><td>has_in_text_mention      </td><td>Applies to article. This code is applied to each in text mention of software.
<br />
<br />    Use this code multiple times, once for each mention. Name the mention so that it is the article title followed by an underscore, then your initials, then a number. Start that number at 01 and increment one each time you find a new mention. Doesn't have to match the order the mentions are in the PDF.
<br />
<br />    Do not use this code if there were no software mentions (use coded_no_in_text_mentions instead).

<br />    If you find a mention in a footnote, code the footnote as one mention and the sentence the footnote linked to as another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>- Your first mention, if your initials are AB and the article title is pmcid:2002-22-AM_J_BOT would read pmcid:2002-22-AM_J_BOT_AB01

<tr><td>mention_type             </td><td>Applies to in text mentions. This code applies to the selection and describes if the mention is software or something else and then establishes how certain you are about this. A selection should only be coded if you were sure it was software, from context, or if you had to web search. No need to record things that were clearly not software.
<br />
<br />    If you are unsure if something is software, do a web search or find some other means to establish what the mention is actually referring to.
<br />
<br />    - Use "software" if the mention is software. Note that databases are not examples of software.
<br />
<br />    - Use "algorithm" if the mention is referring to a process or algorithm
<br />
<br />    - Use "hardware" if the mention is referring to a piece of hardware or a physical object (that may or may not have software installed on it)
<br />
<br />    - Use "other" if the mention is none of the above
<br />
<br />    Indicate your certainty on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the most certain about your categorization.
<br />
<br />    Leave a memo explaining how you made your decision about what category it is.
<br />
<br />    If you do not categorize the mention as software (e.g. it is hardware), then you can stop coding the in text selection after this code and delete all other codes that follow.</td><td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>

<br />    If you are coding an in-text mention, enter true if a date is provided that tells you when the software itself was created. When coding an in-text mention, this is is not the date of a cited paper's publication. That means that if the only date in the in-text mention is part of a citation (e.g. "(Jones, 2004)"), then you will enter false.

Use the date as provided in the paper (e.g. 2/3/2001), don't change the format.

<br />    If the URL is embedded, meaning that you see text that is a hyperlink but not the actual URL, mark this code as false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>- http://timat2.sourceforge.net                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>
<tr><td>creator                  </td><td>Applies to both in text mentions and references. This code provides the creator of the software as described in the in text mention or the reference, depending on which you are coding.
<br />
<br />    Enter true if a creator is named. Enter false if no creator is provided. Copy the creator as named in the in text mention or reference and paste it as the label. If multiple creators are named, select them all and enter them into the label.
<br />
<br />    If this is an in-text selection, the creator would be whoever that text indicates the software creator to be, including from an "Author-Year" style citation.
<br />
<br />    If this is a reference selection, the creator is the list of authors, including 'et al.' if relevant. It is ok to have a creator on the in-text_mention and on the associated reference.
<br />
<br />    Delete the label line if no creator is provided in the in text mention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>- If your selection is, 'Software, written by xyz, was used for ...,' then your rdfs:label is xyz.

<br />                  - If your selection is '....coupled to MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA),' your rdfs:label is Universal Imaging Corporation.
<br />
<br />                  - If your selection is '....we used custom imaging software (Jones, 2004),' then your rdfs:label is Jones.

<tr><td>has_reference            </td><td>Applies to in text mentions. This code names the reference that an in text selection cites, if it cites one.
<br />
<br />    It should be named the same thing that the reference is referred to as in its own reference block below. It should start with the article name (e.g. 002-22-AM_J_BOT), followed by an underscore and then enough information to make it a unique name. Using the first author on the reference followed by the date is a good way to ensure uniqueness, but it is possible you will need to append the character a or the character b after the date if there are multiple references by the same author in the same year.
<br />
<br />    If there are no references, delete this code altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>- pmcid-cited:2002-22-AM_J_BOT_Staden-1996
