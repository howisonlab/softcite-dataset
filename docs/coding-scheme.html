<tr><td>has_in_text_mention      </td><td>Applies to article. This code is applied to each in text mention of software.
<br />
<br />    Use this code multiple times, once for each mention. Name the mention so that it is the article title, preceded by an a and followed by an underscore, then your initials, then a number. Start that number at 01 and increment one each time you find a new mention. Doesn't have to match the order the mentions are in the PDF.
<br />
<br />    Do not use this code if there were no software mentions (use coded_no_in_text_mentions instead).
<br />
<br />    If you find a mention in a footnote, code the footnote as one mention and the sentence the footnote linked to as another.                                                                                                                                    </td><td>- Your first mention, if your initials are AB and the article title is 2002-22-AM_J_BOT would read a2002-22-AM_J_BOT_AB01

<br />    Highlight this quote in your pdf. Copy and paste directly from the pdf to this code; there is no need to remove hyphens from line breaks.

<tr><td>has_reference            </td><td>Applies to in text mentions. This code names the reference that an in text selection cites, if it cites one.
<br />
<br />    It should be named the same thing that the reference is referred to as in its own reference block below. It should start with a, followed by the article name (e.g. 002-22-AM_J_BOT), followed by an underscore and then enough information to make it a unique name. Using the first author on the reference followed by the date is a good way to ensure uniqueness, but it is possible you will need to append the character a or the character b after the date if there are multiple references by the same author in the same year.
<br />
<br />    If there are no references, remove this code.                                                                                            </td><td>- a2002-22-AM_J_BOT_Staden-1996

<br />    - Apply "user_guide" if the reference is to a user guide for the software.
<br />
<br />    - Apply "project_page" if the reference is just pointing to the software's online website.
<br />
<br />    - Apply "project_name" if the reference is informal and mentions the name of the software but provides no URL (see examples).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>- If your reference selection is 'STADEN, R. 1996.

<br />                  - If your reference selection is 'MCCUNE, B. 1993. Multivariate analysis on the PC-ORD system. Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon.

It only names the project as an entity that exists.</td></tr>
