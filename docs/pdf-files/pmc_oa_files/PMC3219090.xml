The processes regulating these two opposing pathways have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, using quantitative immunoblots, imaging, and mathematical modeling, we addressed the dynamics of the DED proteins of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), procaspase-8, and cellular FLICE inhibitory proteins (c-FLIPs) to the onset of CD95-mediated ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. We found that CD95 DISC-induced caspase-8 activity is important for the initiation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. The long c-FLIP isoform, c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, and the short c-FLIP isoform, c-FLIP<sub>R</sub>, inhibited MAPK induction by blocking caspase-8 processing at the DISC. Furthermore, we built a mathematical model describing CD95 DISC-mediated MAPK activation and apoptosis. The model quantitatively defined the dynamics of DED proteins, procaspase-8, and c-FLIP, which lead to caspase-8 activation and induction of apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways. In conclusion, the combination of biochemical analysis with mathematical modeling provides evidence for an important role of caspase-8 in CD95-mediated activation of MAPKs, while c-FLIP exerts a regulatory function in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD95</kwd><kwd>caspase-8</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd><kwd>c-FLIP</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>CD95 (APO-1/Fas)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> is a member of the death receptor (DR) family.

Immunoblot (IB) analysis of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 showed that these MAPKs were highly activated upon stimulation of CD95 with anti-APO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The onset of activation was found to be stimulus-dependent for both ERK1/2 and p38. ERK1/2 activation first peaked at 90&#x02009;min for a stimulus of 250&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1, whereas stimulation with 1500&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 led to a first peak of ERK1/2 activation already at 60&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Remarkably, ERK1/2 activation subsequently decreased before it reached a second peak at about 180&#x02009;min for a stimulus of 250&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 and at 120&#x02009;min for stimulation with 1500&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similar to ERK1/2, p38 also showed an earlier detectable onset of activation with the higher stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast to the biphasic activation of ERK1/2, activation of p38 steadily increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The phosphorylation of MAPKs was accompanied by CD95-triggered cleavage of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> into p43-FLIP and procaspase-8a/b processing into p43/p41, p30, and p18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

These data provided the first hint at the involvement of caspase activity in CD95-mediated MAPK activation in our system.</p><p>To analyze caspase-8 involvement in CD95-mediated activation of MAPKs more directly, the HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cell line with stable downregulation of caspase-8 by RNA interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> was used. HeLa-CD95 and HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cells were stimulated with 1000&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 for time periods ranging between 15 and 180&#x02009;min.

Quantification of procaspase-8a/b downregulation in the unstimulated case for all experiments averaged out at a downregulation by 60&#x00025;. In contrast to HeLa-CD95 cell lysates, almost no active procaspase-8a/b cleavage products p43/p41, p30, and p18 were detectable in HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cell lysates.

To further confirm this hypothesis, we included caspase-8-mediated MAPK activation in our previously published mathematical model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> and compared the model trajectories to experimental time-course data. For simplicity, the analysis was restricted to p38 activation. In the model, p38 phosphorylation was assumed to be directly activated by enzymatically active caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). In addition, we considered a p38 dephosphorylation step in the model and assumed it to be not regulated by caspase-8. The ordinary differential equations of the model can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p><p>Our previously published model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> was based on time-course measurements in HeLa-CD95 cells stimulated with CD95L, while agonistic anti-APO-1 antibodies were used as the stimulus in this work. Moreover, the present data set includes a novel experimental condition that was lacking in the calibration of the previous model (i.e., caspase-8 downregulation). We, therefore, derived an improved model by simultaneously fitting all kinetic parameters to the anti-APO-1 and CD95L data sets. Specifically, we assumed that CD95L and anti-APO-1 stimulation conditions solely differ in the biologically active ligand concentration and the ligand binding rate, whereas the kinetic parameters of intracellular reactions are the same for both conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> for fitted parameters). The trajectories of the best-fit model lie within the experimental error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). This further supports our hypothesis that p38 activation occurs downstream of caspase-8 activity.</p><p>The model could reproduce our experimental observation that c-FLIP downregulation and overexpression both block procaspase-8 processing and p38 activation in response to anti-APO-1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, in our previous work, we observed that c-FLIP downregulation does not significantly affect procaspase-8 processing upon CD95L stimulation of HeLa-CD95 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The model explains these different observations upon c-FLIP downregulation by a ligand-specific effect considering that the activity of anti-APO-1 is lower than the activity of CD95L. As procaspase-8 is processed more rapidly in c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>-procaspase-8 heterodimers than in procaspase-8 homodimers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> downregulation can possibly reduce procaspase-8 activation. The absolute concentrations of c-FLIP proteins (each &#x0223c;500 molecules per cell) in HeLa-CD95 cells are much lower than those of CD95 (150&#x02009;000 molecules per cell) and procaspase-8 (250&#x02009;000 molecules per cell).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Given that c-FLIP binds to the CD95 DISC with much higher affinity than its by far more abundant competitor procaspase-8, and that in our model, anti-APO-1 activates slightly less than half of the CD95 pool, while CD95L activates the whole receptor pool, the contribution of c-FLIP heterodimers to procaspase-8 processing are more pronounced upon anti-APO-1 stimulation when compared to CD95L.</p><p>Caspase-8 activity is essential to MAPK activation in response to anti-APO-1 stimulation (see above). Formation of p18 occurs at the DISC by processing of p43/p41 and is modulated by c-FLIP. We, therefore, hypothesized that p18 formation and MAPK activation are controlled by the ratio of p43/p41 and p43-FLIP at the DISC. Thus, the relative concentrations of p43-FLIP and p43/p41 at the DISC were analyzed <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The simulations reveal that the absolute concentrations of p43/p41 and p43-FLIP are poor predictors of p18 formation: for instance, c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> overexpression or c-FLIP downregulation hardly affect maximal DISC recruitment of procaspase-8 despite having significant impact on p18 formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Likewise, p43-FLIP generation at the DISC is essentially unchanged upon procaspase-8 downregulation or c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). However, we note that all conditions with diminished p18 formation are characterized by a strong alteration in the p43-FLIP to p43/p41 ratio at the DISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that the c-FLIP/procaspase-8 ratio is the key to CD95-induced MAPK activation.</p><p>To verify that our model indeed captures the dynamics of protein recruitment and generation of cleavage products at the DISC, we analyzed DISC formation in HeLa-CD95 cells and in HeLa-CD95 cells upon downregulation of procaspase-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). The model predicted that procaspase-8 downregulation delays p43-FLIP generation at the DISC, but does not affect its final level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). With a stimulus of 1000&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1, p43-FLIP at the DISC indeed reached an early saturation level at around 20&#x02009;min in HeLa-CD95 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a and b</xref>). In contrast, the amount of p43-FLIP at the DISC continued to increase in HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cells within 60&#x02009;min of stimulation with anti-APO-1. Moreover, after 20&#x02009;min the level of p43-FLIP was observed to be lower in HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cells than in HeLa-CD95 cells. Taken together, the experiments confirm the decelerated p43-FLIP generation in HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cells as predicted by the model. However, experimental data and the model slightly disagreed at late time points: the model suggested that the final level of p43-FLIP should be unaffected by caspase-8 downregulation, while the experimentally measured p43-FLIP reached a comparably higher level in HeLa-CD95-C8 dr cells after 60&#x02009;min. The model also predicted that the generation of p43/p41 at the DISC should be significantly decreased, at both early and late points of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, top). This prediction agrees well with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We conclude that our model captures the dynamics of protein recruitment to the DISC, and that the ratio of p43/p41 and p43-FLIP at the DISC is dramatically altered in cells with the downregulation of procaspase-8. These effects were found to be even more pronounced upon stimulation with the lower stimulus of 250&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7c and d</xref>). The observation of an altered ratio of c-FLIP to procaspase-8 at the DISC further confirms the data obtained in the present work that demonstrate an essential role for c-FLIP proteins and procaspase-8 in CD95-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The pivotal role of CD95 signaling in the induction of apoptosis is well established. Nevertheless, CD95 signaling is also involved in mediating non-apoptotic pathways. Most prominently, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and MAPKs are activated upon stimulation of CD95.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> As details of these processes remain unknown, the underlying mechanisms are currently under investigation. Caspase-8 and c-FLIP molecules have been attributed crucial roles in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling of CD95.</p><p>In this study, a first integrated kinetic model of CD95-mediated apoptosis and MAPK signaling was proposed. The model together with experimental data obtained using overexpression of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> or downregulation of c-FLIP, as well as inhibition of caspases by zVAD-fmk or downregulation of caspase-8, allowed to make a number of important findings. It was demonstrated that caspase-8 activity plays the central role in CD95-mediated MAPK induction. Furthermore, it was found <italic>in silico</italic> with the following experimental confirmation that it is the ratio of c-FLIP to procaspase-8 at the DISC which plays the central role in the regulation of MAPK induction by defining the amount of active caspase-8 generated at the DISC. It has been reported before that caspase activity plays a crucial role in the induction of the MAPK pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> In our study, we defined that this caspase activity is attributed to the DISC-derived caspase-8 activity and quantitatively analyzed the contribution of DISC dynamics to MAPK activation.</p><p>c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> and c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> were shown to have different functions in CD95 stimulation. c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> acts as an antiapoptotic regulator at the DISC and blocks the activation of procaspase-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> In contrast, the relative cellular concentration of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> in part determines whether c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> exerts a pro- or antiapoptotic function. Although overexpression of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> inhibits activation of procaspase-8, lower concentrations of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> can promote cleavage of procaspase-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Consistent with these data, overexpression of c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> or c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> in HeLa-CD95 cells inhibited the generation of caspase-8 cleavage products in this work. Moreover, cell death occurred to a lesser extent in HeLa-CD95-F<sub>R</sub> or HeLa-CD95-F<sub>L</sub> cells compared to HeLa-CD95 cells.</p><p>Both c-FLIP downregulation and overexpression were demonstrated to block procaspase-8 processing and MAPK activation in response to anti-APO-1 stimulation. Procaspase-8 is processed more rapidly in c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>-procaspase-8 heterodimers than in procaspase-8 homodimers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Thus, c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> can have a catalytic effect on procaspase-8 processing, that is, its downregulation can reduce procaspase-8 activation. This was observed in our experiments and further confirmed using modeling.</p><p>A mechanism has been proposed in which catalytic activity and substrate specificity of caspase-8 are determined by conformation and cleavage status of procaspase-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Specifically, it was suggested that the substrate repertoire of procaspase-8 is restricted to itself and c-FLIP, whereas the active p43/p41-p10 exhibits a broader substrate repertoire, including procaspase-3 and Bid. In this work, procaspase-8 processing is required for CD95-induced activation of MAPKs, as the conditions impairing MAPK activation are accompanied by reduced procaspase-8 processing. Both the first and the second cleavage step are in part affected, pointing out the potential role of p43/p41 and p18 in MAPK activation. The substrate of caspase-8 activity leading to MAPK activation has to be elucidated in the future. In addition, procaspase-10, the second initiator caspase at the DISC, might also contribute to CD95-mediated MAPK activation. It was reported before that it could not substitute caspase-8 in its apoptotic function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> However, the contribution of procaspase-10 to the induction of non-apoptotic pathways remains to be addressed.</p><p>In our modeling approach, we concentrated on early signaling events, which occurred within a few hours after CD95 stimulation. It will be a future challenge to combine a model of CD95-mediated signal transduction with a model of transcriptional regulation to understand the possible feedback from transcriptional regulation by MAPKs on upstream CD95 signaling. In addition, a combination of the CD95-mediated MAPK model with our recent model of the crosstalk between CD95-mediated NF<italic>-&#x003ba;</italic>B induction and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> would provide a more generic view on the mechanism of life/death decisions at CD95.</p><p>Our results support the new paradigm in CD95 signaling that the CD95 DISC can act as a main switch deciding between life and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, we have shown in quantitative terms that the balance between c-FLIP and procaspase-8 regulates the onset of MAPK activation. Interestingly, dynamics of c-FLIP and procaspase-8 at the DISC is also a central regulatory point for NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B induction and apoptosis. These regulatory mechanisms provide an important basis for understanding the crosstalk between non-apoptotic and apoptotic signaling pathways. This knowledge will provide new insights into multiple diseases, in particular with regard to the sensitivity and resistance of cancer cells towards apoptosis, as modulation of the ratio between procaspase-8 and c-FLIP in cancer cells might influence their resistance towards apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>HeLa-CD95 was generated by selection with 20&#x02009;ng/ml puromycin according to standard protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Stable c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> and c-FLIP<sub>R</sub> cell lines were selected with 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml G418 and 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml zeocin, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> HeLa-CD95 cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Germany), 10&#x02009;mM HEPES (Life Technologies), 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies), and 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

Different HeLa-CD95 cell lines were stimulated with 1000&#x02009;ng/ml anti-APO-1 and subjected to time-lapse microscopy. (<bold>a</bold>) Representative images for HeLa-CD95 cells are shown. Apoptosis was detected based on morphological characteristics associated with apoptotic cell death, including condensation of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. White arrows indicate a cell that shows typical characteristics of apoptotic cell death, that is, condensation of the cytosol (45 and 60&#x02009;min), membrane blebbing (180&#x02009;min), and formation of apoptotic bodies (270&#x02009;min). (<bold>b</bold>) For the indicated points in time, the number of cells showing onset of apoptosis characterized by cytoplasm condensation and the total number of cells were counted to determine the percentage of apoptotic cell death. Displayed results are averaged values for five images per cell line and time.
