Thus, CNPs may be both a result and cause of soft tissue calcification processes. This study determined if CNPs could augment calcification of arterial vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>CNPs 210 nm in diameter were propagated in vitro from human serum. Porcine aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured for up to 28 days in medium in the absence (control) or presence of 2 mM phosphate ([P] positive calcification control) or after a single 3-day exposure to CNPs. Transmission electron-microscopy was used to characterize CNPs and to examine their cellular uptake. Calcium deposits were visualized by light microscopy and von Kossa staining and were quantified by colorimetry. Cell viability was quantified by confocal microscopy of live-/dead-stained cells and apoptosis was examined concurrently by fluorescent labeling of exposed phosphatidylserine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CNPs, as well as smaller calcium crystals, were observed by transmission electron-microscopy on day 3 in CNP-treated but not P-treated cells. By day 28, calcium deposits were visible in similar amounts within multicellular nodules of both CNP- and P-treated cells. Apoptosis increased with cell density under all treatments. CNP treatment augmented the density of apoptotic bodies and cellular debris in association with mineralized multicellular nodules.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Exogenous CNPs are taken up by aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro and potentiate accumulation of smooth-muscle-derived apoptotic bodies at sites of mineralization.

Multicellular nodules that subsequently formed from the ridge cells contained a necrotic core of EthD-1-labeled nuclear fragments surrounded by a layer of live cells with associated apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-2689">Figures 5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-2689">F</xref>). It was not possible to quantify cell viability within multicellular nodules using this methodology. However, nodules from CNP-treated cells typically displayed more intense nucleic-acid staining of fragmented cells and greater numbers of apoptotic bodies than was observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-2689">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-2689">H</xref>). After 21 days, monolayer cell viability, determined by calcein AM/EthD-1 labeling, was 97.9%&#x000b1;0.5% in control cultures, and was slightly but significantly reduced to 96.2%&#x000b1;1.0% and 95.6%&#x000b1;0.7% in CNP-treated and 2 mM P-treated cultures, respectively; n=9&#x02013;10 each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-2689">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that human-derived CNPs are taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, promoting accumulation of apoptotic bodies at sites that are colocalized with extracellular mineral deposits. The findings suggest that CNPs modify cellular processes that favor vascular calcification.</p><p>The CNPs that localized within the monolayer of the smooth muscle cells after 3 days most likely originated from those applied to the cells, since they were similar in morphology and elemental composition. In addition, similar structures were not observed in cells cultured in control media. The CNPs used in these experiments were within the size range of synthetic basic calcium phosphate crystals shown to be endocytosed by cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in rapid cell death.<xref rid="b37-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The cell-death effect is attributed to a rise in intracellular Ca following crystal dissolution within lysosomes, and is diminished by preincubating the crystals in serum. In the present investigation, the CNPs used were derived from human serum and were comprised of calcium phosphate and proteins; thus, their protein components (fetuin-A and MGP, for example) could have had a protective effect in this regard by limiting particle endocytosis or intracellular dissolution.</p><p>Confocal microscopy, using fluoroconjugated annexin V and EthD-1 to label apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells, respectively, indicated that monolayer cells were highly viable with low levels of apoptosis, regardless of treatment. Typical of this in vitro model of vascular calcification, retraction of the cells into dense multicellular nodules was associated with increased apoptosis within the nodule cores. The increased density of apoptotic bodies, as well as fragmented nuclei and cellular debris within the nodules of CNP-treated cells, compared to those of untreated cells, and together with the finding of colocalized mineral deposits within nodules of the CNP-treated cells, suggests that CNPs induced mineralization in vascular smooth muscle cells by promoting apoptosis. This effect would likely refect modulation of both pro- and antiapoptotic regulatory processes, for example, activation of BMP-2/smad-induced apoptosis through phosphorylation of Smad1 would result in loss of expression of Bcl-2, an important anti-apoptotic protein.<xref rid="b38-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Another possibility is through downregulation of the vitamin K-dependent growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) and its receptor, Ax1, a tyrosine kinase. Under physiological conditions, the Gas6&#x02013;Ax1 survival pathway functions to protect vascular smooth muscle cells from apoptotic death, partly by inhibiting caspase 3 activation.<xref rid="b39-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, hyperphosphatemia inhibits this pathway by downregulating Gas6 as well as Ax1, and this effect is concurrent with calcium phosphate deposition and increased apoptosis.<xref rid="b41-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Thus, CNPs might have a similar effect in this regard, and these mechanisms could be a focus of future experiments.</p><p>Several possible mechanisms may account for the CNP-induced mineralization observed in this study. Firstly, since the deposits ranged up to several &#x003bc;m in size, which is larger than the individual CNPs that were added, and they were not present after 3 days of cell culture, CNPs that were associated with or taken up into the cells and not directed to lysosomes could have become nidi for mineral deposition. The applied CNPs did in fact have the capacity to accumulate environmental Ca as indicated by the <sup>45</sup>Ca-binding experiments. Secondly, the applied particles could have initiated a series of cellular events that induced or accelerated conversion of the smooth muscle cells to osteogenic bone-forming cells. In vitro studies indicate that the osteogenic markers osteopontin, BMP-2, and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) are upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Notably, the initiating factor for this activation appears to be uptake of calcium phosphate nanocrystals that precipitate into the medium independently of cell activity &#x02013; not soluble phosphate.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b42-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Within the context of the present study, BMP-2 is particularly significant since it initiates a program that enhances the expression of multiple osteogenic transcription factors including Msx-2, Osterix, and runt-related transcription factor 2.<xref rid="b43-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In healthy smooth muscle cells, the osteoinductive properties of BMP-2 are neutralized by its formation of a complex with &#x003b3;-carboxylated MGP, a potent mineralization inhibitor produced by smooth muscle cells, which itself is downregulated in vascular calcification.<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Thus, if CNPs induce BMP-2 upregulation, the increased levels might overwhelm the capacity of &#x003b3;-carboxylated MGP for binding, which would favor mineralization.</p><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>The present findings are consistent with the concept that protein/mineral complexes, CNPs in particular, influence atherosclerotic disease processes, and they are in accord with our previous study in which CNPs injected intravenously into rabbits induced calcification and occlusion at sites of arterial injury in vivo.<xref rid="b45-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Taken together, these results suggest that, under certain circumstances, CNPs are pathological agents. Apoptotic bodies are efficient nucleators of calcium phosphate<xref rid="b30-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and have been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. Increased density of apoptotic bodies is a characteristic feature of arteries of patients on hemodialysis with end-stage renal failure,<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> aortic plaque,<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and calcific aortic valves.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Increased apoptosis localized to shoulder regions of arterial plaque may also contribute to plaque instability by thinning of the fibrous cap.<xref rid="b47-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p><p>Under physiological conditions, CNPs function to remove excess Ca and P from soft tissues by entering the circulation, which is followed by clearance by the reticuloendothelial system via scavenger receptor-A-mediated endocytosis, primarily in the liver and spleen.<xref rid="b49-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> In diseases characterized by hyperphosphatemia, their formation increases and clearance mechanisms could be overwhelmed, favoring mineral deposition within the vascular extracellular matrix. Consistent with this concept are our previous studies, which demonstrated that CNPs were detectable in calcific but not healthy human arteries, and that they could be propagated in vitro from calcific vessel isolates, provided sufficient P was available.<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Effects of CNPs are likely to be modulated partly by their protein components. In vitro studies show that CNPs are pleomorphic, ie, their composition changes reflective of the constituents within their local environment.<xref rid="b20-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus, the proteinaceous makeup of the CNPs would be expected to vary in vivo depending upon the relative availability of specific mineral-binding proteins in the extracellular milieu, which would influence pathological events such as apoptosis. For example, levels of fetuin-A and MGP in the circulation are altered in chronic kidney disease and diabetes,<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b50-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> which would likely affect the composition of circulating CNPs and, ultimately, contribute to vascular mineral deposition. Furthermore, the proportion and amount of fetuin-A complexed with mineral relative to free fetuin-A appears to be dynamic, since the complexes are undetectable in normal human serum but present in serum from patients with chronic kidney disease, and they increase in quantity in parallel with disease severity.<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>A possible contribution for CNPs in progression of atherosclerosis should be viewed within the context of other similar-sized entities, such as smooth-muscle-derived membrane-bound matrix vesicles, which share certain functional features in promoting calcification. Both are localized to vascular plaque in vivo and increase in response to pathological elevations in extracellular mineral.<xref rid="b16-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b52-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b53-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Smooth-muscle-derived matrix vesicles may also serve as nucleation foci for Ca deposition.<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b53-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> However, it is yet unknown whether CNPs act in combination with matrix vesicles to promote calcification. Additionally, membrane-bound microvesicles, primarily shed from platelets, are present in the circulation, and microvesicles of leukocyte, endothelial, and smooth muscle origin accumulate within atherosclerotic plaques.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b52-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Evidence that these microvesicles participate directly in vascular calcification are lacking; however, circulating endothelial microvesicles impair endothelial function,<xref rid="b54-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and plaque microvesicles, which are more concentrated than those in the circulation, are more thrombogenic,<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-2689" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> thus contributing to atherosclerosis through proinflammatory and procoagulant mechanisms.</p><p>Improved methodologies are needed for isolation and analysis of protein/mineral complexes, such as CNPs used in this study, in order to more fully understand their character and to provide uniformity in classification. Since these complexes have the capacity to induce osteogene expression and apoptosis &#x02013; two processes which precede calcification within the vasculature &#x02013; the ability to identify and quantitate possible diagnostic markers of cardiovascular disease, such as using CNPs isolated from serum, would be beneficial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CNPs are internalized by vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, resulting in accumulation of apoptotic bodies at sites correspondent with extracellular matrix mineralization. Because apoptotic bodies are localized to sites of calcification in the vasculature, and apoptosis is an important regulator of calcification, CNPs may augment vascular calcification under circumstances in which normal physiological processes for CNP clearance from the local environment are disrupted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported in part by a developmental research grant from the Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, NIH R21 Grant HL88988, and the John E Fetzer Memorial Trust.
