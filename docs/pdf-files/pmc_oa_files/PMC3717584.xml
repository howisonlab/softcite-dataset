We aimed to use National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data to track the work status of emergency physicians compared with other specialists. The hypothesis is that emergency physicians will leave their specialty more frequently than other hospital-based specialists because of high stress and burnout.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Data sources</title><p>The healthcare providers files of the NHI claims data were used in this study. Study subjects were physicians who were specialists certified by Department of Health in Taiwan between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2010. We enrolled three types of specialists for comparison: emergency physicians, surgeons and radiologists/pathologists. Surgeons included neurosurgeons, general surgeons, plastic surgeons and orthopaedists. Radiologists/pathologists included radiologists, pathologists and nuclear medicine specialists. Physicians have to pass the board-certification examinations to become specialists.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of attrition</title><p>In Taiwan, it is uncommon for emergency physicians, surgeons and radiologists/pathologists to practise in institutes other than hospitals. As a result, if a specialist changed his or her licence registration institute to an outpatient-based clinic, it would be recognised as &#x02018;failure&#x02019;. If the work status was labelled as &#x02018;inactive&#x02019; in the NHI database, he or she would not perform any kind of medical-related practice and it would also be recognised as &#x02018;failure&#x02019;. If the physician kept working in the hospital during the study period, he would be labelled censored (non-event). Finally, if the physician was not registered in any healthcare institutions during the study period, he or she would also be labelled as &#x02018;censored&#x02019;. The follow-up period would be defined from the authorisation date of the specialty licence until the date of failure or censoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables were compared with one-way analysis of variance, and categorical variables with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. 95% CI and p value were reported. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. We first used log-rank test to examine whether different types of specialists had statistically different survival functions, and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves were plotted to show the trend.</p><p>We further used a multivariate Cox regression model to adjust for age when the physician became the specialist and gender to calculate the HR of failure. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software for Windows, V.9.2 (SAS Institute Inc) and STATA V.11.2 (StataCorp).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 16&#x02008;666 physicians (1584 emergency physicians, 12&#x02008;103 surgeons and 2979 radiologists/pathologists) were identified between 1997 and 2010.

First, although this is the largest and most comprehensive public source for information about specialists in Taiwan, we cannot check the accuracy of these secondary data and some information is missing. Second, physicians might have different certified specialties and might register in the institutes using specialties other than our study interests. For example, an emergency physician might also be a certified cardiologist, and work in the hospital as a cardiologist and a part-time emergency physician. In our study cohort, he would be labelled as censored.</p><p>Many physicians work in the emergency department (ED) without this being their specialism, but in our database, we can capture only physicians with certified specialties. As a result, in the study we evaluated only the attrition of specialists instead of all physicians working in the ED. Finally, attrition was defined by primary type of practice and it is possible that physicians labelled as &#x02018;failure&#x02019; work part time in emergency medicine clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this observational study is the first to use a large cohort to follow up the working lives of emergency physicians. Based on the available information, only 0.63% of emergency physicians left emergency medicine clinical practice during the 14&#x02005;years of observation. Cross-sectional examination of the data shows that the attrition rate is extremely low compared with reported rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11 b12 b13 b14 b15">11&#x02013;15</xref> However, if individual observation periods are taken into account, we found that the &#x02018;survival&#x02019; was significantly decreased after 10&#x02005;years. In comparison with the other two kinds of specialists, the adjusted HRs were also significantly high. The findings demonstrate that the low annual attrition rate of emergency physicians may be too optimistic.</p><p>According to our findings, emergency physicians are about to leave this field when they are fully experienced. This would be a loss for the training programme of this specialty, and also for patients. Strategies to keep experienced emergency physicians in their &#x02018;battlefields&#x02019;&#x02014;for example, by developing a less labour-intensive subspecialty (eg, disaster preparedness)&#x02014;should be emphasised. In this way, emergency physicians might continue to work in hospitals passing on their experience when their physical ability declines.</p><p>In summary, our study found that despite the low annual attrition rate, in the long term there is a high probability that emergency physicians will leave their specialties compared with other specialists, possibly owing to the high stress of emergency medicine. Further strategies should be planned to retain experienced emergency physicians in their specialties.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study is based in part on data from the National Health Insurance Research Database provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health, and managed by the National Health Research Institutes (registered number 99018 &#x00026; 99321).
