In this study, db/db mice were treated with DA-9801 (30 and 100 mg/kg, daily, <italic>p.o.</italic>) for 12 weeks. DA-9801 reduced the blood glucose levels and increased the withdrawal latencies in hot plate tests. Moreover, it prevented nerve damage based on increased nerve conduction velocity and ultrastructural changes. Decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) may have a detrimental effect on diabetic neuropathy. We previously reported NGF regulatory properties of the <italic>Dioscorea</italic> genus. In this study, DA-9801 induced NGF production in rat primary astrocytes. In addition, it increased NGF levels in the sciatic nerve and the plasma of type 2 diabetic animals. DA-9801 also increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of Tieg1/Klf10, an NGF target gene, in PC12 cells. These results demonstrated the attenuation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy by oral treatment with DA-9801 <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation. DA-9801 is currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DA-9801</kwd><kwd><italic>Dioscorea japonica</italic> Thunb</kwd><kwd><italic>Dioscorea nipponica</italic> Makino</kwd><kwd>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy</kwd><kwd>Nerve growth factor</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus usually develop severe complications such as microvascular and macrovascular diseases, retinopathy, liver and brain dysfunctions, and neuropathy (<xref rid="b8-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Gerbitz <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b35-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Toth <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus, with nerve damage developing in over 50% of all diabetic patients. It is associated with chronic aberrant sensations, numbness, and pain, which affect quality of life, disrupt sleep, and can lead to depression (<xref rid="b41-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Vinik <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b40-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Vinik <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b4-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Calcutt, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b5-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Canta <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Currently, drugs for diabetic neuropathy have been limited to those that reduce pain and relieve other symptoms. The antiepileptics gabapentin (GABA) and the antioxidant &#x003b1;-lipoic acid (LA) are common drugs used to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. However, GABA has been reported to cause side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, and peripheral edema (<xref rid="b37-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2009</xref>). LA can cause nausea or stomach upset, fatigue, and insomnia (<xref rid="b32-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Jialal, 2008</xref>). Therefore, research is underway to find safer candidates for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>The pathological processes of diabetic peripheral neuropathy are not yet fully understood. However, possible etiologic factors have been suggested. They include long-standing hyperglycemia, increased flux of the polyol pathway, enhanced non-enzymatic advanced glycation end-product formation, free radical and oxidative stress, and impaired nerve growth factor (NGF) support (<xref rid="b44-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Zorrilla Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b31-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Sima and Sugimoto, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b38-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">van Dam, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b25-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Obrosova, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b39-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Vincent <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Several studies suggest that NGF deficiency may be one of the major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy (<xref rid="b10-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hellweg and Hartung, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="b2-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Apfel <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b11-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hellweg <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b28-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Ordonez <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b1-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Anand <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). NGF levels in the sciatic nerve of experimental diabetic animals with neuropathy decreased significantly in comparison with those in normal animals. When diabetic animals were treated with NGF or enhancers of endogenous NGF synthesis, neuropathy-related abnormalities such as reduced nerve conduction velocity, atrophy of myelinated nerve fibers and axons, and dysesthesia were statistically significantly alleviated compared with that in untreated animals (<xref rid="b29-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Pearlstone <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="b2-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Apfel <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b17-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kakinoki <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In oriental medicine, the dried rhizome of <italic>Dioscorea japonica</italic> Thunb (<italic>D. japonica</italic>, known as &#x0201c;SanYak&#x0201d; in Korea) is a representative nourishing and tonifying herb. Its taste is sweet, and its nature is neutral. It supplements <italic>Ki</italic>, fortifies the spleen, supplements the lungs and the kidney, and secures the essence. It has been traditionally used for diarrhea and dysentery due to spleen deficiency, fatigue, coughing and wheezing, wasting and thirsting, seminal emission, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination. The dried rhizome of <italic>Dioscorea nipponica</italic> Makino (<italic>D. nipponica</italic>) is called &#x0201c;Buchema&#x0201d; in Korea, and is an herb for clearing and transforming phlegm-heat. Its taste is bitter and its nature is cold. It dissipates lumps and disperses goiter, clears heat, relieves toxicity, cools the blood, stops bleeding and coughing, and calms wheezing. It has been applied for goiter and scrofula, swelling and toxins of sores, poisonous snake bites, bleeding due to blood-heat, and whooping cough (<xref rid="b43-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Wang, 2002</xref>). Many species of <italic>Dioscorea</italic> have traditionally been used clinically in Asia for the treatment of various syndromes related to metabolic diseases. Moreover, the extracts of the <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species have been reported to have antidiabetic and antiobesity effects (<xref rid="b12-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hikino <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="b7-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b22-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Maithili <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In particular, <italic>D. japonica</italic> has inhibitory activities on polyuria and diabetes (<xref rid="b20-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 1998</xref>) and <italic>D. nipponica</italic> has antiobesity properties (<xref rid="b16-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Previously, we reported that furostanol saponins isolated from <italic>D. japonica</italic> upregulated NGF contents in rat glioma C6 cells (<xref rid="b19-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011a</xref>) and diosgenin from <italic>D. nipponica</italic> ameliorated diabetic neuropathy by increasing the endogenous NGF levels in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice (<xref rid="b18-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we proposed that these two <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species might improve various symptoms of diabetic neuropathy <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation. Through activity-guided <italic>in vivo</italic> screening, we selected an optimized combination drug DA-9801, a mixture of <italic>D. japonica</italic> and <italic>D. nipponica</italic> (KR Patent No. 10-1341692-0000). NGF agonistic activities of DA-9801 in PC12 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons were recently reported (<xref rid="b21-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011b</xref>). Jin <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that oral treatment with DA-9801 had therapeutic potential for peripheral neuropathy in a representative type 1 diabetic animal model, STZ-induced diabetic rats (<xref rid="b15-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). According to this report, DA-9801 improved tactile and thermal hyperalgesia, and blunted the morphological changes and the reduction of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Moreover, it increased NGF and decreased tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and interleukin-6 protein levels in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord. These results indicated that DA-9801 might prevent peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats <italic>via</italic> enhancement of neurotrophic activity and anti-inflammatory response. Previously, our group described that DA-9801 improved nerve conduction velocity (NCV) significantly in type 2 diabetic db/db mice (<xref rid="b6-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Choi and Son, 2011</xref>). However, further investigations of DA-9801 in peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic animal models have not been reported. Because of the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than type 1, it is very importance to check the impact of DA-9801 on type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DA-9801 on improvement of peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In particular, to determine its therapeutic mechanism, we focused on the NGF regulatory activity of DA-9801.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dried <italic>D. japonica</italic> and <italic>D. nipponica</italic> were purchased at a specialty market for traditional herbal medicine (Kyungdong herb market, Seoul, Korea), and their identity was confirmed by Dr. Changsoo Yuk (a specialist in plant classification, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea). Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium and Minimum Essential medium-&#x003b1; (MEM-&#x003b1;), fetal bovine serum (FBS), horse serum (HS), and penicillin-streptomycin (PS) were purchased from Gibco-BRL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Specific primers (NGF, Tieg1/Klf10, and GAPDH), M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from TaKaRa (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). The rat &#x003b2;-NGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay development kit was obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

In this study, the modulators of diabetic neuropathy, &#x003b1;-lipoic acid and gabapentin, were used as positive controls. The oral administration of vehicle or drugs was performed once per day for 12 weeks.

Then, their motor and sensory nerves were isolated. Each isolated nerve was connected to a stimulator and sensor probes with aeration. The distance between the sensor and stimulator probes was 15.0 mm. A digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 2211, Madell Technology Co., Ontario, CA, USA) was used to record the conduction times (3&#x02013;5V stimulation and 5 milliseconds duration). The NCV was calculated based on the time and the distance between the electrodes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Morphometric analysis in the sciatic nerves</title><p>Morphometric analysis in the sciatic nerves was also performed using the methods reported by Kang (<xref rid="b18-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-bt-22-445">Fig. 2A</xref>, treatment with DA-9801 significantly increased NGF secretion. The contents of NGF in the medium were 31.7 &#x000b1; 5.8 pg/ml in control cells and 319.6 &#x000b1; 2.3 and 609.4 &#x000b1; 57.1 pg/ml in DA-9801-treated cells (100 and 200 &#x003bc;g/ml), respectively.

We also measured NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice treated with DA-9801.

Nerve damage such as the loss and centripetal degeneration of small myelinated axons in diabetic neuropathy is likely associated with a marked deprivation of NGF. Jin <italic>et al</italic>. reported the therapeutic potential of DA-9801 on the peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> enhancement of neurotrophic activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats, a representative type 1 diabetic model (<xref rid="b15-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). To extend the research on DA-9801, we investigated whether DA-9801 had therapeutic activity for peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation in db/db mice, a type 2 diabetic animal model. In the present study, oral administration of DA-9801 significantly reduced hyperalgesia by increasing the response latency to noxious thermal stimuli in db/db mice. DA-9801-administrated group showed higher NCVs of sensory and motor nerves than each diabetic control group. Accordingly, DA-9801 may have a therapeutic effect on nerve injury due to diabetic neuropathy by increasing the transmission speed of the nerves of db/db mice. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of the DA-9801 on the neuropathy was identified by measuring the histological change of the sciatic nerves. Namely, in the DA-9801-treated groups, the axon and the myelin sheath in the central part of the sciatic nerve clearly expanded. These data show that DA-9801 can protect and treat the shrunken sciatic nerves in the neuropathy in type 2 diabetic condition. Moreover, DA-9801 increased NGF production in rat primary astrocytes. In addition, the amounts of endogenous NGF in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice were significantly higher than that of control mice. Therefore, our results indicate that oral treatment with DA-9801 might improve peripheral neuropathy by suppressing the degeneration and death of neurons in type 2 diabetes <italic>via</italic> NGF induction.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about 90% of all diabetes cases. Its main pathological cause is insulin resistance which associated with aging, obesity, and lack of physical activity (<xref rid="b3-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Boden, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the importance of investigating type 2 diabetes and its complications has increased markedly with the trends of an increasingly aging and obese society. Previously, Jin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that oral treatment with DA-9801 at a single dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 16 weeks had therapeutic properties for peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats <italic>via</italic> enhancement of neurotrophic activity (<xref rid="b15-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). They used Sprague-Dawley rats injected intraperitoneally with STZ 60 mg/kg in their research. Their animal model was a late-state type 2 diabetic or typical type 1 diabetic model. However, chemical-induced diabetic animals have some disadvantages in a general type 2 diabetes study. Hyperglycemia develops primarily by direct cytotoxic actions on the &#x003b2; cells and insulin deficiency, rather than as a consequence of insulin resistance. Moreover, these animals cannot show the phenotype of obesity. However, db/db mice, in which diabetes develops spontaneously with genetic background, can develop characteristic features resembling human type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="b34-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Srinivasan and Ramarao, 2007</xref>). Therefore, db/db mice are a more suitable animal model than STZ-induced diabetic rats in the study of human type 2 diabetes and its complications. Thus, our research showed the therapeutic effect of DA-9801 on peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation in general type 2 diabetes. In comparison, Jin&#x02019;s research ascertained the attenuation of neuropathy by DA-9801 treatment in type 1 and late type 2 diabetes. And to conclude, DA-9801 might improve peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>NGF agonistic activities of DA-9801 were recently published. In that study, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported that DA-9801 had a significant effect on neurite outgrowth and phosphorylation of TrkA, a high-affinity catalytic receptor for NGF (<xref rid="b21-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011b</xref>). In this study, we also found that DA-9801 increased neurite outgrowth and NGF target gene Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA expression in PC12 cells. These results indicate that DA-9801 may act not only as an NGF inducer but also as an NGF mimetic. Therefore, we suggest that DA-9801 may improve diabetic peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation and that it may be used to treat various diabetic complications associated with NGF deficiency.</p><p>Our study showed that DA-9801 was more active than LA and GABA. Until now, drugs to target NGF regulation (such as NGF inducer or NGF mimetics) in diabetic neuropathy have not yet been developed. Therefore, we were confronted with difficulty in our study because there was no suitable positive control. GABA, as a first line drug for the regulation neuropathic pain, is used to relieve diabetic neuropathic pain. Also, there is evidence that LA may help with control of diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, we decided to use GABA and LA as alternative positive controls because they are drugs used to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Sure, GABA or LA is not perfect positive control of diabetic neuropathy because of its side effects and low efficacy. Considering these aspects, we used LA or GABA as a proper positive control. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of GABA and/or LA on neuropathic pain in db/db mice have not been reported yet. Our study is the first to examine the efficacy of these drugs in type 2 diabetic db/db mice.</p><p>In this study, we confirmed the effects of two doses of DA-9801 on diabetic neuropathy and NGF induction. However, the effects of DA-9801 on blood glucose levels, NCVs and nerve histology might be independent of the dose. The thermal response latencies and NGF levels in sciatic nerves showed increasing tendencies but there was no statistical significance between the two doses. These dose-independent effects may be caused by various ingredients in DA-9801. Therefore, more research on various doses of DA-9801 and its most active compounds in diabetic neuropathy are needed in <italic>in vivo</italic> animal systems. According to previous studies, we suggest that furostanol sapogenins (<xref rid="b19-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011a</xref>) and diosgenin (<xref rid="b18-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) may be the main active components of DA-9801.</p><p>Nerve damage and diabetic neuropathic pain can be induced by various pathological causes such as increased al-dose reductase activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme activation, and the proinflammatory response (<xref rid="b26-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Obrosova, 2009</xref>). Previous studies reported that many <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species exert potential activities against these pathological factors in various experimental models. <italic>Dioscorea opposite</italic> prevents the increase of serum aldose reductase activity in STZ-induced diabetic mice (<xref rid="b9-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hayes <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>). The tuber storage protein of <italic>Dioscorea alata</italic>, dioscorin (<xref rid="b14-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and red mold <italic>Dioscorea</italic> (<xref rid="b42-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities. Moreover, some <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species and their constituents are known to have anti-inflammatory properties (<xref rid="b27-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Oh and Lim, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b13-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Hiransai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b24-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Nguelefack <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b23-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Mbiantcha <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Considering the previous references, the inhibitory activities of DA-9801 on diabetic neuropathy may be exerted by multi-targeted pharmacological activities of the <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species. Jin <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that DA-9801 had therapeutic properties for peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats <italic>via</italic> NGF regulation and an anti-inflammatory response. DA-9801 decreased tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and interleukin-6 protein levels in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord (<xref rid="b15-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Therefore, further studies of the potential mechanism of DA-9801, especially its anti-inflammatory properties, in peripheral neuropathy in a type 2 diabetic model are needed. Due to the different pathogenesis between type 1 diabetes and type 2diabetes, their induced inflammation may also be followed by different features. Especially, the main pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, results in complex alterations of lipid and glucose homeostasis, which lead to systemic inflammation (<xref rid="b30-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Pedicino <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In previous comparative study of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, the level of an inflammation marker was higher in serum of type 2 diabetic patients than in that of type 1 diabetic patients (<xref rid="b30-bt-22-445" ref-type="bibr">Pedicino <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Therefore, if DA-9801 can promote peripheral neuropathy <italic>via</italic> its anti-inflammatory activity in type 2 diabetes, it is possible that this activity would be more sensitive in type 2 diabetes than type 1diabetes.</p><p>This study shows that DA-9801, a novel botanical drug from the <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species, reduced blood glucose levels and increased the response latency to noxious thermal stimuli. It also improved peripheral nerve damage by increasing NCVs and ameliorating abnormal nerve histology in db/db type 2 diabetic mice. These results may have occurred partially due to the effect of DA-9801 on NGF regulation. Currently, DA-9801 is being evaluated in a phase II clinical study. We expect that DA-9801 can be used as a botanical drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Korea Health 21 R&#x00026;D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (A111082).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-bt-22-445"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anand</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Terenghi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopelman</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams-Chestnut</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinicropi</surname><given-names>DV</given-names></name></person-group><year>1996</year><article-title>The role of endogenous nerve growth factor in human diabetic neuropathy</article-title><source>Nat Med</source><volume>2</volume><fpage>703</fpage><lpage>707</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8640566</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-bt-22-445"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apfel</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Arezzo</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Brownlee</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Federoff</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><year>1994</year><article-title>Nerve growth factor administration protects against experimental diabetic sensory neuropathy</article-title><source>Brain Res</source><volume>634</volume><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7512429</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-bt-22-445"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boden</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><year>2001</year><article-title>Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

To investigate the effects of DA-9801 on the improvement of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, we administered DA-9801 (30 and 100 mg/kg) once per day orally for 12 weeks in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Then we evaluated (A) the blood glucose levels and (B) the thermal hyperalgesia latencies using hot plate test, and measured (C) nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in motor and sensory nerves. Statistical comparisons between different groups were performed using a one-way ANOVA test followed by Newman-Keuls multiple range test. Values with a superscript are significantly different from the control group (<sup>A</sup><italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 and <sup>B</sup><italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) or LA-treated group (<sup>a</sup><italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) or GABA-treated group (<sup>&#x003b1;</sup><italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). We also confirmed (D) the sciatic nerve histology using electron microscopy, and then (E) the axon diameter and (F) the thickness of the myelin sheath in the sciatic nerves. *<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 and **<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 indicate statistically significant differences from the control group (Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). &#x003b1;-Lipoic acid (LA, 50 mg/kg) and gabapentin (GABA, 100 mg/kg) were used as positive controls.

To determine the effect of DA-9801 on NGF production, rat primary astrocytes were treated with various concentrations of DA-9801. After 24 h, (A) NGF content in the medium was measured using a rat &#x003b2;NGF assay kit. (B) NGF mRNA expression was confirmed <italic>via</italic> reverse transcription PCR after 2 h of DA-9801 treatment. Also, we measured (C) NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and (D) the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice. To investigate the NGF-mimetic activity of DA-9801, we treated PC12 cells with 125 &#x003bc;g/ml of DA-9801. The neurite outgrowth per cell was observed every other day, and (E) images were taken of randomly selected fields using a camera attached to a microscope at 4 days. (F) The neurite length was determined using the Optimas 6.5 program (Media Cybernetics, MD, USA). The differentiation of PC12 cells was scored as follows: cells without neurite outgrowth (0); cells bearing neurites as long as one cell diameter (1); cells bearing neurites two times longer in length than their diameter (2); and cells that had synapse-like neurites (4). (G) We also detected Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA by reverse transcription PCR after 6 h of DA-9801 treatment. In this study, 50 ng/ml NGF was used as a positive control.
