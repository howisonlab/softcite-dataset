Beside the expected promoters located in front of the coding sequences we found a considerable amount of intragenic promoter-like signals with a putative ability to drive either antisense or alternative transcription and revealed unusual genomic regions with extremely high density of predicted transcription start points (promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019;), some of which are located in coding sequences. PlatProm scores converted into probability of RNA polymerase binding demonstrated certain correlation with the enzyme retention registered by ChIP-on-chip technique; however, in &#x02018;dense&#x02019; regions the value of correlation coefficient is lower than throughout the entire genome. Experimental verification confirmed the ability of RNA polymerase to interact and form multiple open complexes within promoter &#x02018;island&#x02019; associated with <italic>appY</italic>, yet transcription efficiency was lower than might be expected. Analysis of expression data revealed the same tendency for other promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019;, thus assuming functional relevance of non-productive RNA polymerase binding. Our data indicate that genomic DNA of <italic>E. coli</italic> is enriched by numerous unusual promoter-like sites with biological role yet to be understood.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Even though expression data are now available for many organisms, a possibility to use them for tracking cell transcriptional output upon varying conditions requires a comprehensive map of genome regulatory elements. Currently there are two approaches opening a way to depict this map: computational search of promoter regions [most recent algorithms: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">1&#x02013;10</xref>)], and ChIP-on-chip spotting of RNA polymerase (RNAPol)-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). In this study we tried to understand how predictable the data obtained <italic>in silico</italic> are and to what extent they correlate with the data obtained <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been performed by our pattern recognition software PlatProm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, PlatProm has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Upon scanning PlatProm considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by PlatProm; evaluate the degree of correlation between PlatProm scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one &#x02018;island&#x02019; to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>An essence of computational approach</title><p>Our scoring system was designed as originally suggested by Hertz and Stormo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <italic>Sensitivity</italic> of this algorithm tested on our sets was the same as reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). To increase the performance of this approach, we took into account sequence-dependent structural features in the genomic environment of promoter sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The final version of PlatProm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) was refined on 271 experimentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by the previous version of our software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). All sequences were 411-bp long (&#x02212;255/+155 according to the start point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, and the distance between the TSP and the element &#x02013;10 were 14&#x02013;21 and 2&#x02013;9 bp, respectively. Variable length of the spacer was accounted by the matrix penalizing deviations from the optimal 17 bp in accordance with their frequencies in the training promoter set. The varying distance between element &#x02212;10 and the TSP, ignored by previously published protocols, was taken into account the same way. Weight matrices corresponding to consensus elements &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 evaluated hexanucleotides, rather than 25 and 19 bp sequences, accounted by Hertz and Stormo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). They contain 6 &#x000d7; 4 scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized occurrence frequencies for each nucleotide at each position in preliminarily aligned promoters. Percentage of particular nucleotides in the genome was used for normalization. Sequence preference nearby the TSP previously accounted by a 12 &#x000d7; 4 weight matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) was scored by the matrix precisely reflecting the distribution of dinucleotides in &#x02212;1/0. Dinucleotides forming the &#x02018;extended &#x02212;10 element&#x02019; were accounted the same way. Since frequency coefficients depend on promoter alignment, optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation&#x02013;maximization.

These matrices represent:

Cascade matrices consider all sequence elements dominant in a particular promoter subregion, but only the most significant one found in a certain promoter is taken into account. Thus, for instance, there are 30 motifs dominating in the region &#x02212;48/&#x02212;41. The most frequent of them, hence the most significant one, is ATAA if located in position &#x02212;44. It gives 0.91 to the overall score. Slightly less significant (contribution 0.82) is TATA if located in &#x02212;45. Thus, for promoter containing TATAT in &#x02212;45/&#x02212;41 the overall score increases by 0.82, while for promoter, containing TATAA &#x02013; by 0.91, rather than by 0.91+0.82. Lack of accounted motifs in a particular subregion of a promoter was penalized based on probability of their absence in this place in the training set.</p><p>Ten cascade matrices were used to formalize the presence of mixed w-tracts (w = A = T), highly typical for promoter DNA. They are regularly distributed with 1 or 1.5 helix turns periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) and may participate in polymerase sliding along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). To focus attention on the observed regularity we search for (www(<italic>n</italic>)<sub>7,8</sub>www and (www(<italic>n</italic>)<sub>13,14</sub>www thus minimizing overlap with (A)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>- and (T)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>-specific matrices.</p><p>PlatProm also takes into account perfect direct and inverted repeats (5&#x02013;11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp) as potential targets for interaction with regulatory proteins. They are scored as natural logarithms of lengths if centered in subregions of their frequent occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>The contributions of both types of repeats and elements accounted by cascade matrices were reduced by coefficients estimated as a ratio of the average information content [quantified as described in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)] in the particular subregion to the information content in the sixth position of the aligned element &#x02013;35 (the least significant among conservative base pairs). This reduction was aimed to balance the endowment of additional elements with that of conservative base pairs. Inputs of all elements were summarized, giving the total score (<italic>S</italic>), which reflects the probability for any nucleotide to be a TSP and therefore the probability of its upstream region to bind RNAPol and fulfill promoter function.</p><p>Performance of the program was tested on a set of 290 known promoters and two control sets (CSs). All sequences were 411 bp long (&#x02212;255/+155 according to real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was composed of experimentally characterized &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters not included in the training set. To increase the size of this set we allowed the presence of promoters (&#x0223c;30%) with multiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 700 bp, separated by &#x02264;50-bp intergenic space, which are not associated with promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; (see below) and have 5&#x02032;-ends similarly annotated in U00096 and U00096.2 <italic>E. coli</italic> gene maps. Sequences were taken so as virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents natural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 was composed of 400 random sequences with the same AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations are available by request.) Promoters were considered as recognized by PlatProm if experimentally mapped TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (&#x000b1;2) had score higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the last version of PlatProm we identified 85.5% of promoters from the test compilation at zero level of false positives (level 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) in both CSs (<italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub> = 3.4). Thus, at this level the combination of <italic>sensitivity</italic> (percentage of recognized promoters = 85.5%) and <italic>specificity</italic> (percentage of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of PlatProm was better than that of previously suggested algorithms (68.7&#x02013;82% and 82.2&#x02013;99.1%, respectively) [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C]. Approximately 80% of recognized promoters possess experimentally mapped TSPs coinciding (in the range of &#x000b1; 2 bp) with positions of local <italic>S</italic> maxima, i.e. nearly 70% of natural TSPs are accurately predicted by our software, which is also better than previously reported (&#x0003c;50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain was used as a source of genomic DNA and total RNA.

All promoter-specific elements in P<italic><sub>dcuA</sub></italic> are weakly pronounced, thus no refinement of the current scoring system can compensate for these negative values. Although it can not be excluded that P<italic><sub>dcuA</sub></italic> has some important determinants, which are not formalized by PlatProm, limitations of experimental mapping performed by primer extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) also may result in some difference between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of transcription initiation would be pointed out downstream from the real one. PlatProm predicts a good candidate (P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered by ChIP-on-chip assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Thus, comparing <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data one should take into account finite <italic>sensitivity</italic> and <italic>selectivity</italic> of computer model as well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. Even though PlatProm may be further improved on the basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed regions.</p><sec><title>Genome scanning revealed unexpected intragenic promoters</title><p>The genome sequence of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (NCBI, GenBank entry U00096.2) was used for large-scale promoter prediction (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link> for all PlatProm scores on both strands). Only signals with <italic>S</italic> &#x0003e;7.44 (level 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D) were considered reliable. This cut-off level provides a possibility to identify only 51.0% of known promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D) but ensures <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.000043 (Student's <italic>T</italic>-test statistics) if average <italic>S</italic> (&#x02212;5.0) and SD (3.1) were estimated using scores of CS1. Artificially generated sequences of CS2 showed the same variability of <italic>S</italic> (SD = 3.1) but average score was higher (&#x02212;4.2), thus assuming &#x0223c;2.5-fold higher <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00011). A total of 30 188 individual or clustered TSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) forming &#x0223c;5000 promoter-like regions were found. Since only half of known promoters have TSPs with <italic>S</italic> &#x0003e;7.44, the data obtained presume existence of more than 9000 of separate promoter-like sites, which is twice greater than the number of annotated genes in the genome of <italic>E. coli</italic>. To what extent this excess could be explained by the presence of false positives?</p><p>Relying on <italic>p</italic>-values only 399&#x02013;928 of 30 188 predicted TSPs (1&#x02013;3%) may be false signals (4 639 675 bp &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; <italic>p</italic>). However, intragenic and artificial sequences of CS1 and CS2 may be deficient in some promoter-specific features. That is why PlatProm performance was further tested in intergenic regions separating convergent genes, even though each of them may contain yet unidentified genes. Predicted TSPs were searched in the central part of intergenic space (&#x02265;250 bp from the ends of flanking genes) so as to ensure that only non-coding sequences undergo scoring. Only 15 regions between convergent genes are longer than 500 bp but two of them overlap with promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; (see below) and were eliminated. The total length of the remaining ones is 10 226 bp (both strands). As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher (49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they contain four predicted TSPs (one per &#x0223c;2500 bp). If all of them are spurious, the probability to come across a false positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than <italic>p</italic>-values mentioned above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted by Carter <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and one is located in front of IS yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning procedure correspond to each other. Even if <italic>p</italic> = 0.00039 is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still &#x0223c;90% of TSPs predicted by PlatProm should be considered as promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis.</p><p>An important question is how to perceive PlatProm signals forming clusters near real and accurately recognized by PlatProm TSPs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B for example). Should they be considered as false positives or not? To address this question we compared distribution of scores in positions surrounding real (test compilation) and virtual (CS1) transcription starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E&#x02013;G). An average <italic>S</italic> quantified for CS1 remains almost constant if the size of analyzed area increases. The number of signals exceeding &#x02018;level 1&#x02019; in &#x000b1; 2 and &#x000b1; 5 bp area (11 and 24, respectively) corresponds to the expected values (11 and 26, respectively) if CS2 statistic is used but is twice larger than expected from <italic>p</italic>-value (&#x0003c;0.0038) calculated on the basis of CS1 scores (6 and 12). The rate of false positives given by CS2 statistic is, therefore, quite realistic. It assumes 0.63 probability for the presence of highly scoring position in the &#x000b1; 10 area around virtual TSPs of CS1 (total number of positions is 5733). One signal with <italic>S</italic> &#x0003e;7.44 (&#x02018;level 2&#x02019;) was really registered in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G).</p><p>Portion of positions with <italic>S</italic> exceeding &#x02018;level 2&#x02019; and the average <italic>S</italic> decrease upon widening of the analyzed area around real promoters, however, distribution of their scores does not reveal expected maxima typical for CS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E and F). Only in &#x000b1;10 region <italic>S</italic>-values show noticeable divergence. That means that PlatProm scores around real TSPs are higher than background values. Thus, the total number of positions with <italic>S</italic> &#x0003e;3.4 for &#x000b1;2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) than the total number of experimentally mapped starts including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination showed that &#x0223c;92% of additional signals are generated by PlatProm using the same frame for &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 hexanucleotides as position with maximal <italic>S</italic>. Remaining ones correspond to alternative &#x02212;10 element (4.4%) or &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs tend to have additional signals corresponding to alternative pair of core elements. Thus, in all cases PlatProm signals proximal to known TSPs denote the presence of either the same or alternative promoter and should not be considered as false positives.</p><p>Predicted TSPs were classified in respect to the borders of mapped genes considering 750 bp as the allowed distance between the predicted transcription starts and the coding sequences of downstream genes [&#x0223c;10% of known promoters are 250&#x02013;700 bp far from the coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>)]. Most predicted TSPs were ranked by this strategy as &#x02018;expected&#x02019; promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), although some of them fall into upstream genes (see, for instance P2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E).</p><p>Approximately 19% of the remaining TSPs were found on the opposite strand of coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes, but until now they were not considered typical for bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of evidence support our predictions:

Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing promoters with antisense orientation.</p><p>Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group have sense orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). About 23% of corresponding TSPs lie &#x0003c;50 bp downstream from the initiating codon. They were not considered as candidates for independent transcription initiation, since corresponding promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trapping near real promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Some intragenic promoters may intensify transcription of properly oriented downstream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still &#x0223c;400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destination. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most exotic assumption to date. At the same time, ORF Finder (NCBI) reveals alternative ORFs supplied with a suitable Shine-Dalgarno sequence downstream of &#x0223c;50% of intragenic co-directed promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>The genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> has promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; with high density of promoter-like signals</title><p><italic>In silico</italic> promoter mapping revealed 78 unusual genomic regions spanning for at least 300 bp and containing eight or more potential TSPs on any strand in the running window of 100 bp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B exemplifies this phenomenon. We call these regions &#x02018;promoter islands&#x02019; (PI) so as to distinguish them from clustered &#x02018;promoter-like signals&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) found in front of almost all (92%) genes of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). ChIP-on-chip assays registered complexes with RNAPol for all three PIs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 (D and E</xref>). However, transcription efficiency from <italic>appY</italic>-associated PI1 seemed to be much weaker than that from PI3, containing promoters for <italic>ompT</italic> and <italic>pauD</italic> and PI2 carrying out antisense transcription from <italic>ompT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). This curious observation prompted us to verify promoter activity within the <italic>appY</italic> genomic locus.</p><p>In perfect conformity with ChIP-on-chip data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D and E), the 406-bp DNA fragment, containing both the expected intergenic promoters and unusual intragenic promoter-like sites within <italic>appY</italic>, formed two major heparin-resistant complexes with RNAPol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Their relative abundance depended on enzyme:DNA ratio, supposing two or more sites for simultaneous interaction with the enzyme. Permanganate footprinting revealed four transcription bubbles, assuming formation of transcriptionally competent open complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Three of them lie &#x0223c;190 (I), &#x0223c;155 (II) and &#x0223c;90 bp (III) upstream from the <italic>appY</italic> ATG codon, and are suitable candidates for <italic>appY</italic> promoters, while the fourth one is located within the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Single round transcription assay performed with the same DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 2) testified synthesis of two major RNA-products: &#x0223c;305 and &#x0223c;237 nt. Two additional templates were used to ascribe them to particular transcription bubbles. The longer product may be initiated at either PII, or PIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). It remains unchanged when template shortened in the coding region was used (lane 3), while becomes &#x0223c;65 nt longer when DNA fragment elongated in opposite direction was taken for transcription assay (lane 1). Thus we conclude that &#x0223c;305 nt-RNA is initiated at PIV and is transcribed in antisense direction. Since the &#x0223c;237 nt-product, vice versa, remains unchanged when the longer DNA fragment is used but becomes shorter in the case of the shortened template, it can be transcribed only from PIII towards the coding sequence of <italic>appY</italic> and, therefore, may represent <italic>appY</italic>-mRNA. However, reverse transcription from total RNA failed to reveal the expected cDNAs in any of five experiments performed in different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E).

In the case of <italic>appY</italic> transcription depends on impediments buried in its coding sequence. Intragenic promoter-like sites certainly may play such a role. Genomic DNA of <italic>E. coli</italic>, therefore, contains several types of promoter-like sites with poorly understood function. ChIP-on-chip data were used to evaluate the ability of predicted promoters to bind RNAPol in the genome-wide scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Coordinates of predicted promoters overlap with RNAPol-binding sites found <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Three questions were addressed to compare <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data:

To answer the first question, we used the whole set of 30 188 predicted TSPs. They form 4810 clusters or single promoter-like sites separated from each other by at least 100 bp (overlapping clusters on opposite DNA strands were combined). Predicted TSPs or TSP clusters were considered as confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> data, if at least one positive chip probe was found by Reppas <italic>et al</italic>. [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); experiment B] within a &#x000b1; 100 bp surrounding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C illustrate scrutinized area). Ninety-four percent of individual TSPs (or 77% of promoter clusters) fall into genomic loci interacting with RNAPol <italic>in vivo</italic> or are located within the allowed distance. Thus, most predicted promoters of all types perform at least one promoter function.</p><p>To address the second question, we used the set of microarray probes efficiently hybridized with enzyme-trapped DNAs. A total of 51 922 probes show fluorescent signal at least 2-fold higher if RNAPol&#x02013;DNA complexes were extracted using specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). They represent 1209 continuous genomic regions. RNAPol residence sites observed <italic>in vivo</italic> were considered related to potential promoters if at least one TSP with <italic>S</italic> &#x0003e; 7.44 was found within region covered by oligonucleotide probes or in &#x000b1;100 bp surrounding area.

Since <italic>S</italic> reflects probability of any single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol binding to a particular genomic region represented by 50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern of <italic>S</italic> should be converted into a comparable mode. Converting procedure should take into account that the geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coincide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol <italic>in vivo</italic> interacts with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chip-hybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a particular probe may result from two types of complexes differing in enzyme orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Supposing each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymerase we thus considered the sum of <italic>S</italic> corresponding to the virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme binding (<italic>P</italic>):

Finally, PlatProm is currently attuned to &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-specific promoters, while &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-specific antibodies precipitate &#x003c3;<sup>28</sup> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Usage of &#x003b2;&#x02032;-specific antibodies in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all these realities, we conclude that both values of <bold>R</bold> are rather high.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; have unusual functional features</title><p>The shape of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A reveals 2106 outliers with lower than expected hybridization signals (red symbols), which can not be attributed to experimental or technical errors, since oligonucleotide probes to the same genomic regions in the other ChIP-on-chip data set also tend to weaker hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This phenomenon can not be also explained by repressor functioning since the percentage of probes representing genes with inhibited transcription (22%) among these outlying probes approximately equals the percentage (25%) of such genes in the genome [RegulonDB 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>)]. Further analysis showed that almost all out-of-ordered probes correspond to regions with multiple promoter-like sites and every one of 78 promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; turned out to be represented in the prominent part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. They comprise 32% of all the deviating probes, rather than 0.7% expected by chance. <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>R</sub> for promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; are low: 0.09 and 0.17, respectively. Thus, it appears that polymerase recognizes any single promoter-like site within the region of multiple competing promoters with less predictable efficiency than across the whole genome. High density of promoter-like sites tends to weaken rather than strengthen RNAPol binding.</p><p>To explore further this phenomenon a set of 181 known promoters accurately recognized <italic>in silico</italic> and possessing no more than two additional PlatProm signal(s) on either strand in a &#x000b1;50 bp area was compiled (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>). Amid others it contains promoters P<italic><sub>fadB</sub></italic>, P<italic><sub>cusC</sub></italic>, and P<italic><sub>cusR</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Only 21 promoters from this set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected by chance (&#x0223c;2%). The set of &#x02018;normal&#x02019; promoters was compared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and transcription efficiency calculated as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> legend (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</ext-link>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). All PIs and 87% of &#x02018;normal&#x02019; promoters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</ext-link>) form complexes with RNAPol. At the same time RNA synthesis has been detected for 107 &#x02018;normal&#x02019; promoters (59%) but only for 20 out of 156 (78 &#x000d7; 2) genomic loci flanking promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; (13%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C illustrates expression efficiency and RNAPol binding for two compared groups. Points representing promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; are mainly concentrated in the bottom part of the plot. The yield of particular RNAs in the cell may, therefore, depend on the presence of competing promoters, which makes genomic regions differing in abundance of transcription signals dissimilar in terms of functional characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Comprehensive annotation of newly sequenced genomes implying mapping of genes along with their regulatory elements is currently becoming a long-term strategy appealing for effective promoter-finders. In the case of genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in localization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out positions where sRNAs may be initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), whereas other programs classify potential products as putative sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and folding propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders may provide unique indicators of potential antisense transcription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have been found in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This rather small number apparently does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expression studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated from antisense strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>); PlatProm predicted many potential promoters for antisense transcription, while ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic RNAPol-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Even though many signals registered by microarrays may result from run-through transcripts unterminated at 3&#x02032;-ends of neighboring genes, some promoters predicted <italic>in silico</italic> may be false positives while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for antisense transcription in bacteria.</p><p>Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promoters with sense orientation and preferred location near the initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>)]. In the chromosome of <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes <italic>hokC</italic>, <italic>tpr</italic> and <italic>ygeN</italic> with 5&#x02032;-ends mapped within <italic>mokC</italic>, <italic>rttR</italic> and <italic>ygeO</italic>, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) may be also initiated from their own promoters predicted by PlatProm. Internal promoters with sense orientation may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription.</p><p>The data obtained drew attention to 78 regions with high density of TSPs over long distance. Fifty-five of them at least partly overlap with intergenic loci presumed to contain active promoters, nine of which are mapped experimentally. They initiate RNA synthesis from single or several (up to eight) positions. Multiplicity of the TSPs might, therefore, be exploited by transcription machinery. Four promoter-rich clusters lie between convergently transcribed genes like in the case of <italic>appY</italic>/<italic>ompT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Their transcription activity, if detected, assumes either presence of yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions or antisense transcription in one or both directions. Putative sRNA IS021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), for instance, may be synthesized between <italic>appY</italic> and <italic>ompT</italic>, while gene for sRNA HB_171 is predicted between <italic>ygcE</italic> and <italic>ygcF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The most interesting are the remaining 19 PIs either immersed into one coding sequence or covering the junction point between two operonic genes, where promoter activity is not required.</p><p>Even though all 78 promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; bind RNAPol <italic>in vivo</italic>, transcription has been detected for only 13 genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). In all but one case (PI submerged into the <italic>wbbK</italic> coding sequence) they occupy intergenic regions. PI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) exemplifies cluster with weak expression observed in only one experiment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). Our data show that RNAPol can interact with PI1 and initiate RNA synthesis in both directions <italic>in vitro</italic> but primer extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E) failed to reveal the presence of <italic>appY</italic>-mRNA among RNAs produced <italic>in vivo</italic>. This transcriptional silence makes the value of <italic>R</italic> between promoter scores within PIs and corresponding (log<sub>2</sub>)<sub>E</sub> statistically insignificant, whereas faint correlation between these parameters was registered for the subset of &#x02018;normal&#x02019; promoters (0.16) and even the whole set of predicted promoter-like regions (0.075). That means that the overall transcription from multiple TSPs does not represent the sum of expected outputs from individual ones. Some sites seem to bind RNAPol without initiating productive synthesis, thus performing only part of functions commonly ascribed to promoter regions. If so, they may be considered as a kind of suppressor elements.</p><p>Currently it is not clear whether promoter &#x02018;islands&#x02019; found in this study and &#x02018;clusters with high density of promoter-like signals&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) reflect one and the same phenomenon. Previously discovered clusters are defined as accessories of intergenic loci, surrounding functional promoters and participating in their proper regulation, while 23 PIs (&#x0223c;30%) are located far from expected promoters. Ninety-two percent of <italic>E. coli</italic> genes have promoters surrounded by other promoter-like signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This clustering, thus, should be considered as a feature typical for <italic>E. coli</italic> genes, while &#x02018;single&#x02019; promoters should be ranked as a peculiarity. At the same time only 78 regions have extremely high density of potential TSPs assuming their special role in genome organization and function. Since DNA of all but three PIs has high potentiality to undergo stress-induced deformations [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/benham/sidd_database/">http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/benham/sidd_database/</ext-link>], there is a reason to suggest a possibility that PIs participate in structural remodeling of bacterial chromosome.</p><p>Our conclusions were drawn on the basis of comparative analysis of data sets obtained <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although both methods have certain limitations if used separately, together they provide valid information on the genome positioning of RNAPol-binding sites and allow spotting a larger set of potential promoters. Thus, even weak binding signals associated with a predicted TSP may indicate the presence of an active promoter, whereas complex formation with the enzyme nearby low scoring promoters supports their functionality. Moreover, the combined use of two approaches allows mapping of all types of transcribed regions including those encoding untranslated RNA species, hardly identifiable by other computational screens.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp490/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Russian Foundation for Basic Research (07-04-01066).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
