Tanushimaru is a rural farming community located in southwestern Japan. Although the Seven Countries Study ended in 1989, we continued the epidemiologic study in the same district. As previously reported, the demographic backgrounds of the subjects in this area are similar to those of the Japanese general population.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> During the past 6 decades, lifestyle and eating patterns have been dramatically changes, associated with socioeconomic development,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> which may affect atherosclerosis development.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>In atherosclerosis progression, inflammation, and immune responses are involved in all layers of the arterial wall,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> which can cause abnormal vasospastic responses.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> In such situation, arterial stiffness has been a good marker to detect the early stages of atherosclerosis, which is also able to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) events to a larger extent than brachial pulse pressure (PP), not only because it directly influences left ventricular afterload and coronary perfusion, but also because it may partially parallel the extent of coronary atherosclerosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Arterial stiffness can be noninvasively assessed by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), a simple and reproducible method.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Different aspects of large artery stiffness at rest in relation to ischemic threshold have been assessed using arterial compliance, distensibility index, and augmentation index (AI).<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>Cigarette smoking is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular diseases acting via oxidative stress,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> in which it has been demonstrated that smoking increases arterial stiffness, independent of blood pressure (BP).<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, smoking cessation more than a decade has been reported to recover arterial stiffness parameters to nonsignificant levels,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> because smoking cessation reduces the levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> However, no study has focused on the effects of dose-dependency of current smoking, including smoking cessation, on arterial stiffness using AI in a general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether radial AI is associated with smoking habits in a Japanese general population in Tanushimaru Study.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 1943 subjects (774 males and 1169 females; aged 40&#x02013;95 years) were enrolled in this study in Tanushimaru, a typical farming town, where we have conducted a periodic epidemiological survey in 2009, and performed cross-sectional analysis. The respondents accounted for 48.2% of the men and 62.0% of the women in Tanushimaru who were older than 40 years of age (total target population: 3463).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Data collection</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; medical history, use of alcohol, and smoking were ascertained by a questionnaire. Alcohol intake was classified as current habitual use or not. We also obtained the data of medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, and history of CAD. Daily cigarette consumption in males was expressed 4 categories such as nonsmoker (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;225), former smoker (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;346), current smoking of 1 to 19 cigarettes per day (light smoker, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;89), and 20 or more (heavy smoker, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;109). Daily cigarette consumption in females was expressed 4 categories such as nonsmoker (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1104), former smoker (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19), current smoking of 1 to 19 cigarettes per day (light smoker, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24), and 20 or more (heavy smoker, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10). The nonsmokers were defined as no past or current history of smoking, the former smokers as smoking cessation before the examination, and the current smokers as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (square meters) as an index of obesity. BP was measured in the supine position twice at 3-minute intervals using an upright standard sphygmomanometer. Vigorous physical activity and smoking were avoided for at least 30&#x0200a;minutes before BP measurement. The second BP with the fifth-phase diastolic pressure was used for analysis.</p><p>Blood was drawn from the antecubital vein for determinations of lipids profiles (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c] and triglycerides), uric acid and glycosylated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> [HbA<sub>1c</sub> (Japan Diabetes Society)]. Fasting blood samples were centrifuged within 1&#x0200a;hour after collection.

The BP was determined in the right upper arm using an oscillometric method (HEM-900AI; Omron Healthcare Co.

The Ukiha and Tanushimaru Branches of the Japan Medical Association, by the local citizens&#x02019; committee of Tanushimaru, and by the Research Ethics Committee of the Kurume University School of Medicine (Process numbers 9019/2009) approved the study in conformity with the principles embodied in the declaration of Helsinki. All participants were informed about research procedures and risks before signing an informed consent.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Because of skewed distributions, the natural logarithmic (ln) transformations were performed for triglycerides.

Otsuka et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> have shown the significant inverse association of radial AI with BMI using a multivariate analysis. However, the mechanisms and pathophysiology relating AI and BMI are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>AI levels and smoking habits</title><p>Recently, smoking in men has been more common in Asia than in the United Kingdom and United State of America, which is opposite in women.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Smoking rates in men were 25.8% and those in women were 2.8% in the present study. In this background, our data indicated that AI levels were significantly associated with smoking habits in a dose-dependent manner. Correlations between AI levels and smoking status were found in Japanese and European investigations,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> which are consistent with our study. Although the mechanisms are not still clear, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress may play important roles in the relationship between AI and cigarette smoking.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Further, the present study indicated a clear dose&#x02013;response relationship between AI and smoking status in males, in which AI might be increased as a marker of smoking-specific oxidative stress.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Although AI levels in former smokers (81.3%) were slightly elevated than those in nonsmokers (81.2%) in this study, former smokers showed an almost normal range of AI levels. By contrast, AI levels between light and heavy smokers seemed to be comparable, suggesting that smoking cessation, but not cutting down, may be favorable to the reduction of oxidative stress, as previously reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup></p><p>As for medications, there is no significant relationship between AI and medications for dyslipidemia and diabetes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Because of the strong association of AI with medication for hypertension in males, we analyzed the data after adjustment for the factor in addition to the confounding factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). However, the significance still remained.</p><p>The significant dose&#x02013;response relationship in females between AI and 4 categories of smoking habits was not observed. These results may be caused by a small number of smoking habits in former and current smokers in females.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in our study. First, the study design was a cross-sectional. Thus, nothing conclusive for the association of AI and smoking habits can be stated. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the role of AI in smokers, especially in the aspects of mortality or cardiovascular events. Second, from the multiple correlation coefficients, the significant 6 factors (as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>) explained only 5.0% of the variation of AI. Third, we obtained the number of cigarettes by questionnaires, which might not be quantitatively accurate. Moreover, we do not have the detailed data regarding smoking duration. Forth, because the survey conducted in 2009, the data are little old. Finally, although medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were not correlated with AI levels in our analyses, we were not able to exclude the contributions of some therapeutic agents.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that AI levels were significantly associated with smoking habits in males Japanese.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to members of the Japan Medical Association of Ukiha, the elected officials and residents of Tanushimaru, and the team of physicians for their help in carrying out the health examinations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AI = augmentation index, BMI = body mass index, BP = blood pressure, BUN = blood urea nitrogen, CAD = coronary artery disease, DL = dyslipidemic, DM = diabetes mellitus, eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate, FPG = fasting plasma glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> = glycosylated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, HDL-c = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HT = hypertensive, LDL-c = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, PP = pulse pressure, PWV = pulse wave velocity.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keys</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Aravanis</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackburn</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
