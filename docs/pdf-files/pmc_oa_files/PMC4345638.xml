This process has been known to play pivotal roles in the number of biological events including apoptosis, cell signaling, transcription and translation. Although the process of ubiquitination has been studied extensively, the mechanism of polyubiquitination by multi protein E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF complex remains elusive. In the present study, we identified UbcH5a as a novel stimulating factor for poly-ubiquitination catalyzed by SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> using biochemical fractionations and MALDI-TOF. Moreover, we showed that recombinant UbcH5a and Cdc34 synergistically stimulate SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> catalyzed polyubiquitination <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data may provide an important cue to understand the mechanism how the SCF complex efficiently polyubiquitinates target substrates.

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification process that consists of consecutive enzymatic steps. First, ubiquitin is activated by E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), resulting in a thioester linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and the E1 cysteine residue <xref rid="B001" ref-type="bibr">(1)</xref>. This process requires ATP as an energy source. Then, activated ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to the active site cysteine residue of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) <xref rid="B002" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>. At the final step, ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) recognizes the substrate for ubiquitination and mediates the specific interaction with E2 and substrate. By doing so, the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin is attached on a lysine residue of the target protein which is mediated by E3 <xref rid="B001" ref-type="bibr">(1</xref>-<xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref>. In general, polyubiquitinated target proteins are captured and degraded by the proteasome <xref rid="B004" ref-type="bibr">(4)</xref>. In most organisms, E1, E2 and E3 enzymes exist in a hierarchical way. A single E1 enzyme activates ubiquitin for the entire array of downstream conjugating enzyme <xref rid="B001" ref-type="bibr">(1</xref>, <xref rid="B002" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref>. All E2s share a conserved core domain consisting of about 150 amino acids. Despite their similarity to one other, different E2s execute distinct biological functions and the reflection of the specificity of E2 may be derived from the specific interaction with E3 <xref rid="B002" ref-type="bibr">(2</xref>, <xref rid="B003" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref>. Ubiquitination has been demonstrated to be involved in almost all biological processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation <xref rid="B005" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>.</p><p>Human F-box helicase 1 (hFBH1) is an F-box containing DNA helicase. It has been shown to act as DNA helicase and E3 ubiquitin ligase along with Skp1, Cul1 and Roc1, making an SCF complex <xref rid="B006" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref>. In the SCF complex, the interchangeable F-box protein governs the substrate specificity through physical interaction with target substrates. The best characterized F-box proteins are &#x003b2;-TRCP and SKP2. Both of them play roles in the recognition and degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and p27 respectively <xref rid="B007" ref-type="bibr">(7</xref>, <xref rid="B008" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. Recently, it has been reported that hFBH1 is required for the apoptosis induced by DNA damage in response to DNA replication stress and that the level of hFBH1 is regulated by its own F-box domain, indicating hFBH1 ubiquitinates itself <xref rid="B009" ref-type="bibr">(9</xref>, <xref rid="B010" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. However, the target substrates for SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> and its mechanism of actions remain elusive.</p><p>In the present study, we identified UbcH5a as a stimulating factor for SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> mediated polyubiquitination using biochemical fractionation followed by MALDI-TOF.

It has been previously demonstrated that polyubiquitin is formed in the presence of E1, E2, ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) and ATP even in the absence of specific substrates for ubiquitination <xref rid="B011" ref-type="bibr">(11)</xref>. Since hFBH1 is mainly localized in the nucleus, we assumed that the potential substrate would be also localized in the nucleus. Thus, using HeLa nuclear extract, the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay was performed. Surprisingly, HeLa nuclear extract stimulated the formation of polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>A), compared with the reaction without nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>A, lane 7 and lane 8). When either E2 or E3 was omitted, the polyubiquitin chain was not formed (lanes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6), indicating that the polyubiquitin chain formation is dependent on both E2 and E3. Noting that the reaction without E1 produced the polyubiquitin chains as much as the reaction with E1, we suggest that HeLa nuclear extracts contained sufficient E1 enzyme to produce polyubiquitin chains. Next, we decided to purify protein responsible for this stimulation by biochemical fractionations. Starting with HeLa nuclear extracts, we performed consecutive purifications by following the stimulating activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>B). Using biochemical assay with fractions from Sephadex 75, the stimulating activity peaked in fraction number 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>C). Thus, in order to pinpoint this protein, fractions from Sephadex 75 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>D). Comparing the stimulating activity and protein bands in SDS-PAGE, the stimulating activity was coincident with about 18KDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>D).</p><fig id="F001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><title>Purification of a stimulating factor for SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> catalyzed polyubiquitination from HeLa nuclear extracts.

Two peptides (IYH PNINSNGSICLDILR and VLLSICSLLCDPNPDDPLVPDIAQIYK) corresponding to UbcH5a were determined. UbcH5 belongs to an evolutionally conserved subfamily of E2s involved in the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor p53 and hypoxia inducible transcription factor, HIF1&#x003b1; <xref rid="B012" ref-type="bibr">(12</xref>, <xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref>. In mammals, there are 3 UbcH5 isotypes; UbcH5a, UbcH5b and UbcH5c, sharing a highly homology of amino acid sequences (the identity of UbcH5a and UbcH5b; 89%, the identity of UbcH5a and UbcH5c; 88% and the identity of UbcH5b and UbcH5c; 97%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F002">Fig. 2</xref>A). We then wondered whether UbcH5a as well as UbcH5b and UbcH5c can stimulate SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> mediating the formation of polyubiquitin chains. To this end, recombinant UbcH5a, UbcH5b and UbcH5c were purified using <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system.

To test this, an increasing amount of either Cdc34, UbcH5a, UbcH5b or UbcH5c was incubated with ubiquitin, E1, and SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> in the presence of ATP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F003">Fig. 3</xref>A, UbcH5a and UbcH5c promoted SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> catalyzed polyubiquitination less efficiently when compared to Cdc34, suggesting that UbcH5a and UbcH5c can act as E2 for SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup>. Although there are only 4 amino acids difference between UbcH5b and UbcH5c, UbcH5b did not promote the polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F003">Fig. 3</xref>A, lanes 12-15). Note that different E2 showed different patterns of mono- and di-ubiquitination. As UbcH5a initially was identified as a stimulating factor for SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> catalyzed polyubiquitination, we tested whether UbcH5s could stimulate the polyubiquitination or not. For this purpose, purified UbcH5a, UbcH5b or UbcH5c was additionally added to the reaction containing Ubiquitin, E1, Cdc34 and SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup>. When increasing amounts of UbcH5a or UbcH5c were added, more polyubiquitin chains were formed compared with the reaction with either the same amounts of UbcH5 or Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F003">Fig. 3</xref>B, lanes 2-8 and lanes 14-18). However, similar to the previous result, UbcH5b did not show a stimulating activity even in the presence of Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F003">Fig. 3</xref>B, lanes 9-13). It should be noted that the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains was totally dependent on SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup>.</p><fig id="F003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><title>The formation of ubiquitin polymers by SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> was catalyzed by either UbcH5a or UbcH5c but not by UbcH5b.

Since we did not observe any differences between UbcH5a and UbcH5c, UbcH5a was tested. The rate of poly-ubiquitin chain formation by UbcH5a was slow with a lag period, whereas that by Cdc34 was rapid and saturated at 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">Fig. 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">4</xref>B). When UbcH5a and Cdc34 were both added, the poly-ubiquitin formation proceeded with a short lag period (less than 2 minutes), and was still actively catalyzed at 60 minutes. The levels of ubiquitin polymers produced by both UbcH5a and cdc34 were significantly increased, implying that UbcH5a and cdc34 synergistically act on the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">Fig. 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">4</xref>B). There is a literature describing that UbcH5a catalyzes non K48-linked poly-ubiquitination together with HECT E3 <xref rid="B014" ref-type="bibr">(14)</xref>. Therefore, the question was raised if synergistically catalyzed ubiquitin polymers could be non K48-linked polyubiquitination. To test this possibility, the time course experiment was performed using mutant Ubiquitin where lysine 48 was mutated to arginine (K48R mutant). As a result, the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains was greatly reduced with the use of K48R Ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">Fig. 4</xref>C), even though UbcH5 and cdc34 were charged by K48R Ubiquitin. This result suggests that ubiquitin polymers synergistically produced by UbcH5a and cdc34 are lysine 48 linked poly-ubiquitination. Interestingly, our results somewhat support a previous report that a single ubiquitin is initially rapidly transferred by UbcH5 to I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and then Cdc34 catalyzes SCF<sup>&#x003b2;TrCp2</sup> catalyzed poly-ubiquitination of IKB&#x003b1; <xref rid="B015" ref-type="bibr">(15)</xref>. Ryu and his colleagues showed E2 dependent target specificity and processivity of p27 ubiquitination <xref rid="B016" ref-type="bibr">(16)</xref>. The difference between previous reports and our results may be caused by the window we observed here that the formation of polyubiquitin chains was neither mono- nor di-ubiquitination. In addition, we utilized an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted system to examine the SCF catalyzed polyubiquitination. Considering the amino acid sequences and the structural similarity of UbcH5s, the other interesting finding was that UbcH5a and UbcH5c can stimulate polyubiquitination but UbcH5b did not. It would be intriguing to know if UbcH5b/c chimeric mutant were generated and examined to stimulate polyubiquitin formation or not. This iterative mutation experiments could render which amino acid is critical to differentiate the specificity among UbcH5a, b and c. In summary, we present the synergistic effect of two E2 enzymes in the formation of polyubiquitin chains. These results may provide a mechanistic cue to understand the process of SCF catalyzed polyubiquitination.</p><fig id="F004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><title>UbcH5a stimulates SCF<sup>hFBH1</sup> mediated polyubiquitination.
