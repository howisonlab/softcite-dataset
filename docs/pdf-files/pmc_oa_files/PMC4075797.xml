controversial. There is currently no consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment
for unresectable CD. We report the case of a patient with CD and demonstrate the
efficacy of radiation therapy as a treatment modality for CD.</p><p>In May of 2007, a married, 33-year-old white male driver was referred to our thoracic
surgery outpatient clinic from a primary health care clinic in the city of Mar&#x000ed;lia,
Brazil. The patient presented with a 4-month history of dyspnea at rest (unrelated to
exertion) and of anterior and posterior chest pain (burning pain). He reported dry cough
and asthenia in the past few weeks. In addition, the patient reported no hoarseness,
hemoptysis, nodules, or weight loss. He also reported no comorbidities other than
moderate obesity (body mass index = 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), as well as having reported no
history of smoking, alcoholism, or illicit drug use.</p><p>Physical examination revealed good general health, as well as having revealed no
cervical or supraclavicular lymph node enlargement. There were no cardiopulmonary or
abdominal abnormalities.</p><p>The patient was admitted for further investigation. A CT scan of the chest revealed a
left perihilar mass of 68 &#x000d7; 52 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>) in the lower lobe, as well as mediastinal lymph node enlargement in the
anterior paratracheal and left hilar regions. Laboratory test results were normal.</p><p>
<fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Chest CT scan showing a left perihilar mass.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1806-3713-jbpneu-39-01-00116-gf01"/></fig>
</p><p>In July of 2007, the patient was referred for left lobectomy. However, it was impossible
to resect the nodule, because it was in contact with the left main bronchus. Therefore,
a biopsy of the nodule was the only procedure performed. The biopsy showed a lesion
consisting of large lymphoid follicles, which in turn consisted of small lymphocytes.
There was concentric proliferation of endothelial cells in the central portion of the
lesion, and the vascular lumen contained erythrocytes. These findings confirmed the
diagnosis of CD.</p><p>Because CD is a lymphoproliferative disease of indeterminate behavior, a decision was
made to treat the patient as an outpatient, follow-up evaluations being performed every
6 months at our thoracic surgery, oncology, and hematology outpatient clinic and chest
CT scans being taken during the follow-up period. A CT scan of the chest showed a slight
increase in lesion size (72 &#x000d7; 55 mm), the lesion having no clear cleavage plane with the
left descending pulmonary artery and being therefore deemed unresectable. Therefore, in
August of 2009, the patient was referred to the radiation therapy department for
evaluation. Between October 5, 2009 and November 16, 2009, the patient underwent
three-dimensional radiation therapy at a total dose of 40 Gy, delivered in 20 fractions
by a 6-MV linear accelerator. In addition to the tumor mass, the affected pulmonary
hilar, subcarinal, and paratracheal lymph nodes were included in the radiation therapy
fields. After the radiation therapy, the patient reported for follow-up evaluation every
3-4 months, a chest CT scan showing an approximately 25% decrease in mass size (55 &#x000d7; 45
mm) in comparison with that seen on the chest CT scan taken at the beginning of the
treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). At this writing, the patient
was in good general health, his dry cough, asthenia, and chest pain having improved. His
dyspnea also improved, although only relatively. After a 3-year follow-up period,
echocardiography, electrocardiography, and gallium-67 scintigraphy results were normal,
whereas spirometry results showed moderate restrictive lung disease, which was
consistent with the degree of obesity.</p><p>

</p><p>It is known that CD is a rare cause of pathological proliferation of lymphoid tissue.
The etiology of CD remains unknown. The disease can affect individuals of all ages.
Unicentric CD occurs most frequently in adolescents and young adults, whereas
multicentric CD occurs most frequently in the elderly<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> and in patients with
immunodeficiency, particularly AIDS.</p><p>Although it is generally benign, CD can behave like a malignant disease.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>
Clinically, the release of cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-6) can lead to systemic
manifestations of CD. Patients can present with fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly,
polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. A biopsy
is required for a definitive diagnosis. However, because the pathological features of CD
are similar to those of some thymomas and lymphomas, immunohistochemical studies might
be needed in order to confirm the diagnosis of CD.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> Of all known variants
of CD, the hyaline-vascular variant appears to be the most sensitive to radiation
therapy.</p><p>Because of the diversity of clinical situations and the difficulty in defining the
therapeutic response retrospectively, the standard treatment has yet to be
established.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> In patients with multicentric CD, reducing the amount of
involved tissue through surgery or radiation therapy can aid in reducing signs and
symptoms,<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>4<sup>)</sup> the treatment of multicentric CD being based on chemotherapy,
corticosteroid therapy, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> In
cases of unicentric CD, the treatment of choice is surgical excision, the recurrence
rate being low. Studies have confirmed that patients with CD can be successfully treated
with radiation therapy.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>
</p><p>Radiation therapy can avoid the need for overly aggressive therapy and has been
successfully used in patients who have unresectable lesions or who cannot undergo
surgery because of the presence of comorbidities.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup> Radiation therapy at
doses of 2,700-4,500 cGy can result in disease remission in isolated cases, especially
in patients with unicentric CD. In addition, radiation therapy can produce favorable
responses, including relief of systemic symptoms and a reduction in the size of the
mass.<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup> One group of authors<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> summarized the findings in 32
CD patients undergoing radiation therapy, including those in 29 patients with unicentric
CD. In those 29 patients, the overall response rate was 89.6%, the complete remission
rate being 44.8% and the partial remission rate being 44.8%; the authors concluded that,
in most cases, radiation therapy (at a dose of 40-50 Gy) can achieve complete or partial
remission of the disease.<sup>(</sup>
