Satellite cell self-renewal is essential for long-term tissue homeostasis, and previous work has identified a number of external cues that control this process. However, little is known of the possible intrinsic control mechanisms of satellite cell self-renewal. Here, we show that quiescent satellite cells harbor a primary cilium, which is rapidly disassembled upon entry into the cell cycle. Contrasting with a commonly accepted belief, cilia reassembly does not occur uniformly in cells exiting the cell cycle. We found that primary cilia reassemble preferentially in cells committed to self-renew, and disruption of cilia reassembly causes a specific deficit in self-renewing satellite cells.

Reserve satellite cells can be produced from activated SCs via one of two mechanisms: symmetric cell division, which generates two identical daughter stem cells, and asymmetric cell division, which generates two daughter cells with distinct fates (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Under normal demand, reserve cells are primarily produced via asymmetric cell division, whereas under extreme circumstances they are produced via symmetric cell division. Understanding the cues and molecular mechanisms that regulate satellite cell self-renewal is critical, as disruption in the balance that controls the number of muscle progenitor cells and reserve cells has profound consequences for the regenerative capability of skeletal muscles and underpins the reduced muscle mass (sarcopenia) in aged muscles (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chakkalakal et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Conboy and Rando, 2005</xref>).</p><p>SC self-renewal through symmetric cell division occurs mostly in the planar orientation (parallel to the fiber) and involves the planar cell polarity pathway (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Le Grand et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, asymmetric SC cell division occurs primarily along the apicobasal axis and generates a self-renewing daughter cell associated with the basal lamina that covers the muscle fiber and a differentiating daughter cell that faces the sarcolemma (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kuang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Both intrinsic and extrinsic cues regulate SC asymmetric cell division. However, while an important focus has been placed on extrinsic factors controlling SC asymmetric cell division (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Conboy and Rando, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Urciuolo et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), intrinsic cues have only begun to be elucidated. These include the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic and nuclear fate determinants (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gopinath et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Le Grand et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shea et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) and/or the asymmetric inheritance of template DNA (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Rocheteau et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shinin et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Both mechanisms rely on the polarity of dividing SCs, which is established by the activity of the PAR complex and influences the orientation of mitotic spindles (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Troy et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Fuchs, 2013</xref>). Centrosomes play a key role in this process as microtubule organizing centers, and previous studies have reported that the asymmetric segregation of the mother and daughter centrioles during mitotic spindle formation confers differential cell-fate cues (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>). The mother centriole acts also as a nucleating center for the formation of primary cilia, a cellular organelle anchored in the cytoplasm through a basal body composed of the mother centriole and protruding outside the cell through a microtubule-containing appendage (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Given these facts, we asked whether primary cilia play a role in SC self-renewal.</p><p>Here, we show that quiescent SCs contain a primary cilium, which disassembles upon SC activation and entry into the cell cycle. Upon exit from the cell cycle, primary cilia reassemble at the surface of a minority of SCs, which are fated to self-renew. Disruption of cilia reassembly following cell division drives muscle progenitor cells toward differentiation, at the expense of self-renewal. Thus, our work demonstrates that the primary cilium is an intrinsic cue that determines the self-renewal fate in SCs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Primary Cilia Are Predominantly Observed at the Surface of Quiescent Satellite Cells</title><p>Skeletal muscle fibers extracted from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of C57BL/6 mice were cultured for 96&#x000a0;hr. Under these conditions, SCs are in their native environment and are immunodetected with antibodies against caveolin-1 (CAV-1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Using antibodies directed against ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13b (ARL13B), a small guanosine triphosphatase specific to the ciliary membrane, we observed the presence of primary cilia in 67% of SCs from freshly isolated myofibers (T0, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). Primary cilia were also labeled by acetylated &#x003b1;-TUBULIN (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A). Transmission electron microscopy of myofibers cultured for 72&#x000a0;hr (T72) confirmed that the structure labeled with ARL13B and acetylated &#x003b1;-TUBULIN has a 9&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0 configuration consistent with a primary cilium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). The average length of cilia on quiescent SCs was 2.74&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (n&#x000a0;= 20; SD&#x000a0;= 0.23), a length similar to that of 10T1/2 fibroblasts (2.86&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bershteyn et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Within 24&#x000a0;hr (T24), when SCs exit quiescence, become activated, and express MYF5, only a small proportion of SCs exhibited cilia (9.9%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). Cilia numbers continued to decrease in 48-hr culture (T48) SCs, which express MYOD and proliferate to yield transit-amplifying cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). However, at 72&#x000a0;hr (T72) when satellite cells either downregulate PAX7 and activate MYOGENIN to differentiate, or maintain PAX7 and return to quiescence to self-renew, we observed that cilia reappeared in about 17% of SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). We examined myofibers at 96&#x000a0;hr (T96) to test whether additional primary cilia were generated (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Stearns, 2009</xref>). We noticed no significant increase in the percentage of ARL13B-positive SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). Thus, the small proportion of SCs harboring a primary cilium at T72 and T96 defined a specific cell population.</p><p>We next asked whether primary cilia were present at the surface of SCs in&#x000a0;vivo. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of <italic>Tg(Pax7-GFP)</italic> mice, which express GFP under the control of the SC-specific <italic>Pax7</italic> promoter, was injured by cardiotoxin injection and muscle regeneration monitored at 1, 2, 4, and 7&#x000a0;days post injury. Primary cilia were detected at the surface of quiescent SCs in non-injured muscles, but not in activated SCs at 1&#x000a0;day post injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). Cilia reassembly initiated in muscles at 2&#x000a0;days post injury and continued until 7&#x000a0;days post injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). Therefore, primary cilia are predominantly associated with quiescent SCs and dissociate at the onset of muscle injury in activated SCs, but reassemble in a subset of Pax7-expressing cells as muscles repair (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). As ARL13B and MYF5, a marker of activated SCs, were mutually exclusive in freshly isolated and in T24 SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>F and 1G), we performed a time-course analysis of primary cilia disassembly. This showed that primary cilia dissociation initiates as early as 4&#x000a0;hr after plating myofibers, and by 12&#x000a0;hr primary cilia are fully resorbed (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). Strangely, at T48 a small proportion of MYOD<sup>+</sup> SCs possessed a primary cilium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>G). However, a detailed time-course analysis of primary cilium dynamics between T48 and T72 confirmed that the co-detection of MYOD and primary cilium was transient and that by 60&#x000a0;hr of culture MYOD and ARL13B are mutually exclusive in SCs (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C). We also observe that by 72&#x000a0;hr in culture, the only ARL13B<sup>+</sup> SCs present were MYOD<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and MYOGENIN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>F and 1G), suggesting that the reassembly of primary cilia post cell division occurs in self-renewing SCs. Thus, primary cilia are regulated in a highly dynamic manner during adult myogenesis with a rapid dissociation within a few hours after SC activation and the subsequent reassembly in a subset of SCs that appear fated to self-renew (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>H).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Cell-Cycle Entry Initiates Primary Cilia Disassembly in Satellite Cells</title><p>The kinetics of primary cilium distribution during myogenesis suggests a mutually exclusive relationship between cilia and cell cycle. Myoblast cell-cycle progression through G1/S transition is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Saab et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we treated cultured myofibers with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, which blocked SCs in G1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A&#x02013;2C). Cell-cycle arrest was accompanied with the maintenance of primary cilia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). When CDK4/6 inhibition was reversed and SCs allowed to re-enter the cell cycle, primary cilia disassembled by 72&#x000a0;hr (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D&#x02013;2F), reinforcing our conclusion that primary cilium turnover in cultured myofibers is directly linked to and mutually exclusive with SC entry into the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Primary Cilia Are Preferentially Associated with Satellite Cells Engaged in Self-Renewal</title><p>Given that primary cilia are resorbed in dividing SCs and&#x000a0;not detected in activated (MYF5<sup>+</sup>) or differentiating (MYOGENIN<sup>+</sup>) cells, we reasoned that primary cilia may be associated with self-renewing SCs. We thus analyzed the distribution and plan of division of cilia-bearing cells at T48 and T72. At T48, the majority of cell doublets analyzed (79.8%) do not harbor a primary cilium. Of the remaining doublets presenting cilia (20.2%), 26% of doublets displayed an asymmetric distribution of their primary cilia with no bias for the division plan. The remaining doublets with a symmetrical distribution of cilia were mainly undergoing planar cell division (65.5%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). At T72, about half of cell doublets were associated with at least one primary cilium, which were largely distributed asymmetrically (96% of ARL13B<sup>+</sup> doublets) either in planar cell&#x000a0;division (34% of ARL13B<sup>+</sup>doublets) or in apicobasal cell division (62% of ARL13B<sup>+</sup>doublets) events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). Furthermore, the primary cilium was invariably observed in the daughter cell associated with the basal lamina in cell divisions with an apicobasal orientation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). Thus, when SCs are proliferating to produce transit-amplifying cells (at T48), primary cilia are mainly distributed symmetrically and are associated with both planar and apicobasal cell-division events. By T72 when a subset of progenitor cells commit to self-renewal, primary cilia become asymmetrically distributed and are mainly associated with apicobasal cell-division events. Given that self-renewing SCs downregulate MYOD, fail to activate MYOGENIN, and instead maintain PAX7 expression, we first examined whether the asymmetric distribution of primary cilia at T72 correlated with a self-renewing cell fate. Consistent with our observations that MYOD-expressing and MYOGENIN-expressing cells did not harbor a primary cilium at T72 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>F and 1G), we found that ARL13B co-localized with approximately 15% of GFP-positive cells and was mutually exclusive with MYOGENIN in T72 myofiber cultures from <italic>Tg(Pax7-GFP)</italic> muscles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). Furthermore, the analysis of the distribution of primary cilia (ARL13B<sup>+</sup>) in ciliated doublets at T72 revealed that primary cilia were mainly asymmetrically allocated to self-renewing cells or cells deemed to self-renew (PAX7/GFP<sup>+</sup>MYOGENIN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) following apicobasal cell division (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>E). Together, our observations suggest that the reassembly of primary cilia after cell division occurs preferentially in daughter cells that underwent asymmetric cell division and are fated to self-renew.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Disruption of Cilia Reassembly Impairs Satellite Cell Self-Renewal</title><p>We next asked whether cilia reassembly following SC asymmetric cell division was essential for SC self-renewal. Myofibers cultured for 66&#x000a0;hr to allow for cell division were treated with nocodazole or taxol, which affect cilia by destabilizing microtubule or by altering the levels of soluble tubulin, respectively (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), or with forchlorfenuron (FCF), an inhibitor of Septins, a family of proteins that regulate cilia length and stability (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), and cultured for a further 6&#x000a0;hr before analysis at T72 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). At T72, nocodazole or taxol treatment caused 100% inhibition, whereas FCF caused 58% inhibition of cilia reassembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). The proportion of 5-ethynyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled SCs was similar between nocodazole or FCF-treated cultures and control (DMSO-treated) cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C), confirming that a short treatment has little or no impact on the cell cycle. However, nocodazole, taxol, and FCF treatment caused a decrease in the number of PAX7<sup>+</sup>MYOGENIN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>M-CADHERIN<sup>+</sup> SCs, which labels self-renewing cells, and a concomitant increase in the number of Pax7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>MYOGENIN<sup>+</sup>M-CADHERIN<sup>+</sup> SCs, which labels differentiating cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and 4E). Consistent with the partial loss of primary cilia upon FCF treatment, a somewhat lesser effect on self-renewing SCs was observed in FCF-treated myofibers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E). Thus, blocking primary cilium reassembly following cell division disrupts the balance between differentiation and self-renewal, and impairs SC self-renewal at the expense of differentiation. This suggests that the selective reassembly of a primary cilium at the surface of one daughter cell, following asymmetric cell division, allocates SCs to a self-renewing cell fate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary cilium is a microtubule-containing cellular protrusion, which is anchored to a basal body constituted of a mother centriole acting as a microtubule organizing center during ciliogenesis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is widely accepted that primary cilia must dissociate prior to mitosis to release the centrioles for their subsequent enrolment in mitotic spindle formation and that primary cilia reassemble following cell division (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>). Here, we showed that quiescent SCs harbor a primary cilium, which resorbs rapidly upon SC activation and entry into the cell cycle, before reassembling asymmetrically following apicobasal cell division in cells associated with the basal lamina. Furthermore, we found that primary cilium reassembly occurs preferentially in daughter stem cells. Previous studies reported the asymmetric inheritance of the mother centriole by self-renewing radial glial cells in&#x000a0;the neocortex, whereas cells inheriting the daughter centriole differentiated (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Given that the mother centriole plays a key role in primary cilium assembly (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>), it can be expected that primary cilia reassemble exclusively in self-renewing cells. Consistent with our findings, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Paridaen et&#x000a0;al. (2013)</xref> reported the selective retention of the ciliary membrane in neural stem cells that inherited the mother centriole. Interestingly, the simultaneous transmission of the mother centriole associated with ciliary membrane remnant conferred a temporal advantage, as the primary cilium was&#x000a0;found to reassemble more rapidly in self-renewing daughter cells than in differentiating daughter cells. Despite extending the myofiber culture period to 96&#x000a0;hr, we did not observe an increased number of muscle progenitor cells presenting a primary cilium. This suggests that in contrast to neural stem cells, asymmetric SC cell division did not generate differential ciliogenesis kinetics but led to the selective reassembly of the primary cilium in daughter stem cells in skeletal muscles. Moreover, preventing primary cilium reassembly impaired SCs&#x02019; ability to self-renew and drove SCs to differentiation, indicating that the primary cilium functions in SC cell-fate decision and is an essential intrinsic cue required for SC self-renewal. Given that primary cilia are cellular appendages that regulate a number of signaling pathways, including SHH, WNT, PDGF, and HIPPO (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basten and Giles, 2013</xref>), one may speculate that the preferential reassembly of primary cilia in self-renewing daughter cells favors cell signaling for the induction of the self-renewal cell fate. In the neuroepithelium of developing mouse embryos, the asynchronous reassembly of primary cilia in daughter cells is associated with differential SHH response (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Piotrowska-Nitsche and Caspary, 2012</xref>). Although the evidence of a similar involvement of SHH signaling in SC self-renewal is still lacking, SHH response was shown to correlate with the presence of primary cilia in differentiating myogenic cell lines (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fu et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Also of interest is the role of the primary cilium in the control of endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin levels and the balance between canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Corbit et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lancaster et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), as these pathways are implicated in SC growth and self-renewal, respectively (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Le Grand et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Otto et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Future studies will determine whether the primary cilium controls SC self-renewal by regulating the availability of signaling pathway components.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>Experimental animal work was carried out under a UK Home Office Licence in accordance with the 1986&#x000a0;UK Animal Act.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Mice and Muscle Injury</title><p><italic>Tg(Pax7-GFP)</italic> and C57BL/6 mice were bred in-house and PCR genotyped as described previously (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sambasivan et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).
