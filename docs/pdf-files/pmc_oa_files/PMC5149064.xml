Consuming both meals could provide 58% of daily intake. This paper evaluates the contribution of SBP and NSLP meals to the dietary intakes of 5&#x02013;18&#x000a0;year old children participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2007 through 2012. The participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls. Least-square means and standard errors of the mean for energy and food group intakes for the total day and by school meal, and the percent of daily energy and food groups contributed by school meals were computed by analysis of covariance, with BMI, ethnicity, sex, age and poverty level as covariates. Of the 7800 participating children aged 5&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years in the entire dataset, 448 consumed both SBP-NSLP meals on a weekday. Almost one-half (47%) of the day's energy intake was provided by the two school meals. For the major food groups, the contribution of school meals ranged from between 40.6% for vegetables to 77.1% for milk. Overall, these results provide important information on contribution of the SBP and NSLP meals to low income children's daily dietary intake.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>School meals are a nutrition safety net for low income children.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>We assessed the contribution of both meals to children's dietary intakes.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>47% of the day's calorie intake was provided by the two school meals.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>School meals provided 41% of vegetables to 77% daily milk.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>NHANES</kwd><kwd>National School Lunch Program</kwd><kwd>School Breakfast Program</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Dietary intake</kwd><kwd>Contribution of school meals</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) was the first federally funded meal program in the United States, created in 1946 as a &#x0201c;measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children&#x02026;&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Food and Nutrition Service - U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The survey included administration of an in-person household interview and a full medical examination in a special mobile examination center (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Center for Health Statistics, 2015</xref>). The datasets from cycles 2007&#x02013;2008, 2009&#x02013;2010, and 2011&#x02013;2012 were combined and analyzed in this study.</p><p>The NHANES 24-hour dietary intake data were obtained utilizing a multi-pass method (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Blanton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Moshfegh et al., 2008</xref>). Two 24-hour dietary recalls were collected for most of the participants. The first recall was completed in-person at the mobile examination centers, while the second recall was completed over the telephone some days later, but from a smaller subsample. Parents assisted with the recalls for the young children. Only data from the first in-person dietary recall was used in the present analysis, which is acceptable as noted in NHANES documentation (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">U. S.

Because the SBP and NSLP meals were planned to provide 25% and 33% of student daily energy needs, respectively, children who consumed both meals could have received 58% of their daily intake at school (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>). The primarily low income students (82%) in the current study group obtained 47% of their daily total energy intake, 58% of fruit, 41% of total vegetables, 52% of total grains, 70% of total milk and 77% of milk from school meals (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that school meals were a safety net for these students, but could provide even more of these important food groups if all the foods in the meal were consumed.</p><p>These results can be compared to data from the SNDA III national study conducted in the 2004&#x02013;2005 school year (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>), and one conducted in Minnesota (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Robinson-O'Brien et al., 2010</xref>). The SNDA III study included a single 24-hour dietary recall from a random sample of 2314 children in grades 1 through 12 attending a nationally representative sample of US schools (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). The race/ethnicity (22% Hispanic, 17% non-Hispanic Black, 54% non-Hispanic White), and weight status (~&#x000a0;59% normal weight, ~&#x000a0;15% overweight and 24% obese) of the SNDA III sample were also similar to the current NHANES study results (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). Up to 51% of daily energy intake was supplied for the SNDA III students who consumed both SBP-NSLP meals, compared to the 47.2% in our study, but no data were provided on the contribution of food groups consumed to total daily intake (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Briefel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The mean daily intake for the SNDA III students who consumed an NSLP meal was 2149&#x000a0;kcal (kcal) (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). This is slightly higher than the daily intake for children from the current study (2031&#x000a0;kcal). The SNDA III SBP intake of 451&#x000a0;kcal provided approximately 22% of total daily energy intake (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). Children in the current study consumed 387&#x000a0;kcal from the SBP, providing 20.6% of daily energy intake. The SNDA III NSLP intake was approximately 633&#x000a0;kcal, and provided about 31% of total daily energy intake (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). The students in the current study reported lower NSLP intakes (538&#x000a0;kcal), representing 27.3% of total daily energy from the NSLP meal.</p><p>The study conducted in Minnesota in 2006 assessed the proportion of fruit and vegetables consumed at school for 103 primarily low income (90%) children ages 9&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Robinson-O'Brien et al., 2010</xref>). Their mean daily fruit and vegetable intake was 3.6 servings; 64% of daily fruit and 44% of daily vegetables consumed were provided by school meals. These proportions for the total daily intake are close to the NHANES results (57.7% fruit and 40.6% vegetables).</p><p>Differences between the current study and the two previous studies may be due to the dietary assessment methods. All used the 24-hour dietary recall, but the SNDA III and Minnesota study had the school menus and could identify school foods in the dietary recalls. In the NHANES data, food source was by self-report with no school menus, a method that has been used in previous studies with NHANES data (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cole and Fox, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The SBP and NSLP intakes reported by the students in the current study did not meet the previous school meal guidelines in place before 2012. The new meal patterns and nutrition standards that were implemented in the fall of 2012 might improve children's dietary intakes at school as they provide fruit, more vegetables (with specific subgroups required over a week), and whole grains, compared with the previous nutrition standards and meal patterns (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Food and Nutrition Service - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012</xref>). Students have to select at least one serving of a fruit or vegetable for the SBP or NSLP meal to count as a reimbursable meal, under the offer versus serve option, which is optional for elementary schools, but not for middle and high schools (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Food and Nutrition Service - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012</xref>). The opportunity to select more fruit and vegetables at meals may increase student fruit and vegetable consumption. Evaluating the impact of the new school meal patterns on school dietary intakes as well as over 24&#x000a0;h is an important area for future study.</p><p>A major weakness of this study is that the NHANES data did not directly identify whether each food was obtained from the school meal program, but was defined by eating occasion, place, food source, and day of week as reported by each participant. The nutrient composition of specially formulated foods for school meal programs might not have been available in the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, measurement errors are associated with self-reported dietary intake. Only 5.7% of the NHANES child participants consumed both a school breakfast and lunch on the recall day and 57% were male, reducing generalizability. Strengths of this study include the use of the nationally representative NHANES study data and dietary intake collected with the multiple pass method.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results provide data on the contribution of the SBP and NSLP meals on the daily dietary intake of children in the United States who ate both the school meals prior to the implementation of the new school meal patterns.
