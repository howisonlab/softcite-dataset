Here we show, that pol&#x003bb; participates at the molecular level in a chromosomal context, in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. The expression of a catalytically inactive form of pol&#x003bb; (pol&#x003bb;DN) decreases the frequency of NHEJ events in response to I-Sce-I-induced DSB whereas inactivated forms of its homologues pol&#x003b2; and pol&#x003bc; do not. Only events requiring DNA end processing before ligation are affected; this defect is associated with large deletions arising in the vicinity of the induced DSB. Furthermore, pol&#x003bb;DN-expressing cells exhibit increased sensitization and genomic instability in response to ionizing radiation similar to that of NHEJ-defective cells. Our data support a requirement for pol&#x003bb; in repairing a subset of DSB in genomic DNA, thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic stability mediated by the NHEJ pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA polymerase lambda (pol&#x003bb;) is a recently identified DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) belonging to the X family that includes the well-known pol&#x003b2; and the recently discovered pol&#x003bc; and pol&#x003c3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Previous work suggested that pol&#x003bb; could be involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), based on its homology with the yeast DNA polymerase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In addition to identified major players of NHEJ in mammalian cells, i.e. DNA-PK, Ku, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, further candidates may be required to process the DNA breaks and to create 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends available for ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Though the participation of a DNA polymerase in the NHEJ process is still a matter of debate, recent <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical studies suggest that pol&#x003bb; and/or pol&#x003bc; contribute to NHEJ function at incompatible DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, the cellular function of pol&#x003bb; remains largely unknown; indeed, cells lacking pol&#x003bb; were apparently unimpaired in response to DNA damaging agents that produce DSB, methylation or interstrand cross links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The close homology among some of the 14 identified mammalian DNA polymerases raises the possibility of functional redundancy among at least some DNA polymerases. Such redundancy might compensate the absence of pol&#x003bb; and result in the lack of a defective response to DNA damaging agents observed in pol&#x003bb;-null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>In order to study the cellular role of pol&#x003bb; in the repair of DNA DSB we expressed a catalytically inactive mutant of pol&#x003bb; (pol&#x003bb;DN) in cells bearing an integrated NHEJ or homologous recombination (HR) substrate. The overexpression of the pol&#x003bb;DN acted as a competitive inhibitor of the endogenous pol&#x003bb;. No differences were observed either in HR efficiency or in NHEJ of fully complementary ends. In contrast, the expression of the enzymatically inactive form of pol&#x003bb; strongly affected the joining efficiency for mismatches, nucleotide gaps and flap structures generated by incompletely complementary ends. The molecular analysis of the junctions revealed the presence of large deletions in all the repaired junctions of the pol&#x003bb;DN expressing cells. We further show that this NHEJ defect appear as increased sensitivity and chromosomal aberrations in cells in response to DNA DSB. Thus, it can be argued that pol&#x003bb; activity was specific of some DNA broken ends and was a determinant of the quality of the repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>The CHO-DRA10 cell line was cultured in &#x003b1;-MEM medium (GIBCO BRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and the C&#x02032;10, A&#x02032;7H, XR-1 cells (<italic>xrcc4</italic> mutant cell line) and the complemented cell line (X4V) in DMEM medium (GIBCO BRL) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).

Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were dissociated with PBS/EDTA (50 mM), washed in PBS and fixed in PBS/2% PAF for 20 min at room temperature.

Following expression and purification of the protein, the absence of DNA polymerase activity was confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> primer extension assay (see Supplementary Data). We then expressed the WT, the pol&#x003bb;DN and a truncated form of the pol&#x003bb;DN (pol&#x003bb;DN&#x00394;N) in CHO cells containing an integrated chromosomal NHEJ substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) designed to allow the measurement of NHEJ events at the molecular level by targeting breaks to this substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The pol&#x003bb; WT and pol&#x003bb;DN forms were approximately overexpressed 10-fold compared with the parental cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the first cell line (C&#x02032;10) the two I-Sce-I sites are in direct orientation creating fully complementary ends for deletion events visualized by joining of the CMV promoter to CD4; in contrast, inversion events that require partial pairing of 3&#x02032; overhangs and gap filling are recognized by juxtaposition of CD8 sequences to the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Overexpression of the WT form of pol&#x003bb; did not alter the frequency of deletion (CD4; <italic>P</italic> = 0.62) or inversion events (CD8; <italic>P</italic> = 0.27). In contrast, whereas the frequency of deletion (CD4) events involving fully complementary ends was not significantly affected (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) expression of the pol&#x003bb;DN form (RD13) resulted in a 7-fold decrease (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) in the frequency of inversion (CD8) events involving incompletely complementary ends. Therefore, the absence of an efficient pol&#x003bb; appears to be prejudicial to the repair of events that potentially require DNA synthesis. This bias was confirmed by an additional test making use of an independent cell line, A&#x02032;7H, in which (contrary to the C&#x02032;10 system) the inverted orientation of the two I-Sce-I sites creates incompletely complementary ends for deletion events (CD4) but fully complementary ends for inversion events (CD8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). No effect was observed for the frequencies of deletion (CD4) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11) versus inversion (CD8) events (<italic>P</italic> = 0.42) in A&#x02032;7H cells overexpressing the WT form of pol&#x003bb;. In contrast, in pol&#x003bb;DN-expressing A&#x02032;7H cells, deletion events (CD4) decreased by 2.3-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) while the frequency of inversion events (CD8) was unchanged (<italic>P</italic> = 0.83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To exclude the trivial possibility that the observed differences might be the simple result of varying efficiencies in I-Sce-I transfection efficiency and/or activity, we examined total H2K expression in treated cells. Deletion and inversion events that constitute total recombination activity concomitantly both reduce the number of remaining H2K-expressing gene copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We find that H2K expression diminished similarly for all the cell lines tested (data not shown). We conclude that the differing results reflect the choice of recombination mode, and not simply access to cleaved DNA. Both in A&#x02032;7H and C&#x02032;10 cell lines, the affected events are those involving incompletely complementary ends that potentially require gap filling. Expressing the pol&#x003bb;DN form led to a stronger reduction of inversion (CD8) events in the C&#x02032;10 cells than for molecularly equivalent deletion (CD4) events in the A&#x02032;7H cells. One possible explanation is that generating an inversion in C&#x02032;10 cells requires two ligation events involving incompletely complementary ends whereas only one ligation event is necessary to produce a deletion event (CD4) in the A&#x02032;7H cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). These data support the need for a functional pol&#x003bb; for the maturation of some DNA ends during the repair of DSB by NHEJ. In addition, we generated a truncated form of the pol&#x003bb;DN protein that lacks the N-terminal region comprising the BRCT and the proline rich domains that mediate protein interaction and control pol&#x003bb; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The expression of this truncated protein did not change the frequency of NHEJ events detected compared with the empty vector transfected (pI1 and pI2) control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results show that pol&#x003bb; needs to interact with functional partners to perform its repair activity, as suggested by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of an inactive form of the closest homologues of pol&#x003bb;, pol&#x003b2; and pol&#x003bc; does not affect I-Sce-I induced NHEJ events</title><p>To confirm the specificity of the effect observed with the pol&#x003bb;DN form, we expressed equivalent catalytically inactive forms of pol&#x003b2; and pol&#x003bc;, the two closest homologues of pol&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Pol&#x003b2; was two-fold overexpressed in transfected cells compared with their corresponding control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Although the expression of the inactive form of pol&#x003b2; was relatively weak compared with that of pol&#x003bb;DN, a sensitization to methyl methane sulfonate treatment was observed, meaning that the inhibition of the endogenous pol&#x003b2; for base excision repair activity was effective (data not shown). Expression of the inactive form of pol&#x003bc; was also achieved in the same cell lines and the level of overexpression was similar to that obtained with pol&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The absence of pol&#x003bc; activity was checked by an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay with the purified protein (see Supplementary Data). The expression of the inactive pol&#x003b2; (pol&#x003b2;DN) and pol&#x003bc; (pol&#x003bc;DN) in the C&#x02032;10 cell line did not significantly alter the frequency of NHEJ events (<italic>P</italic> = 0.82 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.98 for CD4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.49 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.15 for CD8 for pol&#x003bc;DN and pol&#x003b2;DN expressing cells, respectively) compared with the control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Identical results were obtained for the A&#x02032;7H cell line (<italic>P</italic> = 0.47 and 0.25 for CD4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.82 and 0.92 for CD8, for pol&#x003bc; and pol&#x003b2; expressing cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, these data underline the high specificity of pol&#x003bb; to repair the incompletely complementary DNA ends generated in our cellular system by I-Sce-I cleavage. Previous results indicated that pol&#x003bc; could participate in NHEJ <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, as in the case of pol&#x003bb; no cellular phenotype was observed after exposure to DNA damaging agents in mutant cells harbouring an invalidated pol&#x003bc; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). This might indicate that pol&#x003bc; and pol&#x003bb; have overlapping or redundant function(s). The absence of effect of catalytically inactive pol&#x003bc; on deletion and inversion frequencies seen through CD4 and CD8 markers might reflect the DNA substrate specificity of this DNA polymerase. Owing to its similarity to TdT and its terminal transferase activity, it appears plausible that pol&#x003bc; is preferentially involved in the repair of unpaired DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), eschewing DNA ends presenting partial annealing with gap and/or mismatch when normal pol&#x003bb; is present.</p></sec><sec><title>The repair junction is altered in the presence of the pol&#x003bb;DN form</title><p>In order to determine the molecular impact of pol&#x003bb; on the repair of I-Sce-I-induced DSB in a chromosomal context, we compared the resealing patterns of the partially complementary ends associated with a decreased frequency of deletion events (CD4<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We investigated the repair junction in the A&#x02032;7H cell lines expressing the WT and the pol&#x003bb;DN form, after enrichment by cell sorting of the CD4-positive cell population that results from excision and deletion of the internal I-Sce-I fragment following the joining of the two incompletely complementary ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows examples of junctions from A&#x02032;7H cells overexpressing the WT or the catalytically inactive form of pol&#x003bb;. In the cell line overexpressing the WT form of pol&#x003bb;, most of the junctions revealed processing of the four protruding nucleotides (8+3+4/18; 83%). The three classes of junctions observed could result from partial pairing of the four protruding nucleotides, leading to mismatches, gaps and flap structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The other clones showed deletions (3/18; 17%) of the sequenced junctions. Overall, our results closely resemble those previously described by Guirouilh-Barbat <italic>et al</italic>. in the same untransfected cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). These results indicate that the overexpression of pol&#x003bb; does not significantly affect the repair junction of two partially complementary ends, either quantitatively or qualitatively. In contrast, expression of the pol&#x003bb;DN was associated with large deletions in all the junctions sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The same 235 bp deletion from the I-Sce-I site to the CMV sequence was observed at the repair junctions for 19 out of 22 independent clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This deletion is, in practice, the largest we can observe, since larger deletions which affect the CMV promoter activity would eliminate the expression of the CD4 marker used to select mutant cells. Accordingly, the decrease in observed CD4 frequency could reflect such extensive deletions that affect the CMV promoter driving CD4 expression. These results show that a functional pol&#x003bb; is necessary for the maturation of partially complementary ends, and that the presence of an inactive pol&#x003bb; leads to the degradation in only one way until the finding of microhomology to allow resealing. Consequently the absence of an efficient pol&#x003bb; to process the DNA ends appears both to induce large deletions at the DNA break sites, and to prevent processing of the DNA ends by an alternative pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of the inactive form of pol&#x003bb; affects cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and camptothecin without affecting homologous recombination</title><p>We next evaluated the cellular effects of pol&#x003bb;DN in response to DNA damaging agents, in independent clones expressing the different forms of pol&#x003bb; at a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The cellular hallmark of a defect in the NHEJ function is hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). We therefore tested the possible involvement of pol&#x003bb; in this pathway by examining cell survival after IR exposure. Cell lines expressing the pol&#x003bb;DN form (RD10, RD14) showed high sensitivity to IR while cells overexpressing the WT form of pol&#x003bb; (R2, R15) were only slightly more sensitive than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In parallel, the cellular sensitivity to IR was compared with cell lines defective or complemented for the NHEJ protein XRCC4. Cells expressing the pol&#x003bb;DN showed the same cellular sensitivity to IR as the XRCC4 defective cells (XR1), and the parental DRA10 cells were as sensitive to IR as the XRCC4-complemented cells (X4V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Though these results are in accordance with a potential role of pol&#x003bb; in NHEJ, cells defective in the HR pathway are also known to display increased sensitivity to IR, albeit to a lesser extent than NHEJ defective cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). To rule out the possibility that a defect in HR may account for this phenotype, we evaluated the HR frequency in cell lines containing a HR substrate composed of two inactive copies of the neomycin resistance gene as direct repeats. The frequency of obtaining neomycin-resistant colonies reflects HR events between the two inactive copies that result in a functional neomycin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). No significant differences were observed among the tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the cellular phenotype of IR hypersensitivity was not related to a defect in HR in cells expressing the normal and the inactive forms of pol&#x003bb;. We also treated the cell lines with mitomycin C (MMC), since sensitivity to this drug is a hallmark of a defective HR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). No difference in MMC sensitivity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results reinforce the interpretation that pol&#x003bb; does not act in the HR pathway. Recent work in chicken DT40 cells showed that a defect in the NHEJ pathway increases cellular resistance to camptothecin (CPT), an inhibitor of the topoisomerase I, while a defect in the HR pathway has an opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Our examination of cellular sensitivity to CPT showed that cells overexpressing pol&#x003bb; were not affected while cells expressing the pol&#x003bb;DN form displayed a resistance to CPT compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This resistance was not due to a variation in topoisomerase I content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), nor could it be attributed to a difference in topoisomerase I activity since equivalent amounts of total cell extracts formed similar levels of topoisomerase I-DNA cleavage complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the cellular resistance to CPT is likely related to a defect in NHEJ.</p></sec><sec><title>The cellular expression of the pol&#x003bb;DN form induces genetic instability</title><p>Defective NHEJ leads to the accumulation of spontaneous or IR-induced chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). In light of the effects of expressing pol&#x003bb;DN, we performed karyotypic analyses of the different cell lines without or after treatment by IR. Chromosomal aberrations were increased in non-irradiated cells expressing the pol&#x003bb;DN form, and this genetic instability was further amplified after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A large part of the abnormalities were tri- and quadriradial chromosomes together with chromosome breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which are often observed in NHEJ defective cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The intermediate effect observed in cells overexpressing the WT form of pol&#x003bb; can be correlated with the slight sensitization to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The overexpression of pol&#x003bb; might substitute for some cellular components affecting NHEJ activity. Identical chromosomal instability was observed with a human fibroblast cell line (MRC5) transfected with the pol&#x003bb;DN form, allowing us to rule out a species-specific effect of the DNA polymerase (data not shown).</p><p>Altogether, these results strongly support a role of pol&#x003bb; in the NHEJ-DSB repair process following genotoxic stress. This study demonstrates that pol&#x003bb; participates in the NHEJ pathway in mammalian cells. Importantly, it has a very specific role in the processing of DNA ends requiring some potential gap filling before ligation leading to the protection of DNA ends against extensive degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that another DNA polymerase of the X family, pol&#x003bc;, could be involved in the repair of DSB presenting non-compatible DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, biochemical and cellular studies strongly suggest that pol&#x003bc; is more specialized in the processing of DNA end structures containing no homology and found in V(D)J recombination during the repair of Ig&#x003ba; recombination intermediates, in accordance with its specific ability to polymerise across a DSB with no pairing between the primer and the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In addition, a study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) using cell extracts and DNA ends presenting a limited homology (2 nt and a 2 nt gap) similar to our intracellular NHEJ substrate, showed that immunodepletion of pol&#x003bb;, but not pol&#x003bc;, abolished the joining of these DNA ends <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Overall, these results show that the contribution of each polymerase in the repair of DSB depends on the sequence and specific overhang structure of the DNA ends. Whether another DNA polymerase can substitute for or act in concert with pol&#x003bb; to repair the different types of DSB induced by genotoxic stress during NHEJ remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Luis Blanco for providing the cDNA of pol&#x003bb;, Dr Said Aoufouchi for providing the cDNA of pol&#x003bc; and Dr Maria Jasin for providing the CHO-DRA10 cell line and the I-Sce-I expression vector.

CD4 is not expressed because it is too far from the pCMV promoter. Two I-Sce-I sites are present in non-coding sequences. After cleavage by I-Sce-I, the internal H2-Kd/CD8 fragment is excised. Re-joining of the DNA ends can lead to two different measurable events, deletion which leads to expression of the CD4 gene and inversion which leads to expression of the CD8 gene.
