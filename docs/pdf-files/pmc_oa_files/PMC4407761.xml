The World Health Organization estimates that 20% of children are infected with influenza virus each year, and they are the main source of spread of the virus and have a high burden of the disease [<xref rid="JIU654C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Vaccination is the cornerstone of prophylaxis and is recommended for high-risk patients. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) is safe and provides protection but may not be the optimal vaccine for young children, owing to their lack of previous infection. Since 2003, the cold-adapted live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), administered as a nasal spray, has been approved in the United States for individuals aged 2&#x02013;49 years. The vaccine was licensed in Europe in 2012 (for individuals aged 2&#x02013;17 years) and was implemented in the British childhood vaccination campaign, beginning in 2013 [<xref rid="JIU654C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In June 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices preferentially recommended LAIV in healthy children 2&#x02013;8 years old when it is immediately available [<xref rid="JIU654C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite many years on the market, there are no established correlates of protection for LAIV. Efficacy studies and observational data suggest that the LAIV provides higher levels of protection than TIV in children [<xref rid="JIU654C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU654C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer is widely used as a surrogate correlate of protection after TIV receipt; however, the cutoff titer of 1:40 is based on adult trials. There is debate on both the protective HI level in children and the fact that an HI titer underestimates the protection obtained by LAIV [<xref rid="JIU654C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU654C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cellular immunity may be a better measure of protective immunity after LAIV in children [<xref rid="JIU654C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have the ability to act as effector cells and to direct and generate specific memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets with diverse functions [<xref rid="JIU654C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU654C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Animal and human studies have demonstrated protective cellular immunity after LAIV [<xref rid="JIU654C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU654C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the duration and quality of the immune response in humans after LAIV needs to be studied.</p><p>We conducted a pediatric clinical trial to elucidate the immunological mechanisms induced by LAIV, with emphasis on the long-term, strain-specific cellular immune responses. Our study is unique, as we obtained sequential blood samples from young children up to 1 year after vaccination, allowing us to compare and analyze serum and cellular responses in the same child. Our results indicate that LAIV induces long-term humoral and cellular immune responses in children and that priming is important in determining the magnitude of the response.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p>Thirty-eight healthy children, consisting of 20 boys and 18 girls aged 3&#x02013;17 years old, were recruited at Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) in Norway. From October 2012 to January 2013, children were immunized with the trivalent seasonal LAIV (Fluenz, Astra Zeneca, Birmingham, United Kingdom). Fluenz contained 10<sup>7.0</sup> fluorescent focus units of attenuated reassortant of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 strains. The vaccine was administered intranasally as 0.1 mL per nostril. Children 3&#x02013;9 years old received 2 doses at a 4-week interval, and children &#x02265;10 years old received a single dose of vaccine as recommended by the manufacturer. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Western Norway and the Norwegian Medicines Agency and was monitored by HUH (clinical trials registration, NCT01866540; EUDRACT registration 2012-002848-24).</p><p>Upon enrollment, parents and children aged &#x02265;12 years provided voluntary, written informed consent. We collected data on baseline demographic characteristics, medical and influenza vaccination history, and risk factors for influenza virus infection. All procedures were conducted at the pediatric trial unit at HUH. Children with mild-to-moderate asthma (clinically stable with daily use of inhalators) or who had received prior influenza vaccination were included. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU654F1">1</xref>. A self-reported questionnaire of local and systemic side effects was completed after each vaccination.

Less is known about the long-term immunological responses, but there are studies reporting the durability of serum and local antibodies and the efficacy of LAIV [<xref rid="JIU654C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longevity of the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by LAIV in young children, with a focus on the effect of priming. To our knowledge, our study is unique in reporting the long-term immune responses to LAIV in children, including those with asthma. We found that the vaccine was safe and easy to administer, with mild side effects after the first dose and even fewer side effects after the second dose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu654/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>).</p><p>This study was conducted during a postpandemic period, when the H1N1 strain dominated. In general, the highest immune response was against the B strain, followed by the H3N2 strain, with the lowest response against the H1N1 strain. The total levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM were stable throughout the study period [<xref rid="JIU654C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The serological response to LAIV was evaluated by an HI assay, with differences observed in the response to the H1N1 and H3N2 strains. Before vaccination, the majority of the children had protective antibody titers (HI titer, &#x02265;40) against the H1N1 strain, which did not increase after vaccination but remained elevated 1 year after vaccination. This may be because H1N1 was a dominant circulating influenza A strain in 2009 and 2010. Hence, most of the children were primed, either by natural infection or pandemic vaccination [<xref rid="JIU654C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As LAIV must replicate to elicit an immune response, the presence of preexisting antibodies or cross-reactive T cells in primed children could inhibit virus infection and replication, resulting in lower HI responses. In contrast, the H3N2 strain circulated to a much lesser degree in Norway; hence, most children were unprimed against this strain [<xref rid="JIU654C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The B strain had limited circulation in the prior seasons, except during 2010&#x02013;2011; it is therefore possible that most children were naive to this strain, consistent with the observation that LAIVs elicit stronger immune responses in unprimed children [<xref rid="JIU654C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Apart from priming, differences in infectivity among the vaccine strains could also impact the subsequent immune response. We saw no difference in durability of the immune response after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu654/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures 3 and 4</ext-link>).</p><p>Induction of long-term immunological memory is the ultimate goal of vaccination. In this study, levels of influenza virus&#x02013;specific memory B cells increased after vaccination and were maintained for 1 year. Memory B cells can rapidly differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmablasts upon antigen reencounter. They may possess broad cross-reactivity and the ability to go through secondary affinity maturation to altered antigenic epitopes [<xref rid="JIU654C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> memory B-cell responses in our study were strain dependent. When we divided the children according to a protective HI titer of 40, we observed that, in influenza virus&#x02013;primed children, the levels of memory B cells were not boosted upon vaccination (data not shown). The lack of a boosting response after vaccination in B cells in primed individuals has previously been described in adults [<xref rid="JIU654C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast to the IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> memory B-cell responses, the IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B-cell response increased significantly against all 3 influenza virus strains. Recent research suggests that isotype-switched, affinity-matured memory B cells dominate the antibody-secreting cell response on antigen recall, while the majority of IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells contain less somatic hypermutations and dominate the formation of new germinal centers [<xref rid="JIU654C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells live longer than their isotype-switched counterparts [<xref rid="JIU654C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, the influenza virus&#x02013;specific IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells may contain a population with the potential to respond to novel antigenic variants (eg, drifted influenza viruses). The observed strain variations may indicate a biological threshold for memory B-cell responses in children with preexisting memory B cells due to previous influenza virus exposure.</p><p>LAIV mimics natural infection and activates the innate immune system, as well as both humoral and T-cell responses, which play a key role in cross-reactive anti&#x02013;influenza virus responses [<xref rid="JIU654C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. T cells depend on major histocompatibility complex presentation of viral antigens and, hence, cannot prevent infection per se. Human studies have shown naturally acquired CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to be important in limiting disease and may provide heterosubtypic immunity, which may influence the influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) response [<xref rid="JIU654C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. T cells respond to conserved epitopes, which is why the response to influenza A viruses is interlinked. Importantly, cross-reactive T cells elicited by LAIV have the potential to protect against drifted strains and shifted pandemic strains. This has been demonstrated in animal models [<xref rid="JIU654C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. LAIV-induced cross-reactive antibodies have been found in humans, but it has yet to be determined whether LAIV induces cross-protective T cells in humans.</p><p>Using a direct ELISpot assay, we determined the IFN-&#x003b3; T-cell response following LAIV immunization. This ELISpot assay is more sensitive than serum antibody responses in determining the influenza virus&#x02013;specific memory immune response with an arbitrary number of 100 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs suggested as a protective level against clinical influenza after LAIV in a trial of &#x0003e;2000 children [<xref rid="JIU654C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, 5 subjects in our study who, on the basis of HI assays, did not seroconvert to H1N1 had a significant increase in their IFN-&#x003b3; response after 2 vaccine doses, which may provide clinical protection. In fact, HI titers are known to underestimate the protective effect achieved by the LAIV in children, and clinical efficacy studies on LAIV have shown high levels of protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza despite low HI titers [<xref rid="JIU654C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Studies in adults have found that LAIV elicits higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses than TIV to the variant region of hemagglutinin, suggesting that antigenically distinct mutants that escape antibody responses may still be recognized by T cells [<xref rid="JIU654C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that simultaneously secrete IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, or TNF-&#x003b1; (multifunctional T cells) are functionally superior than single cytokine producers at inducing anti&#x02013;influenza virus immunity [<xref rid="JIU654C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, we have shown that LAIV induces a significant increase in both single-cytokine and multifunctional Th1 responses in children. The magnitude of the Th1 cytokine responses induced after LAIV receipt was lower than observed in adult subjects after intramuscular vaccination with candidate pandemic vaccines [<xref rid="JIU654C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Differences in the route of administration (intramuscular or intranasal) and formulation with the adjuvant in immunologically naive subjects could partly explain the superiority of the parenteral vaccine at inducing a Th1 response in peripheral blood. However, in children, LAIV has been shown to be a better inducer of T-cell responses than TIV [<xref rid="JIU654C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="JIU654C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This may explain, at least in part, the higher efficacy of LAIV, compared with TIV, in children during head-to-head clinical trials [<xref rid="JIU654C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nonetheless, vaccine-induced long-lived memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may provide broader protection and should be a goal of novel vaccines [<xref rid="JIU654C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With respect to cytotoxic T cells, we did not detect an increase in antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses at any time point after LAIV receipt. This is most likely due to the use of split virus proteins for in vitro PBMC stimulation, resulting in inefficient antigen cross-presentation to stimulate a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response.</p><p>Here, we have demonstrated that LAIV elicits elevated and sustained humoral and T-cell responses in young children at least 1 year after vaccination and that there is great interstrain variation in responses. This was recently addressed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which noted that the LAIV gave less protection than TIV against the H1N1 strain alone [<xref rid="JIU654C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study provides support to public health officials in determining the benefit of their childhood vaccine programs when considering safety and obtaining long-lasting immune responses toward influenza virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu654/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
