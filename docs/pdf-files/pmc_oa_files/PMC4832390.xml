However, during tumoral expansion, the regulation of cathepsin B can be altered at multiple levels, thereby resulting in its overexpression and export outside of the cell. This may suggest a possible role of cathepsin B in alterations leading to cancer progression. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of intracellular and extracellular cathepsin B in growth, tumorigenesis, and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Results show that mRNA and activated levels of cathepsin B were both increased in human adenomas and in CRCs of all stages. Treatment of CRC cells with the highly selective and non&#x02010;permeant cathepsin B inhibitor Ca074 revealed that extracellular cathepsin B actively contributed to the invasiveness of human CRC cells while not essential for their growth in soft agar. Cathepsin B silencing by RNAi in human CRC cells inhibited their growth in soft agar, as well as their invasion capacity, tumoral expansion, and metastatic spread in immunodeficient mice. Higher levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were observed in cathepsin B&#x02010;deficient tumors as well as an increase in cyclin B1. Finally, cathepsin B colocalized with p27<sup>Kip1</sup> within the lysosomes and efficiently degraded the inhibitor. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that cathepsin B is a significant factor in colorectal tumor development, invasion, and metastatic spreading and may, therefore, represent a potential pharmacological target for colorectal tumor therapy. &#x000a9; 2015 The Authors. <italic>Molecular Carcinogenesis</italic>, published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="mc22312-kwd-0001">cathepsin B</kwd><kwd id="mc22312-kwd-0002">colorectal cancers</kwd><kwd id="mc22312-kwd-0003">invasion</kwd><kwd id="mc22312-kwd-0004">intestinal tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd id="mc22312-kwd-0005">p27<sup>Kip1</sup></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)</funding-source><award-id>CTP&#x02010;82942</award-id><award-id>MT&#x02010;14405</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>mc22312</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>May 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:4.8.6 mode:remove_FC converted:15.04.2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><def-list list-content="abbreviations" id="mc22312-dl-0002"><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0001">APC</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0002"><p>adenomatous polyposis coli</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0003">CDK</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0004"><p>cyclin&#x02010;dependent kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0005">CHX</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0006"><p>cycloheximide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0007">CRC</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0008"><p>colorectal cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0009">CTSB</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0010"><p>cathepsin B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0011">ERK</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0012"><p>extracellular signal regulated kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0013">FCS</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0014"><p>fetal calf serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0015">HEK</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0016"><p>human embryonic kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0017">IEC</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0018"><p>intestinal epithelial cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0019">Kip1</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0020"><p>kinase inhibitory protein 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0021">Kip2</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0022"><p>kinase inhibitory protein 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0023">MAPK</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0024"><p>mitogen&#x02010;activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0025">Min</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0026"><p>multiple intestinal neoplasia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0027">MMP</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0028"><p>matrix metalloproteases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0029">RNAi</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0030"><p>RNA interference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0031">uPA</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0032"><p>urokinase&#x02010;type plasminogen activator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="mc22312-ldef-0033">Wnt</term><def id="mc22312-ldef-0034"><p>Wingless</p></def></def-item></def-list><sec id="mc22312-sec-0002"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major malignancies worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in North America. CRC develops through multiple steps, with the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations in key tumor suppressors and oncogenes. This knowledge has been largely derived from early research on CRC <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. The phenotypic hallmarks of cancer cells include the ability to invade and metastasize which depends on the action of proteases actively taking center stage in extracellular proteolysis during cancer progression <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Of all the proteases, the cysteine protease cathepsin B is of significant importance as it is involved in various pathologies and oncogenic processes <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Cathepsin B primarily functions as an endopeptidase within endolysosomal compartments in normal cells. However, during malignant transformation, the regulation of cathepsin B can be altered at multiple levels thereby resulting in its overproduction <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Mechanisms that increase cathepsin B expression in tumors and in tumor&#x02010;associated cells include genetic amplification or alternative splicing <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Moreover, in tumors, cathepsin B can either be secreted, bound to the cell membrane or released by shedding vesicles <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Expression and redistribution of active cathepsin B to the basal plasma membrane occurs in late colon adenomas <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> coincident with the activation of KRAS <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. In line with these results, Cavallo&#x02010;Medved et al. <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> have demonstrated that trafficking of cathepsin B to caveolae and its secretion are regulated by active KRAS in CRC cells in culture. Accordingly, secretion of cathepsin B is increased in the extracellular environment of CRC <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> where it is suspected to play an essential role in disrupting extracellular matrix barriers between tumors and surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating invasion and metastasis <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. Altogether, these data are consistent with the link between cathepsin B protein expression in colorectal carcinomas and shortened patient survival <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>.</p><p>In a recent prospective cohort study of 558 men and women with colonic tumors accessible for immunohistochemical assessment, Chan et al. <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> found that 82% of patients had tumors that expressed cathepsin B, irrespective of stage, while the remaining 18% had tumors that did not express cathepsin B. Moreover, other studies have suggested that cathepsin B expression or activity may actually peak during early stage cancer and subsequently decline with advanced disease <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Thus, the above data point to a possible role of cathepsin B in both early and late alterations leading to tumor formation in the colon.</p><p>In light of the above, the present study used two strategies to specifically counteract the action of cathepsin B. The first involved the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the expression of cathepsin B protein into CRC cells while the second approach employed the highly selective cathepsin inhibitor Ca074 to block extracellular cathepsin B activity. Results suggest that extracellular cathepsin B is involved in cell invasion whereas intracellular cathepsin B controls tumoral properties of CRC cells. Of further importance, biochemical analysis suggests that intracellular cathepsin B regulates tumorigenesis by degrading the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> cell cycle inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="mc22312-sec-0003"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="mc22312-sec-0004"><title>Materials</title><sec id="mc22312-sec-0005"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies were obtained from the following sources: Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase&#x02010;&#x003b1;, calnexin, calpain 2, CDK2, cyclin B1, cyclin E, ERK2, lamin B, HA tag, p21, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, p57<sup>Kip2</sup>, &#x003b2;&#x02010;tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), &#x003b2;&#x02010;actin from Chemicon International (Billerica, MA), phospho&#x02010;AKT (Ser473), AKT, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), and Lamp1 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and Cathepsin B from R&#x00026;D Systems (Mississauga, ON, Canada).

Cathepsin B also possesses a basic amino acid in the catalytic subsite in position S2 enabling the protease to preferentially split its substrates after Arg&#x02013;Arg or Lys&#x02013;Arg or Arg&#x02013;Lys sequences. At least five of these sequences can be found within the human p27<sup>Kip1</sup> sequence (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Therefore, the first amino acid of these doublets was mutated into alanine to test whether it would affect the degradation by cathepsin B. Mutation of arginine 58 (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E) and lysine 189 (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F) did not alter the cleavage profile of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> by cathepsin B. Mutation of lysine 165 and arginine 194 also had no altering effect (not shown). On the other hand, mutation of arginine 152 into alanine markedly reduced the detection of the 20&#x02010;kDa fragment (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E).</p><p>In order to identify other cleavage sites, deletion mutants of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were generated by removal of different sequences of five to ten amino acids (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). All of these mutants were expressed in 293&#x02009;T cells and lysates subsequently exposed to cathepsin B cleavage (data not shown). The lower fragment was not observed with the p27 &#x00394;96&#x02013;100 mutant following cathepsin B cleavage, suggesting the presence of a cleavage site within this sequence (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). This particular sequence contains a glycine, and cathepsin B endopeptidase specificity has been reported to be also guided by the presence of a glycine in position P3&#x02032; of the scissile bound <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. Of note, the 12&#x02010; and 20&#x02010;kDa fragments were not observed when arginine 152 was mutated in alanine in the &#x00394;96&#x02013;100 mutant (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). Moreover, with the p27&#x00394;189&#x02013;198 mutant, both the 12&#x02010; and 20&#x02010;kDa fragments were still detected (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F), although the modest shift&#x02010;down of 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;kDa normally produced following cathepsin B cleavage of full&#x02010;length p27<sup>Kip1</sup> was not observed (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F, lower less&#x02010;exposed gel). Single point mutation of each amino acid in the 189&#x02013;198 sequence did not prevent the generation of the 26&#x02010;kDa fragment following cathepsin B treatment (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F for residue 189 as an example). This suggests that this 26&#x02010;kDa fragment probably results from the exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B.</p><p>The protein stability of wild&#x02010;type p27<sup>Kip1</sup> was then compared to that of the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> R152A/&#x00394;189&#x02013;198 mutant, which is more resistant to cathepsin B cleavage. 293T cells were transiently transfected with either wild&#x02010;type p27<sup>Kip1</sup> or p27<sup>Kip1</sup> mutant and subsequently treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein neosynthesis. Thereafter, cells were lysed at different time intervals in order to analyze protein expression levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> forms. As shown in Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, following cycloheximide treatment, protein levels of the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> mutant decreased much more slowly than that of wild&#x02010;type protein.

Of note, forced expression of cathepsin B in 293&#x02009;T cells dose&#x02010;dependently reduced the wild&#x02010;type form of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein levels while expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> R152A/&#x00394;189&#x02013;198 mutant was only very slightly affected (Figure <xref rid="mc22312-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="mc22312-fig-0006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Cathepsin B reduces p27<sup>Kip1</sup> stability.

The present findings demonstrate that cathepsin B has not only a role in facilitating CRC invasion and metastasis, but also in mediating early premalignant processes. Results herein show that cathepsin B promotes anchorage&#x02010;independent CRC cell growth, which translates in vivo to enhanced tumor growth. In addition, cathepsin B was identified as a new protease capable of proteolytic cleavage of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. This is especially relevant since the loss of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression has been strongly associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical outcome in CRC <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>.</p><p>While many studies have been conducted on cathepsin B expression in CRC <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, the present study specifically analyzed the expression of this protease at both the mRNA and active protein levels as well as its putative association with mutations in <italic>APC</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic>. Results revealed increased cathepsin B mRNA and protein levels in colorectal tumors, irrespective of tumor stage. These data are reminiscent of the immunohistochemistry data reported by Chan et al. <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> showing that cathepsin B protein was expressed in the vast majority of colon cancers analyzed (558 tumors), which was also independent of tumor stage. The present data also revealed that increased transcription of cathepsin B was associated with the presence of mutations in <italic>APC</italic> but not in <italic>KRAS</italic>, thus emphasizing the fact that <italic>cathepsin B</italic> gene expression is already deregulated in early stages of colorectal carcinoma. Indeed, most CRCs acquire loss&#x02010;of&#x02010;function mutations in both copies of the <italic>APC</italic> gene, resulting in inefficient breakdown of intracellular &#x003b2;&#x02010;catenin and enhanced nuclear signaling <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. Given the importance of the Wnt/APC/&#x003b2;&#x02010;catenin pathway in human tumorigenesis initiation, the present data showing an association between cathepsin B expression and <italic>APC</italic> mutations are particularly noteworthy. Further studies will be of interest to determine whether this association is correlative or causative. Additional evidence stemming from other studies with <italic>APC<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice nonetheless suggests the contribution of this protease in tumorigenesis with mutated <italic>APC</italic>. These mice are heterozygous for a germ&#x02010;line mutation in the mouse homologue of the human <italic>APC</italic> gene and develop multiple adenomas in the intestine <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. Cathepsin B was also found to be consistently overexpressed in these adenomatous polyps both at the mRNA and protein levels <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. In addition, genetic ablation of <italic>cathepsin B</italic> resulted in suppression of tumor infiltrating pro&#x02010;inflammatory cells and in attenuation of polyposis in these mice <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. In a proteomic screening study, cathepsin B was also recently identified as one of the six upregulated proteins in the tumors of <italic>APC<sup>&#x00394;580</sup></italic> mice <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Such observations again suggest that cathepsin B may be implicated early in the process of tumorigenesis. These results hence support a role for cathepsin B in <italic>APC</italic>&#x02010;mutated tumors and lend credence to the possibility of cathepsin B being a therapeutic target for these cancers.</p><p>In agreement with other studies that have shown that secretion of cathepsin B is increased in the extracellular environment of several types of cancer cells <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, results obtained herein in CRC cells in culture confirmed the presence of the pro&#x02010;form of cathepsin B in conditioned culture medium of all CRC cells. However, the catalytically active processed forms of cathepsin B were not detected by Western blot analysis. In keeping with this finding, no cathepsin B enzyme activity was detected in the conditioned medium. This indicates that CRC cells massively secrete pro&#x02010;cathepsin B but not the active forms of cathepsin B and is consistent with previous studies showing that overexpression of cathepsins is frequently accompanied by the secretion of pro&#x02010;cathepsins (reviewed in <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>). With regard to CRC, it has been reported that cathepsin B moves from the apical region of the cells to the basal plasma membranes, in parallel with malignant progression to late adenomas and early carcinomas. Prior studies using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells have shown that trafficking of cathepsin B to caveolae and its subsequent secretion were regulated by active KRAS <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Outside of the cells, cathepsin B was moreover ideally positioned to degrade basal membrane components <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> or to activate uPA and MMPs <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, hence promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Since pro&#x02010;cathepsin B is catalytically inactive, the contribution of secreted cathepsin B to extracellular matrix degradation can, therefore, be questioned. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that extracellular components of the extracellular matrix can facilitate the processing of cathepsins <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. Furthermore, under acidic pH conditions, pro&#x02010;cathepsins are effectively processed into catalytically mature proteases either autocatalytically <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> or by other proteases. Accordingly, inhibition of extracellular cathepsin B activity in the present study by the non&#x02010;permeant inhibitor Ca074 markedly attenuated CRC cell invasion through Matrigel suggesting that secreted pro&#x02010;cathepsin B was in fact activated under such conditions. Cathepsin B silencing in these same CRC cells also reduced the number of invading cells to a similar extent as that observed with Ca074 in vitro, in addition to inhibiting their metastatic properties in vivo. In keeping with these results, increased serum levels of cathepsin B have been found in patients with CRC <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. Taken together, these results further support the notion that extracellular cathepsin B may play an important function in CRC invasion and metastasis. Of note, intraperitoneal administration of Ca074 was reported to reduce bone metastasis in a model of breast cancer <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting extracellular cathepsin B activity. This metastasis suppression by Ca074 was maintained in a late treatment setting, pointing to a role for this protease in metastatic outgrowth.</p><p>An additional finding of this study is the requirement of cathepsin B for anchorage&#x02010;independent growth and tumorigenesis. Cathepsin B silencing in CRC cells inhibited their capacity to grow in soft agar and to form tumors in mice. One could speculate that intracellular cathepsin B possibly mediates these functions since Ca074 did not alter growth in soft agar. However, in vivo approaches targeting extracellular active cathepsin B are nonetheless needed to clearly confirm such activity. Furthermore, investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of cathepsin B silencing on tumor growth revealed reduced levels of cyclin B1 and increased levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein in cathepsin B&#x02010;deficient tumors. Cyclin B1 is the major controlling cyclin in the G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle and its expression may reflect the proliferative state of the tumor <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>. p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is a cell cycle regulator which negatively inhibits cyclin&#x02010;CDK complexes and acts as a key protein in the decision between proliferation and cell cycle exit. As cells progress toward S&#x02010;phase, transcriptional regulation, translational control, and ubiquitin/proteasome&#x02010;mediated degradation lead to a decline in p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (reviewed in <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>). Moreover, increased proteasome&#x02010;dependent degradation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is particularly observed in aggressive colorectal carcinomas and other cancers <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>. In keeping with this observation, the absence of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein expression is a powerful negative prognostic marker in colorectal carcinomas <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>. For instance, homozygous p27<sup>Kip1</sup> mutation was consistently found to increase the number of intestinal polyps in <italic>Apc</italic> mutant mice by five&#x02010; to sixfold <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>. Herein, cathepsin B was also identified as a novel protease potentially involved in the regulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression. Results show that, in vitro, this protease was able to specifically cleave the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein. The observation that cathepsin B and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> partially colocalized into the lysosomes suggests that some p27<sup>Kip1</sup> cleavage occurred in lysosomes. Supporting this notion, mutations of cathepsin B cleavage sites increased p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein stability. Accordingly, endolysosomal degradation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> was also previously demonstrated in Hela and NIH3T3 cells, contributing to the progression of their cell cycle <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>. This particular pathway of p27 degradation appears to be mediated by its interaction with the endosomal protein SNX6, a member of the sorting nexin family of vesicular trafficking regulator <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this SNX6&#x02010;dependent p27<sup>Kip1</sup> proteolytic pathway remain unknown. The present cell models cultured on a plastic substratum (2D culture) did not allow to consistently detect significant modulation of total p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein expression following cathepsin B silencing (data not shown). In addition, Western blot analyses of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression demonstrated that this cell cycle inhibitory protein was expressed at various levels in CRC cells without any correlation with intracellular cathepsin B expression (Supplementary Figure S1). This suggests that in cultured CRC cells and as previously reported in other cancer cell lines (reviewed in <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>), p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein expression may be regulated by multiple oncogenic pathways. By contrast, a decrease in p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression was observed after forced overexpression of cathepsin B in 293&#x02009;T cells, although p27<sup>Kip1</sup> fragments could not be detected in cell lysates. One could speculate that once generated, these fragments are rapidly degraded in the lysosomes. However, a marked increase in p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein levels was found in cathepsin B&#x02010;deficient colorectal tumors derived from mice suggesting that this lysosomal proteolytic pathway is likely to occur in the context of tumorigenesis or 3D CRC cell culture.</p><p>In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that cathepsin B plays a significant role in colorectal tumor development, invasion, and metastasis. Results suggest that intracellular cathepsin B activity controls premalignant processes such as anchorage&#x02010;independent growth and tumor formation while extracellular cathepsin B regulates invasive properties of CRC cells. p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is furthermore identified as a new molecular target of cathepsin B in CRC cells. Since p27<sup>Kip1</sup> acts as a tumor suppressor, the impairment of its function may increase the tumoral properties of colorectal cells, as shown previously in APC<sup>Min/+</sup> mice <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>, <xref rid="mc22312-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>. As such, cathepsin B may, therefore, represent a valuable target for colorectal tumor therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><p>Additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web&#x02010;site.</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
