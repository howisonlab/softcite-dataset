We describe a program, the Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project, that provides a step toward the aim of knocking out all genes and screening each line for a broad range of traits. We found that hitherto unpublished genes were as likely to reveal phenotypes as known genes, suggesting that novel genes represent a rich resource for investigating the molecular basis of disease. We found many unexpected phenotypes detected only because we screened for them, emphasizing the value of screening all mutants for a wide range of traits. Haploinsufficiency and pleiotropy were both surprisingly common. Forty-two percent of genes were essential for viability, and these were less likely to have a paralog and more likely to contribute to a protein complex than other genes. Phenotypic data and more than 900 mutants are openly available for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>PaperClip</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc9"><media xlink:href="mmc9.mp3"/></supplementary-material></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Large openly available resource of targeted mouse mutants and phenotypic data</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Screen for broad range of disease features and traits</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Many novel phenotypes suggest functions for both studied and unstudied genes</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Haploinsufficiency and pleiotropy are common</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>More than 900 new mutant mice lines and a multifaceted phenotypic screening platform reveal unanticipated pleiotropies, widespread effects of haploinsufficiency, potential disease models, and functions for unstudied genes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: July 18, 2013</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The availability of well-annotated genome sequences for a variety of organisms has provided a strong foundation on which much biological knowledge has been assembled, including the generation of comprehensive genetic resources. This has been achieved in several model organisms, including <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic>, <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S.&#x000a0;pombe</italic>, <italic>A.&#x000a0;thaliana</italic>, <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic>, and <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic>, greatly facilitating studies focused on single genes and enabling genome-wide genetic screens.</p><p>Annotation of the human genome has identified over 20,000 protein-coding genes as well as many noncoding RNAs. Despite the dramatic increase in the knowledge of variation in human genomes, the normal function of many genes is still unknown or predicted from sequence analysis alone, and consequently, the disease significance of rare variants remains obscure. Furthermore, there remains a large bias toward research on a small number of the best-known genes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Realizing the full value of the complete human genome sequence requires broadening this focus, and the availability of comprehensive biological resources will facilitate this process.</p><p>The mouse is a key model organism for assessing mammalian gene function, providing access to conserved processes such as&#x000a0;development, metabolism, and physiology. Genetic studies in mice, mostly via targeted mutagenesis in ES cells, have described a function for 7,229 genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt" id="intref0010">ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt</ext-link>, February 2013). The vast majority of these studies have been directed at previously studied (known) genes, driven by previous biological knowledge. Phenotype-driven screens have also identified genes associated with specific phenotypes, although to a smaller extent. Although targeted mutagenesis has been very successful, the global distribution of the effort has resulted in significant heterogeneity in allele design, genetic background of mice used, and their phenotypic analysis. Furthermore, the biological focus of most targeted knockout experiments is constrained by the expertise of the specific research group. As a result, many phenotypes have not&#x000a0;been detected, and consequently, the full biological function of many genes studied using knockout mice is significantly underreported.</p><p>Some efforts to generate and phenotype sizeable sets of new targeted alleles of genes of interest have been reported previously (e.g., <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). These studies focused on specific categories of molecules such as secreted and transmembrane proteins or other &#x0201c;drugable&#x0201d; targets. Other research centers have established mouse clinics, with the aim of carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the phenotypes of mutant lines of specific interest (e.g., <xref rid="bib17 bib41 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Wakana et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Laughlin et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The genome-wide set of targeted mutations in ES cells established by the KOMP, EUCOMM, and MirKO programs (<xref rid="bib37 bib33 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Skarnes et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Prosser et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Park et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) provides an opportunity to conduct systematic, large-scale gene function analysis in a mammalian system without the variables inherent in studies by individual groups. The Sanger Institute&#x02019;s Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) was one of the first programs to pursue this objective, established in 2006 when the first targeted ES cells became available. The MGP later expanded to contribute to a European phenotyping effort, EUMODIC, and more recently has become a founding member of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC).

As the first established large-scale project using the KOMP/EUCOMM ES cells, the MGP has provided pilot data to inform the design of the international effort, such as the advantages of a single pipeline design, optimum numbers of mice, and details of variance for specific phenotyping tests.

Mutant data were compared to the relevant reference range and variant phenotypes determined using a standardized set of rules (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). We aimed to highlight phenotypes with large effect sizes. This approach results in conservative calls and minimizes false positives. There was very little missing data (2.14% of all calls; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). The maximum number of parameters collected per line was 263. Of these, 147 were categorical variables, for example normal or abnormal teeth, whereas 116, such as plasma magnesium levels, exhibited a continuous distribution from which outliers were identified.

Body weight and fat/lean composition were among the most common anomalies, with both overweight (n&#x000a0;= 2) and underweight (n&#x000a0;= 21) mutants discovered. The <italic>Kptn</italic> mutant is an example of an unexpected phenotype. Kptn is a putative actin binding protein proposed as a candidate for deafness because it is expressed in sensory hair cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bearer et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>).

These examples demonstrate that many phenotypes will be missed unless they are specifically looked for and illustrate the value of carrying out a broad range of screens with all mutants going through all screens.

Thus, haploinsufficiency is relatively common, suggesting that screening heterozygotes of knockout lines can yield valuable insight into gene function and provide models for dominantly inherited human disorders. All 90 genes screened as heterozygotes had at least 1 hit (usually viability) and together gave a total of 181 hits (ranging from 1 to 14 per line), an average of 2.0 per line, or 1.0 per line if we consider that abnormal viability is a feature of the homozygote.

Of the lines screened as homozygotes or hemizygotes, 35% (56&#x000a0;of 160) appeared completely normal in our screen. There are several possible explanations for the lack of a detected phenotype, such as incomplete inactivation of the gene, a subtle change in phenotype not detected by our screen, or the gene may be nonessential.

Importantly, for 56 genes, a new phenotype was detected by our screen (column K, <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). For 31 genes, features of the published phenotype were assessed but not detected by our pipeline.

However, many additional phenotypes were detected in the mouse mutants suggesting additional features that might also occur in patients that have hitherto not been reported.

Individual endeavors have led to wide variation in allele design and genetic backgrounds used, and all too often, the mutant is not available to other groups for further analysis. In contrast, the mutant mice described here have the advantage of a common genetic background and a standard allele design with the option of generating conditional mutations, and all are available from public repositories.</p><p>The phenotyping described here was not intended to provide an exhaustive characterization of the phenotype of the mutant lines but, rather, to place mutant alleles into broad categories by using screens, generating a pool of genetic resources from which individual mutants can be selected based on their phenotype for secondary follow-up studies. Several of the mutants have been analyzed further following an initial phenotypic observation in the screen, and these add to the depth of our knowledge of biological mechanisms of disease (e.g., <xref rid="bib30 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Nijnik et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Crossan et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). As the assembled data expands, it will become possible to discern patterns between phenotypes and come to more holistic conclusions about categories of genes. Genes linked by common phenotypes can be grouped together to test for regulatory or other functional interactions and ultimately placed into pathways that in turn will implicate other genes in the disease process. For example, of the four genes associated with abnormal fasting glucose levels in our data set, <italic>Slc16a2</italic> can be linked to <italic>Ldha</italic> via regulation of L-triiodothyronine (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Friesema et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), but the other two genes, <italic>Nsun2</italic> and <italic>Cyb561</italic>, have no reported regulatory links apart from in&#x000a0;vitro protein-protein interactions, so these represent candidates to investigate further. Already some broad conclusions can be drawn from the data set, such as the value of analyzing novel genes, the increased incidence of essentiality in genes with no paralog, and the increased number of genes required for male compared to female fertility. Many completely unexpected associations between genes and phenotypes have&#x000a0;been discovered, illustrating the value of a broad-based screen.</p><p>Another aspect of our study was the examination of heterozygous mutants, a genotype that often is not studied by individual laboratories. Although this was restricted to mutants that displayed lethality or subviability of homozygotes, it revealed a number of genes with haploinsufficiency, a feature commonly associated with mutations in the human genome but rarely described in mouse knockouts.</p><p>The tests used in screening varied considerably in their complexity, cost, and suitability in a high-throughput scenario. The performance of these tests across 250 alleles provided insight into those that should be included or excluded in the efforts to examine 5,000 alleles through the activities of the IMPC. Key considerations are variance in the control group, specificity, sensitivity, effect size, and redundancy.</p><p>The major contribution of null alleles will be an improved understanding of biological processes and molecular mechanisms of disease. The null allele will give insight into the temporal and spatial requirements for the gene and will contribute to the establishment of gene networks involved in mammalian disease processes. Furthermore, our data set demonstrates that many features of human Mendelian diseases can be found in the corresponding mouse mutant. The mouse alleles studied here are expected to be null alleles or strong hypomorphs, which may not always reflect the consequence of the human mutation. However, null alleles should reveal haploinsufficiency and recessive effects due to deleterious mutations such as frameshift and nonsense mutations. Null alleles in the mouse are likely to make the largest impact upon understanding human diseases caused by rare variants of large effect size. Complex multifactorial diseases, which may depend on human-specific variants with small effect size or more specific molecular effects such as gain-of-function mutations, will require more customized approaches such as knockin of specific human mutations. Alternative approaches using the mouse for discovering loci underlying complex disease include the Hybrid Mouse Diversity panel and the Collaborative Cross (reviewed by <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Flint and Eskin, 2012</xref>). These allow interrogation of many different loci simultaneously and study of epistatic interactions and can lead to identification of single gene variants causing disease (e.g., <xref rid="bib31 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Orozco et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Andreux et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), when variants affecting the trait of interest are present in the founders. ENU mutagenesis is another powerful technique that can be used to produce allelic series of mutations with differing effects upon function of single genes (e.g., <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). However, the null alleles that we describe here are a complement to these alternative approaches and will be invaluable for defining mechanisms of gene function on a standard genetic background.</p><p>The study described in this report builds on the large KOMP/EUCOMM resource of targeted mutations in mouse ES cells (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Skarnes et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) and illustrates the breadth of phenotypic information that can be garnered from an organized effort. The Clinical Phenotyping Pipeline optimized here has been adopted by several other programs within the IMPC; multiple groups are now working together to extend what is described in this report for 250 genes to 5,000 genes over the next 4 years with the vision that this will eventually cover all protein-coding genes. The primary phenotypes and genetic resources emerging from these programs will make a significant contribution to our understanding of mammalian gene function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice carrying knockout first conditional-ready alleles (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B) were generated from the KOMP/EUCOMM targeted ES cell resource using standard techniques.

Heatmap Showing Phenotypic Hits, Related to Figure&#x000a0;1</title><p>Heatmap of 250 genes, extracted from the public heatmap on Sanger Institute mouse portal. Each row represents the phenotype data from the assessed genotype, with red boxes indicating a hit, pale blue boxes indicating data falling within the reference range, and white boxes indicating that phenotyping was not completed. The key is at the top right of the table. Where a &#x02265; symbol occurs, clicking on the box will lead to further details of the data. Each data column represents a set of variables assessed using the indicated screening test, and a red box indicates that at least one variable in that test was classed as significant in either male or female groups or both.

Expanded Heatmap to Show All Variables Assessed and Gene Annotations, Related to Figure&#x000a0;1</title><p>In this heatmap, we expanded the columns to show one column for each variable scored in the phenotypic screening. Significant differences from the control baseline (hits) are shown by 1 and are shaded pink, unfilled boxes marked 0 indicate the results were not significantly different to controls, and a blank box shows the test was not done. A box is shaded pink if either the male, the female, or both groups show a significant difference. Missing data amounted to only 2.14% of the total. We assessed a total of 263 parameters, including 147 categorical variables and 116 quantitative variables. Further annotation of each mouse line and gene is included. Most are self-explanatory. (Column I) A line is classed as known if either there is a published mutant mouse allele on MGI, or as searched through Pubmed there is a paper published including the gene function or gene cloned in any species. A gene is classed as novel if the only publication is a high throughput or mapping paper or no publication. (Column U) For protein complex annotations, we took Entrez IDs of human homologs from the HMD_Human5.rpt table (from the MGI db) and checked whether these were in the CORUM database of known protein complexes. (Column Z) A line is classed as haploinsufficient (HI) if heterozygotes were screened and showed some phenotypic hits in addition to being lethal or sub-viable; A line is classed as essential (E) if homozygotes were either lethal or sub-viable; A line is classed as essential for fertility (EF) if the tested genotype showed fertility defects; A line is classed as non-essential (NE) if homozygotes show no phenotypic hits.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc3"><caption><title>Table S3.

We found 27/59 (45%) showed something consistent with the human disease, 21/59 (36%) where the mouse phenotype did not match the report of the human disease at all, and 11/59 (19%) where there appears to be a legitimate reason why we might not have seen something, for example, cases where the disease is recessive in humans but the mouse homozygotes are lethal and so we screened heterozygotes. In a number of cases (Column H) we detected phenotypes in the mouse that have not been reported in humans but may be worth looking for. For 26 genes, our findings represent the first mouse mutant reported, and these may serve as models for the respective human diseases.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc6.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc7"><caption><title>Table S7.

A minimum of 28 live progeny were required to assign viability status.

Of the 205 targeted alleles eligible for this recessive lethality screen, 143 are reported here. A total of 28 embryos were required to assign viability status, and outcomes were categorized by both the number and dysmorphology of homozygous offspring.</p><p>(D) A basic dysmorphology screen encompassing 12 parameters was performed on all embryos for the 75 targeted alleles classed as viable or subviable at E14.5. A total of 34 targeted alleles showed one or more abnormality, and the percentage incidence is presented.</p><p>(E&#x02013;G) Examples of E14.5 dysmorphology (arrowheads indicate abnormalities) are presented.

At least four independent 6-week-old mice of each sex were mated for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks, and if progeny were born, the line was classed as fertile, regardless of if the progeny survived to weaning. Of note is the strong skew toward male (blue circle) fertility issues (15 of 16 genes) compared to 4 of 15 genes that displayed female (red circle) fertility issues.</p><p>See also <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig><fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Data Distributions for Selected Parameters</p><p>(A&#x02013;F) Distribution of mean total cholesterol (A and B), mean HDL cholesterol (C and D), and mean LDL cholesterol (E and F) at 16&#x000a0;weeks of age in both sexes for 250 unique alleles.

The promotorless allele design is biased toward genes that are expressed in ES cells. The alleles are expected to be null alleles, but assessment of the degree of knockdown and the extent of off-target effects on nearby genes has not been carried out systematically.</p><p>(C) Genotyping and quality control of mice. <italic>ES cells</italic>: Long-range (LR) PCR, using one primer in the cassette and another outside of the homology arms of the allele design, was used to confirm the targeting on either the 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; side of the vector prior to micro-injection. <italic>Mice</italic>: To determine the genotype and confirm gene identity, three short-range PCR assays were used: mutant allele-specific, wild-type allele-specific and to detect the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene. Targeting was confirmed by either LRPCR, loss of the wild-type specific short-range PCR product in homozygotes or a qPCR assay confirming loss of the wild-type allele. Presence of the 3&#x02032; LoxP site was detected by either qPCR or short-range PCR assays. Further details of the QC protocols are available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knockoutmouse.org/kb/25/" id="intref0140">http://www.knockoutmouse.org/kb/25/</ext-link>. Initially mice were genotyped using a combination of the three short-range PCR assays, but to facilitate high-throughput, we later switched to a qPCR neo cassette counting-based system. Initial genotyping was carried out using ear punches from &#x0223c;14&#x000a0;day old mice, so that mice of the desired genotypes for screening could be identified and weaned together. Genotyping was repeated at the far-end of the pipeline after culling, and data were only accepted from mice for which the second genotype was concordant with the 14&#x000a0;day genotype.</p><p>(D) Genomic distribution of genes studied.
