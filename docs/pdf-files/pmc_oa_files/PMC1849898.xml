It was found that the nucleotide sequences of the signal peptides serve as an efficient downstream box to stimulate protein synthesis when they were fused upstream of the target genes. The extent of stimulation was critically affected by the identity of the second codons of the signal sequences. Moreover, the yield of the synthesized protein was enhanced by as much as 10 times in the presence of an optimal second codon. The signal peptides were <italic>in situ</italic> cleaved and the target proteins were produced in their native sizes by carrying out the cell-free synthesis reactions in the presence of Triton X-100, most likely through the activation of signal peptidase in the S30 extract. The amplification of the template DNA and the addition of the signal sequences were accomplished by PCR. Hence, elevated levels of recombinant proteins were generated within several hours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The cultivation of transformed cells has long been used as a standard route for preparing recombinant proteins. However, the recent explosion in the number of the newly identified open reading frames (ORFs) is now demanding a high throughput of protein expression that cannot be readily covered by the present <italic>in vivo</italic> expression technology.</p><p>Cell-free protein synthesis is attracting renewed attention as an alternative technique for overcoming the limited throughput of <italic>in vivo</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). While the conventional protocols of cell-free protein synthesis have been unable to provide sufficient quantities of proteins, recent improvements in the understanding of the key factors involved in cell-free synthesis have allowed the development of more efficient and robust protocols. Among the many attempts to enhance the accumulation of protein products in cell-free synthesis reactions, major improvements have been made through the stable supply of energy and substrates; ATP and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the stable maintenance of the magnesium concentration against accumulating phosphate is also essential for prolonging the reaction period of cell-free protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>However, the efficiency of gene expression is affected by the nature of the sequence elements as well as by environmental factors. Therefore, providing the optimal biochemical conditions is not sufficient for obtaining a high protein yield when the identity and arrangement of the nucleotide sequences have not been optimized for translation. In addition to the initiation codon and the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD) sequence, several other sequence elements surrounding the start codon affect the efficiency of translation initiation significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In particular, the sequence of the first few nucleotides in close proximity to the start codon (downstream box) has a profound effect on the translation efficiency of many transcripts.</p><p>In this study, it was found that many of the naturally occurring signal peptide sequences stimulate protein synthesis in a cell-free protein synthesis system derived from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. For example, when the nucleotide sequence of the OmpA signal peptide (<italic>ompA</italic>ss) was fused with the target genes, the amounts of the cell-free synthesized proteins were enhanced 10 times. The effectiveness of the different signal sequences were compared in a rapid and parallel manner through the PCR-based generation of the DNA templates for cell-free protein synthesis. As a result, it was found that the stimulatory effect of a signal peptide sequence was dependent on the identity of its second codon, and that most of the effective nucleotide sequences have an AAA triplet at the +2 position.</p><p>Finally, the &#x02018;open&#x02019; nature of the cell-free protein synthesis enabled the <italic>in situ</italic> removal of the signal peptide from the expressed proteins. All the expression products were found at the native size of the target protein using the cell-free protein synthesis reactions in the presence of Triton X-100, most likely through the activation of the endogenous signal peptidase.</p><p>The method presented in this report enables the parallel expression of authentic proteins at elevated levels, and will provide a valuable platform for the large-scale translation of genomic information into protein molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP, creatine phosphate, creatine kinase and the <italic>E.coli</italic> total tRNA mixture were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN).

For example, in reactions utilizing creatine phosphate for the continuous regeneration of ATP, the use of an excess amount of creatine phosphate enabled prolonged protein synthesis provided that the reaction mixture was supplied periodically with fresh magnesium ions to compensate for their loss through the formation of insoluble magnesium phosphates. Using this approach, as much as 1.2 mg/ml of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) could be produced from a single batch reaction of cell-free protein synthesis. An increase in the productivity of many other proteins was also shown after improving the supply of ATP and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>However, the provision of optimal biochemical conditions does not always enhance the productivity of cell-free protein synthesis. For example, the expression level of hEPO was not affected significantly in the presence of the elevated levels of ATP and amino acids, and remained at &#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;g/ml. Since all of our ORFs were routinely cloned in the same expression vectors (pK7 and pIVEX2.3d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), such a discrepancy would be due to the nature of the nucleotide sequences of the structural genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Signal peptide sequences-mediated stimulation of protein expression</title><p>With respect to the effect of the sequence elements on the efficiency of gene expression, many recent reports strongly suggest that the translational efficiency of a gene is determined primarily by the nature of the initial nucleotide sequences. For example, Stenstr&#x000f6;m and Isaksson recently demonstrated that the translational efficiency of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene was critically affected by the identity of the first +2 to +5 codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In particular, the expression level was dramatically changed according to which codon was placed at the +2 position. While the expression level of the reporter gene was strongly stimulated when the AAA codon was located at +2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the placement of the NGG codons (CGG, AGG, GGG and UGG) at the same position was associated with remarkably lower expression efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Based on their results, it was assumed that the yields of otherwise poorly expressed genes might be stimulated by placing the optimal nucleotide sequences beforehand. It was also expected that such a stimulatory sequence could be used as a universal translation enhancer to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins. In search of the nucleotide sequences that possibly enhance the expression of their fusion partners, the python script was used to analyze the codon usage in the entire <italic>E.coli</italic> genome. Interestingly, it was found that the nucleotide sequences of many signal peptides had strong bias for AAA as the second codon. Approximately 40% of signal peptides had the AAA triplet as the second codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Codon biases of the nucleotide sequence of the <italic>E.coli</italic> signal peptides</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequence data</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency of AAA codon at position +2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Whole <italic>E.coli</italic> K12 genome</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">440/4241 (10.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unverified <italic>E.coli</italic> signal sequences</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22/45 (48.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Verified <italic>E.coli</italic> signal sequences</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/54 (29.6%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><italic>E.coli</italic> signal sequence data set were obtained from a signal peptide database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.bic.nus.edu.sg/spdb/"/>).

It was also suggested that the higher frequency of the AAA triplet at the +2 position is related to the translation efficiency of a gene. Therefore, from the exceptionally high frequency of the AAA triplet as the second codon, it was assumed that the signal sequences might work as a translation-enhancing element.</p><p>Therefore, the genes of hEPO with different signal sequences were fused and experiments were carried out to determine if their presence affects the efficiency of protein synthesis in our cell-free synthesis system.

system</title><p>Although it was shown that the presence of <italic>ompA</italic>ss dramatically enhances the expression of the recombinant proteins, it also adds 21 non-native amino acid residues to the target proteins that might interfere with the biological functions and proper folding of the expressed proteins. Therefore, it would be desirable if the signal peptides are removed during protein synthesis so that the resulting polypeptide of the target protein follows its natural folding pathway. Since the reactions of cell-free protein synthesis are carried out in a crude lysate of <italic>E.coli</italic> (S30 extract), it was presumed that most of the soluble <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins are present in the reaction mixture. In addition, the signal peptidase of <italic>E.coli</italic> retains its activity even when it is detached from the cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Therefore, the added signal peptide should be removed <italic>in situ</italic> by the endogenous signal peptidase activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blot analyses confirmed that a significant proportion of the cell-free expressed protein had the native size without the signal peptide. This indicates that the S30 extract retains the signal peptidase activity under the reaction conditions for cell-free protein synthesis.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>In situ</italic> cleavage of the signal peptides during cell-free protein synthesis. (<bold>A</bold>) The indicated concentration of Triton X-100 was added to the reaction mixture from the start of the synthesis reaction, and examined to determine it could increase the level of signal peptide cleavage. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the soluble and pellet fractions were analyzed by 13% Tricine-SDS&#x02013;PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (upper panel) and western blot using the anti-EPO antibody (lower panel). P and S represent the insoluble and soluble fractions of the cell-free synthesized EPO, respectively.

By taking advantage of the &#x02018;open&#x02019; nature of cell-free protein synthesis, an attempt was made to express the <italic>ompA</italic>ss-hEPO construct in the presence of Triton X-100 with the anticipation that the enhanced signal peptidase activity would increase the fraction of the correctly sized product. Indeed, the efficiency of the cleavage of signal peptide was improved remarkably upon the addition of Triton X-100, and virtually all the products were found at the correct molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When tested at different concentrations, the presence of Triton X-100 &#x0003e;0.1% (w/v) effectively facilitated the removal of the <italic>OmpA</italic> sequence, and virtually all of the cell-free expressed products were found at the native size of EPO. At least up to the concentration of 0.5% (w/v), the presence of Triton X-100 did not affect the efficiency of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, enhanced efficiency of the cleavage of the signal sequence was not due to a reduced yield of protein synthesis. In addition, solubility of the cell-free expressed products was substantially enhanced in the presence of Triton X-100. While the EPO molecules (regardless of the presence of signal sequences) were almost completely insoluble in the reaction mixture without any detergents, &#x0223c;70% of the expressed protein was found in the soluble fraction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, it was found that the nucleotide sequences of signal peptides could serve as efficient downstream boxes to stimulate protein synthesis. When analyzed in a cell-free protein synthesis system derived from <italic>E.coli</italic>, different target genes showed increases in protein expression of 2.3- to 32-fold through their fusion with the nucleotide sequences of the signal peptides. The stimulatory effect of the signal sequences appeared to be closely related to the presence of the AAA triplet at the +2 position.</p><p>Based on this discovery, a method was developed to rapidly generate authentic protein molecules at elevated levels. First, overlap extension PCR techniques were used to amplify the target genes in the fused form with the nucleotide sequence of signal peptide. The amplified DNA was then used to direct protein synthesis, and protein molecules were generated within several hours. In addition, by mimicking the <italic>in vivo</italic> process of the signal peptide cleavage, the target proteins were produced in their native amino acid sequences without additional signal peptides.</p><p>Although the detailed mechanism of the signal sequence-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis is not completely understood, it appears that the effect of the initial nucleotide sequences is not related to the relative abundance or stability of the mRNA species. Computational analyses of the mRNA structure did not indicate any notable difference caused by the presence of these signal sequences. In addition, among the gene constructs examined in this study, the relative level of mRNA with or without the signal sequence was similar (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the initial nucleotide sequence affects the process of translation initiation and/or the early phase of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In particular, Gonzalez de Valdivia and Isaksson demonstrated that the presence of NGG triplets in the early coding region causes inefficient translation through an accelerated drop-off of peptidyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Although extensive evidence has been presented that entire codon context in the early coding region (from positions +2 to +5) influence gene expression, the presence of additional AAA triplet at the positions +3 to +5 of <italic>ompT</italic>ss did not further increase the yield of protein synthesis in our experiments (data not shown). However, still, it might be of worth to note that some of the effective signal sequences have additional AAA triplet in the early coding region (e.g. <italic>malE</italic>ss and <italic>ompC</italic>ss have an additional AAA triplet at +4 position). It might be possible to further improve the effectiveness of the signal sequences by engineering the nucleotide sequences in this region. Apart from the precise mechanism of action, the use of signal sequences as a translation-enhancing downstream box offers distinctive advantages in cell-free protein synthesis. In addition to the remarkably enhanced expression level of the target proteins, the <italic>in situ</italic> cleavage of the signal peptides provides a simple way for removing the N-terminal methionine. The issue of removing the translation initiator, N-formyl-methionine or methionine, from a recombinant protein is often critical for obtaining active and stable recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>It is believed that these results can be further extended to controlling the expression level of genes. Using the signal sequences that have been engineered to stimulate protein synthesis at different efficiencies, a mixture of template DNA can be co-expressed to generate the proteins in the desired abundances. Such a system will provide an ideal platform for constructing an <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolic network. As demonstrated by Ku <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), the <italic>in vitro</italic> reproduction of a metabolic pathway can be ideally used to further understand and optimize the production of metabolites.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, Korea (grant No. 10021962).
