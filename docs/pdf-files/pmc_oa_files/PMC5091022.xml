Substantial bleeding can occur in the subcutaneous and intra-articular space after TKR; this event can lead to blood transfusions, with their potential complications.<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Drainage is commonly used with the theoretical purpose of preventing hematomas, which, in turn, may decrease joint mobility and reduce local tissue perfusion, increasing the possibility of infection. Thus, drains can also be used to lower the risk of infection and prevent healing delay in TKR.<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Primary TKR can lead to a reduction in the erythrocyte levels. Various strategies have been used in order to reduce the need for blood products, such as tourniquet placed at the thigh root, coagulation diathermy, knee position, clamped drains, infiltration with vasoconstrictor solutions, antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid, Floseal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), and computer-assisted surgeries.<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>The use of suction drains (SD) in arthroplasties is still controversial. It is believed that the drainage is limited only to a restricted area, failing to prevent infection if retrograde migration of bacteria occurs. Drains can also hamper rehabilitation in the immediate postoperative period. There is no obvious advantage of using SDs, other than lower need for dressing changes during surgery; moreover, in patients undergoing TKR with SDs, the risk of transfusion is higher.<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>With the aging population, there has been increasing demand for joint replacements, which are effective methods to improve the quality of life with recovery of movement and improvement in pain, although these surgeries cause large blood loss and lead to dramatic consequences in patients with chronic illnesses; in prosthesis revision surgeries, the losses may be higher.

These values were considered as controls; patients were weighed in kilograms and their height was measured in centimeters.</p><p>Patients underwent spinal anesthesia and received a prophylactic dose of antibiotics &#x02013; cefazolin 2&#x000a0;g &#x02013; by the anesthesiologist. A pneumatic tourniquet was applied on the root of the thigh of the limb to be operated, with a pressure of 300&#x000a0;mmHg for all patients. Surgical technique adopted was the standard TKR with joint access <italic>via</italic> a classic trans-quadriceps approach and patellar eversion. Authors&#x02019; routine is the use of intramedullary guides for femoral cuts and extramedullary guides for tibial cuts. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was resected in all procedures. The patella was not resurfaced, and was prepared in all cases as follows: after local denervation and synovectomy, to avoid clunk syndrome, the patella was eburnated and neurotized, and a lateral fasciotomy was performed. The prosthesis used was the AKS Modular Bloqueada<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Baumer, Mogi Miring, SP, Brazil), a non-PCL-sparing prosthesis. Portovac SDs of 3.2&#x000a0;mm and 4.8&#x000a0;mm were placed in the joint space before capsular closure. In order to standardize the drainage area, all the ends of the drains were cut so that they were 10&#x000a0;cm long in the joint and the lateral recess. The Portovac drain is a post-operative polyethylene closed drainage system, whose resistance is designed for a continuous and mild suction. It has a vacuum pump with a capacity of 500&#x000a0;mL, with an attachment cord, an intermediate section made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a clamp, a two- or three-way connector, and a drainage catheter with a surgical-grade stainless steel needle (3.2&#x000a0;mm, 4.8&#x000a0;mm, or 6.4&#x000a0;mm), used to puncture the drain passage site.<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> After wound closure, an inguinal-malleolar compressive occlusive Robert Jones dressing was applied. If surgery lasted over 2&#x000a0;h, the tourniquet was deflated and the ischemia was released; subsequently, hemostasis was assessed, inserting drains, sutures, and dressings. All surgeries were always performed by the principal investigator or under his direct assistance. Blood loss was measured though serial Hb and Ht counts at 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;h (the last measurement was considered as the Hb-post and Ht-post) and through blood volume, serially measured on the SD at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48&#x000a0;h after the end of the surgical procedure. In this last measurement, the SD was removed and dressing was changed. The surgeon was not involved in the measurement of SD volumes. All patients received thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin sodium at a dose of 40&#x000a0;mg subcutaneous 6&#x000a0;h after the procedure, administered once a day for 15 days.

Goes et al.<xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> compared the laboratory results of opening the drain at six and 12&#x000a0;h after TKR, and did not observe statistically significant differences in laboratory values. However, the volume of drained blood was higher when the drain was opened after 6&#x000a0;h. Those authors only used 4.8-mm drains. Roy et al.<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> conducted a study with immediate drain opening 1&#x000a0;h after the end of surgery; they observed blood loss and increased need for blood products in the group where the drain was opened immediately. These authors did not mention the thickness of the drain; they stated that two access routes were placed in the joint space and were removed after 48&#x000a0;h.</p><p>It was observed that the bleeding after 24&#x000a0;h becomes insignificant; in 1991, Willemen et al.<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> concluded that the clinical evaluations of surgical wound healing were similar for all groups (drain removed after 24 and 48&#x000a0;h) and clearly showed no advantage in continuing use of the drain after 24&#x000a0;h; if drainage is maintained for a longer period, there is an increased risk of bacterial contamination. 85% of the total volume was drained during the first 24&#x000a0;h; in the following 24&#x000a0;h, an average of only 50&#x000a0;mL of blood was drained, but the authors did not mention the gauge of the drains. Drinkwater and Neil<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> recommend that drains in hip or knee replacements should also be removed after 24&#x000a0;h.</p><p>Beer et al.,<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> in their classical publication from 1991, went further, demonstrating that there is no difference regarding the incidence of edema or persistent draining through the wound. The return to active quadriceps function and knee range of motion in patients who underwent TKR was also not affected by the use of SDs. They concluded that the routine use of drains in uncomplicated surgery is unnecessary. Similarly, Zhang et al.,<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> in a meta-analysis published in 2014, concluded that, for primary surgery without major complications, it is preferable to not use SDs; the surgeon should assess the benefits and drawbacks. In the present study, there was only one complication (blisters) in the 4.8-mm SD group.</p><p>Andrade et al.,<xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> in a Brazilian publication that compared the use or non-use of 3.2-mm SDs, came to the conclusion that, beyond six months post-operative, there is no benefit in the use of closed SD in TKR. However, range of motion at the end of the first month was better in the group that used SD.</p><p>In the present study, bleeding was higher within the first 6&#x000a0;h after surgery for both groups, as the drains remained open. Yildiz et al.<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> took into account the clamping of the drain for 6&#x000a0;h after TKR and observed that, in the group in which the tourniquet was released after the sutures and bandages were applied and the drain was closed for 6&#x000a0;h, there was less blood loss. Souza Le&#x000e3;o et al.<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> did not take into account clamping of the SD in TKR, and compared blood loss with early or late release of the tourniquet; they found no statistically significant differences in bleeding, but there was no mention of the diameter of the drains. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels also were similar for both groups.</p><p>In a recent meta-analysis, Li at al.<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> concluded that, through the current evidence, the use or non-use of SDs has similar utility and clinical significance in primary TKR. However, due to some limitations (few patients involved in each study and only three randomized controlled trials), their findings should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, future studies of high methodological quality and long-term follow-up are necessary to update the meta-analysis, in order to better assess the importance and effectiveness of the use of drains.</p><p>It is well established that the total number of hip replacements, and especially TKRs, will increase over the next 25 years.<xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> These operations are known to have a high volume of blood loss; however, it is difficult to compare the amount of these losses given the fact that many different formulas are used to calculate losses. A precise method for calculating estimated blood loss in joint replacements is essential for a better assessment of the perioperative losses estimates. With this in mind, in 1996 Mercuriali and Inghilleri<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> developed an algorithm to calculate probable losses and the need for blood transfusions. This formula is based on preoperative hematocrit (Ht-pre) and hematocrit on the fifth postoperative day (Ht-post). The hematocrit should be written in decimal units. This formula requires the patient's blood volume to be calculated by the formula postulated by Nadler at al.<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> (in milliliters of blood) and also requires the volume of blood (red blood cells) transfused. The estimate obtained by the Mercuriali formula is given in milliliters of red blood cells.</p><p>The limiting factors of the present study include the small follow-up time (only during admission), in which no differences were observed in joint function and the rate of infection; other complications were not the object of this study, which probably would show further advantages of one method over the other and could abound for further research. Pain was also not quantified. A sample with a larger number of patients would provide more robustness to the statistical analysis. As patients were on the first three days of intravenous hydration and blood count also depends on the hydration status, perhaps numbers were higher than the noted, proving the low use of blood products; however, a theoretical framework that takes into account the hydration of patients was not retrieved. A group without SD &#x02013; control &#x02013; would be ideal to compare the blood count and the estimated blood loss, and hence justify the use or non-use of SD.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present data allows for the conclusion that patients undergoing TKR have higher bleeding when they have a 4.8-mm SD inserted. Estimated blood loss is similar, regardless of the thickness of the drains used. Bleeding is higher in the first 24&#x000a0;h after surgery, especially in the first 6&#x000a0;h; during the last 24&#x000a0;h, bleeding is negligible, and therefore the use of the drain is unnecessary. Reduction in hematocrit was similar for both groups and was more pronounced on the first day, remaining stable thereafter. Bleeding through SD in TKR is a reality that cannot be underestimated; the surgeon should be aware of possible complications of this event and promptly resolve it. Rational use of the drain and choice of its gauge are at the surgeon's discretion, bearing in mind that thicker drains can cause increased bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><title>Conflicts of
