In this work, we demonstrate that silver nanoparticles undergo a size-dependent interaction with herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and with human parainfluenza virus type 3. We show that production of silver nanoparticles from different fungi is feasible, and their antiviral activity is dependent on the production system used. Silver nanoparticles are capable of reducing viral infectivity, probably by blocking interaction of the virus with the cell, which might depend on the size and zeta potential of the silver nanoparticles. Smaller-sized nanoparticles were able to inhibit the infectivity of the viruses analyzed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>silver nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>herpes simplex virus</kwd><kwd>parainfluenza virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The world population faces the problem of viral infection and the various life-threatening diseases caused by different viruses, such as the common cold, influenza, hepatitis, chickenpox, infectious mononucleosis, herpes keratitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and viral encephalitis. Much effort has been made to develop medicines and vaccines against a number of viruses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-8-4303">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijn-8-4303">2</xref> Although tremendous improvement has been made from time to time in the field of antiviral therapy, medicines are unable to completely prevent all viral disease. Hence, it is essential to develop antiviral agents which can act against a broad range of viruses. Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) are important viruses because they can cause serious infection in humans.</p><p>Despite the continued global epidemic of herpes simplex virus and extensive research, there have been few major breakthroughs in the treatment or prevention of this virus since the introduction of aciclovir in the 1980s. Resistance of herpes simplex virus to aciclovir has become an important clinical problem, especially in immunocompromised patients undergoing long-term therapy. Viral resistance to aciclovir usually arises from mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene, although mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene may also occur. Resistant isolates can cause severe, progressive, and debilitating mucosal disease and, rarely, visceral dissemination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-8-4303">3</xref> Available reports suggest that infection caused by these viruses can be avoided to some extent by inhibiting their DNA replication. The phenolic compounds extracted from rosemary, a spice plant (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L), avoid HSV-1 infection in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, thereby inhibiting replication of viral DNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-8-4303">4</xref> Hashem et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijn-8-4303">5</xref> investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid, a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid-processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. Analysis carried out by neutral red assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that aurintricarboxylic acid reduced viral replication to a considerable extent.</p><p>Modifications of existing antiviral compounds and development of novel antiviral agents is a prime area of research. Nanotechnology provides a golden platform to modify and develop the properties of pure metals by converting them into their nanoform (nanoparticles), which has applications in numerous fields like diagnostics, drug delivery, antimicrobial agents, and treatment of various other diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijn-8-4303">6</xref> In particular, nanotechnology represents a novel challenge for the treatment of viral infection.</p><p>Metal nanoparticles can be synthesized by physical, chemical, and biological methods. The latter technique has demonstrated many advantages over physical and chemical methods.

Their results demonstrated that AgNPs approximately 10 nm in size significantly inhibit Monkeypox virus infection in vitro, supporting their potential use as a therapeutic antiviral agent. Speshock et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-8-4303">28</xref> demonstrated the interaction of AgNPs with Tacaribe virus and their effect on viral replication. In particular, virus treated with AgNPs showed significant reduction in viral RNA production and release of progeny virus, which supports the view that AgNPs are capable of inhibiting Tacaribe virus infection in vitro.

Moreover, the noble properties exhibited by the nanoparticles are due to their nanosize; by forming an aggregate, the size of the particle changes, thereby changing its properties. Zeta potential measurements for all samples synthesized from the five different fungi were recorded.

These values confirm full stabilization of the nanoparticles and the fact that the chances of aggregation are very low because of their narrow size distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxicity studies</title><p>To rule out the possibility that the reduction of infectivity could be caused by cellular toxicity, monolayers of Vero cells were incubated with different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL) of each different type of AgNPs for different time points (1, 3, 10, 24, and 36 hours) and cell viability was quantified by the MTT assay (data not shown). Nanoparticles produced by the <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species had toxic effects after 10 hours of incubation in the concentration range of 5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;g/mL, while nanoparticles produced in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, and <italic>C. indicum</italic> showed very minor cytotoxicity in Vero cells. We did not observe a decrease in cell viability up to 50 &#x003bc;g/mL for nanoparticles produced in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>C. indicum</italic>. These data were important for deciding on the concentrations to be tested in the antiviral assays. We used concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 &#x003bc;g/mL, therefore well below the level at which cytotoxic effects were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of antiviral activity</title><p>In order to determine the extent of antiviral activity and elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we tested AgNPs under different conditions to identify the step in the entry process that may be inhibited by the different nanoparticles. To test whether AgNPs can affect HSV-1, HSV-2 and HPIV-3 infectivity in vitro, we used a cotreatment assay in which the different AgNPs of interest and viruses were concomitantly added to the cell culture in order to have both of them present during and after viral adsorption. The extent of HSV-1, HSV-2, and HPIV-3 replication was assessed by plaque titration after addition of carboxymethyl cellulose.</p><p>The results showed a consistent decrease in replication efficiency for HSV-1 and HPIV-3, and a minor effect on the replication of HSV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-8-4303">Figure 4</xref>). AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> species and <italic>Phoma</italic> species were shown to be toxic at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, the results for this concentration in the antiviral test are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-8-4303">Figure 4B</xref>, given that we were not able to determine a reliable viral titer. Also, the inhibition at 5 mg/mL was not reliable even though we could score plaques. The inhibition observed with AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> species and <italic>Phoma</italic> species was quite low (between 0% and 40%) with the three viruses at the lower concentrations, so we can conclude that the AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species are not efficient in reducing viral infectivity. In contrast, AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>C. indicum</italic> showed the strongest inhibitory activity, especially toward HSV-1 and HPIV-3. The dose-dependent reduction in virus infectivity can reach 80% inhibition with AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> when challenged with HSV-1, and 90% inhibition with AgNPs produced by <italic>C. indicum</italic> when challenged with HPIV-3. The results observed when using AgNPs produced by <italic>Curvularia</italic> species showed that these nanoparticles have inhibitory activity comparable with that of AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>C. indicum</italic> in the case of HSV-1, but almost no inhibitory activity when HPIV-3 was used as the viral challenge.</p><p>We further explored the potential of AgNPs to interfere with early penetration. Vero cells were pretreated with the different AgNPs for 1 hour before infection. None of the AgNPs had any inhibitory effect at the concentrations tested on any of the viruses under investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-8-4303">Figure 5</xref>). This result implies that the AgNPs do not interfere with the cell membrane or early penetration steps of virus entry.</p><p>Because inhibition of viral infectivity could be due to a consequence of the action of AgNPs inside the cell at a post-entry event, we performed a &#x0201c;post-treatment&#x0201d; test by adding the AgNPs at different concentrations 2 hours after virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-8-4303">Figure 6</xref>). Again, AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species were ineffective as antiviral agents and showed unreliable results due to residual toxicity, while AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, and <italic>C. indicum</italic> inhibited the infectivity of the three viruses under study in a dose-dependent manner at levels slightly lower than the ones obtained in the cotreatment assay. Replication of the viruses seemed to be inhibited when the virus and nanoparticles were present on the cell at the same time and therefore during the post-attachment step, and also when the virus had already entered the cells. The latter effect could be due to interference with the replication machinery inside the cells or be a limitation of cell-to-cell spread of viruses after the first replication cycle.</p><p>Since inhibition of virus penetration might result from irreversible AgNP-induced inactivation of virions, the possibility that the nanoparticles could interfere with HSV particles and inactivate viral infectivity was explored. To do this, viral aliquots were incubated with different concentrations of the different AgNPs for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. After incubation, the samples were diluted to reduce the concentrations of the antiviral agent well below the threshold for the resulting viral inhibition, and the infectivity of the preincubated virions was measured by titration on cell monolayers. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-8-4303">Figure 7</xref>, incubation of virions with the AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, and <italic>C. indicum</italic> reduced the infectivity in a dose-dependent manner for the three viruses analyzed. A higher level of inhibition was observed with AgNPs from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>C. indicum</italic>. AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species (not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-8-4303">Figure 7</xref>) confirmed their toxicity toward membrane envelopes, and no plaques were scored, resulting in 100% inhibition of infectivity. In the present assay, the inoculum is diluted to a concentration where the amount of AgNPs is markedly reduced under the active concentration. Therefore, we did not observe any toxicity on the cell monolayers, but we can assume that the viral membranes may have been severely impaired and the viruses were unable to infect cells. The results of the virus pretreatment assay show that the nanoparticles also have a virucidal effect.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that production of AgNPs from different fungi is feasible, and their antiviral activity is dependent on the production system used. Some of the fungal strains used in the present study resulted in the production of AgNPs with considerable toxicity which prevents their use as antivirals; but some of them, ie, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, and <italic>C.</italic> indicum, indeed have low toxicity levels and promising antiviral activity. The three viruses investigated belong to the Herpesviridae and Paramyxoviridae families, and all are surrounded by a lipid envelope with embedded viral-encoded glycoproteins. Their mechanism of penetration into cells presents several common features; nevertheless they present profound differences in the structural organization of fusion glycoproteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ijn-8-4303">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ijn-8-4303">46</xref> AgNPs have shown antiviral efficacy against several viruses regardless of the specific structural details of each single family, so may provide the opportunity for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Nonenveloped viruses are also putative targets of AgNPs, since their exposed capsid surfaces are constituted by proteins that serve as receptor-binding molecules, but no relevant data are as yet available in the literature. AgNPs are able to reduce viral infectivity when added concomitantly with the virus inocula, probably by blocking interaction of the virus with the cell. AgNPs may block an early event before stable binding of the virus with the cell membrane, but it is likely that the nanoparticles interact directly with the viral envelope or its proteins and behave as virucidal agents. In fact, a virus pretreatment assay showed that AgNPs produced in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, and <italic>C. indicum</italic> reduced viral infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. Cell pretreatment did not have any measurable effect at the concentration used, so the nanoparticles were not able to clog the receptor sites or the cell surface. The most interesting feature was the interference with replication at the post-entry phase.</p><p>From the present study it was observed that AgNPs were capable of controlling viral infectivity, most likely by blocking interaction of the virus with the cell, which might be dependent on the size and zeta potential of the AgNPs. With regard to the influence of size on antiviral activity, it was observed that AgNPs produced by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, having a size of 4&#x02013;13 nm and 5&#x02013;23 nm, respectively, had better antiviral activity (80%&#x02013;90% inhibition) against HSV-1 and HPIV-3 viruses and were less cytotoxic to Vero cells. In contrast, AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species, with a size range of 7&#x02013;20 nm, showed less antiviral activity; therefore, AgNPs having a smaller size were able to inhibit replication of the viruses analyzed in this study.</p><p>Nanoparticle tracking analysis also revealed that the average size of AgNPs produced by <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species were 46 nm and 40 nm, respectively; however, AgNPs synthesized by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Curvularia</italic> species were 20 nm and 30 nm, respectively, having a smaller size than the former AgNPs. There might also be an impact of zeta potential on antiviral activity. <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Curvularia</italic> species produced stable AgNPs with zeta potential values of &#x02212;32.9 mV and &#x02212;22.1 m V, respectively, which showed greater antiviral activity. <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Phoma</italic> species also produced AgNPs having a greater zeta potential, but had a larger particle size and therefore less antiviral activity.</p><p>The present findings corroborate the findings of Elechiguerra et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ijn-8-4303">47</xref> who confirmed that smaller-sized AgNPs could attach to a virus, inhibiting the virus from attaching to host cells and ultimately resulting in attenuation of viral replication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Luca De Luca for technical assistance.
