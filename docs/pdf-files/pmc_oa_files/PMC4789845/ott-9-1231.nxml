However, the function and mechanism of miR-381 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In the present study, the miR-381 expression was assessed in a cohort of 113 CRC specimens using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR), which demonstrated that miR-381 was significantly downregulated in CRC and correlated with distant metastasis and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage. Functional study revealed that restoration of miR-381 significantly inhibited the invasion, migration, and epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. Luciferase reporter assay validated that Twist1, an important EMT inducer, was a direct target of miR-381, and rescued Twist1 attenuated the function of miR-381 in CRC cells. Correlation analysis also revealed an inverse correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression levels in CRC specimens. Taken together, our results highlight the significance of miR-381/Twist1 interaction in the development and progression of CRC, and suggest that restoration of miR-381 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with CRC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>miR-381</kwd><kwd>twist family bHLH transcription factor 1</kwd><kwd>Twist1</kwd><kwd>epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant and leading causes of cancers worldwide.<xref rid="b1-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although there has been substantial progress in the treatment for patients with CRC, approximately half of them die within 5 years, mainly due to metastasis;<xref rid="b3-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> thus, further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms is of great clinical significance.

Using TargetScan and miRanda tools online, we screened several invasion- and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in cell invasion and migration ability,<xref rid="b24-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ott-9-1231" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and hence we focused on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets Twist1 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-9-1231">Figure 3A</xref>), luciferase reporter assays were performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type Twist1 3&#x02032;UTR reporter, but had no effect on the Twist1 3&#x02032;UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-9-1231">Figure 3B</xref>).

To confirm the interaction of miR-381 and Twist1 in CRC, we performed RTq-PCR on Twist1 expression in CRC tissues and found a significant inverse correlation between their expression levels in clinical CRC. In addition, functional study revealed that Twist1 knockdown significantly inhibited the invasion and migration ability of HT29 and SW480 cells, and rescued Twist1 in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells dramatically attenuated miR-381-induced inhibition on cellular migration and invasion.

(<bold>C</bold>) HT29 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-381 mimics (miR-381) or scrambled mimics as negative control (miR-NC) were cotransfected with Twist1 expression plasmids lacking 3&#x02032;UTR (miR-381 + Twist1, miR-NC + Twist1) or empty pCDNA3.1 vector (miR-381 + pCDNA3.1, miR-NC + pCDNA3.1). Transwell with matrigel assays and wound healing assays were performed to investigate the invasion and migration ability of CRC cells, respectively. (<bold>D</bold>) Western blot was performed to examine the effects of miR-381 overexpression only (miR-381 + pCDNA3.1), rescued Twist1 only (miR-NC + Twist1), combined miR-381 overexpression with rescued Twist1 (miR-381 + Twist1), and negative control (miR-NC + pCDNA3.1) on EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) in HT29 cells. *<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> CRC, colorectal cancer; UTR, untranslated region; EMT, epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ott-9-1231Fig4"/></fig><table-wrap id="t1-ott-9-1231" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The relationship between miR-381 expression and clinicopathologic features of 113 patients used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">Clinicopathological parameters</th><th rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">No of cases</th><th colspan="2" valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1">miR-381 expression
