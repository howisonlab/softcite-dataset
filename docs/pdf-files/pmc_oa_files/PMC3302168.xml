Concurrent with the increase in the incidence of obesity is an increase in the incidence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). It has been reported that over 80&#x00025; of adults diagnosed with T2D are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The connection between obesity and the development of T2D has been the focus of intense research in recent years. It has been demonstrated that a low-grade, systemic inflammation originating from adipose tissue is one of the factors associated with systemic insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Adipose tissue secretes numerous adipokines, which have been shown to affect whole body's insulin sensitivity and dysregulation of the secretion of these factors could contribute to the development of insulin resistance in obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Also, excess fatty acids released from the adipocytes of obese persons contribute to ectopic fat storage in non-adipose tissues such as liver and muscle, exacerbating their insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate intracellular signaling in many different cell types by degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> There are currently 21 genes, which code for distinct PDE enzymes. The enzymes can be further divided, based on sequence and chemical properties, into 11 different families denoted PDE1-11.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> PDEs are expressed in virtually all cell types in the body and have specific roles in the regulation of diverse biological functions by controlling discrete pools of cyclic nucleotides. Inhibitors to specific PDE families, such as PDE3 and PDE5 inhibitors, are currently used in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p><p>In adipocytes, the ability of insulin to antagonize cAMP-induced lipolysis is mainly due to insulin-induced activation of PDE3B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> PDE3B has also been shown to have a role in calcium-induced anti-lipolysis in human adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> PDE3B has a central role in the regulation of not only lipolysis but also other biological functions in adipocytes such as lipogenesis and glucose uptake, as evidenced by studies with PDE3B-deficient mice and PDE3 inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> PDE4 is another PDE, which is highly expressed in adipocytes. There are four different isoforms of PDE4, which have been shown to be expressed in rodent adipocytes;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> however, there is little known about their function in adipocytes. A deletion mutant mouse model of one PDE4 isoform suggests a potential role in metabolic homeostasis. Mice deficient in PDE4B show reduced body weight and reduced adipose tissue mass compared with wild-type animals, and are resistant to high-fat diet-induced weight gain and adipose tissue inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Although PDE3B and PDE4 isoforms appear to comprise most of the PDE activity in rodent adipocytes, the activity of other PDEs in adipocytes and adipose tissue have been described. Calcium-inducible (PDE1) and cGMP inducible (PDE2) PDE activities have been identified in rat adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> PDE5A has been studied in differentiated human adipocytes, but its expression decreases as adipocytes mature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> The mRNA expression level of a number of PDE family members has been recently determined in a number of rat tissues, including adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Among the PDEs expressed were PDE9A, PDE10A and PDE11A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> The protein regulation and biological function of these PDEs in adipose tissue are not known at this time, however, there are indications that some of these enzymes contribute to the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis. Deletion mutant mouse models of PDE9A and PDE10A display reduced body weight or reduced adipose tissue mass compared with wild-type mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup></p><p>Although there have been previous reports to changes in PDE activity in subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> to date there have been no thorough investigations of PDE expression and activities in different human adipose tissue depots. In this study, we investigated PDE expression and activities in human adipose tissue. We further compared the activities of PDEs in different adipose tissue depots in non-obese and obese subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with scheduled gastrointestinal surgeries at Sk&#x000e5;ne University Hospital were recruited by the surgeons involved in the study. Adipose tissue biopsy samples, weighing 0.25&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;g, were obtained from patients undergoing bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy operations. The criterion for acceptance for bariatric surgery was morbid obesity defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. In this study, patients with a BMI&#x02a7e;30 were considered obese and BMI&#x0003c;30 were considered non-obese. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy samples were obtained from the abdomen and visceral adipose tissue biopsy samples were obtained from the greater omentum in each patient after informed consent was given. Patients were not excluded for any conditions and a detailed accounting of all pre-existing conditions and medications taken by the patients was kept for reference. All experiments were approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden.</p></sec><sec><title>Adipocyte isolation</title><p>Human adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Adipocytes were diluted in Krebs&#x02013;Ringer buffer containing 25&#x02009;m Hepes, 200&#x02009;n adenosine, 2&#x02009;m glucose and 1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin.

The total PDE activity is the sum of the activities of several different PDE enzyme families. Selective inhibitors to PDE3 and PDE4 family enzymes were used to identify PDE3 and PDE4 activities in adipose tissues. In SC adipose tissue, there was a negative correlation between PDE3 activity and BMI, which was the strongest correlation of all measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The negative correlation between PDE3 activity and BMI in OM adipose tissue was also significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), as was the negative correlation between PDE4 and BMI in both depots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1a and 1b</xref>). There was a substantial amount of PDE activity remaining after inhibiting PDE3 and PDE4. The combined activities of these isoforms are hereafter referred to as PDEn.

Although the exact effects of reductions in PDE activities with increasing obesity are not known, the decreased PDE activities in adipose tissue seen in obesity might have potential physiological consequences. In obese subjects the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin is diminished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> PDE3B is the central enzyme controlling the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Thus, decreased PDE3B activity with increasing obesity, as seen in our study, may be a contributing factor to the diminished anti-lipolytic effect of insulin seen in obese patients. Decreased PDE4 activity in the adipose tissue of obese patients might also have consequences for lipolysis. Decreased PDE4 activities may potentially raise the rate of lipolysis, as seen in rat adipocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and lead to an increase in fatty acid release to the circulation. Excess fatty acids have been shown to interfere with insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle, contributing to the development of insulin resistance in these tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>This study also demonstrated that PDE activities other than PDE3 and PDE4 are present in adipose tissue and adipocytes. These activities were collectively referred to as PDEn and were also affected by obesity and T2D. PDEn activity was unique from PDE3 and PDE4 activity in certain aspects. PDEn activity was increased in SC adipose tissue from patients diagnosed with T2D. As PDEn does not include PDE3B, the only PDE isoform known to be regulated by insulin, it is not likely that the increased PDE activity reflects insulin supplementation or endogenous hyperinsulinemia. However, increased PDEn could reflect some other aspect of T2D. Further work using selective inhibitors of the PDE families that potentially contribute to PDEn will need to be carried out in a larger sample of T2D patients to determine which PDE families are responsible for this increased activity.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of obesity is an increase in the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells, with visceral adipose tissue being more prone to infiltration than SC adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> The consequences of decreased PDE activities in adipose tissue in obesity could also include altered states of inflammation. Previous studies have shown that the PDE3 inhibitor Cilostazol inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in cultured adipocytes as well as in the db/db mouse, a mouse model of T2D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Inhibitors to PDE3 and PDE4 enzymes show anti-inflammatory properties in certain immune cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In addition, mice deficient in the PDE4B protein were shown to have reduced adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, a marker of inflammation, when fed a high-fat diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup></p><p>In an attempt to understand more about the PDEn pool of PDEs, we performed western blot analysis of some PDEs for which selective inhibitors are not available. PDE9A and PDE10A were expressed in adipose tissue as well as in adipocytes. PDE7B was detected in adipose tissue but not in isolated adipocytes. Although PDE9 is selective for cGMP, PDE10 can hydrolyze both cGMP and cAMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that genetic deficiency of PDE10A in mice results in decreased body weight, particularly in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> PDE9A deficient mice fed a high-fat diet are reported to have reduced weight gain and fat mass compared with wild-type mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> These studies suggest a role for these PDEs in adipose tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, the presence of a cGMP-dependent lipolytic pathway, which is stimulated by atrial natiuretic peptide has been described in human adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> PDE9A and PDE10A might be candidates for the PDE, responsible for regulating the cGMP pool in adipocytes associated with atrial natiuretic peptide-induced lipolysis.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that PDE activities are reduced in obesity. Further studies will be performed in order to connect the altered activity profile of PDEs to different biological functions and thereby determine whether and how they have a role in the development of adipose tissue insulin resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Dr Jan Hedenbro, Dr Ann-Cathrin Moberg, Dr Dan Sevonius, Dr Jonas Hedstr&#x000f6;m and the nurses of the operation unit of Landskrona Hospital.
