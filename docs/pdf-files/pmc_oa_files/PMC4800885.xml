The literature studies were preliminary and scanty, but the results revealed that black seed plants have a potential therapeutic effect for oral and dental diseases. Such results are encouraging for the incorporation of these plants in dental therapeutics and hygiene products. However, further detailed preclinical and clinical studies at the cellular and molecular levels are required to investigate the mechanisms of action of NS and its constituents, particularly TQ.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Currently there is a worldwide growing interest on the use of medicinal herbs or plants in the treatment of various diseases due to their promising results and fewer side effects.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 60-80% of the world&#x02019;s population particularly in developing countries, depends on herbal remedies or traditional medicine for their primary health care and treatment.

Many pharmacologically active compounds have been isolated from black seeds, but the most reported active constituents are thymoquinone (TQ), dithymoquinone, thymol, and thymohydroquinone. Several nutritional components are found in the seeds, such as carbohydrates, fats, essential amino acids and vitamins.

In that study,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the animals were challenged with <italic>S. mutans</italic> and fed a diet rich of sucrose. The results showed that the rats&#x02019; treatment with 10 mg of TQ per body weight (in kg) in oral gel or drinking water statistically reduced the caries score (<italic>p</italic>=0.02) and plaque index (<italic>p</italic>=0.01) in comparison with the control groups. The authors attributed the decrease in dental caries to the microbial biofilm inhibition properties of TQ.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p><italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> remain the major pathogen in dental caries.

They used the method of broth microdilution to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NS essential oil and its TQ for oral cariogenic pathogens. Surprisingly, they found that 2.43 mg/disc essential oil contained only 3.35 &#x000b5;g/ml TQ, and showed more antimicrobial activity than the pure TQ compound (150 &#x000b5;g/disc). The latter was active against all of the studied strains, especially <italic>S. mutans</italic>, which showed inhibition zones of 24.5 &#x000b1; 0.71 mm, and <italic>Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis)</italic> with 22 &#x000b1; 1.41 mm. They explained the antibacterial effect of NS essential oil, even with a minimal amount of TQ, as being caused by its other more potent bactericidal components, such as p-cymene, limonene, and apinene.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The black seed oil extracts were not only found to have a bactericidal effect against <italic>S. mutans</italic> but also to have an effect on inhibiting the adherence of <italic>S. mutans</italic> to the surface of the teeth.</p><p>Abd-Awn et al<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> conducted a research using an agar diffusion test followed by a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination to test the NS oil extract&#x02019;s sensitivity to <italic>S. mutans</italic> and its ability to inhibit bacterial adherence to the dental plaque compared with chlorhexidine gluconate. The results showed that the black seed oil extract has 10% MBC against <italic>S. mutans</italic>.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, the authors recommended that further studies with different types of extracts (including those from different regions) be evaluated for the antibacterial activity of the black seed. In addition, they recommended an analysis of the extracts for their active ingredients, which are responsible for their antibacterial activity. They also cited the urgent need for finding a standard method for extract preparation.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The last point was found to be valid, as Mohammed<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> evaluated 2 different extracts of <italic>NS</italic> against 2 cariogenic bacteria, <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>S. mitis</italic>.

However, most of the population does not perform proper mechanical microbiome control due to lack of motivation or dexterity.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The regimen of periodontal treatment often includes the use of antibacterial agents, which can reach diseased sites systemically, or topically. A recent systematic review showed that mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine present high antiplaque (mean reduction of 40%), and antigingivitis efficacy (mean reduction of 28%), however, their adverse effects (such as, teeth and soft tissue staining) limit their use.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Many herbal products have been used as alternatives to these synthetic drugs.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Because of the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties of <italic>NS</italic> and TQ, the authors believe that these products could have a role in periodontal disease.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the rat model proposed by Al-Wafi et al,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> besides the anti-caries assessment, an evaluation of the potential preventive role of TQ on gingival inflammation was conducted. The results revealed that rats treated with TQ in drinking water or an oral gel had statistically significant lower periodontal indices and subgingival bacterial counts in comparison with both the negative and positive control groups. Additionally, their mandibular tissues, which were taken for histological examination to determine the degree of inflammation, demonstrated no signs of inflammation compared with the controls. Another in vivo study,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> also in a rat periodontitis model, investigated the preventive role of TQ in periodontal inflammation initiation and progression. In that study,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> the gingival margins of the rats&#x02019; molars were ligated with a 4/0 silk suture to induce periodontitis. The experiment included 24 rats that were randomly and equally distributed into 3 groups; nonligated (NL), ligature only (LO), and ligature plus daily treatment (TQ at 10 mg/kg). On day 11, the animals were sacrificed and in each group the alveolar bone levels of molars were clinically measured and examined histopathologically. The results revealed that there were statistically significant higher bone losses in the LO group in comparison with the NL and the TQ groups. The same was reported regarding the ratio of inflammatory cell infiltration to osteoclasts. However, the reverse was true regarding the osteoblasts, which showed significant lower activity in the LO group than in the NL and TQ groups. Thus, it was concluded that the oral administration of TQ helped in periodontal disease prevention as it diminished alveolar bone resorption.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Additionally, a clinical randomized single-blind split-mouth trial<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of a TQ-impregnated periodontal chip in chronic periodontitis. The study included the periodontal pockets of 12 male patients with chronic periodontitis. They were distributed into 3 groups: control (no treatment), plain chitosan chips, and TQ chips.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Interestingly, the results showed significant gains in the clinical attachments in the TQ groups compared with the other groups. Al-Bayaty et al<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> advised the use of TQ chips in chronic periodontitis patients as an adjunctive treatment during the scaling and root planing, or for maintenance visits.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-3"><title>Pulpal diseases</title><p>Intracanal antisepsis is considered to be one of the fundamental steps in root canal therapy.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that are both antibacterial and that exert minimal tissue irritation. Plant-derived products represent a rich source of antimicrobial compounds, and some have been incorporated into oral hygiene products. However, their application in endodontics is less well documented.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Only 2 studies<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> have been found to evaluate the possible use of NS or TQ in endodontics. One study<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> evaluated the antibacterial action of <italic>NS</italic> with 5 different concentrations of aluminum potassium sulfate (alum), <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> (Siwak), and a combination of all these on root canal bacteria isolated from 20 patients. The authors<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> found that all 3 tested herbs had bactericidal effects, and that the <italic>NS</italic> aqueous extract (100% concentration) showed maximum inhibition zones of 26 mm in diameter for <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, 22 mm in diameter for <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic>, 21 mm in diameter for <italic>Streptococcus anginosus</italic>, 20 mm in diameter for <italic>Staphylococcus epidermides</italic>, and 16 mm in diameter for <italic>Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus epidermides</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus durans</italic>. Another study<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> searched for a new capping medicament in pediatric dentistry to replace formocresol because of its reported side effects. The study compared the histopathological pulp response to NS oil and formocresol (FC) in dogs. The results showed that NS specimens histologically revealed mild to moderate vasodilatation with few inflammatory cells and a continuous odontoblastic layer. On the other hand, FC specimens showed advanced inflammation with severe vasodilatation and inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration. Thus, application of NS maintained the vitality of the pulp, which makes it a good pulpotomy agent in clinical practice.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-4"><title>Oral ulcerations, oral mucositis and wound healing</title><p>Oral ulcerations are common painful lesions that are related to various conditions ranging from minor local trauma to significant systemic conditions, such as hematological, gastroenterological, dermatological, and immunological diseases and malignancies.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Topical NS oil was found to have a good therapeutic effect on the healing of chemically induced oral ulcers. Al-Douri and Al-Kazaz<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> carried out an experiment on 12 rabbits. The authors created the ulcers with 0.3 ml of 1% formalin injections in the cheek mucosa of the rabbits followed by topical application of NS twice a day for 3 days. The animals were sacrificed on the fifth day, and their cheek mucosae were histologically examined. The results showed a significant healing process enhancement with NS treatment, and a marked anti-inflammatory activity and differences in the rate of epithelization between the NS and control groups. The authors justified the results by asserting that the <italic>NS</italic> oil accelerated the healing of ulcers, because it inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms at the site of the ulcers, which could retard the healing process. Moreover, the TQ flavonoids and the other components in the NS oil (vitamins and minerals) make it an excellent promoter of ulcer healing.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>Oral mucositis due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy represents a problematic side effect in cancer treatment.

An intraperitoneal injection of 5 fluorouracil (5FU) was used to induce mucositis in rats, and their cheek pouches on the right side were scratched with a wire brush to induce mucositis. Rats in the untreated group received oral physiologic saline, and those in the treated group were gavaged daily with 1 ml of NS seed extract (400 mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed on day 14, and the cheek pouch areas were excised and prepared for histological and immunohistochemical analysis using Bcl2 and PCNA immune labelling. The results showed that in comparison with controls and 5FU untreated rats, NS decreased the histologically observed damage of the cheek mucosa in the mucositis model.

The in vitro scratch assay was used to assess the effect on wound healing activity, while the extracts&#x02019; effect on collagen synthesis by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was determined by hydroxyproline levels.

The results showed an early detection of osteoid formation at the first week and bone trabeculae formation at the 6th week in sockets treated with NS (powder and oil). However, in the histological study, it was found that at the extraction sites, NS powder was more effective than the NS oil in terms of bone formation.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> They attributed this result to the complete absorption of the powder compared with the oil, which was applied with a piece of cotton for only 5 minutes and then removed.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Natural plants were proposed as a coating agent because the biological molecules improve osseointegration in dental implants.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, the literature concerning NS and bone healing is contradictory.

Group I was the control group, where the bony defects were left empty; Group II had bony defects that were filled with calcium hydroxide powder mixed with saline; Group III had bony defects that were filled with calcium hydroxide mixed with NS oil; and Group IV had bony defects that were filled with ready made bioactive glass particulates. After 3 weeks, one half of the animals were sacrificed, while the other half was sacrificed after 6 weeks. The results revealed that all of the used materials were biocompatible with the animal model, but the bioglass seemed to have the highest osteoconductive and osteostimulatory effects among the materials used. There was no bone formation in Groups I, II, and III after 3 and 6 weeks. Group IV after 3 weeks showed only minute amounts of osteoid tissues; however, after 6 weeks, more fibrous tissues were seen, and the borders of the defects were of normal thickness, and were smooth and lined by a well-defined osteoblastic layer.<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> On the other hand, an in vivo study<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> was conducted to investigate the black seed oil extract&#x02019;s effect on the bone implant interface&#x02019;s mechanical and histological properties. In the experiment, 12 New Zealand rabbits received 4 screw-shaped (84 CpTi) implants in the tibiae bone. The implants were divided into 2 groups; coated, and uncoated with black seed oil extract.

Meanwhile, the bacterial inhibitory zone of each of the nanosilver concentrations at 3500 ppm and the standard amoxicillin disc (25 &#x000b5;g) was 33.5-19.75 mm for <italic>S. mutans</italic> and 11-21.75 mm for <italic>S. sanguis</italic>.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Thus, nanosilver had the highest antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains, while NS and amoxicillin had a similar effect on <italic>S. mutans</italic> and NS was more effective than amoxicillin against <italic>S. sanguis</italic>.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-7"><title>B) Antifungal activity</title><p>Oral candidiasis is a common infection in the oral cavity caused by fungi, mostly <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Amphotericin B and triazoles, such as fluconazole and itraconazole are the most common antifungal agents that have been used systemically, or topically for fungal infections. Unfortunately, with a prolonged course of therapy, fungal resistance erupts as a challenge. Again, the medicinal plants have been attractive to scientists as possible alternative fungal treatments.<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>In Hail province, a study<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> assessed the in vitro inhibitory activity of ethanol extracts from 6 plants against oral candidal isolates. The latter were 65 <italic>Candida</italic> isolates collected from 175 patients attending private dental clinics. The experimental plants, which were purchased from local Saudi markets, included the following: <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (ginger); <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> (cinnamon); <italic>NS</italic> (black cumin); <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (clove); <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> (black pepper), and chamomile. It has been found that the highest inhibitory effects were reached with a 100 &#x000b5;g/ml concentration of cinnamon (34.6 mm) and clove (31.5 mm), while the same concentration of black cumin and chamomile recorded the smallest inhibition zone.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, the mean values of the inhibition zone of both the black cumin and chamomile were not significantly different from that of Amphotericin B.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Another study,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> claimed by the authors to be the first of its kind investigated the in vitro antifungal properties of Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and TQ against <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (yeasts and biofilm) in their nanoparticle forms in comparison with their conventional forms. The results showed that the nanosized drugs&#x02019; fo-rmulation increased the drug&#x02019;s efficacy 24 times against <italic>Candida albicans</italic> in both yeast and biofilm forms. Thus, this finding represents a major innovation in the medical field, as biofilm growth is more protected from host defenses and has enhanced resistance to antimicrobial agents.<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-8"><title>Oral cancer</title><p>Oral cancer is considered to be a multistep disease of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations in epithelial cells, which generally precedes histological changes. These changes accumulate throughout malignant transformation from benign to precancer lesions to the invasive cancer state.<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Oral cancer is ranked as the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide. Unfortunately, the 5-year survival for oral cancer has remained at 50% for a long time. This occurrence is due to several factors, such as late diagnosis, disease relapse, resistance to chemotherapy, and metastasis.<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Premalignant lesions could be subclinical conditions with normal mucosa or clinically obvious lesions, such as leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and submucous fibrosis. Studies showed that premalignant lesions are reversible conditions, as epithelial tissues retain normal mucosal morphology. This is true if carcinogenic insults related to an unhealthy lifestyle habits (such as, alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking) were adjusted. However, changing unhealthy habits might be hard for some, or undesirable for others. Instead, using pharmacological or natural products to prevent the progression of premalignant to cancerous lesions is a very attractive approach known as chemoprevention.<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>-<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Studies revealed that TQ restrains proliferation and promotes apoptosis in human cancer cell lines.<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>-<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p><p>In addition, TQ can be used as a chemosensitizing agent with drugs, or can be used with other chemotherapy drugs to achieve a synergistic effect. An example of this co-treatment is the combination of TQ and cisplatin, which was found to have a synergistic effect in preventing the proliferation and invasion of human lung cancer.<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Here, we focus on the effect of TQ in oral cancer treatment and prevention. Although only a few studies have been performed on the effect of TQ on oral cancer, it is still promising.<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> A study by Chu et al<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> revealed that the treatment of human oral cancer with TQ induces cell death by the 2 distinct mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagy. Apoptosis is programmed cell death. It is regulated by either the receptor-mediated death pathway, or by the mitochondrial pathway. Apoptosis causes changes to the cell that are characterized by cell shrinkage, bulge of the membrane, breakage of DNA, and caspase activation.<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Autophagy is an important physiological process that sustains cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. In cancer therapy studies, autophagy-inducing agents are used to stimulate nonapoptotic cell death.<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo, which strongly supported the TQ&#x02019;s antitumor activity. In vitro, treating SASVO3 oral cancer cells with TQ inhibited the growth of cells. These cells were arrested at the sub G1 phase (apoptotic cell population). Protein expression by western blots of Bcl2 (an inhibitor of apoptosis) and Bid were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion.</p><p>On the contrary, the protein expression of Bax (a promoter of apoptosis) and cleaved caspase 9 were also increased in a dose-dependent fashion. To verify the activation of apoptosis through caspase 9, the authors incubated SASVO3 cells with TQ and the caspase 9 inhibitor. Staining with annexinV/PI revealed a decrease in the TQ-induced apoptotic population after treatment with the inhibitors. Taken together, TQ induced apoptosis through the initiation of caspase 9. Autophagy-related proteins Beclim 1, class III PI3K complex, Rubicon, and Atg family proteins were expressed in SASVO3 cells treated with TQ. Additionally, as a protein indicator of autophagy, LC3II increased after TQ treatment and TQ induced autophagy. In vivo, nude mice were injected with luciferase expressing SASVO3 cells. Mice were treated with either TQ or olive oil (control). The TQ treatment reduced tumor weight by 3.4-fold by the 20th day. Protein expression of the TQ-treated tumor showed high levels of Bax and LC3II compared with the control animals. These results supported the in vitro results, where TQ treatment prompted apoptosis and autophagy in vivo. This study verified the need of multiple target therapy as an effective approach in anticancer treatment.<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Abdelfadil et al<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> carried out a study on the treatment of oral cancer cells with TQ. Their results showed that TQ induced apoptosis. The mouse cell line used in that study represents chemically induced oral squamous cell carcinoma (T28). Treating T28 with TQ induced apoptosis through the blocking of the p38&#x003b2; MAPK pathway and increased expression of proapoptotic proteins Bid and Bad with the activation of p53. Apoptosis in T28 cells occurred through caspase 3 cleavage. The difference in the apoptosis pathway between this study and the previous one is probably due to the use of different cell lines (human versus animal). Interestingly, TQ treatment induced downregulation of COX2, which in turn, decreases cell survival. Abdelfadil et al<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> stated that TQ has a promising potential in anticancer therapy by promoting apoptosis and reducing cell survival. The TQ not only can be used as a treatment for cancer but also as a chemopreventive. It prevents premalignant lesions to progress to cancer. Many studies have illustrated this concept regarding TQ in different cancer types.<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Only one oral cancer prevention study through the use of TQ has been published.<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> They used 7,12 dimethyl benz (a) anthracene (DMBA) in an induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis model to study TQ chemoprevention. The DMBA is known to induce multistep carcinogenesis. It starts with a sequence of hyperplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma, which is very similar to the development of oral cancer. For animals treated with TQ, the incidence of oral neoplasm and cytokeratin expression was significantly prevented.<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The NSE can be used in combination with chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin, to enhance the anticancer activity of the drug and as a protective agent for organs from its cytotoxic effect. We verified the protective effect of NSE in a DMBA-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis model treated with cisplatin.<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> The NSE protected the hamster kidney from nephrotoxic effects. Kidney function tests showed lower values in hamsters treated with TQ and cisplatin than hamsters treated with cisplatin alone. In addition, as found in this study, liver functions were better in the NSE-treated groups. In summary, NSE, and particularly TQ are promising products in the prevention and treatment of oral cancer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-9"><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p>The few last decades have shown a rise in using herbal medicine investigations to replace conventional treatments for various diseases and conditions.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Oral and dental diseases have not been an exception.
