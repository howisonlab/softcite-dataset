As a common chronic disease, endometriosis with its pathological findings influences patients' quality of life. Women with endometriosis are impaired by diverse factors physically, mentally, and socially. Without causal treatment options, endometriosis is a challenge in gynecological diagnosis and treatment.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Currently, laparoscopy is considered an effective and proven treatment option due to its good tolerance, low morbidity, and low total cost.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Combined surgical and medical treatment is often the most effective plan for improving the incidence of recurrence and the improvement of pregnancy rate in patients with endometriosis.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The high recurrence rate of ovarian endometrioma and its concurrent symptoms represents one of the less satisfactory aspects of the surgical treatment of endometriosis.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The definition and identification of risk factors for onset and recurrence of endometriosis cysts are essential to improve preoperative and postoperative therapy. Most studies examined operation type, size of the cyst, and medical treatment.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Prognostic value for predicting recurrent pain associated with endometriosis includes age, previous treatments, and the severity of the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose of the present study was to identify risk factors for endometriomas, recurrence of endometriomas, and pain with the aim to identify an optimal matching of surgical and medical treatment for an individual therapy concept. Because of the long-term follow-up of our patients, we attempted to obtain further evidence on the effectiveness of ovarian endometrioma surgery and its impact on pregnancy rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, patients with suspected endometriosis cyst or benign ovarian cyst, based on the medical and surgical reports at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Kiel in Germany from 1995 to 2004, were analyzed retrospectively. Of 3057 patients' medical records and surgical reports, we histologically verified 550 patients with ovarian endometriosis cysts undergoing either laparoscopic conservative excision or laparotomy. Their data regarding general patient characteristics, endometrioma symptoms, and diagnostic and surgical findings were collected from clinical records and reviewed <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. Patient characteristics are summarized in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold>. In August 2011, these 550 patients with endometriomas were approached via letter and asked to complete a questionnaire and return it to the clinic. In cases of invalid addresses, the current addresses of the patients were traced by the registration offices up to their second change of residence so that a maximum of 3 attempts were made to contact the patients. With a final return rate of 52.5%, there were 289 patients in the follow-up study. In the questionnaire, patients were asked about a postoperative occurrence of another endometriosis cyst, the temporal occurrence, and dignity. Furthermore, possible reoperation rate, operation type, and recurrent pain symptoms (pain lasting &#x0003e;1 week, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia) were inquired. Patients were questioned about their preoperative and postoperative fertility, whether a planned spontaneous pregnancy with or without complications occurred, and, in cases of infertility and pregnancy, desire if artificial insemination was successful. The recurrence of ovarian endometrioma was defined as a positive response to the presence of an endometriosis cyst (as reported by the patient) in the questionnaire. In the analysis of recurrence rate, patients with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis were excluded. The average follow-up period was 12.9 years with a minimal time of 7.0 years and a maximal time of 16.9 years between operation and follow-up.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Transvaginal ultrasonogram of a 6-cm (diameter), left ovarian endometrioma and its corresponding laparoscopic image.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jls0041332430001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Patient Characteristics (n = 550)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factors</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cases, n (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, y</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.2 &#x000b1;

A statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) between combined surgical and hormonal therapy and exclusive surgery was observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed risk factors, the effectiveness of endometrioma surgery comparing laparoscopy versus laparotomy, and the effect of additional medical treatment on recurrence and pregnancy rates.</p><p>The preoperative risk factors observed as having significant predictive value for presence of pain and dysmenorrhea were younger age, previous laparoscopic surgery of ovarian endometrioma, and nulliparity. Occurrence of pain seemed to be significantly associated with larger cyst size (&#x0003e;8 cm), while primary or secondary sterility was associated with a higher rate of dysmenorrhea. Concerning the recurrent symptoms, younger age, nulliparity, and larger cyst diameter significantly influenced the recurrence of dysmenorrhea, while only previous laparoscopic surgery of ovarian endometrioma was determined as significant risk factor for recurrence of pain. This was also reported by Bussacca et al<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and Porpora et al.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In agreement with Vercellini et al,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> a lower incidence of dysmenorrhea in older age is justifiable due to the postmenopausal changes. The medical condition of a patient can be adversely affected by a previous operation, such as laparoscopy or a longer-existing disease with possible adhesion formation as a natural consequence of the surgical trauma.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Other studies also suggest that adhesions are important for the cause of endometriosis-associated pain, whereas the cyst diameter in contradiction to our study has no significant correlation between cyst size and pain symptoms.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In line with earlier studies that indicate pregnancy as a protective factor for endometriosis-associated pain,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> nulliparity is attributed a predictive value for pain symptoms in the present study. However, only a few prospective studies have tried to determine factors with predictive value for recurrent pain.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Many studies have analyzed the recurrence rate of endometriomas after laparoscopic surgery, and found that the recurrence rate is between 11.0% and 30.4% after &#x02265;2 years of observation.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The results of Busacca et al<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> showed a recurrence of ovarian endometriomas in 24.6% at 4 years after surgery. These results strongly resemble ours, which showed a recurrence rate of 23.9%. The discrepancy of numbers in the literature could be due to different observation periods and criteria for the definition of recurrence. As recurrent endometriosis is among the significant challenges in this disease, reoperation is currently often regarded as the best treatment option, though the extent and duration of the effect of second-line operation remains unclear.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the present follow-up, a reoperation rate of 68.1% was observed in 32 of 47 patients with recurrent endometrioma who had ovarian endometriomas initially diagnosed at surgery. These observations agree with those of Cheong et al,<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> but not with the lower requirement of reoperation in other observations.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>A history of preoperative pain or preoperative dysmenorrhea was shown to be a significant factor associated with higher recurrence rates, which agrees with a study by Renner et al.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In our study, we observed significantly lower recurrence-free intervals for such preoperative complaints. In the present study, larger cyst size, as also reported by Kikuchi et al<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Koga et al,<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> younger age at surgery, and preoperative cyst rupture seemed to increase the risk of ovarian endometrioma recurrence. An attempt to explain our results regarding preoperative cyst rupture can be derived from the assumptions of Kikuchi et al<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> that recurrent cysts occur in the lesions, in which a cystectomy was performed, whereby endometrial cells contacted the peritoneal surface.</p><p>Regarding the effectiveness of endometrioma surgery, laparoscopy showed the best results in terms of a symptom-free postoperative course and pain reduction. Although other investigators mentioned equivalent therapeutic success under laparoscopy and laparotomy, the laparoscopic approach is preferred.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This could be because of its good tolerance, low morbidity, and low total cost of treatment<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or because laparoscopy with sampling for histological investigation is the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis in the evaluation of persistent complaints and therefore often used.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The impact of postoperative hormone therapy on ovarian endometriosis remains currently unclear. To determine the effect of additional postoperative medical treatment, in the present follow-up, patients with hormone therapy (56.1%) were compared with those without (43.9%). Our study was in line with previous observations<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> that patients do not significantly benefit from additional postoperative hormone therapy (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, oral contraceptive, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or danazol) in terms of reducing the risk of disease and pain recurrence. We observed even lower probabilities for a recurrence-free interval referring to an average of 12.9 years of follow-up in patients receiving hormone therapy versus patients with exclusive surgical therapy. A retrospective study<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> indicated previous medical treatment of endometriosis as a significant risk factor (<italic>P</italic> = .009) for higher recurrence. Yap et al<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> indicated that there was a significant improvement in the recurrence rate after postoperative hormone intake, but compared with exclusive surgery, there were no beneficial effects on pain and pregnancy rate recorded.</p><p>Among the 111 patients with a desire to become pregnant, the postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rate was 54.1%, correlating with fertility rates in observations by Vercellini et al<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and Jones and Sutton.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> As the present study analyzes only the surgical outcome of total endometrioma excision, we were unable to make comparisons with other surgical techniques such as fenestration or ablation. Favorable outcomes under laparoscopic cystectomy were reported by Alborzi et al<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and Hart et al.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Littman et al<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> declared a positive impact of laparoscopy for the treatment of endometriosis even after multiple in vitro fertilization failures. In contrast, other investigators<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> suggested that laparoscopic endometrioma excision has an adverse effect by reducing the ovarian reserve. The present study indicates that there is a positive impact of additional medical treatment on postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rate in line with previous observations.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In contrast, other studies<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> observed a missing hormonal impact on the fertility rate after surgery.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Further studies are necessary to determine the most effective treatment of ovarian endometrioma.</p><p>A limitation of this study is its study model, a retrospective cohort study, which has lower evidence and validity compared, for example, with a randomized controlled study. The definition of recurrence varies in the literature. Some studies define recurrence as a typical morphological change represented in a vaginal ultrasonogram, whereas others define it as a recurrence or worsening view of subjectively perceived pain. Although the general definition of a recurrent endometriosis remains to be determined, our definition represents a limitation because it is based on a questionnaire. We considered a positive response to the presence of a cyst or tumor in the questionnaire as a recurrence of endometriosis. Biases in this study include the alternating surgeon's experience, the low return rate of questionnaires, and the development in hormonal treatment within the period of data collection and observation (eg danazol is now nearly obsolete due to irreversible side effects). Among the strengths of the study are the long follow-up period, large sample size, and the fact that all patients were operated on in the same hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study identifies risk factors for recurrent ovarian endometrioma in our patient population as preoperative pain, preoperative dysmenorrhea, and larger cyst size. Neither pain symptoms nor the risk of recurrence is included in the current endometriosis classifications. The establishment of a modified classification based on risk factors with high prognostic clinical outcome should be sought, allowing an optimal individual therapy concept.</p><p>The present study also indicates that patients with ovarian endometriomas and a desire for pregnancy seem to profit from additional postoperative medical treatment. For patients with completed family planning, the indication of additional postoperative medical treatment needs to be well evaluated according to patients' preferences.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
