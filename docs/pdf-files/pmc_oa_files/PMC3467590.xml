Thus, control of such diabetes care measures are well-accepted indicators&#x02014;as intermediate process outcomes of high quality of care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> However, diabetes care measures of their appropriate control lag behind; only 7% of diabetes patients in USA meet the American Diabetes Association recommendations for glycated haemoglobin (A1c), BP and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Furthermore, diabetes is more endemic in the Southern USA and individuals with diabetes in this area have worse control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7 R8">5&#x02013;8</xref> Hence, public health interventions, which consider distance barriers in rural setting and aimed at improving diabetes control in patients living in rural areas, are warranted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11">9&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>The Rural Diabetes Online Care (R-DOC) study was a rigorously tested cluster-randomised clinical trial comparing a multicomponent physician intervention including web-based continuous medical education (CME), performance feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12 R13 R14">12&#x02013;14</xref> and quality improvement tools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> to a concurrent control website in rural Southeast USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The primary outcomes were measures of acceptable and optimal control for A1c, BP and LDL; the secondary outcomes were process measures (rate of assessment and group means of A1c, BP and LDL). Despite the non-significant effect attributable to the intervention for any of the primary outcomes in the R-DOC study, we observed an absolute increase in the rates of assessment of A1c and LDL in both study arms (A1c, intervention 30%, control 29%, p&#x0003c;0.001; LDL, intervention 35%, control 38%, p=0.05).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However, whether physicians in rural areas adjust medications to control A1c, BP or LDL has not been examined in wide-reach, low-intensity interventions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11">9&#x02013;11</xref> such as the one utilised in the R-DOC study.</p><p>Thus, we now report the medication intensification outcomes of the R-DOC study&#x02014;specifically, medication intensification to improve overall control of haemoglobin A1c, BP and LDL in the rural Southeastern USA. Our findings from the main R-DOC study and this report have important implications for distant CME programmes, quality improvement initiatives and implementation research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The R-DOC study was a cluster-randomised trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00403091).

Physicians were enrolled in the study sequentially from September 2006 to September 2008, provided informed consent online, and were randomised to the intervention or control arms using block randomisation which was concealed to the investigators and statisticians. The unit of randomisation was the physician (and not a practice); however, for physicians working in a group practice, only one physician per practice could enrol in the study. The protocol was approved by the local institutional review boards at The University of Alabama at Birmingham and Tuscaloosa medical campuses.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention arm description</title><p>The website focused on helping physicians to achieve A1c, BP and LDL control in their diabetic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>

The feedback reports compared each intervention arm participant's personal performance compared to the performance for the top 10% of other intervention arm participants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The feedback reports consisted of diabetes control (A1c &#x0003c;7%, systolic BP &#x0003c;130&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, LDL &#x0003c;100&#x02005;mg/dl), counselling on diet or exercise and medication intensification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Control arm description</title><p>The control website contained: (1) links to diabetes practice guidelines and patient education materials; (2) a list of educational conferences on general medical topics (updated monthly); (3) an area to track and view their CME credit and (4) a link to an external medical blog. Physicians in the control group did not receive performance feedback reports or electronic communications.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data sources</title><p>All participating physicians provided copies of records of 15 (intervention arm physicians) or 10 (control arm physicians) of their own consecutively seen patients with diabetes at baseline and again at follow-up (representing two cross-sectional views of each physician's panel of patients). Since the focus of the intervention was the physician, we were less interested in specific patients but rather each physician's panel on average. Therefore, two samples as serial cross-sections would better represent any change in the physician's own panel on average. This method is similar to practice feedback for quality improvement purposes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> The number of records was selected to balance rigour and cost (see also sample size description in the statistical section below).</p><p>Patient inclusion criteria were having at least two office visits during the past year and no dialysis, dementia, organ transplantation, HIV/AIDS, terminal illness or malignancy (except for skin and prostate cancer). Data abstraction was performed by trained personnel on blinded records sent to the study centre (or abstracted on site). Details of data abstracted, quality controls and physician compensation are published elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>In our main study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> the main outcomes were measures of acceptable and optimal diabetes control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> The main outcome for this report is medication intensification, defined as a dose increase of an existing medication or the addition of a new class of medication for glucose, blood pressure and lipids control on any of the three most recent office visits. Medication intensification equalled the proportion of patients who had a glucose-lowering medication, antihypertensive medication or cholesterol-lowering medication added or increased over the three most recent visits divided by the total number of patients assessed at baseline or follow-up. As a secondary outcome, we also explored medication intensification by level of glucose, BP or lipid control.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical approach</title><p>We calculated the sample size for the main study results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> On the basis of clinically important differences, the study required 100 physicians per trial arm to detect a minimum of 0.4% difference in A1c, 6&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in BP and 6&#x02005;mg/dl in LDL for the main outcomes (power 80%, &#x003b1;=0.05, up to 20% dropout) (10 patients per physician at baseline and at follow-up).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However, intervention arm physicians were asked to provide 15 patient records at baseline (and not at follow-up) because of the need to construct audit and feedback reports as part of the intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> for A1c, BP and lipids, reflecting the fact that not all diabetes patients also have hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The initial study was not powered to perform adjusted analysis for the intensification outcomes of this report.</p><p>All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. The relationship between the main and secondary outcomes and the effect of the intervention were examined with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), accounting for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calculated, adjusting for covariates that differed between baseline and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates included in these adjusted analyses included race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in SAS and was adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in the control group over time, thus capturing temporal trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient represented the difference-of-differences for over-time change in the intervention versus control group, and was a direct comparison of over-time change for the intervention versus the control group. A positive OR meant that the odds of a patient being in control increased more over time for the intervention versus control group. All analyses were performed in SAS V.9.2 (Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Recruitment scheme, patient characteristics and web utilisation</title><p>The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram and patients characteristics at baseline and at follow-up (modified from a prior publication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) are included in this report for completeness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012000959F1">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012000959TB1">table 1</xref>).

However, the absolute rate of intensification of medications to control A1c increased in both study arms at the end of the study by a modest amount (&#x0223c;6%).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>Medication intensification is emerging as a process measure for quality improvement efforts among patients with diabetes mellitus; pharmacotherapy intensification is strongly linked to improved A1c, BP and LDL. For example, in a study of over one million members with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Selby <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> found that a 5% improvement in treatment intensification led to a 1.0&#x02013;1.9% improvement in control for the entire population.

Glucose control, mean A1c value, worsened in the control group by 0.06, improved in the simulated case-based group by 0.01, and worsened in the case-based and leader feedback by 0.18. Among the 907 patients with A1c&#x0003e;7%, medication intensification was similar between groups (31.5%, control; 32.6%, case-based; 36.8%, case-based and leader feedback; p=0.41). Similarly, among the 701 patients with LDL-C &#x0003e;99&#x02005;mg/dl, medication intensification was similar between groups (20.8%, control; 24.2%, case-based; 21.8%, case-based and leader feedback; p=0.66). Finally, among the 949 patients with BP values &#x0003e;130/mm&#x02005;Hg, medication intensification was similar between groups (27.3%, control; 24.7%, case-based; 28.2%, case-based and leader feedback; p=0.61). Medication intensification was defined by the initiation or titration in 12&#x02005;months after the intervention for all patients with goals above target (A1c&#x0003e;=7%, LDL-C &#x0003e;=100&#x02005;mg/dl, BP&#x0003e;130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg); insulin titration was excluded from the outcome. The attrition rate was 33% (38/59 physicians). Our case scenarios took less than 10&#x02005;min to complete as compared with the ones in this study (over 60&#x02005;min each).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Perhaps striking a balance between more &#x02018;intense&#x02019; cases to increase physician engagement and providing feedback information may lead to the improvement in medication intensification. Finally, the medication intensification rates definitions were different from ones used in our study; hence, they cannot be compared.</p><p>In a randomised trial of 3703 patients with diabetes and their 123 physicians, participants were randomised to receive customised feedback of clinical information in four groups: patient only, physician only, both the patient and physician, or neither one.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> At 12&#x02005;months, interventions had no effect on A1c test ordering, medication intensification or improvement in A1c or LDL control.

During the 3&#x02005;months of the study, the A1c levels decreased among patients in the intervention as compared with the control group (by 2.0% vs 0.7%; respectively); medications were changed or intensified in 84% in the intervention group as compared with 23% patients in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.002). The operational definition for medication intensification in this study was not reported. Cell phone technology provides the opportunity for wide reach approach.

Second, the high attrition, 95 of the 205 randomised physicians provided baseline and follow-up data, may have introduced biases. By design, to test a purely online intervention, we chose not to enhance retention activities as typically seen in randomised clinical trials and focused on several aspects of provider-based implementation tools.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Although a comprehensive analysis would have been enlightening, we did not perform a systematic examination of this negative trial, or how such intervention might work it were effective.

In this study, using a wide-reach approach, we examined the effectiveness of a potential public health intervention. Effective interventions may be limited by their low-reach, specificity to fewer settings, expense and limited sustainability&#x02014;thus limiting their generalisability. Testing less intensive interventions with wider reach in rural settings has been advocated in public health interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Finding effective strategies to accomplish continuing professional development for physicians practising in remote locations is also an important objective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> In contrast, higher-intensity interventions in rural and community settings have shown promising results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32 R33 R34 R35 R36">32&#x02013;36</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a wide-reach, low-intensity, web-based interactive multicomponent intervention had no significant incremental effect on medication intensification for control of glucose, BP or lipids for patients with diabetes of physicians practising in the rural Southeastern USA.
