However, apart from grant-funded multidisciplinary clinics, there are no reports on the usage of same-day physical therapy (PT) consults within a daily outpatient neuromuscular disease (NMD) physician clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To determine the impact of same-day PT consults at the University of Utah&#x02019;s outpatient Clinical Neurosciences Center.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A qualitative assessment and survey of patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An eight question Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant patient satisfaction survey using a 5-point Likert scale was administered.

These clinics are often limited to regional specialized care centers and occur with more limited frequency. Our program aimed to create a sustainable model for the inclusion of same-day physical therapy (PT) consults in team-based health care. We hypothesize that many patients with NMD in the Intermountain West Region may be restricted by their geography<xref rid="b16-jmdh-9-493" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and not able to access specialized therapy consults and that access to this service and patient satisfaction can be improved by implementing same-day PT consults to their physician visit when necessary.</p><p>The aims of this pilot program were to: 1) determine if self-reported patient satisfaction outcomes support the use of same-day PT consults; 2) determine if there is any relationship between geographic location and a patient&#x02019;s history of access to PT care; 3) determine if there is any difference in patient satisfaction for the neuromuscular division of medical providers when compared to data from the previous year; and 4) collect and analyze data on the financial viability of this model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This pilot program was conducted over the course of 12 months (January 2015&#x02013;January 2016) at the University of Utah&#x02019;s Clinical Neuroscience Center outpatient clinic.

Patients were identified as having a need for PT services by a physician and were subsequently evaluated by a licensed physical therapist with experience in NMD. Each consult consisted of a single encounter, including, but not limited to, patient history, physical examination, special tests, assessment, rehabilitation diagnosis, design of a treatment plan, and any appropriate orders or referrals for durable medical equipment and/or follow-up therapy services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patient satisfaction survey</title><p>A self-administered eight question HIPAA-compliant patient satisfaction survey using a 5-point Likert scale (1 &#x02013; strongly disagree to 5 &#x02013; strongly agree) (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jmdh-9-493">Table 1</xref>) was given to each patient by the physical therapist in the treatment room directly after the conclusion of the same-day PT encounter using a touch-screen tablet computer. All patients completed the survey in the treatment room in the absence of the therapist, providers, or staff to control for bias.

Overall satisfaction was 89.9%, with a total response rate of 17.5%. Also, 91.3% reported they would recommend the provider and 92.8% would recommend the practice. Comparatively, a total of 320 Press-Ganey Provider Satisfaction surveys were collected for the year that coincided with the same-day PT consult program, January 2015&#x02013;January 2016, with a total response rate of 18.3%. Overall satisfaction for this group was 90.8%, and the difference between the two groups was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.427). In all, 93.5% reported they would recommend the provider and 94.0% would recommend the practice to a friend or family member. Overall, 100% of patient encounters reported that they would recommend same-day PT consults to a friend or family member, a +6% difference between groups. The largest improvement in patient satisfaction between the previous and current year was observed in the likelihood of recommending the practice, +1.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial sustainability</title><p>Downstream revenue was calculated for 134 patient electronic medical records, receiving same-day PT encounters. A total of 109 unique encounters were identified that met criteria for financial analysis of downstream revenue. For these 109 same-day PT encounters, the average cost of a visit was 48% of the average downstream charges, with an average charge of $900, and the average reimbursement rate was 37% per encounter, yielding a net negative margin. Fully adjusted margin for salary and facility charges was not captured in this analysis as they had already been taken into account for the physician visit.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, this study shows that patient satisfaction is very high for those patients having access to same-day PT consults after their physician visit and supports continued use of this model. This program also demonstrated that a modest portion, greater than one-third, of NMD patients are separated by considerable distance from access to specialized NMD care. Our results also indicate that a substantial majority of patients surveyed (&#x0003e;75%) reported having never before received PT care for their NMD, of whom a considerable number were male. This pilot suggests that large hospitals and academic medical centers with specialized care and resources could employ this model for patients with NMD to improve access for those who may be disconnected from expert care due to their geographical location. Those patients who received same-day PT consults after their neuromuscular physician visit were more satisfied and more likely to recommend the service. However, our financial data suggest that this model is not yet financially sustainable and the host clinic incurs a net cost. Further study is necessary to evaluate this model&#x02019;s transferability and financial sustainability at other institutions.</p><p>This study does have limitations. Potential limitations may include a modest sample size. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at a single point in time during a patient&#x02019;s care and our population may have varied from new diagnosis to advanced stages of disease. The population represented in our data may not necessarily be representative of all NMD diagnoses as disease severity can vary greatly and NMDs are inherently heterogeneous in nature. Also, our population may not represent other traditional outpatient neuromuscular clinics in other regions, as muscular dystrophies may be overrepresented in our data due to the prevalence of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy seen in Utah.<xref rid="b17-jmdh-9-493" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Potential bias may exist as the therapist administered the survey tool at the conclusion of the visit and only 45.5% of our total number of same-day PT consult encounters completed the online satisfaction survey tool. In comparison, however, an average of only 17.9% of patients seen by the Neuromuscular Division of Medicine had completed Press-Ganey Provider Satisfaction surveys. Fluctuations in patient volume were observed during holidays and at times when providers were attending professional conferences and meetings, which could have affected the amount of data collected.</p><p>Likewise, many patients seen for their physician visit were either currently receiving PT, had recently received and completed PT, or did not have an immediately identified need for PT. Therefore, these patients did not meet our inclusion criteria and were not referred for a same-day PT consult nor were they included in our analysis. Our data could be overrepresentative of patients with decreased access to care, as these more complex patients may have a greater need of services due to scarcity of local resources. Thus, our data may also be biased given the geographic nature of the rural Intermountain West Region and may not be applicable to other regions across the US.<xref rid="b16-jmdh-9-493" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> One study demonstrated an analysis of travel times and distances to health care in which the Intermountain West Region holds a larger portion of highly rural areas when compared to other regions of the US.<xref rid="b16-jmdh-9-493" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Overall, same-day PT consults in an outpatient physician clinic is a novel and easily reproducible model, is feasible, and our preliminary data suggest excellent patient satisfaction and increased access to patients who have never before seen a PT for their NMD. In the future, this model could potentially be utilized for tele-rehabilitation consults in an effort to provide PT consults and advice to patients in rural and remote partner clinic sites. This may help provide rural patients more frequent access to readily available teleconference rehabilitation consultations while decreasing their travel burden and decreasing costs to the university. This model could be easily implemented in other outpatient physician clinics, which may help provide better community outreach and access to services for those patients coming from a great distance or when their disability limits their means to travel. Large academic medical centers with access to the latest technology, resources, and experienced personnel could feasibly incorporate same-day PT consults services to optimize patient care for those who are separated by large geographic distances from the care they require.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all of the staff and faculty at the
