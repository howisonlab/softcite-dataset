We have shown that dual adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors effectively transfer <italic>ABCA4</italic> to the retina of <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice. However, they express both lower levels of transgene compared with a single AAV and truncated proteins. To increase productive dual AAV concatemerization, which would overcome these limitations, we have explored the use of either various regions of homology or heterologous inverted terminal repeats (ITR). In addition, we tested the ability of various degradation signals to decrease the expression of truncated proteins. We found the highest levels of transgene expression using regions of homology based on either alkaline phosphatase or the F1 phage (AK). The use of heterologous ITR does not decrease the levels of truncated proteins relative to full-length ABCA4 and impairs AAV vector production. Conversely, the inclusion of the CL1 degradation signal results in the selective degradation of truncated proteins from the 5&#x02032;-half without affecting full-length protein production. Therefore, we developed dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors including homologous ITR2, the photoreceptor-specific G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 promoter, the AK region of homology and the CL1 degradation signal. We show that upon subretinal administration these vectors are both safe in pigs and effective in <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice. Our data support the use of improved dual AAV vectors for gene therapy of STGD1.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>European Research Council/ERC</funding-source><award-id>282085</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>Italian Telethon Foundation</funding-source><award-id>TGM11MT1</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stargardt disease (STGD1; MIM#248200), the most common form of inherited macular degeneration in humans, is caused by mutations in <italic>ABCA4</italic> [coding sequence (CDS): 6822 bp], which encodes the photoreceptor (PR)-specific all-trans-retinal transporter (<xref rid="DDV386C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the absence of a functional ABCA4 protein, vitamin A aldehyde forms bisretinoid adducts that are deposited in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells during the process of disc shedding and phagocytosis. Consequently, abnormally high levels of lipofuscin pigments, such as A2E and all-trans-retinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine, accumulate in the RPE, triggering RPE-cell death and causing secondary PR degeneration (<xref rid="DDV386C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice (<xref rid="DDV386C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), the only STGD1 animal model, recapitulate some of the features of the human retinal disease including abnormal lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE.</p><p>Sight-restoring therapy for many inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) including STGD1, is still a major unmet medical need. Gene therapy with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represents, to date, the most promising approach for treatment of many IRDs (<xref rid="DDV386C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, one of the main obstacles for the use of AAV is their packaging capacity limited to &#x0223c;5 kb. This has become a limiting factor for the development of gene replacement therapy for common IRDs due to mutations in genes with a CDS larger than 5 kb, which include, among others, STGD1. Dual AAV vectors, based on the ability of AAV genomes to concatamerize via intermolecular recombination, have been successfully exploited to overcome this limitation (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Others and we have recently shown the potential of dual AAV vectors in the retina (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In particular we have reported that dual AAV hybrid AK vectors which rely on both ITR-mediated concatemerization and homologous recombination mediated by the AK sequence of the F1 phage for the reconstitution of the full-length expression cassette, transduce efficiently mouse and pig PR and rescue the <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mouse retinal phenotype (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, critical issues need to be addressed before considering further clinical translation of this strategy. First, the levels of PR transduction achieved with dual AAV vectors are lower than those achieved with single normal size AAV vectors (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A second major issue associated with the use of dual AAV vectors is the production of truncated proteins from the 5&#x02032;-half vector that contains the promoter sequence and/or from the 3&#x02032;-half vector due to the low promoter activity of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Both increased transduction efficiency and reduction of truncated protein production may be achieved by boosting the directional formation of productive tail-to-head concatemers, which reduces the number of non-concatemerized single AAV vector halves from which the truncated protein products derive. Since directional reconstitution of dual AAV hybrid vectors relies on recombination mediated by regions of homology included in the two vectors, we sought to evaluate side-by-side the various recombinogenic regions used in the context of dual AAV hybrid vectors which include those derived from either the human placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA (<xref rid="DDV386C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or the AK sequence from the F1 phage (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Another option we have explored to increase the generation of productive tail-to-head AAV genome concatemers is the use of vectors with heterologous ITR (i.e. vectors with ITR from different AAV serotypes at the opposite ends of the viral genome). Indeed, vectors with heterologous ITR from serotypes 2 and 5 (ITR2 and ITR5, respectively), which are highly divergent [58% of homology (<xref rid="DDV386C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)], show both reduced ability to form circular monomers and increased directional tail-to-head concatamerization than vectors with homologous ITR (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and reconstitute transgene expression more efficiently than dual AAV vectors with homologous ITR (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Although highly recombinogenic sequences and/or heterologous ITR can be explored to achieve higher rates of productive dual AAV concatemer formation, the production of truncated protein products might still remain an issue. MicroRNA (miR) target sequences, artificial stop codons or protein ubiquitination signals can be exploited to mediate the degradation of truncated protein products. Among the miR expressed in the retina, miR-let7b or -26a are expressed at high levels (<xref rid="DDV386C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) while miR-124 and -204 have been shown to restrict AAV-mediated transgene expression to either RPE or PR, respectively (<xref rid="DDV386C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Signals that mediate the degradation of proteins include: (i) the short degron CL1, a C-terminal destabilizing peptide that shares structural similarities with misfolded proteins and is thus recognized by the ubiquitination system (<xref rid="DDV386C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), (ii) ubiquitin, whose fusion at the N-terminal of a donor protein mediates both direct protein degradation or degradation via the N-end rule pathway (<xref rid="DDV386C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and (iii) the N-terminal PB29 degron which is a 9 aminoacid-long peptide which, similarly to the CL1 degron, is predicted to fold in structures that are recognized by enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway (<xref rid="DDV386C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Additionally, artificial stop codons can be inserted to cause the early termination of an mRNA. We evaluated the ability of these strategies to silence the expression of truncated proteins from dual AAV vectors. Finally, in view of a possible clinical translation of dual AAV vectors for retinal gene therapy, we evaluated the efficacy and the safety of dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors including these optimized features in <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice and in wild-type mice and pigs, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors which include the AK or AP1 recombinogenic regions show efficient mouse photoreceptor transduction</title><p>We evaluated in parallel the transduction efficacy of dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors with different regions of homology. The most used derive from either the head or tail (<xref rid="DDV386C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) of the middle one-third of the human placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA (<xref rid="DDV386C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We have previously shown that dual AAV hybrid vectors including the AK sequence from the F1 phage outperform those including the sense placental alkaline phosphatase head region sequence [AP (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>], which we generated based on the description provided in Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDV386C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Recently, the exact sequence of the head and tail placental alkaline phosphatase sequences (AP1 and AP2) have been published by Lostal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDV386C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These correspond to the reverse complementary (antisense) sequences in the middle one-third of the AP cDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Thus, we compared the efficacy of these AP1 and AP2 sequences to that of both the AK sequence and of the AP sequence we have previously tested in Trapani <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For this purpose we generated dual AAV2/2 hybrid vectors that include the <italic>ABCA4</italic>-3&#x000d7;flag CDS, under the control of the ubiquitous CMV promoter, and either the AK (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), AP (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), AP1 or AP2 (<xref rid="DDV386C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) regions of homology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). We used these vectors to infect HEK293 cells [multiplicity of infection, m.o.i.: 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> genome copies (GC)/cell of each vector]. Cell lysates were analysed by Western blot with anti-3&#x000d7;flag antibodies to detect ABCA4-3&#x000d7;flag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F2">2</xref>A). Each of the dual AAV hybrid vectors sets resulted in expression of full-length proteins of the expected size that were not detected in the lanes loaded with negative controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F2">2</xref>A). Quantification of ABCA4 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F2">2</xref>B) showed that infection with dual AAV hybrid AP1 and AP2 vectors resulted in slightly higher levels of transgene expression than with dual AAV hybrid AK vectors and all significantly outperformed dual AAV hybrid AP vectors. We have previously found that the efficiency of dual AAV vectors which rely on homologous recombination is lower in terminally-differentiated cells as PR than in cell culture (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We therefore evaluated PR-specific transduction levels in C57BL/6 mice following subretinal administration of dual AAV2/8 AK, AP1 and AP2 vectors which include the PR-specific human G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) promoter (dose of each vector/eye: 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> GC; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F2">2</xref>C). One month after vector administration we detected efficient ABCA4 protein expression more frequently in retinas treated with dual AAV hybrid AK than AP1 or AP2 vectors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F2">2</xref>C). However, the average ABCA4 expression levels from all treated eyes were not significantly different between eyes injected with dual AAV hybrid AK, AP1 and AP2 vectors [mean <italic>ABCA4</italic> levels: AK: 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 arbitrary units (a.u.); AP1: 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 a.u.; AP2: 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.5 a.u. No significant differences were found using one-way ANOVA. More details on the quantification and specific statistical values can be found in the Material and Methods section].

The production of dual AAV vectors bearing heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 requires the simultaneous expression of the Rep proteins from AAV serotypes 2 and 5 which cannot cross-complement virus replication (<xref rid="DDV386C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that Rep2 and Rep5 can bind interchangeably to ITR2 or ITR5, although less efficiently than to homologous ITR, however they cannot cleave the terminal resolution sites of the ITR from the other serotype (<xref rid="DDV386C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, before generating dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5, we assessed the potential competition of (i) Rep5 with Rep2 in the production of AAV2/2-CMV-<italic>EGFP</italic> vectors (i.e. vectors with homologous ITR2) and (ii) Rep2 with Rep5 in the production of AAV5/2-CMV-<italic>EGFP</italic> vectors (i.e. vectors with homologous ITR5), using the same amount of the Rep5Cap2 and Rep2Cap2 packaging constructs (ratio1:1). Indeed, when the Rep5Cap2 packaging construct is provided in addition to Rep2Cap2, the total yields of AAV2/2-CMV-<italic>EGFP</italic> vectors are reduced to 42% of those of control preparations obtained when only Rep2Cap2 is provided as packaging construct (average of four independent preps of each type, <italic>p</italic> Student's <italic>t</italic>-test: 0.014). Conversely, no significant differences were found in the total yields of AAV5/2-CMV-<italic>EGFP</italic> preps obtained when Rep2Cap2 was added to Rep5Cap2, which were 83% of those obtained when Rep5Cap2 was the only packaging construct transfected (average of four independent preps of each type, no significant differences were found using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). Given the competition of Rep5 with Rep2 in the production of vectors with ITR2, we tested three different ratios between Rep5 and the Rep2Cap2 packaging constructs in the production of dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 (Protocol A with 1:1, Protocol B with 1:3 and Protocol C with 1:10 Rep5:Rep2Cap2 ratio). As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>, viral titres determined by PCR quantification using a probe annealing to ITR2 progressively increased when the amount of Rep5 was decreased, with the best titre obtained with Protocol C. These results confirmed the competition of Rep5 with Rep2 during the production of vectors with ITR2 and led us to follow Protocol C for the production of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5. However, several AAV preparations obtained with this strategy revealed: (i) up to 6-fold lower titres determined on ITR2 than titres determined on a transgenic sequence in between the ITR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV386TB1">1</xref>) which could suggest that the integrity of ITR2 is compromised and (ii) a mean reduction of about 6-fold in the total yields of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 compared with those containing homologous ITR2 (<italic>p</italic> Student's <italic>t</italic>-test: 0.04; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV386TB1">1</xref>). However, Southern blot analysis of AAV preparations with heterologous ITR revealed no evident alterations of genome integrity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F3">3</xref>A). To test if the inclusion of heterologous ITR in dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors enhanced the formation of tail-to-head productive concatemers and full-length protein transduction while reducing the production of truncated proteins, we infected HEK293 cells with dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors with either heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 (in the 5:2/2:5 configuration) or homologous ITR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F3">3</xref>B). Given the difference between the ITR2 and transgene titres for vectors with heterologous but not homologous ITR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV386TB1">1</xref>), we infected cells with 10<sup>4</sup> GC/cell of each vector based on either ITR2 or transgene titres. Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells infected with dual AAV vectors based on ITR2 titres showed that the inclusion of heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 resulted in higher levels of both full-length and truncated protein than the inclusion of homologous ITR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F3">3</xref>B and C). However this was not observed when HEK293 cells were infected with the same dual AAV vector preps based on the transgene titre (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F3">3</xref>B and D). In conclusion, the ratio between full-length and truncated protein expression was similar regardless of the ITR included in the vectors and of the vector titre used to dose cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F3">3</xref>C and D).

Thus, the degradation signal will be included in the truncated but not in the full-length protein which results from a spliced mRNA. As degradation signals in the 5&#x02032;-half vectors we have included: (i) the CL1 degron (CL1), (ii) four copies of the miR-let7b target site (4&#x000d7;let7b), (iii) four copies of the miR-26a target site (4&#x000d7;26a) or (iv) the combination of three copies each of miR-204 and miR-124 target sites (3&#x000d7;204 + 3&#x000d7;124) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV386TB2">2</xref>).

To define the concentration of miR mimics required to achieve silencing of a gene containing the corresponding miR target sites, we used a plasmid encoding for the reporter EGFP protein and containing the miR target sites before the polyadenylation signal (data not shown). The same experimental settings were used for further evaluation of the miR target sites in the context of dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors. We found that inclusion of miR-204 + 124 and 26a target sequences in the 5&#x02032;-half of dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors reduced albeit did not abolish the expression of the truncated protein products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F4">4</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>).

Four weeks after the injection, we analysed the corresponding retinal cryosections under a fluorescence microscope. EGFP fluorescence quantification in the PR cell layer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3a and b</ext-link>) showed that both promoters give comparable levels of PR transduction (predominantly rods in this region). However, when we counted the number of cones labelled with an antibody raised against cone arrestin (CAR) (<xref rid="DDV386C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) that were also EGFP-positive, we found higher although not statistically significant levels of cone PR transduction with the GRK1 promoter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C and D</ext-link>). Based on this, we included the GRK1 promoter in our improved dual AAV hybrid <italic>ABCA4</italic> vectors, and investigated their ability to both express <italic>ABCA4</italic> and decrease the abnormal content of autofluorescent lipofuscin material in the RPE of <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice. We initially injected subretinally 1 month-old C57/BL6 mice with improved dual AAV vectors (dose of each vector/eye: 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> GC) and found that 12 out of 24 (50%) injected eyes had detectable albeit variable levels of full-length ABCA4 protein by Western blot [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F5">5</xref>A; ABCA4 protein levels in the ABCA4-positive eyes: 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.7 a.u.

This is similar to our previous finding that a different version of the dual AAV platform resulted in 50% ABCA4-expressing eyes (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

However, recently, several groups, including ours, have independently reported effective delivery of large genes to both the mouse and pig retina by dual AAV vectors (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), thus expanding their applicability to diseases like STGD1 due to mutations in genes with a CDS which exceeds the canonical AAV cargo capacity. Here we set-up to overcome some limitations associated with the use of dual AAV vectors, namely their relatively low efficiency when compared with a single vector, and the production of truncated proteins which may raise safety concerns. Strategies aiming at increasing dual AAV genome tail-to-head concatemerization should in theory increase the levels of full-length and reduce those of truncated proteins from free single half-vectors. We set to improve tail-to-head dual AAV hybrid genome concatemerization by including either optimal regions of homology or heterologous ITR. In a side-by-side evaluation of previously described regions of homology, we have found that the AP1 and AP2 sequences recently published by Lostal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDV386C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and the AK sequence from the F1 phage (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) drive overall similar levels of protein expression <italic>in vitro</italic>, with dual AAV hybrid AK vectors driving efficient <italic>ABCA4</italic> expression in the mouse retina more frequently than those with AP1 and AP2 sequences. Independently, the availability of different regions of homology will still be useful to direct proper concatemerization of triple AAV vectors which are being exploited to further expand AAV cargo capacity (<xref rid="DDV386C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 have been successfully included in dual (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and triple (<xref rid="DDV386C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) AAV vectors. We found that, although the genome of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 is homogeneous in size, the yields of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 are lower than those of vectors with homologous ITR2. We also detected less vector genomes with heterologous ITR when we probe their ITR2 than when we probe a different region of their genome. As we show that Rep5 interferes with production of vectors with ITR2, this suggests anomalies at the level of ITR2 included in AAV vectors with heterologous ITR, which are produced in the presence of Rep5, but not in AAV vectors with homologous ITR2, which are produced only in the presence of Rep2 and that showed similar titres whether we probed ITR2 or a different region of the genome. In addition, regardless of the titre used to perform the infections, inclusion of heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 in dual AAV hybrid vectors did not result in significant increase in the rates of full-length to truncated protein production. These results partly differ from those previously reported where dual AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 had higher transduction efficiency than vectors with homologous ITRs and apparently no production issues (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Besides the different packaging constructs and production protocols, in this study we used dual AAV hybrid vectors which included regions of homology between the two half-vectors as opposed to the trans-splicing (TS) system used in the previous reports which simply relies on the ITR for concatemerization (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). As in dual AAV hybrid vectors the reconstitution of the full-length gene is mainly mediated by the region of homology included in the vectors (<xref rid="DDV386C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) which directs concatemer formation, this may account for the lack in the increase in transgene expression we observed with vectors with heterologous ITR compared with the previous studies that used TS vectors (<xref rid="DDV386C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The production of truncated protein products from single half-vectors of dual AAV might raise safety concerns and we aimed at overcoming this by including various degradation signals in our dual AAV vectors. The inclusion of miR target sites in the transcript of a gene has been shown to be an effective strategy to knock-down and restrict transgene expression in various tissues, including the retina (<xref rid="DDV386C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, we achieved only a partial reduction of truncated protein production with miR target sites. Although we cannot rule out that miR target sites lead to a more effective silencing in the mouse retina than <italic>in vitro</italic>, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that features of the mRNA external to the miR target sites rather than miRNA levels might affect the efficiency of the silencing. Indeed, while miR mimics provide robust silencing of a canonical EGFP expression cassette containing the miR target sites, this silencing was less robust when we tested the same mimics with dual AAV ABCA4 vectors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F4">4</xref>A). Along this line, since the truncated protein products that derive from the 5&#x02032;-half are produced from a vector that is not endowed with a canonical polyadenilation signal, it may be possible that the resulting mRNA cannot undergo an efficient miR-mediated silencing (<xref rid="DDV386C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="DDV386C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we achieved complete degradation of the truncated protein product from the 5&#x02032;-half vector by inclusion of the CL1 degron. We showed that this signal is effective both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the pig retina, indicating that the enzymes of the degradative pathway required for CL1 activity are expressed in various cell types. On the other hand, we found that none of the degradation signals tested in the 3&#x02032;-half vectors significantly reduced truncated protein expression without affecting full-length protein expression. In addition, we found a negative correlation between the length of the degradation signal included in the 3&#x02032;-half vector and the levels of protein expression, possibly indicating that increasing the size of the sequences between the ITR and the splicing acceptor signal interferes with mRNA processing. However, we could never abolish truncated protein formation from the 3&#x02032;-half vectors even using different lengths of degradation sequences. Since 3&#x02032;-half vectors do not have a canonical promoter with a defined transcription start site, it is possible that start codons downstream of the region of the vector where we included the degradation signals are recognized more efficiently than the ATG of the degradation signals. This would result in exclusion of the degradation signal from the truncated proteins. As the truncated protein product from the 3&#x02032;-half vector is less abundant than that produced by the 5&#x02032;-half vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV386F4">4</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>), its presence should raise less safety concerns. Indeed, although further formal toxicity studies are required to finally address this issue, data presented here in the mouse and pig retina support the safety of improved dual AAV vectors.</p><p>Notably, we found that subretinal administration of improved dual AAV vectors, under the control of the GRK1 promoter, which provides high levels of combined rod and cone transduction, results in effective ABCA4 delivery in mice, although at variable levels. This could be due to both the inherent variability of the subretinal injection in the small murine eye and the overall lower efficacy of the dual AAV system compared with a single AAV vector (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite this variability, we found that dual AAV mediated ABCA4 delivery results in significant lipofuscin reduction in the <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> retina suggesting that a wide range of transgene expression levels can similarly contribute to therapeutic efficacy. This was observed using two independent techniques, however, more pronounced improvement of the phenotype was observed when we dissected and analysed the AAV transduced area of the retina that indeed showed normalization of the number of lipofuscin granules. HPLC measurement of A2E, the major lipofuscin granules component, has been used to assess the efficacy of therapies in <italic>Abca4&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice (<xref rid="DDV386C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDV386C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). However, we found these measurements to be inconsistent in our hands, even between affected and normal retinas (data not shown), thus we were not able to use this technique in our rescue experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, our study characterized dual AAV vectors with improved features in view of their potential future clinical application to the therapy of STGD1. In addition, our findings can be used to improve dual AAV vectors for gene therapy of other conditions due to mutations in genes with a CDS which exceeds AAV cargo capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of plasmids</title><p>The plasmids used for AAV vector production were all derived from dual AAV hybrid AK vector plasmids encoding for the human <italic>ABCA4</italic> gene containing the ITR of AAV serotype 2 (<xref rid="DDV386C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
