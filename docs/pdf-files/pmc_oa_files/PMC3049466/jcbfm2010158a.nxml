We show that concurrent two-photon fluorescence imaging of endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and the cortical microcirculation exposes well-defined boundaries of tissue oxygen diffusion in the mouse cortex. The NADH fluorescence increases rapidly over a narrow, very low pO<sub>2</sub> range with a <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>50</italic></sub> of 3.4&#x000b1;0.6&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, thereby establishing a nearly binary reporter of significant, metabolically limiting hypoxia. The transient cortical tissue boundaries of NADH fluorescence exhibit remarkably delineated geometrical patterns, which define the limits of tissue oxygen diffusion from the cortical microcirculation and bear a striking resemblance to the ideal Krogh tissue cylinder. The visualization of microvessels and their regional contribution to oxygen delivery establishes penetrating arterioles as major oxygen sources in addition to the capillary network and confirms the existence of cortical oxygen fields with steep microregional oxygen gradients. Thus, two-photon NADH imaging can be applied to expose vascular supply regions and to localize functionally relevant microregional cortical hypoxia with micrometer spatial resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Krogh cylinder</kwd><kwd>microregional hypoxia</kwd><kwd>NADH</kwd><kwd>oxygen diffusion</kwd><kwd>penetrating arterioles</kwd><kwd>vascular supply regions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental impediment to the current investigation of cortical function is the uncertain causality between changes in neural activity, cerebral blood flow, and tissue oxygenation under nonactivated and activated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>).

All mice were used at age 10 to 12 weeks. C57Bl6 and Eno2-YFP/Cox8a mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1&#x00025; to 1.5&#x00025;) and ventilated through a facemask. FVB mice were anesthetized with ketamine (0.12&#x02009;mg/g intraperitoneally) and xylazine (0.01&#x02009;mg/g intraperitoneally) and ventilated through a tracheostomy using a small animal ventilator (SAR-830, CWE Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) set at 100&#x02009;breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.3 to 0.4&#x02009;mL. The body temperature was maintained using a water-flow heating pad (TP-500, Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY, USA) and a temperature controller (ACT1000, WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA). The femoral artery was cannulated for measurements of systemic blood pressure (BLPR2/SYS-BP1, WPI Inc.) and blood gases (Ciba-Corning 238, GMI Inc., Ramsey, MN, USA). Blood gases in our mice were pO<sub>2</sub>=108&#x000b1;8&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, pCO<sub>2</sub>=33&#x000b1;5&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, and pH=7.32&#x000b1;0.03 (average&#x000b1;s.d., <italic>n</italic>=6). Optical access to the cortex was provided through a parietal craniectomy (diameter 3 to 4&#x02009;mm centered at bregma &#x02212;0.5&#x02009;mm, lateral 3&#x02009;mm). A metal plate was glued to the skull, the dura mater removed, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mmol/L) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, and 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4, was applied. The window was covered with 2&#x00025; agarose dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 37&#x000b0;C and a 0.17-mm glass coverslip. For the purpose of two-photon microangiographies the femoral vein was injected with Texas-Red-dextran (MW 70&#x02009;kDa, D1830, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Bright Field Imaging of the Pial Vasculature</title><p>Cranial window-prepared mice were mounted on the microscope stage.

Bright field images of the cortex were captured using a CMOS camera (Moticam 1000, Motic, Xiamen, China) at &#x000d7; 4 NA 0.13 air objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; UPlanFLN) and a &#x000d7; 10 NA 0.45 (Zeiss C-Apochromat, Oberkochen, Germany) water-immersion objective. Pial arterioles and venules were identified by direction of blood flow, color, and branching pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-Photon Imaging of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide and the Microcirculation</title><p>We used an Olympus Fluoview1000-AOM or Fluoview300 multiphoton imaging system with femtosecond Ti:Sa lasers as excitation sources (Spectra-Physics MaiTai or MaiTaiHP Deep See). For imaging, we used &#x000d7; 10 NA 0.45 (Zeiss C-Apochromat), &#x000d7; 20 NA 0.95 (Olympus XLUMPlan F), or &#x000d7; 25 NA 1.05 (Olympus XLPlan N) water-immersion objectives. Images were taken at 12-bit depth at a resolution of 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixels with a pixel dwell time of 2&#x02009;microseconds. The NADH and Texas-Red-dextran were two-photon excited at 710&#x02009;nm, YFP at 900&#x02009;nm. Fluorescence was separated from the excitation light using a dichroic mirror/near-IR-blocking filter combination (FF665-Di01; FF01-680/SP, Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA) divided into two channels using a dichroic mirror (505DCXRU, Chroma, Rockingham, VT, USA), and bandpass filtered (NADH&#x02014;Semrock FF460/80, YFP&#x02014;Chroma 535/30ET, Texas-Red-dextran&#x02014;Semrock FF607/36). All optical bandpass filters are specified according to the manufacturer's convention &#x02018;center wavelength/filter bandwidth'. Two-photon microangiographies were taken from the pial surface down to layer IV using 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m <italic>z</italic>-steps. Concurrent two-photon imaging of NADH and the vasculature was performed at imaging depths ranging from 50 to 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m. The laser power after the objective was kept below 10&#x02009;mW. To conduct four-color imaging of neurons, astrocytes, microvessels, and NADH in the cortex, we used transgenic mice with expression of YFP in a subset of cortical neurons (Jackson Labs, B6.Cg-TgN(Thy1-YFPH)2Jrs). We labeled astrocytes in these mice by topically application of the astrocyte-specific dye sulforhodamine 101 (5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L in artificial cerebrospinal fluid, Sigma S7635, St Louis, MO, USA), and labeled the blood serum by injecting red fluorescent (655&#x02009;nm) water-soluble quantum dots (Invitrogen, Q21021MP) into the femoral vein.</p></sec><sec><title>Whisker Stimulation, Hypoxemia, Electrophysiology, Measurement of Tissue Oxygen, and Cerebral Blood Flow</title><p>We induced neural activity in the barrel cortex with electrical whisker stimulation using repeated 5&#x02009;Hz trains, with a duration of 20&#x02009;seconds separated by a 2-minute interval during an 8-minute period. Pulses (1.2&#x02009;mA, 0.3&#x02009;milliseconds) were generated using a stimulator/isolation unit (Master8/ISO-Flex, AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel) and applied through two insulated electrodes (E363/1, Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) placed against the lower posterior quadrant of the whisker field. Extracellular recordings of the local field potential and the DC potential were obtained through patch pipettes (TW150F-4, WPI) with a tip diameter of 2 to 3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m. The electrodes were filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and placed in the imaging plane in cortical layer I at a depth of 50 to 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m. The local field potential signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), bandpass filtered at 1 to 100&#x02009;Hz, and digitized at 20&#x02009;kHz (Digidata 1320, Axon Instruments). For measurement of cerebral blood flow, we used a laser Doppler system, with a 1-mm needle probe (BLF21, Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA) that was placed above the barrel cortex. For direct oxygen measurements in layer I, we used customized Clark-type electrodes, with a fast response time and a 3 to 4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m tip diameter (Unisense A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). These oxygen electrodes were calibrated before each experiment in saline equilibrated with room air (21&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>) and a solution of ascorbate in NaOH (0&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>). Experimental hypoxemia was induced by lowering the oxygen concentration in the inspired air from 21&#x00025; to 10&#x00025; for a period of 120&#x02009;seconds.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title><p>Intrinsic fluorescence from cortical layer I was two-photon excited at 710&#x02009;nm, focused into a 1-mm diameter multimode fiber and coupled into a cooled spectrometer (BWT1112E, B&#x00026;W-Tek Inc. Newark, DE, USA). Reference spectra of purified &#x000df;-NADH (Sigma, N9410-15VL) in aqueous solution and bound to mitochondrial malate-dehydrogenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ, USA) were taken at 340&#x02009;nm excitation using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Image Processing and Visualization</title><p>We performed image analysis using Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Thus, we digitally registered bright field images of the pial vasculature with the corresponding two-photon microangiographies.

For three-dimensional reconstructions of the Texas-Red-dextran labeled cerebral vasculature, we intensity adjusted the <italic>z</italic>-stacks, Fourier filtered, and visualized them using maximum intensity projections. We restricted image analysis to averaging subsequent images with calculation of the mean and the s.d. for each pixel, and normalizing the 12-bit pixel intensities of the Fluoview1000 images to a continuous gray-intensity scale ranging from 0 to 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Curve Fitting and Statistical Analysis</title><p>We used OriginPro 8 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) software to create graphs, for curve fitting, and statistical testing.

Using a combined multiphoton imaging and spectroscopy setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we acquired fluorescence emission spectra from layer I on two-photon excitation at 710&#x02009;nm. To minimize the interference from hemoglobin absorption, we took the spectra from tissue volumes that were free of large blood vessels. The bounded position of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, black plot, avg.&#x000b1;s.d from six mice) between the spectrum of free, aqueous NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red plot) and the blue-shifted spectrum of NADH bound to mitochondrial malate-dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue plot) shows that intracellular NADH in the neocortex exists in equilibrium between free and protein-bound molecules, in analogy to the hippocampal neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vishwasrao <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The strong congruity of the spectra depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> establishes that intrinsic signal is essentially pure pyridine nucleotide fluorescence with spectrally indistinguishable fractions from NADH and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). As NADH contributes &#x0223c;86&#x00025; and NADPH contributes only &#x0223c;14&#x00025; to the total tissue concentrations of the reduced pyridine nucleotides in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klaidman <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), the intrinsic tissue fluorescence can be interpreted as predominately representing NADH and thus as a specific reporter for neural energy metabolism.</p><p>As the next step, we calibrated the NADH fluorescence intensity in layer I as a function of tissue oxygenation by concurrent NADH imaging and Clark electrode oxygen measurements during experimentally induced hypoxemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Controlled hypoxemia was induced by gradual reduction of the oxygen concentration in the ventilated gas mixture from 21&#x00025; to 0&#x00025;. The inverse relationship between NADH fluorescence and oxygen becomes obvious when plotting the tissue fluorescence as a function of the extracellular oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The NADH fluorescence remained first unchanged, with decreasing tissue oxygen levels from 25 to 10&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg and eventually exhibited an abrupt increase at extracellular tissue oxygen levels below 10&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg. Our measurements of the oxygen dependence of NADH fluorescence in mouse cortex are consistent with previously published studies on mitochondrial metabolism in cultured cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilson <italic>et al</italic> (1979<italic>a</italic>)</xref> reported that there is little change in intramitochondrial (NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH) until very low oxygen tensions are reached. It was also reported that the respiratory rate is essentially independent of oxygen concentrations above 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M (&#x0223c;12&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg), which is in full agreement with the flat slope of our calibration curve between 10 and 25&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg. Mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>, 1979b</xref>) suggested that mitochondrial (NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH) may still be weakly dependent on oxygen concentration at higher concentrations throughout the entire physiological range up to 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M (&#x0223c;120&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg), albeit with a slope much less than that noted below 10&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg.</p><p>The red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the fit of the sigmoidal Boltzmann function (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.99) to these measurements.

The oxygen tension <italic>p</italic><sub>50</sub> for half-maximum NADH fluorescence indicates loss of respiratory chain function and mitochondrial ATP production and is equivalent to the critical extracellular oxygen tension for the brain. Our estimate of the critical extracellular oxygen tension of 3.4&#x000b1;0.6&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg is in good agreement with a previous report of critical oxygen tensions in the brain of 1 to 3&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MacMillan and Siesj&#x000f6;, 1971</xref>) and also with the reported <italic>p</italic><sub>50</sub> for mitochondrial oxidation reduction of 2.5&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hull and Foster, 2001</xref>).

The NADH fluorescence levels within the tissue patches were 48&#x00025; to 58&#x00025; elevated with respect to adjacent tissue with uniformly low NADH fluorescence. We could consistently unmask these tissue patches with short (20&#x02009;seconds) episodes of mild hypoxemia that we induced by lowering the oxygen concentration in the ventilated gas mixture from 21&#x00025; to 15&#x00025; oxygen. Electrophysiological recordings under these conditions revealed a transient silencing of the spontaneous electrical activity with only minimal shifts of the DC potential (Supplementary Figure S1). The stability of the DC potential excludes pathological conditions like anoxic depolarization or spreading depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takano <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), as underlying causes for the observed NADH patches. Possible confounding effects of anesthesia were addressed by using two fundamentally different regimes (isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine). The NADH tissue patches were consistently observed under both regimens, and they did not respond to changes in anesthetic depth.</p><p>To answer the question whether the inhomogeneous NADH tissue fluorescence is related to the distribution of neuronal mitochondria in the neuropil of layer I or is an independent signal, we used transgenic mice with pan-cortical, neuron-specific expression of mitochondrially targeted YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Misgeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). These mice offer the unique opportunity to directly compare the distributions of NADH fluorescence and neuronal mitochondria in the same cortical region. In stark contrast to the described heterogeneities in the NADH tissue fluorescence, the spatial distribution of YFP fluorescence from neuronal mitochondria was homogenous, regardless of their location within the vascular bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The even distribution of neuronal mitochondria described here is consistent with a regionally uniform metabolic rate for oxygen in layer I. In contrast, the sharply delineated, dark appearance of the cortical blood vessels in both the NADH and mitochondrial YFP fluorescence images can be attributed to the high two-photon absorptivity of hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clay <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further delineate the apparent spatial relationship between NADH tissue patches and the microcirculation, we digitally superimposed pseudocolored arterioles (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and venules (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) over the raw NADH image (grayscale, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The montage highlights distinct circular indentations (yellow sketches) and linear borders (orange sketches) of the NADH tissue patches. These NADH tissue patches were always located in tissue areas distant to regional blood vessels, notably at greater distances to arterioles than to venules. We further conducted four-compartment fluorescence imaging of NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) under resting conditions, with 21&#x00025; inspired oxygen to investigate whether the NADH patches were related to the distribution of cellular elements in the neuropil of layer I. However, the superimposition of all four fluorescence channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) did not reveal any association of NADH patches to astrocytes or neuronal processes in layer I, whereas it confirmed their strong geometrical association with neighboring blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F&#x02013;3H</xref>). The described geometry is instantly recognizable and consistent with an underlying relationship to oxygen supply from the vascular bed. Thus, the boundaries of the tissue patches could be related to the perimeter of oxygen diffusion from neighboring microvessels. We interpreted these tissue NADH patches as hypoxic (pO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;3.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg) watershed areas and asked whether similar patterns could be observed in the physiologically activated brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Unmasking of the Krogh Tissue Cylinder</title><p>Focal neural activity in the barrel cortex was induced by intermittent whisker stimulation using 20&#x02009;second trains at 5&#x02009;Hz and validated by recording of well-described neurovascular responses in layer I (Supplementary Figure S2), specifically bursts of local field potentials, the hemodynamic response, and the previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) biphasic change in tissue oxygenation. We applied five intermittent 20&#x02009;second trains separated by 2&#x02009;minute-intervals during an 8-minute period. The microregional intensity distribution of the time-averaged NADH tissue fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) in layer I appeared homogenous. However, we frequently observed evanescent, spatially confined NADH transients delineated by conspicuous circular borders. These microregional fluctuations emerged at various times during the stimulation period, some appeared spontaneously, whereas others were correlated with the applied stimuli. To quantitatively isolate such metabolically labile regions, we computed the s.d. for each pixel of the time series. The visualization of the s.d. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) reveals a distinctively geometrical tissue pattern, which is consistent with two intersecting circles. Their boundaries are defined by the visible, steep transition from low to high s.d., and they effectively separate inner regions with stable NADH fluorescence from outer regions with fluctuating NADH fluorescence. To determine the radius <italic>R</italic> of the described tissue circles, we measured their radial pixel intensity values within a well-defined segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Details of this complex measurement are provided in the Supplementary Text. We then fitted a sigmoidal function (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) to the radial intensity profile (blue symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and used its inflection point, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, as a definition of <italic>R</italic>.

The influential concept of the Krogh tissue cylinder was proposed in 1919 as a mathematical description of radial oxygen diffusion from capillaries into skeletal muscle, and it has provided the groundwork for many subsequent models of tissue oxygen supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thews, 1960<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Popel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). On the basis of the strong geometrical analogy to the Krogh cylinder, we hypothesized that boundaries between tissue regions with steady and fluctuating NADH fluorescence represent the perimeter of radial oxygen diffusion from the central blood vessel into the surrounding neuropil. In this scenario, the cylindrical NADH tissue boundary is the physical equivalent of the second boundary condition of the Krogh model, which is defined as the point where the microregional tissue pO<sub>2</sub> approximates the critical oxygen tension <italic>p</italic><sub>50</sub> necessary to sustain mitochondrial respiration. In this transitional zone, minute fluctuations in vascular supply or microregional tissue utilization of oxygen will lead to toggling between zero-order and first-order oxygen metabolism with oscillations between low and high NADH fluorescence levels. Consequently, the radius <italic>R</italic> of the cylindrical NADH boundary must be defined by the competition between vascular oxygen delivery through diffusion and the tissue metabolic rate for oxygen.

In other words, the central penetrating arteriole is implied as the sole oxygen source for the entire tissue cylinder and consequently any further vessels within the tissue cylinder must be absent. To test this strong prediction, we conducted high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of the cerebral microvasculature encompassing cortical layers I to IV. Indeed, these reconstructions consistently revealed a complete absence of the otherwise dense cortical capillary network in the vicinity of penetrating arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A&#x02013;6D</xref>) extending over several hundred micrometers along the length axis of penetrating arterioles.

This allowed us to directly test our interpretation of NADH tissue boundaries as oxygen diffusion boundaries by subjecting the mice to controlled hypoxemia. We therefore lowered the inspired oxygen concentration from 21&#x00025; to 10&#x00025; for a period of 2&#x02009;minutes. The resulting drop of the pO<sub>2</sub> in the femoral artery from the physiological value of 108&#x000b1;9 to 49&#x000b1;11&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (avg.&#x000b1;s.d., <italic>n</italic>=6 mice) is sufficient to induce moderate hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu and LaManna, 2006</xref>) in the cerebral cortex. As predicted, moderate hypoxia led to an increase in NADH fluorescence, which was spatially highly heterogeneous. The first changes noted were the appearance of NADH tissue patches in tissue regions distant to blood vessels. These anoxic microwatershed zones gradually expanded towards perivascular tissue regions, unmasking numerous isolated pericapillary tissue cylinders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

However, we cannot directly relate polarographic measurements to inferred oxygen gradients because the exact three-dimensional location of the electrode tip with respect to nearby microvessels is unknown. Thus, direct electrode measurements cannot be assigned to a specific vascular supply region with certainty. A further assignment to a defined position within a given vascular supply region seem even more problematic, especially when considering the uncertainties regarding the sensitive volume of oxygen electrodes.</p><p>With <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> &#x0223c;3.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">equation (7)</xref> yields average vascular oxygen tensions of 94&#x000b1;18&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (s.d.) for arterioles, 28&#x000b1;11&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg for capillaries, and 38&#x000b1;13&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg for venules in cortical layer I under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, top).

We observed capillary oxygen levels slightly below venous oxygen tension as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vovenko, 1999</xref>). Possible explanations could be the existence of arterio-venous shunting in the cortical circulation or more likely a selection bias caused by the masking of pericapillary NADH gradients because of highly overlapping capillary oxygen supply regions in well-oxygenated tissue volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Bassingthwaigthe, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Using our model, we can provide a quantitative description of the complex changes in cortical oxygenation between normoxia (Pa<sub>2</sub> 108&#x000b1;9&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg) and moderate cortical hypoxia (Pa<sub>2</sub> 49&#x000b1;11&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg).

We can further quantify the radial shrinkage of vascular supply regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) and diminished tissue oxygen gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Notably, complete tissue cylinders with diameters of &#x0223c;60 to 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m surrounding penetrating arterioles remain adequately oxygenated under hypoxemic conditions.

The reason is that both metabolic states 4 and 5 (rate limiting hypoxia) are characterized by high levels of NADH. However, state 4 is aerobic, whereas state 5 is anaerobic. Thus, tissue in state 4 would not exhibit the cylindrical geometry of an oxygen diffusion boundary observed in our experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Advantages and Limitations of Our Approach</title><p>The Krogh model is a steady-state model and does not afford a measure of cerebral blood flow.

The concern is that capillary domains, which are a descriptive measure of capillary spacing, and associated capillary supply regions are not congruent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Bassingthwaigthe, 2001</xref>). Thus, a more uniform oxygen distribution would be expected, challenging the wide span of tissue oxygen levels as predicted by the Krogh model. However, refined mathematical descriptions with objectively measured vascular geometries and flow relationships are frequently beyond analytical solutions and have not yet afforded a significantly improved correlation with experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thews, 1960<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fletcher, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mintun <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).

This difficulty is amplified by the low two-photon absorption cross-section of NADH (0.07 GM at 710&#x02009;nm), which is 1/100 to 1/1000 the magnitude of conventional fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasischke <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

Under such conditions, cortical oxygenation must be closely regulated within the limits of normal brain function and any focal increase in the cerebral metabolic rate or a reduction in vascular oxygen supply would inevitably increase the likelihood of hypoxia in cortical watershed regions. Microregional tissue hypoxia would also contribute to elevated lactate levels in the focally stimulated brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prichard <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sappey-Marinier <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). In this context, our results raise the question whether the watershed areas observed under our cranial window preparations are physiological phenomena and may further be related to the natural function of the cerebrovascular control system.</p><p>For example, the possibility that mitochondria sense a declining oxygen tension and directly or indirectly trigger a blood flow increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gjedde, 2002</xref>) is in agreement with recent studies that have posited a regulatory role for the redox state of neural cells on cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ido <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vlassenko <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The cellular redox state is determined by the cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ratio, which exists in near-equilibrium with the intracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio. Thus, the proposed mechanism is that increased cytosolic NADH will increase the electron transfer from NADH to oxidized enzymes in signaling pathways that activate constitutive nitric oxide synthase to increase cerebral blood flow. Under hypoxic conditions, cytosolic NADH will be maximally elevated because of increased anaerobic glycolysis and cessation of its reoxidation to NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> by mitochondrial electron shuttling. In this scenario, microregional tissue patches with elevated NADH levels would activate signaling cascades, which increase cerebral blood flow with a subsequent increase in microregional tissue oxygen levels, ultimately linking tissue metabolic states to the hemodynamic response.</p><p>Future applications of concurrent two-photon fluorescence imaging of endogenous NADH and the cortical microcirculation may allow for the inclusive investigation of neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling and expose the role of inadequate or restricted tissue oxygen supply in neurovascular diseases and the aging brain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &#x00026; Metabolism website (http://www.nature.com/jcbfm)</p></fn><fn><p>This study was supported by the DANA foundation (Brain and Immunoimaging Program), the American Heart Association (0635595T), the ALS Association (&#x00023;1112), NIH-NINDS (NS38073, NS50315), and NIH-NCI (CA68409).</p></fn></fn-group><notes><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buchweitz</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Shina</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><year>1980</year><article-title>Cerebral oxygen consumption and supply in anesthetized cat</article-title><source>Science</source><volume>209</volume><fpage>499</fpage><lpage>501</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7394515</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buxton</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name></person-group><year>1997</year><article-title>A model for the coupling between cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism during neural stimulation</article-title><source>J Cereb Blood Flow Metab</source><volume>17</volume><fpage>64</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8978388</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chance</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year>1957</year><article-title>Cellular oxygen requirements</article-title><source>Fed Proc</source><volume>16</volume><fpage>671</fpage><lpage>680</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13480340</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chance</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jobsis</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoener</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year>1962</year><article-title>Intracellular oxidation-reduction states <italic>in vivo</italic></article-title><source>Science</source><volume>137</volume><fpage>499</fpage><lpage>507</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13878016</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chance</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name></person-group><year>1955</year><article-title>Respiratory enzymes in oxidative phosphorylation.

(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the combined two-photon imaging and spectroscopy setup used to acquire the images, spectroscopy, and oxygen measurements from mouse cortical layer I.

This spectrum lies bounded between the spectra of free NADH (red plot) and protein-bound NADH (blue plot). (<bold>C</bold>) To determine the relationship between NADH fluorescence and tissue oxygenation, we concurrently imaged NADH fluorescence (red plot) and directly measured the tissue oxygenation (blue plot) with Clark electrodes. We induced hypoxemia by reducing the oxygen fraction of the inspired gas mixture from 21&#x00025; to 0&#x00025; at a rate of &#x0223c;16&#x00025; over 10&#x02009;seconds.
