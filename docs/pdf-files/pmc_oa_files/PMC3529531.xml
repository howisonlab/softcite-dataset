For example, the constriction of the apical membrane in a group of epithelial cells leads to their invagination, a mechanism that is used in diverse developmental programs, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> gastrulation or neural tube formation in vertebrates. Although we are beginning to understand the molecular machinery controlling apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012</xref>), it remains unclear how the formation of squamous and columnar epithelia is regulated.</p><p>Morphogenesis of a columnar epithelium from cuboidal precursors involves the expansion of the lateral membrane. In contrast, formation of squamous epithelia requires shrinking of the lateral membrane and expansion of the apical and basal membranes. It is unclear how these changes in membrane size and cell shape are regulated. Previous studies suggest roles for cell junctions and the cytoskeleton. It has been shown that the reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in the stretching of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> amnioserosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pope and Harris, 2008</xref>). A potential role of actin&#x02013;Myosin-based contractility in preventing cell stretching can be deduced from data in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium, where cells lacking Myosin function undergo a transition from a cuboidal to squamous cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>). The same phenotype was observed when the function of adherens junctions is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">M&#x000fc;ller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanentzapf et al., 2000</xref>). The finding that compromised cell adhesion results in cell flattening suggests that squamous cell morphogenesis can be induced by reducing adhesion between cells. This raises the possibility that epithelial cells control the size of their lateral membrane by regulating the abundance or localization of cell adhesion molecules. An increase in the number of adhesion molecules could lead to an expansion of the lateral membrane, whereas their reduction allows membrane shrinking.</p><p>Two important protein families mediating cell adhesion are cadherins and immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. A prominent member of the latter family is N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) and its insect homologue Fas2 (Fasciclin 2), which mediate homophilic interactions in the extracellular space. E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junctions, the site of apicolateral cell contacts. The extracellular part of E-cadherin connects neighboring cells, whereas its intracellular part serves as an anchoring point for the actin cytoskeleton and several other proteins, including &#x003b2;-Catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris and Tepass, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baum and Georgiou, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial morphogenesis can be studied in the follicular epithelium of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. This organ is composed of follicles of different ages, which are subdivided into 14 different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005</xref>). Follicles or egg chambers consist of an inner cyst of germline cells (made of 15 nurse cells and one oocyte) surrounded by a monolayered follicular epithelium with initially cuboidal-shaped cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201207150/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). During early oogenesis, the germline cyst grows in size, leading to a volume increase that is accommodated by cell divisions in the epithelium. This changes after stage 6 when cell divisions cease because of the expression of Delta in the germline activating Notch signaling in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">L&#x000f3;pez-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</xref>). Although the germline cyst continues to increase its volume after stage 6, the epithelium undergoes morphogenesis and subdivides into an anterior squamous and a posterior columnar part (Fig. S1 B). As a result, egg chambers develop with a posterior columnar epithelium covering the oocyte and an anterior squamous epithelium consisting of large and flat cells covering the nurse cells.</p><p>Morphometric analysis and mechanical modeling suggest that the growth of the inner cyst is a critical force for the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolahi et al. (2009)</xref> propose a model in which the volume increase of the inner cyst exerts a tensile force on the outer epithelium inducing flattening of cells specifically in anterior epithelium. In the posterior epithelium, this force is counteracted by the apical actin cytoskeleton, which is organized by &#x003b2;-Spectrin and contracted by Myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>). Anterior cells are unable to counteract cyst pressure and flatten. A possible reason for their inability to resist pressure is the locally restricted disassembly of their adherens junctions at positions where three or four cells meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grammont, 2007</xref>). As the adherens junctions anchor the actin cytoskeleton, their local breakdown could destabilize the apical actin network and trigger cell flattening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolahi et al., 2009</xref>). Adherens junction disassembly proceeds from anterior to the middle region of the follicle concomitant with stretching, suggesting a critical role for squamous cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grammont, 2007</xref>). It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for adherens junction breakdown during stretching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grammont, 2007</xref>), but other genes contributing to epithelial stretching are unknown. Here, we identify the gene <italic>Tao</italic> as a critical regulator for squamous cell morphogenesis.</p><p>The Ser/Thr kinase Tao has been shown to activate the stress-responsive MAPK pathway in mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hutchison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raman et al., 2007</xref>). Tao uses the same pathway in cultured hippocampal neurons to trigger endocytosis of N-cadherin in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>). A biochemical study isolated Tao because of its ability to phosphorylate Par-1, a kinase regulating microtubule dynamics and cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Timm et al., 2003</xref>). Analysis of <italic>Tao</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed functions in controlling microtubule plus-end growth in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), in regulating apoptosis of germ cells in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2007</xref>), and in the development of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">King et al., 2011</xref>). Two recent studies show that Tao is also involved in growth regulation of imaginal discs, in which Tao activates the Salvador&#x02013;Warts&#x02013;Hippo (SWH) pathway by phosphorylating Hippo kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boggiano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poon et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we report the generation of a <italic>Tao</italic> allele lacking kinase activity, which allowed us to study a new function of <italic>Tao</italic> in regulating morphogenesis of the follicular epithelium. <italic>Tao</italic> reduces lateral adhesion between epithelial cells by promoting Fas2 endocytosis. Decreased cell adhesion permits shrinking of the lateral membrane and initiates the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tao is required for follicle cell morphogenesis</title><p>We have identified Tao protein in a biochemical screen for proteins that are phosphorylated by Par-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Riechmann and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>). To identify a possible function of Tao during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, we performed an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) screen, in which we generated one chromosome with a point mutation in the second exon of the <italic>Tao</italic> gene (<italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic>), resulting in a premature stop codon at aa 64. The predicted protein harbors only a 37-aa fragment of the kinase domain lacking its active site. As homozygous <italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic> mutants are lethal, we recombined the mutation onto a FLP recombination target (FRT) chromosome to generate genetic mosaics with the FRT/FLP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu and Rubin, 1993</xref>). Par-1 controls the establishment of the anterior&#x02013;posterior axis of the oocyte by polarizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is necessary for the localization of Oskar to the posterior pole of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shulman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tomancak et al., 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, neither Oskar localization nor microtubule polarity is affected in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant oocytes, indicating that <italic>Tao</italic> is not necessary for establishment of anterior&#x02013;posterior polarity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201207150/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>).</p><p>Closer inspection of egg chambers with <italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic> mutant cells revealed morphological defects in the follicular epithelium, which become apparent during stage 8/9 when a monolayer of cuboidal precursors is transformed into a squamous anterior and a columnar posterior epithelium. <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cell clones in the anterior part of the epithelium fail to stretch and stay cuboidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left clone).

We analyzed the subcellular localization of Tao by expressing a HA fusion protein, which also rescues morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). HA-Tao protein accumulates in the basolateral cytoplasm and at the lateral membrane of the follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tao regulates accumulation of polarity proteins at the plasma membrane</title><p>We tested whether <italic>Tao</italic> controls epithelial morphogenesis by one of its known mechanism or pathways. It has been shown that <italic>Tao</italic> regulates the SWH pathway in imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meignin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Polesello and Tapon, 2007</xref>). In the follicular epithelium, SWH signaling is involved in ceasing cell proliferation after stage 6 of oogenesis, and cell clones with loss of SWH activity show prolonged proliferation as well as aberrant localization and delayed down-regulation of Notch. Moreover, SWH mutant clones express Fasciclin 3 and Eyes absent (Eya) ectopically after stage 6. Homozygous <italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic> clones, however, reveal a normal localization of Notch, Fasciclin 3, and Eya and show no cell proliferation after stage 6 as detected by phospho&#x02013;Histone H3 stainings (<italic>n</italic> = 51; Fig. S2, B&#x02013;E). We therefore conclude that <italic>Tao</italic> is not acting via the SWH pathway in the follicular epithelium. We also ruled out that the morphogenesis defects in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells results from patterning defects in the follicular epithelium by analyzing the localization of the cell fate specification markers Eya and phospho-Mad (Fig. S2, F&#x02013;I).</p><p>In mammalian cell lines, Tao activates the p38 signaling cascade in response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hutchison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raman et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether this signaling module is activated by Tao in the follicular epithelium, we analyzed the function of five kinases that were shown to act downstream of Tao. Neither cell clones for <italic>Mpk2D/p38a</italic> and <italic>Dsor</italic> nor double mutant clones for <italic>licorne</italic> and <italic>hemipterous</italic> showed defects in follicle cell morphology (Fig. S2, J&#x02013;L). Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of p38b in the follicular epithelium did not produce defects in the follicular epithelium (unpublished data). These data suggest that <italic>Tao</italic> is unlikely to regulate morphogenesis by activating the p38 cascade.</p><p>As <italic>Tao</italic> regulates microtubule dynamics in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Timm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), we examined whether <italic>Tao</italic> controls epithelial cell shape by acting on the cytoskeleton. Careful analysis of the microtubule cytoskeleton showed no differences in the organization of microtubules between wild-type and <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells. Neither the density of &#x003b1;-Tubulin&#x02013;stained microtubules nor microtubule polarity revealed by the localization of &#x003b3;-Tubulin, Nod-lacZ, and Kinesin-lacZ is affected in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201207150/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3, A&#x02013;D</ext-link>). Moreover, <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells do not show significant differences in the distribution of F-actin, &#x003b1;-Spectrin, and Myosin activity, indicating that <italic>Tao</italic> does not act on the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S3, E and F). We therefore conclude that <italic>Tao</italic> does not regulate morphogenesis via the cytoskeleton.</p><p>To examine a possible role of Tao in cell polarity, we analyzed epithelial membrane domains, which are established by polarity proteins localizing to the apical or lateral membrane. Crumbs (Crb), Par-6, and atypical PKC (aPKC) localize to the apical membrane, whereas Discs large (Dlg), Coracle, and Fas2 distribute laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laprise and Tepass, 2011</xref>). <italic>Tao</italic> mutant follicle cells localize all aforementioned proteins correctly, indicating that the overall apicobasal polarity of the follicular epithelium is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E&#x02013;H</xref>). Analysis of the adherens junction components DE-cadherin and &#x003b2;-Catenin/Armadillo (Arm) revealed that they are present in the apicolateral region of the epithelium but accumulate at higher levels compared with neighboring wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 A</xref>). Moreover, their localization is not restricted to the apicolateral region but spreads into the apical membrane domain of <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells. The apical marker Crb, Par-6, and aPKC also accumulate at higher levels but are still restricted to their domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Among the lateral markers, only Fas2 shows an increased membrane accumulation, whereas we detected no obvious difference in Dlg and Coracle levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E, G, and H</xref>). Thus, although <italic>Tao</italic> is not essential for the establishment of membrane polarity, it regulates the accumulation proteins at the plasma membrane.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Morphogenesis defects in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells are mediated by Fas2 overaccumulation.</bold> (A&#x02013;I) Stage 9 egg chambers.

Analysis of Fas2 expression in this experiment revealed residual protein after RNAi, indicating an incomplete knockdown and providing an explanation why the rescue is not fully penetrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>, inset).</p><p>To quantify the results of the interaction screen, we measured the length of the apicobasal axis of anterior epithelial cells to calculate a mean apicobasal length proportion (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201207150/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S4</ext-link>). The mean value for wild-type versus <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells is 1.8, meaning that the mean apicobasal axis of anterior <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells is almost twice as long. This is in contrast to the mean value of 1.2 measured in egg chambers, in which <italic>Tao</italic> mutant clones and <italic>Fas2</italic> knockdown have been induced. Thus, a reduction of Fas2 protein levels suppresses the morphogenetic defects of <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells. Interestingly, <italic>Fas2</italic> knockdown in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells suppresses not only the morphological defects but also the overaccumulation of Arm at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As no other gene knockdown in our candidate approach was able to suppress <italic>Tao</italic> defects, we conclude that the overaccumulation of Fas2 protein in <italic>Tao</italic> cells is a major reason for their inability to undergo morphogenesis.</p><p>To further support that Fas2 accumulation is causing <italic>Tao</italic> morphogenesis defects, we generated <italic>Fas2 Tao</italic> double mutants by recombining a null allele (<italic>Fas2<sup>eb1112</sup></italic>) with <italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic>. Larger homozygous mutant cell clones in the follicular epithelium are lethal, suggesting an interaction of the two genes in cell viability during early oogenesis. However, we could recover small clones in stage 8/9 egg chambers, which all stretch normally (<italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I and J</xref>). Moreover, double mutant clones accumulate normal Arm protein levels at their membranes, indicating a complete rescue of the <italic>Tao</italic> phenotype. Thus, <italic>Fas2 Tao</italic> double mutant clones strongly support that the morphogenesis defects in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells are caused by Fas2 accumulation. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>Tao</italic> acts through Fas2 during epithelial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Timely controlled down-regulation of Fas2 is critical for epithelial stretching</title><p>The transmembrane protein Fas2 harbors five immunoglobulin domains, which mediate homophilic cell adhesion between the lateral membranes of follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szafranski and Goode, 2004</xref>). The homophilic adhesion properties of Fas2 suggest a simple explanation for the stretching failure of <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells: the increased accumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane results in increased cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, which prevents membrane shrinking and hence morphogenesis. As this hypothesis implies that Fas2 is lost from the lateral membrane before stretching, we reexamined Fas2 localization during morphogenesis. It has been reported that the Fas2 protein is absent from anterior follicle cells at stage 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szafranski and Goode, 2004</xref>). Our analysis of the temporal changes in Fas2 localization showed that anterior epithelial cells loose Fas2 when they are still cuboidal, indicating that down-regulation precedes stretching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This supports the idea that Fas2 has to be removed from the lateral membrane to allow stretching. Fas2 is no longer detectable in stretching follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C&#x02013;D&#x02032;</xref>), whereas DE-cadherin forms a zonula adherens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, red channel). This suggests that cell adhesion in stretching cells is mainly mediated by DE-cadherin.

However, our data indicate that <italic>Tao</italic> uses none of its known pathways to control morphogenesis. Similarly, we found no evidence that <italic>Tao</italic> regulates cell stretching via the cytoskeleton. Moreover, our results argue against a role for <italic>Tao</italic> in transcriptional repression of <italic>Fas2</italic>, indicating a function in posttranslational regulation. Indeed, our quantitative analysis of Fas2 vesicles in wild-type follicles indicates that membrane shrinking is initiated by enhanced endocytosis. <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells have a reduced ability to internalize Fas2 vesicles, contain tubular Fas2 structures typical for endocytosis defects, and show fewer endocytotic Fas2 vesicles in the cytoplasm. This indicates that the overaccumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane is caused by defective Fas2 internalization, suggesting a role for <italic>Tao</italic> in promoting endocytosis at the lateral membrane. A similar function of <italic>Tao</italic> in triggering endocytosis of homophilic adhesion proteins has been identified in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to the follicular epithelium, however, <italic>Tao</italic> is acting via the p38 MAP signaling pathway in this cell type.</p><p>Tao promotes Fas2 endocytosis not only in the anterior squamous epithelium but acts also in the posterior epithelium, whose cells become columnar by elongating their lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and H</xref>). Although it is surprising that these cells down-regulate a protein that is able to induce cell elongation, it appears that during stage 7/8, all epithelial cells clear their lateral membrane from Fas2 to allow morphogenesis. This suggests that other proteins than Fas2 are responsible for cell elongation in the posterior epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Is Tao an endocytosis promoter specific for the lateral membrane?</title><p>Endocytosis is only impaired but not blocked in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells, as they are still able to internalize reduced levels of dextran and Fas2. Consistent with this, the <italic>Tao</italic> phenotype differs from mutants affecting endocytosis in general. Although cell clones mutant for Rab5, the syntaxin family member Avalanche, and Dynamin/Shibire show severe polarity defects and massive overproliferation in the follicular epithelium (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu and Bilder, 2005</xref>), the <italic>Tao</italic> phenotype is restricted to overaccumulation of membrane proteins and cell shape defects. We therefore conclude that <italic>Tao</italic> is not a general endocytosis factor but enhances endocytosis at a critical developmental stage to allow epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>This timely controlled requirement of <italic>Tao</italic> function raises the question whether Tao expression starts just before the onset of morphogenesis or whether the protein is present also in early stages and only activated when Fas2 has to be removed from the lateral membrane. We were unable to detect endogenous Tao protein, as antibodies generated by us and others showed no specific signal in the follicular epithelium. Moreover, analysis of <italic>Tao</italic> mRNA expression does not allow unambiguous conclusions about the onset of <italic>Tao</italic> transcription in the follicular epithelium as a strong signal from the germline cyst covers the signal in the surrounding epithelium.</p><p>Using a HA fusion protein, we detected Tao protein at the lateral membrane and in the basolateral cytoplasm of the follicular epithelium. Interestingly, Tao protein accumulation appears as a gradient with the lowest levels in the apical and the highest levels in the basal region of the follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). As our rescue experiments demonstrate the functionality of the fusion protein, a gradient of endogenous Tao activity might also exist. This raises the possibility that Tao promotes endocytosis more strongly in basal regions of the lateral membrane. We speculate that there is a switch in Tao activity at the border between the lateral and the basal membrane and that the basal membrane domain is protected from Tao function. A spatial restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane could be achieved by the localization of a yet unidentified target of Tao kinase. Such a Tao mediator could exclusively localize to the lateral membrane.</p><p>The finding that not only Fas2 but also apical and apicolateral proteins, such as DE-cadherin and Crb, overaccumulate in <italic>Tao</italic> mutants might argue against a restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane. However, in the light of the dramatic change in the geometry of stretching cells, an alternative explanation for the accumulation of these proteins seems more likely. Squamous cell morphogenesis involves a 15-fold surface expansion, which is accompanied by a strong increase in the amounts of proteins determining the apical membrane and forming the adherens junctions. Interestingly, also, posterior cells expand their surface, albeit in less dramatic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolahi et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells are unable to increase their surface area, but they nevertheless produce the same amount of apical and apicolateral proteins, which then concentrate within a restricted area. We therefore propose that the accumulation of Arm, DE-cadherin, and apical proteins in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells is not caused by impaired endocytosis but a result of the inability of these cells to increase their surface area. Consistent with this, we found that cells whose stretching is prevented by Fas2 overexpression (and which are wild type for <italic>Tao</italic> function) also concentrate Arm within their restricted apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p><p>A membrane domain&#x02013;specific endocytosis function for <italic>Tao</italic> is also supported by experiments, which deplete <italic>Fas2</italic> in <italic>Tao</italic> mutant cells. If <italic>Tao</italic> would act all along the plasma membrane, Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane should selectively rescue the lateral defect (i.e., Fas2 accumulation) but should not suppress the accumulation of apical and apicolateral proteins (e.g., Arm). However, <italic>Fas2 Tao</italic> double mutant cells do suppress Arm accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>). Thus, the primary defect of <italic>Tao</italic> mutants is Fas2 accumulation, which prevents stretching and expansion of the apical surface. The concentration of Arm is only a secondary effect of the cell shape defect. In conclusion, our data favor a model in which Tao promotes endocytosis specifically at the lateral membrane to relieve Fas2-mediated cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of <italic>Tao</italic> in squamous cell morphogenesis</title><p>The identification of a mechanism initiating epithelial morphogenesis in the follicular epithelium allows us to update the current model of squamous cell morphogenesis in the follicular epithelium. Before morphogenesis, all epithelial cells are cuboidal and adhere apicolaterally via DE-cadherin and more basolaterally via Fas2 interactions. In this period, Fas2 is endocytosed and recycled back to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, stage 6). Morphogenesis is primed by the Tao kinase, which promotes the endocytosis of Fas2 vesicles. We assume that a large proportion of the Fas2 vesicles enter the lysosomal pathway, leading to Fas2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, stage 8). The removal of Fas2 from the lateral membrane is a critical first step, which allows morphogenesis to occur. Once Fas2 has disappeared, the cuboidal shape of the epithelial cells is solely stabilized by the zonula adherens. Cell flattening requires a tensile force, and morphometric analysis indicates that this force originates from the continuously growing germline cyst, which stretches cells in the anterior epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, stage 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolahi et al., 2009</xref>). Flattening correlates well with the local breakdown of the zonula adherens, suggesting an important role for adherens junctions remodeling in cell stretching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grammont, 2007</xref>). Although the exact molecular mechanism controlling remodeling has still to be elucidated, our data indicate that before cell stretching, lateral cell adhesion has to be reduced to provide morphogenetic plasticity to the lateral membrane.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for squamous cell morphogenesis.</bold> See last chapter of the Discussion for explanation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201207150_Fig6"/></fig><p>Given the critical role of <italic>Fas2</italic> down-regulation for epithelial stretching, it is counterintuitive that <italic>Fas2</italic> mutant cells undergo normal morphogenesis. However, a similar scenario has been shown for the morphogenesis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here, Fas2 has to be endocytosed in axons to allow glia cell migration. Despite this important function for Fas2 down-regulation, <italic>Fas2</italic> mutants show no gross morphological defects in the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silies and Kl&#x000e4;mbt, 2010</xref>). Thus, although Fas2 down-regulation is critical for epithelial and PNS morphogenesis, both tissues can compensate for the complete loss of the protein. We propose that Fas2 helps to stabilize a morphological state and allows development to proceed only after its timely controlled endocytosis. This mechanism guarantees the correct timing of morphogenesis and thereby helps to coordinate the development of different cell types and tissues. In the follicular epithelium, Fas2 might collaborate with the zonula adherens in counteracting the pressure from the growing germline cyst. As a result, the cuboidal cell shape is stabilized and premature, and uncontrolled stretching is prevented. Subsequently, Fas2 internalization overcomes this control mechanism, and epithelial morphogenesis proceeds.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of Tao mutants</title><p>To generate EMS-induced <italic>Tao</italic> mutants, we made use of an EP element that is inserted into the first, untranslated exon of the Tao locus (EP1455). This transposon neither affects viability nor fertility of the mutant flies. EP elements integrate UAS sequences into the genome, allowing the overexpression of adjacent genes by a Gal4 driver line. Induction of <italic>Tao</italic> expression by combining EP1455 with the ubiquitous driver Tubulin-Gal4 results in lethality. We used this lethal combination of chromosomes to screen for suppressor mutations. To this end, we fed males harboring the EP element with EMS and crossed them to females expressing the Tubulin-Gal4 driver. After screening of more than 10,000 crosses, we obtained 13 suppressors of lethality, which are good candidates to carry mutations in the <italic>Tao</italic> locus. Among those, one suppressor mutation was lethal by itself, which we named <italic>Tao<sup>eta</sup></italic>.
