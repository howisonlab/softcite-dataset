coarctation of the aorta. The diagnosis of Turner syndrome was made in early infancy
(karyotype analysis 45, X). Growth hormone treatment was started at 3 yr and 2 mo of age.
From the age of 4 yr and 5 mo, the patient suffered from persistent diarrhea with traces
of blood and intermittent abdominal discomfort. As these symptoms gradually deteriorated,
she was referred to our clinic at the age of 7 yr for further evaluation. Barium enema
showed aphtha and loss of the fine network pattern in the descending colon and rectum. An
endoscopic examination showed ulceration, edema, friability, and erythema beginning in the
rectum and extending up to the splenic flexure of the descending colon. The histology of
the descending colon area showed severe stromal infiltration of inflammatory cells. These
endoscopic findings and the histological findings were consistent with UC. Thus, based on
these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having UC. Mesalazine therapy was initiated
at this time. The patient is currently being treated with mesalazine (1,000 mg/day) and
abdominal symptoms and bloody diarrhea have disappeared. GH therapy was not interrupted
during the therapy for UC. Retrospectively, growth hormone improved growth velocity (9
cm/year) during the first year of treatment, however from the age of 4 yr, growth velocity
decreased (4&#x02013;5 cm/yr) in spite of the GH treatment. Conclusion: Patients with Turner
syndrome and gastrointestinal symptoms should be investigated for inflammatory bowel
diseases. Growth velocity is useful for evaluating the presence of inflammatory bowel
diseases and other systemic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Turner syndrome</kwd><kwd>ulcerative colitis</kwd><kwd>growth velocity</kwd><kwd>GH therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The clinical picture of Turner syndrome (TS) is characterized by phenotypic features, short
stature and gonadal dysgenesis. In addition, horseshoe kidneys and coarctation of the aorta
are sometimes observed. Less frequently, TS is associated with a variety of other diseases,
such as insulin resistance or Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An increased frequency of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), i.e. Crohn&#x02019;s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), has
been reported in patients with TS (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Impaired growth in children is often linked to
IBDs (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The present article describes a Turner patient who developed UC during growth
hormone therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Case Report</title><p>A 7-yr-old Japanese girl was referred to us for evaluation of bloody diarrhea. TS was
diagnosed in early infancy on the basis of short neck and lymphedema, and was confirmed by
karyotype analysis, i.e. 45, X. Growth hormone (GH) treatment started at 3 yr and 2 mo of
age.</p><p>On admission to our hospital, the patient&#x02019;s height was 106 cm (&#x02013;2.2 SD for normal Japanese
girl) and she weighed 18.6 kg (&#x02013;1.0 SD for normal Japanese girl, obesity +7.5%). She had a
low hairline and deformity of the auricules. Notably absent were shield chest, cubitus
valgus, or pigmented skin lesions. Her temperature was 36.7&#x000b0;C, her heart rate was 88/min and
her respiratory rate was 24/min. Blood pressure was 100/74 mmHg in the upper extremities,
but 76/44 mmHg in the lower extremities. Grade 1/6 harsh systolic ejection murmur was
audible at the 3rd to 4th left sternal border. By cardiac catheterization and an aortogram,
coarctation of the aorta was diagnosed. At 4 yr and 5 mo of age, the patient began suffering
from intermittent abdominal discomfort and developed persistent diarrhea containing traces
of blood. Ova, parasites and bacteriologic culture were negative in stool samples. The
patient lost appetite and had moderate tenderness in her lower abdomen. The abdominal pain
gradually worsened in the following 5 mo and frequency of bloody diarrhea increased (4&#x02013;5
times/d). Pertinent laboratory findings were: serum potassium, 4.2 mEq/l; sodium, 141 mEq/l;
chloride, 108 mEq/l; RBC, 345 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> /&#x003bc;l; Hb, 7.3 g/dl; Ht, 26%; WBC, 4,400 /&#x003bc;l;
serum Fe, 144 &#x003bc;g/dl; UIBC, 322 &#x003bc;g/dl; ferritin, 4.1 ng/ml; cholesterol, 130 mg/dl; total
protein, 6.4 g/dl; albumin, 3.6 g/dl; AST, 19 U/l; ALT, 11 U/l; ALP, 428 U/l;
cholinesterase, 109 U/L; and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h. Thyroid antibody
tests were negative.</p><p>Barium enema showed aphtha and loss of the fine network pattern in the descending colon and
rectum. Endoscopic examination showed ulceration, edema, friability, and erythema beginning
in the rectum and extending up to the splenic flexure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Endoscopic findings of the colon. A: Mucosa findings show granularity and loss of
the normal vascular pattern. B: Methylene Blue dye spraying shows superficial erosions
and spontaneous friability.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cpe-15-097-g001"/></fig>). Histological findings of the sigmoid colon included severe stromal infiltration of
inflammatory cells, depletion of glands and crypt abscess. The mucosa showed severe
ulceration, severe infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, lymphocytes, a moderate number
of polymorphs, and plasma cells.</p><p>From these findings a diagnosis of UC was made, and mesalazine (1,000 mg/d) was started.
Abdominal symptoms and bloody diarrhea have improved with this treatment. GH therapy was
continued without interruption.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Growth Curve and Velocity</title><p>The patient&#x02019;s growth in height has followed the &#x02013;2.0 SD line of normal Japanese girls. In
the growth chart of Japanese TS, her growth has followed the +1.0 SD line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Growth curve.

Japanese girls.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cpe-15-097-g002"/></fig>). Initiation of GH therapy at 3 yr of age initially improved her growth velocity (9
cm/yr for the first year) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p> Growth velocity. The thick line shows the patient&#x02019;s growth velocity on the growth

retrospect, the patient&#x02019;s serum IGF-1 levels during the age of 4&#x02013;7 yr were not elevated (160
to 280 ng/ml) in spite of the GH dose (0.33 mg/kg/wk). After starting mesalazine, however,
her growth velocity increased to 4&#x02013;5 cm/yr again.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prevalence of IBDs in the general population is estimated at 150&#x02013;250 per 100,000
population (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In women with TS, Gravholt et al. calculated a 2-fold increase in the risk
of developing IBD (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Other studies have reported that the risk of this association is much
higher (2.6&#x02013;3%) (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Especially, gastrointestinal symptoms in TS patients are observed at a
younger age, the median age of onset being 16 yr (range 9&#x02013;40 yr) (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). To our knowledge, our
present case report is of the youngest TS patient with UC. Thus, we must keep in mind that
UC or Crohn&#x02019;s disease might be a complication even in young TS patients.</p><p>X chromosomal abnormality may cause abnormal immune functions and increase the
susceptibility to IBDs (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, we should be alert to the fact that UC or Crohn&#x02019;s
disease might be a complication in patients with TS developing unexplained diarrhea or
gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>Patients with IBDs manifest growth failure, which may precede abdominal symptoms by some
years. Our patient showed markedly retarded growth velocity after the onset of bloody
diarrhea in spite of GH therapy. After starting mesalazine for the treatment of UC, the
gastrointestinal symptoms have been well controlled and a catch-up in height velocity has
been observed. Therefore, the impaired response during GH therapy in our patient might have
been caused by the inflammation and malnutrition due to UC overwhelming the anabolic effect
of GH. Awareness of this association has clinical importance in identifying the cause of
growth failure in a child with either X chromosomal abnormality or IBDs (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we emphasize that TS patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should be
investigated for the possible occurrence of IBDs. We must pay attention to growth velocity
during GH treatment in TS patients, because an impaired response to GH may indicate an
association with other systemic disorders including IBDs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>A part of this study was supported by the Mami Mizutani foundation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Caprio</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>, <person-group><name><surname>Boulware</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>, <person-group><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>, <person-group><name><surname>Sherwin</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group>, <person-group><name><surname>Carpenter</surname><given-names>TO</given-names></name></person-group>, <person-group><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>, <etal>et al</etal>
