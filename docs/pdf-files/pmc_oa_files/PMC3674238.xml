Although simple positive feedback is sufficient to drive symmetry breaking, it is highly sensitive to stochastic fluctuations typical for living cells. Here, by integrating mathematical modelling with quantitative experimental validations, we show that in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> a combination of actin- and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-dependent recycling of the central polarity regulator Cdc42 is needed to establish robust cell polarity at a single site during yeast budding. The guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor pathway consistently generates a single-polarization site, but requires Cdc42 to cycle rapidly between its active and inactive form, and is therefore sensitive to perturbations of the GTPase cycle. Conversely, actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 induces robust symmetry breaking but cannot restrict polarization to a single site. Our results demonstrate how cells optimize symmetry breaking through coupling between multiple feedback loops.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Cdc42 binds to various effectors that control essential morphogenetic processes, such as polarized membrane transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, assembly of a septin ring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. To fulfill its functions, Cdc42 must constantly cycle between GTP-bound/active and GDP-bound/inactive states. In budding yeast activation of Cdc42 is controlled by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Cdc24 and Cdc42 hydrolytic activity is promoted by four GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Bem2, Bem3, Rga1 and Rga2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In addition, Cdc42 is extracted from membranes by a single Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), Rdi1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Concentration of Cdc42 at the polarization site in yeast cells can occur via feedback amplification of stochastic fluctuations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and either requires focused, actin-mediated transport of vesicle-bound Cdc42 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) or Bem1-mediated recruitment of soluble Cdc42 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Both pathways drive polarization through constant recycling of Cdc42 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Polarized transport of Cdc42-bearing vesicles has been shown to underlie spontaneous polarization of constitutively active and membrane-restricted Cdc42 via a simple positive feedback mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, polarization of wild-type Cdc42 depends on actin-based secretion, particularly in the absence of Bem1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) or Rdi1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). However, although a role for membrane transport in polarity establishment has been widely established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, its relevance for polarization of wild-type yeast cells is still controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

The available experimental evidence has been combined in a Turing-type model of yeast polarization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

Moreover, the precise relationship between actin- and GDI-dependent mechanisms during establishment of polarization in wild-type cells is unclear.</p><p>Here, we built a stochastic model for yeast polarity establishment through actin- and GDI-mediated recycling of Cdc42. We established assumptions and parameter values for this model through genetic analyses, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution and live cell imaging. Predictions from the model were tested and validated experimentally. We demonstrate that the establishment of a stable and unique polarization axis requires coordination of two pathways. Actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is very robust, but does not reliably result in formation of a single-polarization site. In contrast, GDI-dependent recycling is sensitive to changes in the GTPase cycle of Cdc42 but faithfully generates a unique polarization site. Our results suggest that correct polarity establishment is achieved through coupling of multiple feedback loops.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Validation of strains</title><p>To build a mechanistic model for yeast polarity establishment we sought to firmly establish the connections between all involved regulators and pathways.

Tagging also did not affect growth and polarization kinetics, either in the presence or absence of actin-dependent transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c&#x02013;f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Parallel Cdc42 recycling pathways in polarity establishment</title><p>Overexpressed Cdc42 might be buffered by its GDI, which is generally found in a 1:1 complex with its substrates in the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Actin and Rdi1 have been proposed to act in parallel during polarity maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. To systematically investigate the connection between Rdi1- and actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42, we analysed genetic interactions of Cdc42 and its regulators with synthetic genetic arrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Genetic lesions in all examined components had a negative impact on processes linked to actin functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In contrast, few physical interactions of Cdc42 regulators with actin-associated proteins have been reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that, in addition to the role of Cdc42 in formation and polarization of actin structures, Cdc42 signalling and actin-mediated transport processes also act in parallel during essential cellular processes.</p><p>Rdi1 exhibited interactions with several components involved in endocytic recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), consistent with a role in actin-independent recycling of Cdc42 during polarity establishment. To test this, we studied synchronized yeast cells expressing GFP&#x02013;Cdc42 fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b&#x02013;d</xref>), and monitored Cdc42 cap formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. As expected from a defect in extraction of membrane-bound Cdc42, &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells accumulated Cdc42 on membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Nevertheless, polarization kinetics were unaffected in &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells and in cells expressing Cdc42<sup>R66E</sup>, a mutant unable to interact with the GDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, depolymerization of actin with latrunculin B (LatB), which has moderate effects on control cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), blocked polarization in &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> and Cdc42<sup>R66E</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). A similar synergistic effect was observed when exocytosis was blocked using a temperature-sensitive allele of MYO2 (<italic>myo2&#x02013;16</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Reduction of endocytosis by deletion of the ESCRTIII component VPS27 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) resulted in less efficient polarization of &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Colocalization of GFP-Cdc42 and FM4-64-stained endocytic membranes in &#x00394;vps27 cells revealed Cdc42 accumulation in aberrant endocytic compartments, confirming passage of Cdc42 through the endocytic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p>Our results confirm that Rdi1- and actin-based cycling of Cdc42 contribute to polarity establishment via distinct and parallel mechanisms. We therefore proceeded to design a particle-based mathematical model of Cdc42 polarization to study the interplay between the two pathways.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A stochastic model for polarity establishment</title><p>To build an experimentally tractable model, we considered the two recycling pathways for Cdc42 separately. Recent studies have stressed the importance of considering individual vesicle carriers instead of simple protein flux<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, many mechanistic details of actin-based membrane recycling are unknown, rendering detailed models highly speculative. Importantly, the proposed dilution effect of vesicle delivery on the Cdc42 cap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> is not supported by our experiments, as Cdc42 cap intensities are significantly higher in control cells compared with cells, in which actin-mediated transport processes are disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). A recent study has also shown the feasibility of polarity establishment if Cdc42 exhibits non-uniform diffusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We therefore opted to simulate actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 using a coarse-grained approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S8, 9</xref>). We assumed that membrane-bound Cdc42 molecules are delivered to the plasma membrane from internal membranes along actin cables. Sites of enhanced cable nucleation are generated at a rate that depends on the amount of active Cdc42 at the respective nucleation site. Endocytosis was modelled with a constant extraction rate.</p><p>For Rdi1-mediated recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) we assumed a well-mixed pool of Cdc42 in the cytosol and diffusion of Cdc42 in the plasma membrane with <italic>D</italic>=0.036&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Nucleotide exchange can occur spontaneously or catalysed by the GEF Cdc24 via a bounded positive feedback loop involving the Cdc42 effector Bem1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Such bounded feedback is essential to achieve realistic cap shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) and corresponds to depletion of limiting components involved in Cdc42 recruitment. GTP hydrolysis is modelled with a constant rate depending on GAP activity.</p><p>It has been shown that GDIs preferentially extract GDP-bound Rho GTPases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To firmly establish this important aspect in our model, we performed <italic>in-vitro</italic> extraction experiments with purified Cdc42 and RhoGDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We found that the GDI indeed extracted GDP-bound Cdc42 around 10 times faster than GTP-Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In the presence of catalytic amounts of GAP domain, GTP-Cdc42 was extracted at nearly the same rate as GDP-Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating that GTP hydrolysis is rate-limiting for GDI-mediated Cdc42 extraction. This was supported by the extremely slow extraction of Cdc42 bound to non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (GMPPNP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In living yeast cells, we confirmed previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> that constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42<sup>G12V</sup>) is restricted to membranes and the slow actin-mediated recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Hence, we incorporated selective extraction of GDP-Cdc42 by the GDI into our model.</p><p>Recruitment from the Rdi1-GDP-Cdc42 pool to the membrane was assumed to occur at a background rate and via a second positive feedback loop that enhances attachment of cytosolic Cdc42 to sites of high Cdc42 activity. This feedback represents the previously proposed competition between Rab and Rho GEFs and the respective GDIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. To observe whether such competition indeed occurs for Rho GTPases, we investigated the effect of GEF activity on the interaction between GDI and mammalian Rac1, which is similar in mechanism and kinetics to GDI&#x02013;Cdc42 interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Exposure to the GEF domain of Dock180 (DHR2C) and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue was sufficient to dissociate soluble GDI&#x02013;Rac1 complexes, allowing free GMPPNP-bound Rac1 to bind to liposomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Conversely, nucleotide exchange by the GEF was strongly reduced in the presence of GDI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>), consistent with competition for binding to the switch II region of the GTPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. These results cannot be directly transferred to living yeast cells. However, we found that the dominant-negative mutant Cdc42<sup>D57Y</sup>, which sequesters its GEF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, could no longer be extracted by the GDI and was instead slowly recycled via actin-mediated transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Our results are consistent with competition between GEF and GDI for binding of Cdc42-GDP. We therefore implemented interference of GEF activity with Cdc42&#x02013;GDI interaction by increasing the rate of Cdc42 membrane association in regions of high Cdc42 activity (equivalent to high GEF concentrations).</p><p>GDI-mediated polarization is of considerable theoretical interest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our results indicate that GDI-mediated recycling of Cdc42 depends on the latter&#x02019;s catalytic cycle, and both GAP and GEF need to be regulated to allow rapid shuttling between membrane and cytosol. In a previous model, positive feedback in Cdc42 activation was based on non-linear recruitment of Cdc24 to Cdc42-GTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The model predicts slower turnover of Cdc24 if Cdc42 activity is increased. However, we found that the level of GEF expression or actin or Cdc42 activity had no influence on Cdc24 turnover at the polarized site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>), indicating that feedback must be implemented in a different manner. Our model assumes linear recruitment of the GEF to Cdc42-GTP, but instead incorporates two GEF-mediated, and experimentally supported, positive feedback loops for activation and physical recruitment of Cdc42 (dashed boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), respectively. A short comparison of features and limitations in various models for yeast cell polarity is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>. A detailed review on this subject has also been published recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Determination of quantitative model parameters</title><p>Having established a general structure for the two Cdc42 recycling pathways we set out to determine realistic values for the parameters involved in their operation.

This slower recovery was proposed to result from greater accumulation of Cdc42 in caps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, Cdc42 cap intensities in LatB-treated cells were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), supporting a positive role for actin in Cdc42 polarization. Perturbation of Cdc42&#x02013;Rdi1 interactions by deletion of <italic>RDI1</italic> or the use of the Cdc42<sup>R66E</sup> mutant drastically slowed recovery to a <italic>T</italic>/2 of 10&#x02009;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), confirming previous work on polarity maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

Next, we searched for model predictions that we could validate experimentally. One critical aspect of the model is the fact that GDI-mediated extraction is restricted to GDP-Cdc42, predicting loss of polarization in LatB-treated cells at very low rates of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The hydrolysis rate in control cells, estimated by fitting values for cap height/width and FRAP times, was 2.74&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (grey dashed line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To check the model-based prediction we reduced GTP hydrolysis on Cdc42 by deleting <italic>BEM2</italic>, the GAP with the largest number of genetic interactions with actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cdc42 in &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells was able to polarize efficiently, albeit with slightly reduced speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). However, when actin was disrupted most &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells could no longer polarize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Similar results were obtained when monitoring Cdc24 or Bem1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3d</xref>). In our simulations polarization occurred over a wide range of hydrolysis values, with the control rate being close to the maximum permissible before polarization breaks down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To study the impact of changes in hydrolysis rates on a more quantifiable parameter, we tested the effect of deleting <italic>BEM2</italic> on Cdc42 mobility. The model predicted a gradual increase in <italic>T</italic>/2 upon reduction of the GTP hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). This slowdown was expected to be more pronounced in LatB-treated cells. In agreement with this prediction, in &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells and the slow-acting mutant Cdc42<sup>G60A</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), FRAP halftimes increased to 6.7 and 6.8&#x02009;s, respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In our model this recovery rate corresponds to a roughly 16-fold decrease in the rate of GTP hydrolysis to (grey dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). At this hydrolysis rate, Cdc42 in LatB-treated cells is predicted to recycle with a <italic>T</italic>/2 of 8.7&#x02009;s&#x02014;a value close to the measured 9.6&#x02009;s for LatB-treated &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Hence, our results indicate that the contribution of actin to Cdc42 recycling is increased in &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic>, likely due to reduced extraction of active Cdc42 by its GDI.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The mechanism of formation of multiple polarization sites</title><p>In all our simulations, the GDI pathway alone was never able to generate multiple stable polarization site. However, yeast cells are capable of simultaneously polarizing at two or more sites, for example, after deletion of <italic>BEM2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), deletion or overexpression of <italic>BEM1</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) or overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that 2.3&#x000b1;0.5% (<italic>n</italic>=4 &#x000d7; 100 cells) of &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells formed two stable polarization sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), a value that could be reproduced in our model after fitting the actin-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, grey dashed line at a=2.74&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Varying parameters in the model generated two testable predictions. First, increased Cdc42 activation should strongly increase the percentage of &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells that form multiple polarization sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>, blue curve). Second, even cells with a functional GDI should form multiple caps if rates of GTP hydrolysis are reduced sufficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>, black curve). Rdi1-mediated recycling of Cdc42 alone was unable to generate multiple stable caps in our simulations. The formation of multiple caps at lower hydrolysis rates can be explained by the reduction or loss of the ability of GDI-mediated recycling to restrict cap formation to a single-polarization site and the enhanced nucleation of actin at higher levels of Cdc42-GTP. To increase Cdc42 activity in &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells, we exploited the known cell cycle-dependent activation of Cdc42 after the G1/S transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. We released &#x00394;<italic>rdi1</italic> cells from G1 arrest in the presence of LatB to prevent immediate polarization and washed the drug out at different times to allow polarization with varying initial Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>). As predicted, the number of cells with two polarization sites increased from 2.3&#x02013;13% and 23% with increasing duration of drug treatment and hence increasing level of Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Next, we used &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells to increase Cdc42 activity in the presence of Rdi1. We found that similar to a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, 8.7% of cells formed two buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>), and this was independent of the GFP tag, strain background or Cdc42 expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). We further increased Cdc42 activity by overexpressing Cdc24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5d</xref>) or expressing a Cdc42 mutant with high intrinsic GDP release rate (Cdc42<sup>F28L</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>)). Neither treatment induced formation of double buds in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary S5c</xref>). However, in &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> strains the number of cells forming multiple polarization sites increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary S5c</xref>). Our results indicate that actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is prone to creating multiple polarization sites, and that this effect is sensitive to the level of Cdc42 activity. Moreover, our results show that perturbation of GDI-mediated polarization can induce formation of multiple buds in otherwise wild-type cells.</p><p>Although formation of two polarization sites in a small percentage of cells in a population might, at first sight, seem tolerable, even slight effects on cell division could translate into a strong evolutionary disadvantage. Indeed, we found that the formation of multiple buds directly correlated with an increased number of mis-segregated nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>) and this effect was dependent on increased activity of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). On average, more than 20% of cells with double buds also exhibited defects in nuclear segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figs 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7e</xref>). Formation of multiple buds therefore likely has direct impact on cell survival.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that yeast cells can establish polarity by localizing the central polarity regulator Cdc42 through a combination of two recycling pathways with distinct mechanistic features. GDI-dependent recycling of Cdc42 is fast and coupled to the GTPase cycle of Cdc42. Symmetry breaking in this pathway occurs via a combination of positive feedback loops for activation and recruitment of Cdc42, is characterized by efficient formation of a unique polarization axis, but is sensitive to perturbations in the GTPase cycle of Cdc42. In contrast, actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is slower and depends solely on Cdc42 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The use of actin cables for delivery of Cdc42 to the plasma membrane leads to formation of very stable polarization sites. However, this stability comes with a significant risk of stochastically generating multiple stable polarization sites&#x02014;an effect that becomes especially prominent if Cdc42 activity is increased. By combining the two recycling pathways, yeast cells ensure reliable establishment of a unique polarity axis.</p><p>To quantitatively analyse the interplay between Cdc42 recycling pathways, we built a particle-based mechanistic model for polarity establishment and performed extensive stochastic simulations. We kept the model complexity at a level that was appropriately supported by experimental evidence. We used measurements from a variety of quantitative <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to validate and constrain assumptions and parameters. This integrated approach allowed us to make detailed predictions concerning polarization efficiency, protein localization kinetics and number of polarization sites, which were confirmed with remarkable accuracy by our experimental data.</p><p>Two key features in our model should be emphasized. First, we found that polarity establishment in yeast did not sensitively depend on the quantity of Cdc42 in the cell. This was also observed in our simulations, where a 10-fold increase in Cdc42 concentration failed to prevent polarization (N(Cdc42)=3,000&#x02013;30,000 yield 100% polarization). These findings contradict a recent study, in which stochastic polarization of Cdc42 was proposed to depend critically on low expression levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Instead, we find that polarization depends on the level of Cdc42 activity. Second, because of separate positive feedback in Cdc42 activation (Cdc42<sup>GTP</sup>&#x02013;GEF&#x02013;Bem1&#x02013;Cla4 interactions) and Cdc42 recruitment (GEF&#x02013;GDI competition), our model does not depend on non-linear recruitment of the GEF, which was required for polarization in a previous model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and was not supported by our experiments.</p><p>Our results indicate that yeast cells did not simply evolve two redundant polarization pathways to safeguard an essential process against random error. Instead they combine positive features of both pathways to simultaneously achieve reliability and spatial precision in cell polarization. Such an optimized interplay of pathways requires precise selection of parameter values. Indeed, our results suggest that the GTPase cycle of Cdc42 has a central role in coordinating pathways underlying polarity establishment. In particular, the Cdc42 hydrolysis rate is restricted to a rather narrow range between roughly 1 and 3&#x02009;s. Faster rates lead to a loss of polarization due to insufficient amounts of active Cdc42 in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), although slower hydrolysis leads to formation of multiple buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The latter effect is a result of a reduced recycling speed and hence smaller contribution for the GDI pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and a simultaneous failure of the actin pathway to focus polarization to a single site if Cdc42 activity is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). GDI recycling therefore needs to be faster than the actin pathway to ensure polarization at a single site and in our simulations Cdc42 in control cells seems to indeed hydrolyse GTP with nearly maximal possible speed. At the other extreme, if the GDI pathway is deleted, cells become very prone to form multiple caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide a mechanistic link between the fast GTPase cycle and GDI-mediated membrane recycling of Rho GTPases. Similar interactions have also been reported for small GTPases of the Rab family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The mechanisms we identified for localization of Cdc42 might therefore also be applicable for other processes of spatial cellular organization.</p><p>Our proposed model was capable of reproducing all our experimental results and made several accurate and quantitative predictions. However, there are still many open questions concerning the biophysical and biochemical basis for cell polarization. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that lipid composition at the polarized site, in particular negatively charged phospholipids, influence the association of Cdc42 with the plasma membrane and hence impact on cell polarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Furthermore, although we assumed cell cycle-dependent activation of Cdc24 and inactivation of Bem2 in the LatB washout experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>), the detailed biochemistry of these regulatory processes is not fully understood and they were not included in the mathematical model. Finally, we did not consider potential regulation of GDI&#x02013;Cdc42 interaction or GDI-membrane interaction by phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. All these additional aspects provide ample scope for future improvements in both modelling and mechanistic understanding of cell polarization. As nicely summarized in a recent review, the value of a mathematical model should be judged &#x02018;not by how complex and detailed it is, but by what could be learned from it&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Our current model consequently incorporates the minimum degree of complexity compatible with generation of meaningful forecasts, and was able to reflect and predict basic properties of cellular organization that will hopefully help to rationalize a variety of different biological processes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture and plasmids</title><p>All strains are derived from RWS116, in which only one G1 cyclin, CLN2, is expressed under the control of a methionine repressible promoter.

Cells expressing GFPCdc42, GFPCdc42 and Cdc24RFP or GFPCdc42<sup>F28L</sup> (a mutant with fast intrinsic GDP exchange) were treated with LatB as in (<bold>d</bold>). Examples of double cap formation in &#x00394;<italic>bem2</italic> cells expressing either GFPCdc42 or GFPCdc42<sup>F28L</sup> are shown on the right. Bars represent means&#x000b1;s.e.m. for three experiments with 100 cells each. Schematics illustrate changes in the Cdc42 GTPase cycle.
