The &#x02018;Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI <italic>z</italic>-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>SUBJECTS/METHODS:</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91&#x00025;) at 12 months and 985 (86&#x00025;) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference=&#x02013;0.90&#x02009;kg (95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI)=&#x02013;1.50, &#x02212;0.30), <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and BMI (&#x02212;0.28&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (&#x02212;0.50, &#x02212;0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (&#x02212;0.05 (&#x02212;0.11; 0.01), <italic>P</italic>=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (&#x02212;0.62&#x02009;kg (&#x02212;1.21, 0.03), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and BMI (&#x02212;0.28&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (&#x02212;0.49, &#x02212;0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (&#x02212;0.08 (&#x02212;0.14; &#x02212;0.02), <italic>P</italic>=0.02) favouring the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist in preventing unhealthy weight gain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Preventing obesity during adolescence is a public health priority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Internationally, among adolescent populations (10&#x02013;19 years), the prevalence of overweight and obesity is estimated to be between 20&#x02013;30&#x00025;,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> During puberty, adolescents experience changes in body composition and physical fitness, and decreased insulin sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Changes in eating behaviours, physical activity, sedentary behaviours and psychological wellbeing may also occur during this critical period of growth and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> These behavioural and physiological changes increase the risk of overweight and obesity during adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Global self-reported data from 105 countries estimate that just 20&#x00025; of adolescents participate in &#x02a7e;60&#x02009;min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Longitudinal studies have also shown a decline in physical activity during adolescence of ~7&#x00025; of MVPA per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Research across 32 countries in Europe, Israel and North America indicates a positive association between physical inactivity and socio-economic disadvantage in adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>The school environment is a recommended setting for the promotion of physical activity among adolescents;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> however, school-based physical activity interventions have resulted in only a small increase in objectively measured MVPA (~4&#x02009;min per day) of children, and limited reductions in the adiposity of adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> A systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies (including 18&#x02009;141 students) that aimed to determine the effect of school-based physical activity interventions (&#x0003e;6 months duration) on body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents found that neither BMI (mean difference= &#x02212;0.05&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, 95&#x00025; CI (confidence interval):&#x02212;0.19; 0.10) nor any other body composition measures improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The review primarily included elementary-aged students in Grades 3&#x02013;6, and 15 of the 18 studies included a nutrition co-intervention.

A three-level hierarchical model was used to capture correlations in the data with random intercepts for repeat measures (level 1), on individuals (level 2) and clustering within schools (level 3). The LMM analyses aimed to determine if there was a significant difference in mean change from baseline to 12 months and baseline to 24 months between intervention and control groups for each outcome measure, both assessed using an interaction term between treatment group (intervention vs. control) and time (baseline vs. 12 months and baseline vs. 24 months). Two sensitivity analyses were conducted, first using only those that provided complete adiposity outcomes at all three time points (complete cases), and second using multiple imputation to fill in the missing data. The multiple imputation model used the method of chained regression equations, including variables that were prognostic of missing data and additional demographic and outcome data to create five imputed data sets.

The intervention had a favourable impact on adiposity outcomes, having a moderate effect on weight and BMI at 12 months, and weight, BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score at 24 months. A difference in BMI of &#x02212;0.28&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> over 24 months between intervention and control groups is twice the effect found in a meta-analysis of 11 school-based physical activity intervention studies (&#x02212;0.13&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> However, of the 11 physical activity interventions, only 2 were conducted in secondary schools and only 1 of these during school time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In the latter study, the effectiveness of a 12-week school exercise training programme was tested in 24 obese, adolescent males, and found a significant intervention effect of &#x02212;0.59&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (95&#x00025; CI =&#x02212;1.4; 0.23).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> The small sample in a high-risk, single-sex obese subgroup and the short intervention duration makes it difficult to equate to PA4E1. In an earlier meta-analysis of 18 studies, the intervention effect on BMI was much lower at &#x02212;0.05&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (&#x02212;0.19; 0.10).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> However, only two of the 18 studies exclusively investigated the effect of a physical activity intervention in middle- or secondary-school students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup></p><p>The exploratory subgroup analyses found a significant effect at 24 months, favouring the intervention group on (i) weight among male adolescents, and (ii) weight, BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score among underweight/healthy weight adolescents. There were no treatment effects on any of the adiposity measures for the other subgroups examined including females, overweight/obese students or active/inactive students. Although the moderator analyses indicate that the PA4E1 intervention was effective in limiting weight and BMI increases in the underweight/healthy weight subgroup, there was no evidence that the intervention had an adverse effect on underweight students as the proportion of underweight students decreased during the study, from 7.3&#x00025; at baseline to 2.5&#x00025; at 24 months. Weight, BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score increased in both intervention and control underweight/healthy weight students, but increased to a lesser extent among students in the intervention group.</p><p>In PA4E1, 76&#x00025; of students were not overweight or obese at baseline meaning a lower propensity to reduce adiposity measures. For this reason the authors of the HEALTHY study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> have suggested that although population-based primary prevention interventions should continue to target all children, the study aim and primary outcomes should be evaluated in the highest-risk subgroup (overweight/obese adolescents) instead of the entire cohort. Although there were no significant intervention effects in the PA4E1 overweight/obese subgroup, the adiposity results for the intervention group are trending in the hypothesised direction and the effect was larger than that found in the main analysis and among healthy weight/underweight students. A lack of significant findings in overweight and obese students is likely to be a sample size issue, as the disproportionate number of adolescents in each weight status group may have contributed to the sub-analyses being underpowered.</p><p>At 24 months, the mean difference in BMI change between groups was &#x02212;0.28&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, with the intervention group's students increasing BMI by 1.59&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and control by 1.87&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> over 2 years. This BMI trajectory is higher (intervention=~0.80&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per year; control=~0.94&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per year) than that found in a longitudinal study in Britain that aimed to examine the developmental trajectory of obesity throughout adolescence in relation to sex, ethnicity and socio-economic status in a cohort of 5836 adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> Over 5 years from Grade 7 to Grade 11, BMI increased by 0.73&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> The rate of BMI increase did not differ by sex; however, socio-economically disadvantaged and black female adolescents had higher rates of overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> The higher BMI trajectory in participants of the PA4E1 study may also explain why PA4E1 was effective in limiting the adiposity increases in underweight/healthy weight adolescents, but had a limited, non-significant effect on overweight and obese adolescents.</p><p>The majority of school-based physical activity interventions targeting adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities have not reported the effect on adiposity outcomes, and few have found an intervention effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> However, the results of PA4E1 are similar to findings from the &#x02018;Intervention Centred on Adolescent Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour' (ICAPS) study, which found intervention effects on BMI <italic>z</italic>-score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> Similar to PA4E1, ICAPS was a socio-ecologically framed, multi-component intervention, implemented over a longer 4-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> The intervention involved changing attitudes towards physical activity (that is, educational component), promoting social support from teachers and parents (that is, regular meetings), and providing environmental and institutional conditions to promote physical activity (for example, break-time and after-school physical activity, sporting events and cycle to school days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> The impact of ICAPS on adiposity (BMI <italic>z</italic>-score=&#x02212;0.11; <italic>P</italic>=0.02) was comparable to PA4E1 (BMI <italic>z</italic>-score =&#x02212;0.08; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), and were maintained for 2 years 6 months after the intervention had finished, indicating that the results could be sustained. Similar proportions of overweight and obese adolescents were reported in ICAPS (23&#x00025;) and PA4E1 (22&#x00025;), and neither of the studies found significant adiposity effects on adolescents who were initially overweight or obese. The findings provide evidence for long-term multi-component interventions that target determinants at all socio-ecological levels (that is, intra-personal, inter-personal, organisation, community and policy).</p><p>PA4E1 is one of few school-based physical activity interventions to reduce the risk of overweight and obesity in adolescents living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> A recent systematic review of childhood-obesity-prevention programmes incorporating diet and physical activity strategies, found that the strength of evidence was high for physical activity-only interventions in schools with home involvement, and for combined diet-physical activity interventions delivered with both home and community components. The PA4E1 findings indicate that school-based physical activity-only interventions (with home and community components) show promise, particularly adolescent populations. The impact of the intervention on adiposity outcomes could also be enhanced by incorporating a dietary school-based component with home and community involvement.</p><p>Although the adiposity results are unlikely to be clinically significant at an individual level, the reduced adiposity trajectory may produce health benefits at a population level and over an individual's lifetime. A 1&#x00025; reduction in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in 16&#x02013;17-year-old adolescents today has been projected to reduce the number of obese adults by 52&#x02009;821 in the future, decrease total lifetime medical costs by $586.3 million dollars and increase the quality-adjusted life years by 47&#x02009;138 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> The positive effect of PA4E1 on adiposity may have occurred due to the increase in objectively measured MVPA of 7 more minutes of MVPA per day than the control students at 24 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> The PA4E1 intervention was a multi-component and socio-ecologically framed school-based intervention, key elements of which have been recommended to increase physical activity and reduce the prevalence of obesity during adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The intervention addressed educational, curricular and environmental changes in the school, supported by evidence from recent systematic reviews of school-based interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> A &#x02018;change agent', who was a trained PE teacher, visited each of the intervention schools 1 day per week for the duration of the intervention to support the school and PE teachers in implementing the strategies (the change agent did not deliver any classes). The use of strategies within a sustainable framework of PA4E1 makes it a potentially scalable intervention. The intervention could be disseminated more broadly in secondary schools by education departments, and therefore, warrants dissemination evaluation.</p><p>This PA4E1 study had several strengths including the RCT design, the long intervention duration and a large sample size. The study included a suite of intervention implementation strategies based on the theoretical frameworks and evidence from past school-based physical activity reviews. Analyses were repeated using complete cases only and multiple imputation which reported similar results to the main analysis with regard to weight, BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score, suggesting that the findings are robust. A number of limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. Although BMI is an acceptable measure of change in adiposity, direct measures, such as dual-energy radiography absorptiometry, give a more accurate measure of adiposity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> Although the study was implemented over a 24-month period, the study did not assess whether the adiposity differences were sustained in the longer term once the &#x02018;change agent' ceased visiting the intervention schools. The students were recruited from moderate-to-large sized, socio-economically disadvantaged schools from one area in Australia, which may reduce the generalisability of the findings. The study did not collect maturation data from students. The study is likely to be underpowered for the subgroup analyses so these findings should be interpreted with caution, as the lack of a treatment effect may have been due to type II error (failing to detect an effect that is present). Assessment of the cost and cost effectiveness of the PA4E1 intervention will be reported in a separate paper.</p><p>There is a need for innovative physical activity interventions to target adolescents most at risk of overweight and obesity. The results from the PA4E1 intervention provide evidence for a multi-component physical activity intervention implemented in secondary schools to have a moderate effect on adiposity outcomes at the population level among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in MVPA may assist in preventing overweight and obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the PA4E1 staff who worked as project officers, research assistants and data collectors on the project.
