More than 1500 mutations in &#x02265;11 causative genes have been identified in HCM, most of which are unique to individual families.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> It is estimated that about 70% of patients who are positive for genetic tests carry mutations in &#x003b2;-myosin heavy chain (<italic>MYH7</italic>) and myosin-binding protein C (<italic>MYBPC3</italic>) genes; these 2 genes account for up to 50% of all clinically diagnosed cases of HCM, whereas other genes account for &#x0003c;10% of cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Clinically, HCM is a highly heterogeneous disease with not only considerable interfamilial, but also intrafamilial variability in disease phenotypes, which include disease severity, age of onset, and disease progression.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The extensive phenotypic variability cannot be fully explained by the causal mutations because even siblings sharing the same pathological mutation still show huge discordant phenotypes. This unexplained variance raises the possibility of contribution from other genetic factors, the so-called modifier genes.</p><p>It is of great importance to identify these genetic modifiers in light of genetic-based diagnosis, risk stratification, and disease treatment. Pharmacologic interventions of the modifier genes involved in HCM-specific pathways might provide new therapeutic opportunities. However, identification of such modifier genes remains challenging and systemic exploration is absent in HCM. Among these few modifiers investigated in HCM, the most studied was genetic variations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (<italic>RAAS</italic>) genes. It was first proposed in a HCM family with a causal <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutation that patients with the pro-left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) genotypes in RAAS genes manifested cardiac hypertrophy, whereas those without pro-LVH genotypes did not.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> However, this observation was not confirmed in a recent study involving a large population of 368 sporadic HCM patients who carried founder mutations in <italic>MYBPC3</italic> gene,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> indicating that there are other currently unknown modifiers to be discovered.</p><p>Family study is important in modifier gene investigation because the population is homogeneous and more readily available than a large sample of unrelated patients, which is always a genetically heterogeneous population. In a Chinese HCM family, we recently identified 8 members harboring a <italic>MYBPC3</italic> disease-causing mutation but with very disparate phenotypes. It is most likely that other functional mutations in relevant genes provide synergistic effects with <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutation and lead to an early-onset and severe phenotype. We aimed to identify these possible genetic variants using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze all known causing genes and closely related genes for cardiomyopathy and channelopathy, given ion cycling deficiency and sarcomeric structure impairment were the major pathological mechanisms of HCM.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local ethics committee at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine.

His electrocardiogram showed prominent LVH. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a severe form of HCM with a marked hypertrophic septum (27&#x0200a;mm) and a left-ventricular outflow obstruction (LVOTO) of 32&#x0200a;mmHg. Exercise echocardiography revealed that LVOTO increased to 60&#x0200a;mmHg. He received metoprolol treatment (190&#x0200a;mg/day), but refused to receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA), or septal myectomy because he remained fully active after drug therapy with only mild functional limitation (functional class New York Heart Association class II). He unfortunately suffered sudden death 1 year later when he was 29 years&#x02019; old. His mother (IV-2) suffered from exertional angina for 10 years and was diagnosed with HCM showing atypical hypertrophy (23&#x0200a;mm). Her symptoms improved on treatment with metoprolol, and her cardiac function remained stable from her recent echocardiography.</p><p>Two uncles of the index patient (IV-4 and IV-5) showed very similar clinical pictures: they both suffered from exertional dyspnea, had permanent atrial fibrillation, and hypertrophic interventricular septum (19&#x0200a;mm). Rest echocardiogram did not show evidence of LVOTO. IV-4 received pharmacological therapy of beta-blockers and low-dose loop diuretics, but unfortunately encountered sudden death at age 52. IV-5 did not receive any treatment and his NYHA functional class remained II to III. IV-6 was diagnosed with HCM at the age 64 as part of clinical screening of the family. Her echocardiogram showed moderate asymmetrical hypertrophy with a maximum wall thickness (MWT) of 15&#x0200a;mm and normal LV dimensions and systolic function. IV-8 was diagnosed with hypertension (grade 2) at age 38 and did not receive any antihypertensive agents for 7 years. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at this screening confirmed uncontrolled hypertension with an average blood pressure of 155/99&#x0200a;mmHg. Auxiliary examinations ruled out secondary hypertension. He is asymptomatic and his echocardiogram showed a symmetric LV hypertrophy and a mildly increased LV chamber dilation and reduced systolic function. It was unlikely the burned-out phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>The clinical characteristics of the family were shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

However, V-8 needs follow-up reevaluation because he was only 18 at his last clinical evaluation. This remarkable phenotypic variation indicates that disease modifiers exist.</p><p>We first genotyped the five variations in <italic>RAAS</italic> genes and revealed no correlation between HCM phenotypes and these genotypes, which ruled out the modifying effect of these RAAS variants. We then performed targeted NGS for the index HCM patient using a panel covering all known causing genes and closely related genes of cardiomyopathy and channelopathy, and the <italic>RAAS</italic> genes. The NGS captured 99.5% of the target region. A mean coverage of 307&#x000d7; was reached and 92.7% of target regions were covered to a depth of at least 20&#x0200a;&#x000d7;. In total, we identified 301 genetic variants in the index patient across the target region. After excluding synonymous genetic variants, 135 exonic or splice-site variants remained. Further excluding common variants (&#x02265;1.0%) reported in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes, and exomes generated in house left us with 5 candidate variants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

HCM is a disease with complex pathogenesis, among which the most well-known were cycling deficiency and sarcomeric structure impairment.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Adrenergic system are also involved in the process of LVH or heart failure,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and reports showed possible modifying effect of variations in their related genes.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In our study, however, we did not found associations between these variations in adrenergic system and HCM phenotypes.</p><p>Accumulating evidences support that HCM patients carrying &#x0003e;1 sarcomere gene mutation were associated with more remarkable phenotypes and more adverse outcomes than those with a single mutation.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, this is not the case in our study because we did not find patients carrying multiple sarcomere mutations. Instead, for the first time, we showed that <italic>CACNB2</italic> is a possible genetic modifier of <italic>MYBPC3</italic>-associated familial HCM. Our findings were supported by a recently published study, in which Lopes et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> used targeted high-throughput sequencing to investigate the genotype&#x02013;phenotype associations in HCM, and demonstrated that in patients harboring sarcomere protein gene mutations, those who also carried Ankyrin-B gene (<italic>ANK2</italic>) variants had greater maximum wall thickness. It is notable that mutations in both <italic>ANK2</italic> and <italic>CACNB2</italic> could lead to channelopathies.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In this regard, it is reasonable to postulate that variants in non-sarcomere genes, particularly in candidate genes for channelopathies, are potential genetic modifiers of <italic>MYBPC3</italic>-related HCM.</p><p>The proposed concept that channelopathy gene mutations may contribute to HCM phenotype was further advanced by a study screening for mutations in 7 Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory genes (i.e., <italic>SRI</italic>, <italic>FKBP1B</italic>, <italic>CASQ2</italic>, <italic>PLN</italic>, <italic>SLN</italic>, <italic>CALR3</italic>, and <italic>CALM</italic>) in a cohort of 252 unrelated familial HCM patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Four variants with pathogenic significance were detected in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory genes, among which 2 patients also carried the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> sarcomere mutations.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The modifying effect of these variants was not fully illustrated because the family pedigrees were small and screening for other relatives was unavailable. In light of our observations and the data reviewed above, it is likely that most of the evidences concerning modifier genes in HCM are obtained on the basis of <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutations. This may be because of the &#x0201c;benign&#x0201d; nature of most <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutations,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> as <italic>MYBPC3</italic> mutations are usually associated with a mild hypertrophy, late-onset, incomplete penetrance, and a better prognosis. Besides, <italic>MYBPC3</italic> gene is the only gene reported in HCM with founder mutations, for example, 2% to 8% of all major Indian populations carry a <italic>MYBPC3</italic> deletion, and 0.4% of Iceland population carries a <italic>MYPPC3</italic> missense mutation.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> It would be of great interest to investigate genetic modifiers in these populations with founder mutations.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.4</label><title>Possible mechanisms of the CACNB2 mutation modifying disease phenotype</title><p><italic>CACNB2</italic> encodes for an auxiliary voltage-dependent L-type calcium-channel (LTCC) Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2 subunit and is predominantly expressed in the heart. The Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2 subunit improves the calcium current by promoting the voltage-dependent opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and enhancing channel surface expression, probably through direct interaction with actin. Mice lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2 have functionally compromised heart and die at embryonic day 10.5.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Diminished L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were observed in these Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, as well as in patients with Brugada syndrome harboring loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CACNB2.</italic><sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Based on algorithmic prediction, it is likely that the <italic>CACNB2</italic> mutation identified in our study could attenuate L-type calcium current in cardiomyocytes, and then inhibits the activation of calcium/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a key regulator of cardiac physiology and pathology.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Subsequently, on the one hand, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C, which is critical in maintaining sarcomeric structure and function, is markedly decreased. Dephosphorylated cMyBP-C is prone to degradation,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> and thus leads to dramatic insufficiency of cMyBP-C. This situation is worsened given that the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> truncation mutation itself causes haploinsufficiency. It is very likely that the serious cMyBP-C deficiency significantly exacerbates the development of HCM in those severely affected patients because a lack of functional full-length cMyBP-C has been demonstrated to cause HCM phenotypes.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> On the other hand, CaMKII directly binds to the C terminus of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2 subunit and facilitates LTCC calcium currents through phosphorylation of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;2. In <italic>CACNB2</italic> mutation carriers, this process is inhibited and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents are further reduced. Considerable Ca<sup>2+</sup> is stored in the sarcomere, but mutant sarcomeres may trap more Ca<sup>2+</sup> than normal sarcomeres, causing a reduction in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current dysfunction is extremely evident in those severely affected HCM patients who carry both the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> and <italic>CACNB2</italic> mutations, which could explain the high rate of sudden cardiac death of these patients.</p></sec><sec><label>4.5</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>Several limitations should be acknowledged in our study. First, we used targeted NGS technology instead of a hypothesis-free approach such as exome or genome sequencing. However, our sequencing panel included all known causing genes and closely related genes of cardiomyopathy and channelopathy, which very likely cover the modifier gene if it exists. Second, the mechanism of how MYBPC3 interacts with CACNB2 remains undetermined in our study; we were unable to obtain the left ventricular tissue of HCM patients for functional analyses because consent of myocardial biopsy was not provided and none of these patients received heart transplantation or postmortem examination. More genetic evidence and functional experiments are needed to confirm our observations.</p><p>In this study, for the first time we showed that <italic>CACNB2</italic> is a possible candidate hypertrophy-modifying gene contributing to disease variability of <italic>MYBPC3</italic>-associated familial HCM. We provided a new possible mechanism of HCM pathogenesis, that is, a combination effect of sarcomere gene and channelopathy gene mutations, which however needs confirmation with more genetic evidence and functional experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-96-e7010-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e996" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the patients and their families for their participation in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: HCM = hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LVH = left ventricular hypertrophy, MYBPC3 = myosin-binding protein C, MYH7 = &#x003b2;-myosin heavy chain, NGS = next-generation sequencing, RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>X.Z. and J.X. contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 81600312).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maron</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ommen</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Semsarian</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
