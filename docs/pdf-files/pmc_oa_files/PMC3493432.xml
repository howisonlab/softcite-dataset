These small molecule inhibitors of STAT3 or Akt signaling are promising for developing anti-melanoma therapeutic agents. MLS-2438, a novel 7-bromoindirubin, a derivative of the natural product indirubin, was synthesized with a bromo-group at the 7-position on one indole ring and a hydrophilic group at the 3&#x02032;-position on the other indole ring. We tested the anticancer activity of MLS-2438 and investigated its mechanism of action in human melanoma cell lines. Here, we show that MLS-2438 inhibits viability and induces apoptosis of human melanoma cells associated with inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signaling. Several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are involved in the MLS-2438 mediated apoptosis. MLS-2438 inhibits Src kinase activity in vitro and phosphorylation of JAK2, Src, STAT3 and Akt in cultured cancer cells. In contrast to the decreased phosphorylation levels of JAK2, Src, STAT3 and Akt, phosphorylation levels of the MAPK (Erk1/2) signaling protein were not reduced in cells treated with MLS-2438. These results demonstrate that MLS-2438, a novel natural product derivative, is a Src inhibitor and potentially regulates kinase activity of JAK2 and Akt in cancer cells. Importantly, MLS-2438 suppressed tumor growth with low toxicity in a mouse xenograft model of human melanoma. Our findings support further development of MLS-2438 as a potential small-molecule therapeutic agent that targets both STAT3 and Akt signaling in human melanoma cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>bromoindirubin</kwd><kwd>indirubin</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>Src</kwd><kwd>JAK</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States and it is the most malignant type of skin cancer.

The major difference between the two compounds is the positions of the bromo-substitutions. 6BIO has a bromo-group at the 6-position, whereas MLS-2438 has a bromo-group at the 7-position. In this study, we have found the MLS-2438 is a Src inhibitor and inhibits phosphorylation of Src, JAK2 and Akt. These findings suggest that the bromo-substitution at the 7- position of indirubin molecule may modify the molecular binding affinity to different targets.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that Src could regulate the activity of Akt and JAK in cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><sup>38</sup></xref> In this study, MLS-2438 inhibited phosphorylation of Src, Akt and JAK2 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs.&#x000a0;4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). It is interesting that MLS-2438 displays differential inhibition among Src, Akt and JAK2 kinase activity in an in vitro system using recombinant kinases and relevant substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>). MLS-2438 is a Src inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.2 &#x003bc;mol/L, but not a JAK inhibitor in vitro. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of Akt inhibition is relatively high in an in vitro system. These findings suggest a possible interaction between Src and Akt, Src and JAK2 in cells and this interaction may potentially regulate their kinase activity in cells. The proposed mechanism of action is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>. MLS-2438 induces apoptosis of human melanoma cells at least in part associated with inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signaling pathways.</p><fig id="F6" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Figure&#x000a0;6.</bold> Schematic representation of MLS-2438-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells.

Currently there are limited effective drugs to treat metastatic melanoma. Several combination agents are available for treatment of melanoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><sup>40</sup></xref> MLS-2438 inhibits STAT3 and Akt signaling in melanoma, suggesting it may be a candidate for combination with the inhibitor of MAPK signaling, PLX 4032 or other inhibitors to treat metastatic melanoma more effectively by overcoming drug resistance.</p><p>MLS-2438 displays anticancer activity in various cancer cells. We used human melanoma as an example to investigate the mechanism of action for MLS-2438 and examined the three major signaling pathways, STAT3, Akt and MAPK, in human melanoma cells. Our results show that MLS-2438 selectively inhibits STAT3 and Akt signaling among these three major signaling pathways. However, we cannot exclude other signaling pathways being involved in melanoma, or other cancers. In summary, MLS-2438 is promising for development as a novel therapeutic agent targeting STAT3 and Akt signaling in melanoma and potentially other cancers. Furthermore, it may be more effective when combined with MAPK signaling inhibitors. Future studies will be directed toward in vivo pre-clinical evaluation of MLS-2438 using a metastatic tumor mouse model of human melanoma and other tumors.</p><p>In summary, we have found that MLS-2438 demonstrates potent anticancer activity and induces apoptosis of human melanoma cells associated with inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signaling. MAPK signaling is not involved in this induction of apoptosis. MLS-2438 is an inhibitor of Src and inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK2, Src and Akt in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that Src may regulate kinase activity of JAK2 and/or Akt in human melanoma cells. Importantly, MLS-2438 suppresses tumor growth in a MeWo human melanoma xenograft mouse model. Thus, MLS-2438 represents a promising lead compound for development of new anticancer therapeutics, especially targeting STAT3 and Akt in melanoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The preparation of 7-bromoindirubins including MLS-2438 has been described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><sup>31</sup></xref> The compound MLS-2438 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 20 mmol/L and stocked at -20&#x000b0;C before use for in vitro experiments and treatments in cells.
