Dying cells have been defined as apoptotic by distinguishing features, including cell contraction, nuclear fragmentation, blebbing, apoptotic body formation and maintenance of intact cellular membranes to prevent massive protein release and consequent inflammation. We now show that during early apoptosis limited membrane permeabilization occurs in blebs and apoptotic bodies, which allows release of proteins that may affect the proximal microenvironment before the catastrophic loss of membrane integrity during secondary necrosis. Blebbing, apoptotic body formation and protein release during early apoptosis are dependent on ROCK and myosin ATPase activity to drive actomyosin contraction. We identified 231 proteins released from actomyosin contraction-dependent blebs and apoptotic bodies by adapted SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) combined with mass spectrometry analysis. The most enriched proteins released were the nucleosomal histones, which have previously been identified as damage-associated molecular pattern proteins (DAMPs) that can initiate sterile inflammatory responses. These results indicate that limited membrane permeabilization occurs in blebs and apoptotic bodies before secondary necrosis, leading to acute and localized release of immunomodulatory proteins during the early phase of active apoptotic membrane blebbing. Therefore, the shift from apoptosis to secondary necrosis is more graded than a simple binary switch, with the membrane permeabilization of apoptotic bodies and consequent limited release of DAMPs contributing to the transition between these states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>blebbing</kwd><kwd>actomyosin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>DAMPs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Apoptosis allows for efficient and immunologically silent removal of damaged or superfluous cells in multicellular organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Despite &#x0003e;10<sup>9</sup> apoptotic events occurring per day in human adult tissues, it is surprisingly difficult to histologically detect apoptotic cells due to the rapid recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> A key feature of apoptosis has been defined as the maintenance of an intact cellular membrane (detectable as exclusion of impermeable dyes such as propidium iodide, PI) throughout the apoptotic program to prevent intracellular protein release and subsequent immunological activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> If the apoptotic cell is not recognized and cleared, this may be succeeded by secondary necrosis, during which cells lose membrane integrity, lyse and release intracellular contents including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that alert and activate innate immune cells leading to rapid sterile inflammatory responses, which aid in the resolution of the initiating cell/tissue damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> DAMPs are cellular constituents that are normally only exposed to innate immune cells when released from dying/dead cells. Cell surface sensors on immune cells that ordinarily recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns produced by infectious agents may also interact with DAMPs, leading to the activation of signaling pathways resulting in a nonpathogen-induced &#x02018;sterile' inflammatory response. Immune cell responses induced by DAMPs may include cytokine and chemokine release to activate inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The goal of these processes is detection and removal of dead cells and associated debris to limit potential further damage.</p><p>In addition to maintenance of membrane integrity, apoptotic cells can be discriminated from viable counterparts based on several morphological hallmarks, including cell contraction, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and actomyosin contraction-dependent membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The driving force behind apoptotic actomyosin contractility is caspase-mediated cleavage and consequent constitutive activation of ROCK1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Blebs are formed when the plasma membrane delaminates from the cortical cytoskeletal network to form blisters that are expanded by increased hydrostatic pressure produced by actomyosin-mediated cellular contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> As apoptosis progresses, blebs may break away from the cell body to form membrane-clad apoptotic bodies. A common assumption is that apoptotic bodies have a passive role in apoptotic cell clearance simply because they are smaller and therefore more readily phagocytosed than the intact cell body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Moreover, inhibition of ROCK activity significantly reduces apoptotic body formation and apoptotic cell phagocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Therefore, an additional possibility is that apoptotic bodies have active roles in promoting apoptotic cell clearance.</p><p>Apoptotic cells signal their demise by displaying markers such as phosphatidylserine that help phagocytes dock to the dying cell via direct or bridged interactions with recognition receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The membranes of apoptotic bodies present the same externalized signals to phagocytic cells, which similarly aids their recognition and clearance. However, we now show that unlike the membranes of the apoptotic cell body, a significant proportion of apoptotic body membranes do not form impermeable barriers, allowing for the limited macromolecule ingress and egress. Inhibition of actomyosin contraction through ROCK or myosin ATPase blockade reduces apoptotic body numbers formed during early apoptosis and concomitantly represses protein release without affecting the apoptotic program. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) identified nucleosomal histones, which are validated DAMPs, as the most highly enriched proteins released in an actomyosin-dependent manner before secondary necrosis. Stable isotope-labeled histones released from apoptotic cells were identified as being phagocytosed by macrophages. These results show that the progression from apoptosis to secondary necrosis does not occur as a two-state switch. Instead, as they are generated, the permeable membranes of apoptotic bodies allow the release of limited amounts of DAMPs that would locally engage with components of the innate immune system, thereby providing a mechanism that would contribute to a phased transition between apoptosis and full-blown secondary necrosis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Apoptotic bodies and blebs lose membrane integrity</title><p>The membrane-impermeable nucleic acid dye PI is often used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to categorize dead cells as either apoptotic (PI excluded) or necrotic (PI permitted).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Despite the general application of this binary classification, we observed that apoptotic blebs in NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with tumor necrosis factor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) plus cycloheximide (CHX) can permit PI penetration while the cell body continues to exclude the nucleic acid stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that shortly after blebbing onset (&#x0223c;4&#x02009;h after TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX treatment), newly formed blebs and apoptotic bodies (small membrane-encapsulated subcellular particles that dissociate from blebbing cells) appear that do not exclude PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, from 4&#x02009;:&#x02009;14&#x02009;:&#x02009;30, examples indicated by white, blue, yellow or red arrows).

Analysis of small subcellular debris (low forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> first panel) revealed that a large subpopulation of the 100&#x02009;000 counted apoptotic bodies were PI positive (defined by gatings that count &#x02264;1&#x00025; of autofluorescent apoptotic bodies in the absence of PI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> second panel), indicating that these apoptotic bodies not only contained nucleic acids but also allowed entry of 668&#x02009;Da PI molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> middle panel). Treatment of apoptotic bodies with RNAseA alone, or in combination with DNAse1, reduced PI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> fourth and fifth panels), indicating that molecules as large as RNAseA and DNAse1 (13 and 31&#x02009;kDa, respectively) accessed the interior of apoptotic bodies and degraded nucleic acid cargo, thus reducing PI fluorescence. The reduction in PI staining by RNAse&#x0002b;DNAse1 was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) following the induction of apoptosis 4&#x02009;h after treatment withTNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX, anti-CD95 (Fas receptor) antibody/CHX or ultraviolet light (UV) in NIH3T3 established mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), MCF10a human mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and primary mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These results indicate that whether the apoptotic stimulus was extrinsic or instrinsic, or whether the cells were primary or established, or epithelial or mesenchymal, a significant proportion of apoptotic bodies have membranes permissive for macromolecule passage. The permeability of apoptotic body membranes to macromolecules was additionally validated using NIH3T3 cells-expressing membrane-tagged green fluorescent protein (mGFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> left panel).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Following the induction of apoptosis for 4&#x02009;h, &#x0223c;33&#x00025; of resulting apoptotic bodies had mGFP fluorescence greater than the autofluorescence of apoptotic bodies from unlabeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> right panel). Treatment with Proteinase K (MW=28&#x02009;kDa) significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) reduced the proportion of GFP-positive apoptotic bodies by 70&#x00025;, indicating that most apoptotic bodies did not exclude Proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). When GFP-positive apoptotic bodies were incubated with PI in the absence or presence of RNAse&#x0002b;DNAse1, PI staining of the 11&#x00025; double GFP/PI-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) reduced by over 50&#x00025; through the actions of RNAse&#x0002b;DNAse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2h and i</xref>). These observations indicate that many apoptotic bodies failed to exclude molecules as large as 31&#x02009;kDa, suggesting that their membranes also would allow comparably sized molecules to escape.</p></sec><sec><title>Actomyosin contractility drives apoptotic body formation and lactate dehydrogenase release</title><p>We previously showed that apoptotic membrane blebbing results from caspase-mediated cleavage and consequent activation of ROCK1 to drive actomyosin contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that the typical pattern of membrane blebbing induced by TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX could be blocked by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> or the myosin ATPase inhibitor Blebbistatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). By collecting equal volumes of media from 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes of NIH3T3 cells that were untreated or treated for 4&#x02009;h with TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX, and then adding equivalent numbers of FITC-labeled polystyrene microbeads as a counting reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, left and middle panels), FACS analysis revealed that the small number of low FSC/SSC particles was greatly and significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) increased by TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, right panel), consistent with their being apoptotic bodies. Counting the apoptotic bodies from cells treated with TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX, anti-CD95/CHX or UV in the absence or presence of Y27632 or Blebbistatin revealed that actomyosin contraction inhibition significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) reduced apoptotic body formation following apoptosis induction by each stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, caspase activity induced by TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX, anti-CD95/CHX or UV was insensitive to Y27632 or Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), indicating that actomyosin contraction was required for apoptotic body formation, but not for apoptosis induction by these stimuli. Similarly, cleavage of the caspase substrate ROCK1 in TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX-treated cells was not affected by Y27632 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> inset). Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> and with the ROCK inhibitory action of Y27632, ROCK1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, inset panels) impaired actomyosin contractile force generation leading to significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) reduced apoptotic body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) and plasma membrane blebbing in a large proportion of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), without affecting caspase activation as determined by PARP1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, inset panels). We next measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, monomer MW=35&#x02009;kDa, tetramer MW=140&#x02009;kDa) activity in conditioned media, the release of which is often used to measure loss of membrane integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> LDH release was assayed in media from each of the four indicated conditions at 4 and 24&#x02009;h, relative to the amount of LDH released from cells induced to undergo necrotic death by three freeze/thaw cycles. Paralleling the effects on apoptotic body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), the increase in LDH activity present in apoptotic cell conditioned media (AC-CM) at 4&#x02009;h compared with untreated cells was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) reduced when actomyosin contractility was blocked with Y27632 or Blebbistatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, there was no effect of either inhibitor on LDH release 24&#x02009;h after apoptosis induction, consistent with protein release at this late time point resulting from loss of membrane integrity and lysis during secondary necrosis, which was unaffected by the inhibition of actomyosin contractility. In addition, release of the chromatin-associated nuclear high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1, MW=25&#x02009;kDa) into tissue culture media, which had GFP added as a processing/loading control, was undetectable at 12&#x02009;h after apoptosis induction but prominent in each condition at 24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), consistent with it being a later-released necrosis marker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> SEM revealed that TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX-treated cell morphology could not be distinguished from TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX&#x0002b;Y27632 or TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX&#x0002b;Blebbistatin-treated cells after 24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Although cells undergoing secondary necrosis released proteins such as LDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), their FSC/SSC profiles revealed that they largely remain intact with cells sizes smaller than healthy viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The ability of actomyosin contraction inhibitors Y27632 and Blebbistatin to suppress LDH release during early apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) was directly associated with the significant reduction in apoptotic bodies produced during early apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>),which would then allow limited protein release before complete loss of membrane integrity during secondary necrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteomic analysis of AC-CM by quantitative MS</title><p>Having established that a proportion of apoptotic bodies allow limited entry and exit of proteins, we sought to identify proteins released during early apoptosis, dependent upon actomyosin contractility, to drive blebbing and apoptotic body formation. To accomplish this, proteins were concentrated from conditioned media using StrataClean resin and separated on polyacrylamide gels. Similar to LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), there was a clear increase in bulk protein release 4&#x02009;h after treatment with apoptotic inducer, which was reduced by Y27632 or Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We then performed quantitative proteomic analysis using an adapted approach combining stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Individual NIH3T3 fibroblasts populations were grown in defined SILAC medium containing light (no isotope label), medium (Lys4, Arg6) or heavy (Lys8, Arg10) amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Each labeled cells population was assigned an experimental treatment: reference (untreated); apoptosis (TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX); apoptosis with reduced apoptotic body formation (TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/CHX&#x0002b;Y27632 or Blebbistatin) and six replicate experiments performed with each set of conditions cycled through the SILAC labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). After 4&#x02009;h, AC-CM was collected and pooled from each of the three conditions, followed by concentration and electrophoresis before tryptic digestion and analysis of protein tryptic fragments by MS. A hit-list was compiled of proteins that were significantly different (using a randomized permutation test, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) between treatment groups, which were enriched for release from apoptotic cells relative to control cells, and which were reduced by both Y27632 and Blebbistatin to inhibit actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, the top 20 released proteins are in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Using these criteria, 231 proteins were released from apoptotic bodies in an actomyosin-dependent manner, while the release of five extracellular matrix proteins were actually reduced (Fibronectin1, Sparc, Timp2, Thrombospondin2 and Decorin), which could be at least partially restored by Y27632 and Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Consistent with LDH as a protein validated for actomyosin-dependent release from apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), it also was identified in the MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). When fold enrichment in protein release was compared with protein mass, it was apparent that most proteins were &#x02264;100&#x02009;kDa, while the most abundantly released proteins were among the smallest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that most proteins were either enzymes or structural/adapter proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). After collecting apoptotic bodies by sorting, gel electrophoresis revealed Coomassie-stained proteins with a range of molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, left panel), whereas western blotting showed Lamin A and Gelsolin in apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, middle and left panels). These results indicate that even if proteins may be released, apoptotic bodies retain at least a proportion of their contents, including the proteins identified as being significantly released (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Relative to their proportions in the proteome, enzymes (<italic>P</italic>=3.18 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) and structural/adapter proteins (<italic>P</italic>=0.032) were over-represented among released proteins, whereas transcription factors (<italic>P</italic>=0.018) and receptors (<italic>P</italic>=5.55 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) were under-represented.

Further, these observations highlight a novel biological function for actomyosin-induced blebbing, which is to generate independent subcellular apoptotic bodies that could travel away from the apoptotic cell and release protein quanta that alert surrounding cells before secondary necrotic membrane breakdown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Protein release from apoptotic bodies would potentially increase the distance from which innate immune cells could detect apoptotic cells. Apoptotic bodies dispatching &#x02018;suicide notes' may be an important mechanism to trigger safe and rapid clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). In addition, some of these proteins released, such as histones, are taken up by macrophages, where they may influence information processing to influence the type, intensity and/or duration of cellular responses, or may be processed for antigen presentation. Histones and Vimentin, which were identified as phagocytosed by macrophages, are significant autoantigens in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, suggesting that apoptotic bodies could be a source of immunogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> These results also reveal that the transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis is not an off/on switch.
