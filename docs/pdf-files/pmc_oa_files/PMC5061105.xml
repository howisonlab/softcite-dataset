Quantitative changes in longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times in discrete brain regions have been described in a host of different pathologies <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. However, reproducibility for quantitative MRI measurements has proved a challenge and requires lengthy scan times to obtain parameters sequentially. Consequently, quantitative parameters are rarely acquired, and most evaluations of MRI images are based on visual inspection without quantitative evaluation of underlying values of T1 and T2.</p><p>Recently, a new approach of estimating multiple parameters at once, called MR fingerprinting (MRF), has been proposed <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. This method has the potential to be used for quantitative MRI routinely in both clinical and preclinical environments, enabling new tools for research and diagnosis. MR fingerprinting is based on the response of tissues to repeated acquisition sequences without attaining the steady state. Voxel&#x02010;wise responses are compared with a dictionary of simulated responses calculated from particular parameters (including, but not limited to, T1 and T2) and voxels are assigned the parameters from the best match to produce multiparametric maps.</p><p>To date, MRF has been performed with fast gradient echo sequences based on steady state free precession (SSFP). For fully rewound sequences, the simulations for the fingerprint database must include an estimate of the voxel&#x02010;wise frequency inhomogeneity for the correct signal evolution <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Estimates of frequency offsets are not required for gradient&#x02010;spoiled sequences <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. MRF methods have also been demonstrated in preclinical scanning of rodents <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. To apply the technique of MRF in small animals, where less B0 homogeneity is usually achieved, a gradient&#x02010;spoiled approach has been used.</p><p>Due to data redundancy between frames, MRF is well&#x02010;suited to acceleration by means of undersampling. When undersampling with a pseudorandom scheme, acquisitions are affected by noise&#x02010;like aliasing. The MRF technique has been shown to be remarkably robust to aliasing <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. This characteristic can be used to achieve alias&#x02010;free maps in short times. However, anti&#x02010;aliasing the MRI images before MRF pattern recognition is also possible <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Here, we tested a reconstruction method with a simple anti&#x02010;aliasing technique, sharing the edges of k&#x02010;space between neighboring MRF frames before comparing signal evolution traces with the fingerprint database.</p><p>Current MRF methods, both in the clinical and preclinical environment, have been demonstrated assuming a perfectly rectangular slice profile and homogeneous excitation. However, these assumptions are violated in most practical MRI experiments. Indeed, it has been shown that different pulse shapes used for slice selection produce different T2 values <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. In addition, inhomogeneous radiofrequency excitation profiles are a common problem in both preclinical and clinical high&#x02010;field scanners.</p><p>We have extended the MRF approach by including a parameter for B1 in the signal evolution dictionary. In addition, we have implemented a three&#x02010;dimensional (3D) acquisition and tested a new anti&#x02010;aliasing strategy applied before pattern recognition. The 3D acquisition has the advantage of broader coverage (particularly important for whole brain imaging) and the considerable reduction of slice profile effects. As well as B1 estimation, we incorporated slice profile correction into the MRF reconstruction algorithm. All of these advances are demonstrated in a rodent head using a small&#x02010;bore scanner.</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0006"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0007"><title>MRF Acquisition</title><p>Our scheme builds on SSFP MRF as recently reported <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Briefly, an inversion pulse is applied before a train of fast imaging with steady state precession readouts with variable flip angles and repetition time delays. These rapid changes prevent a steady state from being achieved, but rather lead to signal variations dependent on local magnetic properties and the applied B1 field. Phase encoding is applied before each readout and rewound afterward so that each train of readouts has the same phase encoding value and the whole sequence is repeated for each phase encoding step. In our implementation, we used a train of 1000 frames taking 10 s to acquire a single k&#x02010;line for all frames. To allow for return to equilibrium, we inserted a delay of 5 s before repeating the acquisition with a different level of phase encoding.</p><p>To increase the sensitivity to different B1 values, we changed the final part of the sequence from the original MRF approach as shown in Figure <xref rid="mrm26009-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. By using abrupt changes of the nominal excitation flip angle, our scheme introduces oscillations of signal the frequency of which is proportional to the obtained flip angle (Fig. <xref rid="mrm26009-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and independent from T2. This phenomenon has been previously described to perform B1 mapping using SSFP sequences <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. We used alternating blocks of 15 pulses of flip angle 90&#x000b0; followed by 15 pulses of flip angle 0&#x000b0; to exploit the oscillatory behavior of the signal to resolve the B1 field.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="mrm26009-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SSFP MRF schemes. <bold>A:</bold> the TR pattern used in all acquisitions. <bold>B:</bold> The FA pattern from the original SSFP MRF paper. <bold>C:</bold> The modified FA pattern demonstrated here, including abrupt changes in flip angle to increase the sensitivity to the B1 field.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-1" xlink:href="MRM-76-1127-g001"/></fig><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="mrm26009-fig-0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Simulation of the signal obtained with our novel MRF scheme (T1 = 160 ms T2 = 44 ms) at the end of the MRF train, in correspondence with abrupt changes in flip&#x02010;angle.

First, we investigated 2D MRF. We imaged agarose gel samples with different T1s and T2s. We used a Bruker BioSpec 47/40 system (Bruker Inc., Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with 400 mT/m gradients and a 12 cm diameter quadrature birdcage coil used as a transceiver. We used sinc pulse of 2 ms for excitation. Each signal acquisition was preceded by an adiabatic inversion pulse (15 ms hyperbolic secant). MRF acquisitions were performed at the magnet isocenter on a single slice (3 mm slice thickness; field of view 7 cm; 64 &#x000d7; 64 matrix yielding 1.1 mm resolution with 50 kHz receiver bandwidth).</p><p>To assess 3D MRF acquisitions, we used a matrix of 64 &#x000d7; 64 &#x000d7; 64 for 0.5 mm isotropic resolution of a uniform gel with a T1 of 640 ms and a T2 of 74 ms. We measured the average value obtained in a region of interest through the slice direction (<italic>z</italic>). We compared the following methods: the original MRF method (with no B1 in the dictionary); the original MRF scheme including B1 in the dictionary; our new method with abrupt changes in flip angle; and classical methods (described below).</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0009"><title>Brain Experiments</title><p>A formalin&#x02010;fixed Lister&#x02010;hooded adult rat brain was imaged using a 35&#x02010;mm&#x02010;diameter linear birdcage coil for both signal transmission and reception. For 2D MRF, we tried three different excitation pulse shapes: sinc, hermite, and gauss each of 2 ms and bandwidth factors 6.21, 5.40, and 2.74, respectively. Each slice had 0.5 mm thickness with a matrix of 64 &#x000d7; 64. For 3D acquisitions, we used a 64 &#x000d7; 64 &#x000d7; 64 matrix with 0.5 mm isotropic resolution (a 2 ms sinc excitation pulse as above was used).</p><p>As in the phantom acquisitions, each signal acquisition was preceded by an adiabatic inversion pulse (hyperbolic secant, length 15 ms, bandwidth factor 77.86). The receiver bandwidth was 50 kHz in each case.</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0010"><title>Undersampling and Anti&#x02010;aliasing</title><p>The scan time for the fully sampled 3D acquisition was 17 h 4 min (10 s MRF train + 5 s recovery time) &#x000d7; (64 &#x000d7; 64) phase encoding steps. To test our acceleration strategy, we retrospectively undersampled the 3D acquisition of the ex vivo rat brain. Our undersampling scheme consisted of a binary mask in the phase encode directions (k<sub>y</sub>&#x02010;k<sub>z</sub> plane) as shown in Figure <xref rid="mrm26009-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Nonlinear sampling based on a Gaussian distribution around the k&#x02010;space center was used with a uniform angular distribution. The Gaussian function had a standard deviation of 45% of the full k<sub>y</sub> and k<sub>z</sub> axes. Masks were created independently for each image frame. This could be implemented readily on a scanner by acquiring a list of pre&#x02010;planned k&#x02010;lines varying for each frame.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="mrm26009-fig-0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

First, zero&#x02010;filling of the unsampled points was used. Second, zero&#x02010;filling was combined with density&#x02010;correction for the sampled regions. Here, the correction was obtained using the inverse of the sampling probability density function used for generating the k&#x02010;space masks. Finally, we implemented a view&#x02010;sharing strategy where unacquired k&#x02010;space points were borrowed from the nearest frame with an acquired point at that location. As a result of our sampling density, points closer to the center, containing most of the contrast information, were acquired with higher temporal resolution. On the other hand, the edges of k&#x02010;space, changing less during the MRF signal evolution, were acquired at lower temporal resolution.</p><p>To test our undersampling strategy we prepared multiparametric MRF maps using data from the fully sampled k&#x02010;space. We compared maps obtained from 18%, 9%, and 5% of k&#x02010;space to values found using the full dataset. Values were measured in the whole brain and muscle tissue, which were automatically masked using thresholding. The thresholding criterion was of a T1 between 0 and 1 s, which included all brain and muscle for our formalin&#x02010;fixed sample.</p><p>To perform a time&#x02010;matched comparison of our view sharing technique, we compared the use of only 8% of k&#x02010;space for all frames with fully acquiring only the first 80 frames of the MRF sequence. We compared root mean square errors relative with full sampling. For this experiment, aimed at evaluating the efficiency of the acquisition only, we excluded B1 from the dictionary.</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0011"><title>MRF Reconstruction</title><p>Signal simulations were performed using extended phase graphs <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, including gradient de&#x02010;phasing as well as radiofrequency pulses and signal evolution. The pattern recognition reconstruction was implemented following <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. All code for simulation and pattern recognition was written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The dictionary contained values of T1 ranging from 80 ms to 1000 ms in steps of 20 ms, and from 1 to 2.5 s in steps of 50 ms. Values of T2 ranged from 10 ms to 100 ms in steps of 2 ms and from 105 ms to 250 ms in steps of 5 ms. B1 was modelled by a flip&#x02010;angle factor, a linear factor equal to the obtained flip angle divided by the desired flip angle. Values for this parameter were simulated from 50 to 150% in 2% increments.</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0012"><title>Comparison with Classical Estimation of T1, T2, and B1</title><p>The quantitative maps using each scheme were compared with standard estimation of T1, T2 and B1 using manufacturer&#x02010;provided sequences. T1 and T2 were estimated using spin&#x02010;echo sequences with the same field of view (FOV) and matrix as the MRF acquisitions. The MRF scan times were compared with scan times from the manufacturer&#x02010;provided T1+T2 RARE relaxometry sequence, with unchanged sequence parameters [multiecho spin echo; echo time (TE): 11, 33, 55, 77, 99 ms; repetition time (TR) 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000, 4500 ms; number of excitations (NEX), 1] on the same geometry. For more accuracy, in our classical measurements we increased the number of sampled points and averages and used single echoes rather than multiecho to reduce the impact of system imperfections. However, for comparison of the time taken we used the acquisition time of the unmodified sequence. T1 was estimated with a spin echo sequence with variable TR (TR: 10,000, 3000, 1500, 800, 400, 200 ms; TE: 11 ms; receiver bandwidth 48 kHz, 3 NEX). T2 was estimated with single&#x02010;echo spin&#x02010;echo acquisitions with variable TE (TR: 2500 ms; TE: 12, 36, 48, 60, 84, 108, 216, 324, 500 ms; receiver bandwidth 60 kHz, 1 NEX). The B1 field was estimated using the double&#x02010;angle method <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Two gradient echo images were acquired with a flip angle of 45&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0; on with the same FOV of the MRF acquisitions (TR/TE 15,000/2.9 ms, excitation with sinc pulse of 2 ms duration, receiver bandwidth 78 kHz, 1 NEX).</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0013"><title>Slice Profile Correction for 2D MRF</title><p>Due to slice profile imperfections, the flip angle seen by spins varies across the slice and includes some contribution from spins outside the slice. To account for these effects in the MRF dictionary, a novel correction method was developed. The Shinnar&#x02010;Le Roux algorithm <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> was used to create a slice profile of 128 partitions based on the pulse waveforms used by the scanner. The extended phase graph simulation was performed for the central flip angle of each of the 128 partitions producing an MRF train for each. The signal of each frame was summed over each partition to create a dictionary for each pulse waveform that takes account of the variability in flip angles experienced across the slice. We compared MRF maps derived from slice&#x02010;profile corrected and the original dictionaries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0014"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Reconstruction time for the parametric maps (including B1) from each slice was less than 1 min. Figure <xref rid="mrm26009-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> compares estimates of T1, T2, and B1 from our acquisitions with the original MRF train of delays and flip angles, our modified scheme and the standard spin echo method. Good agreement was seen between techniques for T1 with less than 5% discrepancy between methods. We found that the previously reported MRF sequences did not successfully resolve T2 and B1 effects with substantial errors in the estimation of both. Our new method, as a result of abrupt changes in flip angle, was able to better discriminate between these parameters. However, this 2D MRF acquisition did not provide a complete separation of T2 and B1 due to slice profile effects, and B1 maps systematically underestimated (&#x0003e;10%) the true values when using a 2D acquisition.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="mrm26009-fig-0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Results comparing the original MRF scheme, our modified scheme with abrupt changes in flip angle (dFA) and the maps using classical methods (described in methods).

This is particularly important for the application of MRF to small&#x02010;bore preclinical scanners where small RF coils may have significant inhomogeneity. The inclusion of B1 effects will be of growing importance, as these are problematic for body imaging at both 3T and 7T <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> and brain imaging at 7T <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.</p><p>Images in MRF scans can be reconstructed from undersampled k&#x02010;space, as the MRF reconstruction &#x0201c;sees through&#x0201d; aliasing <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. However, anti&#x02010;aliasing strategies may permit higher undersampling factors. Here we have successfully demonstrated a simple strategy to deal with undersampled k&#x02010;space acquisitions. In our scheme, non&#x02010;acquired k&#x02010;space points in one frame are &#x0201c;borrowed&#x0201d; from neighboring frames where these had been acquired. This concept, similar to keyhole imaging <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, is based on the fact that the image contrast is mainly in the center of k&#x02010;space, while the image details, which are unchanged between frames, are in the edges of k&#x02010;space. Therefore, the signal evolution is estimated well when only the central part of k&#x02010;space is updated in subsequent frames.</p><p>When doing slice selective imaging, different locations in the slice are excited with a different flip angle leading to partial volume effects. In MRF, partial volume effects have a different behavior with respect to conventional imaging <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. In conventional imaging, different sub&#x02010;voxel areas are averaged within a voxel, while MRF tends more toward the most represented sub&#x02010;voxel area, as it can be noted when using different pulses in Figure <xref rid="mrm26009-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, where B1 is not homogeneous throughout the voxel. We demonstrated that the slice profile can be directly included in the simulation, performing independent calculations for single sub&#x02010;voxel areas using slice profiles derived from the Shinnar&#x02010;Le Roux algorithm <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Residual errors in T2 are likely due to nonideal behavior of the RF transmission pipeline. To check this, we used actual flip angle imaging <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> to measure the mean flip angle in a uniform phantom achieved when different pulse shapes were used. The measured flip angles were found to be factors of 1.07 for sinc, 1.06 for hermite, and 0.96 for gauss pulses. Introducing these factors for flip angles into the dictionary reduced the errors but further investigation of imperfect RF transmission was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>The adverse effects of slice distortion can be largely mitigated when selecting a large slab for 3D imaging, as in this case the slice profile problem becomes part of the B1 estimation. When estimating parameters through the slice, we saw unbiased results with our new method. However, we still observed underestimation of T2 in the outermost partitions. Future acquisitions with non&#x02010;selective pulses could offer a better solution for an extended coverage. Previous work in the context of radial k&#x02010;space acquisition found that 3D scans offer more possibility of undersampling the k&#x02010;space with respect to 2D slices <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Another advantage of 3D imaging is its applicability to brain imaging cohort studies. Brain imaging methods to compare groups of subjects usually benefit from isotropic 3D acquisitions to meaningfully compare regions after image registration <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. In addition, whole&#x02010;brain coverage can be achieved in a single acquisition when using 3D MRF methods.</p><p>By accelerating the acquisition more than 10&#x02010;fold, our method is significantly faster than MRF protocols currently available for small animals <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. The undersampling technique described here can be used to significantly shorten scan times, and achieve acquisition durations suitable for in vivo imaging of rodents. Current techniques for voxel&#x02010;wise comparison of rodent brains include voxel&#x02010;based morphometry <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> and tensor&#x02010;based morphometry <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. However, both approaches are more concerned with image geometry rather than the signal levels seen, as a consistent wide&#x02010;spread approach for quantitative imaging between centers has not appeared to date in the literature. Fully quantitative, 3D acquisitions could be used in this context to obtain standardized multicenter data for analysis of different disease models and treatments.</p><p>The scan times obtained here, of the order of 1.5 h, can be used in the preclinical environment, however, they would be prohibitive in human studies. The efficiency of our method is limited when compared with the gold standard of human quantitative imaging featuring acceleration with compressed sensing and parallel imaging. The introduction of array coils, as well as more sophisticated anti&#x02010;aliasing strategies, could be used to further accelerate MRF acquisitions. Using iterative reconstruction such as compressed sensing is a promising strategy for anti&#x02010;aliasing the images before pattern recognition <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. However, the large size of 4D datasets represents a challenge for iterative algorithms, and new strategies are needed to deal with the high computational demand. For instance, new compressed sensing algorithms based on fast, dedicated processing units of high&#x02010;performance graphics cards (GPUs) developed for cardiac MRI hold promise for reconstruction of large MRF datasets <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. In addition, fast algorithms such as split Bregman could be used to accelerate compressed sensing of large datasets <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, perhaps including spatiotemporal total variation constraints <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>.</p><p>In the current implementation, we waited for full relaxation (5 &#x000d7; T1) between acquiring k&#x02010;space lines. However, this is not necessary to perform MRF. In the future, optimized MRF acquisitions could be used to further shorten scan times. In addition, non&#x02010;Cartesian methods have been demonstrated in the preclinical environment as well as for clinical scanners. Non&#x02010;Cartesian acquisitions yield better efficiency and anti&#x02010;aliasing of undersampled data with respect to Cartesian in several preclinical applications, e.g., Buonincontri et al <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. MR fingerprinting has already been demonstrated using arbitrary gradient waveforms, for instance derived from music to increase patient's comfort <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Although the use of spiral trajectories has shown great speed benefits for MRF in clinical scanners, we are unaware of implementations of spiral MRF in small&#x02010;bore MRI scanners. The use of novel 3D non&#x02010;Cartesian strategies could further accelerate the acquisition bringing 3D, isotropic MRF methods into both preclinical and clinical applications. Direct reductions in scan time can also be achieved by reducing the number of frames <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>.</p><p>Including the slice profile correction increased the computational burden of the dictionary creation proportionally to the number of partitions used. However, this correction had no impact on the pattern recognition algorithm, as the dictionary size remained unchanged. It took approximately a minute per slice to reconstruct the MRF data here, and this is a reasonable time frame. It is possible to include further parameters in the reconstruction though this is prohibitive as the reconstruction time will scale exponentially with the number of parameters. Reconstruction times and memory occupancy represent the largest current limitation of MRF. New methods to meaningfully compress the dictionary <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and perform more sophisticated matching <xref rid="mrm26009-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> are currently being studied. New reconstruction methods could permit the measurement of more parameters simultaneously, such as T2* and diffusion, enhancing the sensitivity of novel MRF techniques.</p></sec><sec id="mrm26009-sec-0016"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We have demonstrated a method for incorporating B1 estimation into MRF and extended the protocol to 3D imaging.
