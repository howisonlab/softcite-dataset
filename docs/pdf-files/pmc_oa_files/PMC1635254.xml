Subtraction or methylation-dependent digestion with <italic>Mcr</italic>BC was used with optimized (MMASS-v2) or previously described (MMASS-v1, MMASS-sub) methylation-sensitive enzyme combinations and compared with a published <italic>Mcr</italic>BC method. Comparison was performed using DNA from the cell line HCT116. We show that the distribution of methylation microarray data is inherently skewed and requires exogenous spiked controls for normalization and that analysis of digestion of methylated and unmethylated control sequences together with linear fit models of replicate data showed superior statistical power for the MMASS-v2 method. Comparison with previous methylation data for HCT116 and validation of CpG islands from <italic>PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB</italic> and <italic>TSEN2</italic> confirmed the accuracy of MMASS-v2 results. The MMASS-v2 method offers improved sensitivity and statistical power for high-throughput microarray identification of differential methylation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epigenetic changes are heritable changes that include reversible covalent modifications of histone proteins and methylation of DNA. The vast majority of mammalian DNA methylation is located at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides which are particularly frequent within CpG islands. The definition of a CpG island continues to evolve but the following criteria are currently accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>): a length &#x02265;500 bp, G + C content &#x02265;50% and CpG dinucleotides at an observed-to-expected ratio &#x02265;0.60. Approximately 70% of mammalian genomic CpG dinucleotides are methylated and commonly occur within repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In contrast, most unmethylated CpG islands span the promoter regions of house-keeping genes and tumour suppressor genes and are critical in gene expression regulation and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>The number of cancer-related genes inactivated by epigenetic modifications may equal or exceed the number inactivated by genetic mutations or allele loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Therefore, the development of high-throughput methods to characterize methylated and unmethylated CpG islands in normal and neoplastic tissues is vital to enable discovery of methylation markers for cancer predisposition as well as understanding the role of DNA methylation in neoplastic progression and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Differential methylation hybridization (DMH) is an array-based method for comparing the methylation status of CpG islands between test samples and a common reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The two DNAs are first digested with MseI to reduce the size of genomic fragments followed by a combination of methylation-sensitive enzymes that only restrict unmethylated recognition sequences. The MseI recognition sequence (TTAA) is found frequently within bulk DNA, but is rarely found within CpG islands which remain intact after digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Subsequent linker-mediated PCR results in amplicons that are enriched for methylated sequences. The labelled amplicons are competitively hybridized and the ratio of test to reference signal intensities at each probe on the array reflects methylation differences between the two samples. Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) modified this method by using digestion with a methylation-dependent enzyme, the homing endonuclease <italic>Mcr</italic>BC. This enzyme has a degenerate methylation recognition sequence that only cleaves methylated DNA and is very frequent in CpG islands. Amplicons from digested DNA therefore represent unmethylated sequences, and competitive hybridization of amplicons from <italic>Mcr</italic>BC digested and undigested DNA from the same sample was used to identify methylated sequences by within-sample comparison. This avoided the need for a common reference design which is advantageous for profiling clinical samples where no appropriate reference tissue may be available or where the available reference sample may not have a &#x02018;normal&#x02019; methylation pattern. However, a potential disadvantage of the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method is that there is unequal representation of methylated and unmethylated sequences in a single hybridization and this may reduce sensitivity to detect differential methylation.</p><p>Previous DMH profiling studies used microarrays for which the full sequences of the probes, and consequently their restriction map sites, were unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). This prevented rational design of the digestion steps and rigorous analysis of probe performance to exclude artefactual errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). For example, if a probe sequence lacks the restriction site for a methylation-sensitive enzyme that digests unmethylated target, the signal from this probe will be falsely assigned as methylated. In this work, we used bioinformatic tools to provide detailed annotation of all probes on a publicly available CpG island array and used this information to develop and validate a high-throughput method called microarray methylation assessment of a single sample (MMASS). We show that MMASS offers improved sensitivity to profile methylated as well as unmethylated CpG islands from single samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell line</title><p>HCT116 colon cancer cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

The thermocycling conditions were 5 min at 72&#x000b0;C to fill in the overhanging ends of the ligated DNA fragments, followed by 21 cycles (25 cycles for the MMASS-v2 method) of 1 min at 94&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 65&#x000b0;C and 3 min at 72&#x000b0;C, with a final extension for 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C. Five microlitres of the PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and a diffuse smear pattern between 0.2 and 2kb was taken to indicate successful PCR amplification as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Labelling and hybridization</title><p>For each methylated and unmethylated amplicon 300 ng of PCR product was vacuum dried and resuspended in 33 &#x003bc;l of water with 2.5&#x000d7; random primer buffer (BioPrime Labeling Kit; Invitrogen) together with 0.5 ng of control <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cDNA (synthesized from pARAB obtained from the Microarray Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) and denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Each denatured sample was placed on ice with 7.5 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x000d7; dNTP mixture (2 &#x003bc;M each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, and 0.35 &#x003bc;M dTTP), 1.8 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM aminoallyl-dUTP together with 80 U Klenow Fragment and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h then stopped with 5 &#x003bc;l of stop buffer (BioPrime Kit). The total volume was increased to 425 &#x003bc;l with water and unincorporated aminoallyl-dUTP was removed by two centrifugations at 10&#x02009;000 r.p.m. using a Microcon YM30 concentrator (Millipore). Purified sample was collected by centrifuging the inverted column at 4500 r.p.m. for 5 min and then vacuum dried. Each sample was reconstituted in 4.5 &#x003bc;l of water together with 4.5 &#x003bc;l Cy dye (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate titrated with sodium hydroxide to pH 9.0. The mixture was held at room temperature in the dark for 1.5 h and the coupling reaction was stopped by adding 4.5 &#x003bc;l of 4M hydroxylamine and 35 &#x003bc;l of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Labelled DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification column and then vacuum dried. Both dye-coupled DNAs were then resuspended together in 85 &#x003bc;l of DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Diagnostics) together with 5 &#x003bc;l of salmon sperm DNA (10 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l) and denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The hybridization mixture was allowed to cool briefly and 5 &#x003bc;l of yeast tRNA (10 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l) was added and the mixture was held at 65&#x000b0;C for 2 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Hybridization to the microarray was carried out under a cover slip in a humidified chamber at 37&#x000b0;C for 8 h. The cover slip was floated off in 1&#x000d7; SSC and each slide was washed three times in 1&#x000d7; SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50&#x000b0;C for 15 min followed by removal of SDS at room temperature in 1&#x000d7; SSC and 0.1&#x000d7; SSC for 5 min each. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 r.p.m. for 5 min and scanned immediately using the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon). The settings for PMT gain were adjusted during the initial rapid scan to achieve a balance between the two channels and these settings were used for the high resolution scan.

The majority of the library was subsequently fully sequenced by the University Health Network Microarray Centre, Toronto (sequences available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://derlab.med.utoronto.ca/CpGIslands/"/>). After BLAST comparison to the human genome 5435 out of 13&#x02009;056 (41.6%) probes were selected that had a percentage identity of &#x0003e;97% and &#x0003c;30% masked repeat elements and these were annotated as single copy sequences. A further 1190 probes (9.1%) contained 100% repeat sequences and the remainder was either not identifiable or had an intermediate percentage of repetitive sequences. The restriction sites for all commercially available methylation-sensitive enzymes were identified for unique probes together with the distance to the nearest neighbouring genes and the percentage and type of included repetitive sequences (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p>From these analyses, we found that 4160 out of 5435 (76.5%) of the probes on the CpG array would be informative when using the previously described combination of BstUI, HpaII and HhaI enzymes to generated representations of methylated target DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). We predicted that using a novel combination of four enzymes (AciI, HpaII, HinP1I and HpyCH4IV) would utilize 4403 out of 5435 (81%) of the array probes and therefore improve utility. In addition this combination of enzymes was more convenient as all four enzymes could digest efficiently in the same buffer. In contrast, digestion with BstUI, HpaII and HhaI required a two-step digestion protocol with an additional purification step.</p><p>We hypothesized that the sensitivity of array-based methylation detection could be improved if greater contrast could be achieved between methylated and unmethylated signal. We therefore evaluated two different methods for generating representations of unmethylated sequences. First, we used McrBC to digest methylated DNA in one-half of the sample for comparison against digestion with the combinations of methylation-sensitive enzymes above (MMASS-v1 and MMASS-v2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, we used subtractive hybridization using a subtractor DNA digested with BstUI, HpaII and HhaI (MMASS-sub; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Exploratory data analysis</title><p>For each of the methods we obtained four microarray hybridizations, using replicate biological preparations in a balanced dye-swap design and compared the results to the method of Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>.

DNA from the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 was used for all experiments as methylation patterns have been well characterized in this cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>The overall quality of individual hybridizations was assessed by inspection of <italic>MA</italic> and spatial plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) for each of the arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and Supplementary Sweave document). Unsatisfactory array experiments were repeated and 16 high-quality hybridizations were obtained from a total of 19 experiments.</p><p>Log ratios (<italic>M</italic>) for control <italic>A.thaliana</italic> probes showed little variation around <italic>M</italic> = 0 indicating high reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Inspection of blank spots showed uniform low intensities as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to <italic>MA</italic> plots from expression array and array CGH experiments, the distribution of log-ratios from MMASS and Nouzova experiments was not symmetrical. It is important to note that for the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method the log-ratios should theoretically all be positive, as a mixture of methylated and unmethylated sequences was directly compared to unmethylated sequences. Comparison between arrays showed that each method had a characteristic distribution of data points on the <italic>MA</italic> plot that was highly consistent between replicate experiments. For the MMASS-v2 and the MMASS-sub methods there was a bimodal distribution of log-ratios at higher probe intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) indicating increased separation between methylated and unmethylated sequences.</p><p>We evaluated different strategies for optimum normalization of each method and these are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Sweave document. The <italic>A.thaliana</italic> probes proved unreliable for location normalization except for the MMASS-v2 method where pipetting error was well controlled, allowing the use of median correction (Supplementary Figure S1). Replicate arrays for the MMASS-v1 and Nouzova methods were sufficiently comparable after global loess normalization. For the MMASS-sub method, normalization was performed using a subset of high-intensity methylated clones that demonstrated consistent log-ratios between replicate arrays (Supplementary Figure S2).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of differentially methylated probes</title><p>For each of the methods we fitted a linear model followed by empirical Bayes smoothing to obtain <italic>B</italic> statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) so that probes could be ranked by the likelihood of differential methylation. Volcano plots summarizing the results showed striking differences in the <italic>B</italic> statistics obtained from each method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Most notably, the Nouzova method gave a very low and limited range of <italic>B</italic> statistics demonstrating a lack of power to assess methylation. In contrast, the MMASS-v2 and MMASS-sub methods resulted in much higher <italic>B</italic> values indicating better assessment of methylation. However, compared to the MMASS-v2 method, the MMASS-sub method was more variable as shown by the wide spread of points with low <italic>B</italic> values in the MMASS-sub method volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The MMASS-v2 method resulted in markedly higher <italic>B</italic> values than the MMASS-v1 method. The poor discrimination of the Nouzova data was surprising. To exclude artefact caused by our use of indirect labelling or different hybridization conditions, we repeated the original protocol exactly as described for four additional arrays. No significant increase in performance was obtained by using the unmodified protocol (Supplementary Sweave document).</p><p>We next examined results for mitochondrial DNA and repetitive element probes as these are known to be substantially unmethylated and methylated, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The <italic>MA</italic> plots showed the mitochondrial DNA to be consistently unmethylated in data from the MMASS methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However the Nouzova <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method had poor sensitivity for distinguishing unmethylated mitochondrial genes. Ranking by <italic>B</italic> statistics showed that the top unmethylated probes were mitochondrial DNA sequences and that the most methylated probes were repeat elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is important to note that as mitochondrial and repetitive sequences are present in high copy number in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) and over-represented on the HCG12K arrays (see earlier), more consistent probe measurements would be expected, making it easier to detect differential methylation for these probes as compared to single copy genes.</p><p>We then assessed the effect of spiking <italic>in vitro</italic> methylated and unmethylated target DNAs into the hybridization samples as positive and negative controls for the detection of methylated and unmethylated sequences. We first labelled 32 candidate spikes and hybridized them to two HCGI12K arrays to test the stringency of hybridization (Supplementary Figure S3). Eight spikes which showed correct hybridization and had the largest spike effects (Supplementary Figure S4) were selected for further analysis. Adequacy of <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation was confirmed with BstUI digestion (Supplementary Figure S5) and spikes that were poorly methylated or that had inconsistencies between predicted and actual DNA sequence were excluded from analysis. The spikes were added to two hybridizations for each method leaving the remaining two unspiked so that background measurements for spiked probes could be established.</p><p>To quantify the amount by which the spikes were digested, we calculated the spike effect at each of the four methylated and unmethylated spiked probes and compared this to the spike remaining after digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4). For unmethylated spikes, the largest spike effect was seen for probes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref> and h where almost complete digestion by the MMASS-v1 and MMASS-v2 methods was observed. As expected there was minimal digestion by the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method as McrBC does not restrict unmethylated sequences. The spike effect at probes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> e and f was too small to allow meaningful interpretation. For methylated spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>a&#x02013;d) the largest digestion effect was observed for the MMASS-sub and MMASS-v2 method. However the subtraction process could also have attenuated the spiked sequences, increasing the apparent effect. There was little digestion effect seen for the Nouzova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and MMASS-v1 methods.</p><p>To validate the results for single copy genes, we selected 14 probes randomly within low, medium and high average probe intensity (<italic>A</italic>) ranges and compared results from array hybridizations from each MMASS method with independent assessment by COBRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table 3). Although COBRA only surveys two to four CpGs in an amplicon, our experience in cancer samples is that this gives a good indication of the methylation status of the locus. Results from probes with <italic>A</italic> values higher than the median intensity of the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> control spots were more consistent with the COBRA results and these higher intensity probes were also more consistent across all MMASS methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Supplementary Table 3).</p><p>The MMASS-sub method resulted in greatest separation between the methylated and unmethylated COBRA validated clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The ranking of the MMASS probes by degree of methylation was consistent with full and partial methylation results detected by COBRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Supplementary Table 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of methylation of cancer-related genes</title><p>We then examined 325 single copy probes identified by the MMASS-v2 method with values of <italic>B</italic> &#x0003e; &#x02212;3 as this cut-off was consistent with the COBRA validation experiments (Supplementary Table 4). From these, 22 were selected that were proximal to genes reported previously as having cancer-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), including DNA replication and repair (<italic>PMS2L4, MCM7</italic> and <italic>BRCA1</italic>) and tumour suppressor function in colorectal cancer (<italic>SFRP2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Validation of the methylation status of five CpG islands (<italic>PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB</italic> and the unmethylated housekeeping gene <italic>TSEN2</italic>) confirmed correct array results using COBRA or MSP (Supplementary Figure S7). Our array result for <italic>HNRPA2B1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) was not in agreement with previous data that has shown it to be unmethylated in HCT116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) but we were unable to obtain a satisfactory MSP result to confirm this (data not shown). The reproducibility of the MMASS-v2 method was also demonstrated by the finding of very similar <italic>B</italic> values for several duplicate probes from single copy genes, including <italic>MCM7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Figure S8).</p><p>We also examined array data from 23 probes representing 9 genes (<italic>SYK, ZFP37, DIRAS3, RARB, LMX1A, DAPK1, SFRP2, FAT</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic>) that have been reported previously to be methylated in HCT116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Inspection of <italic>MA</italic> and volcano plots for each of the four methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) showed that the MMASS-v2 results were most consistent with previous data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Genomic profiling of methylated and unmethylated sequences using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization to microarrays is a potentially powerful and convenient technique. However, in contrast to work carried out on expression microarray data, no detailed assessment of the effects of different protocols or analysis methods has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). We have developed and optimized new restriction enzyme methods to profile both methylated and unmethylated sequences within a single sample.</p><p>The three MMASS methods resulted in very consistent data representation between replicate experiments but there were marked differences in sensitivity. The MMASS-sub method increased the power to resolve methylation differences as compared to the previously published Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method, but also increased noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The subtraction steps were time consuming, and there remains a theoretical disadvantage that the subtraction may compound errors caused by partial digestion. For example, an excess of the partially digested sequences in the subtracter DNA amplicon could result in disproportionate removal of target DNA and a skewed representation of methylation. The MMASS-v2 method resulted in better representation of the methylation status of the target DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and had less noise, and therefore increased power, as compared to other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This may be in part because of better digestion of unmethylated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As additional fresh enzymes were added in the MMASS-v2 method and digestion was carried out in a single step using one buffer&#x02013;enzyme combination, minimizing potential loss of sample.</p><p>The poor performance of the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method was surprising and cannot be explained simply by technical reasons, such as failure of McrBC digestion, as all experiments were carried out using the same conditions, batch of enzyme and <italic>in vitro</italic> methylated spikes. In addition, the dynamic range for probe data was very similar between our Nouzova experiments and the original publication. It is possible that other effects such as array quality or the higher genomic complexity of the amplicon from the undigested DNA (containing unmethylated and methylated sequences) may have altered spike-probe hybridization results. However in contrast to MMASS, the Nouzova method has very poor sensitivity for detecting hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) such as mitochondrial spots.</p><p>The mixtures being compared by hybridization may have had strong effects on sensitivity. The direct comparison of methylated to unmethylated representations appears more sensitive (larger <italic>M</italic> values) than comparisons to a mixture of methylated and unmethylated sequences as in the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method. The MMASS methods resolved with high precision the methylation status for repetitive and mitochondrial target DNAs as these are represented in high copy number in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). They also were able to resolve single copy CpG methylation and identify correctly the methylation status of a number of CpG islands which have been described previously to be methylated or unmethylated in HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>The bioinformatic analysis of methylation array data is very different to that of expression data in which symmetrical distribution of log-ratios is assumed and the main aim of normalization is to remove dye bias. We show here that data distributions from different methods are inherently skewed and may be bi-modal at high intensities. It is not possible to estimate how much asymmetry to expect since this will depend upon the method used and global levels of methylation in the samples. We have carefully investigated and applied appropriate methods for these analyses. From these data it is clear that proper normalization is fundamentally reliant on exogenous controls including the spiked <italic>A.thaliana</italic> cDNA used here, but better reagents are needed. Significant collaborative efforts are now underway for designing reproducible control spikes for expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). It is important to note that use of simplistic location-based normalization in other datasets is likely to have prevented detection of real effects and combining probe-level data between different datasets that have used different methods and comparator DNAs may be impossible to achieve.</p><p>We were able to optimize our methods by using bioinformatic tools to identify and annotate the predicted probe sequences on the HCGI12K array and to identify the optimum set of restriction enzyme sites to maximize probe utilization. Optimization of this enzyme set was based on analysis of 5435 CpG island sequences and therefore likely to be of high utility to other CpG island platforms. This may also have contributed to the improved effects seen with the MMASS-v2 method. However, our analysis was limited by the low number of informative probes caused by inclusion of repeat and nonsense sequences from the original library. Improved array platforms with better representation of all CpG islands across the genome, as well as fine mapping within individual CpG islands, are now needed for detailed studies.</p><p>MMASS has several advantages over current high-throughput methods; e.g. MMASS in common with DMH employs a universal primer complementary to the ligated adaptor rather than a complex sequence-specific primer design such as in methylation-specific oligonucleotide microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and MALDI mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Methylation analysis using BAC microarrays requires the use of rare cutting methylation-sensitive enzymes which limits resolution to a single BAC probe, or only provides an average estimate of methylation across a large genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Other methods that have used within-sample comparison methylation analysis have either used non-optimized enzyme combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) or complex specific linker/enzyme pairings that have not been shown to improve sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). MMASS is able to resolve the overall methylation status of a single copy CpG island probe on a spectrum from mostly unmethylated to mostly methylated. Our results also show that in contrast to DMH and the Nouzova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) method, we were able to detect unmethylated sequences such as housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This will be particularly important in the context of the human epigenome project and for cancer studies where comparison is needed for both methylated and unmethylated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>A.E.K.I. conceived the study, conducted the microarray experiments and drafted the manuscript.
