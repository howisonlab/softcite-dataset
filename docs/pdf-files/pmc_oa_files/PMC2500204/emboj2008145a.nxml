Filament activity must be tightly regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> as unrestrained HR can cause genomic instability. Our mechanistic understanding of HR is restricted by lack of structural information about the regulatory proteins that control filament activity. Here, we describe a structural and functional analysis of the HR inhibitor protein RecX and its mode of interaction with the RecA filament. RecX is a modular protein assembled of repeated three-helix motifs. The relative arrangement of the repeats generates an elongated and curved shape that is well suited for binding within the helical groove of the RecA filament. Structure-based mutagenesis confirms that conserved basic residues on the concave side of RecX are important for repression of RecA activity. Analysis of RecA filament dynamics in the presence of RecX shows that RecX actively promotes filament disassembly. Collectively, our data support a model in which RecX binding to the helical groove of the filament causes local dissociation of RecA protomers, leading to filament destabilisation and HR inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genomic stability</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>RecA</kwd><kwd>RecX</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is necessary for the accurate repair of double-strand (ds) breaks in the DNA and is crucial for maintaining genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">van Gent <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">West, 2003</xref>). The conserved RecA-like DNA strand-exchange proteins are DNA-dependent ATPases that polymerise on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form a right-handed nucleoprotein filament, the molecular species that performs the homologous pairing and strand-exchange reactions of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brendel <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Roca and Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bianco <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lusetti and Cox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Schlacher <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cox, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2007b</xref>). Uncontrolled recombination can lead to genomic instability and as a result the activity of the nucleoprotein filament is finely tuned by a range of regulatory mechanisms that can promote or repress HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Sung and Klein, 2006</xref>). In bacteria, RecA activity is modulated by a growing network of functional interactions that are only partially understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cox, 2007b</xref>). The single-strand-binding (SSB) protein coats exposed ssDNA, removing DNA secondary structure in the process and inhibiting binding of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kowalczykowski and Krupp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lavery and Kowalczykowski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hobbs <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The RecBCD complex degrades the ends of a dsDNA break and loads RecA on the resulting 3&#x02032;-end ssDNA tail in preparation for strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kowalczykowski, 2000</xref>). The RecR, RecO and RecF proteins cooperate to promote RecA filament assembly on gapped DNA coated with SSB, possibly limiting filament extension onto dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Umezu <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Umezu and Kolodner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shan <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Webb <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bork <italic>et al</italic>, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2003</xref>). RecF is also capable of promoting RecA filament activity by counteracting the effect of the negative regulator RecX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lusetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The DinI protein stabilises RecA filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lusetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), whereas the role of PsiB and RdgC in RecA filament activity is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailone <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The UvrD helicase can disassemble RecA filaments <italic>in vitro</italic> and may be involved in destabilising recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Mendonca <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Morel <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Veaute <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli recX</italic> gene is located immediately downstream of the <italic>recA</italic> gene. Both genes are expressed from the same cistron, which is under the transcriptional control of the LexA repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pages <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, a DNA hairpin between the <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>recX</italic> genes allows 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; transcriptional read-through of the <italic>recX</italic> gene, resulting in lower levels of the RecX protein relative to RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pages <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The RecX protein is required to overcome the effect of overexpressing RecA, suggesting that RecX is a negative regulator of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Papavinasasundaram <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Vierling <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Sukchawalit <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).

Taken together, the evidence indicates that RecX represses HR by interfering with RecA functionalities.</p><p>The mechanism by which RecX regulates recombination is still unclear. Electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of AMP&#x000b7;PNP-stabilised RecA filaments on dsDNA in the presence of nearly stoichiometric concentration of RecX revealed that RecX can bind within the helical groove of the RecA nucleoprotein filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). As a result, it was suggested that repression of recombination might occur by steric clash of RecX with the strand-exchange reaction, as well as by prevention of the ATP-coupled allosteric changes in RecA that are required for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). An alternative model for RecX-dependent inhibition of recombination was based on its proposed ability to cap the growing 3&#x02032;-end of the RecA filament, resulting in net disassembly of RecA protomers and eventual dissolution of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we describe a structural and functional analysis of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecX protein and its interaction with the RecA nucleoprotein filament. The crystal structure of RecX reveals a modular architecture of tandem helical repeats, which is strongly suggestive of a mechanism of interaction with the RecA filament. We define a conserved, positively charged surface of RecX as important for its inhibitory function and test this assumption by defining RecX mutants with weakened ability to repress RecA function <italic>in vitro</italic>. The structural and biochemical data are complemented by a functional analysis that demonstrates how RecX actively promotes RecA dissociation from established filaments. We integrate our findings and existing data in a model of RecX function, which provides a novel example of the variety of mechanisms that regulate HR by interference with the activity of the nucleoprotein filament.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modular architecture of the RecX structure</title><p>Initial crystallisation trials with wild-type RecX were unsuccessful. Mutation of cysteine residues 113 and 118 to alanine generated a version of the RecX protein that yielded crystals suitable for high-resolution X-ray analysis. The crystal structure was solved to a resolution of 1.8 &#x000c5; using the anomalous signal of selenomethionine-derivatised protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the crystals, two RecX chains related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis share an unusually large interface that buries 2800 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of solvent-accessible surface. The homodimeric form of RecX appears to be an artefact of crystallisation because we could not detect it in solution using size-exclusion chromatography, homo-bifunctional chemical crosslinking (not shown), or sedimentation velocity in an analytical ultracentrifuge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The mutagenesis required to induce crystallisation did not impair RecX function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The crystallographic analysis demonstrates that RecX is a modular protein, consisting of three copies of a three-helix bundle of approximately 50 amino acids each that assemble in tandem repeats, resulting in an elongated protein shape of approximate overall dimensions of 70 &#x000c5; &#x000d7; 20 &#x000c5; &#x000d7; 20 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The relative arrangement of the three repeats imparts a moderate degree of curvature to the long axis of the RecX structure, resulting in a somewhat flat concave surface on one side and a convex surface on the other side of the molecule. Despite the low degree of sequence similarity, the three repeats can be superimposed with an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.7 &#x000c5; over 37 aligned C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the modular nature of the RecX structure could not be detected by inspection of the amino-acid sequence, structural superposition of the three repeats identifies several residues that are preferentially occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). The most likely explanation for their conservation is their important structural role in RecX folding. Amino acids 113 and 118, which were mutated from cysteine to alanine to induce crystallisation, occupy solvent-exposed positions on the convex side of the protein.</p><p>Structural comparison of the RecX structure against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive in SSM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/</ext-link>) did not find any reliable match, suggesting that the RecX fold is unique. However, the structure of the isolated RecX repeat represents a convincing 3D match for helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domains found in homeodomain transcription factors and site-specific recombination enzymes: RecX repeat 2 can be superimposed to the Oct-1 POU homeodomain of PDB entry 1POG with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 &#x000c5; over 41 C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). A weaker structural similarity can also be detected between a RecX segment spanning repeats 1 and 2 and the two HTH modules of the MarA transcriptional activator (PDB entry 1BL0). Thus, RecX extends our knowledge of tandem repeat proteins as a remarkable example of protein architecture assembled by consecutive copies of an HTH-like domain. The finding that the RecX repeats resemble DNA-binding domains raises the possibility that RecX might bind DNA. Published evidence shows that RecX can bind both ss- and dsDNA, but the functional relevance of these observations is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Stohl <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Galvao <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of the RecX structure reveals the presence of considerable repeat&#x02013;repeat interfaces: inter-repeat contacts bury 779 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> and 965 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of accessible surface area at the 1&#x02013;2 and 2&#x02013;3 repeat interfaces, respectively. The tight packing of the repeats fixes their relative orientation and confers overall rigidity to the structure. Notable common features of the repeat&#x02013;repeat interface include the presence of a conserved glycine residue in the tight connection between helices II and III of repeats 2 and 3 (G100 and G151, respectively), which allows for close head-to-tail packing of helix II in the three repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The interface between repeats 2 and 3 is particularly extensive: W117 at the N terminus of helix I in repeat 3 links the interior of repeats 2 and 3 in an hydrophobic continuum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The smaller hydrophobic component of the interface between repeats 1 and 2 is compensated for by additional polar interactions: particularly prominent are the partially buried, bidentate interactions linking the carboxylate of D71 at the N terminus of helix I in repeat 2 to the main chain nitrogen atoms of E29 and Q30 in repeat 1; and the carbonyl moiety and N&#x003b6; nitrogen atom of K99 at the C terminus of helix II in repeat 2 with the side chains of S28 and E31, respectively, in helix II of repeat 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surface properties of the RecX structure</title><p>The available evidence indicates that RecX regulates HR by direct interaction with the RecA nucleoprotein filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>). To gain an insight about the structural epitopes of the molecule that might be responsible for protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, we analysed the charge distribution of the RecX surface. The outstanding feature of the electrostatic properties of RecX is the opposite polarity of the charge distribution on its concave and convex sides: the concave face of RecX is almost uniformly positively charged, whereas the convex face is predominantly negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, the electrostatic analysis of the RecX surface indicates that RecX is a highly polarised molecule and suggests that the peculiar charge distribution of the protein might have an important role in its function.</p><p>Solvent-exposed regions of a protein that are involved in functional interactions with other macromolecules are subject to stronger evolutionary pressure and therefore show a higher degree of amino-acid conservation than otherwise expected for surface residues. We used the ConSurf server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://consurf.tau.ac.il/">http://consurf.tau.ac.il/</ext-link>) to map the extent of phylogenetic conservation of RecX residues on our crystallographic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Landau <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The structure-based phylogenetic analysis highlights another striking aspect of the RecX protein: the solvent-exposed amino acids on the concave face of the protein present a higher degree of conservation relative to residues of the convex side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of the concave surface of RecX reveals the presence of an extensive network of side chain&#x02013;side chain interactions involving basic and aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The program CaPTURE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gallivan and Dougherty, 1999</xref>) identifies five of these contacts as energetically significant cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions: F78&#x02013;R82, R82&#x02013;Y87, Y87&#x02013;R150, K128&#x02013;F146 and R145&#x02013;Y149. The mesh of cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; contacts immobilise the side chains of conserved basic residues R82, K128, R145 and R150, thus keeping them poised for potential interaction. The potential for hydrophilic interaction of the concave surface is augmented by side chains of R25, K35, R91, K99, R127 and K142 that line the perimeter of the cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interaction network.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure-based mutational analysis of RecX function</title><p>Examination of the RecX structure suggested that its conserved, positively charged concave face might represent a functional surface. We therefore selected for mutagenesis the conserved lysine and arginine residues R25, K35, R127, K128, R145 and analysed the ability of the mutant proteins to inhibit RecA activity. The functional importance of the selected amino acids was tested by mutation to glutamic acid, which reverses the charge of the residue while preserving its hydrophilic nature. In the case of residues participating in cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; contacts (K128 and R145), mutation was to methionine, to maintain the hydrophobic component of the interaction. The RecX mutants were tested for their ability to suppress the ATPase and strand-exchange activities of the RecA filament. The experiments were performed with a range of RecX concentrations to explore the variation in potency between the mutant and wild-type proteins.</p><p>All RecX mutants showed reduced inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by the RecA filament relative to wild-type RecX, albeit with considerable differences in their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Examination of the concentration dependency of RecA inhibition allowed ranking of the RecX mutants as: R25E&#x0003e;R145M&#x0003e;K128M&#x0223c;K35E&#x0003e;R127E, in order of decreasing efficacy. R25E was the most effective mutation, extinguishing RecX-dependent inhibition almost completely even at the highest concentration tested (0.8 &#x003bc;M; 1:2.5 ratio of RecX to RecA). The results of the strand-exchange inhibition experiments confirmed that R25E is the most effective single-point mutation in compromising RecX function, whereas the R145M mutant displayed only a mild impairment and the K35E, R127E, K128M mutants behaved similar to wild-type RecX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). A double mutation of R25E and R127E showed the strongest effect on RecX-dependent inhibition, rendering the protein virtually inactive in both ATPase and strand-exchange assays at all tested concentrations.</p><p>These observations implicate conserved basic residues on the concave surface of RecX in the repression of RecA filament activity. The solvent-exposed R25 in the linker between helices I and II of repeat 1 appears to be particularly important for RecX function. However, the involvement of spatially distant residues in RecX's inhibitory function suggests that the integrity of all or most of the concave surface of RecX is required for optimal function.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Interaction of RecX with the RecA filament</title><p>The structure of RecA&#x02013;dsDNA&#x02013;AMP&#x000b7;PNP filaments in the presence of RecX, at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of RecX to RecA, was investigated by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The EM analysis detected additional density located deep inside the helical groove of the RecA filament, which was attributed to RecX. The selection for 3D reconstruction of filament segments enriched in RecX density and the helical averaging of the filament structure resulted in a continuous tubular density wound around the filament axis. Docking of the crystallographic model of RecX in the EM reconstruction reveals that the volume and shape of the protein fit well into the additional RecX-associated density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Although it is impossible to fix the position of RecX in the continuous density of the reconstructed filament, it is clear that the curvature of the RecX structure appears well suited to match the helical groove of the filament. As a result of the docking, the conserved, functionally active concave surface of RecX faces inwards towards the filament axis, in a suitable position to interact with both DNA and RecA. We note that the strongly basic nature of the concave surface of RecX would complement the polyanionic nature of DNA and the overall negative charge of the RecA C terminus, which mediates in part the interaction with RecX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2004b</xref>). Taken together, the functional analysis of RecX mutants and the docking of the RecX structure into the EM reconstruction of the RecA&#x02013;RecX nucleoprotein filament suggest that RecX inhibits RecA functions by binding within the helical groove of the filament through its positively charged, concave surface.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RecX actively removes RecA from nucleoprotein filaments</title><p>After nucleation on ssDNA, RecA filaments grow by the net addition of RecA protomers to the 3&#x02032;-end of the filament and shrink by net release of RecA protomers from the 5&#x02032;-end; a higher rate of RecA binding at the 3&#x02032;-end relative to the rate of RecA dissociation at the 5&#x02032;-end results in increased filament size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lindsley and Cox, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shan <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bork <italic>et al</italic>, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Galletto <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Joo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Drees <italic>et al</italic> (2004a)</xref> suggested that RecX performs its inhibitory function by binding to the 3&#x02032;-end of the RecA filament, in a manner that prevents further addition of RecA protomers to the growing end of the filament. As filament disassembly continues unimpeded from the 5&#x02032;-end, &#x02018;capping' of the 3&#x02032;-end by RecX would lead over time to filament dissolution.</p><p>We chose to test current models of RecX function by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Nucleoprotein filaments were generated by binding RecA to a 5&#x02032;-biotinylated ssDNA (60-mer oligo-dT) immobilised on a streptavidin (SA)-coated sensor chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). RecA was injected into the flow cells until the binding curve indicated that maximal saturation had been achieved. We confirmed that the dynamic behaviour of RecA filaments reconstituted on the SA chip was as previously reported by examining the dependency of RecA dissociation on ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lindsley and Cox, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arenson <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Galletto <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Joo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The RecA filaments were then challenged by flowing RecX over the sensor chip. The set-up of the SPR experiment was designed so that it would be possible to discriminate between &#x02018;passive' and &#x02018;active' mechanisms of RecX action. In fact, no RecA binding can take place after the initial injection, while dissociating RecA molecules are removed by the continuous flow in the system. Therefore, capping of the RecA filament at its 3&#x02032;-end by the injected RecX would not alter the rate of RecA dissociation from the filament. Alternatively, any RecX-dependent mechanism involving active RecA removal from an established filament would alter the kinetic profile of filament disassembly.</p><p>The SPR analysis shows that RecX increases the rate of RecA dissociation from the filaments in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). The two RecX mutants, R25E&#x02013;R127E and R145M, are impaired in their abilities to increase the rate of RecA filament disassembly compared with wild-type RecX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>), a result that mirrors the effect of these mutants on RecA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. To test whether the effect of RecX depends on the ability of RecA to hydrolyse ATP, we reconstituted RecA filaments in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP&#x000b7;PNP. AMP&#x000b7;PNP increases considerably the rate of RecA binding to ssDNA, while causing a decrease in the rate of filament disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). These observations agree with the augmented stability reported for RecA filaments formed in the presence of AMP&#x000b7;PNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) or ATP&#x003b3;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chabbert <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arenson <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Galletto <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Joo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cisse <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). RecX increases the rate of RecA dissociation in a concentration-dependent manner, as observed for ATP. However, the effect of RecX on RecA dissociation is less pronounced in the absence of RecA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we have investigated the structural basis for the role of the RecX protein in HR. The crystal structure of RecX reveals an unanticipated modular architecture of three tandem repeats of a three-helix domain, bearing a clear resemblance to well-known DNA-binding HTH domains similar to the homeodomain. Thus, the crystallographic analysis of RecX increases our knowledge of the predominantly eukaryotic HTH domain by demonstrating its deployment in a novel structural and functional context. Furthermore, using a sequence profile derived from the structural superposition of the three repeats of <italic>E. coli</italic> RecX, it is possible to identify two additional repeats in the N- and C-terminal tails of a subset of RecX sequences that exceed the consensus size by about 100 amino acids (data not shown). The existence of polypeptides spanning five repeats confirms the modular nature of the RecX protein.</p><p>We identify the concave, positively charged face of the extended, curved protein shape as functionally important: mutations of conserved basic residues on the concave surface reduce the ability of RecX to inhibit RecA's ATPase and strand-exchange activities and to induce RecA filament depolymerisation. The phylogenetic and biochemical analyses indicate that the functionally relevant portion of the RecX surface is rather extensive, suggesting an intimate association of RecX with the protein and nucleic acid components of the RecA filament. Several conserved basic residues on the concave surface of RecX participate in an extended network of cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions, which constrain the basic side chains in a way that makes them poised for interaction. Involvement of functionally important side chains in a mesh of cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions might reduce the entropic cost associated with formation of a intermolecular interface and might also confer additional overall rigidity to the RecX structure.</p><p>By combining the crystal structure of RecX with the EM reconstruction of RecA&#x02013;RecX filaments, it is possible to infer the mode of RecX interaction with the filament. EM analysis of RecA&#x02013;dsDNA filaments stabilised by the ATP analogue AMP&#x000b7;PNP and in the presence of functional excess of RecX revealed additional density in the helical groove of the filament. Docking of the crystallographic model of RecX into the EM reconstruction showed a good agreement between the curved, elongated shape of the protein and the additional, tubular density present deep in the groove of the filament. Taken together, the structural and biochemical data indicate that RecX associates with the filament by arranging its elongated shape along the bottom of the continuous filament groove, with its positively charged concave side facing towards the axis of the filament, poised to interact with both protein and DNA. When bound to the filament, the elongated shape of RecX would permit contact with up to three consecutive RecA protomers, and could conceivably bridge RecA molecules on successive rungs of the filaments.</p><p>The structural evidence presented here does not support a mode of RecX binding that involves the specific recognition of the extremities of the RecA filament. In addition, the SPR analysis of the effect of RecX on the dynamic behaviour of RecA filaments shows that RecX actively promotes the dissociation of RecA from the filament. Accordingly, a satisfactory model of RecX's role in HR should account for its ability to bind anywhere along the filament and for its active role in promoting filament disassembly. Clearly, current mechanistic proposals of RecX function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">VanLoock <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>) need to be integrated in a new model that can explain all the evidence now available. Thermodynamic considerations predict that filament disassembly does not ensue by dissociation of RecA protomers from internal sites of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">McGhee and Von Hippel, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Schwarz and Watanabe, 1983</xref>). Indeed, single-molecule fluorescence assays demonstrated that RecA protomers dissociate preferentially from filament ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Joo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Thus, to promote filament disassembly RecX must either enhance the rate of RecA dissociation per filament end or increase the actual number of ends. We favour the latter proposition as it accounts for RecX's ability to bind anywhere along the filament. We propose that binding of RecX within the helical groove of the nucleoprotein filament might facilitate the removal of one or more RecA protomers, thus generating a discontinuity in the RecA coating of the DNA. Dissociation of RecA would then commence from the newly generated 5&#x02032;-end, whereas the continuing association of RecX near the newly created 3&#x02032;-end would prevent further addition of RecA protomers. Thus, the extent of RecA dissociation would be proportional to RecX concentration: the more RecX molecules bind to the filament, the more filament interruptions would occur, therefore increasing the overall rate of filament disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which nucleoprotein filament activity is regulated during HR is still limited. We were initially motivated to investigate the molecular basis of RecX function by the realisation of functional similarities in the ability of RecX and the BRC repeat sequences of the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 to disassemble nucleoprotein filaments. This study has uncovered a structurally novel mechanism of HR regulation, based on a modular protein architecture that has evolved to interact directly within the groove of the nucleoprotein filament. The novelty of our findings hints at a fascinating range of regulatory mechanisms that awaits structural and biochemical characterisation.</p><p>The crystal structure of pre- and postsynaptic RecA&#x02013;DNA complexes was reported while our paper was under revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). These crystallographic models allow for the first time the visualisation of ss- and dsDNA within the RecA nucleoprotein filament. Molecular docking of the RecA&#x02013;dsDNA complex (PDB entry 3CMX) in the EM reconstruction of the RecA&#x02013;RecX&#x02013;dsDNA filament confirms that RecX can interact with both protein and nucleic acid components of the filament through its concave surface. Furthermore, the docking analysis shows that filament-bound RecX would be well positioned to make extensive contacts with the phosphate backbone of the postsynaptic strand of DNA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cloning, mutagenesis, expression and purification of proteins</title><p>The <italic>recX</italic> gene was amplified from <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA and a nucleotide sequence coding for amino acids 9&#x02013;166 of the RecX protein was cloned into the &#x02018;Gateway' (Invitrogen) expression system following the manufacturer's protocol.

(<bold>B</bold>) Structural superposition of the three repeats of RecX. Colour coding is as in (A). The side chain of a highly conserved hydrophobic residue in helix II of the three repeats (L36, L96 and L147) is shown in ball-and-stick representation; its position in the multiple sequence alignment of (D) is marked with a black triangle.

Similar residues are in cyan, identical residues in yellow and completely conserved residues in green. The position of the three alpha-helices for each of the three repeats is marked above the alignment; the helices are coloured as in (A). The alignment is split into three parts according to repeat boundaries. The sequences of the repeats are arranged so that structurally equivalent residues are vertically aligned over the three repeats. A sequence insertion in the alignment of the N-terminal repeat is shown to the right side of the alignment.
