There are typically two serotypes of HSV: HSV type 1 (HSV-1), which is more frequently found in the oral mucosal and ocular areas and HSV type 2 (HSV-2), which is most commonly encountered as the causative agent of genital infection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, confused infection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are currently detected due to disorganized habits (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, both HSV-1 and 2 have been regarded as the most common cause of genital ulceration in humans worldwide (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Moreover, HSV infection via the genital route results in the establishment of a lifelong latent infection, which subsequently provides potential transmission to neighbor hosts in response to reactivation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, increased acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported in HSV-infected individuals (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective therapeutic strategies for HSV-infected patients.</p><p>Because the virus is prevalent in the human population, the development of therapeutic strategies rests on an understanding of how each component of the innate and adaptive immune systems responds to HSV infection. Using multiple animal models, the role of innate and adaptive immune cells has been defined. It is believed that HSV replication is initially limited to the epithelium of the mucosa (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and subsequently spreads into the central nervous system (CNS) upon retrograde transport of virions into the sacral ganglia, resulting in a fatal paralysis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The majority of research demonstrates that innate immune responses, including natural killer (NK) and NKT cells as well as monocytes, play an important role in conferring protective immunity against genital HSV infection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Moreover, effectively generated CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 immunity is essentially required for protection against primary or secondary HSV infection via the mucosal route (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, orchestrated infiltration of effector innate and adaptive immune cells, such as NK and T cells, in mucosal tissues appears to be essential for effective protection against HSV infection. In addition, soluble factors, such as type I IFNs (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;), IL-12, and IL-18, produced from innate and adaptive immune cells reportedly play a crucial role in conferring protection against HSV infection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Specifically, NK cells are critical for HSV control owing to their direct or indirect mechanisms of recognizing and killing infected cells through the secretion of granzyme B, perforin, or the antiviral cytokines interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The activity of antiviral NK cells is regulated by endogenous cytokines, such as type I IFNs and IL-2 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and exogenous materials including synthesized and natural compounds (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The flower (flos) buds of <italic>Daphne genkwa</italic> (Thymelaeaceae) are commonly used in traditional folk medicine as a diuretic for the treatment of ascites, edema, and asthma in Korea and China, although their specific biological activities have not been defined yet (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The medicine also was found to have anti-cancer effects on malignant ascites and tumors (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The phenolic constituents of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> exhibit anti-complementary activities (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Furthermore, the flower buds of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> were recently reported to induce the functional recovery of exhausted CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated during chronic viral infection (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), suggesting that <italic>D. genkwa</italic> is useful in the treatment of chronic diseases. The experiments presented here were undertaken to determine whether vinegar-processed flos of <italic>D. genkwa</italic> (vp-genkwa) regulate the mortality and clinical signs associated with mucosal HSV-1 infection. Our data indicate that oral treatment of vp-genkwa after mucosal HSV-1 infection alleviates the mortality and clinical signs induced by viral infection through enhancement of NK cell activity. Therefore, this result provides a valuable insight into the use of vp-genkwa to control clinical severity in HSV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and ethical considerations</title><p>BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice (6- to 8-weeks old) were purchased from Samtako Co.

The vinegar-processed Genkwa Flos (vp-genkwa) was produced, as described elsewhere (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Briefly, the dried and powdered Genkwa Flos was equally mixed with 4% vinegar diluted in H<sub>2</sub>O (v/v), placed in a moist closed container for one night, transferred to a drug-parching machine to dry at 180&#x02103;, and removed promptly thereafter (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The dried powder (3 kg) was extracted twice with 3 volumes of room-temperature ethanol. The extract (199 g) was evaporated, freeze dried, and stored at 4&#x02103; before use. The analysis of the vp-genkwa components was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS chromatogram. Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis was performed using an ACQUITY UPLCTM system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and photodiode array (PDA). The organic solvents used for extraction were of first grade, and acetonitrile and water for UPLC were purchased as analytical grade from Honeywell (Morristown, NJ, USA). The chromatographic separations were performed on a 2.1&#x000d7;100 mm, 1.7-&#x000b5;m ACQUITY HSS T3 C18 chromatography column. The column temperature was maintained at 35oC, and the mobile phases A and B comprised water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The gradient duration program was as follows: 0 min, 20% B; 0~1 min, 20% B; 1~6 min, 20~80% B; 6~8 min, 80~98% B; 1-min wash with 98% B; and a 2-min recycle time. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min.</p></sec><sec><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>The HSV-1 McKrae strain was propagated in Vero cells (CCL81; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) using DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml). The Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, and then incubated in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 1 h at 37&#x02103;. After absorption, the inoculums were removed, and 10 mL of maintenance medium containing 2.5% FBS was added. Approximately 48~72 h after infection, a culture of host cells that showed an 80~90% cytopathic effect was harvested. The virus stocks were then concentrated by centrifugation at 50,000&#x000d7;g, titrated using a plaque assay, and stored in aliquots at -80&#x02103; until needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal infection</title><p>The mice were treated with progesterone to synchronize their estrous cycles (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) prior to intravaginal (i.vag.) infection with the HSV-1 McKrae strain. Briefly, BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with Depo-Provera (DP) (Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI, USA) at 2 mg per mouse. Five days following DP injection, the mice were i.vag. infected with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of HSV-1 McKrae strain (20 &#x000b5;l) per mouse. The infected mice were examined daily for vaginal inflammation, neurological illness, and death, as described previously (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). They were scored from 1 to 5 depending on clinical disease severity (0, no inflammation; 1, mild inflammation; 2, moderate inflammation; 3, severe inflammation; 4, paralysis; 5, death).</p></sec><sec><title>Viral titration in vaginal lavages</title><p>Vaginal lavage fluid was obtained by introducing 100 &#x000b5;l of PBS (pH 7.2) into the vaginal canals and then recovering it with a micropipette.

Individual subsamples (50 &#x000b5;l from each sample) were further diluted, and viral titers were determined by a plaque assay performed on Vero cells as described elsewhere (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis of NK cell activity</title><p>The mice were treated with vp-genkwa before and after HSV-1 infection, and the splenocytes were prepared from infected mice 3 days post-infection (dpi). NK cells were enumerated by FACS staining using a cocktail of CD3 (145-2C11), NK1.1 (PK136), and NKp46 (29A1.4.9) antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). To determine the activity of NK cells, we used intracellular staining for IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B (GrB) in response to stimulation of PMA (750 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) plus ionomycin (50 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, prepared splenocytes were cultured with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of monensin (2 &#x000b5;M; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h for IFN-&#x003b3; and 4 h for GrB. Cells were harvested and labeled with CD3, NK1.1, and NKp46 antibodies, and subsequently stained with intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; and GrB after fixation and permeabilization. All samples were acquired on FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, Mountain View, CA, USA), and analyzed by FlowJo software (ver. 7.6.5; Tree Star, San Carlos, CA, USA). Forward scatter and side scatter were used to identify lymphocytes, which were further used to define NK cell and intracellular expression of IFN-&#x003b3; and GrB.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of vaginal IFN-&#x003b3; secretion</title><p>Vaginal lavage fluid for IFN-&#x003b3; secretion was collected 3 dpi by introducing 100 &#x000b5;l of PBS (pH 7.2) into the vaginal canal and then recovering it with a micropipette following infection of synchronized mice with the HSV-1 McKrae strain. The vaginal mucus was subsequently removed from the fluid by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. IFN-&#x003b3; levels in vaginal lavages were determined by ELISA using IFN-&#x003b3; anti-mouse Ab (R4-6A2) and biotinylated IFN-&#x003b3; Ab (XMG1.2). The ELISA plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h, and then the color was developed.

Subsequently, we examined infected mice daily until 15 dpi. Our results revealed that pre-treatment of vp-genkwa had no effect on mortality and clinical signs, compared to the group treated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). However, somewhat intriguingly, mice that were treated with vp-genkwa (10 mpk) after HSV-1 infection showed enhanced resistance (p=0.0605), as well as alleviated clinical signs, compared to mice that received vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). Furthermore, higher doses of vp-genkwa (50 mpk) did not provide increased protection against mucosal HSV-1 infection, indicating that enhanced protective immunity against HSV-1 infection may be achieved with treatment of vp-genkwa at optimal doses after infection. Therefore, these results suggest that treatment of vp-genkwa at an optimal dose after HSV-1 infection provides enhanced protection, while pre-treatment of vp-genkwa before HSV-1 infection does not affect the associated mortality and clinical signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of vp-genkwa reduces viral burden following HSV-1 infection</title><p>Because treatment of vp-genkwa (10 mpk) after infection offered increased protection against mucosal HSV-1 infection, we examined viral secretion in vaginal lavages of mice that received vp-genkwa (10 mpk) before and after HSV-1 infection. Consistent with the previous results, vp-genkwa treatment before HSV-1 infection showed no regulatory role in the control of viral secretion in vaginal lavages, whereas vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection reduced viral titers in vaginal lavages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, this result indicates that vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection might control HSV-1 replication in the vaginal tract.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased NK cell activity in vp-genkwa-treated mice following HSV-1 infection</title><p>Vaginal infiltration of innate leukocytes, such as granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, are thought to contribute to HSV infection resistance via direct and indirect mechanisms (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, NK cells reportedly play a crucial role in regulating vaginal inflammation caused by HSV-1 infection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, we decided to explore the regulatory role of vp-genkwa treatment on NK cell activity. First, we determined the frequency and absolute number of CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup>NK cells in the spleen of mice treated with vp-genkwa before and after HSV-1 infection 3 dpi. In spite of vp-genkwa treatment before and after HSV-1 infection, our results did not indicate any changes in the frequency or absolute number of NK cells, except that vp-genkwa treatment before HSV-1 infection slightly increased the percentage of NK cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, intriguingly, vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection increased the frequency and absolute number of IFN-&#x003b3;- and granzyme B-producing NK cells, whereas pre-treatment with vp-genkwa before HSV-1 infection did not affect the frequency or absolute number of IFN-&#x003b3;- and granzyme B-producing NK cells (Fig. 3B and C). These data indicate that vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection increases NK cell activity because IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B expressed on activated NK cells are involved in eradicating virions and killing virus-infected cells. Supportively, secreted IFN-&#x003b3; was detected at higher levels in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection, compared to that of mice treated with vehicle and vp-genkwa before HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the enhanced resistance of mice treated with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection is closely associated with increased NK cell activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Examination of genital HSV infection using a murine model has significantly contributed to our understanding of the role of innate and adaptive immune cells during vaginal inflammation and CNS-invasion. In the present study, we demonstrated using a murine infection model that treatment with vp-genkwa at optimal doses after, but not before, HSV-1 infection provides enhanced resistance, as reflected by reduced mortality and clinical severity. Further, the reduction in viral secretion in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after infection supported the observed decrease in the clinical signs caused by mucosal HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, the reduction in mortality and clinical signs in mice treated with vp-genkwa after viral infection was closely associated with enhanced NK cell activation, which indicates the involvement of NK cell activation in vp-genkwa efficacy in the HSV-1 infection model. Therefore, our data suggest that vp-genkwa is a valuable tool for controlling the clinical severity caused by mucosal HSV-1 infection.</p><p>NK cells are innate immune cells effective against different kinds of viruses, including influenza virus, HSV, and hepatitis B virus, thereby indicating a general role of these cells in potent antiviral immune responses (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The complex function of NK cells is achieved by the production of several immunomodulatory cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, as an indirect mechanism, and the direct killing of virus-infected cells through secretion of granzyme B and perforin in cell-to-cell contact (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Specifically, the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; is an important feature of activated NK cells because IFN-&#x003b3; plays a crucial role in various immunological processes such as the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). There have been various attempts to activate NK cells using immunomodulatory molecules derived from endogenous bioactive molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, several materials derived from chemically synthesized or natural resources were found to be effective forms of drug therapy for chronic diseases, such as cancer and viral infections, through NK cell activation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although the molecular networks through which NK cells are activated by vp-genkwa are not clear, our data is strengthened by recent findings that genkwadaphnin, derived from the flower buds of <italic>D. genkwa</italic>, induces IFN-&#x003b3; production from NK cells through activation of protein kinase D (PKD), a member of the PKC family (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, our data does not exclude the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules in NK cell activation because NK cells express several TLR molecules on cell and endosomal membranes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). It is assumed that some components derived from vp-genkwa could trigger the activation of TLRs, thereby inducing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and subsequently nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B activation. Therefore, we are currently investigating the role of TLR and downstream molecular networks in the induction of NK cell activation using TLR- and MyD88-deficient mice. However, one incongruous finding is that higher doses of vp-genkwa administered after HSV-1 infection do not increase resistance. It was presumed that excessive triggering of TLR and other innate immune receptors on NK cells could result in a form of innate immunity paralysis characterized by reduced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine release and hypo-activation of NK cells (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>In addition, NK cell activation can enhance the function of dendritic cells (DCs) for tailored adaptive immune responses, since crosstalk between NK cells and DCs plays a role in inducing immune responses to vaccine antigens (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Also, IFN-&#x003b3; produced from activated NK cells may elicit various effects that confer protection against HSV-1 genital infection because IFN-&#x003b3; is important for immune resistance to HSV infection, as well as macrophage activation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3; may promote the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that provide protective immunity against HSV-1 infection (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Therefore, it is speculated that treatment of vp-genkwa at optimal doses after HSV-1 infection fosters an environment conducive to the provision of effective protection against HSV-1 infection via IFN-&#x003b3; production from activated NK cells.</p><p>Acyclovir is a commonly used drug for treating HSV genital and skin infections, but an increasing number of resistant strains have emerged owing to the drug's wide clinical applications. This situation compels us to seek a drug that can act against acyclovir-resistant strain. Because genital inflammation caused by HSV infection is considered an immune response orchestrated by innate and adaptive immune cells, a drug that can enhance innate and adaptive immunity against HSV infection may be a promising candidate for the treatment of genital inflammation. Although the specific molecules activated by vp-genkwa that increase protective immunity were not defined, our data provide a valuable insight into the use of vp-genkwa to control clinical severity in HSV infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant, funded by the Korea Government

The infected mice were then examined daily until 15 dpi for survival (A) and for vaginal inflammation, neurological illness, and death (B). (C and D) Effect of vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection. Groups of BALB/c mice were infected i.vag. with HSV-1 and treated orally with vp-genkwa twice with a 1-day interval. The infected mice were examined daily until 15 dpi to assess survival (C), and vaginal inflammation, neurological illness, and death (D). Kaplan-Meiers survival curves were computed and analyzed using the chi-square test. Clinical severity was graded as follows: 0, no inflammation; 1, mild inflammation; 2, moderate swelling; 3, severe inflammation; 4, paralysis; 5, death.
