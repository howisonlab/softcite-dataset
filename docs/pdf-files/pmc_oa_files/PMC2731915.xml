Here we report that arsenite (As[III]) can induce both replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and homologous recombination (HR) at doses as low as 5 &#x000b5;M (0.65 mg/l), which are within the typical doses often found in drinking water in contaminated areas. We show that the production of DSBs is dependent on active replication and is likely to be the result of conversion of a DNA single-strand break (SSB) into a toxic DSB when encountered by a replication fork. We demonstrate that HR is required for the repair of these breaks and show that a functional HR pathway protects against As[III]-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, BRCA2-deficient cells are sensitive to As[III] and we suggest that As[III] could be exploited as a therapy for HR-deficient tumours such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated breast and ovarian cancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Arsenic is considered to be a significant hazard in our environment and chronic exposure has been linked to skin, lung, urinary bladder, kidney and liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">1&#x02013;6</xref>). The primary route of exposure is via contaminated drinking water. In some areas of the world contaminated water levels can be up to several thousand times the WHO maximum safe level of 0.01 mg/l. In West Bengal, India, the concentration of arsenic in contaminated water ranges from 0.05 to 1.055 mg/l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Arsenic occurs commonly in the earth's crust but rarely in its pure elemental state. It is usually found in the form of highly toxic and unstable sulphides, oxides and arsenates of potassium, sodium or calcium. Once ingested inorganic arsenic is processed through successive oxidative methylation and reduction steps to its trivalent and pentavalent mono- and dimethylated metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The increased cancer risk posed by contaminated water is thought to be due to the presence of inorganic trivalent arsenite (As[III]<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), although later reports have shown that the trivalent methylated metabolites MMA[III] and DMA[III] are just as, if not more, toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Arsenic trioxide has also been used as a chemotherapeutic against certain cancers for example chronic myeloid leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this respect, arsenic resembles several other anti-cancer drugs that as well as being able to treat cancers are also able to induce cancer themselves. A common feature of carcinogenic anti-cancer drugs is that many of them result in DNA damage; a low dose results in mutations and cancer, and a high dose causes toxicity and cell death.</p><p>Many mechanisms have been suggested for the carcinogenic effects of arsenic, including inhibition of the DNA repair enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>), induction of DNA&#x02013;protein adducts and oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>), altered DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), increased cell proliferation through changes in the expression of a number of genes associated with cell growth (such as c-fos, c-jun and EGR-1) as well as cell-cycle arrest [such as GADD153 and GADD45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)], p53 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate in more detail the type of DNA lesions formed by arsenic. We find that doses as low as 5 &#x003bc;M produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that can be repaired when As[III] is removed. We show that As[III] induces homologous recombination (HR), the pathway known to play an important role in repair of the replication associated DSBs. Furthermore, when compared to wild-type, HR-deficient cell lines were more sensitive, exhibited greater numbers of DSBs and underwent increased apoptosis upon As[III] treatment. DSBs were not induced in the absence of replication, suggesting that they result from replication fork collapse. Together these results suggest that HR plays an important role in preventing As[III]-induced tumourigenesis and suggest a potential therapeutic use for As[III] in the treatment of HR-deficient tumours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and treatment conditions</title><p>Sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) (As[III]) &#x0003e;99% purity was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK).

Here we used the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, AA8, to look for As[III]-induced DNA damage. &#x003b3;H2A.X forms foci upon DNA damage and is often taken as a marker of DNA DSBs. We saw that doses as low as 5 &#x003bc;M As[III] could induce &#x003b3;H2A.X foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), while by 50 &#x003bc;M a large increase can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). It is not clear exactly which types of damage induce &#x003b3;H2A.X foci so we used pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to look directly at DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). By conventional ethidium bromide staining DSBs were not detectable until 25&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M As[III] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), however, by Southern analysis, DSBs could be visualized at doses as low as 5 &#x003bc;M (0.65 mg/l), which is less than two orders of magnitude above the WHO safety level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). It is estimated that 50 &#x003bc;M As[III] produces a similar amount of DSBs as a 6 Gy dose of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

Repair occurred between 2 h and 12 h after removal of As[III]. These results indicate that As[III] induces DSBs that are repaired in wild-type cells.</p><p>DSBs are substrates for the DSB-repair machinery, including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). To investigate if HR is triggered by As[III] we looked for Rad51 foci formation. RAD51 is involved in the strand transfer reaction of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and relocates into stable nuclear foci during HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). We saw that 24 h of treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M As[III] could increase the number of cells containing Rad51 foci &#x0223c;3-fold over spontaneous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To test directly whether As[III] can induce HR we used the SPD8 cell line described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Here, a partial duplication of exon 7 of the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (<italic>hprt</italic>) gene that arose spontaneously in SPD8 cells, leads to expression of non-functional HPRT protein and reversion to wild type by homologous recombination can be selected for in HaST media. Colonies formed following selection are therefore indicative of HR. We found a dose-dependent increase in HR in the <italic>hprt</italic> gene when SPD8 cells were treated with As[III] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In this system, following a 24 h treatment with 20 &#x003bc;M As[III] there was a 5-fold induction in HR compared to spontaneous levels.

To test this we investigated the level of As[III]-induced DSBs in the BRCA2-deficient cell line V-C8. BRCA2 is involved in regulating Rad51 mediated HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and thus these cells are HR deficient. Consistent with a role in repair we saw that BRCA2-deficient cells had higher levels of DSBs than BRCA2 complemented (V-C8 B2) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In the V-C8 cells breaks were visible by ethidium bromide staining at 1 &#x003bc;M As[III], 50 fold less As[III] than is needed to produce a similar amount of DSBs in the BRCA2 complemented cells. In addition DSBs were examined 24 h after removal of As[III]. As expected repair had occurred in BRCA2 complemented cells, but in the BRCA2-deficient cells breaks were still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), confirming that HR is responsible for a portion of DSB repair following As[III]-induced damage. The persistence of DSBs can lead to apoptosis; therefore we compared apoptosis in V-C8 and V-C8 B2 cells. Following 24 h treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M As[III], V-C8 cells were undergoing significant levels of apoptosis compared to both untreated and As[III]-treated V-C8 B2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D). Together these data suggest that As[III] induces DNA DSBs, which are repaired by HR in wild-type cells.

HR defective cell lines containing mutations in BRCA2 (V-C8) XRCC2 (irs1) and XRCC3 (irs1SF) were examined for their survival in increasing doses of As[III] relative to parental (V79-4 and AA8) and corrected cell lines (V-C8 B2, irSX2.2 and PXR3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, B and C). BRCA2, XRCC2 and XRCC3-deficient cell lines were all sensitive to As[III]-induced cytotoxicity. A small number of DSBs were repaired even in the V-C8 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). So to determine whether an alternative pathway for DSB repair &#x02013; non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is also involved in repair of As[III]-induced DSBs, we determined the survival of the DNA-PK-deficient cell line (V3.3) in As[III] relative to the parental (AA8) and DNA-PK complemented [V3.3(hYAC)] cell lines. Unlike the HR-deficient cells the DNA-PK-deficient line showed only a small increase in sensitivity to As[III], suggesting that NHEJ has less of a role in repairing DNA DSBs induced by low doses of As[III]. Interestingly there was a difference in sensitivity at higher doses. Taken together these results suggest HR is required for repair of As[III]-induced DNA damage. The specific sensitivity of HR-deficient cell lines to As[III] opens up the possibility that As[III] may have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of HR-deficient tumours.

As[III] has been reported to induce oxidative damage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), which could potentially collapse replication forks. We therefore determined whether or not replication is required for As[III]-induced DSBs. Cells were co-treated with As[III] and the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin and DSBs measured by PFGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Less As[III]-induced DNA DSBs were released on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis when cells were co-treated with aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This suggests that As[III] may act by increasing the number of lesions that collapse replication forks during replication. We looked to see if inhibiting replication during exposure to As[III] could protect from As[III]-induced death. AA8 cells were treated for 16 h with increasing doses of As[III] in the presence or absence of aphidicolin and apoptosis determined by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). As expected higher doses of As[III] induced apoptosis. Treatment with aphidicolin alone also induced apoptosis but this level was not further increased when As[III] was added. In addition, cells were treated in the presence or absence of aphidicolin for 6 h with a concentration of As[III] known to be toxic to wild-type cells. They were then replated as for a colonogenic survival assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). A similar result was found, aphidicolin alone was detrimental to cell survival but addition of arsenic did not cause any further decrease in cell survival. These data together suggest that following exposure to As[III] it is the collapse of replication forks and resultant DSBs which are lethal to cells.

During repair of oxidative base damage SSBs are induced and these can collapse replication forks into DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). As As[III]-induced DSBs were dependent upon DNA replication, we reasoned that As[III] is inducing single strand lesions. To test this we determined whether or not cells lacking the SSB repair pathway were sensitive to As[III]. The EM9 CHO cell line is deficient in XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and thus in SSB repair. Surprisingly, in a colony forming assay with increasing doses of As[III], EM9 cells showed similar cytotoxicity as the parental AA8 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). In addition, we treated cells with As[III] and tested sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Co-treatment with As[III] increased the MMS sensitivity of AA8 but not EM9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). These data together suggest that As[III] also inhibits repair of lesions. It is likely that it is this increase in unrepaired lesions that leads to replication fork collapse and DSB formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The way in which As[III] either directly induces DNA damage and/or modifies repair is predicted to play a major role in the molecular mechanism of As[III]-induced carcinogenicity. The DNA lesions that result following As[III] exposure and the processes by which cells deal with them are therefore of interest. The micromolar concentrations of As[III] used in this study are similar to the average arsenic level in whole blood of individuals exposed to contaminated water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Therefore we believe these experiments replicate the effects that occur in patients exposed to damaging levels of As[III].</p><p>We saw that, relative to wild-type cells, the SSB repair (XRCC1)-deficient EM9 cell line was not sensitive to As[III] and suggest that this is because As[III] itself inhibits single strand break repair. This is supported by the finding that, when co-treated with As[III], wild type but not SSB repair-deficient cells showed increased sensitivity to the alkylating agent MMS. Our data are consistent with previous findings that As[III] inhibits SSB repair to prevent repair of oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). We also demonstrate that DSBs are induced upon expose to As[III], even at low and physiologically relevant doses. The appearance of As[III]-induced DSBs was dependent on replication therefore it is likely that As[III] does not directly induce DSBs. Rather we propose that they arise as a result of unrepaired SSBs at replication forks collapsing into DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>The lack of increase in sensitivity to As[III] in SSB repair-deficient cells was surprising as As[III] is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is reported to induce oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). However, our data do not exclude such damage being induced and are compatible with a model whereby As[III] can both increase damage and inhibit repair. Furthermore, As[III] has also been shown to inhibit nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). It is therefore likely that As[III] targets many aspects of DNA repair adding weight to the hypothesis that As[III] mediated inhibition of DNA damage repair contributes to increased replication fork collapse and thus the DSBs observed.</p><p>DSBs are lethal to cells and like other DSBs collapsed replication forks are a substrate for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). We suggest that due to As[III]-induced inhibition of repair, larger numbers of SSBs persist into S-phase and collapse replication forks forming DSBs, which can be the substrate for homologous recombination. This explains the increase in Rad51 foci and induction of HR seen following As[III] treatment. As replication fork associated DSBs are repaired by HR and mainly produce SCE events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) this model would explain the increased SCE levels in lymphocytes from people exposed to Arsenic contaminated water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).</p><p>We found that cells with a deficiency in HR [irs1, irs1SF and V-C8, deficient in XRCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), XRCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)] were hypersensitive to As[III]-induced damage and could not repair As[III]-induced DSBs, implicating HR in the repair of these lesions. Gene polymorphisms in the HR gene XRCC3 were seen to influence micronuclei (MN) frequency in human peripheral blood lymphocytes of workers exposed to inorganic arsenite compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and the DNA repair capacity was reduced in arsenic exposed individuals developing pre-malignant hyperkeratosis compared to exposed individuals without skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). HR may then be important in protecting against As[III]-induced carcinogenesis and differences in HR capacity in individuals may contribute to their risk following exposure.</p><p>Interestingly arsenic derived compounds have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine to treat cancer and have recently been used to efficiently treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and several solid tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Arsenic trioxide is well tolerated and the adverse reactions can be managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). We have previously shown that PARP inhibitors can be used alone to specifically kill HR-deficient tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), they have also been used to sensitise cells to other DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Here we show that BRCA2-deficient cells are sensitive to As[III]. It is therefore possible that arsenic derived compounds could be used as chemotherapeutic agents either alone or in combination with other agents for this subset of tumours. Arsenite is reported to compete with Zn in binding to the zinc finger of PARP1 in order to inhibit repair of oxidative base damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). It can be predicted than that As[III] prevents PARP from binding to damaged DNA, this is different to other PARP1 inhibitors currently in clinical trials for treatment of BRCA1/2-associated cancer, which are based on NAD analogues and inhibit the enzymatic action of PARP1. Resistance to PARP inhibitors in cell lines appears to occur via intragenic deletion in BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), however other mechanisms of resistance are possible and inhibiting PARP in a different way may provide a second route of treatment.</p><p>Only at concentrations greater than 20 &#x003bc;M did DNA-PK-deficient cells become sensitive to As[III], suggesting that at higher doses As[III]-induced damage is repaired by the error prone process of non-homologous end joining. This could then explain the increased level of chromosomal aberrations seen in As[III] exposed individuals. Indeed some reports suggest that the level of chromosomal damage in exposed individuals can be used to predict future risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we find that As[III] causes replication-dependent repairable DSBs (probably as a result of decreased single strand break repair) and that the HR machinery is activated. HR-deficient cells are highly sensitive to As[III]-induced lesions suggesting that HR is an important pathway for error-free repair of As[III]-induced damage. We suggest that the HR repair pathway is important in preventing As[III]-induced DNA lesions from causing gene rearrangements or mutations that may inactivate tumour suppressor genes or activate proto-oncogenes and thereby cause cancer. In addition, we suggest that arsenic-based therapy may be an efficient way to kill HR-deficient cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Yorkshire Cancer Research.
