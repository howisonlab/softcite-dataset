It hydrolyses starch and is used commercially for the production of sugar syrups from starch which consist of glucose, maltose, and higher oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Amylases are of great significance in biotechnological applications ranging from food, fermentation, detergent, pharmaceutical, brewing and textile to paper industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). To meet the higher demands of these industries, low cost production of amylase is required.</p><p>Amylase is produced in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. However, due to efficient production strategies, microorganisms have substantial potential to contribute to a number of industrial applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Such industrially important microorganisms are found within the <italic>Bacillus</italic> species because of their rapid growth rates that lead to short fermentation cycles, their capacity to secrete proteins into extra cellular medium, and general handling safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Production of these &#x003b1; amylases has been investigated through submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). However, the contents of a synthetic medium are very expensive and uneconomical, so they need to be replaced with more economically available agricultural and industrial by-products, as they are considered to be good substrates for SSF to produce enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In recent years the technique of solid-state fermentation (SSF) process has been developed and used more extensively. It has advantages over SmF like simple technique, low capital investment, cheaper production of enzyme having better physiochemical properties, lower levels of catabolite repression and better product recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The major factors that affect microbial synthesis of enzymes in a SSF system include selection of a suitable substrate and microorganism, particle size of the substrate, inoculum concentration and moisture level of the substrate. Thus it involves the screening of a number of agro-industrial materials for microbial growth and product formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Temperature and pH are known to be important parameters in the production of enzymes from bacteria; hence, the thermal and the pH stability of the enzyme, which is a function of the exposure time, must also be taken into account.</p><p>The present work represents an investigation into amylase production by SSF with Wheat bran, Gram husk, Rice Bran and Mustard Oilseed cake as substrates and the determination of optimized production conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of Bacteria</title><p>About 50 strains were isolated from soil samples collected from various sites at Delhi and NCR, India. These strains were characterized by colony morphologically, shape and gram character; and maintained in 50% glycerol stock at -20&#x000b0;C till further use.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening of bacterial isolates</title><p>Primary screening of bacterial isolates for production of alpha amylase was done by the starch agar plate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Out of 50 strains, the 3 strains that showed the biggest zone of clearance in starch hydrolysis were selected for production in Solid State Fermentation.</p><p><bold>Inoculum preparation:</bold> The selected bacterial strains were inoculated in nutrient broth [consisting of (g L<sup>-1</sup>): peptone, 5; Beef extract, 3; NaCl, 5] followed by incubation at 37&#x000ba;C for 24 h to get a standardized inoculum (0.5 OD at 600nm with 3.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml)</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Substrate</title><p>Four different types of agro-industrial wastes to be used as substrate viz., Wheat bran, Gram husk, Rice Bran and Mustard Oilseed cake were procured from local market of Delhi and powdered obtain a particle size of 1.0 to 2.0 mm. SSF was performed with all the four substrates and their enzyme production was checked by assay.</p><sec><title>SSF Technique</title><p>Experiments were conducted in 100ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 5g of the substrate impregnated with 10ml of sterile liquid nutrient medium containing(%): [KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> - 0.1, NaCl- 0.25, MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O- 0.01, CaCl<sub>2</sub>- 0.01]. The flasks were autoclaved and inoculated with 1ml of the prepared inoculum, thoroughly mixed and followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 days. Samples were aseptically withdrawn periodically and assayed for amylase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme assay</title><p>Estimation of amylase activity was carried out according to the DNSA (3, 5 dinitro salicylic acid) method. One ml of 1% starch was incubated with different dilutions of the enzyme extract and 1ml of citrate- phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The reaction mixture was incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2ml of DNS and kept in boiling water bath for 10min. The absorbance was read at 540nm using a Spectrophotometre (Shimadzu, Thermoelectric cell holder,S-1700), against glucose as the standard. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme, which releases 1&#x003bc;mole of reducing sugar as glucose per minute, under the assay conditions (U/ml/min). The experiments were carried out in triplicates and standard error was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimization studies for enzyme production</title><p>In a sequential order, the various physicochemical factors as substrate, moisture content and inoculum size affecting the enzyme production were optimized for maximal enzyme production by using the solid substrate for which best amylase activity was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate</title><p>The enzyme production was studied with all the four types of agro-industrial wastes viz., Wheat bran, Gram husk, Rice Bran and Mustard Oilseed cake.</p></sec><sec><title>Moisture</title><p>Moisture content for the solid state fermentation of the enzyme was evaluated by varying the moisture content from 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5.</p></sec><sec><title>Inoculum Size</title><p>The enzyme production was checked by varying the inoculum size at 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% of bacterial culture with colony count at 3.5x10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial purification of enzyme</title><p>Partially purified enzyme was obtained by addition of solid (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to the crude enzyme obtained after solid state fermentation, with constant stirring at room temperature.

This precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. This dialysate was used as the enzyme solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of factors affecting enzyme activity</title><p>Various process parameters as temperature and pH affecting enzyme activity were optimized.

From the industrial viewpoint it is necessary to have a strain that can produce large quantity of the enzyme in short fermentation time. Our strain produced very high amount of amylase, about 5400 U/ g in only 72 h which is much higher than that reported by other researchers in SSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>)</p><p>Moisture content is a critical factor for SSF processes because this variable has influence on growth and biosynthesis and secretion of different metabolites. Lower moisture content causes reduction in solubility of the nutrients of the substrate, low degree of swelling and high water tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). On the other hand, higher moisture levels can cause a reduction in enzyme yield due to steric hindrance of the growth of strain by reduction in porosity (interparticle spaces) of the solid substrate, thus interfering with oxygen transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The moisture levels in SSF processes vary between 30 and 85% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The optimum moisture content for growth and substrate utilization depends on the organism and the substrate used for cultivation. In this study the optimum moisture content for the enzyme production was found to be 33%.</p><p>Inoculum size is an important factor for the production of enzyme. Lower inoculum level results in a lower number of cells in the production medium. This requires a longer time to grow to an optimum number to utilize the substrate and form the desired product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The best inoculum size in our study was 20%.Bayasl et al (2008) have also reported 20% inoculum size as optimum in SSF of wheat bran in amylase production, though Anto et al. (2006), have reported that increase in inoculum size adversely affected the enzyme production.</p><p>It is evident from this study that oilseed cakes may serve as ideal fermentation bases for obtaining high yields of amylase from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. Mustard oilseed cake contains a lower level of proteinaceous matter and a higher level of carbohydrate than all the other substrates used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), thus is a suitable nutrient source by itself for amylase production. However, Ikram-ul-Haq et al. (2003) have reported wheat bran as the best substrate for &#x003b1;-amylase production by <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> using different agricultural by-products.</p><p>Amylases are known to be active in a wide range of temperature (40&#x02013;90&#x000b0;C) and pH (4&#x02013;11). The optimum temperature of this amylase was 50&#x000ba;C, which is similar to that described for other <italic>Bacillus</italic> amylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This identifies the unique characteristic of this <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp that grows at 37&#x000b0;C as a mesophile, but the enzyme it produces is active and stable at high temperatures (50&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C). Similar finding has been reported by Hagihara et al. (2006). The stability of the enzyme was found to be independent of divalent calcium ions. The enzyme stability trend, as reported in the present study, agrees with the behavior of amylases from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. investigated by Cordeiro et al. (2002). Thermal stabilization of the enzyme in the presence of calcium has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>The pH optima of the enzyme was found to be 6 with stability in range 5&#x02013;7. Amylases are active and stable over a wide range of pH (3.5&#x02013;12), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), though some are only stable within a narrow pH range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>The enzyme activity was found to be enhanced by lower concentrations of calcium, cobalt, magnesium and sodium ions. Similar findings have been reported by Ajayi and Fagade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), However their reports of NaCl being less effective for enzyme activity contradicts our study where NaCl has been found to enhance the activity, equally.</p><p>The unique capability of amylase to retain about 80 % enzyme activity at 70 &#x000b0;C compared to the optimum at 50&#x000b0;C makes it useful for various industrial applications like starch liquefaction at increased temperature as starch liquefaction is carried out at higher temperatures of 70&#x02013;90 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).
