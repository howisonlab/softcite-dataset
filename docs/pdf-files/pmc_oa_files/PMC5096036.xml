The evaluation of stained FNA smears leads to a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis in the majority of cases. However, 10% to 40% of FNAs are classified as cytologically indeterminate according to the Bethesda reporting system.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Indeterminate classification includes 3 categories: atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) (Bethesda category III), follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) (Bethesda category IV), and suspicious for malignancy (SM) (Bethesda category V). The majority of patients with indeterminate cytology are referred to surgery regardless of their risk of malignancy, which is 5% to 15%, 15% to 30%, and 60% to 75% for Bethesda categories III, IV, and V, respectively.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Therefore, improving diagnostic accuracy for patients with indeterminate cytology would benefit many of these patients, reducing the rates of surgery and the subsequent risk for metabolic and anatomic complications (such as hypoparathyroidism and laryngeal nerve injury), as well as the resulting life&#x02010;long requirement of thyroid hormone supplementation.</p><p>To overcome the diagnostic limitations of FNA cytology and to spare patients with benign nodules unnecessary surgeries, several molecular tests have been developed. Some of these tests use gene point mutations (eg, <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic>) and gene rearrangements (eg, <italic>RET</italic>/<italic>PTC</italic>, <italic>PAX8</italic>/<italic>PPARG</italic>) associated with thyroid cancer.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Another test uses the expression profiles of 167 genes to classify indeterminate nodules.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> More recently, a molecular test combining DNA, messenger RNA and microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers was developed for the diagnosis of nodules classified as Bethesda categories III and IV.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> A major disadvantage of these tests is that they all require fresh FNA tissue or special collection and shipment conditions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a molecular test that can diagnose indeterminate thyroid nodules using stained FNA smears prepared for initial cytopathologic evaluation. In this test, expression levels of a set of miRNA biomarkers are measured and used for classification of thyroid nodules as benign or suspicious.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> miRNAs are an important class of noncoding RNA implicated in gene expression regulation, and their expression profiles have been associated with the pathophysiology of cancer, including thyroid cancer.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> It has been demonstrated that miRNA expression profiles can differentiate between malignant and benign thyroid lesions in resected nodules as well as FNA samples.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> miRNAs have also been shown to be extremely stable and remain intact in various clinical samples.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> This, as well as their important role in thyroid cancer, makes miRNAs excellent biomarkers for the diagnosis of indeterminate thyroid nodules.</p><p>Air&#x02010;dried Romanowsky&#x02010;type (eg, Giemsa, Diff&#x02010;Quik) stained slides are commonly used for the evaluation of cytoplasm or extracellular material; and alcohol&#x02010;fixed, Papanicolaou&#x02010;stained slides are used for the optimal assessment of nuclear details.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> The test was developed and validated on FNA smears that were stained with both of these stain types.</p><p>Test performance was determined in a previously completed, multinational and multicenter, blinded validation study.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In the current study, the test's robustness and compatibility with a variety of FNA smear processing and staining techniques were demonstrated. The ability of the assay to work on minute amounts of thyroid cells originating in a single FNA smear slide was tested, no effect on correct classification rates was found. Finally, the test was able to yield accurate results in the presence of blood in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="cncy21731-sec-0006"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="cncy21731-sec-0007"><title>Patients and Samples</title><p>De&#x02010;identified, retrospective FNA smear samples with corresponding histologic diagnoses from 576 nodules were obtained for the assay's training and clinical validation studies and were profiled as previously described.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> A single slide from each nodule was used for the assay training and clinical validation studies. The analytical validation utilized these as well as additional slides from the above&#x02010;mentioned nodules (for a description of all slides used in this study, see Table <xref rid="cncy21731-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). Whole blood was collected from 17 de&#x02010;identified donors and was used to create 48 nonstained blood smear slides (10 &#x003bc;L per slide). To study the effect of the time to processing on miRNA expression, 5 additional Bethesda II thyroid FNAs were cut in half; 1 half of each slide was immediately extracted and assayed, and the other half was stored at room temperature for 54 days and then extracted and assayed. The samples used in this study were collected under approval of the Institutional Review Board Committee, and a waiver of consent was obtained from the Institutional Review Board.</p><table-wrap id="cncy21731-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Analytical Validation Studies and Samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Section</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Objective</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of Samples</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assay concordance on slides taken from the same nodule</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assay protocol was run on 139 samples taken from 59 FNA passes on 49 nodules;

Two negative controls were used: One was processed starting at the RNA extraction stage, and the other was processed from the complimentary DNA (cDNA) synthesis stage. These negative controls ensured that samples were not contaminated during either of these stages.</p><p>The assay's positive control consisted of a mix of RNAs extracted from several benign and malignant samples of thyroid formalin&#x02010;fixed, paraffin&#x02010;embedded (FFPE) resections, which were augmented with RNA extracted from whole blood to ensure detectable expression levels of all miRNAs measured by the assay. FFPE samples were used as positive controls to ensure high expression levels of all 24 assay miRNAs in these samples. In addition, resection tissue provides a high miRNA yield, facilitating use of the same positive control sample for extended periods of time. A positive control sample was run alongside each batch of clinical samples to ensure that the cDNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents yielded consistent results. Each sample was profiled in duplicate.

At 5 ng of initial RNA material, assay QC failed in only three of 12 samples, whereas 1 sample or none failed QC criteria for amounts of 10, 20, and 40 ng. Based on discovery studies (data not shown), we observed that the majority of FNA slides contained at least 20 ng of RNA; therefore, 20 ng was set as the default RNA amount for processing in the assay protocol. Since assay classification was consistent in all tested initial RNA amounts (see below and Table <xref rid="cncy21731-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>), it was concluded that slides with &#x0003c;20 ng initial RNA could also be processed by the assay. Within the assay's consecutive clinical validation set, only 11 of 201 slides had &#x0003c;20 ng of RNA, and only one of those 11 slides failed because of insufficient thyroid material (2 ng). The rate of QC failure for samples with &#x0003c;20 ng in the clinical validation was 9%, whereas the overall failure rate for all samples was 6%.</p><table-wrap id="cncy21731-tbl-0002" xml:lang="en"

Three laboratory&#x02010;to&#x02010;laboratory concordance studies were run on a total of 168 samples (Table <xref rid="cncy21731-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>, sections 6A&#x02010;6C).</p><p>The first study assessed concordance of the entire process on 27 FNA and FNA&#x02010;like samples. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT&#x02010;PCR quantification were performed in each laboratory according to the assay protocol, and samples were classified by the assay. Twenty&#x02010;five samples passed assay QC; and, of these, 24 received an identical classification in both laboratories, resulting in 96% concordance and a Pearson correlation of 0.90 for assay miRNA expression (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001).</p><p>In the second study, concordance of cDNA preparation followed by qRT&#x02010;PCR was tested for 93 samples, representing 7 histologic types: follicular carcinoma, follicular adenoma, Hashimoto thyroiditis, medullary carcinoma, nodular hyperplasia (nodular goiter), papillary carcinoma, and Graves disease. In this study, RNA was extracted in the RG&#x02010;IL laboratory, and subsequent steps were performed independently in both laboratories (RG&#x02010;IL and RGL&#x02010;US).</p><p>Eleven samples failed assay QC. Of the remaining 82 samples, 76 received the same classification in the 2 laboratories, representing 92.68% agreement. A minimal Pearson correlation of 0.974 over all assay miRNAs was observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) after removing 1 sample from analysis based on a single outlier miRNA.</p><p>In the third study, the concordance of qRT&#x02010;PCR between RG&#x02010;IL and RGL&#x02010;US was tested on 48 cDNA samples, representing 6 histologic types: follicular carcinoma, follicular adenoma, Hashimoto thyroiditis, medullary carcinoma, nodular hyperplasia (nodular goiter), and papillary carcinoma. Classification of 40 of the 44 samples that passed assay QC was identical between laboratories (90.9% agreement). The minimal Pearson correlation for assay miRNAs in these 48 samples was 0.95 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Because the current study was performed at a time when the laboratory technicians were at the beginning of their qRT&#x02010;PCR training, this level of concordance may be an underestimation of qRT&#x02010;PCR concordance. That possibility is supported by the high concordance measured in the entire assay process study, despite the greater number of factors in the entire process study relative to this study.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="cncy21731-sec-0023"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Diagnosis of thyroid nodules as benign or malignant is an important and challenging task. Molecular diagnostic tests have been in use to aid this diagnostic challenge, but they require non&#x02010;routine collection or shipment procedures. In the current study, we tested over 200 clinical FNA samples to examine the technical characteristics of RosettaGX Reveal&#x02122;, a molecular test that works on routinely used, stained thyroid FNA smears, and its ability to process such samples and return accurate diagnostic results. We demonstrated that the assay is able to work with various routinely used stains, even in particularly challenging cases, such as when minute amounts of RNA are present or when only blood is present, using appropriate QC measures.</p><p>Analytical validation studies establishing the robustness of a diagnostic test over a variety of technical conditions are of utmost importance. In a previous study, we demonstrated the clinical validity of the assay.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In the current study, we demonstrated robustness of the assay for all stages of sample processing, beginning with different types of routinely stained FNA slides, through handling conditions, and ending with laboratory processing and assay classification. We have shown that assay results are not affected by various physical processing conditions, including laboratories, reagents, technicians, time to processing, and PCR instruments. We have also shown that the assay is stable across multiple samples taken from the same FNA pass, regardless of staining method.</p><p>Throughout the analytical validation of the assay, we aimed to achieve a high level of certainty regarding the reproducibility and stability of assay results. To this end, we processed a total of 168 FNA samples for inter&#x02010;laboratory validation. This validation study demonstrated high concordance between slide halves processed from start to finish in the research and development laboratory and slide halves run from start to finish in the CLIA approved CL laboratory (classification agreement was 96% between laboratories). The assay also exhibited high stability for samples that were extracted in 1 laboratory and processed in both laboratories and between samples for which qRT&#x02010;PCR was run in 2 laboratories after extraction and cDNA synthesis was run in a single laboratory (classification agreement, 92.68% and 90.9%, respectively). These results demonstrate a high level of reproducibility.</p><p>The assay was designed to diagnose FNA smear slides and does not require an additional needle pass or special transport tube. Any representative stained slide from an FNA pass can be used for assay classification. The use of an existing slide for molecular testing has the additional advantage of running the assay on the same slide that was evaluated by the referring cytopathologist. This ensures that the assay's results correspond to the relevant thyroid material in question. Use of the same slide for cytologic evaluation (cell composition and quantity) and assay processing further substantiates the analytical results pertaining to slide characteristics observed in this study.</p><p>The FNAs used in this study and in the assay's clinical validation set were comprised of approximately 98% to 99% blood and approximately 1% to 2% thyroid cells. A major issue when working with FNAs is the small amount of diagnostic material. In this study, we have demonstrated that the assay gives correct classifications for FNAs with minute amounts of thyroid material. A designated experiment was conducted on 12 thyroid samples using different initial RNA amounts. MiRNA signals exhibited linearity across the RNA quantity range, and classification consistency was also similar for all RNA amounts. We have also demonstrated that, when the assay was run on samples that were adequate for diagnosis, the QC failure rate was very low (6%).<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> These data suggest that the assay is suitable for the clinical setting, with low failure rates and the ability to work with extremely low RNA amounts while maintaining high accuracy.</p><p>Other molecular tests have been shown to mistakenly diagnose whole blood samples as suspicious for malignancy or as benign.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Although the assay described in the current report can correctly classify samples with low numbers of thyroid cells, it does not mistakenly diagnose samples that do not contain any thyroid material.</p><p>The samples used for clinical validation of the assay were FNA slides stored at room temperature that ranged in age from a few months to approximately 11 years. To determine whether the time to processing was a factor in the correctness of assay classification, we compared older slides to more recently prepared slides and observed no significant difference in assay performance. These results align with published data regarding the stability of miRNAs in clinical samples.<xref rid="cncy21731-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>
</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated the stability of the RosettaGX Reveal assay to conditions often encountered during clinical sample processing. We have also demonstrated that the assay is robust to the qualities and characteristics of samples used in assay development and validation. The use of a validated diagnostic assay that works with routinely used thyroid FNA smears can aid physicians in diagnostic decisions pertaining to course of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="cncy21731-sec-0024"><title>FUNDING SUPPORT</title><p>No specific funding was disclosed.</p></sec><sec id="cncy21731-sec-0025"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES</title><p>This work is the fruit of an extensive collaboration between Rosetta Genomics, a biotechnology company with an expertise in microRNA technologies, and academic counterparts at leading clinical centers.
