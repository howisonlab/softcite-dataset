Brefeldin A (BFA), a known inhibitor of the Arf1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) interaction, is highly cytotoxic. Therefore, interaction of Arf1 with ArfGEF is an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development because of their poor bioavailability. Here, we aimed to identify novel inhibitors of the Arf1-ArfGEF interaction that display potent antitumor activity <italic>in vivo</italic> but with a chemical structure distinct from that of BFA. We exploited a panel of 39 cell lines (termed JFCR39) coupled with a drug sensitivity data base and COMPARE algorithm, resulting in the identification of a possible novel Arf1-ArfGEF inhibitor AMF-26, which differed structurally from BFA. By using a pulldown assay with GGA3-conjugated beads, we demonstrated that AMF-26 inhibited Arf1 activation. Subsequently, AMF-26 induced Golgi disruption, apoptosis, and cell growth inhibition. Computer modeling/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested that AMF-26 bound to the contact surface of the Arf1-Sec7 domain where BFA bound. AMF-26 affected membrane traffic, including the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi networks, and the endosomal systems. Furthermore, using AMF-26 and its derivatives, we demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between cell growth inhibition and Golgi disruption. In addition, orally administrated AMF-26 (83 mg/kg of body weight; 5 days) induced complete regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that AMF-26 is a novel anticancer drug candidate that inhibits the Golgi system, targeting Arf1 activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anticancer Drug</kwd><kwd>ARF</kwd><kwd>Bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Cancer Therapy</kwd><kwd>Cell Biology</kwd><kwd>Drug Discovery</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF)</kwd><kwd>Molecular Pharmacology</kwd><kwd>Signal Transduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> play an important role in many biological processes, such as growth, cell survival, and intercellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Therefore, inhibitors of specific PPIs can act as novel therapeutic agents including anticancer drugs. Indeed, several small molecule-PPI inhibitors have been developed, such as Nutlin-3 for HDM2-p53 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Nonetheless, the number of promising PPI inhibitors for cancer treatment remains limited.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) by its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Arfs are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that play a major role in mediating vesicular transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The cellular activity of Arfs is stimulated by the Sec7 domain of GEFs that promote the exchange of inactive GDP-bound forms to active GTP-bound forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Arf1, the best characterized Arf, localizes primarily to the Golgi apparatus and regulates both anterograde and retrograde vesicular traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The first identified small molecule PPI that targets the interaction between Arf-ArfGEF was brefeldin A (BFA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), a lactone isolated from fungi, which inhibits the activation of Arf1 by a subset of its GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Treatment of BFA causes rapid but reversible disruption of the Golgi apparatus leading to the vesiculation of the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Furthermore, BFA showed tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, inhibitors of Arf1-ArfGEF interaction are valuable tools for studying membrane traffic as well as anticancer drug candidates. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>We previously established a panel of 39 cell lines (termed JFCR39) coupled with our own drug sensitivity data base, which is comparable with that of the NCI60 panel from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Using the COMPARE computer algorithm (details described under &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;), it is possible to correlate the growth inhibitory patterns of JFCR39 (termed &#x0201c;fingerprints&#x0201d;) of a test compound with those of known anticancer drugs and inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Here, we have attempted to identify new Arf1-ArfGEF inhibitors with equivalent functions to BFA but with a different chemical structure, by using COMPARE-guided <italic>in silico</italic> screening instead of structure-based screening.</p><p>This approach enabled us to discover a novel small molecule AMF-26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), an octahydronaphthalene derivative, which disrupts the Golgi system probably by inhibiting the Arf1 activation. AMF-26 shows strong growth inhibition against JFCR39 cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, it showed potent antitumor activity against xenografts of the human breast cancer cell line BSY-1 via oral administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>AMF-26 ((2<italic>E</italic>,4<italic>E</italic>)-5-((1<italic>S</italic>,2<italic>S</italic>,4a<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>,7<italic>S</italic>,8<italic>S</italic>,8a<italic>S</italic>)-7-hydroxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-2-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(pyridin-3-yl-methyl)penta-2,4-dienamide) and its derivatives were synthesized from AMF-14, a natural product from the genus <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, and kindly provided by the Research Laboratories Kyoto, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.

Band intensity was determined using the program ImageJ (National Institute of Health).</p><p>To confirm the inhibitory efficacy of Arf1 activation, HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells were used to measure exogenous Arf1-GTP. Using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, HEK293T cells were transfected with the Arf1-HA expression vector, prepared as described under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.316125/DC1">supplemental &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d;</ext-link> For transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/10 ml in a 10-cm plate. The transfectants were then incubated for 24 h, and subsequently treated with chemicals for 1 h. The cell lysates were assayed as described above. Because of a difference in molecular weight, the exogenous band of Arf1-HA can be differentiated from the endogenous band of intact Arf1. In HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells, the expression of intact Arf1 was very low. Therefore, the intensity of the band corresponding to Arf1 was apparently weaker than that of the exogenous Arf1-HA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conformational Sampling of AMF-26</title><p>Conformational analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 (PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sampling (CAMDAS) 2.1 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x0212b;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of &#x000b1;30&#x000b0;. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain Complex</title><p>To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1r8q">1r8q</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) using the parallel version of the SUPERPOSE program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by CAMDAS. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogen-bond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 &#x0212b;) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total).

Seed compounds with desirable pharmacological activities can be used to extract candidates with a similar mode of action in the data base by COMPARE analysis. The data base of our cell line panel holds information on 4,000 compounds, including anticancer drugs and known inhibitors of various biological pathways. Employing this protocol, JFCR39 has been successful in identifying several new anticancer agents, such as a new telomerase inhibitor (FJ5002) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), an inhibitor of topoisomerase I and II (MS-247) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and a novel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (ZSTK474) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). For instance, the novel PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 was structurally different from the known PI3K inhibitor LY294002, although their respective fingerprints were similar. We therefore reasoned that COMPARE analysis would be a suitable method for screening structurally diverse compounds to identify those with a similar mode of action to BFA.</p><p>When BFA was used as a seed in COMPARE analysis, AMF-26 was identified to be the compound with a highest correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.831) in the data base based on the fingerprint profile.

Therefore, we first examined whether AMF-26 induces Golgi disassembly by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody to Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). GBF1 is localized to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi apparatus and plays a role in vesicular trafficking by activating Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In control cells, GBF1 was observed in the perinuclear region, forming a ribbon-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, addition of BFA caused a rapid release of GBF1 into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). These results were in agreement with previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). When the cells were treated with AMF-26, GBF1 was observed to be dispersed from the perinuclear region throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), which indicated that AMF-26 disrupted the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, this observation was confirmed by live imaging using the MDA-MB-435 stably expressing GFP-conjugated clathrin light chain a (CLCa) cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.316125/DC1">supplemental Video S1, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></ext-link>).

Disruption of the Golgi apparatus was concurrent with the disappearance of GFP-CLCa signals suggesting that CLCa was affected by AMF-26. Next, we examined whether the AMF-26-induced disruption of Golgi was a reversible process. The normal Golgi structure reappeared in the perinuclear area 4 h after washout of drugs with drug-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>), which indicated that the effect of AMF-26 against Golgi was fully reversible like that of BFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>AMF-26 disrupts Golgi apparatus in BSY-1 cells.</bold>

The hydrophobic interactions correspond to the matching of hydrophobic property spheres (HP1 and HP2) by SUPERPOSE. The positively charged Arg-19 of Arf1 interacted with the hydroxyl oxygen of AMF-26 and the carbonyl oxygen of BFA. This electrostatic interaction accounted for the matching of hydrogen-bond acceptors (DA1 of AMF-26 and HA1 of BFA). In addition, the hydroxyl group of AMF-26 hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Thr-64 of Arf1. Instead of the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl oxygen of the lactone ring of BFA and the amide nitrogen of Asp-67 of Arf1, the amide oxygen of AMF-26 hydrogen-bonded with the main chain of Glu-54 of Arf1.

AMF-26 is thought to induce Golgi disruption via the inhibition of Arf1 activation. The Golgi disrupting activity of AMF-26 was significantly correlated with its growth-inhibiting activity. Finally, our results showed that oral administration of AMF-26 induced the regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts.</p><p>The Arf family of small GTPases plays a major role in maintaining Golgi structure and driving Golgi membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It is known that the BFA-sensitive large ArfGEFs, such as GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, are predominantly localized to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and TGN. After activation by GBF1, Arf1 mediates COPI coat recruitment and enables vesicle transport between Golgi and ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). On the other hand, when activated by BIG1 or BIG2, Arf1 recruits adapter proteins, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), and Golgi-associated &#x003b3;-adaptin ear-containing Arf-binding proteins, GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). These Arf1-effector molecules mediate transport between TGN and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). BFA inactivates Arf1 by inhibiting PPIs between Arf1 and Arf1GEFs, and subsequently induces the disruption of <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and TGN, or affects the endosomal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Furthermore, BFA showed tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). From the viewpoint of developing molecular-targeted drugs, BFA is attractive because its target, Arf1 and ArfGEF interaction, is unique. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Here we used COMPARE analysis to screen for compounds showing a BFA-like fingerprint, and identified AMF-26. BFA has a lactone ring, whereas AMF-26 has an octahydronaphthalene ring with a side chain including a pyridine moiety. Although the chemical structure of AMF-26 is distinct from that of BFA, we verified that the two compounds share a similar molecular mode of action as expected from the COMPARE analysis. Moreover, computer modeling/MD simulation and biological validations suggested that AMF-26 inhibited the interaction between Arf1 and BFA-sensitive large ArfGEFs. AMF-26 induced the disruption of <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and TGN at almost the same concentrations as BFA, and inhibited recycling of transferrin. These results indicate that AMF-26 is a novel inhibitor of Arf1 activation whose chemical structure is different from BFA.</p><p>Several other Golgi disruptors related to Arf activation have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). These compounds showed inhibition of membrane traffic. However, their precise modes of action appear to be different from that of AMF-26 and BFA. Moreover, compared with AMF-26 or BFA, these compounds resulted in much weaker inhibition of cell growth.</p><p>It remains uncertain whether cell growth inhibition by BFA arises from Golgi disruption. Citterio <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) indicated that decreased expression of GBF1, BIG1, or BIG2 by siRNA caused dispersion of the Golgi-localized protein and the inhibition of cell growth. We observed similar results in BSY-1 cells in our preliminary data.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, Pan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) reported that AG1478 showed a weak loss of cell viability. In the present study, we demonstrated that AMF-26 inhibited both Arf1 activation and tumor cell growth in BSY-1 cells. Moreover, AMF-26 and its derivatives showed a positive correlation between the Golgi-disrupting activity and the cell growth-inhibiting activity. We also found a positive correlation between the two when six other cancer cell lines were treated with AMF-26. In our preliminary experiments, inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway or Ras-MAPK pathway was not observed by exposure of cells to AMF-26 for 10 min (data not shown). Collectively, our results suggested a causal relationship between Golgi disruption and cell growth inhibition by AMF-26. Furthermore, in the present study, we found that AMF-26 induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Our observations agree with the report of Citterio <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) indicating that decreased expression of GBF1 causes apoptosis.</p><p>A previous study described the antitumor activity of BFA in early stage mouse subcutaneous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the course of these studies, BFA was injected intraperitoneally twice a day. Frequent administration was necessary because the clearance of BFA is rapid (less than 20 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), consistent with the observation that this compound is a substrate of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that oral administration of AMF-26 once a day induced almost complete regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts in nude mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the oral administration of an inhibitor targeting Arf1 activation that elicits strong antitumor activity without severe body weight loss. Further study on the pharmacokinetic profile of AMF-26 remains to be performed.</p><p>Very recently, AMF-26 was identified as an angiogenesis inhibitor by Watari <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), who revealed that inhibition of VEGF receptor phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling was involved in antiangiogenic activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Therefore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> antitumor activity of AMF-26 shown in the present study may have partly resulted from its antiangiogenic activity in addition to its direct tumor growth inhibition.</p><p>The COMPARE analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to identify small-molecule enzyme inhibitors, for example, telomerase inhibitor (FJ-5002) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), a topoisomerase I and II inhibitor (MS-247) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and PI3K inhibitor (ZSTK474) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In this study, we exploited the COMPARE analysis to screen BFA-like small molecule inhibitors. Using this approach, we identified AMF-26 as a novel inhibitor of Arf1 activation, despite the fact that its chemical structure does not resemble that of BFA. From these results, the screening of chemicals guided by COMPARE analysis appears to be useful for the discovery of novel drug candidates targeting various biological functions including the Golgi system.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel Golgi disruptor targeting Arf1 activation, AMF-26, and showed that it induced complete regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts. These data suggest that AMF-26 is a novel drug candidate for cancer treatment targeting Arf1 activation.</p></sec>
