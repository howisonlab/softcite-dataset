The acidic environment inhibits the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and promotes tumor cell invasion. In the present study, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were conducted to investigate how NaHCO<sub>3</sub> would affect the antitumor activities of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. For the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, HepG2 cells were cultured at pH 6.5 and 7.4 in the presence of CIK cells or CIK cell-conditioned medium (CM<sub>CIK</sub>). For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, nude mice were xenografted with HepG2-luc cells and divided into four groups: i) CIK cells injection plus NaHCO<sub>3</sub> feeding; ii) CIK cells injection plus drinking water feeding; iii) normal saline injection plus NaHCO<sub>3</sub> feeding; and iv) normal saline injection plus drinking water feeding. The results indicated that the viability and growth rate of HepG2 cells were remarkably suppressed when co-cultured with CIK cells or CM<sub>CIK</sub> at pH 7.4 compared with those of HepG2 cells cultured under the same conditions but at pH 6.5. In the xenograft study, a marked synergistic antitumor effect of the combined therapy was observed. NaHCO<sub>3</sub> feeding augmented the infiltration of cluster of differentiation 3-positive T lymphocytes into the tumor mass. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the antitumor activities of CIK cells against HepG2 cells were negatively affected by the acidic environment inside the tumors, and neutralizing the pH (for example, via NaHCO<sub>3</sub> administration), could therefore reduce or eliminate this influence. In addition, it should be recommended that oncologists routinely prescribe soda water to their patients, particularly during CIK cell therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NaHCO<sub>3</sub></kwd><kwd>cytokine-induced killer cells</kwd><kwd>HepG2</kwd><kwd>extracellular pH</kwd><kwd>acidic microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent primary tumor of the liver, is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Regarding treatment options for HCC, immunotherapy remains an important adjuvant treatment, despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy is currently one of the most commonly used immunotherapies (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In order to improve the efficacy of CIK cell therapy, numerous strategies, including gene transfection (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), stimulation with certain growth factors (<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), pretreatment with antitumor drugs (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), or combination with genetically modified dendritic cells (<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), have been attempted in practice. However, a number of clinical trials of CIK cell therapies failed to demonstrate any noticeable improvement over other therapeutic regimens, neither in terms of HCC control rates nor long-term survival rates (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), suggesting that other factors, such as the environment where CIK cells are functioning, should also be considered for immunotherapies.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the high metabolic demand of rapidly proliferating cancer cells, in conjunction with a shift toward glycolytic metabolism reflecting both tumor hypoxia and oncogene-induced changes in gene expression, leads to an often greatly increased production and extrusion of acid by cancer cells (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, the extracellular pH (pHe) of malignant solid tumors is usually acidic, ranging from 6.5 to 6.9, whereas the pHe of normal tissues is significantly more alkaline, ranging from 7.2 to 7.5 (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This disturbance of the acid-base balance is able to remodel various physiological functions, and results in solid tumors becoming more invasive and metastatic (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition, it may also induce undesired resistance to immunotherapy (<xref rid="b13-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). By contrast, inhibition of the acid extrusion of tumor cells may alleviate their resistance to immunotherapy (<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, none of these speculations has ever been confirmed for CIK cell immunotherapy <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the present study, the antitumor activities of CIK cells against HepG2 cells were evaluated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> under environments with acidic and alkaline pH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or HepG2-luc cells (HepG2 cells stably transfected with a firefly luciferase gene), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with humidified atmosphere and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.

This result could explain why tumor growth was remarkably suppressed in the CIK+NaHCO<sub>3</sub> group.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The acidic pH of the extracellular environment has a direct influence on a broad range of immunological functions (<xref rid="b18-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Previous studies on polymorphonuclear leukocytes demonstrate that this acidic pH mainly causes inhibition of chemotaxis, respiratory activity and bactericidal capacity (<xref rid="b19-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Evidence of impaired lymphocyte cytotoxicity and proliferation at acidic pH is also beginning to emerge (<xref rid="b21-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, clinical acidosis is accompanied by immunodeficiency (<xref rid="b22-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, other evidence has suggested that acidic microenvironments may play a role during neoplastic growth and invasion (<xref rid="b23-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>CIK cells are <italic>ex vivo</italic>-expanded T lymphocytes that share phenotypic and functional properties with both NK and T cells (<xref rid="b24-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In view of the conclusions of previous studies, it is reasonable for us to infer that acidic microenvironments of solid tumors will affect the antitumor activity of CIK cells. Based on the mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of CIK cells, including the fact that CIK cells bind to T cells, form cellular conjugates with tumor cells and secrete a large number of cytotoxic cytoplasmic granules that are cytolytic to T cells (<xref rid="b25-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and the fact that CIK cells secrete a number of cytokines (including IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor) that attack tumor cells (<xref rid="b26-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), the present study compared the antitumor activities of CIK cells or CM<sub>CIK</sub> against HCC at pH 6.5 and 7.4. The results revealed that the antitumor activities of both CIK cells and CM<sub>CIK</sub> against HepG2 cells were significantly compromised under an acidic environment, with 35 and 25% reduction in cytotoxicity and tumor inhibition, respectively. These results strongly suggested that neutralization of the acidic environment in the tumor tissue should be equally important as the CIK cell therapy itself. CIK cells would not be fully active unless the acidic environment in tumor tissue is neutralized.</p><p>Previous experimental and mathematical models have successfully demonstrated that it is possible to upregulate the pHe of tumors with little effect on systemic pH by chronic administration of sodium bicarbonate (<xref rid="b27-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, recent studies documented that oral administration of HCO<sub>3</sub>&#x02212; could actually inhibit tumor metastasis in prostate, breast and colon cancer cell line-derived tumors (<xref rid="b29-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This apparently occurred by reducing the extracellular acidity of the acid-extruding tumors, in the absence of changes in the pH of the blood or normal tissues (<xref rid="b29-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Previous findings suggested that certain enzymes such as cathepsins and matrix metalloproteases, which are involved in tumor invasion, were inhibited by alkalinization (<xref rid="b32-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In the present study, oral administration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was combined with CIK cell therapy in HCC-bearing nude mice to investigate whether NaHCO<sub>3</sub> could enhance the antitumor activity of CIK cells against HCC. The present data revealed a remarkable synergy between oral administration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and CIK cell therapy in treating grafted HepG2-luc carcinomas in nude mice, suggesting that oral NaHCO<sub>3</sub> administration may be sufficient to reduce the acidity of the tumor microenvironment, eventually enhancing the efficacy of CIK cell therapy. These findings and the <italic>in vitro</italic> results could explain one of the reasons why tumor cells thrive in the acidic environment, that is, due to the fact that the immune system is compromised in the acidic environment, thus facilitating the survival of tumor cells. Notably, oral administration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> alone failed to inhibit the growth of the tumor in nude mice. This result was consistent with a previous study (<xref rid="b28-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), in which NaHCO<sub>3</sub> administration was observed to have no effect on the growth of primary tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Thus, although NaHCO<sub>3</sub> inhibits spontaneous metastases by attenuating the function of certain enzymes, without the immune system, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is unable to inhibit the primary tumor growth. However, this is not the true situation of the patients with tumors in the clinic, since the majority of these patients are immunologically intact (<xref rid="b33-ol-0-0-5112" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, even without receiving any immunotherapy such as CIK cell therapy, it would be beneficial for these patients to ingest alkaline food or drinks, since it may aid the T lymphocytes to fight against the tumor cells in their bodies.</p><p>The present immunohistochemical studies on the tumor tissue from each group revealed a significantly augmented number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes infiltrating into the tumor mass when NaHCO<sub>3</sub> feeding was combined with CIK cell therapy, compared with CIK cell therapy alone. In addition, the perforin secreted by T lymphocytes, which is important in killing T cells, was also abundantly detected by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that the acidic environment appeared to prevent CIK cells from migrating into the tumor tissue, which may partially explain why immune cells such as CIK cells could not function well in an acidic environment. However, there may be other mechanisms involved, such as the acidic environment inhibiting the cytokine secretion of CIK cells, thus compromising their binding ability to the T cells. Further studies to explore the exact molecular mechanisms are warranted.</p><p>In summary, both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments of the present study demonstrated that the antitumor activities of CIK cells against HepG2 cells were significantly enhanced under alkaline or relatively less acidic environments, although the molecular mechanism involved require to be further investigated. The present results have provided novel insights for oncologists to treat their cancer patients, particularly when immunotherapy is considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education of China (Beijing, China; grant no. 20151092900), the
