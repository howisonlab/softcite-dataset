We hypothesized that anxiety symptoms would be prevalent, that higher MQ would be strongly and inversely related to anxiety symptoms, and that this relationship would be particularly strong in women who were Saudi nationals (where cultural factors might have the most influence).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>Identification of prior research studies was performed using the search terms: anxiety; BC; marital relationship; spouse; MQ; Middle East; and KSA in various combinations. These search words were entered into PubMed and Google Scholar to locate all relevant studies. A convenience sample of women with BC (volunteers) was recruited between January 2013 and March 2013 from King Abdulaziz University&#x02019;s (KAU) Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi Breast Cancer Center of Excellence in Jeddah, KSA. Consecutive women presenting to the outpatient clinic for initial assessment or follow-up were approached for inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 years; diagnosis of BC documented in the medical record; currently married; and attending the clinic on the day that the interviewers were present in the clinic. The exclusion criteria were women without BC, those outside the age range above, those who were not currently married, and all those being seen on days and times when interviewers were not present. The average length of time that participants were diagnosed with and/or experienced symptoms of BC were 38.4 months (range 2 weeks to 180 months). The questionnaire was translated into Arabic, and was self-completed by participants. Medical students (trained by KAU psychiatry faculty on how to approach patients, obtain consent, and administer the questionnaire) explained the study to the participants and obtained informed consent before proceeding. The institutional review board of KAU Hospital approved the study following the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Questionnaire</title><p>Participants were asked regarding their age (27-65 years), nationality/citizenship (Saudi=1 versus immigrant=0), education level (none=1, primary school only=2, high school only=3, university=4, post-graduate=5), employment status (yes=1 versus no=0), and family income per month (&#x0003c;3,000 Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR)=1; 3,000 to 5,000=2; &#x0003e;5,000=3).

One participant, however, completed only part of the questionnaire, leaving a final sample of 49. The average age of participants was 48.9 (SD=7.1) years, with a range from 35-65 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Most participants were Saudi citizens (58.3%). Three-quarters (73.5%) had graduated from high school or attended college, although only one-third (31.9%) were employed. The average yearly family income was 48,000 SAR (approximately $12,000 per year). The average duration of illness since diagnosis of BC was 3 years (38.4 months). The most common type of cancer treatment was surgery (89.8%), followed by chemotherapy (83.7%) and radiation therapy (57.1%). Marital adjustment, on average, was low to moderate. Perception of spouse support SPS averaged 16.7 (SD=3.9) on a theoretical range of 6-24, indicating low to moderate support compared with an average of 20 in Western samples.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The QMI averaged 31.0 (SD=5.7), indicating moderate MQ compared with scores in Western samples that have ranged from 28-37.<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The overall quality of the marital relationship (summing the SPS and QMI) averaged 47.6 (SD=8.7) with a theoretical score ranging from 12-66. The average number of anxiety symptoms was 5.6 (SD=3.8), ranging from 0-15 (where the theoretical score range was 0-21). The prevalence of &#x02018;possible&#x02019; anxiety disorder (HADS-A score 8-10) was 10.4% and &#x02018;probable&#x02019; anxiety disorder (HADS-A score 11-21) was 14.6%. The most common anxiety symptom was feeling frightened something awful would happen, while the least common symptom was having a sudden feeling of panic. Bivariate correlates of anxiety symptoms were lower education (r=-0.48, <italic>p</italic>=0.0005), lower income (r=-0.38, <italic>p</italic>=0.007), and not receiving radiation therapy (r=-0.32, <italic>p</italic>=0.03) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).

This prevalence rate of anxiety symptoms is similar to that reported in Western countries using the HADS (2-23% for probable anxiety disorder; 19-22% for possible disorder, 21-45% combined), although is on the low side.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Contrary to our predictions, the quality of the marital relationship was not significantly related to anxiety symptoms, and nationality (Saudi versus immigrant) did not moderate this relationship. More important as a risk factor for anxiety were age and education. Younger women were more likely to experience anxiety symptoms, as were women with lower education, lower income, and lack of employment (which education probably acted as a proxy for in multivariate analyses). No other characteristic (including time since diagnosis) was related to anxiety symptoms.</p><p>Our failure to find a relationship between anxiety symptoms and perceived support from the spouse, or quality of the marriage may be due to several factors. First, religious and cultural traditions in this patriarchal society may have led women to accept and successfully cope with lack of spousal support, and therefore adapt to their cancer in other ways - perhaps through support from other family members, or their religious beliefs. A second possibility was our sample size, which reduced the power of this study to detect significant relationships. However, the very weak relationship between overall marital adjustment and anxiety symptoms (B=-0.04, SE=0.05) reduces the likelihood that statistically or clinically significant relationships would be found even in a much larger sample. Third, women who participated in this study had been living with a diagnosis of BC for an average of 3 years and were still married. Not included were women whose diagnosis of BC led to marital discord and divorce. Such a selection effect would reduce the variability in anxiety symptoms and marital discord in our sample of married women whose marriages had endured and stabilized over time. The net effect of all these factors would be to lower our ability to detect an adverse effect of the BC diagnosis on anxiety symptoms and MQ.</p><p>The inverse relationship between age and anxiety found here has been reported by other researchers in Western countries, including studies in the United States,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Germany,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and Australia.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, this is the first time that an inverse association has been reported in the Middle East and Far East since the published studies from Iran<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and Thailand<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> did not find an association between anxiety and age. There are several reasons why younger women with BC are likely to have higher levels of anxiety. First, the diagnosis of BC at a young age is not &#x0201c;on time&#x0201d; as it might be in later life when cancer is more common and expected. Having one&#x02019;s life cut short by cancer can interfere with future dreams and hopes for family and work. Second, having BC diagnosed at a young age during the reproductive years can interfere with body image (following mastectomy), female identity, and sexual intimacy, and convey a sense of loss of control that may increase anxiety levels. Younger women may also be less likely to agree to, and comply with hormonal therapies that interfere with their sexual activity,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and may cause premature menopause,<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> increasing anxiety toward the course of the cancer and premature mortality. Finally, the strongest risk factor we identified for anxiety was lower education. Again, this finding is consistent with reports from Western countries, such as Germany<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and Australia,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> although is inconsistent with one of the only studies on anxiety in BC patients in the Middle East, where higher levels of education were associated with more anxiety (Iran).<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Women with lower education may not be aware of the surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation therapies available that successfully cure BC or improve its prognosis, or in some instances, may not be able to afford such treatments. Imagining a death sentence with BC, or a poor prognosis when nothing can be done could certainly increase anxiety.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>We acknowledge several limitations of the present study. First, the sample was a relatively small convenience sample and acquired from only one university-based urban BC clinic, which limits our ability to generalize the study findings to women with BC in rural areas, or those seeking care in other government-supported and private settings. Second, the cross-sectional nature of these analyses precludes speculation regarding the direction of effects in the relationships detected (namely, a hereditary predisposition to anxiety could just as well impair women&#x02019;s ability to complete their education, as lack of education could lead to greater anxiety). Third, detailed information on cancer stage, severity of disability, or interference with mobility, and the presence of other medical co-morbidities were not assessed, limiting our ability to control for these factors in multivariate analyses. Finally, the way in which anxiety was measured (by a count of symptoms and their severity) did not allow for an assessment of interference with social, occupational, or recreational functioning, precluding our ability to determine the true prevalence of anxiety disorder. Nevertheless, this study also has a number of strengths. First, we used standard psychometrically valid measures to assess anxiety symptoms and MQ, and carefully analyzed the data using stepwise multivariate statistics. Second, the use of the HADS-A to assess anxiety symptoms allows for comparison of our results with past studies, and those to be conducted in the future. Third, to our knowledge, this is the first report from KSA on the prevalence or correlates of anxiety symptoms and the relationship between MQ and anxiety symptoms in married women with BC. Given the important role that religion, cultural, and social forces play in this part of the world,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> these initial preliminary findings should help to stimulate future research on anxiety in women with BC in this country and throughout the Middle East.</p><p>In conclusion, anxiety symptoms are present in a significant number of married women with BC being followed up in a university-based BC clinic in Jeddah, KSA, especially those who are younger and with lower education. Although weak trends were found in the expected direction, no significant relationship was found between perceptions of spousal support or quality of the marital relationship and anxiety symptoms. Cultural factors, low power due to sample size, high quality of care, and a selection effect may at least partially explain these findings. Given that between 15% and 25% of women with BC experience significant anxiety symptoms, these findings should stimulate clinicians to screen women with BC for anxiety and other mood symptoms, and then treat significant symptoms with psychotherapy and/or appropriate doses of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
