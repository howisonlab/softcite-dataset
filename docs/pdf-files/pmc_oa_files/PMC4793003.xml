proposes radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to improve and enhance the
effectiveness of the upper extremity rehabilitation. [Subjects and Methods] People use
their upper extremities to conduct daily activities. When recovering from injuries, many
patients neglect the importance of rehabilitation, which results in degraded function.
This study recorded the training process using the traditional rehabilitation hand gliding
cart with a RFID reader, RFID tags in the panel, and a servo host computer. [Results]
Clinical evidence, time taken to achieve a full score, counts of missing the specified
spots, and Brunnstrom stage of aided recovery, the proximal part of the upper extremity
show that the RFID-based upper extremity training significantly and reduce negative
impacts of the disability in daily life and activities. [Conclusion] This study combined a
hand-gliding cart with an RFID reader, and when patients moved the cart, the movement
could be observed via the activated RFID tags. The training data was collected and
quantified for a better understanding of the recovery status of the patients. Each of the
participating patients made progress as expected.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>RFID</kwd><kwd>Hand-gliding cart</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the modern, tense, busy environment, sudden incidents, car accidents, and occupational
injuries can easily cause severe body impairment, and strokes and spinal injuries result in
many becoming physically impaired. Following recovery from injury, many patients may still
suffer muscle atrophy due to lying in bed for too long, and through lack of attentive care
of their body condition. This post-recovery syndrome may result in gradual degradation of
the original muscle functions and ultimately, lead to difficulties in movement and
rehabilitation. Therefore, it is very important to provide patients with effective
post-recovery rehabilitation.</p><p>Most physical human actions involve the use of the upper extremities. According to the U.S.
National Security Agency, one-third of occupationally impaired body functions are in the
upper extremities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In its functional
disability standards, the American Medical Association identifies losing one arm as
equivalent to losing 60% of the body mechanism, and the loss of a hand equates to the loss
of 90% of the arm function or 54% of the entire body mechanism<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Apparently, having healthy upper extremities is an important
issue.</p><p>Generally, patients with upper extremity disability need to use rehabilitation equipment
for repetitive training, to have the best chance of recovering full function of the
extremity. There are a variety of upper extremity rehabilitation therapies. The one seen
most commonly uses mechanical arms to guide patients during passive or active training. Kreb
used a mechanical arm MIT-MANS of his own creation to rehabilitate 20 stroke patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this treatment, a video-game-type
interface on a screen is used to guide the patients to move the mechanical arms to help them
rehabilitate their auxiliary nerves. Szturm suggests that using a volleyball and toys easily
available in daily life, together with sensors and video games, can make the rehabilitation
process much more fun and lively, and the training data can be quantified. With a
custom-made mechanical device<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, J.
Alastair Cozens put the patients&#x02019; impaired upper extremity on a controlling lever<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and during the rehabilitation process, the
upper arm is fixed, while the forearm makes 10 to 80 degree flexion/stretching movements
guided by a blinking light at the front. This mechanical device can provide feedback on
movement distance, measured by a electronic protractor and accelerometer, and use it as a
parameter for a servomotor to adjust the pushing and pulling force applied to the
rehabilitative movement. Gui Bin Song recommended bilateral arm training as well as
functional task training in clinical interventions&#x02019; to improve upper limb functional
activities of daily living of patients with hemiplegia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The above upper extremity rehabilitation systems can collect
detailed training data; however, their common problem is their high implementation cost and
their size, which is too large to be portable. Y-S Hwang et al. used a magnetic sensor and
reed switches to track the movement of the upper extremity during rehabilitation
training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Toshiaki Tanaka suggested
that a virtual environment system might be effective at facilitating motor relearning of the
upper extremity for stroke patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Kyoung-Hee Lee reported that a virtual reality exercise program was effective at restoring
the function of stroke patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Seong-Sik Kim showed that motor imagery training has a positive influence on upper extremity
performance by improving functional mobility during stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jungseo Park et al. suggested that
virtual reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit is an effective intervention for the
muscle activities of the TA and MG of normal adults<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shogo Hiragami et al. suggested that mirror therapy in addition to
a conventional rehabilitation program can be effective for finger motor dysfunction after
stroke<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another common rehabilitation
approach is to use simple physical movement therapy, even though its recovery efficacy is
subjective. Computer-aided rehabilitation can help patients with upper extremity disability
perform easy, relaxing, and systematic rehabilitative exercises, and the training data can
be quantified and saved in a database for later medical use. Digital processing enables
medical personnel to better understand patients&#x02019; recovery conditions, and to conduct
long-term tracking. Furthermore, the data can be very helpful in clinical diagnosis.</p><p>In this study, a simple approach to rehabilitation was taken to help patients recover upper
extremity function. The equipment used was a panel of RFID tags, a computer server, and a
hand-gliding cart with an RFID reader. When a patient moves the hand-gliding cart across the
panel, the screen automatically displays the route taken by the gliding cart, and the route
spots during the course of the movement are recorded for quantification. This auxiliary
device, developed for this study of rehabilitation training, can actually help patients
stretch their impaired upper extremities, prevent continual upper extremity atrophy, and
reduce the negative impact of disability on daily life and activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The purpose of this study was to help patients with the rehabilitation of their upper
extremities. With the helping force of the gliding cart, patients moved their hands, which
stretched their upper extremities, facilitating rehabilitation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Traditional hand-gliding

therapist is beside the patient to provide guidance. However, the training data in the
course of rehabilitation cannot be recorded.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figure 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Overall conceptual
diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-519-g002"/></fig> demonstrates the overall conceptual diagram of this study. There is a matrix of RFID
tags beneath the panel for the extremity rehabilitation training, and at the bottom of the
hand-gliding cart, there is an RFID reader. When the patient glides the cart across the
panel, it causes the RFID tags to react, and a reactive message is sent to a computer
server, which calculates the coordinates. These positional coordinates are stored in a
database for calculation of the training scores. A dragger is connected to the hand-gliding
cart via a traction line, and this dragger is used to adjust the pulling force on the
traction line. Patients participating in the training first finish medical record
authentication, and then proceed to rehabilitation training. The patient puts the
functionally impaired hand on the handle of the hand-gliding cart (1) to move the cart, and
the RFID tags (2) along the route of the cart&#x02019;s movement are activated and their data is
read by the RFID reader (3) and sent to the server (4) for calculation of the trajectory (&#x0221e;)
and to be saved in the database (5). The panel incorporates 30 rows &#x000d7; 20 columns of RFID
tags which are used to monitor the trajectory (&#x0221e;) of the cart. The hand-training unit
provides an illustration of the actions. The back of the patient&#x02019;s hand is fixed with Velcro
when the patient&#x02019;s palm is placed precisely on the cart&#x02019;s handle for pushing the gliding
cart.</p><p>The RFID tag is small, light, and resistant to external interference, which makes it very
suitable for use in a limited-space environment.</p><p>The diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Implementation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-519-g003"/></fig> shows the training implemented in this study: (1) the hand-gliding cart used for
training and testing, (2) the specific route patterns displayed on the screen as training
and testing guidance, and (3) the moving tracks of the gliding cart. The cart is displayed
in blue when it moves correctly along the specified route, and is red otherwise.
Furthermore, the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref> shows three
specific routes with differing widths along which the cart, displayed as red or blue,
moves.</p><p>The tracks displayed on the screen allow visual inspection for a comparison with previous
results (records of the tracks), and they can be set into the predefined background track
map (specified route map). When loading multiple records of tracks, they can be
distinguished by user-defined or system-default colors, and the multiple tracks of movement
displayed on the screen can be compared visually to allow the rehabilitator to adjust the
training program.</p><p>The participant needs to finish the identification authentication before the rehabilitation
commences. The screen displays specific patterns for the participant to copy when moving the
cart. The training data are transmitted to a computer server for the calculation of the
number of trajectory errors and the time taken, as well as for data storage.</p><p>The experiments performed in this study had two parts: testing with subjects with normal
upper extremity functions and testing with subjects with upper extremity impairments. The 6

Participants P1, P5 and P9 showed changes in their Brunnstrom stage of the
proximal part of the upper extremity from category IV to V. Participants P2, P3 and P6 also
showed changes in their Brunnstrom stage of the proximal part of the upper extremity from
category IV to V, but their performances in the 3rd and 4th weeks showed no progress,
probably due to their older ages resulting in reduced physical strength and weaker
responsiveness. Thus, rectification of their inappropriate movement had little effect.
Participants P4, P7, P8 and P10 showed changes in their Brunnstrom stage of the proximal
part of the upper extremity from category III to IV, and their performance in the first
three weeks in terms of the &#x0201c;time taken to achieve full score&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;counts of missing the
specified spots&#x0201d; showed steady progress. However, the results remained the same in the 4th
week, which indicates that their muscles tensions were reducing, but that their capability
of self-controlled extremity activity had improved and therefore, the chance of isolated
movement had also improved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study combined a gliding cart with an RFID reader, and when patients moved the cart,
its track was recorded via the activated RFID tags. Training data was collected and
quantified for a better understanding of the recovery status of the patients. Each of the
participating patients made progress as expected.</p><p>The movement trajectory (tracks) can be adjusted in clinical experiments depending on the
patient&#x02019;s condition. That is, when the patient&#x02019;s upper extremity is more severely impaired,
the &#x0221e;-shaped trajectory can be easily modified by changing the settings of the computer
server, so that the patient can be encouraged to continue with the training. In addition,
funny games can be added to the training program to make the training more lively, and the
rehabilitation effect can be improved<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When extremities are paralyzed, rehabilitation should be started as soon as possible for a
better recovery effect, and for gaining an exercise pattern closer to normal movement. In
the beginning, a patient can exercise the normal extremity to trigger the impaired one to
move. That is, making use of the simultaneousness and interchangeableness of the two upper
extremities to repeat the training exercises, so that movement of the impaired extremity can
be triggered. Most importantly, persistent practice is the best way to achieve a good
rehabilitation result.</p><p>This study was subject to several limitations. Participants were reporting no progress with
activities of daily living using the affected upper extremity, no control group was included
in the study, and other factors such as the maturation effect and possible rater bias in the
evaluation, may have affected the results. Replication of this study with a larger sample
size, longer treatment period, and use of a placebo group in a randomized controlled trial
is desirable. A study of the long-term effects of this treatment should also be conducted by
establishing follow-up period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank S.C. Chen M.D. of the Taipei Medical University for clinical
