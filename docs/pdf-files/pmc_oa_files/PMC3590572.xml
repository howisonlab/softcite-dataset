The experiments indicate that it efficiently inhibits the cleavage step of the enzyme reaction, fitting well into the catalytic site. Surprisingly the compound, when incubated with the binary topoisomerase&#x02013;DNA cleaved complex, helps the enzyme to remove itself from the cleaved DNA and close the DNA gap, increasing the religation rate. The compound also induces the religation of the stalled enzyme&#x02013;CPT (camptothecin)&#x02013;DNA ternary complex. Analysis of the molecule docked over the binary complex, together with its chemical properties, suggests that the religation enhancement is due to the presence on the compound of two oxygen atoms that act as hydrogen acceptors. This property facilitates the deprotonation of the 5&#x02032; DNA end, suggesting that this is the limiting step in the topoisomerase religation mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>camptothecin</kwd><kwd>molecular docking</kwd><kwd>religation rate</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase I</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>CPT, camptothecin</kwd><kwd>Et-KuQ, 1-ethylKuQuinone</kwd><kwd>TBS, Tris-buffered saline</kwd><kwd>Top1, topoisomerase I</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA topoisomerases are key enzymes that modulate the topological state of DNA through the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands. There are two classes of topoisomerases (types I and II), both characterized by a catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic attack of a DNA phosphodiester bond by a tyrosyl residue from the enzyme, but type&#x000a0;I cleaves a single DNA strand, whereas type&#x000a0;II cleaves both strands. The human Top1 (topoisomerase I) enzyme is composed of 765 amino acids and has four distinct domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain (1&#x02013;214), the core domain (215&#x02013;635), the linker domain (636&#x02013;712) and the COOH-terminal domain (713&#x02013;765) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of reconstituted N-terminal truncated version of human Top1&#x000a0;in complex with a 22&#x000a0;bp DNA molecule shows the enzyme organized in multiple domains, which &#x02018;clamp on&#x02019; the DNA molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The active site tyrosine (Tyr<sup>723</sup>) starts the catalytic cycle of the enzyme through a nucleophilic attack on the DNA backbone, resulting in the breakage of one DNA strand with the enzyme covalently attached to the 3&#x02032;-phosphate to form the cleavable complex. After changing the linking number a second nucleophilic attack, driven by the 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl DNA end, restores an intact double-stranded DNA, and the enzyme is released. In both cases, to become a nucleophile the hydroxylic group belonging to the tyrosine or to the DNA end must donate a proton to a nearby group that has been proposed to be the lateral chain of Lys<sup>532</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>DNA Top IB can be inhibited by several compounds that act through different mechanisms, such as prevention of DNA&#x02013;topoisomerase binding, inhibition of DNA cleavage or stabilization of the cleavable complex. Inhibitors of Top1 are divided into two classes: poisons and catalytic inhibitors. Poisons include clinically used drugs, such as the derivatives of the natural compound CPT (camptothecin) that reversibly binds the covalent Top1&#x02013;DNA complex slowing down the religation of the cleaved DNA strand, thus inducing cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Two water-soluble CPT derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan have been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for clinical use. The 3D structure of the topotecan&#x02013;enzyme&#x02013;DNA ternary complex has shown that topotecan mimics a DNA base-pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (&#x02212;1) and downstream (+1) base-pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] interacting also with the enzyme, acting as an interfacial uncompetitive inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, catalytic inhibitors act through inhibiting any other step of the Top1 enzymatic cycle. They include both natural and non-natural compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and they mainly act by inhibiting the cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or the DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], although some of them are able to inhibit both cleavage and religation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The CPT derivatives are widely used in clinics; however, they have some intrinsic limits, the main one being linked to the equilibrium of the &#x003b1;-hydroxylactone E-ring of CPTs with the carboxylate form, which is inactive against Top1 and tightly binds to serum albumin. For this reason, other drugs are under development, the most promising one being indolocarbazoles and the indenoisoquinolines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that the ADP&#x02013;ribose polymers, that is rapidly synthesized by PARP [poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose) polymerase], activated by the occurrence of a DNA break, is also able to interact with human Topo I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The interaction has been elegantly shown to produce two important effects, the first one being the cleavage inhibition, the second one consisting in the enhancement of the religation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The second effect is quite astonishing and poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose) has been up to now the only molecule able to induce this effect, although the molecular mechanism is still unclear.</p><p>In this work, in the search for a new topoisomerase poison, we have investigated the interaction of the enzyme with Et-KuQ (1-ethylKuQuinone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), a pentacyclic-diquinoid synthetic compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The results indicate that Et-KuQ inhibits cleavage and enhances religation in the presence of CPT. A mechanism for such a process is provided and it is proposed to also occur in the case of poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of KuQ</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure and dissociation equilibrium of Et-KuQ.

The polycyclic system can be considered a naphthoquinone derivative and its name is due to the structural similarities with vitamin K. In this work the Et-KuQ has been reacted with the human Top1 enzyme. The main feature of its structure is the presence of a pentacyclic skeleton (similarly to CPT) with a double-quinone functional group; the five rings consist of two naphthalene units fused through a 5-membered moiety that contains an alkyl chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Extended electronic conjugation is proved by the intense absorption spectrum with a broad band between 400 and 600&#x000a0;nm. These molecules were isolated as enol tautomers stabilized by the intramolecular hydrogen bond with the nearest carbonyl group, as shown in the crystal structure of the Et-KuQ derivative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The strong hydrogen-bond interaction is evidenced by the very high value of the chemical shift (18 ppm) of the enolic hydrogen in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. On the other hand, the shift of the relative tautomeric equilibrium towards the keto form appears to be strongly sensitive to solvent polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity. Therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the keto tautomer is favoured in aqueous media; a complete characterization of the equilibrium is under current investigation.</p><p>The pH dependence of the spectrum permits us to evaluate a pK<sub>a</sub> of 5&#x02013;6 for the equilibrium between a protonated and a deprotonated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The unusual acidity of the compound compares well with that reported for the hipposudoric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], a natural structurally related compound. In fact, the conjugate base of Et-KuQ, i.e. the enolate species, is particularly stable because of the stabilization of the negative charge within the molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Et-KuQ inhibits the relaxation activity of Top1</title><p>The relaxation activity of native Top1 has been assessed by incubating the enzyme in the presence of increasing concentration of Et-KuQ in a plasmid relaxation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The simultaneous addition of enzyme, Et-KuQ and DNA never resulted in complete inhibition of the plasmid relaxation activity up to a concentration of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. The inhibitory effect is greater when the enzyme is pre-incubated with Et-KuQ before adding DNA and the compound fully inhibits the relaxation at a concentration of 12.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 14). An additional control has been performed (C2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 20) by adding the drug to the DNA plasmid, demonstrating that the Et-KuQ does not permit DNA migration and so does not bind to DNA.

In detail, a 5&#x02032; end radiolabelled oligonucleotide CL14 (5&#x02032;-GAAAAAAGACTTAG-3&#x02032;) was annealed to the CP25 (5&#x02032;-TAAAAATTTTTCTAAGTCTTTT-TTC-3&#x02032;) complementary strand, to produce a duplex with an 11-base 5&#x02032; single-strand extension that is preferentially cut by the enzyme at the site indicated by the arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, top). The religation step is precluded, because the dinucleotide, generated during cleavage, is too short to be religated, leaving the enzyme covalently attached to the 3&#x02032; end of the oligonucleotide. The data indicate that in the absence of the drug the wild-type protein shows a typical time-dependent cleavage of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;7), whereas pre-incubation of the enzyme with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ fully inhibits the cleavage reaction (lanes 8&#x02013;13). The inhibitory effect of the compound, after a simultaneous incubation with both the enzyme and the suicide substrate, is also clear (lanes 14&#x02013;19), although lower than that observed for the pre-incubation. These results can be well appreciated from the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(B) where the percentage of cleavage is reported as a function of time. In detail in the absence of the drug (black line) the maximum of the cleaved product is observed after 4&#x000a0;min, while in the presence of the drug preincubated with enzyme (grey line with circles), no cleaved product is observed in the first 4&#x000a0;min and a small percentage is observed in the 8&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min time window. This result unambiguously indicates that Et-KuQ is an inhibitor of cleavage and that its interaction with the enzyme is reversible due to the appearance of a small percentage of cleaved product at long times.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cleavage kinetics</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course (0.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min) of the cleavage experiment between the CL14/CP25 suicide substrate and the purified Top1 alone (lanes 2&#x02013;7), after 10&#x000a0;min pre-incubation with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ (lanes 8&#x02013;13) or simultaneously incubated with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ (lanes 14&#x02013;19).

In all the experiments, the KCl concentration is maintained at 350&#x000a0;mM when R11 is added to the samples, in order to avoid the religated product being cleaved again by the protein, since cleavage reaction is inhibited at high salt concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Aliquots have been removed at different times, the reaction stopped by addition of SDS and the products analysed by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

A quantitative analysis of this result is shown in the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>(B). This is to our knowledge the first time that a small organic compound acts as a stimulator of the Top1 religation reaction. The same experiment, performed using an excess of Et-KuQ (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), shows that, at this high Et-KuQ concentration, an increase of the rate of religation is observed also when the compound is added together with the R11 substrate (see Supplementary Figure S1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/033/bsr033e025add.htm">http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/033/bsr033e025add.htm</ext-link>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Religation kinetics</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel analysis of the religation kinetics (0.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min) between the wild-type suicide covalent complex (Cl1) and the R11 complementary oligonucleotide (shown at the top of the Figure) in the absence of Et-KuQ (lanes 2&#x02013;7), after pre-incubation with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ (lanes 8&#x02013;13), or incubated together with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ (lanes 14&#x02013;19).

The assay was done at two different times: 1 and 2&#x000a0;min, respectively, for the substrate and the enzyme alone (lanes 1 and 2), in the presence of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CPT (lanes 3 and 4), or with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ (lanes 5 and 6), or after incubating the reaction mixture with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CPT and then adding 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ and stopping the reaction after another minute (lane 7), or incubating with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Et-KuQ for 1&#x000a0;min and then adding 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CPT and stopping the reaction after another minute (lane 8). The reactions were stopped with SDS, the samples digested with trypsin and the products analysed by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). In the presence of DMSO, the cleavage/religation equilibrium is shifted towards religation and a small level of cleavage of the labelled DNA strand is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). When the enzyme is in the presence of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CPT the cleavage/religation equilibrium is shifted towards cleavage, since CPT reversibly binds to the covalent DNA&#x02013;enzyme intermediate, stabilizing it and slowing down the religation rate, as indicated by the band indicated by the asterisk corresponding to the substrate cleaved at the preferred site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The band of the cleavage complex is not observed when Et-KuQ is added to the enzyme together with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6), confirming that the compound inhibits the cleavage step.

The most striking result is obtained upon addition of Et-KuQ to the enzyme previously reacted with the substrate in the presence of CPT. The Et-KuQ addition brings to 50% destabilization of the cleaved complex stabilized by CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 7 compared with lane 4). This result indicates that Et-KuQ is able to stimulate the religation even in the presence of CPT, overcoming the poisoning effect of the drug on inhibiting the religation. A quantification of the cleaved complex observed in the different assays is shown in the histogram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(B), that indicates the ability of Et-KuQ to reduce the CPT stabilization of the cleaved complex (compare lane 4 with lanes 7 and 8).

In this complex the ethyl group of the drug and its aromatic scaffold show van der Waals interactions with the DNA major grove at the level of the bases in positions &#x02212;1 and +1, while the deprotonated oxygen molecules of Et-KuQ form an hydrogen bond with the lateral chain of Asn<sup>722</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This structure permits us to provide an interpretation of the effect of the compound during the religation process.

The Et-KuQ pK<sub>a</sub> defining the equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form is 5.6&#x000a0;in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and this value can be slightly modulated by the protein environment, facilitating the acceptance of an hydrogen by the two oxygen molecules that are at an average distance of 6.7 &#x000c5; from the oxydryl group of the DNA 5&#x02032;end in the docked complex with the covalent enzyme&#x02013;DNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This distance is shorter than the one observed in the X-ray diffraction structure between the O5&#x02032; and the lateral chain of Lys<sup>532</sup> (3), that is supposed to be the proton acceptor in the reaction in the absence of any external compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This short distance, coupled with the hydrogen acceptor property of the two oxygen molecules, explains the increased religation rate promoted by Et-KuQ.</p><p>The same characteristics can be proposed to explain the Et-KuQ ability in displacing the stalled CPT&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;enzyme ternary complex and promoting the religation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In this case the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules-O5&#x02032; DNA distance, observed in the docked structure, is about 7 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), permitting the deprotonation of the DNA oxydryl group. In this latter case two possible mechanisms can be envisaged. (1) The DNA oxydryl group releases its proton to the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules and the deprotonated 5&#x02032; end forces the CPT displacement promoting the religation reaction. (2) The DNA hydroxyl group releases its proton to the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules and the reversible binding of CPT finds the deprotonated 5&#x02032; ready to religate during the CPT off process. In both cases, the final result is that the religation occurs and CPT is displaced.</p><p>Recently it has been proposed that poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose) displays a similar effect: it inhibits the cleavage, but it also reverses the preformed covalent Top&#x02013;DNA complex, stimulating the religation activity of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is probable that the same mechanism proposed for Et-KuQ can also work for the poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose) polymer. The complex structure of the poly(ADP&#x02013;ribose), made by many phosphate groups, may facilitate the deprotonation of the 5&#x02032; DNA end, again facilitating the religation. It can then be concluded that facilitation of the deprotonation of the 5&#x02032; DNA end is the crucial process to promote religation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Barbara Arn&#x000f2; carried out the majority of the experimental part of the study, helped by Cinzia Tesauro and Laura Zuccaro.
