Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that Snapin, a SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein-25) interacting protein, interacts with LRRK2. An <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay exhibited that Snapin is phosphorylated by LRRK2. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay showed that LRRK2 may interact with Snapin via its Ras-of-complex (ROC) and N-terminal domains, with no significant difference on interaction of Snapin with LRRK2 wild type (WT) or its pathogenic mutants. Further analysis by mutation study revealed that Threonine 117 of Snapin is one of the sites phosphorylated by LRRK2. Furthermore, a Snapin T117D phosphomimetic mutant decreased its interaction with SNAP-25 in the GST pull-down assay. SNAP-25 is a component of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor) complex and is critical for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Incubation of rat brain lysate with recombinant Snapin T117D, but not WT, protein caused decreased interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNARE complex based on a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We further found that LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Snapin in the hippocampal neurons resulted in a decrease in the number of readily releasable vesicles and the extent of exocytotic release. Combined, these data suggest that LRRK2 may regulate neurotransmitter release via control of Snapin function by inhibitory phosphorylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>LRRK2</kwd><kwd>Snapin</kwd><kwd>SNAP-25</kwd><kwd>SNARE vesicle</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) has been identified as a gene corresponding to PARK8, a locus causing familial Parkinson's disease (PD) in an autosomal-dominant manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and affects more than 1&#x00025; of people older than 65 years.

Recombinant Flag-tagged Snapin WT and indicated mutant proteins were subjected to a GST pull-down assay using GST-SNAP-25 and detected by western blot analysis using anti-Flag antibody. Coomassie blue staining of GST and GST-SNAP-25 showed that similar amounts of each protein were used.

The myc-tagged LRRK2 G2019S was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated beads were co-incubated with recombinant flag tagged Snapin WT protein with ATP under the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay conditions. The supernatant was co-incubated with purified GST-SNAP-25 and subjected to a GST pull-down assay and SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

The amount of Snapin in each brain lysates (20&#x00025; input) was shown with Snapin antibody (Abnova, 1:500 dilution, Snapin-low). The immunoprecipitates, which showed no signal under the diluted condition above, were subjected to western blot analysis with more concentrated Snapin antibody (Abnova, 1:50 dilution, Snapin-high).
