In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation. Here, we identify E2F7 as a novel target of miR-26a. We show that E2F7 significantly promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML cells. We also demonstrate that E2F7 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) promoter repressing its expression. Moreover, interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) transcriptional activity. This leads to the downregulation of c-Myc transcriptional target miR-17-92 cluster, whose expression has a well-defined role in contributing to block monocytic differentiation and sustain AML cell proliferation. Finally, we show that the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in primary blasts from AML patients. Thus, these findings indicate that the newly identified miR-26a target E2F7 might have an important role in monocytic differentiation and leukemogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microRNAs</kwd><kwd>miR-26a</kwd><kwd>E2F7</kwd><kwd>acute myeloid leukemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy in which immature progenitor cells accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) and eventually in blood and organs interfering with the production of normal blood cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> AML is characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations in progenitor cells that produce complete or partial blockage at different stages of myeloid differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Studying the functional interactions between genes that control the correct balance between cell proliferation and differentiation is critical to understand how their deregulated expression may contribute to leukemogenesis.</p><p>Cells derived from different AML French&#x02013;American&#x02013;British (FAB) subtypes, from M2 to M5, can be induced to differentiate, by specific agents, into cells that resemble normal counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> In particular, the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> metabolite 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (VitD3) can arrest proliferation of leukemic cells with a concomitant differentiation into more mature monocyte/macrophage cellular phenotype; thus, it is considered a good model for normal monocytic differentiation studies. One of the mechanisms responsible for the effect of VitD3 on monocyte/macrophage differentiation is the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> This multifunctional protein contributes to the cell cycle arrest and protection against apoptosis observed in mature monocytes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that have been shown to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including differentiation and oncogenesis, via the post-transcriptional regulation of protein coding genes. Several studies indicated that miRNAs are critical regulators of molecular networks involved in hematopoietic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Moreover, deregulation of miRNA expression characterizes different subtypes of AML and may contribute to leukemogenesis by altering normal hematopoietic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Taken together with protein factors, miRNAs have important roles in VitD3-induced cell cycle arrest and monocytic differentiation of AML cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup></p><p>Myc proteins are found to have a relevant role in controlling blood cell homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> They are transcription factors with essential roles in cell growth and proliferation through their ability to both positively and negatively regulate the expression of coding and noncoding genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> C-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) is frequently activated in AML and has an important role in the induction of leukemogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Notably, c-Myc transcriptionally represses p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression, thereby sustaining AML cell proliferation.

One of the relevant miRNAs repressed by c-Myc in hematopoietic malignancies is miR-26a,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> which was shown to act as a tumor suppressor in different types of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p><p>In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation of AML cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> In addition, we have shown that miR-26a was downregulated in primary AML blasts and, if reconstituted in AML cell lines, was able to decrease proliferation and induce myeloid differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, the mechanism underlying this effect was not fully understood. Here, we identify the transcriptional repressor E2F7 as a novel target for miR-26a function in AML. We show that E2F7 promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML cells. The repression of E2F7 by miR-26a contributes to the increased expression of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> observed during VitD3-induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells. In addition, interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc activity and downregulation of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster. Finally, we further show that, conversely to miR-26a, the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in AML blasts. Therefore, we identified a new regulatory network that might have a relevant role in leukemogenesis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML</title><p>We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G<sub>1</sub>/S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from TargetScan (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">www.targetscan.org</ext-link>) and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator of the G<sub>1</sub>/S-phase transition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The 3'-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3&#x02032;-UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3&#x02032;-UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3&#x02032;-UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3&#x02032;-UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1&#x02013;2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3&#x02032;-UTR (Mut1&#x02013;2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3&#x02032;-UTR.</p><p>To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.</p><p>We also examined the expression levels of E2F7 protein and miR-26a during monocytic differentiation of U937 induced by VitD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). As expected, E2F7 protein levels decreased upon monocytic differentiation and are inversely correlated to miR-26a levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Similar results were obtained during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We previously showed that miR-26a is downregulated in primary AML samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Thus, we analyzed E2F7 expression levels in human monocytes isolated from healthy donors and diagnostic samples of AML patients by real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

These cells differentiate into mature monocytes by treatment with VitD3, a process mainly mediated by p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression and subsequent G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Cells were infected with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against E2F7 (L-shE2F7) or scramble shRNA (L-shSCR) and differentiation was evaluated by analyzing the morphology, immunophenotype and induction of specific molecular markers. Cells infected with Lenti-shE2F7 exhibited almost a complete depletion of E2F7 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Strikingly, the depletion of E2F7 induced drastic changes in the morphology of transduced cells. A nuclear condensation and more abundant cytoplasm were observed, indicating an induction of myeloid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Notably, cells interfering with E2F7 presented a more pronounced differentiation upon VitD3 treatment with a feature of matured monocytes/macrophages, such us indented nuclei, increased cytoplasmic processes and granules. Immunophenotype was analyzed to further examine differentiation. A strong increase in cells expressing the surface markers, cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), which are upregulated during myelomonocytic differentiation, was observed upon depletion of E2F7 and treatment with VitD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>). We also measured mRNA expression levels for marker of monocytic differentiation such as M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We detected a strong increase in monocytic markers upon inhibition of E2F7 expression by RNAi, even in the absence of any inducer, indicating that the depletion of E2F7 is sufficient to commit U937 toward monocytic differentiation. Similar results were obtained with HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that decreased E2F7 levels stimulated monocytic/macrophage differentiation of AML cells.</p><p>In AML, the terminal differentiation block is strictly related to aberrant proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Thus, to better understand the activity of E2F7 in leukemic cells, we analyzed the effect of E2F7 on cellular proliferation and cell cycle. U937 cells infected with L-shE2F7 showed lower proliferation rate than control L-shSCR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In addition, cell cycle analysis showed that silencing of E2F7 expression increased the percentage of cells in G<sub>1</sub> arrest and decreased the number of cells in the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b and c</xref>). Expression analysis of relevant cell cycle regulators by real-time PCR (qPCR) indicated that E2F7 silencing reduced the levels of several positive regulators of the G1 phase, including CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Similar results were obtained with HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These data indicated that endogenous E2F7 could be essential for maintaining cellular proliferation of AML cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased E2F7 levels counteract monocytic differentiation and stimulate proliferation of AML cells</title><p>We next evaluated whether enforced expression of E2F7 affected the differentiation status and proliferation of AML cells. Thus, we cloned an E2F7 derivative with a 3&#x02032;-UTR devoid of miRNA target sites in a stable and Tet-on inducible system derived from the enhanced PiggyBac (ePiggyBac) transposon (EBP-PURO) giving rise to the EBP-PURO-E2F7 construct. Doxycycline (Dox) treatment of U937 cells transformed with EBP-PURO-E2F7 increased the levels of E2F7 as compared with those transformed with the empty vector EBP-PURO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Moreover, E2F7 overexpression is retained after VitD3 treatment, when endogenous E2F7 protein levels decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). High levels of E2F7 resulted in a reduction of VitD3-induced monocytic differentiation assessed by morphological changes and percentage of CD11- and CD14-positive cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c&#x02013;e</xref>). Moreover, enforced E2F7 expression resulted in increased proliferation rate and percentage of cells in the S phase, while decreased the number of cells arrested in the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b, f and g</xref>). Notably, this effect is maintained even after VitD3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5f and g</xref>). Altogether, these data indicated that increased levels of E2F7 stimulated proliferation and counteracted monocytic differentiation of AML cells; therefore, suggesting that one of the pathways by which miR-26a promotes monocytopoiesis of AML cells is through E2F7 repression.</p></sec><sec><title>E2F7 represses p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression</title><p>To explain the effect of E2F7 on AML cells, we investigated the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup>, which has a crucial role in inducing cell cycle arrest and monocytic differentiation of AML cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and whose levels are increased upon VitD3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

To clarify whether E2F7 binds the p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with an E2F7 antibody. To assess the specific binding of E2F7, ChIP experiments were performed on cells treated with VitD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) or upon repression of E2F7 expression by shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). A specific enrichment of the p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> promoter regions in E2F7-immunoprecipitated samples from untreated cells was observed. Notably, the immunoprecipitations were strongly reduced after VitD3 treatment or RNAi for E2F7, in accordance with the decreased E2F7 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>).

The E2F7 knockdown in AML cells delayed cell cycle progression and in particular G1/S transition, which was not consistent with previous data obtained in fibroblast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Notably, similar results have been described for the other atypical E2F factor E2F8 in hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> This suggests that E2F7, like E2F8, could act as a positive or negative regulator of cell cycle progression in a cellular context-dependent manner. Therefore, much more work will be necessary to identify E2F7 interacting proteins and assign specific functions to E2F7 in different cell lineages.</p><p>Importantly, both miR-26a overexpression and E2F7 inhibition produces p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> accumulation, a factor that has a crucial role in the proliferation arrest and monocytic differentiation of AML cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> We showed that the transcriptional repressor E2F7 is able to bind to p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> promoter region in proliferating AML cells; thus, sustaining the differentiation block of AML cells by inhibiting p21 <sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression. In summary, we propose a model in which the translational repression of E2F7 by miR-26a could contribute to a detachment of E2F7 from p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> promoter and, in turn, to the induction of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression during VitD3-mediated differentiation of AML cell lines. It is worth noting that just as E2F7 is just one of the hundreds of potential targets of miR-26a, p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> is just one of the downstream effectors of E2F7. Further studies will be needed to understand the relevance of this model in normal monocytopoiesis and AML.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional activity of c-Myc is inhibited by p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> c-Myc transcriptionally activates the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> containing miRNAs known to inhibit monocytic/macrophage differentiation of both normal myeloid progenitors and AML cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Moreover, increased expression of miR-17-92 has been reported in AML patients where it helps to maintain self-renewal of leukemic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Our studies showed that, in our cellular system, E2F7 contributed to control miR-17-92 expression. Indeed, E2F7 inhibition is sufficient to produce a decrease of miR-17-92. This suggests a model in which E2F7 could control miR-17-92 expression through the inhibition of c-Myc activity by p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup>. However, further experiments will be needed to clarify the relation between p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup>, c-Myc and miR-17-92 expression. Notably, the p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> mRNA is also a target of the miR-17 family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Consequently, the decreased expression of miR-17-92 might contribute to enforce p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> expression during AML cell differentiation. This indicates that upregulation of E2F7 could contribute to oncogenesis in AML by maintaining high levels of miR-17-92.</p><p>In conclusion, this study identified a novel aspect of VitD3 action in regulating proliferation and differentiation of AML cells through the miR-26a/E2F7/p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> network. However, it should be considered that the level of complexity of gene regulation during these processes is such that no single circuitry operates in isolation and they are very likely part of fully integrated networks within the cells. Therein, the biological effect of a specific miRNA strongly depends on the cellular context. In particular, miR-26a has been shown to induce proliferation arrest in different tumor model systems, such as lymphomas and liver, breast and nasopharyngeal carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Conversely, it has been shown to act as an oncogene in glioblastoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> An important aspect to consider in using miR-26a as an antitumor molecule in AML is that p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> not only has a relevant role in the proliferation arrest during differentiation of normal and pathological hematopoietic progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> but also prevents excess DNA-damage accumulation and exhaustion of cancer stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Thus, consideration should be given to the design of antitumor therapies based on miR-26a.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures and reagents</title><p>HL-60 and U937 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 &#x000d7; penicillin/streptomycin solution, 1 &#x000d7; &#x02112;-glutamine and 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum.
