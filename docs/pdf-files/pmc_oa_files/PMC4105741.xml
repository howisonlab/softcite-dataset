Previously, we successfully induced the production of lipid droplets in the free-living cultured <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> (clade B) under the nitrogen-deprivation condition for 5 days. Therefore, the present study aimed at understanding the disruption of the endosymbiotic relationship between the cnidarians and dinoflagellates by nitrogen deprivation using <italic>Aiptasia pulchella</italic> as an example. Transmission electron micrographs revealed the formation of lipid droplets induced by nitrogen deprivation, and the lipid analyses further showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids were drastically enriched in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> after 30 days of nitrogen deprivation, although these were unaffected after 5 days of nitrogen starvation. The present study also suggested that the host provided nitrogen to the symbiotic cells during short-term environmental stress. However, the relationship started to deteriorate after 30 days. These findings provide a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of the symbiotic relationship between the symbiotic dinoflagellates in terms of the nitrogen source, which might provide more information for the explanation of the regulatory mechanism underlying endosymbiotic associations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Nutrition plays an important role in supporting endosymbiosis between cnidarians and unicellular dinoflagellates, particularly <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> spp.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

To determine the localization of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells within its host, <italic>A. pulchella</italic> sections were stained with toluidine blue and observed under a light microscope. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">figure 1B</xref>, the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells were mostly nested in the gastrodermal layer, which was surrounded by the epidermal layer. To characterize the ultrastructure of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells in the host, we isolated the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells from <italic>A. pulchella</italic>. The <italic>A. pulchella</italic> was blended to release the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells from the host gastrodermal cells. The solution was loaded onto a Percoll gradient according to the method described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The interface of the 60 to 80% Percoll layer obtained most symbiotic gastrodermal cells (SGCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), which are the symbionts containing host gastroderm cells and plays important roles in the initiation and maintenance of the endosymbiosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, whereas the 80% to 100% Percoll layers only contained <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells without host cytoplasm contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells belonged to clade B (data not shown). The chloroplast was the largest organelle in the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cell, occupying a considerable volume of the cytoplasm. The chloroplast was located adjacent to the cell wall with a parallel band pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). The pyrenoid was located at the center of the cell and surrounded by a capping vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C; 1D</xref>). Previous studies have reported that lipid droplet formation was discovered in the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells in endosymbiotic associations with corals or anemones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

Light microscopy studies revealed the general distribution of symbiotic dinoflagellates in <italic>A. pulchella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Examination of the tentacles of <italic>A. pulchella</italic> showed a patchy distribution of brown <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells within the gastrodermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2B, 2E, 2H</xref>). The <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells were densely clustered as indicated by the red fluorescence light in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">figure 2 (C, F, I)</xref>. There was no difference in the cell density of the normal and 5-day-nitrogen-deprivation treatments, but the cell density decreased after 30 days of nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This significant difference was confirmed by light and flourescene microscopy, meanwhile, the tentacle started to bleach as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The 30-day nitrogen deprivation resulted in chloroplast degradation, and the reduction was 54.3% in chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> concentration compared to the normal cells (4.22 &#x000b1; 0.01 to 1.93 &#x000b1; 0.01&#x02005;pg.cell<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Fluorescence analysis performed by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry showed that the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic cells was similar in the controls and nitrogen-deprived <italic>A. pulchella</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The ultrastructural changes in symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells, <italic>A. pulchella</italic> was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Nitrogen deprivation induced significant morphological changes in the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells obtained from <italic>A. pulchella</italic>. The symbionts cultured in either enriched nutrient or nitrogen-depleted seawater for 5 days did not exhibit any obvious changes in cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3A, B, C, D</xref>). The chloroplasts, pyrenoids and starch granules appeared as major subcellular components in the cells. However, several morphological changes were found in the <italic>A. pulchella</italic> cultured in nitrogen-depleted seawater for 30 days. In addition, nitrogen deprivation induced the accumulation of lipid droplets that occupied most of the cytoplasm of the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells. The lipid droplet number significantly increased from 2 compartements per cell in the <italic>A. pulchella</italic> cells of the normal treatment to 7 in the cells treated with nitrogen deprivation for 30 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the lipid droplet size significantly increased from 0.38&#x02005;&#x000b5;m to 1.17&#x02005;&#x000b5;m in the nitrogen-deprived <italic>A. pulchella</italic>. Although most nitrogen-deprived symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells accumulated lipid droplets, there was no significant increase in cell size. However, the cell wall thickness of the nitrogen-deprived <italic>A. pulchella</italic> showed an approximate two-fold increase compared to that of the controls, from 0.02&#x02005;&#x000b5;m to 0.05&#x02005;&#x000b5;m.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nitrogen deprivation-induced lipid droplet formation and an increase in lipid content in symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic></title><p>Nitrogen deprivation in the symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets, which were isolated and the lipid content was analyzed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

Both TAGs and CEs were less detectable in the symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells cultured in the normal conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The concentration of TAGs and CEs were highest (21.77 &#x000b1; 0.08 and 5.36 &#x000b1; 0.15&#x02005;pg cell<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) after 30 days of nitrogen-deprivation. Fatty acid analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>) of normal and 5-day nitrogen deprived symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells revealed the predominance of saturated fatty acid (SFA), in which C16:0 and C18:0 were the most abundant fatty acids. Moreover, after 30 days of nitrogen deprived treatment the purified symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells demonstrated that monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (C16:1, C18:1, C22:1) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (C18:2, C22:6) were synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>. Furthermore, the fatty acid compositions of host <italic>A. pulchella</italic> cells showed that C12:0, C16:0 and C18:0 were the abundant fatty acids in normal condition. Interestingly, after nitrogen deprived treatment, the host started accumulating PUFA, however the C16:0 was still the majority fatty acid composition of the <italic>A. pulchella</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The effect of nitrogen-deprivation on the cellular morphology and protein expression of <italic>A. pulchella</italic></title><p>Nitrogen deprivation in the host not only affected the ultrastructure and lipid content of its symbiotic dinoflagellates, but also changed the cellular morphology and protein expression in the host.

Our previous study demonstrated that the increased lipid content and lipid droplet accumulation in the free living <italic>Symbidinium</italic> spp. cells were caused by nitrogen deprivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These findings were similar to that of the studies involving nutrient-starved green algae, <italic>Scenedesmus obtusiusculus</italic> and <italic>Chlorella</italic> spp.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

Therefore, the metabolic proficiency of the host plays an important role in the nutrient status of photosynthetic dinoflagellates. In this study, we have characterized the endosymbiotic relationship between the cnidarians and dinoflagellates by using <italic>A. pulchella</italic> as a study model and observed the changes in cellular morphology and lipid content in the condition of nitrogen deprivation. <italic>A. pulchella</italic> treated with the nitrogen deprived media was observed on day 5 and day 30. On day 5, the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells were isolated and purified, it was shown that no change in the endosymbiotic relationship of short- term environmental stress; however, this relationship deteriorated with the application of a long-term (30 days) environmental stress.</p><p>Nitrogen deprivation led to the synthesis of lipids and formation of lipid droplets in the symbionts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. It was shown that the symbiotic cells in the nitrogen-enriched corals contained less carbon and more nitrogen per cell than those in the nitrogen-deprived corals. A high carbon:nitrogen ratio induces an excess of photosynthetic products compared to that of protein synthesis, which results in the accumulation of starch and lipids. Our result showed that lipid droplets did not accumulate in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells during endosymbiosis with a nitrogen starvation for less than 5 days. However, lipid droplet production occurred in the free-living cultured <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells treated with the nitrogen deprivation for 5 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.

Nitrogen-starved hosts showed a decrease in metabolism. In contrast, nitrogen-starved symbiotic cells remained metabolically active due to their photosynthetic efficiency, which caused lipid droplet accumulation in the symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells. Hsp70 is routinely used as a biochemical stress indicator, as the elevated expression of Hsp70 is usually in response to environmental stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. As expected, Hsp70 showed a higher expression in the host cells cultured for 30 days in the nitrogen-deprivated seawater compared to the cells cultured without nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>A. pulchella</italic> might have up regulated its synthesis of Hsp70 in response to the nitrogen deprivation.

Variations in fatty acid concentrations were observed in the host and the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> isolated from <italic>A. pulchella</italic> under normal and nitrogen-deprived conditions. Palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) were most abundant fatty acid in the host and the symbiotic <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> isolated from <italic>A. pulchella</italic> under normal condition and 5-day nitrogen deprivation. In contrast, the main fatty acid component of TAG in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> isolated from <italic>A. pulchella</italic> cells treated with 30-day nitrogen deprivation was oleic acid (18:1). Furthermore, the host fatty acid isolated from <italic>A. pulchella</italic> treated with 30-day nitrogen deprivation was dominated by palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (18:1).
