     cells were treated by extracts of Hp11638 or Hp11638M. The ROS levels, cytochrome C reductions,
     and intracellular ATP levels were measured. The coding region and the D-Loop region were
     amplified and sequenced. Results showed the ROS levels, cytochrome C reduction and mtDNA
     mutations were markedly increased and cell viability decreased after treatment with both Hp
     extracts, and 616 mutations were detected in D-Loop region and 3 heteroplasmic point mutations
     in the Cytb gene. No mutations were found in the coding region. The mutation rates of mtDNA
     D-Loop region were positively correlated with the ROS levels and negatively to the ATP
    levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Helicobacter pylori</kwd><kwd>Reactive Oxygen Species</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>Mutation.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are Gram-negative microaerophilic bacteria. Hp infection represents a
    key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active
    gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric
    mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori-positive patients have a 10 to 20%
    lifetime risk of developing ulcer disease and a 1 to 2% risk of developing distal gastric cancer
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. The cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein and
    vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) protein are the main virulence factors of Hp and closely relevant
    with the occurrence of gastric ulcer and carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. Most
    H. pylori strains secrete VacA into the extracellular space. After exposure of VacA to acidic or
    basic pH, re-oligomerized VacA (mainly 6 monomeric units) at neutral pH is more toxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. CagA (120-145 kDa protein) is a highly anti&#x000ad;genic
    protein that is associated with a prominent inflammatory response. It has a pathogenic effect on
    gastric and duodenal mucosa leading to the development of peptic ulcers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that Hp can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and programmed
    cell death in human gastric epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. ROS are produced as a normal product of cellular metabolism
    and include superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>&#x02022;&#x002c9;), hydrogen peroxide
     (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical (HO&#x02022;), nitric oxide (NO&#x02022;),
    etc. They are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons and can
    diffuse only an extremely short distance before they dissipate. Elevated levels of ROS have been
    implicated in cellular physiological and pathological processes such as cell proliferation,
    apoptosis, differentiation, carcinogenesis, etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>.
    Mitochondria are the centre of energy metabolism in the cell and a major source of ROS. The
    proportion of oxygen converted into O<sub>2</sub>&#x02022;&#x002c9;accounts for about 1-2 %
    of the overall oxygen consumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Mitochondrial DNA
    (mtDNA) is an extranuclear genetic material. mtDNA is particularly susceptible to ROS generated
    by the respiratory chain due to its close proximity and lack of protective histones, and
    inefficient DNA repair systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>.</p><p>Evidence shows Hp VacA can activate the p38/activating transcription factor 2-mediated
    signaling pathway resulting in decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> and can induce suppression of energy metabolism followed by
    mitochondrial damage, leading to impairment of the cell cycle in gastric epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. Recent studies suggest Hp can increase the mtDNA mutation
    in AGS cells and mtDNA mutations have been found in Hp infected gastric ulcer and carcinoma
    tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>.
    However, the role of ROS in the Hp induced mtDNA mutations is still unknown and the impacts of
    VacA and CagA on the ROS production and mtDNA mutations are poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate the ROS production and mtDNA mutations in the Hp infected cells, AGS cells were
    stimulated by the extract of NCTC Hp11638 (CagA+, VacA+) or the mutant Hp11638M (CagA+, VacA-).
    The relationships between ROS and mtDNA mutations as well as mutations in D-loop were evaluated.
    Our results demonstrated the ROS levels and the amount of mtDNA mutations in cells treated by
    the extract of Hp11638 were markedly higher than those in cells treated by Hp11638 mutant
    strain. Several mutations in D-Loop region were also detected, but Cox-I, Cox-II, Cox-III,
    ATPase6 and ATPase8 genes had no mutations. Furthermore, 3 heteroplasmic point mutations were
    identified in Cytb gene and Hp induced mutations in D-Loop region were closely related to the
    bacterial virulence and the endogenous ROS level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Hp Strains</title><p>AGS cells were purchased from Shanghai Institute of Cell. NCTC Hp 11638, NCTC Hp11638M and

    developing countries, more than 80% of the population is Hp positive, even at young ages. The
    prevalence of Hp infection in industrialized countries generally remains under 40% and is
    considerably lower in children and adolescents than in adults and elderly people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. To date, the pathogenic mechanisms have not been well
    defined.</p><p>Studies have shown Hp can cause damage to mitochondria leading to the impairment of cell cycle
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. In the
    study of Machado et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, they speculate, following Hp
    infection, the activity and expression of base excision repair and mismatch repair are
    down-regulated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, Hp induces
    genomic instability in nuclear CA repeats in mice and in mtDNA of AGS cells and chronic
    gastritis tissue, and this effect in mtDNA is associated with bacterial virulence. Furthermore,
    the DNA damage induced genetic exchange may facilitate spread of antibiotic resistance and
    selection of fitter variants through re-assortment of preexisting alleles in this important
    human pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. In a letter to the editor, Lee et al
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> reveal the mtDNA mutations in peptic ulcer tissues
    associated with Hp infection occur in both the mtDNA control and coding regions. Approximately
    half of the patients had heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations.</p><p>The human mtDNA is a double stranded circular molecule of 16569 bp and contains 37 genes
    coding for two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 13 polypeptides. The mtDNA is present in high copy numbers
     (10<sup>3</sup>~10<sup>4</sup> copies per cell) in virtually all cells and the vast
    majority of copies are identical at birth. Furthermore, mtDNA is known for having high acquired
    mutation rates which are 10 times higher than that of nuclear genomic DNA. It is generally
    accepted that high mutation rates of mtDNA are contributed to the lack of protective histones,
    inefficient DNA repair systems and continuous exposure to ROS generated by oxidative
    phosphorylation in the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>.</p><p>The D-loop, which is 1124 bp in size (positions 16024-576), is a non-coding region, and acts
    as a promoter for both the heavy and light strands of the mtDNA, and contains essential
    transcription and replication elements. The D-loop region is a hot spot for mtDNA alterations
    and the nucleotide positions 16024&#x000b1;16 324 and 63&#x000b1;322 located in the D-Loop are
    termed first hypervariable region (HV1) and second hypervariable region (HV2), respectively
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. The sequence analysis of these two regions is used
    not only in forensic analysis, but also in medical diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>.</p><p>Obst et al have shown that Hp extract could induce the synthesis of ROS, diminish the levels
    of reduced glutathione (GSH), induce DNA fragmentation and increase DNA synthesis in gastric
    cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Davies et al also revealed Hp could stimulate
    the production of reactive oxygen metabolite in the antral mucosa <italic>in vivo</italic>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>. Hp can induce the production of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines from gastric epithelial cells resulting in the increased generation of ROS in gastric
    epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. It has been shown that Hp infection
    can increase the expression and activity of spermine oxidase, which oxidizes polyamines that are
    abundant in epithelial cells to release hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. In addition, study also demonstrates that Hp itself also generates ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, and administration of antioxidase or antioxidant may be
    protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, extract was obtained from VacA positive and VacA negative HP. The
    stimulation of ROS production by VacA, an important virulence factor of Hp, has been
    demonstrated in numerous studies. Kimura et al revealed VacA purified from Hp could cause
    mitochondrial damage (impair mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a decrease in energy
    metabolism) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, which may be a cause of excessive
    production of ROS. This effect was confirmed by Kim et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Furthermore, VacA from Hp could also impaired glutathione metabolism which
    alleviates the anti-oxidative potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. These effects
    result in excessive generation of ROS and compromised anti-oxidative potency. These effects may
    also explain why the ROS levels in AGS cells stimulated by Hp11638 extract were significantly
    higher than those in cells treated by Hp11638M extract at the corresponding concentrations.</p><p>Therefore, Hp infection may involve in many gastrointestinal diseases through excessive ROS
    production in the mucosa, the pronounced membrane damage, and the depletion of gastric
    anti-oxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. The ROS not only causes damage to
    nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, but compromises the DNA repair. The mismatch repair (MMR) pathway
    is an important mechanism involving in the DNA repair. Studies have shown Hp infection can
    down-regulate the expressions of MMR <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. ROS cause damage to not only nuclear DNA, but mtDNA.
    mtDNA mutations have been detected in Hp-infected chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer tissues,
    suggesting that Hp infection contributes to the accumulation of mutations in mtDNA at early
    steps of gastric cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. In the study of
    Machado et al., their results showed Hp infection resulted in increased mutations in the
    non-coding D-loop as well as the coding genes <italic>ND1</italic> and <italic>COI</italic> of
    mtDNA of gastric cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. The increase in the number of
    mutations was mainly attributed to a rise of transitions, possibly a consequence of oxidative
    damage. The increase in mtDNA mutations was dependent on the bacterial virulence factors. The
    changes in mtDNA in peptic ulcer tissues may further impair the ATP synthesis and increase the
    mtDNA copy number to compensate for the deficiency in ATP. During this perturbation,
    mitochondria might produce a large amount of ROS, causing the vicious cycle in peptic ulcer
    disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, the ROS levels and the mutations in the mtDNA of AGS cells were
    determined after Hp extract stimulation. Our results demonstrated the ROS levels and the
    frequency of mutations in the mtDNA increased and the cell viability decreased in a
    concentration and time dependent manner. In addition, the ROS levels and Luminescence levels
    were not markedly changed in the blank control and the negative control accompanied by absence
    of any mutation in the mtDNA. These findings further confirmed that the increased ROS levels and
    the elevated mutation rates as well as the decreased cell viability were caused by the Hp
    extracts. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed the ROS level was positively correlated with
    the mutation rates. Therefore, our findings support the hypothesis that Hp induced ROS was the
    main cause of mtDNA mutations.</p><p>However, the mutation rate of mtDNA in our results (7% highest) is significantly lower than
    that reported by Machado et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> which may be explained
    the following reasons. First, Machado et al applied live bacteria to stimulate AGS cells and the
    duration of stimulation was as long as 5 d, whereas stimulation by the Hp extract was conducted
    for only up to 24 h in the present study. Second, Machado et al compared the mtDNA sequence
    post-stimulation with that from database, while, in the present study, the mtDNA sequence of AGS
    cells after stimulation was compared with that at baseline which avoids the false increase in
    the mutation rate due to variance in certain loci of mtDNA between AGS cells and normal human
    cells. Although the mutation rate in the present study was lower than that reported by Machado
    et al, we still postulated there is an accumulation in the Hp extract induced mtDNA mutation.</p><p>Our results also showed that no mutations were found in the coding regions of Cox-I, Cox-II,
    Cox-III, ATPase6 and ATPase8 in the mtDNA. Only 3 heteroplasmic mutations in the Cytb gene loci
    were identified in the mtDNA of AGS cells after stimulation with 960 &#x003bc;g/ml Hp11638
    extract, which suggested that the D-Loop region is the main location where Hp induced mtDNA
    mutations occur and that the mtDNA mutation seldom takes place in the gene coding region of
    mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>.</p><p>MtDNA contains several mono- and dinucleotide repeats. The ones most frequently used to test
    mtGI are a (CA)n microsatellite starting at 514 bp position of the D-loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref> and a homopolymeric C tract extending from 16,184 to 16,193 bp of the
    D-loop, which is interrupted by a T at 16,189 bp position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. In human populations, the mtCA microsatellite shows seven different alleles varying
    in size by one repeat. On the other hand, the (16184)C homopolymer exhibits two forms: the
    stable one in which all mt-genomes of an individual have equal-length tracts (usually 10 bp
    long) and the unstable one in which the mt-genomes of a given individual are a mosaic of C
    tracts varying in length from 8 to 14 nucleotides. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the
    mechanism of length variation shows that a T&#x02192;C transition in the T nucleotide at 16189
    bp position is the primary cause of instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. In
    our study, mutations were found in 17 out of 20 samples after stimulation by Hp extracts and
    included C deletion in the 303PolyC region, CA deletion in the D514CA repeats and T&#x02192;C
    replacement at the 16189 bp position of 16184PolyC. Previous studies have found that most of
    mtDNA mutations are T&#x02192;C; G&#x02192;A replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. In this study, 616 mutations were
    identified in the D-Loop region of mtDNA, including 489 point mutations, 81 insertions and 46
    deletions, and 89.4% of point mutations (437/489) were G &#x02192; A; C&#x02192;T and A
    &#x02192; G; T&#x02192;C conversion.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Hp extracts can induce the production of
    intracellular ROS, which may be the primary cause of mtDNA mutations. In addition, mtDNA
    mutation results in the reduction of ATP synthesized in mitochondria and affect cell viability.
    Both the pathogenic factors of Hp (VacA and CagA), especially the VacA, play an important role
    in the Hp induced mtDNA mutation. We speculate that the accumulation of Hp induced mtDNA
    mutation is likely to be one of critical mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of
   Hp.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (No. 08411968100).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
