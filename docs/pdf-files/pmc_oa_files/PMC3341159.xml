The type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a and K6b) are among the genes induced early on in wound-proximal keratinocytes and maintained during reepithelialization. Paradoxically, genetic ablation of K6a and K6b results in enhanced keratinocyte migration.

Endogenous Src physically associated with keratin proteins in keratinocytes in a K6-dependent fashion. Purified Src bound K6-containing filaments via its SH2 domain in a novel phosphorylation-independent manner, resulting in kinase inhibition. K6 protein was enriched in the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM), a key site of Src inhibition, and DRMs from K6-null keratinocytes were depleted of both keratin and Src.

Similarities have been noted between healing wounds and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dvorak, 1986</xref>), and key genes expressed during wound healing and in cancer share transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dauer et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, wounding hastens skin carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DePianto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong and Reiter, 2011</xref>). Defining the mechanisms regulating the amplitude and duration of normal tissue repair events may shed light on what goes awry in tumors, in chronic nonhealing wounds, and related disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Djalilian et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a and K6b) and their partner type I keratins 16 and 17 (K16 and K17) are rapidly induced in wound-proximal epidermal keratinocytes after skin injury and in chronic disease settings (e.g., psoriasis and cancer) in addition to being normally expressed in epithelial appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansbridge and Knapp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paladini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGowan and Coulombe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>). Mice null for K6a/K6b die within a week after birth, correlating with severe oral blistering secondary to fragility in the filiform papillae, an epithelial appendage of the dorsal tongue epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). Skin grafting showed that K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes, which also exhibit reduced K16 levels owing to enhanced turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernot et al., 2005</xref>), are mechanically compromised and readily rupture while attempting to migrate into the setting of acute skin wounds in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>). In skin explant culture, a setting in which frictional forces are lesser but otherwise very relevant to wound epithelialization in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazzalupo et al., 2002</xref>), K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes maintain their integrity and actually migrate markedly faster than wild type (WT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>). Of note, changes in the expression and/or regulation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins is a common occurrence after injury to various tissues including muscle and central nervous system, and, otherwise, IF proteins have been shown to impact the migration of several types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coulombe and Wong, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Select phosphotyrosine epitopes that positively react with the widely used mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 are enriched in cell lysates prepared from cultured K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> skin explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>), including a protein of 60-kD M<sub>r</sub>, the correct size for Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase with an established role in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun-Gultekin and Wagner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 1996</xref>). Src is activated in wound settings as well as in psoriatic and neoplastic skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayli et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that K6 normally functions to dampen Src signaling in wound-activated keratinocytes and that the loss of K6 leads to unimpeded Src activation and enhanced keratinocyte migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Building on previous findings involving a skin explant culture assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>), we find that K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> skin keratinocytes in primary culture show enhanced migration after scratch wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and in transwell migration assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201107078/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Therefore, this phenotype is very robust and represents an intrinsic property of K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes. The intracellular organization of keratin filaments appears normal in the absence of K6 (Fig. S1 B). The 4G10 antibody used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>) reacts with in vitro activated Src and immunoprecipitates Src and FAK from mouse skin keratinocytes (in a complex and/or individually; see Fig. S1, C and D). Collectively, the cell-autonomous enhancement in migration potential, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 60-kD protein, and the largely intact organization of keratin filaments prompted us to assess the role of Src kinase in migrating K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of K6 leads to SFK activation in wound-induced keratinocytes.</bold> (A) Migration of keratinocytes in scratch wounds.

In contrast, SFK activity level was normal in lysates prepared from K14<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or K17<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 B</xref> and S1 E), which show WT-like migration (not depicted). Key Src substrates with defined roles in cell migration (e.g., FAK, P130Cas, and paxillin) showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation on Src-regulated sites in K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> but not in K14<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or K17<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). By immunostaining, activated Src/SFK epitopes concentrate at the leading edge of K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>; quantified in Fig. S1 F), a pattern known to favor epithelial cell migration during corneal wound closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2004</xref>). Migration of WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes was markedly inhibited by treatment of skin explants with the Src inhibitor PP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanke et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting a requirement for Src activity in this setting (Fig. S1 G). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from wound edge tissue in WT mouse skin showed that Src activation, as well as FAK and Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phosphorylation, is robustly enhanced relative to intact skin tissue away from the wound (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201107078/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). K6 and K17 are induced at the total protein level, whereas K5 levels remained fairly constant, in this setting (Fig. S2, A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paladini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGowan and Coulombe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>). By immunostaining, activated Src occurs in K6-expressing epidermal keratinocytes, both in cells actively migrating into the wound bed (Fig. S2 B) or located behind the migrating front (not depicted), in wounded WT mouse skin. Activated Src shows a distinct staining pattern in many infiltrating, actively migrating keratinocytes that conveys its membrane proximity (Fig. S2 C, arrows). Together, our ex vivo and in vivo findings on SFKs and key Src substrates with a defined role in cell motility strongly suggest that the migratory phenotype occurring in K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes involves an increase in Src activity.</p><p>Immunostaining also shows that activated Src is concentrated at focal adhesions in keratinocyte cultures from both genotypes, as inferred from comparing its localization with that of vinculin at the outer edge of cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201107078/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3</ext-link>, arrows). Likewise, phosphorylated CAS, FAK, and paxillin all localized to vinculin-containing structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S3 [arrows]) in WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Further, all of these markers were markedly redistributed in many K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes, generating a striking pattern of closely aligned dots delineating the outer cell membrane (bordering; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S3 [arrowheads]). This contrasts with WT cells, in which activated Src staining formed a corrugated cellular outline, and its substrates were concentrated in physically well-separated protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 D</xref> and S3). Thus, loss of K6 may also lead to a change in focal adhesion character that helps stimulate keratinocyte migration. Support for this notion comes from a large body of literature implicating Src-related focal adhesion turnover as a potent stimulator of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fincham and Frame, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frame et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assessed whether Src physically associates with keratins, as this would provide a potential causal link between the loss of K6 and increased Src activity. Keratin proteins indeed coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Src from skin keratinocytes in primary culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This interaction was dependent on K6, as conveyed by parallel coimmunoprecipitation assays from K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In vitro, purified His-tagged human Src protein (full-length [FL] Src protein) efficiently cosedimented with assembled K6/K17 filaments reconstituted from pure human recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Such cosedimentation reflects genuine keratin binding, as the C-terminal catalytic domain (CD) of Src (Src CD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) pellets poorly in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). In vitro activated Src also readily cosedimented with K6/K17 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Far-Western assays revealed that purified Src preferentially binds type II keratins (K5 and K6) and the type III IF vimentin, relative to type I keratins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This trend is enhanced when using preactivated Src as the ligand, as binding to K6 and vimentin remains strong compared with K5 or type I keratins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Confocal microscopy was used to relate the distribution of endogenous Src and transfected GFP-tagged keratin in nonmigrating WT keratinocytes in conventional primary culture. Both proteins showed a broad, pan-cytoplasmic distribution and partially colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitation of Src and keratin from WT skin wounds in situ proved difficult as a result of the relatively small amount of activated K6/K17-expressing keratinocytes compared with other cell types (e.g., inflammatory cells and dermal fibroblasts), cellular debris, and the protein-rich scab. As an alternative, we used TPA (12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) treatment of mouse ear to induce both K6 expression and Src activation in epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xian et al., 1997</xref>). Keratins coimmunoprecipitated with Src in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). These data establish that Src directly binds keratins and that K6, in particular, shows a consistently higher affinity for Src kinase whether it is active or not.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Src binds keratin filaments directly.</bold> (A) Coimmunoprecipitation (IP) of Src and keratin from primary cultures of WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes.

Src comprises three major domains: SH3, SH2, and the CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Src&#x02019;s CD interacts poorly with keratin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). In contrast, a His-GFP-Src N-terminal fusion comprising the SH3 and SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) showed full binding to keratin IFs in cosedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Upon further dissection, the SH2 domain (residues 149&#x02013;254) mediated strong binding to keratin IFs in copelleting assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and exhibited a higher affinity for type II keratins in Far-Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The SH3 domain did not bind keratin in either assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Direct binding to Src&#x02019;s SH2 domain does not involve phosphorylated tyrosine residues on keratins, given their recombinant bacterial source, implying that it is mediated by a novel binding determinant. A motif homologous to type I keratins has been recognized in this specific region of Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tachibana et al., 1988</xref>), and this could account for its greater affinity for type II keratins.</p><p>Src autophosphorylation is significantly hindered when it is equilibrated with K6/K17 filaments before activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>; quantitation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In contrast, autophosphorylation and activation of Src&#x02019;s CD were minimally altered by the presence of K6/K17 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>), conveying that the degree of kinase inhibition achieved is proportional to the affinity of Src for keratin IFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). These in vitro findings suggest that the binding of Src to K6 might negatively regulate its kinase activity in WT keratinocytes in vivo.</p><p>Cell migration is a highly spatially organized process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin, 1997</xref>), raising the prospect that the keratin&#x02013;Src interaction may be segregated to a specialized subcellular compartment at or near the membrane. We focused on detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) as a location of interest as a result of its established role as a key site of Src regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oneyama et al., 2008</xref>). Upon activation, Src is recruited to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (which are resistant to Triton X-100 extraction), where it phosphorylates C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)&#x02013;binding protein (CBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawabuchi et al., 2000</xref>). CSK is then recruited and inactivates Src via phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oneyama et al., 2008</xref>). Keratin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caruso and Stemmer, 2011</xref>) and vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2009</xref>) IF proteins have been found in DRMs. Likewise, we identified a fraction of the keratin pool, including K5, K6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), K14, and K17 (not depicted) as well as Src itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), in DRM fractions from WT skin explant lysates. In contrast, lysates from K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes showed reduced levels of keratin and Src in DRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Two phosphorylated forms of Src also localized to DRM fractions in both WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> explant lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Consistent with our model, there was no difference in the amount of pY527 (inhibited) SFK epitopes in DRM fractions from WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes, whereas there was a clear reduction in p-Y416 (activated) epitopes in K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). In contrast, FAK, phospho-FAK, phospho-CAS, and phospho-paxillin do not occur in DRM fractions in either genotype (unpublished data). Such findings argue that the localization of Src to DRMs may be distinct from its recruitment to focal adhesions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Keratins and Src are enriched in DRM fractions in a K6-dependent fashion.</bold> (A) DRMs obtained from WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes in explant cultures.

All DRM experiments have been repeated three times with similar results. Migration of mass standards is given in kilodaltons. (E) Schematic depiction of the mechanism of Src regulation in wound-activated keratinocytes without (left) and with (right) a keratin-dependent step. Canonically, Src is regulated by an on/off switch, with activation (asterisks) by exposure to growth factors (GF) and/or activated integrins followed by translocation to DRMs and inhibition via interaction with CSK and CBP. Src reactivation requires translocation out of DRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guarino, 2010</xref>). We propose that a keratin-binding step within DRMs delays Src exit from rafts, thereby moderating the pool of Src available for reactivation by relevant stimuli. Note that the sequence with which Src interacts with CBP, CSK, and K6 (and other entities in DRMs) is unknown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201107078_Fig4"/></fig><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that in addition to its previously defined structural support role in wound-proximal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>), K6 (and potentially its partner K16) participates in the regulation and optimization of epithelial migration by dynamically binding to Src. The canonical view of Src regulation involves an on/off switch, with inactivation taking place within DRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oneyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guarino, 2010</xref>). Based on the findings reported here, we propose that a direct interaction between Src and K6 and perhaps other proteins results in a prolonged sequestration of Src in DRMs of wound-activated WT skin keratinocytes, thus delaying its reactivation and dampening its overall activity at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>).</p><p>Mouse keratinocytes null for the keratin-binding proteins epiplakin, plakophilin, or plectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">South et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006</xref>) or the keratin-associated plakoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2005</xref>) all exhibit enhanced migration phenotypes. Furthermore, ablation of plectin or plakoglobin robustly activates SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Todorovi&#x00107; et al., 2010</xref>). Plakoglobin, in particular, is a known Src target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miravet et al., 2003</xref>) and reacts with the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (unpublished data). The molecular mass of plakoglobin (&#x0223c;80 kD) corresponds to a tyrosine-phosphorylated epitope that is elevated in lysates from migrating K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>). Others have recently shown that plakoglobin and other desmosomal proteins are enriched in DRM fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennan et al., 2011</xref>), as we observed in WT and K6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse keratinocytes (unpublished data). These findings raise the distinct possibility of plakoglobin&#x02019;s contribution, perhaps in conjunction with other keratin-binding proteins (e.g., plectin) to the recruitment of keratin proteins to lipid rafts and/or to regulation of Src in migrating keratinocytes.</p><p>Cells likely possess mechanisms guarding them against the negative consequences of excessive Src activity, which, in settings such as tissue repair, is promoted by numerous growth factors, activated integrins, and other stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin, 1997</xref>). High Src activity is a powerful inducer of epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 1993</xref>) and also is a recurring characteristic of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bild et al., 2006</xref>). K6 is also commonly induced in carcinomas affecting skin and related complex epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moll et al., 1983</xref>); intriguingly, loss of K6 expression correlates with a more aggressive behavior in endometrial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stefansson et al., 2006</xref>) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larcher et al., 1992</xref>). Although the role of K6 in tumor settings has not been defined, we speculate that its ability to bind and regulate Src represents a protective mechanism that maintains epithelial tumors in a more differentiated, less aggressive state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mouse lines</title><p>All experiments involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
