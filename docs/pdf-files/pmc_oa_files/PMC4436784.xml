Here we describe a new SR fluorescence microscope based on confocal microscope optics, which we name the spinning disk superresolution microscope (SDSRM). Theoretically, the SDSRM is equivalent to a structured illumination microscope (SIM) and achieves a spatial resolution of 120 nm, double that of the diffraction limit of wide-field fluorescence microscopy. However, the SDSRM is 10 times faster than a conventional SIM because SR signals are recovered by optical demodulation through the stripe pattern of the disk. Therefore a single SR image requires only a single averaged image through the rotating disk. On the basis of this theory, we modified a commercial spinning disk confocal microscope. The improved resolution around 120 nm was confirmed with biological samples. The rapid dynamics of micro&#x000ad;tubules, mitochondria, lysosomes, and endosomes were observed with temporal resolutions of 30&#x02013;100 frames/s. Because our method requires only small optical modifications, it will enable an easy upgrade from an existing spinning disk confocal to a SR microscope for live-cell imaging.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy is now an essential tool for the cell biologist. However, most subcellular structures are &#x0003c;200 nm and blurred by diffraction (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbe, 1873</xref>). Superresolution (SR) techniques, such as photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Betzig <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Rust <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>), can extend the resolution down to &#x02264;50 nm, but usually at the expense of image acquisition time. Therefore their applications are rather limited to fixed specimens. In living cells, some cellular structures, such as endosomes and other vesicles, move at velocities &#x0003e;3 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Allen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1982</xref>). Thus the image acquisition time needs to be &#x0003c;&#x0003c;30 ms for 100-nm-resolution imaging.</p><p>From this viewpoint, PALM and STORM are not suitable for observing the rapid dynamics of subcellular structures in living cells because they reconstruct a single SR image from at least thousands of raw images, requiring &#x0003e;10 s of imaging for a single frame. STED can be accelerated, but faster image acquisition requires orders of magnitude stronger illumination than conventional imaging, which risks photodamage. As a result, the practical limit of STED image acquisition time is longer than a few microseconds/pixel, meaning 10 s for a 1024 &#x000d7; 1024&#x02013;pixel field of view (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A third SR technique, structured illumination microscopy (SIM; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Heintzmann and Cremer, 1999</xref>), can extend the resolution to 120 nm, twice the resolving power of conventional wide-field (WF) microscopy. Although its resolution is worse than that of the other two techniques, SIM can achieve faster frame rates with little photodamage and relatively easy multicolor imaging. One study reported a frame rate up to 11 Hz (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Kner <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, this may be the best achievable frame rate because SIM requires 9&#x02013;15 raw images to reconstruct a single SR image. A related technique, multifocal structured illumination microscopy (MSIM; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">York <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), a parallelized form of image scanning microscopy (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 1988</xref>), generates an image with &#x0223c;150-nm resolution at &#x0223c;1-Hz frame rate. Recently an improved implementation of MSIM, termed instant SIM, was reported (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">York <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A 100-Hz frame rate with &#x0223c;150-nm resolution was achieved by using several optical elements, such as two sets of microlens array and pinhole array; however, expertise is required to align all these optical elements correctly.</p><p>Here we report another implementation of SIM using spinning disk confocal microscope optics, which we named the spinning disk superresolution microscope (SDSRM). We demonstrate that the commercial spinning disk confocal microscope can be upgraded into a SR microscope simply by replacing the disk. It can achieve the same resolution as SIM, 120 nm, but with a frame rate of 10 ms/frame. This is the fastest frame rate reported for SR imaging (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">York <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and is fast enough to image fine structures in living cells moving at up to 6 &#x003bc;m/s.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Principle of SDSRM</title><p>The basic principle of our SR method is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and fully discussed in Supplemental Text 1. Here we use a one-dimensional model and omit the magnification of the imaging system for simplicity. In WF microscopy, the sample is illuminated homogeneously, and the image contains only the signals within the cut-off frequency of the optical system (<italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub>), which determines the diffraction limit of the resolution. In conventional SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), a raw image is taken with illumination modulated sinusoidally. SR signals&#x02014;namely, the signals of the structure beyond <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub>&#x02014;are overlaid as Moir&#x000e9; interference patterns with a frequency shift by <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>, the spatial frequency of the sinusoidal illumination pattern. The SR signals are demodulated by digital processing using three raw images taken with illumination patterns phase shifted by 120&#x000b0; each. Thus the cut-off frequency of SIM is extended to <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub> + <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>. Usually, the same objective lens is used for imaging and illumination, so that <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> can be designed up to <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub> (<italic>f<sub>0</sub></italic> &#x02264; <italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic>). Hence, <italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic> + <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x02264; 2<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic>. Namely, at most twice-better resolution can be achieved with SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1C</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1A).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Principles of SIM and SDSRM. (A, B) Schematic comparison of SIM and SDSRM.

(E) With SDSRM, the stripe pattern is designed to increase the SR component (red), and the digital high-pass filter (purple) further enhances the SR component (blue). See Supplemental Figures S1 and S2 for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743fig1"/></fig><p>In SDSRM, a stripe pattern with opening width <italic>w</italic> and period <italic>p</italic> is used as a modulator for illumination and demodulator for detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The stripe pattern is shifted continuously, and the image is integrated on the camera. Thus the same confocal mask pattern serves as both modulator and demodulator, and frequency-shifted SR signals are already returned to the original position optically. Although this optical configuration is the same as the conventional line confocal (CF) microscope, the design of the stripe pattern is different. In conventional CF, <italic>p</italic> is much larger than <italic>w</italic> to minimize cross-talk (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Shimozawa <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Therefore the amplitude of the SR signals is much weaker than the WF signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1B) because it is proportional to (<italic>p</italic>/<italic>w</italic>) sin<sup>2</sup>[(<italic>w</italic>/<italic>p</italic>)&#x003c0;] (Supplemental Text 1). Thus the effective cut-off frequency (<italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub>&#x02032;) of CF is limited to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1743uequ5.jpg"/></inline-formula>, meaning only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1743uequ6.jpg"/></inline-formula>-fold increase in resolution (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 1988</xref>). SR signals between <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub>&#x02032; and <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub> + <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> are buried in the noise and need statistical estimation for recovery with an algorithm such as Richardson&#x02013;Lucy deconvolution (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">York <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Instead, we designed the stripe pattern as <italic>w</italic> = 80 nm and <italic>p</italic> = 270 nm on the sample plane to increase the SR signals. This para&#x000ad;meter is close to the theoretical maximum (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>p</italic> = 0.35) and increases the SR signal more than five times the conventional CF stripe pattern. Furthermore, we designed a digital high-pass filter to further enhance the SR signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, Supplemental Text 2, and Supplemental Figure S2). Thus we can recover an image with fully double the resolution from a single raw image of line CF with the designed stripe pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Instrumentation of SDSRM</title><p>On the basis of this principle, we modified a spinning disk microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The disk, light source, projection lens, and camera were changed from the commercial system.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Configurations for the SDSRM. (A) System diagram. Excitation light from a mercury lamp or a laser is introduced into the illumination port of a disk-scanning unit (IX2-DSU; Olympus) attached to a microscope base (IX81; Olympus). The disk-scanning unit has a retractable spinning disk and a six-position wheel for filter sets. The spinning disk is rotated at 1800 rpm. Slit patterns are drawn by electron lithography. The intermediate image that passes through the disk is projected onto the image sensor of the camera. (B, C) The pattern drawn on the spinning disk.

The slit orientation is modified to avoid stripe pattern artifacts caused by overlap in the stripe orientation and disk rotation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743fig2"/></fig><p>For the scan head, we used the disk scanning unit (DSU; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), whose disk is easy to replace. The stripe pattern of the disk was designed to match the condition discussed. Here <italic>w</italic> and <italic>p</italic> are 500 nm and 5 &#x003bc;m on the sample plane, respectively, with the commercial DSU for 60&#x000d7;/numerical aperture (NA) 1.4 objectives. Both <italic>w</italic> and <italic>p</italic> were narrowed to 80 and 270 nm on the sample plane when projected through a 60&#x000d7; objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). This custom-designed disk was made by using electron lithography on a low-reflection chrome coat that covered a fused silica substrate (DU-DSR1-SP; Prototype Development Division, Olympus).</p><p>The Olympus DSU system normally uses a mercury lamp as the illumination, but the light throughput for the illumination is only 14% with our custom-designed disk mainly due to the opening ratio and the diffraction efficiency of the disk pattern. We therefore replaced the light source with a laser (488 nm, 500 mW; Sapphire 488HP; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). The laser beam was expanded with a lens to fill the aperture, and the speckle noise was removed by a rotating diffuser (light stirrer; NANDN, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>The image was projected onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) or an sCMOS camera (ORCA FLASH 4.0v2; Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan) via a magnifier to satisfy the Nyquist condition for up to 100-nm resolution. The SR components in the raw image were amplified by Fourier-space filtering using the Custom Filter command of ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The filter (Supplemental Figure S2E) was designed as discussed in Supplemental Text 2.</p><p>The resolution of the system was confirmed using latex beads (Supplemental Figure S3). In our hands, a backilluminated electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXon897; Andor, Belfast, United Kingdom) failed to extend the resolution even after the digital filtering. The SR components seemed to be weakened through the potential cross-talk between the adjacent pixels.</p></sec><sec><title>Proof-of-principle experiments with a low-NA objective</title><p>As a proof-of-principle experiment, we examined a microtubule sample under four conditions: conventional WF with NA 0.5 objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>), CF with the same NA 0.5 objective followed by deconvolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>), SDSRM with the same NA 0.5 objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, G&#x02013;I</xref>) and conventional WF with NA 0.95 objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, J&#x02013;L</xref>).

Nonetheless, the image obtained by the SDSRM with the NA 0.5 objective was essentially the same as the image obtained by conventional WF with the NA 0.95 objective, indicating that the SDSRM is a real SR, which improves resolution by a factor of &#x0223c;2 compared with conventional WF. Note that deconvolution of the CF image did improve resolution over WF but failed to achieve full 2&#x000d7; resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>).

A pair of microtubules with 250-nm distance was not separated in the conventional WF image but was clearly separated with the SDSRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Next we tried a faster frame rate by replacing the camera with sCMOS camera (ORCA FLASH 4.0v2), which can achieve a frame rate up to 100 frames/s, faster than the video rate. A silicone oil immersion objective lens (UPLSAPO60XS, NA1.3; Olympus) was used to minimize the spherical aberrations by the refraction index mismatch.</p><p>As the proof of principle of fast SR imaging, we chose endosomes and lysosomes, which are known to be highly dynamic.

The dynamics of lysosomes was observed with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1)&#x02013;EYFP. The images were taken with 20-ms exposure. A 100-ms-interval time series of two lysosomes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.

Conventional SIM requires several modulated images to retrieve SR components by demodulation in the Fourier space, but it has higher photon efficiency because the signal is retrieved without a mask. In contrast, the confocal aperture works as a mask to demodulate the SR components in the confocal microscope. To obtain stronger SR component signals, a smaller confocal aperture is required. However, this comes at the expense of signal intensity because with a smaller confocal aperture, most of the photons from the sample are rejected at the confocal aperture. Here we overcome this problem by specially designing the mask pattern on the disk. The opening was narrowed to &#x003bb;/5 while keeping the aperture ratio as 30%. This aperture ratio is more than three times higher than for the conventional spinning disk confocal, and this high light throughput enabled 100-Hz SR imaging with moderate excitation power (20&#x02013;40 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). Owing to this high aperture ratio, however, the optical sectioning capability is compromised. The stray light from the out-of-the-focus specimen cannot be rejected efficiently, and the axial resolution is close to that of conventional WF imaging. The axial resolution can be enhanced by reducing the aperture ratio but at the expense of light throughput or signal intensity. A longer exposure time would be required.</p><p>Even with the high-light-throughput disk pattern, stronger excitation light was required than for typical fluorescence live-cell imaging. Twice-better resolution in two dimensions means one-fourth signal intensity per pixel, and only 30% of the signal passes through the disk to reach the camera. Thus an at least 12-times stronger signal is required. Furthermore, even higher signal-to-noise ratio is required than for conventional WF imaging because the weak SR components are enhanced by high-pass filtering, which can also enhance the noise. In this study, therefore, most of the images were acquired with excitation light intensity of 20&#x02013;40 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is nearly 100 times stronger than for typical fluorescence live-cell imaging (0.1&#x02013;1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). Note, however, that this excitation beam light intensity is comparable to that for typical SIM imaging and &#x0003e;100 times weaker than for STED. Furthermore, the excitation light intensity can be further reduced for light-sensitive samples by elongating the exposure time, although the temporal resolution is compromised.</p><p>As applications of live-cell SR imaging, we observed the dynamics of microtubules, lysosomes, recycling endosomes, and mitochondria. The short exposure time (&#x0003c;30 ms) enabled SR live imaging without motion blur, and the fine structures of rapidly moving organelles were captured, such as the fusion and fission events of the outer membrane of mitochondria and the rapid dynamics of mitochondrial protrusions and MDVs. To our knowledge, this is the first visualization of MDV formation from mitochondrial protrusions. The frame rate of our system is mainly limited by the rotation speed of the disk (1800 rpm), which would be possible to accelerate 10 times to achieve a frame rate of 1 kHz. This would enable imaging of rapid processes such as neurotransmitter release at the synapse (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000fc;dhof, 2013</xref>)</p><p>In summary, the spinning disk confocal-based implementation of SIM described here is easy to implement and robust to use. An existing spinning disk confocal can easily be upgraded. Thus we hope that this method will not only open the way for SR live-cell imaging with high temporal resolution, but also help to popularize SR microscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microscopy setup for SDSRM</title><p>The microscope setup for SDSRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) is based on the disk-scanning confocal microscope system, which includes an inverted microscope base (IX81; Olympus) and a disk-scanning unit (IX2-DSU; Olympus). A combination of a cooled CCD (CoolSNAP HQ) and a mercury lamp with a light guide (U-HGLGPS, Olympus; not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) was used for the initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and Supplemental Figure S3). The light source was then replaced with a laser (Sapphire488HP; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) and a square-core fiber (ST175SQE(12); Mitsubishi Cable, Tokyo, Japan) with a vibrating motor (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; used for images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) or a single-mode fiber (kineFLEX; Qioptiq, Asslar, Germany) with a rotating diffuser (light stirrer; NANDN; used for images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5 F6 F7 F8">Figures 5&#x02013;8</xref>). Finally, the CCD camera was replaced with an sCMOS camera (ORCA FLASH 4.0v2) for faster frame rates (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5 F6 F7 F8">Figures 5&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>The disk-scanning unit has a spinning disk and a filter-set wheel changer. The spinning disk is put on the primary image plane for confocal imaging. The disk was made by using electron lithography on a low-reflection chrome coat that covered a fused silica substrate (DU-DSR1-SP; Olympus). The width and the pitch of the confocal slit apertures were 80 and 270 nm, respectively, as discussed in the main text.</p><p>For comparisons with WF, the disk was removed and a neutral density filter with a transmission factor of 6% (ND6) was put into the illumination path to adjust the image brightness. The image was projected onto the camera via a 5&#x000d7; magnifier and taken by 2 &#x000d7; 2 binning mode. Thus the pixel size of the specimen is 43 nm with a 60&#x000d7; objective lens, satisfying the Nyquist condition for up to 100-nm resolution. The software package MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to control the system and for acquisition of the image.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>The cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were grown on glass coverslips (No. 1S; Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) for immunofluorescence staining. For live imaging, cells were transfected with TransFectin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and plated onto a glass-bottom dish (No. 1.5; MatTek, Ashland, MA). The medium was changed to L15 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum but without phenol red (Life Technologies) before imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>For microtubule staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and 4% sucrose, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V; Roche, Schweiz, Switzerland) before staining with anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-tubulin antibody (MAB3408; EMD-Millipore, Billerica, MA) and Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled secondary antibody (Life Technologies). For mitochondrial staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), the cells were fixed with cold methanol (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C) and stained with anti-TOMM20 antibody (ab56783; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), followed by Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled secondary antibody. The stained cells were mounted with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>STED imaging</title><p>For confirmation of the subdiffraction structures, some samples were observed with an STED microscope system (SP8-STED 3X; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with the following settings. The acousto-optic tunable filter was 3% for 480 nm (excitation) and 95% for 592 nm (depletion). The gate for the detector was opened from 1.5 to 6 ns after the excitation pulse. The sample was scanned at 400 Hz with 8&#x000d7; line averaging. The pinhole was closed to 68 &#x003bc;m (0.5 Airy unit at 520 nm).</p></sec></sec>
