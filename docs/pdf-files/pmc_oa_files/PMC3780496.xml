of community pharmacy practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> An article by Saari et al. demonstrates that
poor job satisfaction is directly associated with performance, especially for
professionals like pharmacists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> These
performance problems can include incorrectly filling prescriptions, not detecting
drug interactions and poor patient counseling. Thus, dissatisfaction may also affect
the way that patients view the pharmacist and patients may then be inclined limit
their interactions with the pharmacist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> It is
important to realize that a decrease in pharmacist performance could cause patient
harm or even death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></p><p>If a pharmacist is dissatisfied with his/her career, there is a potential for
increased job turnover.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Pharmacists job satisfaction has been found to be negatively
associated with job turnover<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, that is
pharmacists with low levels job of satisfaction are more likely to resign their
positions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Pharmacist job satisfaction
does not only affect the pharmacist at his/her workplace, but has the potential to
affect many other aspects of his/her pharmacist life. Research suggests that there
is a strong link between job satisfaction and overall life satisfaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> If a pharmacist is not satisfied with his/her
work he/she may bring those ill feelings from their job home and allow them to
affect his/her life outside of the work place.</p><p>There are limited preliminary studies exploring aspects that impact community
pharmacists job satisfaction and most of current evidence has been conducted in
hospital settings. National surveys of community pharmacists show that perceived
workload, and information technologies may have an effect on job satisfaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> In addition, continuing pharmacy education
and preceptorship have been identified to be significant predictors of career and
job satisfaction among community pharmacists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> Other factors that have been
shown to affect job satisfaction are treatment by management<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> and other
interpersonal interactions including patient contact and coworkers
relationships<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, compensation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, pharmacy ownership4, and practice
setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> Community and
chain pharmacists were found to be less satisfied with their jobs than pharmacists
in other settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> The effect of
demographic characteristics such age, sex, and education level on community
pharmacist job satisfaction is still contradictory in the published literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></p><p>Most of the studies examining the factors affecting job satisfaction for community
pharmacists have used instruments developed, validated and used in hospital
settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, which may not capture factors
within the realm of community pharmacy. Additionally, previous studies have measured
satisfaction with single-item or a limited number of Likert type rating scales
within larger studies that assess general aspects of pharmacy worklife<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> and thus they may not capture the different
traits of the job satisfaction multidimensional construct. Finally, some studies
have adapted instruments from other settings to measure community pharmacy facets
not assessed with available standardized tools.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> However these
studies used narrow population samples, thus more evidenced is needed to support
validity of such instruments in community pharmacy.</p><p>Using the Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire of job satisfaction, the objectives of this
study are to: (1) obtain pilot data concerning the job satisfaction of Tucson area
retail chain setting; 2) identify the facets of community practice that have the
greatest contribution to job satisfaction; and 3) investigate the validity and
reliability of the Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire within a US community pharmacy study
sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>This investigation involved an anonymous cross-sectional study of chain
pharmacists in the Tucson area. A comprehensive list of all chain pharmacies in
the Tucson area, including Oro Valley and Marana, was compiled from online lists
of stores obtained from each respective chain's website. There were 129
chain community pharmacies within this geographical area, all of which were
included in questionnaire distribution. Each of the chain community pharmacies
were faxed a questionnaire and cover letter a total of three times with
approximately one month between distribution waves. Each store was sent one copy
of the questionnaire and a cover letter explaining the study during each wave.
The cover letter explained study goals, intent of the investigators, information
about anonymity and included instructions on how to return the questionnaire
(i.e. fax number). The cover letter also included a web address where the survey
was available online. The cover letter encouraged all pharmacists working at
each pharmacy to complete the survey. The store was responsible for making
enough copies so that each pharmacist could complete his or her own survey.
Responses were faxed back to a phone number that put the response directly into
an email account. Received data were introduced into an Excel spreadsheet for
analysis. This project was approved by the IRB at the University of Arizona.</p></sec><sec><title>Instrumentation</title><p>The questionnaire used for this study consisted of nine questions regarding job
satisfaction and eleven questions regarding pharmacist demographics. The nine
questions regarding job satisfaction were taken from the Warr-Cook-Wall scale
job satisfaction questionnaire modified version<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> that includes a "patient interaction" item and were
used to evaluate pharmacists' satisfaction with their current position. All
nine items measured job satisfaction using a 4 point Likert-scale with response
options "very satisfied", "satisfied", "somewhat
satisfied," and "not at all satisfied". Although the original
scale measure satisfaction in a 7-point scale, a 4-point scale was used to
decrease misinterpretation and mid-point selection. In previous studies in
United Kingdom and New Zealand community pharmacists, the Warr-Cook-Wall job
satisfaction scale obtained a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.90.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></p><p>Pharmacists were asked what type of degree they held, the number of years of
experience they had in pharmacy practice, and whether they had outside community
pharmacy experience. Pharmacist were also asked five questions related to
pharmacists work status: 1) type of chain pharmacy at which they were employed;
2) number of work hours worked per week; 3) the length of their longest work day
(in hours); 4) average number of prescriptions filled per week; 5) if he/she is
the pharmacists in charge; and 6) availability of patient services at their
pharmacy. The inclusion of these questions was based on previous research on job
satisfaction in community pharmacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>We used Rasch analysis to assess the validity and reliability of the
questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> The general
consensus on the minimum sample size for Rasch analyses is 30 subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> In Rasch analysis two types of fit
statistics are used to assess how well the model fit the empirical data: Infit
and Outfit for items mean squares (MNSQ). Infit MNSQ is an index weighted by the
difference between persons' ability and item difficulty, which makes it
more sensitive to unexpected responses. Outfit MNSQ is an unweighted index more
sensitive to extreme responses. High infit and outfit (underfit) reflect lack of
predictability of an item. Low infit and outfit (overfit) indicate
over-predictability of an item.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>
Mean-squares are expected to be around 1.0. An aspect of validity is
unidimensionality, which indicates that items in a scale are measuring the same
construct. To assess the unidimensionality of the questionnaire, the items Infit
and Outfit MNSQ statistics were evaluated. An Infit MNSQ or Outfit MNSQ greater
than 1.4, which denotes 40 percent more variance than expected, indicates that
the item may be measuring a different construct; and an Infit MNSQ or Outfit
MNSQ lower that 0.6 indicates item redundancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> Items that do not meet
the Infit and Outfit MNSQ criteria were removed from the model. To evaluate
whether the 4 point-Likert rating scaled used ("very satisfied" to
"not satisfied at all") fits the Rasch model criteria, the following
characteristics were assessed (Linacre): (1) at least 10 observations per
category; (2) regular observation distribution; (3) average measures advance
monotonically with category; (4) outfit MNSQ less than 2; (5) step calibration
advance; (6) ratings imply measures and measure imply ratings; and (7) step
difficulties advance greater than or equal to 1.4 logits and less than 5
logits.</p><p>Construct validity was determined by examining the gaps in the measurement of
each item's calibration value. Z-test analysis was used to determine the
significance of gaps. The presence of significant gaps indicates that some
domains of the job satisfaction construct are not assessed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> Reliability refers to the level of true and error
variance in an observed score. The Rasch person reliability index denotes the
reproducibility of person placement across other items measuring the same
construct, which is equivalent to the Cronbach's alpha (test reliability)
in classical test theory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></p><p>An overall score of job satisfaction among community pharmacists in Tucson was
calculated converting the ordinal responses from the Warr-Cook-Wall
questionnaire to interval data (logits) with the Rasch Model if the Rasch
model's requirements mentioned above were met. A higher score in logits
represents greater job satisfaction (logits typically ranges from -4 to 4). The
Rasch overall score was used as a continuous variable in descriptive, and
non-parametric bivariate analyses to explore differences in job satisfaction and
age, type of degree (PharmD/Non-PharmD), years of experience, workload (Avg.
prescription volume/week, and whether they worked more than 36 hours/week), type
of pharmacy chain (Grocery/non-grocery), having experience outside of community
practice (yes/no), provision of patient care services at the pharmacy (yes/no)
and job position (Pharmacist in charge yes/no) the selection of these variables
was based on previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>
Statistical significance was set at 0.05. The statistical software used were
Winsteps for Rasch analyses and STATA 11.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During the period from August 2011 through November 2011, a total of 32 pharmacists
responded from 129 chain community pharmacies in the cities of Tucson, Marana and
Oro Valley, Arizona. Twenty-two questionnaires were received via fax while 10 were
submitted online. Our estimated response rate was roughly 12%, which was calculated
using an average of 2 pharmacists per store. The true count of pharmacists working
at each store was not available. Pharmacists holding a Doctor of Pharmacy degree
(PharmD) made up 68% (n=21) of respondents and the remaining 32% (n=11) of
respondents held a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BS) degree. Fifty-five percent
of pharmacists surveyed (n=16) were employed at a grocery chain and 45% (n=13) were
based out of a non-grocery chain store and almost two thirds (n=30) of participants
were pharmacists in charge. Most of respondents indicated that they provided patient
care services (94% n=30).

Tucson area retail chain setting. Findings from this study indicate that responding
pharmacists in the Tucson area with practice experience outside community pharmacy
were less satisfied with their job. These findings are consistent with those of
previously published research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>
Several reasons can be thought to explain these results. First, there could be a
perception of over-qualification for the job that may not be present while working
in hospital settings. This is reflected in the responses to the item
"opportunities to use abilities" where only one quarter of respondents
indicated, "very satisfied" to this item. Second, pharmacist in community
settings may be have limited opportunities to growth within the organization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></p><p>The instrument used in this study showed validity and reliability as determined by
the Rasch model when two items were removed from the original questionnaire:
satisfaction with colleagues and amount of variety in the job. Examination of the
items that misfit the model reveled a fit MNSQ greater than two, which indicates
that these items showed excessive unexplained noise. This may be explained by
misunderstanding of the items.</p><p>"Recognition you get for good work" was the item most challenging to agree
with. This is consistent with the Maslow's Theory of Motivation of job
satisfaction where "recognition" is a factor located at a higher level;
and can be achieved only after social, safety and psychological needs are met.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> On the other hand, "Patient
contact" was the easiest item to endorse. This could occur because community
pharmacists in chain settings have more patient contact, which favors interpersonal
interactions. Research has found that pharmacist value these interpersonal
interactions and determine their intention to stay on a job.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></p><p>Due to an unintentional inversion of the response scale during questionnaire
development, we expected to find an inversion of the probability curve in the Rash
model. However, the analysis showed that respondents did not detect the inversion of
the questionnaire scale. That is, respondents selected the option
"satisfied" as it was "somewhat satisfied." This could be
explained by a potential familiarity with 4-point Likert-scale surveys that may
facilitate the identification of the anchors in the scale without carefully reading
options in between. Additionally, research shows that people tend to respond on the
left side of a scale and response order bias is affected by readers'
habits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref></p><p>An area for future research may include broadening the variable "experience
outside community practice" to determine to what pharmacists are comparing to,
when assessing their level of satisfaction. Aspects to consider include the extent
to which the use of clinical skills in other settings affects job satisfaction and
years and related activities of experience working outside community practice.</p><p>As several of the previously reviewed studies have confirmed, the lack of
satisfaction with job can have negative impacts on patient care and safety and can
even be a motivating factor for leaving the job or the profession all together.
Conversely, researchers have found that pharmacists that are more satisfied with
their work are highly motivated to do a good job and make patients and employees
encounters with the pharmacist more positive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>
For this reason, pharmacy job satisfaction surveys are an important part of
identifying the weaknesses of a specific job so that those weaknesses can be
corrected or minimized, while maximizing the strengths, which leads to a better and
safer experience for everyone involved.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study analyzed information from pharmacists working within the cities of
Tucson, Marana and Oro Valley and results may not be generalizable to
pharmacists in other geographic locations. The compiled list of all the
pharmacies in the geographic location did not include independent pharmacies, so
the study cannot be generalized to other pharmacy types. Another limitation is
that some pharmacists might not have been in the pharmacy on the day of
questionnaire dissemination, which means it is possible that not all of the
pharmacists received a questionnaire or to know if a pharmacist actually filled
the questionnaire. Even if a pharmacist received a questionnaire he or she may
not have completed it, or the pharmacy manager may not have distributed the
questionnaires to all of the pharmacists working at the store.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot evaluation suggests that experience outside community practice affects
pharmacist job satisfaction. Additionally, findings from this study indicate that
there is reliability and validity evidence to support the use of the modifies
Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire for assessing overall job satisfaction in chain
community pharmacy practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Competing interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Saari</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Judge</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Employee attitudes and job satisfaction</article-title><source>Hum Resour Manage</source><year>2004</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>395</fpage><lpage>407</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Murawski</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Payakachat</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Koh-Knox</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Factors affecting job and career satisfaction among community
