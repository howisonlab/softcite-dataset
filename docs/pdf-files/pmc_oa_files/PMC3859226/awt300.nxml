We identified a novel familial Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 calcium channel mutation, R1242G, localized to the third positive charge of the domain IV voltage sensor. Functional expression of R1242G in the muscular dysgenesis mouse cell line GLT revealed a 28% reduced central pore inward current and a &#x02212;20 mV shift of the steady-state inactivation curve. Both changes may be at least partially explained by an outward omega (gating pore) current at positive potentials. Moreover, this outward omega current of 27.5 nS/nF may cause the reduction of the overshoot by 13 mV and slowing of the upstroke of action potentials by 36% that are associated with muscle hypoexcitability (permanent weakness and myopathic myopathy). In addition to the outward omega current, we identified an inward omega pore current of 95 nS/nF at negative membrane potentials after long depolarizing pulses that shifts the R1242G residue above the omega pore constriction. A simulation reveals that the inward current might depolarize the fibre sufficiently to trigger calcium release in the absence of an action potential and therefore cause an electrically silent depolarization-induced muscle contracture. Additionally, evidence of the inward current can be found in <sup>23</sup>Na magnetic resonance imaging-detected sodium accumulation and <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance imaging-detected oedema. We hypothesize that the episodes are normokalaemic because of depolarization-induced compensatory outward potassium flux through both delayed rectifiers and omega pore. We conclude that the position of the R1242G residue before elicitation of the omega current is decisive for its conductance: if the residue is located below the gating pore as in the resting state then outward currents are observed; if the residue is above the gating pore because of depolarization, as in the inactivated state, then inward currents are observed. This study shows for the first time that functional characterization of omega pore currents is possible using a cultured cell line expressing mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels. Likewise, it is the first calcium channel mutation for complicated normokalaemic periodic paralysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="keywords"><kwd>periodic paralyses</kwd><kwd>omega pore</kwd><kwd>voltage sensor</kwd><kwd>calcium channel</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Periodic paralyses are recurrent bouts of flaccid limb weakness traditionally differentiated by accompanying changes in serum potassium levels, as hyperkalaemic, hypokalaemic or normokalaemic episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B5">Fontaine, 2008</xref>). Each of these variants of periodic paralysis is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in skeletal muscle cation channels; however, the specific mutations elicit differing functional defects. Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis is caused by destabilized inactivation of the main ion conducting pore, whereas normokalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are caused by an accessory current through the so-called omega pore, resulting from a short circuit of intracellular and extracellular compartments produced directly by voltage sensor mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B2">Cannon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B3">Catterall 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B9">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Mutations for all three types of periodic paralysis are found in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 sodium channel encoded by <italic>SCN4A</italic>. To date, mutations in the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 calcium channel encoded by <italic>CACNA1S</italic> have been associated only with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Nearly all of these mutations are located in the transmembrane S4 segments, and neutralize positive charges important for voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B16">Matthews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Similar to the hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations in Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, the two most frequent Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutations (R528H and R1239H) produce inward omega currents that result in membrane depolarization, reduced membrane excitability, and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B31">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, the position of the S4 mutation determines the voltage range in which the omega current occurs. For example, mutations of the first arginine in domain II, II-R1, as well as II-R2 and III-R2 mutations generate omega currents that are activated by hyperpolarization, are active at the usual resting potential, and are only closed by depolarization large enough to activate S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B20">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B25">Struyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B22">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B32">Francis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B30">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Depending on the substituting residue, the omega current may be carried by protons or cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B24">Struyk and Cannon, 2007</xref>). Omega pores conduct currents that show an above-linear increase in amplitude with hyperpolarization that reflects the stochastic process of a voltage-dependent open probability and follows a Boltzmann distribution. In contrast to the hyperpolarization-induced omega currents from substitutions of the outer two arginine residues R1 or R2, II-R3 mutations in Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 generate cation-selective currents that are activated by depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B21">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Such an omega current is deactivated by hyperpolarization and the associated disease phenotype is normokalaemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B28">Vicart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we report an American family with normokalaemic periodic paralysis and recurrent cramping, oedema and neuronal compression with additional progressive myopathy caused by a novel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1-R1242G mutation. Similar to normokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations in the sodium channel domain II, R1242G affects the third arginine of S4. Our results suggest that the pathogenesis associated with R1242G differs from the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations. This is the first report of an omega pore induced by functional expression of a calcium channel mutation in cultured cells, while previously studied muscle fibres may have been altered by secondary changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B31">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The family members gave their written informed consent to the genetic and 3T <sup>23</sup>Na-MRI studies, which were approved of by the Ethics Committee of both Ulm and Heidelberg University and were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki in its present form.

Triggers for the weakness episodes were cold and rest after exercise. Progressive weakness started in adulthood and led to wheelchair dependence at the age of 57. Ictal potassium levels were normal and KCl three times daily did not improve muscle strength. Death occurred at the age of 71 from respiratory failure after anaesthesia.</p><p>Female Patient II:2 (63-years-old) had painful muscle cramping in the lower legs elicited by walking and by febrile infections between early teens and adulthood. The cramping muscles were solid for days, could not be relieved by passive stretching, and were paralysed for months or permanently, requiring leg braces for dropped feet. Weakness spells without preceding cramps only occurred twice, once by stress and once following a meal, and both resolved after 1 h. A permanent weakness causing inability to participate in physical education during elementary school increased in late adolescence and adulthood. The overall muscle strength declined, as an inability to climb stairs without railing, to arise from a chair, to get up from a prone position or to arise from bed became the characteristic features. She became wheelchair bound at the age of 50. Progressive weakness led to the latest status at age 62 according to MRC rating scale: diffuse atrophy of extremities, bilateral scapular winging, forearm flexion 2/2 (right/left), wrist extension 5/4, finger flexion 4/4, hip flexion 1/1, knee extension 1/1, knee flexion 1/1, foot dorsiflexion 4/1, and foot plantar flexion 4/4. Tendon reflexes were absent. Ictal and interictal potassium levels always were normal at 4.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 mM (<italic>n = </italic>78), with 500 mg/d acetazolamide administered for decades with equivocal benefit. Diclofenamide was more effective and improved permanent muscle weakness at 25 mg/d but was discontinued because of cognitive impairment including mental fatigue, uneasiness, irritability, depression, drowsiness and confusion. A combination of acetazolamide 125 mg/d, eplerenone 50 mg/d and KCl 40 mmol/d increased serum potassium to 4.8 to 5.2 mM and subjectively improved muscle endurance.</p><p>Female Patient II:4 (54-years-old) was born floppy and showed delayed motor development. Cramps leading to solid muscles were triggered by walks and cold environment and were not relieved by passive stretching. During cramping, all muscles innervated by the profound peroneus nerve were weak and exhibited electrical silence in the EMG. Additionally, the corresponding skin of the anteriolateral lower leg and the dorsal foot was hypaesthesic and hypalgesic. After one of these episodes of cramping, serum values for creatine kinase (15 500 U/l), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (1185 U/l) and potassium (5.4 mM) were markedly increased. Weeks later, EMG recordings of tibialis and peroneus longus muscles revealed fibrillations and positive waves as well as small compound muscle action potentials and long distal latencies. Because of the dropped foot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/brain/awt300/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</ext-link>), a leg brace was required. The only weakness episode without preceding cramps was triggered by local anaesthesia containing epinephrine. The latest status at the age of 53 revealed a positive Trendelenburg sign bilaterally, ubiquitous muscle atrophy especially in the feet, and inability to squat or walk on toes or heels. Foot dorsiflexion was +4 on the right, and +1 on the left side. Tendon reflexes were reduced but not absent. Proximal muscles showed mild myopathic changes in the EMG. Interictal potassium levels were always normal (4.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 mM, <italic>n = </italic>22), also with 500 mg/d acetazolamide administered for decades with equivocal benefit. Similarly, diclofenamide improved permanent muscle weakness at 25 mg/d but was discontinued because of semantic deficit i.e. misusing the names of everyday items, which strikingly reduced her professional practice. A combination of acetazolamide 125 mg/d, eplerenone 50 mg/d and KCl 40 mmol/d increased serum potassium to 4.8 to 5.2 mM and stabilized muscle function.

Steady-state currents elicited by 200 ms step pulses showed that in all myotubes, there was an inward current induced at hyperpolarized potentials with guanidinium in the external solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A&#x02013;C). Based on the current-voltage relationship and the fact that the inward current was present in both mutant and wild-type myotubes, we hypothesize that this inward current reflects guanidinium passing through the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 channels and is not the result of mutation. In contrast, the mutant R1242G showed depolarization-induced outward omega currents carried by caesium that were small or absent in wild-type or in untransfected myotubes which we interpret to be an effect of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Ion substitution experiments showed that the large organic ion NMDG<sup>+</sup> was not conducted by the omega pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F3">Fig. 3</xref>C).

The current-voltage curve was constructed by currents versus their corresponding voltages calculated using the known time course of the ramp protocol. The plotted points are not steady-state current values but averages of the corresponding values of the measurements during the ramp. SEM bars were determined at every 5 mV instead of each voltage for clarity. R1242G showed obvious inward current carried by guanidinium responding to ramp depolarization. For consistency, subtraction of linear passive current was done by the values measured at &#x02212;90 mV for all figure parts.

In the only work measuring omega currents in human muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), which are always heterozygous because of the autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease, R528H native muscle fibres had a conductance of 12 &#x000b5;S/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is indeed about half of the conductance of the homozygous R528H mouse muscle fibres of 28 &#x000b5;S/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore our data in mouse myotube preparations are comparable to all previous data available on Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 omega currents.</p><p>In addition, R1242G showed a hyperpolarization-induced inward omega pore current carried by guanidinium, observed over the entire range of physiological voltages, after 1 min pre-depolarization to +30 mV to inactive calcium channels followed by a ramp from &#x02212;140 mV to +30 mV over 7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F3">Fig. 3</xref>D). This current is not because of a shift in the electrode junction potential because pipette offset before and after the recordings remained unchanged. Also, subtraction of the wild-type from R1242G yields a current that is neither constant nor linear (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/brain/awt300/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</ext-link>). One explanation could be that the IVS4 segment recovers during the ramp. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the reverse ramp (7 s ramp from +30 mV to &#x02212;140 mV after 1 min +30 mV depolarization pulse). The resulting inward omega current (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/brain/awt300/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</ext-link>) exhibited reduced current values for potentials more negative than &#x02212;100 mV in agreement with the idea of a recovery of IVS4 after &#x0223c;5.5 s. It has a maximal conductance of about (&#x02212;3.2 + 2.25 pA/pF) / (&#x02212;140 + 130 mV) = 95 nS/nF in the range of &#x02212;140 mV to &#x02212;130 mV. We conclude that the inward omega current is conducted by a IVS4 segment that has moved above the omega pore constriction. As the omega current is visible over the whole voltage range, linear fitting of the values obtained during the ramp was not performed since it would subtract part of the non-linear omega current.</p><p>Taken together, the decisive element for the omega current seems to be the position of the R1242G residue with respect to the gating pore constriction before testing for the omega currents. If the residue is located below the gating pore as in the resting state then outward currents are observed; if the residue is above the gating pore due to depolarization as in the inactivated state then inward currents are observed. As the inward omega currents are &#x0223c;3-fold larger than the outward omega currents, there seems to be some degree of rectification.</p></sec><sec><title>Action potentials</title><p>We tested the direct effect of the omega current on action potentials using whole-cell current clamp recordings in GLT myotubes.

Although the omega current for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations R528H or R2139H follow a single Boltzmann relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B31">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), the omega current of R1242G is almost constant in the range of &#x02212;120 mV to &#x02212;20 mV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/brain/awt300/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</ext-link>).
<fig id="awt300-F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Simulation of periodic paralysis. On basis of simulated inwardly rectifying potassium current IK, comparison of the steady-state current voltage relationships in controls, hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and our family (normokalaemic periodic paralysis), the latter both obtained by addition of omega currents to the control curve. Note that at normal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="awt300i5.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 4 mM, a depolarizing trigger can depolarize the membrane to &#x02212;40 mV at which there would be electrically silent cramps. In the <italic>inset</italic>, a similar depolarization contracture is shown in paramyotonia congenita in which cooling causes a severe depolarization to about &#x02212;35 mV: after the fifth electrically induced muscle twitch, the excised bundle, that consisted of only few muscle fibre layers, contracted without electrical activity (<italic>lower</italic> trace; modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B18">Ricker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). The electrical silence during the contracture is verified by wire electrodes that crossed the fibres on both surfaces of the bundle and recorded random action potential spikes; during the time of stimulation the EMG amplifier was overloaded (<italic>upper</italic> trace). PP = periodic paralysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="awt300f5p"/></fig></p><p>At normal extracellular <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="awt300i6.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 4 mM, there is only stable membrane potential (where current is zero). Typically paralysis is achieved by hypokalaemia, which reduces the inwardly rectifying potassium conductance by collapsing the pore thereby reducing the steepness of the curves so much that a second stable resting potential at &#x02212;60 mV appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In contrast, at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="awt300i7.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 4 mM a depolarizing trigger (i.e. exertional exercise) can depolarize R1242G muscle to &#x02212;40 mV at which there would be electrically silent contractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The contracture results because &#x02212;40 mV is the mechanical threshold at which Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 can interact with the ryanodine receptor to initiate intracellular calcium release (this threshold is below the threshold of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 central pore current of about &#x02212;20 mV). The electrical silence observed in the cramping patients is because at &#x02212;40 mV sodium channels are inactivated as well. Depolarization to this value has been shown to produce electrically silent cramps followed by weakness previously, such as in paramyotonia congenita (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awt300-F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the periodic paralyses, the level of serum potassium during a paralytic attack determines the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="awt300-T3">Table 3</xref>). While hyperkalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are accepted as separate entities, ictal normokalaemia has been a matter of debate. The term normokalaemic periodic paralysis was coined in the 1960s. The disorder resembled hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis and its existence as a nosological entity was questioned when the identification of the most frequent hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis mutation, Na<sub>v</sub>1.4-M1592V, in one of the two original families was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B4">Chinnery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Later a potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis with normokalaemia caused by Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 mutations at the third arginine of the voltage sensor of domain II at codon 675 also was diagnosed as normokalaemic periodic paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B28">Vicart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and again interpreted as hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis because of the triggering effect of potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B23">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

In agreement with this, our family shows a number of symptoms that may be found in all types of periodic paralysis such as post-natal hypotonia, periodic paralysis triggered by stress and cold, and response to carboanhydrase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="awt300-T3">Table 3</xref>). Further, myoplasmic sodium and water accumulation as an indicator for the permanent weakness was present in our family as in both hypokalaemic and hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B1">Amarteifio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, our family additionally displays features not found in other forms of periodic paralysis such as: (i) triggering by exercise rather than by rest after exercise; (ii) absence of the periodic paralysis typical late decline in the long exercise test; and (iii) pre-ictal painful muscle swelling and cramping rather than post-ictal muscle soreness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="awt300-T3">Table 3</xref>). The episodes resulted in rhabdomyolysis and compression of nerves, leading up to the development of drop feet and muscle degeneration in the tibialis anterior group. This is in contrast to the previously reported 25 patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in whom mainly the triceps surae muscles, but not the tibilias anterior groups, were affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). As in the acute phase the patients showed an albeit reduced pulse of the arteria dorsalis pedis and as no operative pressure release was required, our patients did not experience complete compartment syndrome. Therefore, we used the term &#x02018;transient compartment-like syndrome&#x02019; to describe the phenomenon (in analogy to transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic brain insult).</p><p>Molecular genetics identified R1242G of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 voltage sensor in domain IV; such mutations in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 have so far only been related to hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Although previously identified mutations neutralize the superficial first or second voltage sensor arginines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B9">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), the novel R1242G amino acid substitution neutralizes the deeper third voltage sensor arginine. This location is in agreement with Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 mutations of a third arginine in domain II (R675Q/G/W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B21">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) that cause normokalaemic periodic paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B28">Vicart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), whereas more superficially located replacements of voltage sensor arginines cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B2">Cannon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B9">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>As typical for all types of periodic paralysis, the patients responded with benefit to the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors acetazolamide and diclofenamide, as well as to the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone. Both drug groups can repolarize and re-establish the excitability of depolarized muscle fibres and thereby wash out intracellular sodium ion and reduce oedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B27">Tricarico and Camerino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B15">Lehmann-Horn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The triple therapy consisting of low to moderate doses of acetazolamide, eplerenone and potassium seems to be a favourable medication with low risk of adverse effects, at least in this family harbouring the novel normokalaemic periodic paralysis mutation Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1-R1242G. The previous statement that acetazolamide worsens periodic paralysis if caused by an R-to-G mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B17">Matthews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), was not confirmed.</p><p>Our data revealed that R1242G currents produced biophysical defects different from those previously reported for periodic paralysis mutations. First, R1242G revealed a reduced central pore inward current and a left-shift of its steady-state inactivation curve. However, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1-R1242G also revealed a depolarization-induced outward omega current that could at last partially explain these two features. Similarly, the depolarization-activated outward omega current would oppose the inward sodium current during the rising phase of the action potential and contribute to the reduced size and altered shape of action potentials. This would explain the hypoexcitability of the patients&#x02019; musculature which furthers the permanent weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B6">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Next to the delayed rectifiers, the outward omega current carried by potassium might help maintain the ictal normokalaemia determining the diagnosis.</p><p>In addition to the outward omega current, we identified an inward omega current over a range of negative membrane potentials, after a long depolarization of 1 min duration. According to our simulation for patient muscle, the sodium conductance of the omega pores may be high enough to depolarize the membrane beyond the mechanical threshold of &#x02212;40 mV and thereby induce muscle contracture. This is experienced by the patients as cramps that cannot be relieved by passive stretching and that are characterized by electrical silence in the EMG. We hypothesize that depolarized muscle fibres take up not only sodium through the omega pore but also osmotic water, to cause fibre swelling that may compress nerves, experienced by the patients as pain and drop foot (transient compartment-like syndrome). The sustained membrane depolarization would inactivate Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels and impair the generation of action potentials, an effect experienced by the patients as weakness as in the classical model of periodic paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="awt300-B13">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Additionally the whole-cell measurements revealed that R1242G recovered faster than wild-type channels from the inactivated state, revealing gain of function and furthering the tendency towards muscle fibre depolarization.</p></sec>
