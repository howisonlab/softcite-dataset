As glycogen synthase (GS) is a key enzyme involved in the synthetic process, it presents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we identified a novel, potent and orally available GS activator AJS1669 {sodium 2-[[5-[[4-(4,5-difluoro-2-methylsulfanyl-phenyl) phenoxy] methyl]furan-2-carbonyl]-(2-furylmethyl)amino] acetate}. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we performed a glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) activation assay for screening GS activators and identified that the activity of AJS1669 was further potentiated in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). <italic>In vivo</italic>, we used <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice to evaluate the novel anti-diabetic effects of AJS1669 by measuring basal blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance and body fat mass index. Repeated administration of AJS1669 over 4 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. AJS1669 also improved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased body fat mass. The mRNA levels of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis were elevated in skeletal muscle tissue following AJS1669 treatment. Hepatic tissue of treated mice also exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. In contrast to <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, in C57Bl/6 mice AJS1669 administration did not alter body weight or reduce glucose levels. These results demonstrate that pharmacological agents that activate GYS1, the main GS subtype found in skeletal muscle, have potential for use as novel treatments for diabetes that improve glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glycogen synthase</kwd><kwd>AJS1669</kwd><kwd>glucose tolerance</kwd><kwd>fat mass</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2010, 285 million adults (aged 20 to 79 years) were estimated to have diabetes globally, and this number is expected to reach 439 million by 2030 (<xref rid="b1-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, although several types of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes have been marketed, pioglitazone and metformin are most commonly used as insulin sensitizers (<xref rid="b2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>In humans, skeletal muscle is the major site of glucose uptake and glycogen storage, with both processes being regulated by insulin. Impaired glycogen synthesis is the major abnormality in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="b3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>13</sup>C-NMR) spectroscopy in subjects undergoing hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamping revealed that patients with diabetes have a 50% or greater decrease in glycogen synthesis relative to healthy individuals (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In analyses performed at the cellular level, patients with type 2 diabetes involving insulin resistance were found to have decreased glycogen synthase (GS) activity in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Insulin sensitivity was found to be enhanced by exercise or weight loss associated with exercise (<xref rid="b8-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Exercise activates GS and enhances insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="b11-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Activation of GS in type 2 diabetes and correction of glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle have therefore been regarded as effective approaches to treating diabetes (<xref rid="b14-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In skeletal muscle, GS is one of the key enzymes in glucose metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is converted to UDP-glucose, and GS forms &#x003b1;-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas branching enzymes create &#x003b1;-1,6-glycosidic linkages (<xref rid="b15-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). There are two GS isoforms in mammals, with 69% homology. One is encoded by the glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) gene and is expressed only in the liver, whereas the other is encoded by GYS1 and is expressed in the skeletal muscle, brain, kidneys, pancreas and adipose tissue (<xref rid="b16-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Recently, GS activators have been developed by Roche (<xref rid="b18-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). One of the reported compounds was shown to activate GS in the skeletal muscle and liver in a concentration-dependent manner. Repeated administration of this compound in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice at a dose of 75 mg/kg significantly reduced the blood glucose level but did not result in weight gain. We identified AJS1669, as a novel allosteric activator of GYS1. AJS1669 activates human GYS1 (hGYS1) in a concentration-dependent manner. Its activation was found to be additive with G6P, an allosteric activator. AJS1669 accelerated not only glycogen accumulation, but also glycogen degradation <italic>in vitro</italic>, since the accumulation rate was higher with co-administration of a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor. In the present study, we selected <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice for evaluating the effects of this compound on blood glucose level, oral glucose tolerance and &#x003b2;-oxidation, since AJS1669 has the potential for normalizing blood glucose levels through glycogen metabolism, similar to exercise, and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice do not have exercise capacity. We were thus able to exclude the potential effects of exercise and increased skeletal muscle mass in our experimental design. Repeated administration of 10 mg/kg of AJS1669 over 4 weeks effectively reduced blood glucose level and improved glucose tolerance without excessive body weight gain. Excessive glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle was not observed, as reflected by <italic>in vitro</italic> testing. Moreover, fat mass was decreased, and we observed upregulation of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that AJS1669 has potential as a new insulin sensitizer, as it reduces fat mass with upregulation of &#x003b2;-oxidation through acceleration of glycogen turnover.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p>Sodium 2-[[5-[[4-(4,5-difluoro-2-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)phenoxy]methyl]furan-2-carbonyl]-(2-furyl-methyl)amino] acetate (AJS1669) (<xref rid="f1-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) was synthesized by Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

The pcDNA 3.1(+) expression vector (Life Technologies Japan, Kanagawa, Japan) containing hGYS1 was transiently transfected into 293T cells. All transfected cells were cultured for 2 days, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dissolved in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, and 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The mixture was homogenized and centrifuged at 16,000 &#x000d7; g at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min. The precipitated fraction was then reconstituted in lysis buffer and used as a source of the GS enzyme for evaluation after enzyme expression levels were verified by immunoblotting.</p><p>The GS (hGYS1) assay was performed as described previously (<xref rid="b20-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In short, a solution containing AJS1669 at various concentrations with or without 10 mM G6P was added to a polystyrene 96-well half-area plate (12 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l/well). Next, 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of a substrate solution containing 21.6 mM UDP-glucose, 21.6 mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid and 4.05 mM NADH was added to each well.

The assay evaluating glucose incorporation into glycogen was performed using previously published methods (<xref rid="b21-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) with slight modification. Briefly, after cells were plated onto a collagen-coated 96-well plate with SkGM-2 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for one day, the cells were subsequently differentiated using serum-reduced SkGM-2 containing 2% FBS for 3 days. The cells were then starved for 4 h with glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies Japan) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). They were then incubated for 3 h with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, 1 g/l glucose, and 0.19 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>/l [<sup>14</sup>C] glucose (Perkin-Elmer Japan, Tokyo, Japan). After washing with ice-cold PBS, cell homogenates were dissolved using 1 N NaOH for 10 min at 60&#x000b0;C and transferred to 96-well MultiScreen HTS plates (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Multiscreen plates were washed twice with ice-cold 66% (v/v) ethanol and allowed to dry completely. Incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C] UDP-glucose into glycogen was measured using a scintillation counter. The decay rate (counts/min, cpm) measured in the wells containing AJS1669 at the final concentration of 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M was taken as 100% in the calculations of relative activity (%) after subtracting the cpm of the background wells, which contained dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) only.</p></sec><sec><title>Assay of GS activity in mouse tissue lysates</title><p>Lysates of muscle and liver tissues obtained from mice fasted for 16 h were homogenized by Microson XL2000 (Qsonica, Newtown, CT, USA) in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM KF (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.0), and 10% glycerol. After centrifugation (16,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 min), the supernatant was collected and used as the enzyme solution. The enzyme was incubated 3 times with each studied concentration of test compounds for 30 min before the GS assay was performed. GS assay was performed using previously described methods (<xref rid="b22-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

Group allocation was specifically designed so that no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, body weight, and blood glucose level was observed across groups. Mice were orally administered vehicle alone (0.5% methylcellulose), with AJS1669 (3 or 10 mg/kg), or with pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) twice daily (at 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.) for 4 weeks. Body weight and food intake were monitored every 2 or 3 days. Blood samples were taken from unrestrained mice by cutting off the tip of the tail. Blood glucose levels were measured every 2 weeks using a Lifecheck sensor (Gunze, Osaka, Japan), and blood HbA1c levels was measured on day 28 (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Body composition was analyzed on day 26 using EchoMRI (EchoMRI LLC, Houston, TX, USA). EchoMRI provides a precise and accurate method for determining the fat and lean tissue content of mice without requiring anesthesia (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Change in fat mass and lean mass were analyzed by comparing the fat mass before administration and after 4 weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was performed following an overnight fast. After OGTT was performed, the mice were fed for another 3 days and then sacrificed.

AJS1669 showed increased stimulation of glycogen production in the presence of glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor (GPI) than in the absence of GPI, whereas GPI alone did not increase the [<sup>14</sup>C] glycogen level (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the ability of AJS1669 to increase glycogen level is not a consequence of glycogenolysis inhibition, but rather reflects an activation of glycogen synthesis, with AJS1669 upregulating the turnover of glycogen metabolism in the muscle cells by activating both glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of chronic 4-week administration of AJS1669 in normal mice and diabetic ob/ob mice</title><p>To confirm the ability of AJS1669 to act as a GYS1 activator with long-term administration, <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice were administered 3 or 10 mg/kg of AJS1669 orally twice daily.

The group receiving 10 mg/kg AJS1669 exhibited a significant decrease in blood glucose level at day 28 (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, a reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed at day 28 (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

AJS1669 also exhibited the ability to activate skeletal muscle GS to the same extent as 3 mM G6P in assessment using lysates of mouse skeletal muscle. However, the ability of AJS1669 to activate liver GS was not stronger than its effect on skeletal muscle. AJS1669 acted potently in skeletal muscle and exhibited greater activation with a lower dose in the presence of a high G6P concentration.</p><p>To assess the effects at the phenotypic level, skeletal muscle cells were incubated with AJS1669. AJS1669 increased the glycogen level in a concentration-dependent manner. Intriguingly, incubation with AJS1669 and GPI increased glycogen levels to a greater extent than did AJS1669 administered alone. In contrast, no increase was observed following incubation with a GPI alone.</p><p>These observations suggest that in addition to promoting glycogen synthesis, AJS1669 caused some glycogen degradation, apparently enhancing the glycogen metabolism turnover. AJS1669 was developed as a hypoglycemic agent for transforming blood glucose into glycogen in both skeletal muscle and liver. However, if AJS1669 can ameliorate insulin resistance as a PPAR agonist, then it could be the first in a new class of insulin sensitizers.</p><p>Reportedly, PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4; agonists do not directly activate glycogen synthesis, but rather act to enhance glycogen formation by stimulation of insulin receptors (<xref rid="b24-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We therefore assessed the effect of AJS1669 on the activity of each PPAR subtype. AJS1669 did not elicit any increase in PPAR&#x003b1;, &#x003b3; or &#x003b4; activity at a concentration of 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M (data not shown), which is higher than the physiological level resulting from administration of 10 mg/kg AJS1669 (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the pharmacological effect of AJS1669, we measured the concentration of AJS1669 in both the muscle and liver of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. The concentration in the muscle was 0.31 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, which was higher than the EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.037 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M with G6P (<xref rid="f1-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Based on the potential of AJS1669 for improving glycogen metabolism determined through <italic>in vitro</italic> tests, we selected <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, which are hyperinsulinemic, bulimic, and do not actively exercise. Diabetic-induced mice (DIO) were not used because they are easily affected by food consumption and exercise capacity. Additionally, db/db mice were not used because they may experience body weight loss as a result of hyperglycemia.</p><p>Since the AJS1669 concentration of 3 mg/kg observed in the muscle <italic>in vivo</italic> was sufficient to activate GYS1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and following the 3Rs policy, we decided to use 10 mg/kg as the maximum dose for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The concentration of AJS1669 was much higher in the liver than that noted in muscle. As previously reported, the furanyl group of AJS1669 has high stability with respect to liver metabolism as it is a 5-membered ring (<xref rid="b26-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The ability of AJS1669 to reduce blood glucose levels, decrease HbA1c levels, and improve glucose tolerance was observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration (<xref rid="f4-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, repeated administration of AJS1669 did not elicit a major change in food consumption. Additionally, 4 weeks of repeated administration of AJS1669 did not elevate the blood lactic acid level (data not shown). No abnormalities were observed in the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, which reflect the liver safety profile (<xref rid="tII-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). Similarly, C57BL/6 mice treated for 4 weeks with 30 mg/kg AJS1669 exhibited no changes in body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels, ALT levels, or AST levels (data not shown). AJS1669 therefore does not appear to reduce fat mass by any toxic mechanism.</p><p>Intriguingly, although muscle glycogen levels in all animals in the group treated with 10 mg/kg AJS1669 was increased in comparison with the vehicle-treated group levels, the change was not significant. The same results were observed for pioglitazone-treated animals. Because both AJS1669 and pioglitazone improved glucose tolerance (<xref rid="f4-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), glycogen levels could be increased by administration of these compounds. In this study, utilizing <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, a significant increase in muscle glycogen may not have been detected (<xref rid="f5-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, AJS1669 increased the glycogen level in muscle cells, and this level was additively increased under treatment with both AJS1669 and GPI (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, AJS1669 increased not only glycogen accumulation but also glycogen degradation, and this machinery could improve glycogen metabolism. In exercise, both glycogen accumulation and glycogen degradation are involved in energy homeostasis and regulation of insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="b27-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Since AJS1669 improves the energy capacity of skeletal muscles, it was necessary for us to choose diabetic animals for evaluating this compound. Evaluation of these mice showed that pioglitazone treatment significantly increased the whole body fat mass (a harmful side effect), whereas AJS1669 was observed to markedly decrease the fat mass as we hypothesized (<xref rid="f5-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). AJS1669 thus appears to directly induce both glycogen synthesis and glycogen turnover, and therefore may be the first in a new class of insulin sensitizers.</p><p>To examine the possibility that the effect of AJS1669 on muscle glycogen causes a metabolic response in muscle, &#x003b2;-oxidation-related genes were also evaluated (<xref rid="b28-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Increases in the expression of &#x003b2;-oxidation-related genes involved in lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle and liver, as well as in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, were observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration of AJS1669. Although AJS1669 treatment did not alter the expression of <italic>Gys1</italic> in skeletal muscle tissue, it significantly increased the expression of <italic>Tfam</italic>, a gene involved in the stability and transport of mitochondrial gene transcripts. Additionally, a trend towards an increase in the expression of genes involved in &#x003b2;-oxidation, such as <italic>Cpt1b</italic> and <italic>Acadm</italic>, was observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration. Regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation by AJS1669 is likely to be associated with a decrease in fat mass. In the liver, no significant modulation of genes controlling gluconeogenesis was observed. As evidenced by the lack of effect on the liver observed through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, AJS1669 may not alter glucose metabolism by directly affecting the liver as excessive liver glycogen accumulation would inhibit the fat mass decrease (<xref rid="b29-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) or reduce body fat mass by attenuating food intake in high-fat-diet model mice (<xref rid="b30-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the present study, AJS1669 did not induce accumulation of liver glycogen or decrease fat mass. Following the upregulation of &#x003b2;-oxidation-related genes involved in lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle, lipid flow may be altered across the entire body, thus affecting oxidation in the liver.</p><p>Although AJS1669 improved glucose homeostasis while decreasing the fat mass in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, this effect was not stronger than the action of pioglitazone. No significant glucose-lowering action was observed at day 17 following administration, and a longer administration period may be required to accurately demonstrate drug efficacy relative to pioglitazone. The physiological mechanism underlying this difference is currently not known, but a number of factors may be involved. AJS1669 could potentially activate GYS1 at a concentration of &#x0003c;1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="f1-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B and C</xref> and <xref rid="f2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). However, the plasma concentration of AJS1669 at 2 h after administration was below 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The dose of AJS1669 used in our experiments (10 mg/kg) may thus not be the optimal dose to elicit the desired pharmacological actions. Moreover, 4 weeks of repeated administration may result in attainment of a homeostatic phase and thus may not be an appropriate term for evaluating the maximum pharmacological effect of this compound. Our aim was to determine the length of time over which administration of AJS1669 can maintain the initial change in glucose metabolism, and we found the duration to surpass 4 weeks. Since fat mass was reduced in AJS1669-treated animals, glucose tolerance was improved, and because the mRNA levels of a number of genes were significantly altered in both skeletal muscle and liver, long-term administration may elicit stronger pharmacological effects. Another factor affecting body composition may be the difference in glycogen metabolism between muscle and liver tissue. In mice, the basal amount of glycogen in the skeletal muscle at satiation is approximately one-tenth of that in the liver, and glycogen metabolism is thought to affect glucose metabolism more significantly in the liver than in the skeletal muscle (<xref rid="b31-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In humans, however, skeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of body composition (<xref rid="b32-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and plays a central role in glucose metabolism (<xref rid="b33-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the present study in mouse tissue lysates, AJS1669 elicited a stronger effect in the skeletal muscle than in the liver (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), with intense effects not achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We therefore postulate that the pharmacological effect of AJS1669 observed in mice should be far more pronounced in humans.</p><p>In skeletal muscle tissue of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes or obese patients, a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity has been reported (<xref rid="b34-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), along with lower expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref rid="b36-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Increased physical activity and weight loss interventions in these patients were the main inducers of improved mitochondrial functional capacity, and these changes in the mitochondria were associated with improvement of insulin resistance (<xref rid="b38-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-ijmm-39-04-0841" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Considering the association between GS activity and mitochondrial function, a number of unanswered questions remain regarding the molecules that are directly involved. It is, however, conceivable that repeated administration of AJS1669 may alter glycogen metabolism, and may therefore mimic the effects of exercise and weight loss.</p><p>In conclusion, previous studies suggest that beneficial alterations of glycogen metabolism, similar to the physiological effects of physical exercise, may result from attenuation of GS activity in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, AJS1669 enhanced glycogen metabolism and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and consequently elicited a reduction in body fat mass and exhibited anti-diabetic activity. AJS1669 therefore exhibits potential for use as a new insulin resistance-improving drug with a mechanism of action distinct from that of pioglitazone. AJS1669 can be regarded as a promising candidate compound for the management of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to give special thanks to Atsushi Konishi and Yukio Iino (Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) for supervising us in this study.
