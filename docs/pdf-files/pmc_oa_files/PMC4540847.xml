effect of exercise on glycemic control, the lipid profile, body composition, vascular
health, and complications in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. [Subjects and Methods]
The subjects were 1,263 patients receiving outpatient care at 13 general hospitals located
in Seoul and Gyeonggido who were subjected to examinations in the areas of blood glucose
management, complications management, and diabetes education between March 19 and May 29,
2013. The relations between exercise and various regulatory factors including patient&#x02019;s
general and clinical characteristics, metabolic regulation, achievement of goals for
metabolic regulation, and complication incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes were
investigated. [Results] Exercise management was associated with a decrease in systolic
blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol,
triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein Regarding achievement of goals for metabolic
regulation, significant odds ratios were observed for the effect of exercise treatment on
blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, HDL
in men, and BMI in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, exercise management was
associated with decreased occurrence of cerebrovasculopathy. [Conclusion] In conclusion,
exercise induced metabolic regulation of glycemic control, the lipid profile, and body
composition, as well as vascular health and complications, in Korean patients with type 2
diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a widely known chronic metabolic disease in nearly all
countries that is characterized by an increase in the blood-glucose level resulting from
impairment of &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is associated with
changes in body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, the quality of life, and the others as
well as complications related to the cardiovascular, renal, optic, and neural system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has become a leading global factor of mortality and
morbidity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The population with type 2
diabetes would increase worldwide by 11.4% from 366 million in 2011 to 522 million by 2030,
representing about one in 10 adult. In Korea, the prevalence rate of diabetes is expected to
be similar to the global trend, and the global rate has increased approximately seven-fold,
from 1.5 to 9.9%, during the past 40 years<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, diabetes has become one of the leading causes of
death, and the rate of death is the twice as high as that among persons without the
disorder<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although there has been noticeable development of new treatment
modalities for diabetes, many studies have reported that the prevalence of diabetes is
expected to double over the next 25 years<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinical trials for patients with diabetes are focused on intensive glycemic control to
prevent hypoglycemia by multifactorial interventions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adjustment of food intake,
pharmacological therapy, and exercise are suggested as the three major sources of therapy
for type 2 diabetes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially,
exercise is an important part of the diabetes management plan. Exercise improves longevity
and ameliorates the health of patients with type 2 diabetes. It has an well-known impact on
glycated hemoglobin as well as independent effects on other parameters of cardio-metabolic
risk by promoting endothelial function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although most guidelines has emphasized the importance of exercise training and numerous
studies have demonstrated effects on diabetes in experimental environments, large-scale
research of relations between these interventions and diabetes have been lacking until
recent years in Korea<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
aim of present study was to investigate the current evidence for the effect of exercise on
glycemic control, the lipid profile, body composition, vascular health, and complications in
a number of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed for two months, from March 19, 2013, to May 29, 2013, at 13
general hospitals located in Seoul and Gyeonggi province, Republic of Korea. Patients over
20&#x02005;year old and registered as having type 2 diabetes, excluding those with type 1 diabetes
and those who were unfit on the day they were diagnosed, were invited to participate. Based
on these criteria, there were 2,626 possible participants who had visited outpatient clinics
and received medical care for 6 months. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of each participant&#x02019;s hospital. In this study, we surveyed the management of the
1,263 type 2 diabetic patients of 13 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea according to
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Using medical records, we investigated socio-economic data, disease-related data, blood
sampling tests, prescription drugs, co-morbidities and complications. We developed and used
a questionnaire based on previous study. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height
(m) squared. To understand the management, we checked the results of angiography and
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipid, fasting blood sugar, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and
microalbuminuria test which are the indexes for blood sugar management. We also investigated
behavioral treatment, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, insulin with an oral hypoglycemic
agent and insulin pumps in the case of diabetes treatment. For comorbid medication, we
investigated hypertension drugs, anticoagulation agents and anti-lipidemic agents. We
investigated the 1&#x02005;year results, and if there were no records or the records were one or
more years old, the patient was considered to have had no check-up. For the appropriate
metabolic control level, we checked the blood sugar level, blood pressure, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &#x0003c; 100&#x02005;mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein, and serum lipid
level. We followed the target standards of the ADA which were the HbA1c &#x0003c; 7.0%, blood
pressure &#x0003c; 130/80 mmHg, cholesterol (HDL-C) &#x0003e; 40&#x02005;mg/dL (male) or 55&#x02005;mg/dL (female),
and triglyceride &#x0003c; 150&#x02005;mg/dL<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Regarding complications, we included only those diagnosed based on the patients&#x02019; medical
records. For complications, we counted cases in which patients had related drug
prescriptions even if there was no diagnosis and cases in which there were diseases
diagnosed based on the patients&#x02019; medical records. If the patients had received education at
other institutions, the education was excluded because of lack of clear records and quality
control. When patients were medicated with hypertension- and dyslipidemia-related drugs, we
whether or not there were medical records. All cancers were included.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (v. 12.0&#x02005;K, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). The results were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and
number (percent). The general and clinical characteristics of the patients in the exercise
and non-exercise groups, including age, height, weight, and others results, were analyzed
with the independent t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p
&#x0003c; 0.05. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients were used to assess the relation between
metabolic regulation (blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and
HDL and LDL cholesterol) and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, univariate
logistic regression was used to assess the associations between achievement of goals for
metabolic regulation of medical characteristics and complications and exercise in patients
with type 2 diabetes. The odds ratios for each factor in each model were calculated with
Wald-type 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Characteristics of the study population were analyzed (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General and clinical characteristics of the patients in the exercise and

health including the digestive, cardiovascular, renal, optic, and neural systems. For type 2
diabetes, the three major sources of therapy are adjustment of food intake, pharmacological
therapy, and exercise. Among them, exercise makes up an important part of diabetes
management and ameliorates the health of patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim
of present study was to investigate the current evidence for the effect of exercise on
glycemic control, lipid profile, body composition, vascular health, and complications in a
number of patients with type 2 diabetes to understand the apparent relations between
exercise and health.</p><p>Diabetes affects both body mass and muscle quality, due to poor vascular supply and
peripheral neuropathy<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
characteristics of the study population, there was a significant difference in only BMI
between the exercise and non-exercise groups in the present results. The BMI value
represents a highly important risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and exercise adjusts the BMI
by reducing visceral fat and increasing the fat-free mass<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Our results showed an association between metabolic regulation variables and exercise
management. Most metabolic regulation variables had associations with exercise. Exercise
management was associated with a decrease in SBP, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose,
HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL. Umpierre et al. demonstrated that aerobic
exercise intervention improved HbA1c by 0.73%<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is well known that aerobic exercise enhances
glycemic control, raising it to a moderate level<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Endurance exercise helps to decrease LDL-C, however, it had no
impact on HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, in the present results concerning exercise and achievement of goals for metabolic
regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes, significant odds ratios were observed for the
effect of exercise treatment on blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose,
HbA1c, triglyceride, HDL in men, and BMI in the patients with type 2 diabetes. These results
are related to the effect of exercise through the regulation of energy metabolism in type 2
diabetes. Exercise induces a change in fuel usage by working muscle from nonesterified fatty
acids to a blend of nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and muscle glycogen<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. During exercise, the neuroendocrine
system would control fuel mobilization<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These changes induce a decrease in insulin secretion and increase in glucagon,
catecholamine, and cortisol secretion. Moreover, these neural and endocrine changes cause
deficits in fuel availability, neural activity from the acting limb, visceral organs, and
baroreceptor control of heart rate<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
exercise-induced increase in glucagon evokes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis as well as
hepatic amino metabolism and fat oxidation. The decrease in insulin is essential to the full
glycogenolytic response during exercise. The exercise-induced increase in endogenous glucose
production is important in regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in our results concerning exercise and complication incidence in patients with
type 2 diabetes, exercise management was associated with decreased occurrence of
cerebrovasculopathy. Previous studies reported that aerobic exercise had valuable effects on
metabolic parameters such as glycemic control, fasting blood glucose level, and the lipid
profile, and decreased the risk factors in type 2 diabetes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also improved endothelial function and vascular complications by
reducing arterial stiffness<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that exercise was associated with metabolic regulation of
glycemic control, the lipid profile, and body composition, as well as vascular health and
complications, in 1,263 Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. These results from this
large-scale study could explain the apparent relations between exercise and diabetic health.
Therefore, these facts imply that exercise leads to a more healthy life and reduces
disorders and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. More research related to the
importance of exercise in terms of its various beneficial aspects is needed for people with
type 2 diabetes in other countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from the Korean Association of Diabetes Nurse
