The mean percentage increment was 130% in the white matter, 47% in the gray matter, and uniform across brain regions. In the MS group, the nonoxidized fraction measured using [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate was 86% higher. Brain fatty acid uptake measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA-PET was associated with age, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index.

Both brain FFA uptake and metabolism are currently insufficiently defined, whereas the importance of FFAs in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MS) is demonstrated widely in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Animal studies have demonstrated that hypothalamic sensing of circulating fatty acids in general is believed to be important in controlling nutrient intake and, thus, energy balance. For example, Pocai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) showed that manipulation of central hypothalamic FFA metabolism normalizes energy and glucose homeostasis in overfed rats. These regulatory processes are difficult to address in humans in vivo, and most data in this regard have been demonstrated in small animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). More work is needed to clarify the mechanisms behind the complex hypothalamic regulatory circuitry that regulates energy expenditure and feeding behavior.</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) and other methods have been used to evaluate the fate of long-chain saturated fatty acid carbon-labeled-palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). PET provides a method for noninvasive, quantitative, and regional measurement of FFA uptake, thus making it ideal for studying metabolism in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The status of brain FFA metabolism in MS is currently unknown. Therefore, our aim was to use PET to examine possible difference in the brain FFA-uptake rates between MS patients and healthy individuals.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects.</title><p>Twenty-three subjects with MS (age 43 &#x000b1; 7 years, BMI 33.6 &#x000b1; 4.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 8 men and 15 women) and 7 age-matched healthy men (age 42 &#x000b1; 11 years, BMI 26.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were recruited, mostly from an occupational healthy service clinic. Healthy patients were nonobese and had normal oral glucose tolerance test results, whereas the 23 MS patients had MS according to the current International Diabetes Federation criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). According to the criteria, a person defined as having MS must have central obesity, defined as increased waist circumference plus at least two other additional criteria (raised triglycerides/blood pressure/fasting glucose or reduced HDL). Subjects were told to use no alcohol during the study period. Smoking was an exclusion criterion. Only 1 of 23 subjects with MS used medication (ACE inhibitor for blood pressure). Written informed consents were obtained after explaining the purpose and potential risks of the study to the subjects. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and conducted according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Baseline anthropometric and metabolic characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metabolic syndrome</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthy</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> (female/male)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (15/8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (0/7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, years</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43 &#x000b1; 7</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42 &#x000b1; 11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, kg</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.7 &#x000b1; 12.1</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.9 &#x000b1; 8.6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.009</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.6 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0003</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fasting glucose, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">109.8 &#x000b1; 12.6</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">97.2 &#x000b1; 3.6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OGTT glucose, 60 min, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.6 &#x000b1; 54.0</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">176.4 &#x000b1; 12.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OGTT glucose, 120 min, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">129.6 &#x000b1; 52.2</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.8 &#x000b1; 19.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fasting insulin, mU/l</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.8 &#x000b1; 2.6</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9 &#x000b1; 1.6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total cholesterol, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">185.6 &#x000b1; 34.8</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.1 &#x000b1; 23.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HDL cholesterol, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 &#x000b1; 11.6</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 &#x000b1; 7.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Triglycerides, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">115.1 &#x000b1; 53.1</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.6 &#x000b1; 53.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDL cholesterol, mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112.1 &#x000b1; 34.8</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.5 &#x000b1; 23.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HOMA index</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn fn-type="other"><p>Data are mean &#x000b1; SD unless otherwise indicated.

The main finding of the study is that patients with MS have higher FFA uptake in the brain compared with healthy subjects. Weight loss reduced FFA uptake more in healthy subjects, and this was more due to decreased FFA oxidation rather than decreased metabolic FFA utilization.</p><p>We and others have previously used [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA and PET to quantify regional FFA metabolism, especially in myocardium and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Recently we showed that [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA accumulates in the brain in significant amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), thus making it a reliable tracer to quantify brain FFA uptake. The brain tissue-input ratio for [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA ratio was high, suggesting that [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates persistently and in measurable amounts. More than half of the tracer was going into the lipids, and less than half into the breakdown products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These breakdown products likely represent oxidation, so the study results suggest that [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA reflects total uptake. [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate has been shown to accumulate in monkey brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and the extracted fraction is independent of cerebral flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Palmitate accumulation in the brain has also been verified in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and the flux is proportional to published values for regional brain oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Long-chain saturated fatty acids such as [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate enter, to a large extent (50&#x02013;60%), via &#x003b2;-oxidation in mitochondria, creating radioactive, aqueous metabolites, particularly glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate, whereas the other half is incorporated into lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). After the fast oxidation of [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate, the remaining radioactivity thus enters the stable lipid pool of the brain representing nonoxidative residual. It has been suggested that 83% of brain radioactivity is in stable compartments within 2 min after a steady-state level of plasma palmitate is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Plasma [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate activity in our study was stable shortly after 5 min in each person. Because the analysis was done using time frames of 10&#x02013;20 min, the palmitate results from brain can be considered to represent incorporation to stable compartments, and thus the so-called nonoxidative residual. We speculate that by combining the information from [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA and [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate, it may be possible to estimate the brain FFA oxidative component as the difference between total and nonoxidative fatty acid uptake ([<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA minus [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate). From our in vivo validation study, we found that both [<sup>13</sup>C]-palmitate and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA are incorporated into the brain in measurable amounts. The percentage found in the brain hydrophilic and lipid pool did not differ between tracers, whereas a difference was seen in distribution within the lipid pool. From both tracers, we found that more than 60% were found in the lipid pool; [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA was mainly in triglycerides, whereas [<sup>13</sup>C]-palmitate was mainly recovered from phospholipids. The conversion of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA to phospholipids might be different because of steric or charge hindrance. However, the in vivo validation was to show that both tracers are stored in the brain in similar amounts. The distribution of tracers within lipid pool itself is not addressed since PET cannot distinguish between these storage forms.</p><p>The brain uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA and [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate was increased in patients with MS compared with healthy individuals. The difference with [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA was not uniformly increased in all brain areas. The total FFA uptake was significantly greater in the white matter among subjects with MS compared with healthy controls, and the increment appeared to be of larger magnitude than that in the gray matter. The increase in white matter [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake could contribute to previous findings of brain white matter expansion among obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The difference with [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate between groups was more uniform and thus statistically significant in all analyzed areas. The hypothalamic area, now associated with fatty acid sensing and regulation of energy balance and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), had also increased uptake of both [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA. Weight loss reduced the [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake uniformly in all brain regions, including the hypothalamus. It is hypothesized that reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake simultaneously with no change in [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate uptake might reflect reduction in brain FFA oxidative component. This result is in line with a recent rodent study in which inhibition of hypothalamic &#x003b2;-oxidation normalized the energy homeostasis of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, the changes in the oxidative component seem to be related more to weight control and satiety, supporting our finding that oxidative metabolism is different in the obese MS group and could be partially reversed by weight loss. There was no statistically significant difference in nonoxidative storage component after weight loss, but the change in [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate uptake was highly variable between individuals. The reason why a decrease was seen in [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake but not in [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate could be that oxidative metabolism might be more flexible in nature, whereas the synthesis of complex lipids may be more preserved due to its important structural role in the brain. In addition, these studies were conducted under fasting conditions, which are characterized by activation of FFA oxidative metabolism. This may also help explain why intervention-related differences in this process are more easily identified than those in storage. The dieting period did not affect fasting plasma FFA levels, thus multiplying image data with individual FFA level does not contribute to the observed decrease in FFA uptake.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with recent studies implicating the role of hypothalamic fatty acid sensing and their role in the regulation of feeding, energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and peripheral physiologic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The normalization of hypothalamic lipid sensing has been linked to normalization of energy and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). From our study results, it seems that the normal catabolic effect of central FFAs is disturbed in obesity, and this is at least partially reversible after weight loss. Peripheral insulin resistance contributing to MS could also affect the brain. In healthy pigs, hyperinsulinemia induced &#x0223c;20&#x02013;50% decrease in brain [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA radioactivity compared with fasting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The hypothesized central insulin resistance could interfere with brain glucose utilization, thus resulting in compensatory increased FFA uptake and FFA oxidation. Weight loss is known to improve insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The beneficial effect of weight loss was observed in our study among MS patients; in addition to beneficial peripheral effects, FFA uptake in the brain was uniformly decreased due to a decrease in FFA oxidation. The correlations from our study corroborate this line of interference: FFA uptake was positively correlated with BMI, plasma insulin, and HOMA-index; among these, BMI had the strongest correlation. Brain FFA uptake also increased with ageing, suggesting that ageing is related to degenerative changes in the metabolic processes, and reinforcing the theory that age is a risk factor for MS.</p><p>Given that the activation of hypothalamic nuclei can result in changes in sympathetic tone, and that hypothalamus is a key regulator in feeding and energy balance, it is interesting to hypothesize that central FFAs could contribute to increased sympathetic tone in obesity. Previous studies support both positive and negative effects of central lipids in sympathetic tone. It has been reported that central lipid infusion resulting in increased brain lipids might modulate sympathoadrenal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), and that intracerebrovascular infusion of fatty acids might lower sympathetic activity. Unfortunately, we did not have any direct measurements to address this question.</p><p>Limitations in this study were the small number of subjects in the healthy control group and the fact that all of the healthy subjects were males. If sex is used in the statistical model as a covariate, the group difference in [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake persists in the white matter (group &#x000d7; region: F = 6.72, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007; main effect of group in the white matter: F = 4.92, <italic>P</italic> = 0.037), but not in other brain regions, and no significant effects are seen with [<sup>18</sup>F]-palmitate. In addition, female patients with MS had higher uptake values for both radioligands than male patients with MS. Future studies including healthy females should establish whether a significant interaction exists between sex and disease status, such that female patients may be more severely affected than male patients, as current data suggest. However, we think that a simple confounding main effect of sex is unlikely to explain the current results, based on three facts. First, [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA uptake is increased in MS in white matter even when sex is taken into account. Second, significant correlations were seen between fatty acid uptake and clinical variables, such as BMI and fasting plasma glucose, suggesting that increased fatty acid uptake is more likely related to metabolic abnormalities than sex alone. Third, the significant decrease in fatty acid uptake after weight loss argues against a main effect of sex because such main effect would not be reversible. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the skewed sex distribution as a limitation to the interpretation of the results, and recommend that sex be taken into account in future studies. The number of subjects having MS differs in cross-section versus VLCD intervention. The first phase of the study was only cross-sectional. After having positive results from phase 1, we wanted to study in more detail the possibility that brain FFA uptake is related to weight. The more comprehensive phase two (VLCD intervention) was introduced in the study protocol and the last 16 of 23 subjects took part in this phase. Another limiting factor is that the brain kinetics of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA is not known so well as in other organs and was assumed to be taken up as natural palmitate. Although the in vivo biodistribution of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA in the brain suggests that [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA represents total uptake, it does not prove that it equals uptake of natural FFAs. In our study, the total oxidation of [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate was found to be less than 50%. In the animal studies, it has been found that approximately 60% of the [<sup>11</sup>C]-palmitate enters to &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It is possible that the kinetic properties of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FTHA differ slightly from our assumption, explaining the slight difference between our study and animal studies. Nevertheless, this would not affect the differences found between the two groups. The dosages of injected tracers did not explain the findings, even when weight was taken into account. In addition, the isocaloric diet was not controlled, but the subjects were free to eat what they wanted. So the quality and quantity of the foods probably differ between subjects.</p><p>To conclude, we have found that patients fulfilling the International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome have increased brain FFA uptake when compared with healthy subjects. Weight loss is able to partly reverse this abnormality. These novel findings highlight the possible role of brain FFAs in regulation of body weight. It seems that the normal catabolic effect of central FFAs is disturbed in MS and this is partially reversed after weight loss.</p></sec>
