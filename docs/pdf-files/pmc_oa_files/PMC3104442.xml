However, chest symptoms and ECG abnormalities are frequently atypical or absent in ESRD patients, which may delay diagnosis and adversely affect outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> As a result, the diagnosis of AMI has increasingly depended upon evaluation of blood biomarkers, particularly troponins. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are cardiac regulatory proteins that control the calcium-mediated interaction of actin and myosin. Because of their increased specificity compared with creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and other markers, serum troponins are the preferred marker for diagnosis of AMI.</p><p>Because morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease are extremely high in ESRD patients, sensitive and specific screening tests for diagnosing AMI are needed. However, cTnT is significantly higher than the usual cut-off value (0.1 ng/mL) in many ESRD patients without clinically apparent evidence of AMI, so the specificity of cTnT has been reported to be as low as 46% in long-term hemodialysis patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> A study involving ESRD patients without clinical or ECG evidence of acute ischemia reported up to 71% of patients with increased cTnT using the first generation cTnT assay, and the number declined to 17% when a more cardiac-specific, second generation cTnT assay was used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> However, there has been little data reported on the clinical efficacy of cTnT measured by the third generation assay in patients with ESRD.</p><p>An elevated level of cTnT is also used as a predictive factor for adverse outcomes among asymptomatic dialysis patients. A meta-analysis of 28 studies consisting of 3,931 asymptomatic ESRD patients concluded that elevated cTnT levels were associated with an increased mortality risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> In addition, an increased cTnT independently predicted short-term prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of cTnT in ESRD patients with ACS using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and survival analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>This study included ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with ACS between March 2002 and February 2008 at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in Seoul, Korea.

The third generation cTnT test uses the same monoclonal antibodies (M11.7 and M7) as the second generation test, but is standardized with human recombinant cTnT instead of bovine cTnT. The detection limit and concentration corresponding to the 10% total coefficient of variation of the assay are &#x0003c;0.01 and 0.03 ng/mL, respectively.

In addition, all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of patients whose initial cTnT levels were &#x02265;0.35 ng/mL were much higher than the other groups.</p><p>A cTnT level of 0.1 ng/mL is currently used as the cut-off value for AMIs in the general population. In ESRD patients, however, a number of studies have reported that false positive elevations in cTnT level, even without evidence of myocardial injury, are not uncommon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> Several studies have suggested the following possible reasons for elevated cTnT without myocardial damage: left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, leakage of free cytosolic troponin pool, stretch-mediated troponin release, and impaired renal excretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></p><p>In this study, the summation of sensitivity and specificity of cTnT for AMI in ESRD patients with ACS peaked at 0.35 ng/mL. At a value of 0.1 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 98%, yet the specificity was only 65%. Although AMI is such a serious complication that it is important for the screening test to have high sensitivity, a 35% false positive rate cannot be ignored. Therefore, we suggest that an initial cTnT concentration of 0.35 ng/mL in ESRD patients with ACS is a more appropriate cut-off value for AMI, even though patients with lower levels of cTnT should also be carefully monitored.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of total CK are also elevated in 42% of ESRD patients without myocardial damage,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> and 30-50% of asymptomatic HD patients exhibit an elevation in the CK-MB fraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> Moreover, 18-31% of patients with an ACS have elevated cTnT levels without an increase in the CK-MB fraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> Therefore, we performed survival analyses to confirm the validity of the ROC results. An elevation in serum cTnT levels is a well-known predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic ESRD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> Although the reasons for the association between elevated levels of cTnT and a poor prognosis are not clear, the possibility has been suggested that patients with increased cTnT have diffuse coronary artery disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></p><p>Increased serum troponin levels are highly prognostic for cardiac and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease with ACS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> In the GUSTO-IV trial, elevated cTnT independently predicted the 30-day prognosis in all patients, and patients with creatinine clearance in the lowest quartile (&#x0003c;58 mL/min) also showed poor outcomes;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> however, only 11 of 7,033 patients had severe renal impairment with a creatinine clearance &#x0003c;10 mL/min. In addition, it was reported that elevations in cTnI levels in patients with renal impairment undergoing an evaluation for myocardial ischemia were at substantially higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> We identified elevated cTnT levels in ESRD patients presenting with ACS as an independent predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In this study, patients with an elevated cTnT level&#x02265;0.35 ng/mL had a significantly higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>Based on univariate Cox regression analysis, factors correlated with all-cause mortality were age, diabetes, STEMI, initial serum cTnT, serum albumin, WBC counts, and hsCRP levels. After adjustments, age, diabetes, serum cTnT, and hsCRP levels still had statistical significance. When the patients were divided into four groups according to the initial serum concentration of cTnT, all-cause mortality rate in patients with a moderate increase in cTnT (0.1&#x02264;cTnT&#x0003c;0.35 ng/mL) was not significantly different compared to patients with small (0.01&#x0003c;cTnT&#x0003c;0.1 ng/mL) or large (cTnT&#x02265;0.35 ng/mL) increases in cTnT by log-rank test. However, patients with a cTnT &#x02265;0.35 ng/mL had a significantly worse prognosis than all other groups, showing a higher death rate with a risk ratio of 8.65 compared to patients with a cTnT &#x02264;0.01 ng/mL. Because infection was the second most common cause of mortality, the WBC count and hsCRP level are thought to be significantly correlated with all-cause mortality rate.</p><p>Cardiovascular mortality was associated with age, diabetes, initial serum cTnT, and STEMI based on univariate Cox regression analysis. In the multivariate model, age, serum cTnT, and STEMI were independent predictors for cardiovascular mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for cardiovascular mortality, patients with a large increase in cTnT (&#x02265;0.35 ng/mL) had a greater mortality rate. The hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in patients with a cTnT &#x02265;0.35 ng/mL was 6.01-fold higher than patients with a cTnT &#x02264;0.01 ng/mL. Therefore, an initial serum cTnT level &#x02265;0.35 ng/mL is an independent predictor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, the study was a relatively small-sized retrospective study from a single center. Therefore, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the findings. Second, levels of CK/CK-MB were used as serologic markers for the diagnostic criteria of AMI in this study, and the measurement of CK/CK-MB for diagnosing AMI has some known shortcomings. Of note, we excluded patients with skeletal muscle injuries and defined AMI as a temporal change of CK/CK-MB, rather than a single increased value. Third, we were unable to simultaneously measure serum cTnI levels. cTnT is more frequently elevated than cTnI among asymptomatic patients with renal insufficiency due to the relatively higher levels of an unbound cytosolic pool of cTnT and the higher molecular weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> In addition, time-dependent change of cTnT could not be evaluated due to the lack of repeated measurements of cTnT levels. Finally, we could not obtain data on risk factors, such as hemodynamic status and echocardiographic features, along with medical history, such as smoking habits or family history, due to deficiencies in our database.</p><p>In conclusion, although moderate elevations of cTnT are common in ESRD patients without AMI, measurement of cTnT is useful for diagnosing AMI or predicting outcomes. In addition, ESRD patients with an initial cTnT concentration &#x02265;0.35 ng/mL seem to have a poor prognosis.
