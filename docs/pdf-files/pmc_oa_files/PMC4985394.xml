We collected the information on hypertension medication by asking whether the participants have taken any hypertension medications (yes or no). Clinical examinations, including measurements of weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure were performed by experienced nurses according to a standard protocol. Body mass index was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup> in kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured using an electronic BP monitor (OMRON Model HEM-752 FUZZY; Omron Company, Dalian, China), on the nondominant arm in a seated position after resting for 10 min.

The concentrations of urinary BPA (median value, 0.81&#x0200a;ng/mL; IQR, 0.48&#x02013;1.45&#x0200a;ng/mL) in the present study were low relative to concentrations in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort study (median value, 1.3&#x0200a;ng/mL),<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which reported a positive association between BPA and coronary artery disease in a dose&#x02013;response manner in a longitudinal analysis. Urinary BPA concentrations in our study population also were lower than concentrations reported for other recent study populations (available median values range from 1.20 to 2.30&#x0200a;ng/mL, available mean values range from 1.79 to 6.93&#x0200a;ng/mL).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Different from the Korean study, in the present study, the associations between BPA and hypertension, elevated CIMT and arterial stiffness were negative and in dose&#x02013;response relationship. The most current study by Bae and Hong reported that consuming canned beverage and consequent increase of BPA exposure increased blood pressure acutely in 60 participants (56 women and 4 men) ages 60 years or older. It is an interesting study revealing a relationship between short-term BPA exposure and acute effect on blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The association of chronic BPA exposure with cardiovascular risk is still to be evaluated in further longitudinal study.</p><p>BPA is suspected to have a variety of effects in humans, and its estrogenic action is considered to be 1 of the major mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Estrogen has several important effects on the cardiovascular system.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Estrogen alters the expression or activity of ion channels, contractile proteins, and reactive oxygen species production and all of which may contribute to cardiovascular health.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> It is well-documented that estrogen improves vascular function and reduces atherosclerosis.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Experimental studies of mice have indicated that the atheroprotection is mediated by estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> which have important roles in repairing blood vessels and controlling blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Estrogen is also important for maintaining and repairing the endothelium. This process appears to involve an estrogen mediated increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In humans, the incidence of cardiovascular disease differs widely among men and women, partly because of the variations in hormones.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Studies have found that the incidence of cardiovascular disease is usually low in premenopausal women and tends to increase in postmenopausal women, however, in postmenopausal women who receive estrogen therapy, the incidence can be reduced to premenopausal levels.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Thus it is biologically possible that exogenous estrogen may have protective effects on hypertension and early macrovascular diseases.</p><p>The exact mechanisms by which BPA exposure may affect the cardiovascular system are not fully understood. Experimental studies of rats and in vitro reported that BPA affects cardiovascular system mainly through inducing liver and oxidative cellular damage,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> disrupting pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and promoting obesity and insulin resistance.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although hypertension and early macrovascular diseases are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, experimental evidence of mice and in vitro suggested that BPA also acts on cardiovascular system through a series of other ways, including inducing obesity, diabetes, and hormone and lipids dysfunctions.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been suggested that the actions of estrogen and its receptors in the cardiovascular system differ by sex and age.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In the present study, we observed that negative association of BPA with elevated CIMT were stronger in magnitude among those &#x02265;60 versus &#x0003c;60 years of age. Although it is plausible to speculate that as an exogenous estrogen, BPA may affect the cardiovascular system by mimicking estrogen, future research is needed to give a more clear demonstration on behavior of BPA in humans.</p><p>The strength of the present study included the large sample size, and the understudied population. The present study has several limitations. Firstly, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we cannot establish that BPA exposure precedes hypertension and early macrovascular diseases. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the chronic effect of BPA exposure on health outcomes. Secondly, we did not collect data on diet behavior, and the specific hypertension medication categories or dose. Thus, confounding by diet or medication cannot be ruled out. Thirdly, the BPA measures are from single spot urine samples, repeated measurements over weeks, months, or even years would improve the evaluation of a long-term exposure. Mahalingaiah et al<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> measured urinary BPA concentrations in 217 samples collected over weeks to months from 82 participants attending a fertility clinic in the United States. The authors reported that 63% of participants classified into the highest tertile of the geometric mean concentration of all samples would have been correctly classified based on a single urine sample. Fourthly, due to a generally lower level of BPA exposure in this population, it might be less likely to detect any possibly positive association between BPA and cardiovascular risk than in a population with a wider range of possible exposure levels. Fifthly, our study participants were restricted to middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. Therefore, age, race, and the BPA exposure levels should be considered when generalizing the findings to other populations. Further studies in prospective cohorts are warranted to verify our findings in other demographic or ethnic populations.</p><p>In contrast with previously published studies, our study suggested negative relationships between BPA exposure and hypertension, elevated CIMT, and arterial stiffness in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults. Much about the actions of BPA on cardiovascular functions in humans remain unknown, and well-designed longitudinal studies including a wide range of BPA exposure levels, ages, and genders are imperative for confirming associations and understanding the mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ABI = Ankle-Brachial Index, ba-PWV = brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, BPA = bisphenol A, CI = confidence intervals, CIMT = carotid intima-media thickness, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, IQR = interquartile range, LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, OR = odds ratio, PAD = peripheral artery disease, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SD = standard deviation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>TW and MX contributed equally to this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the grants 2013BAI09B13 from the National Clinical Research Center for Metabolic Diseases, 81321001, 81390350, 81222008, 81471059, 81130016, and 81500610 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Shanghai Municipal of Science and Technology (13495810200), Shu Guang Project of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation (12SG21), SMC-Chen Xing Young Scholars Program of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2012), the &#x02018;Yang Fan Project for Young Scientist&#x02019; of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (15YF1410100), and the Youth Scientific Research Project of Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission (20144Y0109).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kelland</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group>
