Here we show that Nav1.7 expression in different sets of mouse sensory and sympathetic neurons underlies distinct types of pain sensation. Ablating Nav1.7 gene (<italic>SCN9A</italic>) expression in all sensory neurons using Advillin-Cre abolishes mechanical pain, inflammatory pain and reflex withdrawal responses to heat. In contrast, heat-evoked pain is retained when <italic>SCN9A</italic> is deleted only in Nav1.8-positive nociceptors. Surprisingly, responses to the hotplate test, as well as neuropathic pain, are unaffected when <italic>SCN9A</italic> is deleted in all sensory neurons. However, deleting <italic>SCN9A</italic> in both sensory and sympathetic neurons abolishes these pain sensations and recapitulates the pain-free phenotype seen in humans with <italic>SCN9A</italic> loss-of-function mutations. These observations demonstrate an important role for Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons in neuropathic pain, and provide possible insights into the mechanisms that underlie gain-of-function Nav1.7-dependent pain conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms1795-i1.jpg"/>Sodium channel Nav1.7 is essential for acute human pain but its role in chronic neuropathic pain is unclear.

Voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 are expressed in peripheral neurons and have been linked to pain pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The biophysical characteristics of Nav1.7 suggest a role in initiating action potentials in response to depolarization of sensory neurons by noxious stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Nav1.8 is a major contributor to the upstroke of action potentials in sensory neurons and is essential for cold pain perception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Nav1.9 influences inflammatory pain thresholds by producing a persistent current that helps determine the resting membrane potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Rare human genetic conditions involving Nav1.7 mutations demonstrate its important role in pain pathways. Dominant gain-of-function mutations can cause primary erythromelalgia, resulting in burning pain and flushing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Mutations associated with the condition, for example F1449V<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and L858H<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, result in lower thresholds for action potential firing and higher-frequency firing in sensory neurons. Other gain-of-function Nav1.7 mutations that cause defective fast inactivation may cause burning pain associated with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), in which mechanical stimulation triggers pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Loss-of-function recessive mutations cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) and anosmia; individuals with this syndrome are of normal intelligence and can function effectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These observations highlight Nav1.7 as a potentially useful target for the development of novel analgesics.</p><p>Early studies on Nav1.7 function in transgenic mice focused on the role of this channel in Nav1.8-positive nociceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Deletion of the <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene in these neurons results in a loss of sensitivity to high-threshold noxious mechanical stimuli and major deficits in inflammatory pain. Unlike humans with global loss-of-function mutations, however, there is no deficit in noxious thermosensation. Here we have used Cre recombinase expressed in different sets of sensory and sympathetic neurons to explore modality-specific pain sensations that are dependent on the expression of Nav1.7. Advillin is an actin-binding protein that is selectively expressed within all trigeminal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We used Cre driven by the Advillin promoter to delete Nav1.7 in all sensory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and compared phenotypes with mice in which Nav1.7 is deleted using Cre driven by Nav1.8 in a subpopulation of sensory neurons (<italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Wnt1 is expressed in neural crest cells that are the precursors of sensory and autonomic neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This has allowed us to exploit a Wnt1-Cre mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> to examine the contribution of Nav1.7 to pain behaviour in both the sensory and sympathetic neurons, where it is selectively expressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. We have thus been able to define the pain modalities associated with different sets of peripheral neurons that express Nav1.7. We provide evidence that Nav1.7 may be involved at both the central as well as the peripheral terminals of sensory neurons in pain signalling. We also demonstrate an interaction between sympathetic and primary sensory neurons in acute heat sensing as well as neuropathic pain, which are both dependent upon Nav1.7 activity. These experiments provide a comprehensive mouse model of human CIP for mechanistic studies and reinforce the significance of Nav1.7 as an analgesic drug target.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pan-DRG neuron gene ablation with an Advillin-Cre mouse</title><p>The expression pattern of functional Cre was first examined by crossing an Advillin-Cre knock-in-positive mouse line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> with Rosa26 floxed-stop &#x003b2;-galactosidase-expressing reporter mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.

Finally, pain behaviour in response to noxious thermal stimuli applied to the hindpaw(s) was also normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j&#x02013;l</xref>). Behavioural responses to both short- and long-term inflammatory pain models were also normal in <italic>Advillin-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;e</xref>). Similarly, mechanical sensitivity developed normally in response to surgically induced neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The same acute pain tests as described above were performed on <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>-expressing mice, which showed responses similar to wild-type littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a&#x02013;f</xref>).

Analysis of the behavioural responses of <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup>
<italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> and <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Wnt1</italic></sup> mice in a number of different pain models showed that their pain phenotypes differ. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> shows that all three Nav1.7 knockout mouse strains show pronounced analgesia in terms of noxious mechanosensation measured with a Randall&#x02013;Selitto apparatus, when compared with their littermate controls. This confirms the findings of Nassar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, who examined the <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup> mouse. The Randall&#x02013;Selitto test results suggest that deleting Nav1.7 within Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons is sufficient to abolish responses to mechanical pain. However, the results of the acetone (noxious cooling) test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and Hargreaves' (thermal: spinal withdrawal reflex) test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) show deficits in the <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> and <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Wnt1</italic></sup> mice, while the behavioural response of <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup> was not significantly different from littermate controls (confirmed by separate behavioural tests&#x02014;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a,b</xref>). Thus, noxious cooling-evoked behaviour and spinal withdrawal reflexes to noxious heat require Nav1.7 expression in Nav1.8-negative sensory neurons. However, this is not true for supraspinal responses to the hotplate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>&#x02014;discussed below). Other work supports the view that Nav1.7 expressed within Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons contributes little to thermal nociceptive processing. Abrahamsen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> showed that behavioural responses to noxious thermal stimuli (with the exception of extreme cold) remain intact in mice in which all Nav1.8-positive neurons have been ablated with diphtheria toxin (<italic>Nav1.8</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup>). Additionally, <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings from spinal lamina V wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup>
<italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup> and <italic>Nav1.8</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup> mice corroborate the behavioural data. Critically, WDR responses in <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> mice show that both noxious heat and mechanical stimuli are attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). In contrast, only mechanically evoked and not heat-evoked WDR responses are attenuated in both <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and <italic>Nav1.8</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This demonstrates clearly that Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons is essential for processing noxious mechanical stimuli while Nav1.7 in Nav1.8-negative DRG neurons is essential for processing noxious thermal stimuli.</p><p>Nav1.7 is expressed in sympathetic as well as sensory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. By using the Wnt1 promoter to drive Cre expression it is possible to delete genes in neural crest derivatives including autonomic and sensory neurons. Therefore, we could identify any role for Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons by comparing the phenotype of <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> and <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Wnt1</italic></sup> mice. Interestingly, only <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Wnt1</italic></sup> mice have an attenuated response to the hotplate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), which is a measure of supra-spinal responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> to damaging thermal stimuli rather than a spinal reflex involving only cells in the spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In contrast, <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> (as well as <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup>) mice show normal hotplate pain behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). However, this does not mean that Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons alone confers sensitivity to the hotplate test. Chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> in wild-type mice has no effect on behavioural responses to the hotplate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>) or any other acute pain thresholds tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a&#x02013;f</xref>). However, when chemical sympathectomy is combined with the deletion of sensory neuron Nav1.7 in <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> mice, the hotplate response is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Thus, only when Nav1.7 expression is lost in both sensory and sympathetic neurons do mice become unresponsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Despite the role of the sympathetic nervous system in thermoregulation, the core temperature and skin temperature of <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Wnt1</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and 6-OHDA-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5g</xref>) were found to be normal.</p><p>We next examined the responses of the three Nav1.7 knockout lines to noxious cold stimuli, and compared them with a global Nav1.8 knockout mouse that is known to lose sensitivity to noxious cold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Interestingly, the Nav1.8 knockout mouse responded to acetone-induced cooling in the same way as littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), but showed an attenuated response to extreme cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, all three Nav1.7 conditional knockout mouse lines that showed attenuated responses to acetone-induced cooling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) avoided extreme cold like their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, noxious cold sensation is not Nav1.7 dependent. Finally, all three Nav1.7 knockout mouse lines showed normal responses to light touch and motor coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), reinforcing the link between Nav1.7 and pain rather than innocuous somatosensation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Substance P release from DRG neurons is Nav1.7 dependent</title><p>The functional consequences of deleting Nav1.7 in DRG neurons were further examined electrophysiologically. <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Advill</italic></sup> DRG neurons showed a significant average reduction in tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium current amplitude, whereas TTX-resistant sodium currents were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

In these experiments, neuropathic pain was established for 28 days, followed by chemical sympathectomy. A substantial, if incomplete, reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity was observed consistent with a sympathetic sensory interaction contribution to the establishment of neuropathic pain. These results may help explain the apparent utility of Nav1.7 antagonists in treating neuropathic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The apparently normal phenotype of humans with <italic>SCN9A</italic> loss-of-function mutations, apart from anosmia and loss of pain sensation, has focused attention on Nav1.7 as a plausible analgesic drug target. Ablation of the channel using the Cre-loxP system in mice leads to silencing of a significant set of sensory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We found that TTX-sensitive current densities were reduced in sensory neurons that no longer express Nav1.7. More surprisingly, we found that substance P release into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord evoked by electrical stimulation was completely abolished in the absence of Nav1.7, leading to a loss of wind-up and centrally mediated pain sensitization. In the olfactory system, Weiss <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> have shown that while olfactory neurons support action potential propagation in the absence of Nav1.7, the release of neurotransmitter from olfactory neurons is completely abolished, leading to anosmia. A similar deficit may occur in DRG sensory neurons. Thus, Nav1.7 may contribute to pain signalling by DRG neurons in three ways: (1) by recruiting Nav1.8 to transmit noxious input into the spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; (2) by supporting action potential propagation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and (3) by regulating neurotransmitter release at central terminals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>In terms of responses to innocuous stimuli and motor function, the ablation of Nav1.7 in all sensory and sympathetic neurons is without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). However, threshold withdrawal behavioural responses to noxious pressure require Nav1.7 in a set of sensory neurons that express Nav1.8. This corroborates previous findings in <italic>Nav1.7</italic><sup><italic>Nav1.8</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and <italic>Nav1.8</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Reflex threshold withdrawal responses to noxious heat are dependent on Nav1.7 expression in a different set of sensory neurons that do not express Nav1.8, an observation consistent with cell ablation studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Noxious cold is the sole pain modality that is Nav1.7 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), confirming a previously described role for Nav1.8, which is sensitized at low temperatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Responses to noxious cooling associated with the application of acetone, however, are not dependent on Nav1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), but depend upon Nav1.7 expression in Nav1.8-negative sensory neurons.</p><p>Acute pain has a clear survival function. Inflammatory pain has a positive role in enhancing self-protection and wound healing, but may cause considerable suffering in chronic inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. It has been established that Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive neurons has an essential role in inflammatory pain. Interestingly, thermal hyperalgesia, but not threshold noxious heat sensing, is mediated by Nav1.7 in the Nav1.8-positive population. This observation confirms that distinct cells and wiring patterns are associated with acute and sensitized thermosensation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref> summarizes the relationship between different types of pain sensation and the expression patterns of sodium channels Nav1.7 and Nav1.8.</p><p>One of the least understood and most problematic aspects of pain remains neuropathic pain. This may be because a variety of different mechanisms sensitize pain pathways after nerve damage. Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive nociceptors is not required for the development of neuropathic pain in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and the studies reported here show that Nav1.7 deletion in all sensory neurons also does not significantly impair the development of neuropathic pain. As the number of CIP patients is very limited, there is no information on the importance of Nav1.7 for the development of neuropathic pain in humans. We wondered if Nav1.7 in the sympathetic nervous system contributed to neuropathic pain, as early studies in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> had made a compelling case for a sympathetic contribution to this type of pain. Interestingly, ablation of Nav1.7 in both sensory and sympathetic neurons markedly diminished neuropathic pain in the SNT model investigated here<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This observation demonstrates an interaction between sympathetic and sensory neurons to produce neuropathic pain that is represented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>. Interestingly, pain behaviour evoked by the hotplate test is also dependent on Nav1.7 in sympathetic and sensory neurons. Behavioural responses to the hotplate test have been shown to be supraspinally integrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. A number of experimental manipulations specifically affect the hotplate behavioural response, but not reflex heat-evoked behaviour (typically tail-flick)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Animals in which nerve growth factor (NGF) depletion leads to loss of sensory and sympathetic neurons also show a loss of hotplate sensitivity while mechanical thresholds and thermal reflex behaviour are unaffected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. NGF is not required for the survival of parasympathetic neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. This is consistent with a role for sympathetic neurons rather than other autonomic neurons in this pain behaviour. Silencing sympathetic and some sensory neurons by deleting VGLUT2 with Cre recombinase driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter also causes a loss of hotplate sensitivity while acute mechanical pain remains intact<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In contrast, selectively deleting VGLUT2 using Nav1.8-Cre results in a behavioural phenotype where mechanical pain behaviour is lost while thermal pain remains intact<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. These findings directly mirror the behavioural phenotypes associated with selective deletion of Nav1.7 within different neuronal subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>The role of the sympathetic nervous system in pain pathways has been confirmed in some rat models of neuropathic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Clinical studies have also shown a role for the sympathetic nervous system in acute human pain, for example, post-surgical pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. General interest in the role of the sympathetic nervous system in pain pathways has diminished because sympathetic block has little effect in many human studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Our results suggest that a combination of sensory and sympathetic block may prove to be more effective in treating some pain states than a sensory block alone, perhaps because complete sensory block may be hard to achieve. How sympathetic and sensory neurons interact to enhance pain sensations is unclear; interactions at nerve terminals, cell bodies and centrally have all been invoked as possible mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Interactions between sympathetic neurons and the neuronal somata of DRG neurons (Dogiel's arborizations) have been described in normal animals since the era of Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Sprouting and specific interactions with sensory neurons by sympathetic neurons have been observed in several chronic pain models and recently quantitated with reporter mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Complex regional pain syndrome characterized by chronic burning pain and flushing in limbs supports the view that sympathetic input may contribute to pain, although the role of Nav1.7 has not been explored in this condition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>How do these findings relate to known human Nav1.7-dependent pain pathologies? It is striking that the principal sensation associated with all gain-of-function Nav1.7 mutations is burning pain. A possible explanation for this is that the heat-sensing subset of Nav1.7-expressing (Nav1.8 negative) sensory neurons show lower thresholds of activation than the Nav1.7-expressing Nav1.8-positive set of classical nociceptors linked to noxious mechanosensation. Interestingly, sympathetic block is effective in the treatment of some erythromelalgia cases, consistent with a contribution by sympathetic neurons to acute heat sensing (Bang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and references therein). Overexpression studies of gain-of-function Nav1.7 erythromelalgia-associated mutant channels in SCG neuronal somata have shown diminished excitability of sympathetic neurons, although it is unclear if lower physiological levels of Nav1.7 expression also silence sympathetic neurons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><p>PEPD is also characterized by a burning pain evoked principally by mechanical stimuli. The association of PEPD with paroxysms of rectal, ocular or sub-mandibular pain with flushing could be related to the sympathetic contribution to this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> The Harlequin-like nature of flushing also implicates the autonomic nervous system (see, for example, Drummond and Lance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Age-related alterations in autonomic nervous system function could also be a factor in time of onset of primary erythromelalgia, which is remarkably variable in different patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Finally, the ability to abolish all pain modalities in mice that fail to express Nav1.7 in the periphery provide a useful model of CIP for mechanistic studies, and confirms the utility of mouse models of human disease for mechanistic studies. These data confirm the potential of Nav1.7 as an analgesic drug target not only for acute and inflammatory pain but also for neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cre expression</title><p>Cre expression was visualized using Rosa26 floxed-stop &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.
