turnover rate of physical therapists. It should help create efficient personnel and
organization management by exploring the impact of the work environment and work-related
stress on turnover intention and analyzing the correlation between them. [Subjects and
Methods] A survey was conducted with 236 physical therapists working at medical
institutions in the Daejeon and Chungcheong areas. For the analysis on the collected data,
correlational and linear regression analyses were conducted using the SPSS 18.0 program
and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient. [Results] The results showed a statistically significant
positive correlation between turnover intention and work-related stress but a
statistically significant negative correlation respectively between turnover intention and
work environment. Work-related stress (&#x003b2;=0.415) had a significant positive impact on
turnover intention and work environment (&#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.387) had a significant negative impact on
turnover intention. [Conclusion] To increase satisfaction level with the profession as
well as the workplace for physical therapists, improvement of the work environment was the
most necessary primary improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Intention</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Due to the nature of the job, physical therapists provide medical services in close
relationships with patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The turnover of physical therapists is a major loss in
quality improvement of health services and rehabilitation related to human resources<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, medical services are moving from healthcare provider-centered to
patient-centered and hospitals are also converting into patient-centered healthcare
systems<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, hospital
organizations are recognizing recruitment, training, and retraining for healthcare providers
in each specialized field<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To provide good quality health services, healthcare providers&#x02019; beliefs in significantly
contributing to patient care and their own work satisfaction should be preceded<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Emotional labor refers to the idea of
suppressing and limiting emotions to satisfy hospitals&#x02019; changing patient-centered goals and
patients&#x02019; feelings<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A physical therapist is a representative emotional laborer<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stress caused by excessive emotional labor
has a negative effect on workers&#x02019; commitment to the organization and satisfaction toward the
job<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, resulting in work-related stress (WS). The work environment (WE)
of human service workers has also been presented as a major factor in turnovers<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If an organization member leaves the organization due to turnover, ensuring good quality
staffing is threatened; large amounts of money are spent in the selection and training of
new staff, finally resulting in loss to the organization<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, new employees are highly likely to make mistakes or
cause accidents compared to employees with experience. Employee replacement costs are also
much higher than the costs of actually recruiting, hiring, and training new staff<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; therefore, this has negative effects on
the overall health and economic sectors. Byun<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> said in her previous research that promoting efficient task
execution and reducing turnovers by reducing WS and increasing job satisfaction are very
important. For the efficient management of internal employees, it is necessary to accurately
identify job satisfaction and WS and analyze their correlations with turnovers.</p><p>Examining similar research on the correlation between a variety of factors in the workplace
and turnovers within medical institutions, radiological technologists showed higher job
satisfaction with higher annual income and lower working years and showed higher turnovers
depending on the number of working years, wages, and night watch duty<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Age, characteristics of medical institutions in which
they are working, and job satisfaction are related to turnover of occupational
therapists<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For nurses, excellent
nursing is dependent on job satisfaction enabling them to handle work positively and
efficiently; higher job satisfaction reduces turnovers<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reality is that studies related to physical therapists include
studies on WS<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, research on working
conditions and job satisfaction<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>,
empowerment and job satisfaction, research on organizational commitment<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, etc. However, the number is remarkably small compared to
studies targeting other health service workers and the data on turnover intention (TI)
itself as well as studies that analyze the relationship between TI and WE and WS of physical
therapists are very rare.</p><p>Therefore, by investigating the effect of WS and WE on physical therapists and turnover,
this study can provide basic data for reducing the turnover of physical therapists and
seeking effective human resource and organizational management measures in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were 241 physical therapists currently working in medical
institutions who were directly visited during the three months from January to March 2014
for questionnaire distribution and collection. Five questionnaires were miswritten due to
error or insufficient survey answer contents; 236 questionnaires were examined
statistically. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation in this
study. Those who fully comprehended the study procedure and voluntarily agreed to
participate were selected as participants. This study was conducted consistent with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The TI measurement tool used seven questions; for turnover factors, four questions modified
and used by Gang<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> were modified and
reconstructed for this study. The tool is composed of 11 questions. To measure WS, this
study used the questionnaire consisting of 15 questions after modifying and complementing
the method used by Byun<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The WE
measurement tool was reconstructed for this study based on the survey tool reconstructed by
Lim<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. WE was measured with a
questionnaire of 26 questions. Each question on the measurement tool was based on a Likert
scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (strongly agree) points and higher scores meant better WE.
Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha values in a previous and the present study were more than 0.700.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 was used for the collected data and the analysis method is as follows.
Participants&#x02019; general characteristics were shown as frequency and percentage. TI, WS, and WE
of the participants were obtained as means and standard deviations. The data were analyzed
using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient to verify the reliability of questionnaire internal
consistencies. The correlation between TI, WS, and WE used correlation analysis through
Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis to determine the impact of
WS and WE on TI<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significance level
of this study was set as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The participants&#x02019; general characteristics are as follows. There were 106 males (44.9%) and

relationship with patients. In this process, emotional labor of a physical therapist affects
both the therapist and the patient. However, therapists who have previously adapted to the
healthcare system have emphasized only ability and have neglected the emotional aspect<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, psychological factors may
burden poor WE and reduced job involvement and job satisfaction levels<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. To provide the
best care services to patients, physical therapists should continue to have a smooth
interactive relationship with patients, constantly watch the patient condition, and find the
optimum treatment in this process. Thus, physical therapists&#x02019; satisfaction with their job
and working with responsibility are essential elements in increasing treatment efficiency as
well as cementing the relationship with patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the correlations between TI, WS, and WE were analyzed; there was a
statistically significant positive correlation between TI and WS. This was consistent with a
study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> targeting 212 new nurses. TI
and WE had a statistically significant negative correlation; results of a study<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> targeting 290 nurses support the results
of this paper.</p><p>The results of regression analysis on physical therapists&#x02019; TI by WS showed a positive
explanatory power of 41.5% (R<sup>2</sup>=0.415); the size of the influence (&#x003b2;=0.415) shows
that higher WS leads to relatively higher TI. Lim&#x02019;s study targeting 248 nursing teachers
showed 53.6% explanatory power (R<sup>2</sup>=0.536) and influence of &#x003b2;=0.540; WS also
affected TI in other occupations, highly supporting the results of this study<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Heo&#x02019;s study, targeting 353
nurses obtained only 12% explanatory power (influence &#x003b2;=0.36) showing relatively low support
for the results of this study<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the
other hand, satisfaction with WE showed a negative explanatory power of 41.5% of TI
(R<sup>2</sup>=0.415) and the size of the influence was &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.387, indicating that low
satisfaction with WE leads to relatively high TI.</p><p>Other research results include explanatory power of 52.1% (R<sup>2</sup>=0.521), and
influence of &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.229 (working environment), &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.382 (self-development), and &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.263
(working facilities) in Lee&#x02019;s study targeting 236 golf course employees<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>; explanatory power of 53.6% (R<sup>2</sup>=0.536) and
influence of &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.141(relationship with superintendent) and &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.118 (compensation adequacy)
in Lim&#x02019;s study targeting nursing teachers<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>; and explanatory power of 36% (R<sup>2</sup>=0.360) and influence
of &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.228 in Sin&#x02019;s study targeting local hospital nurses<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, WE affected TI in other occupations, showing high support
for the results of this study.</p><p>According to the results of this study, the higher the WS, the higher the TI, and the
better the WE, the lower the TI. In particular, WS had a greater impact on TI than WE. This
is similar to the results of Lim<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Jeong&#x02019;s<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> studies in which WS had the
most significant impact on TI. Therefore, WS becomes the direct cause of turnovers and if
not solved, leads to turnovers. Thus, it is essential to reduce the WS of physical
therapists and improve the WE; ways to reduce turnovers should be sought through this.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that it cannot be generalized to all physical therapists
due to its potential selection bias; physical therapists in Daejeon (Chungcheong), physical
therapists working in rehabilitation hospitals, and young physical therapists were surveyed.
Further, the correlations between various stress factors and WE affecting TI could not be
clearly identified because survey questions were not segmented. In conclusion, future
research including national physical therapists, all medical institutions, and participants
of various ages needs to be conducted. The root cause can be found and solved when
correlations of each factor are identified more clearly through the segmentation of the
survey questions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENSES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sakurai</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanada</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugiura</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of clinical practice focusing on level-3 OSCE
