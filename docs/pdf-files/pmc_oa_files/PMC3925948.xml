It has been hypothesized that the vascular nature of these tumors is the product of reactive angiogenesis. However, recent data indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastoma neoplastic cells originate from embryologically-arrested hemangioblasts capable of blood and endothelial cell differentiation. To determine the origin of tumor vasculature in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas, we analyzed the vascular elements in tumors from VHL patients. We demonstrate that isolated vascular structures and blood vessels within VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are a result of tumor-derived vasculogenesis. Further, similar to hemangioblastomas, we demonstrate that other VHL-associated lesions possess vascular tissue of tumor origin and that tumor-derived endothelial cells emerge within implanted <italic>VHL</italic> deficient UMRC6 RCC murine xenografts. These findings further establish the embryologic, developmentally arrested, hemangioblast as the tumor cell of origin for VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and indicate that it is also the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a progressive multi-system familial tumor syndrome characterized by phenotypically similar vascular tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) and viscera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Characteristic VHL neoplasms include CNS hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), pheochromocytomas and pancreatic cystadenomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

Moreover, VHL-associated tumor cells can evoke blood island formation and differentiate into erythrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as form endothelial cell progeny <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These findings indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are not only capable of extramedullary hematopoiesis but potentially blood vessel development.</p><p>It had been hypothesized that extensive blood vessel formation in VHL-associated tumors was exclusively the result of reactive angiogenesis within a pseudo-hypoxic (pVHL deficient) cellular environment, and secondary to HIF-induced downstream factor production (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and END1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, the discovery of the multipotent hemangioblast as the neoplastic cell in hemangioblastomas suggested that <italic>de novo</italic> formation of new blood vessels directly through stem-like endothelial progenitor cells (hemangioblast cells) could play a role in tumor blood vessel development. To define the origin of the vasculature in VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastomas and other VHL-associated tumors, we characterized their vasculature <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To define the vascular features of CNS hemangioblastomas, we systematically examined hemangioblastomas resected from 6 VHL patients and compared the features to normal cerebellum and spinal cord collected at autopsy from 5 patients with VHL and 3 non-VHL controls. CD31 expression, an endothelial specific cell surface marker, highlighted extensive vascular tissue within hemangioblastoma tumors (in contrast with normal cerebellum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Hemangioblastoma precursors (defined by CA9 and HIF-2&#x003b1; expression in the absence of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> were identified within regions of normal cerebellar tissue in autopsy samples from patients with VHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d,e</xref>). Both hemangioblastomas and precursor lesions demonstrated the presence of numerous small (10 to 50 micron diameter) unperfused CD31 expressing ring-like vascular structures, indicative of sprouting vessel development with lumen formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,f</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the anatomic relationship of the small unperfused intratumoral vascular structures and characterize the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vasculature in VHL-associated tumor, we performed serial-section 3D immunohistochemical analysis of vessels in tumor. Examination of 3D CD31 expression reconstruction in tumors demonstrated the formation of numerous small isolated islands of vascular tissue (10 to 50 microns) independent from the established vascular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1G</xref>). To further define potential differences within the vasculature of VHL-associated tumors, we analyzed hemangioblastoma-associated vessels according to size. Immunohistochemical analysis showed larger vessels (greater than 100 microns) expressed Factor VIII with or without CD31 expression, while small vascular structures almost exclusively expressed CD31. Consistent with previous studies, the absence of Factor VIII expression and pronounced CD31 expression in small vascular structures confirmed the presence of immature proliferative endothelial cells within hemangioblastoma tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>To definitively establish the origin of the small unperfused vascular structures, tissue micro-dissection and extraction was performed of CD31 staining endothelial cells from hemangioblastomas, as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Dissected vascular elements demonstrated marked allelic imbalance, confirming LOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Blood cell samples and large tumor feeding vessels did not exhibit LOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To further confirm this result, FISH with concurrent CD31 immunofluorescence was carried out on hemangioblastoma sections to detect the presence or absence of <italic>VHL</italic> itself. Endothelial cell nuclei within larger vessels (100 microns) displayed retention of both copies of <italic>VHL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Alternatively, small vascular elements (10 to 50 microns) showed one copy of <italic>VHL</italic>, indicating loss of the <italic>wild-type</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f,g</xref>). Complementary LOH and FISH data served to verify that tumor-derived vasculogenesis was taking place within evaluated hemangioblastoma tumors. Large vascular structures also demonstrated some endothelial cells with loss of one copy of <italic>VHL,</italic> consistent with migrating endothelial cells that were recruited during angiogenesis combining with developing <italic>de novo</italic> endothelial cells during tumor blood vessel formation.</p><p>To determine if vessels in other VHL-associated tumors were tumor-derived, we examined vascular elements in other VHL-associated lesions collected at autopsy from 5 VHL patients. Micro-dissected endothelial cells from RCCs, kidney cysts, and pancreatic tumors demonstrated characteristic <italic>VHL</italic> LOH in comparison to non-tumor control vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). To assess the process of VHL-associated tumor vessel formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, subcutaneous implanted UMRC6 (RCC cell-line with <italic>VHL</italic> deletion) xenografts in NOD. Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup></italic>
<italic>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjl</sup></italic>/SzJ mice were surgically extracted at 2 weeks and intratumoral vasculogenesis was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). UMRC6 xenografts presumably demonstrated characteristic VHL-associated tumor phenotype with extensive vascularity and clear-cell appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Small vascular structures developing within xenograft lesions were identified by CD31 staining and extracted by micro-dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Micro-dissected structures demonstrated human genomic (DNA) marker after amplification with <italic>VHL</italic>-flanking chromosome 3 specific primers (D3S1038 and D3S1110), as opposed to control murine muscle tissue that did not amplify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Co-localization by immunofluorescence of human specific HLA markers and non-specific CD31 within the xenografts further established the presence of tumor-derived endothelial cells emerging within the tumor, and indicate that the hemangioblast is presumably the tumor cell of origin in VHL-associated tumors other than hemangioblastomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i,j,k</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The hemangioblast cell has been identified as the embryologic progenitor cell for both endothelial cells and erythrocytes and proposed as the neoplastic progenitor cell in hemangioblastomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. These data demonstrate that VHL-associated neoplastic cells maintain the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells, giving direct rise to some tumor blood vessel development. This result should not be confused with recently demonstrated trans-differentiation in glioblastoma and the development of tumor-derived endothelial cells and perictyes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The intra- and extra-embryonic mesodermally derived hemangioblast is the origin of coupled vasculogenesis and primitive erythrocyte formation during embryogenesis within the yolk sac and dorsal root of the aorta respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Therefore, it is not difficult to conceive that tumors arising from the developmentally arrested hemangioblast are capable of endothelial differentiation.</p><p>Tumor progenitor hemangioblasts and RCC tumor cells, of which 90% of sporadic cases possess biallelic <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation, are unable to degrade HIF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Overexpression of HIF and downstream gene activation plays an important role in tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In line with previous reports, our findings indicate that the embryologically arrested pVHL-deficient hemangioblast is the neoplastic progenitor cell in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and that it also serves as the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors (RCC). Furthermore, based upon both previous and current data, we propose that pVHL-deficient tumor cells develop and progress secondary to constitutively produced proangiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and EDN1) that stimulate endothelial cell and erythrocyte differentiation, while also inducing angiogenesis within the existent tumor vascular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, <italic>de novo</italic> endothelial cells can combine with migrating endothelial cells recruited during angiogenesis during tumor blood vessel formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). However, at this time we cannot separate integrated tumor-derived endothelial cells from those derived during angiogenesis in terms of function. An in-depth understanding of vascular tumor biology in VHL-associated tumors will provide additional insight into cancer stem cell biology and tumor progression driven by unregulated HIF expression, as well as highlight the importance of developing novel treatment strategies capable of inhibiting vascular tissue proliferation. More specifically, therapies that exploit the known differentiation potential of the hemangioblast may offer an alternative treatment paradigm for CNS hemangioblastoma.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>VHL tumor samples</title><p>Tumor samples were collected at the Surgical Neurology Branch in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) under an instutition-approved protocol (NIH 03-N-164).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunohistochemistry staining</title><p>Tissues were fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Research Products International).
