In this study, we investigated whether the pseudoginsenoside F11 had protective effects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. To clarify it, one <italic>in vivo</italic> model of cisplatin-induced acute renal failure was performed. The results showed that pretreatment with F11 reduced cisplatin-elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, as well as ameliorated the histophathological damage. Further studies showed that F11 could suppress P53 activation, inverse the ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and the anti-oxidative and free radical levels induced by cisplatin, which in turn inhibited tubular cell apoptosis. Importantly, F11 enhanced rather than inhibited the anti-tumor activity of cispaltin in murine melanoma and Lewis lung cancer xenograft tumor models. Our findings suggested that administering F11 with cisplatin might alleviate the associated nephrotoxicity without compromising its therapeutic efficiency. This finding provides a novel potential strategy in the clinical treatment of cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cisplatin (CDDP) is a chemotherapeutic drug to be used in several standard regimens for a variety of malignant tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer, bladder, cervical, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Although CDDP has been a mainstay for chemotherapy, its usefulness is often restricted by the following side-effects, especially the dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, which negatively affects patients' quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Although the hydration therapy has been proved as an effective renal-protective strategy, a certain percentage of patients still suffers from CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Thus, new compounds, which could reduce this side effect while maintaining and/or enhancing its anti-tumor activity, would be of great clinical benefit.</p><p>Considerable research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms of nephrotoxicity induced by CDDP as well as on finding reasonable ways to prevent its development and progression. To date, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity remain unclear, although the oxidative stress had been recognized as one of the key factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. CDDP is freely filtered by the glomerulus and taken up by renal tubular cells, which might increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by disrupting the respiratory chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Given their broadly reactive nature, ROS could target and modify multiple cellular targets, such as lipids, proteins, and DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The resulting cellular stress could then induce cellular apoptosis by activating the p53 and/or initiating the mitochondrial cell death pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Several antioxidants and oxygen radical scavengers, such as cilastatin, edarabone and sildenafil, had been reported to protect against such damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Novel antioxidants might therefore be potential candidates for preventing and treating CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Ginseng (<italic>Panax ginseng</italic>) had been used medicinally for thousands of years in China, and was already shown to improve general and physical fatigue symptoms in cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. There were substantial evidences to show that ginseng had a wide range of pharmacological actions, including neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antioxidant and anticancer properties, in which the active ingredient were primarily thought to the ginsenosides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Recently, we reported that Rh2 and ocotillol, two ingredients in the gingeng, attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicology via their antioxidant capabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Here we reported that F11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, one pseudoginsenoside, attenuated the nephrotoxicity induced by CDDP without affecting its anti-tumor efficacy.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>F11 attenuated CDDP-induced renal injury</title><p>The biomarkers Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cre) were used to evaluate renal damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

Co-treatment with F11 at the dose of 10&#x02005;mg/kg did not attenuate, but rather seemed to augment the growth inhibiting properties of CDDP to a certain degree. No obvious anti-tumor effect of F11 alone was observed.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The defining limitation of CDDP-based chemotherapy was its associated nephrotoxicity, which was caused by oxidative stress and tubular cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Therefore, novel antioxidants and/or apoptosis inhibitors, that could protect the kidney from CDDP damage without compromising its anti-tumor activity, could be of great use in treating certain cancers. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the protective activity of the pseudoginsenoside F11against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity without affecting its anticancer properties.</p><p>There was strong evidence that CDDP-induced renal injury was caused by the accumulated exposure of the drug in the tubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, in which the glomerular filtration rate was reduced and followed by an increase of BUN and Cre levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Other labs had established well proven rat models, in which CDDP was administrated with a single intraperitoneally (i.p) injection at 5~10&#x02005;mg/kg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In the current study, such animals were given one dosage of CDDP (6&#x02005;mg/kg) and renal function parameters, such as BUN and Cre levels, as well as morphology characteristics, were observed. There were obvious pathological changes 5 days after injection, which were all attenuated by F11 co-treatment. Thus, F11 might be a potential protector against the renal damage induced by CDDP.</p><p>The toxic ROS induced by CDDP, which could cause oxidative stress damage, had been well documented to play an important role in the development of renal damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In agreement with the previous reports, CDDP administration in this study resulted in remarkable decrease in GSH-px and SOD, two important antioxidants in renal tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In addition, LPO, a common indicator of oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, was increased. F11, as one free radical scavenger, at a dose of 10&#x02005;mg/kg, could reverse, in part or completely, the deterioration of the unbalanced anti-oxidative and free radical. This finding was consistent with our previous reports that one derivation of F11 could restore the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and decrease the production of lipid peroxides in the mouse cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our findings were consistent with other reports, in which several anti-oxidants, such as cilastatin, edarabone and lycopene, also exerted protective activity against CDDP-induced renal damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>There was growing evidence that apoptosis played a predominant role in CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. The cellular damage caused by oxidative stress could activate the P53 and alter the physiological ratio of Bcl2 and Bax<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The activation of P53, as well as an unbalanced mitochondrial state, could activate caspase 3 and induce tubular cells undergoing apoptosis, which were easily detected by TUNEL staining. In this study, CDDP treatment did increase the protein levels of P53 and Bax, as well as decrease the Bcl2 expression. Thess effects were mitigated by co-treatment with F11 at a dosage of 10&#x02005;mg/kg. The number of TUNEL positive cells and the expression of apoptosis protein markers cl-caspase 3 and cl-caspase 9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), which indicated pretreatment with F11 decreased CDDP-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis.</p><p>The last and the most important question we addressed was whether F11 attenuated the anti-tumor activity of CDDP. To this end, two murine models were established and the tumor mass were used as an index of anti-tumor activity. The data showed that F11 did not inhibit the anti-tumor activity of CDDP, but actually enhanced its potency to a certain degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>p = 0.12</italic> and <italic>p = 0.57</italic> for B16 and Lewis lung cancer respectively, compared with that in CDDP group). The action of F11 on the toxicity of CDDP was distinct from its anti-tumor activity, although the exact mechanism of this was still unknown. One possible interpretation was that this occurred in a cell/tissue-dependence manner. Understanding the conditions surrounding this may further benefit its clinical use. This interesting finding, which has also been observed with several other compounds, such as cilastatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, carvedilol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and ginsenoside Rh2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, supported that further investigation into the role of F11 as a protector against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity was warranted.</p><p>In summary, this study provided first evidence that F11 was protective against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. It appears to support the maintenance of endogenous anti-oxidants levels and inhibit tubular cell apoptosis. Importantly, F11 did not reduce the anti-tumor activity of CDDP, and therefore might be a promising adjuvant therapy in cancer patients receiving with CDDP-based treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chemicals</title><p>F11 was isolated from <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> and had the molecular formula C<sub>42</sub>H<sub>72</sub>O<sub>14</sub> with MW 801.03.
