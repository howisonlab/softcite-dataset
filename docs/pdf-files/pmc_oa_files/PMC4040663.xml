Overexpression of patched 1 protein and Gli1 or constitutively active Indian Hedgehog (IHh)-parathyroid hormone-related protein signal pathway may lead to musculoskeletal tumorigenesis. However, for chondrosarcoma few studies have paid close attention to the IHh-Gli1 signal transduction cascade and more work needs to be carried out to fully elucidate Gli1 protein functions. Here we show that the IHh signal pathway was activated in chondrosarcoma, and knocking down the expression of Gli1 attenuated the disturbed IHh signal pathway, which not only suppressed cell proliferation and promoted G2/M cell cycle arrest but also enhanced cell apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression. Furthermore, Gli1 downregulation, not cyclopamine, induced autophagy by regulating mTOR phosphorylation, and inhibition of autophagy prevented Gli1 small interfering RNA-mediated cell death. We also demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity may mediate these antiproliferative events induced by Gli1 inhibition. These results indicate that Gli1 inhibition could ultimately provide a promising new approach for chondrosarcoma treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gli1</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ERK1/2</kwd><kwd>chondrosarcoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Chondrosarcoma is the second most frequently occurring primary bone cancer that develops in cartilage cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> At present, surgical resection remains the main form and the most successful means of treating chondrosarcomas, but it continues to have poor prognosis because there is very limited role for adjuvant treatments such as proton beam radiation and chemotherapy;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> in addition, it has been shown that, higher the grade of tumors, worse the prognosis for recurrence and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Therefore, there is an extremely urgent need to explore a novel remedy to combat the cancer.</p><p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway has a crucial role in regulating many developmental processes, such as pattern formation, differentiation, proliferation, death of cells and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Earlier studies on the Hh pathway mostly focused on embryonic development and neural tissue homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> There is growing recognition of the role of <italic>Hh</italic> genes in the formation of bone and cartilage, especially for the Indian Hedgehog (IHh), which is one of the key signaling molecules controlling both chondrocyte hypertrophy and bone formation in the developing skeletal system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> IHh is secreted by prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the normal growth plate of metazoans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> On one side, IHh ligands have been demonstrated to bind to patched 1 protein (PTCH1), causing internalization and degradation, thereby releasing SMO into the primary cilia where it promotes GLI protein dissociation through its inhibitory complex sufu/Gli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and then activates the glioma-associated (Gli) family of zinc finger transcription factors.

PTHrP signals through its receptor PTHR1 to inhibit chondrocyte hypertrophy and suppresses further IHh expression by keeping chondrocytes in a proliferating state; thus, it can be seen that IHh and PTHrP signaling forms a negative feedback loop that modulates the development of the normal growth plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> For chondrosarcoma, the IHh-PTHrP signal pathway is better understood and its function has been studied in great detail, but few studies have paid close attention to the IHh-glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) signal transduction cascade and more work needs to be carried out to fully elucidate Gli1 protein functions. Current strategies have been focusing on the development and use of small molecules to inhibit smoothened (Smo) (such as Cyclopamine, GDC-0449, LDE225, BMS-833923 (XL139), IPI-926, PF-04449913, LEQ506, and TAK-441).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> However, these strategies might not be applicable to the treatment of tumors that harbor molecular lesions downstream of Smo. In earlier studies, we have illustrated that constitutive activation of the Hh signaling pathway in chondrosarcoma is rarely caused by PTCH1 or SMO mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and therefore the aberrant activation of the pathway in chondrosarcoma is more likely due to downstream molecules, such as GLI proteins, which act as very important nuclear executors and mediate Hh signaling at the distal end of the pathway. On the basis of recent data on GLI transcription factors we have concluded that GLI1, and not GLI2 or Gli3, is the direct transcriptional Hh-target gene, which determines the cell's response to the Hh pathway activity and might be the causal agent in multiple cellular processes such as proliferation, cell cycle, and cell survival. In this paper, we investigated the effects of Gli1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) on human chondrosarcoma cell lines SW1353 and JJ012. Our results indicated that knockdown of Gli1 expression not only attenuated the affected Hh signal pathway but also suppressed cell growth and cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis as well as autophagy, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 activity may mediate these antiproliferative events induced by Gli1 inhibition. Thus, blocking the expression of Gli1 would be an ideal strategy for combating chondrosarcoma.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of IHh pathway members in the normal articular cartilage, in chondrosarcoma, and in their corresponding cell lines HC-a, SW1353, and JJ012</title><p>We first examined the expressions of key members in the IHh pathway using immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR and western blot analysis (WB) in 20 samples taken from the normal articular cartilage and chondrosarcoma tissues. qPCR data are not shown here because the CT values in articular cartilage samples were too high to obtain apart from IHh. IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) analyses showed that PTHrP, PTCH1, SMO, and Gli1 were all expressed in chondrosarcoma but not in the normal articular cartilage tissues. On the other hand, expression of IHh was detected in both tissues, but was significantly elevated in chondrosarcoma compared with the articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). As visualized by immunohistochemistry, Gli1 displayed an absolutely nuclear expression pattern, whereas others stained on cell membranes and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To further validate our results, we analyzed the expression of these genes in their corresponding cell lines HC-a, SW1353, and JJ012 by PCR and WB. Similar results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>). These findings indicate that there was an active IHh pathway in chondrosarcoma, which is essential for tumor growth, recurrence, metastasis, and cell survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability was reduced by Gli1 siRNA but not by the SMO inhibitor cyclopamine</title><p>As the IHh pathway is activated in chondrosarcoma, it was interesting to study whether inhibition of the pathway with a natural small-molecule cyclopamine, a specific SMO inhibitor, would kill SW1353 and JJ012 cells.

On the basis of the results, the activator of the pathway in chondrosarcoma might be located downstream of SMO, being a transcription factor such as GLI1. To test this hypothesis, we used siRNA to knock down Gli1 expression to see whether Gli1 was involved in the regulation of viability and proliferation in the chondrosarcoma cell lines. Our results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of Gli1 in SW1353 and JJ012 cells were reduced significantly 24, 48, and 72&#x02009;h after siGli1 transfection; data collected 48&#x02009;h after the knockdown treatment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>. The cell viabilities assayed by MTS showed constant decline with increase in time after the Gli1 siRNA transfection and were only about 30&#x02013;55&#x00025; of the values before the transfection in JJ012 and SW1352, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The active IHh signal pathway can be attenuated by siGli1 but not by cyclopamine</title><p>To further verify the findings, we assessed the net effect of siGli1 or cyclopamine on the expression of the key members in the pathway.

PCNA functions in cell cycle progression and serves as an attractive assay of cell proliferation;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that is expressed in proliferating cells and may be required for maintaining cell proliferation.

These data supported our <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence pointing to the critical role of Gli1 in the G2/M mitotic/transition phase.</p><p>To understand the mechanism of apoptosis exerted by siGli1, we studied the effect of siGli1 on the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and caspase3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there were significant inhibitions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression after treatment with siGli1 for 48&#x02009;h, but no obvious changes in the expression of Bax. In addition, cleavage of caspase3, which requires proteolytic processing of its inactive zymogen into activated p17 and p12 fragments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> had not been detected during the execution of the apoptotic cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations suggest that the Bcl-2 family of proteins, but not caspase3, controls apoptotic programmed cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Gli1 downregulation, not cyclopamine, induced autophagy by regulating mTOR phosphorylation</title><p>Autophagy-associated cell death is another type of programmed cell death after the discovery of apoptosis and necrosis by maintaining an important homeostatic mechanism that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and organelles and recycles cytoplasmic contents through a process by which these components are engulfed in autophagosomes and then digested via the lysosomal pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Induction of autophagy might be a novel approach for anticancer therapy. To investigate whether Gli1 is involved in autophagy, transmission electron microscopy was performed to examine the ultrastructures of autophagy. Representative images depicting the ultrastructures of autophagy, such as autophagosome-like vacuoles with double-membrane structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and b</xref> black arrow) and segments of the double-membrane formed between a vacuole and mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and c</xref> white arrow), are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>. Expression of LC3-II visualized by immunofluorescence is recognized as a means to track changes in autophagosome formation in living cells. LC3 is processed from LC3-I to LC3-II during autophagy. LC3-II is inserted into newly formed autophagosome membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Therefore, we investigated the impact of Gli1 expression on LC3-II production. Our results show that silencing Gli1 with siRNAs increased the LC3-II localization in the cytoplasm in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) and resulted in the accumulation of LC3-II and degradation of P62 (a known autophagy substrate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). In contrast, no such effect was detected in cyclopamine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the contribution of Gli1 to autophagy regulation, we studied the relationship between Gli1 and mTOR. We observed that silenced expression of Gli1 decreased mTOR phosphorylation, but rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy through mechanisms involving mTOR kinase inactivation, had no effect on Gli1. We also analyzed the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a marker of mTOR activity, and found that it followed the same trend as mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Densitometry was performed for quantification, and the ratios of P-mTOR and P- p70S6K to <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-actin are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>. These outcomes elicited downregulated expression of Gli1-induced autophagy depending on mTOR dephosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Autophagy inhibition prevented siGli1-mediated cell death</title><p>Autophagy has been associated with both cell death and survival depending on the cellular context and stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Given that autophagy can be induced by siGli1, we evaluated whether autophagy induced by Gli1 inhibition had a role in cell death. A link between autophagy and cell death has been demonstrated using pharmacological (e.g., 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), chloroquine (CQ), bafilomycin A1, or monensin) and genetic (silencing of Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, Atg10, or Atg12) approaches for suppression of autophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> 3-MA can block the induction of LC3-II puncta formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> CQ is a lysosomotropic agent that has been suggested to inhibit autophagy by perturbing lysosomal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Cells treated with siGli1 in the presence of 3-MA (2.5&#x02009;mM) and CQ (30&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml) demonstrated that 3-MA and CQ significantly enhanced the viability of cells in response to Gli1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). To further test this possibility, we invalidated the expression of autophagic genes Atg7 and Beclin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and quantified the production of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Similarly, RNA interference (RNAi) directed against the autophagy genes atg7 and beclin1 blocked cell death in chondrosarcoma cells transfected with siGli1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). These results support the possibility that autophagy inhibition prevented siGli1-mediated cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>ERK1/2 activity mediated antiproliferative events</title><p>The ERK signaling pathway has a crucial role in almost all cell functions and therefore requires exquisite control of its spatiotemporal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> On treatment of Gli1 siRNA-transfected cells with the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 (10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M; U0126 is not toxic up to 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M in SW1353 and JJ012 cells) we found that U0126 improved the cell vitality that had been reduced by Gli1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), resulting in the release of most cells from arrest at the G2/M stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) and also strongly reduced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) in Gli1 siRNA-transfected chondrosarcoma cells. In addition, U0126 also significantly reduced LC3-II puncta formation, which implied that Gli1 inhibition-induced autophagy was attenuated in U0126 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>), and the MEK/ERK-related signaling pathway contributed to autophagy in the chondrosarcoma cell lines. To further determine whether the involvement of MEK/ERK signaling is a direct or indirect consequence of depressed Gli1 activity, we treated the cells with siGli1 and U0126 for 24&#x02009;h and found that reduction in Gli1 expression promoted ERK phosphorylation but had no impact on MEK1/2 and that U0126 inhibited both activated and inactivated MEK1/2 as well as activated ERK1/2 pathways, leading to the repression of GLI1. Taken together, the current data showing that depressed Gli1 activity promoted ERK activity and that Gli1 activity was also dependent on MEK/ERK signaling highlight the possible presence of a novel feedback mechanism that modulates GLI1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Many studies associate the MEK/ERK signal pathway's oncogenic potential to increased cell survival. Paradoxically, depending on the cell type and stimulus, ERK activity has been shown to mediate different antiproliferative events such as apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, we hold the opinion that phosphorylation-ERK contributed to the cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy induced by Gli1 inhibition in chondrosarcoma cell lines.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>According to our studies, we find that the IHh signal pathway is disturbed in chondrosarcoma.

This was probably due to insufficient Gli1 protein translocation into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of the Hh pathway genes, such as <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>PTCH1</italic>, as well as many survival-promoting molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In the present study, SMO levels appeared to be insufficient for stimulating the pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> so did chondrosarcoma in our study, but the expression of SMO was downregulated by siGli1. Thus, the whole Hh signal transduction cascade was weakened and corrected by knockdown of Gli1 expression. We also confirmed that siGli1 decreased the proliferation rate as well as PCNA and Ki-67 expression, which has already been abundantly implicated in other cancers, such as in BCCs and meduloblastomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Recent work has provided insight into the fact that Hh influences the expression and activity of core cell cycle components at multiple points within the cell cycle in a variety of circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Intriguingly, we found that siGli1 induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest by downregulating cyclinB and Rb phosphorylation, thereby rendering chondrosarcoma cells quiescent and prohibiting tumor progression.

The mechanism by which Gli1 regulates autophagy is still unclear and the role of autophagy in cell growth and cell death in chondrosarcoma is still being debated considerably. In our study, it was found, for the first time to our knowledge, that Gli1 inhibition, not cyclopamine, induced synthesis of autophagosome in chondrosarcoma. Autophagy has been implicated in maintaining cancer cell survival, but its precise role is ambiguous. Autophagy also functions as a mechanism of pro-cell death, depending on the cellular context that when unrestrained can result in progressive consumption of cellular components and subsequent cell death and might mediate resistance to anticancer therapies such as radiation, chemotherapy, and some targeted therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> In addition, autophagy inhibition prevented siGli1-mediated cell death. It strengthened our point of view that induction of autophagic cell death is a useful alternative approach to killing tumor cells. Induction of autophagy is a possible antitumor mechanism of action of allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1. One such rapalog, rapamycin, is used as an antirejection drug in organ transplant recipients and has demonstrated anticancer activity in myxoid chondrosarcoma as well.<sup>48</sup> Recent studies have shown that activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> but our study hold the opposite view that Gli1 transcription factor appears to be no changes treated with rapamycin, whereas silenced the expression of Gli1 with siRNAs lead to mTOR dephosphorylation then induced autophagy-associated cell death suggested that Gli1 may be located at the upstream of mTOR in chondrosarcoma cells. Consequently, when treating resistant tumors such as recurrent chondrosarcoma, antineoplastics leading to autophagy-associated cell death might prove to be a unique form of combinational therapy rather than a novel target for anticancer therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup></p><p>In the investigations on the mechanism of these antiproliferative events induced by Gli1 inhibition, it has been shown that constitutive activation of ERK by active Raf,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> cadmium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> or IGF-I receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> induces a form of cell death that is correlated with extensive cell rounding and with the formation of cytoplasmic macrovacuoles, which pushes the nucleus and the cytoplasm to the side of the quiescent and dying cell. We also found that there is a crosstalk between the Hh and the MEK/ERK signal pathway and that ERK1/2 activity mediates these antiproliferative events. On the basis of these findings, we propose a tentative regulatory mechansim of IHh and Gli1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the study we had examined is limited to <italic>in vitro</italic> cell lines, and a significant number of challenges still need to be overcome for a successful <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Although there are animal studies that do support the possibility of an RNAi mechanism of action from administered siRNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, using naked siRNA or siRNA by liposomal delivery, suggested non-RNAi mechanisms of action for chondrosarcoma suppression. Therefore, we are trying to find a new delivery system that can provide effective delivery of functional siRNA to animals with chondrosarcoma.</p><p>In conclusion, knockdown of IHh-Gli1 signaling by Gli1-specific siRNAs not only attenuated the disturbed IHh signal pathway but also curbed the growth and survival of the treated chondrosarcoma cells. The related mechanisms were also systematically demonstrated in this paper. This will not only advance our understanding of chondrosarcoma development at the molecular level but also lead to an important new opportunity in which therapeutic effects might be achieved by Gli1 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Human articular cartilage and chondrosarcoma specimens, cell lines, and reagents</title><p>The fresh human normal articular cartilage and chondrosarcoma specimen were obtained under the approved protocols of the Institutional Ethics Review Boards of Peking University People's Hospital.
