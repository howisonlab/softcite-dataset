Despite a growing interest in this topic, most studies since 2007 have reviewed CBT applications for other sleep disorders. Currently, 6 reviews have been published on narcolepsy, with an expert consensus being reached that CBT represented an important adjunctive treatment for the disease. The current paper reviews the need for CBT applications for narcolepsy by generalizing the application of multicomponent treatments and performing studies that extrapolate the results obtained from multicenter studies. Nineteen studies were found in which the need-for-treatment guidelines identified the use of CBT for narcolepsy. Three additional studies were identified that evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral measures and multicomponent treatments for which treatment protocols have been proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cognitive behavioral treatment</kwd><kwd>Narcolepsy</kwd><kwd>Behavior modification</kwd><kwd>Clinical formulation</kwd><kwd>Non-pharmacological treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder that significantly affects overall patient functioning. One study reported that this disease affects 1 in 2000 individuals <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Narcolepsy consists of a set of core symptoms known by many authors as &#x0201c;narcoleptic tetrad&#x0201d;. These symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; i.e., sudden sleep attacks during the day), cataplexy (i.e., the loss of muscle tone during intense emotions), sleep paralysis (i.e., feeling unable to move when waking up), hypnagogic hallucinations (i.e., active hallucinations prior to the onset of sleep), and dream pattern alterations <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> as well as secondary symptoms that accompany the disorder, such as automatic behaviors and cognitive deficits <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[3&#x02013;6]</xref>.</p><p>Different consequences of narcolepsy have been described <xref rid="bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>. Because this disease is chronic, patients and their families have trouble coping with it. Furthermore, narcolepsy is associated with an increased risk of work-related and transit accidents <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, sexual dysfunctions <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, neuropsychological alterations <xref rid="bib9 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[9,11,12]</xref> (increased reaction time, decreased executive functioning), and an overall significant reduction in quality of life <xref rid="bib10 bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[10,13&#x02013;15]</xref>.</p><p>The treatment of choice for narcolepsy consists of prescribing stimulants to control EDS and antidepressants to treat parasomnias and associated cataplexy. Drug therapy has been highly recommended and supported by well-designed research that shows its effectiveness.</p><p>Conversely, the implementation of CBT (i.e., the systematic application of the principles and learning techniques needed to evaluate and improve behavior) has not been well studied with regard to narcolepsy, most likely because<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0610"><label>(a)</label><p>the studies performed have specific methodological weaknesses or are case reports;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0615"><label>(b)</label><p>the low prevalence of narcolepsy draws little attention from psychologists; and</p></list-item><list-item id="u0620"><label>(c)</label><p>psychologists have limited interest in working with patients who have diseases that &#x0201c;are the exclusive domain of medical doctors&#x0201d;.</p></list-item></list></p><p>As <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows, however, 32.4% of psychologists who are trained in CBT are interested in applying it to cases of narcolepsy (American Association of Sleep Medicine AASM, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). This figure is similar to the interest in the use of CBT for other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing and circadian rhythm disorders), and is surpassed only by insomnia.</p><p>In another important sense, the control of hypersomnia through behavioral interventions was included in the conference organized by the American Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine. Thus, a growing interest exists in developing comprehensive and effective treatments for narcolepsy.</p><p>The primary aim of this review is to describe the background regarding the use of CBT for patients with narcolepsy. It also seeks to advance specific proposals and questions, putting forward an agenda concerning where research on this subject should be directed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><p>A search was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Springer databases as well as conference proceedings and relevant journals. Several key sources of non-indexed literature were also searched.</p><p>The papers cited in the reference lists of previous reviews on this topic were also examined. CBT and narcolepsy were used as keywords. When necessary, certain authors and associations were contacted for additional published and unpublished materials. In all, 30 papers were collected, with an additional 7 which were discarded because they were not related to CBT.</p><p>The remaining papers were classified based on the type of study and behavioral measures used as well as the sample, method, and results.</p><p>An assessment of the level of evidence was not included because some studies were not adequate. Thus, descriptions of the studies and the relevant conclusions with regard to their quality, conclusions, and contributions were preferred.</p><p>The analysis did not examine a study design effect because of the disparity between the measures and methods used across the papers included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s0020"><label>3.1</label><title>Explanatory psychological models of narcolepsy</title><p>During this review, two theoretical psychological models were identified that provide the rationale for CBT&#x02019;s use for narcolepsy.</p><p>The cognitive-behavioral model of narcolepsy first identifies the basic elements which make up the clinical syndrome, and then describes the causal factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) that either precede or modify the production of symptoms <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>This model provides the basis for designing a structured intervention program by identifying the interaction between external risk factors (i.e., those associated with disease symptoms that might be precipitants and triggers) and internal risk factors (i.e., predictors of narcolepsy such as biological factors, orexinergic neuron deficits, and so on). The model presumes that the internal factors (i.e., predisposing factors) are constant while it is the external risk factors which chronically maintain the illness.</p><p>Cognitive factors are also taken into account. The model notes that while some individuals may manifest symptoms under specific circumstances, others might be asymptomatic in the presence of the same stimuli. It attributes these response differences to the unique individual learning histories whereby some patients are able control their cataleptic symptoms because they have learned to regulate their emotions. Thus, while recognizing the important contribution of precipitating factors (e.g., conditions that trigger cataplexy, passive situations, sleepiness, sleep deprivation, and so on) to the overall illness, the model also permits the possibility of symptom modification through learning.</p><p>The second model <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> attempts to explain the relationship between REM sleep disorders and cataplexy. This model assumes that REM sleep is an anti-stress filter that is affected by narcolepsy, such that it does not fully filter the activating information of these processes, which thereby increase as a result of the occurrence of high emotional arousal that cannot be processed. As an incomplete survival process, the body acts in the same way during sleep (but not in a waking state) to counteract the anti-stress production deficit that generates cataplexy during an emotional event.</p><p>In this model of narcolepsy, afferent sensations of the patient&#x005f3;s emotional state cause catalepsy, similar to what would happen in extreme situations (e.g., similarly to paralysis resulting from intense fear, patients with narcolepsy want to move but cannot). Patients with narcolepsy cannot perform movements after the initial paralysis. This suggests that a type of neuronal interference may be present, in which prior programming blocks later processing; this in turn inhibits or prevents motor movements.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>3.2</label><title>Consensus, expert reviews, and clinical evidence</title><p>The literature reports that stimulants are the treatment of choice for narcolepsy; however, the clinical guidelines of several countries recommend the use of cognitive and behavioral measures as adjunctive therapies to lessen the effect of overall patient dysfunction and obtain the best response with the lowest possible prescription dosage.</p><sec id="s0030"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Consensus in Latin America</title><p>No formal consensus exists in Latin America concerning approaches to narcolepsy compared with Europe and the United States. Only the Brazilian Society of Sleep Medicine has provided an official set of guidelines on this subject (in 2009 and 2010) <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>.</p><p>These guidelines recommend that clinicians obtain 4 and 5 types of evidence (e.g., non-randomized controlled trials, retrospective case reports, clinical case studies, or expert consensus) prior to rendering a diagnosis or initiating therapy. Therapeutic strategies emphasize behavioral interventions such as CBT sleep hygiene recommendations (based on the literature and clinical experience of a specialist committee and approved by majority vote) Additionally, it is recommended that clinicians prescribe a regimen of patient naps, employ psychosocial measures (e.g., adapt work shifts based on specific patient needs), and administer psychological support therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Consensus in Europe</title><p>Two consensuses were found in Europe. The following measures are recommended in the United Kingdom <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>: education regarding the disease (grade C, level IV), scheduled naps (grade B, level IIb), nocturnal sleep duration (grade C, level IV), support in planning work (grade C, level IV), and psychosocial support (grade C, level IV).</p><p>In most cases, the &#x0201c;levels of evidence&#x0201d; refer to expert-obtained consensus (except with regard to naps); levels III and IV refer to evidence obtained from non-experimental studies (except IIb, which refers to quasi-experimental studies).</p><p>The second consensus <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, reached by the European Association of Neurology in 2006, presents a symptomatological approach that cites behavioral measures to manage narcolepsy in the same manner.</p><p>This consensus considers the role of naps with levels of evidence II and III and recommendation grade B. With regard to cataplexy, the aim is to avoid precipitating factors and increase social contact (but without grades of recommendation). These measures and other psychological interventions were not reviewed nor recommended, because they lacked support from well-controlled studies, although they were used for other symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Consensus in North America</title><p>The 2007 consensus and review of the general management of narcolepsy by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> considered only one study with evidence level II behavioral measures.</p><p>This consensus did not describe behavioral measures for other symptoms. Importantly, however, they highlighted the need for more evidence-based studies to improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy who are undergoing drug treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>3.3</label><title>Narcolepsy reviews</title><p>In addition to the foregoing consensus statement, six reviews of behavioral treatments for narcolepsy were found.</p><p>The first review <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> described non-pharmacologic interventions, such as behavior modification (e.g., planning structured sleep schedules, naps, dietary measures, and support with regard to issues related to mental and physical health to address social factors).</p><p>Another study surveyed practitioners and found that 63.2% used behavioral to reduce cataplexy, 54.5% did so for sleep attacks, and 35.5% did so for EDS <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The management in the survey of specific coping strategies was included, which augmented the behavioral measures as measured by reductions in drug treatments.</p><p>The third review was published in 2003 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This paper stressed the importance of sleep hygiene, scheduled naps, and their use in combination with pharmacological strategies. Moreover, dietary recommendations and other psychological techniques, such as hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation, were included. In addition, this review was the first to report effects similar in size to meta-analyses in two studies conducted with regard to scheduled naps, where the effects were 0.15 for short naps, 0.43 for 15&#x000a0;min, and 0.7 for long naps. These results indicate that long naps had a greater effect on the control group in studies that used this measure for naps.</p><p>The fourth review <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> addressed the behavioral management of narcolepsy, making recommendations for the symptomatic treatment of nocturnal and daytime symptoms. This review regarded behavioral management of narcolepsy as being important for different reasons. First, although symptoms are usually well controlled with medications, which causes severe psychosocial distress, EDS remains present in most cases. Second, behavioral measures should assist the patient in gaining some control of the disease to reduce its effect on quality of life.</p><p>This review classified measures as either nocturnal or diurnal and investigated the studies that addressed each type.</p><p>Finally, the fifth review <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> argued that the central goal of behavioral measures must point to the involvement of many psychosocial problems commonly experienced by patients with narcolepsy. The review recognized that a shortage of controlled studies existed which focused on examining to examine the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic measures. Furthermore, it suggested that despite this deficiency, the use of these therapies was increasing, with approximately 15% of UK physicians reporting that they had used them, either as an adjuvant or a first-choice treatment, and further reporting specific benefits following their use.</p><p>Overall, the reviews recognized that a number of behavioral therapies were being increasingly used, and were coming to be regarded as key adjunctive elements in comprehensive treatment programs for narcolepsy (See <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>3.4</label><title>Studies reviewed</title><p>Analyses were performed on the studies found in the databases and strategies were reviewed regarding the use of behavioral techniques to address narcolepsy. The following 19 behavioral studies were found (see <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Seven behavioral intervention techniques were identified within the above 19 studies. These methods converge with regard to the study quality but not quantity of the five tests listed in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The first technique described is sleep satiation, which consists of the scheduled extension of nocturnal sleep and increasing equilibrium during the day. This technique, which is based on the theory of sleep homeostasis, is effective for certain patients when combined with other measures.</p><p>Importantly, the studies reviewed differ with regard to the benefits provided to patients with narcolepsy because improvement is typically found with regard to alertness during the day but not the quantity and quality of sleep.</p><p>Short naps benefited certain patients, whereas long naps resulted in increased nocturnal sleep in others. Overall, a clear consensus exists with regard to scheduling 15-min naps in the afternoon depending on the difficulty and level of disruption that patients experience.</p><p>This nap schedule has also led to a considerable decrease in the consumption of drugs among patients with narcolepsy <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In three of the cases reported, hypnosis showed some level of effectiveness; however, the description of the protocols used in each study differed. A clear hypnosis protocol has not been established to address narcolepsy. Furthermore, control studies are lacking that discriminate whether it is hypnosis itself or the sleep induced by hypnosis that improves patient functioning.</p><p>In addition, lucid dreaming decreased episodes of hypnagogic hallucinations; however, this technique should be used with caution because of the sleep fragmentation caused by training in this technique.</p><p>The studies using cognitive behavioral techniques showed that education about the disease and psychosocial support were associated with increased adherence to drug treatment and improved patient quality of life.</p><p>The progressive muscle relaxation and additional measures used in one case report were useful in addressing an acute problem, but this study did not yield significant information regarding the duration of the effect of these techniques. Thus, a larger controlled study should be performed to test their effectiveness.</p><p>Finally, healthy eating is important, but more studies are needed to empirically support its effectiveness. Overall, studies have addressed the symptoms of narcolepsy, but they are not designed to extrapolate their results to the patient&#x005f3;s daily life and are limited in use. However, naps are useful.</p><p>The behavioral measures reported here are not meant for a multi-component or systematic approach. Furthermore, they lack cognitive-behavioral theoretical foundations; for this reason, it is understandable that they have not been considered the treatments of choice in consensus agreements, although experts continue to have positive expectations regarding these method as a result of their experience and intuition.</p><p>Against this background, the question becomes, &#x0201c;Where should the aims of psychological interventions for narcolepsy be directed?&#x0201d;</p><p>In contrast to CBT for insomnia and the growing interest in the application of CBT for sleep-disordered breathing (as in the case of narcolepsy), few advances have been made. In a recent review Conroy et al. [51] summarized a number of studies that had used non-pharmacological therapies for managing hypersomnia. Although not focused specifically on narcolepsy, the review described the functional aspects of the techniques used for EDS intervention. Among the referenced therapies were general sleep hygiene techniques, physical exercise, distraction techniques, and naps; information was gathered from a previous consensus. Also included were specific cognitive-behavioral measures such as behavioral analysis, behavior experiments, motivational therapy, and psychoeducation. In these studies, however, the levels of evidence to help understand this problem were not reported.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>3.5</label><title>What is necessary to know regarding cognitive behavioral therapy for narcolepsy (CBT-N)?</title><p>The studies that have been reported thus far have used a variety of techniques and programs to treat other sleep and mood disorders with physiological etiologies. An appropriate clinical formulation should be established initially to serve as a starting point for preparing formal (multi-component) protocols because of the multi-symptomatic manifestation of narcolepsy and the multiple effects on patient quality of life.</p><p>From this point of view, (a) CBT for narcolepsy (CBT-N) should start from a clinical formulation based on symptoms and their effects on social life; (b) the intervention process should be contextualized according to the patient and not preclude a systematic follow-up; and (c) CBT should have elements common to any psychological treatment.</p><sec id="s0060"><label>3.5.1</label><title>Characteristics of CBT-N</title><p>Based on previous findings, it is proposed that CBT for narcolepsy should have three components.<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0625"><label>(a)</label><p>The behavioral component begins with specific techniques aimed at changing sleep-disordered behaviors or sleep-related disorder variables that are not compatible (e.g., sleep satiation and nap training).</p></list-item><list-item id="u0630"><label>(b)</label><p>The cognitive component is aimed at modifying beliefs, motivations, and emotions that might play an important role in maintaining narcolepsy (thereby increasing the frequency of symptoms) and emphasizing the psychosocial effect of the disorder.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0635"><label>(c)</label><p>The educational component seeks to instruct the patient regarding the nature of the disease, the mechanism of drug action, and precautions regarding the use of medication to achieve an overall understanding of the problem.

For example, systematic desensitization is used to address cataplexy. The main characteristic of this cognitive-behavioral technique is the successive approximation of situations that increase the frequency and intensity of dysfunctional behaviors, emotions, or cognitions. Given the characteristics of cataplexy, CBT becomes a starting point for patients with narcolepsy to cope with emotions.</p><p>Another technique for potential use in CBT with regard to cataplexy is stimulus satiation; this procedure uses the reinforcer that maintains cataplectic behavior continuously until its effect is lost.</p><p>Another technique is sleep satiation. As described in previous reviews, the frequency of the behavior (i.e., daytime sleep attacks) is detected to determine the degree of sleepiness, and a sleep diary is used to determine the number of sessions. Afterwards, continuous one-day sleep episodes are scheduled without light-dark cues. This behavioral disposition (in addition to sleep regulation) explains the effectiveness of naps and scheduled nocturnal sleep extension.</p><p>Imagery rehearsal therapy is used effectively for nightmares and might be used among patients with narcolepsy to control sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the major cognitive behavioral intervention techniques in narcolepsy based on the findings of this review.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>3.5.3</label><title>Structure of therapy sessions</title><p>Although all recommendations are aimed at addressing the symptoms of narcolepsy, this perspective proposes dealing with both symptomatic factors and their effect on patient quality of life. The following recommendations are suggested for handling sessions (see <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Given the technical provisions in the field of group therapy, this protocol can be applied as a group. Importantly, this procedure is not a prescription and can have particularities; nevertheless, it organizes the multicomponent elements of the CBT approach to narcolepsy. It is important to establish which techniques can be used through a process of clinical formulation and apply those best suited to the problematic context of the patient <xref rid="bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[48,49]</xref>. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows a flow chart as an example of the use of these techniques to treat narcolepsy and other sleep disorders (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3.6</label><title>Effectiveness of multicomponent treatments</title><p>Since 2011, several studies have describes the effectiveness of CBT for narcolepsy. The first randomized study <xref rid="bib50 bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr">[50&#x02013;52]</xref> compared results with a control group after six months and one year of treatment; self-report measures (i.e., the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Scale Ullanlina Narcolepsy, SF 36, and MSLT) were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent (sleep satiation, nap training, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving techniques) treatment. Significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) between the two groups were found. Specifically, the treatment group demonstrated a significant improvement with regard to quality of life (physical function, social function, vitality and emotional role) and significant improvements were observed in subjective and objective reports of EDS (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.005).</p><p>A second study <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> compared decreased sleepiness and cataplexy with nap training and systematic desensitization.

These findings should be a starting point for research and a validation process of the intervention model proposed in multicenter studies to develop related research regarding CBT for narcolepsy.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In clinical settings, several factors make non-pharmacological treatments indispensable for narcolepsy.</p><p>First stimulants (amphetamines) are the drugs of choice to control sleepiness, and are primarily used for their stimulating effect. Although they effectively control EDS, their high risk for addiction, which is related to the phenomena of tolerance, abuse, and abstinence should be mentioned. In the context of narcolepsy, it is common for patients not receiving a follow-up assessment to alter their daily consumed dose, especially in the case of methylphenidate.</p><p>This drug results in increased side effects (e.g., headache, tremor, palpitations, and anxiety) that hinder adherence to treatment and reduce patient quality of life. However, the use of amphetamine derivatives is contraindicated among patients with comorbidities such as systemic arterial hypertension or acquired diabetes mellitus. Thus, patients with comorbid narcolepsy are suitable candidates for CBT-N.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>5</label><title>Potential Competing Interest / Disclosure Statement</title><p>The authors have read the journal&#x02019;s policy and have the following potential conflicts: All authors declare that they have no proprietary, financial, professional, nor any other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product or services and/or company that could be construed or considered to be a potential conflict of interest that might have influenced the views expressed in this manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ohayon</surname><given-names>M.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>From wakefulness to excessive sleepiness: what we know and still need to know</article-title><source>Sleep Med Rev</source><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><year>2008</year><fpage>129</fpage><lpage>141</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18342261</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jim&#x000e9;nez-Correa</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name><name><surname>Haro</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonz&#x000e1;lez</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vel&#x000e1;zquez-Moctezuma</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Correlations between subjective and objective features of nocturnal sleep and excessive diurnal sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy</article-title><source>Arq Neuropsiquiatr</source><volume>67</volume><issue>4</issue><year>2009</year><fpage>995</fpage><lpage>1000</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20069207</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="othref0005">Schenck CH, Bassetti CL, Arnulf I, Emmanuel Mignot E.
