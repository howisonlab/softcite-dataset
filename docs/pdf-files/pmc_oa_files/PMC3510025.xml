We show here that a constitutively activated RhoD generated two types of actin-containing thin peripheral cellular protrusions distinct from Cdc42-induced filopodia. One was longer, almost straight, immotile, and sensitive to fixation, whereas the other was shorter, undulating, motile, and resistant to fixation. Moreover, cells expressing wild-type RhoD extended protrusions toward fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2/4/8&#x02013;coated beads. Stimulation of wild-type RhoD-expressing cells with these FGFs also caused formation of cellular protrusions. Nodules moved through the RhoD-induced longer protrusions, mainly toward the cell body. Exogenously expressed FGF receptor was associated with these moving nodules containing endosome-like vesicles. These results suggest that the protrusions are responsible for intercellular communication mediated by FGF and its receptor. Accordingly, the protrusions are morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes. RhoD was activated by FGF2/4/8. Knockdown of RhoD interfered with FGF-induced protrusion formation. Activated RhoD specifically bound to mDia3C and facilitated actin polymerization together with mDia3C. mDia3C was localized to the tips or stems of the protrusions. In addition, constitutively activated mDia3C formed protrusions without RhoD or FGF stimulation. Knockdown of mDia3 obstructed RhoD-induced protrusion formation. These results imply that RhoD activated by FGF signaling forms cytoneme-like protrusions through activation of mDia3C, which induces actin filament formation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diverse types of cell protrusions play roles in a variety of cellular functions, including cell migration, cell differentiation, and intercellular communication. Among these protrusions, filopodia and lamellipodia have been extensively and intensively studied. In consequence, molecular mechanisms of their generation and their structures and functions are relatively well clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Small <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Faix <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Mellor, 2010</xref>). Actin filament formation is responsible for generation of these protrusions. Filopodia contain tight parallel bundles of actin filaments, whereas lamellipodia are filled with branched or cross-linked actin filaments. Filopodia serve as sensory antennae or tentacles to probe microenvironment of cells, although their roles are diverse and not fully understood. On the other hand, lamellipodia are essential for cell migration by crawling. Both of these protrusions adhere to the substratum through integrin-based focal complexes or nascent focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Geiger <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cytonemes are actin-based, thin, long cell protrusions first reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disk cells and mouse embryo limb bud cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ram&#x000ed;rez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>), although cytonemes of limb bud cells have been inadequately characterized. Wing or eye imaginal disk cells and tracheal cells extend cytonemes toward signaling center cells in the organizers, producing specific morphogen or growth factor signaling proteins, such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Spitz/epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Branchless (Bnl)/fibroblast growth factor (FGF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hsiung <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Roy <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Nodules or punctae containing the receptors of each morphogen/growth factor are specifically segregated in cytonemes and move through cytonemes toward the cell body. Accordingly, cytonemes are proposed to be involved in long-distance intercellular communication by directly transferring specific morphogens/growth factors with their receptors. Similar protrusions have been reported in a variety of cell types, including human neutrophils, mouse B lymphocytes, and mast cells treated in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Galkina <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gupta and DeFranco, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fifadara <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, viral cytonemes, which extend from uninfected target cells to an infected cell by the interaction between viral envelope glycoprotein with the receptor, transmit retroviruses from infected to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Sherer <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The Rho family of small GTPases participate in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia by regulating actin filament formation. Cdc42 binds to activate neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) together with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or Src homology 3 (SH3) domain&#x02013;containing proteins. Activated N-WASP induces Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;mediated, branched actin filament formation (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). Cdc42 also binds and activates mDia2, which nucleates and elongates unbranched actin filaments. A current working model hypothesizes that a subset of uncapped actin filaments of the Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;nucleated dendritic networks is targeted for continued actin filament elongation by mDia2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Yang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Faix <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Mellor, 2010</xref>). mDia2 also nucleates to form new unbranched actin filaments. The barbed ends of these elongating actin filaments are converged through the motor activity of myosin-X, leading to the formation of filopodia. The actin filaments are cross-linked to become stiff bundles by fascin in the shaft of filopodia. RhoQ (TC10) and RhoJ (RhoT or TCL), both of which are phylogenetically close to Cdc42, also activate N-WASP and form longer filopodial protrusions than does Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abe <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), although involvement of mDia proteins in actin filament formation for the protrusion formation is unclear.</p><p>In contrast, the mechanisms of cytoneme formation remain poorly understood. It is unclear whether any Rho family proteins, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, mDia proteins, other actin nucleation factors, or elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dominguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chesarone <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Takano <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) are involved in actin filament formation giving rise to cytonemes. RhoD induces alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and reduces their movement through activating hDia2C (corresponding to mDia3C) and Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Murphy <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Gasman <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It also regulates the actin cytoskeleton to disassemble actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by antagonizing RhoA, resulting in suppression of cell migration and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Tsubakimoto <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, overexpressed, constitutively activated RhoD forms actin-containing thin cell protrusions reaching 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m in length, with some being attached to the substratum but others being motile due to a lack focal adhesion&#x02013;associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Murphy <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Fluorescently labeled transferrin is internalized through these protrusions and colocalized with RhoD.</p><p>Thus we addressed the question of whether the protrusions induced by RhoD correspond to cytonemes and investigated the mechanisms of actin filament formation by RhoD. The morphological and functional properties of RhoD-induced protrusions in cultured mesenchymal cells were equivalent to those of cytonemes. RhoD was activated by FGF signaling, and RhoD-activated mDia3C was responsible for the actin filament formation in the protrusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>RhoD forms two types of actin-based thin protrusions</title><p>To assess properties of cell protrusions induced by the constitutively active RhoD(G26V) (Gly26 is converted to Val) in comparison with those by Cdc42(G12V), we transfected mouse mesenchymal C3H/10T1/2 (10T1/2) cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein (<italic>EGFP</italic>)-fused cDNAs encoding each protein. Cdc42(G12V)-formed filopodia were usually &#x0003c;10 &#x003bc;m in length, thicker, and straight and contained actin filament bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1A).

Time-lapse microscopy showed that the former protrusions moved flexibly and dynamically but that the latter were immotile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplemental Movie S1). The latter contained fluorescent nodules or punctae. Although the nodules moved in both anterograde and retrograde directions, most of them eventually moved toward the cell body (Movies S1 and S2). The velocity of movement of the nodules varied, and each nodule occasionally changed velocity during movement (Movie S2). Some never or hardly moved during observation. We assessed whether the former shorter protrusions elongated to form the latter longer ones. However, the shorter protrusions barely elongated during the observation of EGFP fluorescence (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>RhoD generates two types of thin protrusions detected in unfixed cells.

Thus the protrusions are sensitive to physical and chemical stresses. At least some of the shorter protrusions detected in the fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and S1B) were therefore artifactually generated as a result of fixation and washing.

When we coexpressed mOrange2-tagged RhoD(G26V), C-terminally EGFP-tagged FGFR1c, and Cerulean-tagged wild-type Rab5 in 10T1/2 cells, FGFR1c and Rab5, which is localized to the early endosome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>), were associated with the nodules in the RhoD-formed protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref> and S1D and Movie S3). The nodules moved through the protrusions toward the cell body. Collectively these results suggest that cells extend protrusions toward FGF-sourcing cells through activation of RhoD and that the protrusions transmit FGFs via FGFRs to the cell body. At least some of these FGFs&#x02013;FGFRs might be transported in association with early endosome-like vesicles. Therefore these protrusions are likely to be involved in intercellular communication and morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes.</p></sec><sec><title>RhoD is activated by FGF signaling and required for FGF signaling&#x02013;mediated protrusion formation</title><p>Because the RhoD(wt)-expressing cells extended protrusions toward FGFs, and FGF stimulation facilitated protrusion formation in the cells, we addressed whether RhoD is activated by FGFs.

Because FGF8 activated RhoD more strongly and formed longer protrusions at 60 min than did FGF2 and FGF8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), there might be a correlation between the strength of RhoD activation and the length of the protrusions.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>RhoD is activated by FGF stimulation and required for FGF-induced protrusion formation.

These protrusions are relatively thick and stable and resistant to fixation. In contrast, cytonemes are thinner and sensitive to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ram&#x000ed;rez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>). Although molecular mechanisms of cytoneme formation have been obscure, we have shown here that RhoD-mediated signaling is responsible for the formation of cytoneme-like protrusions. Live imaging of unfixed EGFP&#x02013;RhoD(G26V)-transfected cells detected two types of protrusions, shorter motile and longer immotile protrusions. The shorter protrusions barely elongated during our observation of EGFP fluorescence. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the shorter protrusions elongate to become the longer ones. The longer protrusions were sensitive to physical and chemical stresses, such as washing and PFA fixation, and collapsed or fragmented. Thus both types of the protrusions might be unable to elongate under UV illumination applied to detect EGFP fluorescence. The protrusions induced by FGF stimulation in RhoD(wt)-transfected cells also hardly elongated during the observation of EGFP fluorescence. This result favors the above notion that the protrusions are sensitive to physical and chemical stresses. Accordingly, live imaging of unfixed cells is required to detect and analyze such structures.</p><p>Some of the RhoD-induced longer protrusions were &#x0003e;60 &#x000b5;m in length. They were much longer and thinner than filopodia induced by Cdc42 subfamily members or RhoF. The dimensional difference between the RhoD-induced protrusions and filopodia suggest that they are generated by distinct mechanisms and exert distinct functions. Although the length of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytonemes is variable, some cytonemes are as long as 80 &#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hsiung <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Roy <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Thus the length of RhoD-induced protrusions is comparable with that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytonemes, despite the difference between mammalian cell culture system and in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. Wing imaginal disk cells, eye disk cells, and tracheal cells extend cytonemes toward Dpp/BMP-, Spitz/EGF-, and Bnl/FGF-producing cells, respectively. These cytonemes segregate receptors of each morphogen/growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Roy <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The receptors move in both anterograde and retrograde directions in cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hsiung <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). RhoD(wt)-expressing 10T1/2 cells extended thin and long protrusions toward FGF2/4/8-coated beads or in response to stimulation with each of the FGFs separately. The RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusions also contained nodules moving in both directions, and most of the nodules eventually moved toward the cell body. FGFR1c coexpressed with RhoD(G26V) was associated with the nodules and moved through the protrusions. Therefore RhoD-induced protrusions are likely to be morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes. Although there is no RhoD orthologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, some Rho family protein, such as Rho-1 or Rac-1, which is most closely related to mammalian RhoD, might be involved in cytoneme formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Why is FGFR transported to the cell body through cytonemes or the RhoD-induced protrusions? Canonically, plasma membrane&#x02013;associated receptor tyrosine kinases activated by their growth factor ligands transduce signals into the Ras&#x02013;ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)&#x02013;Akt, or phospholipase C-&#x003b3; (PLC&#x003b3;) signaling, which is associated with the plasma membrane or the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). On the other hand, several growth factors and their receptor complexes, such as EGFs&#x02013;EGFRs and FGFs&#x02013;FGFRs, are also translocated to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Johnson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bryant and Stow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Carpenter and Liao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dunham-Ems <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Following activation by FGF, plasma membrane&#x02013;associated FGFR is internalized into early endosomal compartments, which is an essential early step in nuclear translocation of FGFR. FGF and FGFR are then released from the early endosomes to the cytosol, although it is unknown whether they are linked or separated at this time. They interact with nuclear import machinery, including importin &#x003b2;, in the cytosol and are translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, FGFs&#x02013;FGFRs interact with transcription regulators, such as CREB-binding protein and ribosomal S6 kinase 1, and participate in transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, or development. However, FGFs&#x02013;FGFRs should be unable to induce these nuclear events when they are on cytonemes or the RhoD-induced protrusions. This seems to be the reason why FGFR (as well as EGFR) is transported to the cell body through the protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p>Postulated mechanisms of the FGF&#x02013;RhoD&#x02013;mDia3C-induced protrusion formation and the transport of FGFRs through the protrusions. (A) RhoD is inactive without FGF stimulation. (B) If FGF, even at a low concentration, binds to its receptors, a GEF for RhoD is activated by FGFR signaling. The GEF then activates RhoD. (C) Activated RhoD binds to activate mDia3C. (D) Activated mDia3C nucleates and elongates actin filaments to form protrusions. (E) Cells extend the protrusions toward high concentrations of FGF or the source of FGF. Higher concentrations of FGF can efficiently bind to FGFRs. FGF&#x02013;FGFRs are transported through the protrusions either on the plasma membrane or on the early endosome-like vesicle membrane toward the cell body. (F) FGF&#x02013;FGFRs transported to the cell body activates the canonical Ras&#x02013;ERK, PI3K&#x02013;Akt, or PLC&#x003b3; signaling. FGF&#x02013;FGFRs are also translocated to the nucleus through early endosomal compartments and participate in transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, or development.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="4647fig9"/></fig><p>FGF2/4/8 activated RhoD, and activated RhoD was required for the FGF-induced protrusion formation. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has three <italic>FGF</italic> genes, including <italic>Bnl</italic>, whereas mouse or human has 22 <italic>FGF</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Itoh and Ornitz, 2011</xref>). Mammalian FGF2/4/8 function in a paracrine manner and act as morphogens or growth/differentiation factors in developing embryos. Analyses of gene-knockout mice have shown that the FGFs are involved in the development of particular tissues, such as the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Sun <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Itoh and Ornitz, 2011</xref>). Therefore cells in these tissues of developing embryos might also generate the cytoneme-like protrusions induced by these FGFs through the activation of RhoD.</p><p>Activated RhoD bound to mDia1 and mDia3A/B/C but not to mDia2 in vitro, whereas activated RhoD bound only to mDia3C in vivo. Although mDia1 and mDia2 were predominantly present in the cell body even when RhoD(G26V) was expressed, exogenously expressed mDia3A/B/C were concentrated in the RhoD-induced protrusions. These results may imply that mDia1 is not colocalized with RhoD in the cell body, even if it can bind to RhoD in vitro. On the other hand, although mDia3A/B have the potential to bind to RhoD, endogenous mDia3A/B might neither be associated with the protrusions nor be involved in the protrusion formation. Nevertheless, exogenously overexpressed mDia3A/B might be ectopically localized to the protrusions and displace endogenous mDia3C. The siRNA-resistant mDia3C, but not the siRNA-resistant mDia3A/B, rescued the cells from the interference with the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusion formation by the <italic>mDia3</italic> siRNA. These results imply that activated RhoD forms the protrusions through activating mDia3C but not mDia3A/B. Indeed, mDia3C (hDia2C) has been reported to be a specific effector of RhoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Gasman <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Activated RhoD binds to mDia3C and associates with early endosomes in the cell body. They induce an alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and markedly reduce the endosome motility by depending on Src tyrosine kinase activity. Thus RhoD is likely to utilize mDia3C for both the protrusion formation and the regulation of endosome movement through actin filaments. mDia3 is also localized to the kinetochores and involved in kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment required for correct chromosome alignment and segregation, which is regulated by Cdc42 or Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yasuda <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cheng <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Although it remains to be determined which mDia3 isoform(s) is responsible for this function, each of the mDia3 isoforms is likely to be regulated by specific signaling molecules and to exert specific functions.</p><p>Both mDia3C, together with active RhoD, and the constitutively active mDia3C(&#x00394;DAD) prominently enhanced actin polymerization. In addition, mDia3C(&#x00394;DAD) formed protrusions regardless of the expression of RhoD(G26V). mDia3C(&#x00394;DAD) was confined to the tips of the protrusions. These results may indicate that actin nucleation/elongation function of mDia3C, which is activated by RhoD, is essential for the protrusion formation. However, the protrusions formed by mDia3C(&#x00394;DAD) were thicker and contained actin filament bundles thicker than those in the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusions. Accordingly, although mDia3C is responsible for the thin actin filament bundle formation in the RhoD-induced protrusions, regulated activation of mDia3C mediated by RhoD may be required for the thin and long protrusion formation. Alternatively, cooperation between mDia3C and other effector proteins of RhoD might be necessary for the thin and long protrusion formation. The thicker protrusions are reminiscent of those formed by mDia2(&#x00394;DAD) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Block <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although the mDia2(&#x00394;DAD)-induced protrusions are club-shaped, however, mDia3C(&#x00394;DAD)-induced protrusions were rod-shaped or tapered and appeared to be longer than the mDia2(&#x00394;DAD)-induced protrusions. The difference might be ascribed to different nucleation/elongation abilities exhibited by these mDia proteins.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> summarizes postulated mechanisms of the protrusion formation by FGF-activated RhoD, elongation of the protrusions toward the source of FGF, and the transport of FGFRs through the protrusions. This study has substantiated the molecular mechanisms of cytoneme or cytoneme-like protrusion formation.
