Add your changes to this file, then practice pushing.
hello 
1. Make a change, save it
2. In the terminal:
    $ git status

      This will confirm that you made a change to a file. The file listed in read is known to have been edited. You need to tell git that you want to "commit" to those changes.

    $ git add <filename>

      This adds the file(s) that you want to include in your commit.

    $ git commit –m “<message content>”

      This finalizes your commit and allows you to include a message that explains what changes you made

    $git status

      This should show you that you have no pending changes needed to be committed
