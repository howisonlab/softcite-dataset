11 (Figure 1 12-20 Figure 2 12-24 Articles were selected if VPW was measured on CR in patients in either erect or supine positions and if volume overload had been evaluated by invasive and/or noninvasive techniques, including pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), global end diastolic volume, intrathoracic blood volume index, left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), or total blood volume. Studies that did not report a mean value or standard deviation (SD) were excluded. Two reviewers also independently assessed each included study and evaluated the quality of each article using the Jadad score. 25 The mean VPW, SD, correlation coefficient, and sample size were obtained from each study. Comprehensive meta- analysis software 2.2 and Stata 11 (College Station, Texas) were used for data analysis. 26 The summary effect of mean VPW (weighted mean) was estimated by assigning weight as the inverse of its variance method in the fixed effects of metaanalysis. 27 A random effect model, utilizing the DerSimonian and Laird method, estimated the summary effect of mean VPW. 28 Similarly, fixed and random effects were estimated for cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) as well as correlation coefficiency. Two subgroups, erect and supine, were analyzed for VPW values. The Q-test, which is a chi-square method, was used for comparison between these 2 groups based on Cochran method. 29 A P value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference between groups.

Data management and processing were performed usingReview Manager (RevMan) 5.0 software (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen) and Stata 11.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). The strength of the association between the IL-17 gene polymorphisms and cancer risk was measured by crude ORs and 95% CIs. The significance of the combined ORs was determined by a Z test, and two-sided P-value ,0.05 was considered significant.Stratified analyses were conducted with respect to cancer type and source of controls. Statistical heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using the chi square-based Q-test, and heterogeneity was considered significant when P,0.1 for Q statistic. Heterogeneity was quantified by I2 statistics examining the percentage of heterogeneity (0%-25% = no heterogeneity; 25%-50% = moderate heterogeneity; 50%-75% = large heterogeneity; and 75%-100% = extreme heterogeneity). 23 The random effects model was used when heterogeneity was significant (I 2 .50% or P#0.10); otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. Publication bias was examined with both Begg's funnel plot 24 and the Egger's regression method, 25 and P,0.05 was considered representative of statistically significant publication bias.

In order to establish whether OXPHOS defects observed upon inactivation of C7orf30 Figure 4) were a result of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we inhibited cytosolic translation and labelled de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with 35 S-Met. The incorporation of radioactive 35 S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed 6 days after the HeLa cells were transfected with C7orf30 siRNA. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon C7orf30 gene silencing, with incorporation of 35 S-Met reduced by <60% (for the more potent C7orf30 siRNA oligo 1) as compared to controls transfected with an unrelated siRNA (Figure 5A). In order to investigate whether inactivation of C7orf30 has an effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of lysates from HeLa cells transfected with C7orf30 siRNA for 6 days and control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNAwere quantified for C7orf30-depleted cells using ImageQuant software. Relative abundance is presented as a percentage of the steady-state level for control cells transected with an unrelated siRNA. n = 3, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test error bars = 1 SD. (C) OCR in C7orf30-depleted cells. OCR measured in an extracellular flux Seahorse instrument in control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNA or cells treated with siRNA to C7orf30 for 6 days. The wells containing cells were sequentially injected with 20 mM 2-DG to inhibit glycolysis, 100 nM oligomycin to inhibit ATP-synthase, 1 mM FCCP to uncouple the respiratory chain and 200 nM rotenone to inhibit complex I. n = 6, error bars = 1 SD. (D) Steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts upon inactivation of C7orf30. Total RNA from control cells (Ctrl) and cells transfected with two siRNAs specific for C7orf30 were analysed by northern blots using radioactive probes specific for the indicated mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA was used as a loading control. Figure 5G), consistent with a decrease in monosome formation, presumably due to alterations in mt-LSU integrity. These results, together with the observation that the steady-state levels of mitochondrial rRNAs were not changed (Figure 4D), suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial translation upon inactivation of C7orf30 could be attributed mainly to instability and/or impaired assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit, consequently interfering with formation of the mitochondrial monosome.

Original trace analysis (done and then compared with the method described here) was performed using a custom-written Lab- View (National Instruments, Austin, TX) software code similar to previously described procedures (Pitchiaya et al., 2012, 2013). In short, the LabView code uses noise-filtering and photon-counting histogram algorithms to identify particles of interest and removes nonuniform background from all selected traces. The data were filtered further by a nonlinear ChungKennedy noise filter to preserve fast and sudden signal transitions while averaging out random noise. The filtered data were then assessed by eye, with each sudden decrease in signal classified as a photobleaching event. For each trace, the number of photobleaching events corresponds to the total fluorescent miR-7 molecules within a focus since >90% of dye molecules are found to be fluorescent (Pitchiaya et al., 2012, 2013).

Background While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system. Methods We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male SpragueDawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only).HomeCageScan was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. Results Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour ( p<0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour ( p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups ( p<0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment ( p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA

For live-cell imaging of yeast strains carrying a plasmid, cells were grown at 25Â°C in SC media lacking a specific amino acid to select for the presence of a plasmid. For imaging yeast strains carrying a chs2 phosphomutation, cells were first grown in SC-LEU medium to keep them healthy and then washed twice with rich medium YM-1 without carbon source. Cells were then incubated further for 1-3 h at 25Â°C before being concentrated by centrifugation and spotted on a slab of YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose for live-cell imaging. For live-cell imaging at 37Â°C (Figure 6), the wild-type and the dbf2-1 dbf20Î strains were grown in liquid YM-1 media containing 2% raffinose at 25Â°C to the exponential phase and then shifted to 37Â°C for additional 3 h. A 2.0-ml culture was then transferred to a 3.5-mm dish coated with polylysine (MatTek, Ashland, MA), which was incubated in the 37Â°C chamber of the microscope for 20 min to let the cells settle down. A 1.5-ml culture was then removed from the dish, which was followed by the addition of a 1.5-ml prewarmed YM-1 medium containing 2% raffinose, 3% galactose, and 1.5% low-melting agarose. Images were acquired at 25 or 37Â°C on a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 scan head combined with an Olympus IX 71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an Olympus 100Ã objective (1.4 numerical aperture, Plan S-Apo oil immersion).

The GenomeRNAi database presents phenotype information of large-scale screens in the context of associated sequence information. We believe that this is an important issuesince in contrast to genetic mutants, RNAi phenotypes depend on the specificity of the used siRNAs or dsRNAs (21-23). Furthermore, with changes in gene models, RNAi phenotypes attributed to a specific gene may be linked to a different gene in the future. Similar limitations apply to RNAi reagents targeting specific splice variants of genes. RNAi libraries evolve, as we learn more about the RNAi mechanism and potential pitfalls such as off-target effects second generation libraries will incorporate these findings into design rules and attempt to generate more specific. The GenomeRNAi database is linked to other databases, such as FLIGHT and FlyRNAi (24,25). While all these databases contain RNAi phenotype information, the focus of GenomeRNAi is to present phenotypes in the context of genomic information, which should facilitate the analysis of RNAi phenotypes with respect to gene models and specificity information. GenomeRNAi has an integrated pipeline for mapping of RNAi probes and phenotypes and integrating the information of different RNAi libraries, but the focus is less on the integration of different genomic datasets as provided by FLIGHT.

This is the first randomized controlled trial report to date of using NIV ventilator equipped with built-in software to monitor the ventilator parameters in home setting in stable hypercapnic COPD patients. In order to estimate the accuracy of built-in software in ventilators, data downloaded from software were compared using the PowerLab system. The finding showed that the estimation of leak and pressure was a low mean bias value between built-in software and PowerLab system. Previous study showed that the rate of abnormalities was 66% and leak was the most common abnormality (34.2%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8%) in home NPPV. 19 In addition, studies have further reported that leak increases ineffective trigger, patient-ventilator asynchrony, and hypoventilation in patients. 20-22 In our study, the mean estimation of leak was 37.99 L/min and 87% of the leaks were ,40 L/min, which was greatly lower than the threshold leak influencing the effects of NPPV as reported by previous study, 23 which could ensure the appropriateness of NIV use and reliability of the results.

BG2 cells were obtained from Drosophila Genome Resource Center (Cell line stock number, 51), and cultured according to the protocol form the provider (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/ include/file/general_maintenance.pdf). BG2 cells with or without SP treatment were lysed in protein extraction buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 8 M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM PMSF. After sonication, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, UK). Protein samples (100 Î¼g each) were chemically reduced (5 mM, DTT) and alkylated (25 mM, IAA) prior to trypsin digestion. After 4-fold dilution with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), the protein samples were enzymatically digested using a sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37Â°C for 16 h. Digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 90% formic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Resulting tryptic digest peptide samples were desalted for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment procedure. Phosphopeptides enriched with IMAC POROS 20 MC were subsequently subjected to the micro RPLC-MS/MS analysis described previously (Choi et al., 2011). Briefly, analyses of phosphopeptide-enriched samples were performed using Agilent 1100 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Finnigan, USA). The resulting MS/MS spectra searched against a composite protein database containing the IPI mouse protein database (v.3.28), and its reversed complement using SEQUEST algorithm (Sor- cerer system). Differential modification search options for phosphorylation modification (+80 on Ser, Thr, Tyr), and oxidation (+16 on Met), were considered in the search. 'Peptide prophet' and 'Protein prophet' scores of 90% was used to filter the search results. We applied the log2(protein ratio) from relative spectral counts (Rsc) for label free quantification (Old et al., 2005). RSC = log2[(n2 + f)/(n1 + f)] + log2[(t1 -n1 + f)/(t2 -n2 + f)] where, for each protein, RSC is the log2 ratio of abundance between Samples 1 and 2; n1 and n2 are spectral counts for the protein in Samples 1 and 2, respectively; t1 and t2 are total numbers of spectra over all proteins in control and SP-treated samples; and Æ is a correction factor, set to 0.5 (Beissbarth et al., 2004). Ammonium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), sodium chloride, sodium orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ), sodium fluoride (NaF), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium Î²-glycerophosphate, urea and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ) were purchased from Sigma (USA). Formic acid (FA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Merck (Germany). HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN), methanol and deionized water were all purchased from Fisher Science.

We further analyzed the contrast responses, in particular those genes that were selectively or hyper-induced in BJ LTSTERas cells compared with BJ cells, using GO analyses and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Genes involved in 'induction of programmed cell death' (P Â¼ 0.0130) and 'apoptotic program' (P Â¼ 0.0024) were over-represented in vorinostat-treated BJ LSTRas cells compared with BJ cells (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Many genes encoding components of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway wereselectively induced in BJ LTSTERas cells. A candidate approach was subsequently undertaken to more thoroughly investigate the transcriptional regulation of apoptotic pathway components by vorinostat using the IPA program. Vorinostat treatment resulted in decreased expression of TNFRSF6 (FAS), TNFRSF10A (DR4/TRAILR1) and TNFRSF1A (TNFa receptor) in both normal and transformed fibroblasts (Figures 4a and b). Only a mild tumor-selective induction of TNFRSF10B (DR5/TRAILR2) was observed. We did not observe any transcriptional modulation of genes encoding death receptor ligands in response to vorinostat in either cell type (Figures 4a and b). Moreover, the genes encoding FADD (FADD), caspase 8 (CASP8) and BID were downregulated in BJ and BJ LTSTERas, suggesting that death receptor signaling was transcriptionally repressed by vorinostat in BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. Collectively, the downregulation of genes encoding receptors, adaptors and proteolytic intermediaries in the death receptor pathway suggested that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was unlikely to play a substantial role in promoting selective apoptosis of BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts.

These curves were plotted using the quadratic equations provided by the authors and demonstrate the variability between calibration curves using automated slidescoring based versions of the CBMN assay. In addition, Figure 5B demonstrates that the rate of MN per BNC has increased by a factor of about six at the 4 Gy dose, illustrating the effectiveness and accuracy of both the optimized BNC and MN masks.

This paper has introduced the application of new features and masks developed in the IDEAS software designed specifically for improved detection of BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay with applications in radiation biodosimetry. Using these tools, an optimized data analysis template was created which more effectively identified BNCs and quadrupled the frequency of scored MN across the 0-4 Gy dose range. This new analysis method allowed for the generation of a dose response calibration curve that was similar in magnitude to those presented in the literature which were generated by automated slide scoring methods. Finally, dose estimations of blinded samples were correctly generated to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose following only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS X , a marked improvement over our previous work. The improved analysis template, combined with the reduction in data collection time on the IS X , will allow for increased accuracy and throughput when performing biodosimetry to estimate unknown radiation doses received by exposed individuals following large-scale radiological or nuclear emergencies.

The General de Gaulle government in France followed suit, declaring that the state "must hold the levers of command." Similarly, after the independence of India, Prime Minister Nehru often evoked the commanding-heights metaphor. Typically, these countries, as well as Germany, Korea, Japan, many Latin American countries, and of course, all socialist countries, had strong state control/ownership over strategic sectors such as defense, iron and steel, railroads, ship-building, utilities, and telecom. In these sectors, the key consideration for decentralization is likely not to utilize local information but to ensure the benefits of "strategic control."

A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the presence of C. coli. This in itself is simply an observation and merely demonstrates an increased presence of C. coli in cats with neutrophilic inflammation. However, FISH neutrophil elastase probes demonstrated close proximity to neutrophils and confirmed the possible association with C. coli. No association between neutrophil location and other species of bacteria was demonstrated. This association supports the hypothesis that C. coli is particularly associated with a specific neutrophilic form of inflammation in the duodenal mucosa of cats with enteric disease compared with other microorganisms.

Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain Complex-To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8) using the parallel version of the SUPERPOSE program (30). This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by CAMDAS. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogenbond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 Ã) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental Table S1). One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes (Fig. 4C). The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes were calculated by SYBYL 7.3 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) on an Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 central processing units).

R-loopDB currently covers eight organisms, including human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken, frog, fruit fly and yeast. Supplementary Table S1 provides information on the genome assemblies of these species. Using QmRLFS- finder (22), we significantly extended the list of RLFSs and RLFS-positive genes in the human genome compared to the previous version (18). The summary statistics of RLFSs, RLFS-merged regions and RLFS-positive genes presented in the previous and updated R-loopDBs are shown in Table 1. For instance, 511 651 RLFSs (or 169 222 RLFSmerged regions) were computationally predicted in genic regions and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the genes, whereas, in the previous R-loopDB, 245 181 RLFSs (or 140 106 RLFS-merged regions) were found in the UCSC-defined gene regions.

Datasets in each series were analyzed by Gene- Spring software (v7.3.1; Agilent) using GCRMA normalization and with the cross-gene error model activated. In each case, samples were grouped as normal or diseased, and a parametric t-test was per-formed to obtain genes with statistically significant differences. The p-value cutoff was set at 0.05 and a Benjamin Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction was included. These restrictions would allow about 5% of the tested genes on the GeneChip (total 54,675) to qualify by random chance. This gene list was further filtered to obtain genes that showed at least a two-fold differential expression between the normal and diseased states, which generated between 1,300 to 3,700 differentially expressed genes for the four cancer datasets (Table 1). Protein sequences corresponding to these genes were obtained from GenBank and UniProt databases.

For prison sentence length, we have constructed binary outcome variables indicating if an individual has spent a total of at least x months in prison (where x isSibling correlations are estimated using STATA's xtlogit command. All outcome variables are dichotomous. Birth year and gender dummies are included. Standard errors are in parentheses. Singletons are included, except in the estimation of the mixed siblings. Estimates are not sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of singletons equal to 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 12 months). We show the intensive margin correlations in Fig. 1 along with approximate 95 % confidence intervals. The trend line in Fig. 1 is upward sloping for sibling correlations in crime. This means that factors shared by siblings account for a larger share of the variation in crime at the intensive margin. For instance, for sisters, the share of the variation that can be attributed to factors shared by siblings is more than twice as high for "at least 10 crimes" than for "at least 1 crime."

The highest correlations are the correlations for property crime for men and women, which are both 0.03. These correlations indicate that at most 3 % of the variation in property crime can be attributed to shared neighborhood factors. These 36 Most Swedish studies using observational data tend to find limited influences of neighborhoods on children's outcomes (e.g., BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m 2004 and Lindahl 2011). However, several quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated that growing up in an ethnic enclave in Sweden does have an important effect on children's outcomes (e.g., Edin et al. 2003 andÃslund et al. 2011). 37 We cannot get information on schools attended nor on the Small Area Marketing Statistics used to define neighborhoods in Sariaslan et al. (2013), since the cohorts we study are too old.Neighborhood correlations are estimated using STATA's xtlogit command after first randomly drawing one individual from each family. This random draw is done separately for each of the three sample used. All outcome variables are dichotomous. Birth year and gender dummies are included. Controls for parental education and income, parental criminality, and family structure are also included in order to net out sorting into neighborhoods. Standard errors are in parentheses should be contrasted with our brother and sister correlations in "at least one property crime," which are 0.38 and 0.34, respectively. Thus, neighborhood effects appear to be able to explain approximately 7 % of the sibling correlation in property crime at the extensive margin. Given that we have included all of the family-wide controls used in Section 5, these 7 % can be added on to the 27 % explained in the previous section. Thus, it appears that we can account for as much as one third of the sibling correlation at the extensive margin. The intensive margin neighborhood correlations are again computed using binary outcome variables. We show the neighborhood correlations for up to 10 crimes and up to 1 year in prison in Fig. 6. In Appendix Fig. 8, we show separate figures for each crime type.

A collection of 248 B. napus accessions was used for association mapping (see Supplementary Table S1 2008 and 2009, respectively). Under these growth conditions, in central China both semi-winter and winter types are generally sufficiently vernalized to flower after winter. Spring type accessions grown under these conditions do not usually start flowering before the onset of winter. During the winter months, plant growth slows down or comes to a halt, but the relatively mild winter temperatures at the chosen location in central China generally allows the spring types to survive as well. Flowering time in both field trials was recorded as the days from sowing to the date when the first flower had opened on half of the plants of an accession. Furthermore, accessions were classified as spring, semi-winter or winter types according to the annotation of the original cultivars (Chinese Crop Germplasm Information System (CGRIS), http://icgr.caas.net.cn/cgris_english.html) or their general performance in the field (see Supplementary Table S (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA of positive BAC clones was extracted using the NucleoBondÃ PC 500 plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey & Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, DÃ¼ ren, Germany). Sequence identity or homology to the probe fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of BAC DNA using primer pair A102-A103. The BAC clones were grouped into three sequence groups according to a multiple sequence alignment using the AlignX module of the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, USA). To identify the full-length genomic sequences, one BAC of each group was selected for primer walking using primers A127, A133, A201, A248, A249, A250, A260, A261, A262, A372, and A378 (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). The genes were annotated using pairwise sequence alignments (BLAST2; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with FRI and the FGE- NESH+ and  FGENESH_C gene prediction programs (http:// linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml). Orthology was inferred by bidirectional best hit analysis (Overbeek et al., 1999) using the B. napus genes as queries for BLASTX searches against the A. thaliana protein database at TAIR (http://www. arabidopsis.org). Following the nomenclature for Brassica genes (Ostergaard and King, 2008), the three FRI homologues were designated as BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, and BnaX.FRI.c.

14 The model has three economic agents: producers, representative consumers (private and public) and trading partners. The GTAP6inGAMS model is a traditional static Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model in which the zero profit condition and market clearance define the equilibrium. The GTAP6inGAMS is a modified version of the GTAP model version 6 developed for GAMS users. Most of the model specifications are the same as the GTAP model. The differences between the GTAP model and GAMS version of the model are as follows. First, the GTAP model is based on a constant difference elasticity demand system, but the GAMS model uses Cobb-Douglas preferences. Second, the GTAP model assumes that global capital is endogenously allocated by regional rates of return. However, for 12.

Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in Table 1). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a ChinaJapan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.

We next wondered whether the same pharmacological inhibitors could influence the activity of the known BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Therefore, a reporter construct harboring the previously described 1500 bp BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter (34) was transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells, which were either left untreated or pre-treated with inhibitors for CN, NF-kB or p38 for 30 min before the stimulation with P/I. These experiments revealed that the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter is sensitive to all of the analysed inducers and inhibitors, similar to the octamer-dependent reporter (Figure 1B). To explore whether protein expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 mirrors its promoter activity, Jurkat T cells and primary CD4 + cells isolated from lymph nodes of C57BL/6 wild-type mice were either left untreated or pre-treated for 30 min with the inhibitors used in the previous experiments and subsequently stimulated with P/I. Interestingly, we found a striking coregulation of Oct2 and BOB.1/OBFInterestingly, EMSA studies (Supplementary Figure S1) revealed that the NF-kB inhibitor Bay11-7082 inhibits additionally NFAT binding to DNA and, vice versa, the CN inhibitors CsA and FK506 interfere with NFAT binding but also with the NF-kB signaling pathway, as it was described recently (44,45). Therefore, the observed effect of CsA and FK506 on BOB.1/OBF.1 expression is not only mediated by inhibiting NFAT activity, as these compounds also affect the activity of NF-kB, but rather by the combined activity of NFAT and NF-kB. However, treatment of murine primary CD4 + T cells or transfected Jurkat cells with specific NFAT and NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitors, like the NFAT inhibitory peptide 11 R-VIVIT and the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding peptide, respectively, clearlyThe BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter contains several binding sites for NFAT and NF-iB Previously, the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter was analysed to identify regulatory elements responsible for its activity in B cells (34-36). In those studies, a functional cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) site could be identified, which is crucial for the B lymphocyte specific activity of the promoter. In addition, a sequence related to a NFAT binding site was described, however without any functional relevance for the B cell-specific BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter activity. In search for possible additional transcription factor binding sites using the Genomatrix Software, we identified two combined NFAT/NF-kB binding sites within the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Both newly identified sites are conserved between rat, mouse and man, suggesting a possible functional relevance of these regulatory elements. In contrast to B cells, where a function of the predicted NFAT binding site has not been revealed (34), an inducible complex formation could be detected after P/I treatment of primary CD4 + T cells. This complex resembles that formed at the NFAT site of the IL2 promoter used in control experiments (Figure 2 Figure S2). Together, our data suggest that NFAT and NF-kB family members are able to bind to all of these newly identified potential cis-acting elements of the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter in vitro.

By focusing on the individual participants rather than the platform, we need to adopt a performance measure that will reflect this perspective (instead of plaform market shares or winner-take-all competition). We do so by adopting the concept of "allocative efficiency" (Gode and Sunder 1993, 1997). In its most generic form, "allocative efficiency is the ratio of the actual to the potential gains from trade" (Gode and Sunder 1997: 603). The upper bound of the "potential gains" is reached when the participants can make all the transactions they desire, either as suppliers when they share their possessions, or as customers by accessing the shared goods. Concretely, on the demand side, Airbnb is functioning efficiently if the guests find a room when they desire to travel or BlaBlacar is efficient when there is a seat available for one's desired journey. On the supply side, both the revenue and the efficient utilization of our shareable possessions are impacted if an Airbnb host or a BlaBlaCar traveler cannot find a buyer. From the public good perspective, such a failure can be seen as proof that profit-based platforms cannot provide the basic level of service required by Universal Service obligations (Slee 2016) or provided by incumbent firms (Cusumano 2015).

A series of cryogenic experiments was performed at the Janus Laser Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a schematic of which is shown in Fig. 2. A drive laser was focused onto a cryogenic target, launching a shock wave into liquid deuterium at an initial density r 0 Â¼ 0.17 Â± 0.004 g cm Ã 3 . A second laser, incident on a Si 3 N 4 foil fixed to the target at an intensity of 1 Ã 10 14 W cm Ã 2 and wavelength of 527 nm, created an intense x-ray source by pumping the 2 keV Ly-a line in SiThe copper target is held at 19 K, liquefying the deuterium that is filled into the central cavity. A drive laser is incident on a 2-mm-diameter Al pusher, launching a shock wave along the axis. A probe laser irradiates a Si 3 N 4 foil, pumping the 2,005 eV Si Ly-a transition. X-rays scattered in the forward and backward directions are spectrally dispersed with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals whose direct view of the laser-plasma is prevented by Ni shields. (b) Cross section of the target reservoir across the thickness of the target. The target is sealed with aluminium on the front surface and a transparent quartz rear window to allow the VISAR beam to probe shock evolution. (c) Schematic of laser beam timing showing the shock drive beam (red) of 2-6 ns preceding a 2-ns probe pulse. The probe is delayed by 10-20 ns, depending on drive intensity, to allow the shock front to advance into the x-ray spectrometer view. Shorter delay times yielded higher shock pressures. (d) HYDRA simulations of mass density evolving as a function of space and time, with a lineout at the x-ray probe time of 20 ns. The compressed D 2 peak (r Shock Â¼ 0.54 g cm Ã 3 ) has traversed into the spectrometer field of view at t Â¼ 20 ns when we make the x-ray measurement. The high-density peak lagging the D 2 shock front is due to the aluminium pusher, but is shielded by the x-ray window.These photons were collimated through a 400-mm-diameter aperture in the target, timed to probe the shock as it reached the x-ray collection ports. The x-rays were scattered from the shock front and collected through 400 mm ports at 45Â°and 135Â°from the incident photons. The probe pulse was delayed 10-20 ns after the rise of the drive beam, allowing the shock to traverse a distance of 350 mm to reach the volume accessed by the x-ray diagnostic port. The fields of view of the spectrometers were shielded with Ni-coated cones (40Â°opening angle) from ambient x-ray emission and stray light from both laser beams. The radiation was collected and spectrally dispersed with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal spectrometers 35 curved at a 107-mm radius. The drive laser beam used a phase plate to produce a round 600-mm-diameter spot on target. The forward scattering measurements were made on deuterium shock-driven by a frequency-doubled 2-ns-long laser pulse producing a wavelength of 527 nm at the target. The backscattering measurements were made operating the same laser at the 1,054 nm fundamental. These shots used 4 ns drive pulses at moderate compression and 6 ns at higher compression, all at nominal intensities of 4 Ã 10 13 W cm Ã 2 .

I collect data on how subjects acquire information about risky choices in both real and hypothetical settings using process-tracing software called Mouselab. On average, there are no significant differences across settings in the amount of time subjects take to make a choice or the completeness of the information they acquire. Subjects also acquire information in sequences consistent with an integration model of decision-making, such as expected utility theory or prospect theory. I do not find significant differences in risk preferences across settings, on average, but I do find that subjects' risk preferences are related to the completeness of the information that they acquire and where they start their information acquisition. (JEL C91, D80, D83) (Levitt and List 2007) Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 265) (Battalio, Kagel, and Jiranyakul 1990; Harrison 2006; Holt and Laury 2002, 2005) (Beattie and Loomes 1997; KÃ¼hberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Perner 2002; Wiseman and Levin 1996) Taylor (2013) cognitive ability tend to make choices exhibiting hypothetical bias. 2 These contradictory results have yet to be explained. Camerer and Hogarth (1999) illustrate that real incentives are likely to alter behavior when the task involved depends on the subject's effort level. But the choices that are typically used to measure risk aversion are designed to measure preferences, not effort. Moreover, while it is clear how economic incentives can cause individuals to misrepresent their willingness to pay for clean air in a survey that could influence environmental policy, there is not an obvious economic motivation for why individuals would systematically misrepresent their risk preferences so that they appear more risk tolerant when they make choices with hypothetical consequences. 3 This study uses a method of process tracing to explore whether individuals acquire information about the risky choices in the commonly used Holt and Laury multiple-price list (HL MPL) differently when the choices have hypothetical monetary consequences rather than real monetary consequences (Holt and Laury 2002). It is possible that individuals may attend to the information in hypothetical choices differently than real choices, and several studies have demonstrated that how individuals acquire information can be related to their decision-making. For instance, Costa-Gomes and Crawford (2006) show that simplified searches are correlated with deviations from equilibrium in a two-person guessing game, and Caplin, Dean, and Martin (2011) find that search patterns can affect subjects' decisions conditional on choice complexity.

This cross-sectional descriptive analytic study was based on 67 women in the age range of 36 to 92 years old who were referred to the Radiology Department of Mashhad Dental School. All of them had a panoramic radiography in their orders and none of the participants was known to have any prior fracture and systemic disease that would affect bone metabolism (chronic renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, gastrointestinal disease, paget's disease or rheumatoid arthritis). They were not using specific drugs or hormones (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, heparin, estrogen, progesterone, androgen and excess thyroid hormone). The data regarding age and BMI (body mass index) was obtained by questionnaire. All the panoramic radiographs were taken with PM 2002 CC apparatus (Planmeca Oy, Asentajankatu 6, 00880 Helsinki, Finland) by a single operator (AB). The position of the head was standardized as much as possible and also the exposure factors (kVp, mA) were regulated for each patient. To have similar density and contrast in all radiographs, we used both AGFA Dentus panoramic film (Heraeus Kulzer, Belgium) and Kodak screens (Kodak Lanex Regular Screen, Eastman Kodak Company, USA). Processing of the films was automatically performed by Pro- tec processor (PROTEC medical systems, Stuttgart, Germany). For examination of the bone mineral density, DXA (Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry) scans were performed with Osteocore 2 (MEDILINK, France). This technique is widely accepted as the "gold standard" method of clinical bone mineral measurements [9,10]. DXA itself is subject to some minor inaccuracy in BMD measurement [6]. Precision of DXA ranges from 0.55 to 5% [11]. Sixty-seven panoramic radiographs were analyzed for MCI, MI and PMI. According to Jowitt et al [12], "MCI is classification of the appearance of the mandibular inferior cortex distal to the mental foramen, which includes the following criteria: C1: The endosteal margin of the cortex is even and sharp on both sides of the mandible. (Fig 2). All the measurements were made in millimeters (0.1 mm variation) with calipers by the same investigator (AB). The indices were measured bilaterally and the mean was recorded for each patient. When only one foramen was visible, the measurements were done only on that side [18]. The information on age and BMD statuses of the patients was blinded to the examiner in order to eliminate information bias. Afterwards we gave the patients their radiographs and referred them to Toos Bone Densitometry Center for BMD testing. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to carry out bone densitometry as a part of the study on osteoporosis. BMD testing was per-The endosteal margin has semilunar defects (resorption cavities) with cortical residues one to three layers thick on one or both sides.

One possible way to calculate the dispersion of the direct and indirect effects is to apply formulae for the sum, the difference, the product and the quotient of random variables (see, among others, Mood et al., 1974, pp. 178Ã181). However, owing to the complexity of the matrix of partial derivatives [see (6)] and because every empirical application will have its own unique number of observations (N) and spatial weights matrix (W), it is almost impossible to derive one general approach that can be applied under all circumstances. In order to draw inferences regarding the statistical significance of the direct and indirect effects, LeSage & Pace (p. 39) therefore suggest simulating the distribution of the direct and indirect effects using the varianceÃcovariance matrix implied by the maximum likelihood estimates. Elhorst & FrÃ©ret (2009) Using the Matlab routine 'sar' posted on LeSage's website (www.spatial- econometrics.com), one particular parameter combination drawn from this varianceÃcovariance matrix (indexed by d ) can be obtained by:

The data was analyzed using the EVOC (Ensemble de Programmes Permettant LÂ´Analyse des Ãvocations) (Group of Programs for the Analysis of Evoked Responses) 2003 software, which allows one to achieve the organization of the words based on the hierarchy expressed through the frequency and the natural order of the evocation, through the construction of the VergÃ¨s matrix, where the evoked words are distributed, considering the criteria of higher frequencies and mean order of evocation (MOE)(6-7). This corresponds to four quadrants, in which in the top left one may observe the elements with a frequency which is higher than, or equal to, the mean frequency, and with a lower mean order of evocation (evoked more readily). In the top right quadrant, one finds the more important peripheral elements, due to their higher frequencies. In the bottom right quadrant, one finds elements which are less frequent and less-readily evoked, and in the bottom left quadrant there are the elements which, in spite of presenting low frequencies, are considered highly important because of the privileged order of evocation (5).

As noted in Online Appendix A, the variable Asset has a very high proportion of zero's. This would imply that the individual's relative risk aversion is infinite, a rather extreme assumption. We tested the sensitivity to this extreme value by adding a dummy to distinguish zero and positive values; thus, the regression equation included 17 In Footnote 14 Shaw also notes that she dropped interaction of the intercept with the risk attitude dummies. We decided not to follow her and stick to the full model. 18 Since comparing estimates involves combined coefficients (e.g. Î² Â·a xi ), we need to take into account the standard deviation of such combination. This is done by using the "nonlinear combinations of estimators" option in STATA. 19 For Italy the null hypothesis is not rejected for the interaction between ARA and years of schooling.a dummy for having any risky financial assets at all and the share of risky financial assets. In the SHIW data for Italy, with the highest proportion of zero's, including the dummy has no effect on the results for the other variables; the significance level for the share of risky assets does not change in any relevant way. 20

In order to determine whether the OXPHOS defect in cells overexpressing PDE12 is a consequence of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we labelled the de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with radioactive methionine. After the inhibition of cytosolic translation, the incorporation of 35 S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed over a time course of 4 days in HEK293T cells overexpressing PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant (Figure 6A). Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon the induction of PDE12 overexpression and the incorporationwere analysed by northern blots using probes specific for all mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28 S rRNA was used as a loading control. (D) Quantification of steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts in cells overexpressing PDE12. The values of the relative RNA levels (mt-RNA/28 S rRNA) were obtained by quantifying PhosphorImager scans of northern blots using ImageQuant software and normalized for the values obtained from uninduced cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. (E) mtDNA copy number in cells overexpressing PDE12. Comparative Q-PCR of the mitochondrial CytB gene and single copy nuclear gene (APP) was used with total DNA isolated from cells overexpressing PDE12 for the indicated time. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. of 35 S-Met was $15% of those in uninduced cells (Figure 6B). Overexpression of the E351A mutant did not have any appreciable effect upon mitochondrial protein synthesis (Figure 6B). Next, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of cell extracts from cells overexpressing PDE12 for 4 days and control cells in order to investigate the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome (Figure 6C). In this method, we detected the 28 S (small) and 39 S (large) subunits by western blotting of gradient fractions. We used DAP3/MRPS29 as a marker for the 28 S ribosomal subunit and MRPL3 as a marker for the 39 S subunit. The analyses of sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits upon overexpression of PDE12 revealed: (i) deficiency of assembled 28 S mitoribosomal subunits as compared to the control and (ii) anomalous sedimentation of the 39 S subunits that was shifted towards slower migrating species (Figure 6C). These changes in mitoribosomes were not due to any alteration in the length of the mitochondrial rRNAs, based on RNase protection assays of 12 S and 16 S rRNA (Supplementary Figure S4A-B). Nor was the steady-state level or length of 7 mt-tRNAs (Ser-UCN, Leu-UUR, Thr, Gln, Pro, Lys and Phe) affected by elevated PDE12 expression (Supplementary Figure S4C-D). However, in the case of tRNASer-AGY the steady-state level of the full-length molecule was $60% of the control value after 4 days of PDE12 overexpression and a species of lower molecular mass was detected. A similar truncated form of tRNASer-AGY, albeit of much lower abundance, was observed in control cells (Supplementary Figure S4C). Mutant tRNA levels considerably >50% are needed to produce a mitochondrial translation defect (24) and so the observed inhibition of mitochondrial translation is most likely attributable to the shortening of the mt-RNA poly(A) tails, owing to mitochondrial ribosome instability and/or impaired assembly.

In situ trace element analyses of amphibole, clinopyroxene and plagioclase were carried out on polished thin sections by LA-ICP-MS using a Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100 DRC ICP-MS equipped with a 193 nm EXCIMER Geolas laser at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). Operating conditions of the laser were: 8 Hz frequency, 100 mJ energy, 35 or 60 mm spot size. CaO contents determined by microprobe in the area of subsequent ablation with the laser were used for internal standardization by reference to an SRM612 NIST external standard. Raw data were reduced off-line using the LAMTRACE software 55-57., the projected vapour1liquid coexistence surface for salinities of 10 wt.% and 30-45 wt.% NaCl (green, extrapolated above 1000uC) and the vapour1liquid1halite coexistence curve (blue) from 59 (V5vapour, L5liquid, H5halite, F5single-phase fluid). The orange path 1 represents a hypothetical fluid-unsaturated (e.g., H 2 O52.5 wt.%) basaltic andesite/ andesite magma that ascends rapidly to shallow level until it becomes fluidsaturated upon hitting the 2.5 wt.% H 2 O boundary. This magma will exsolve a fluid below the vapour1liquid coexistence line and will not have significantly high Sr/Y because it will not fractionate amphibole. If the same magma undergoes isobaric crystallization at P. ,0.2 GPa (red paths 2) it will eventually become fluid-saturated in the single-phase fluid field, above the vapour1liquid coexistence line. Because amphibole always precedes plagioclase crystallization above the vapour1liquid coexistence line in andesitic magmas and almost at any pressure above the V1L coexistence line for basaltic andesite magmas (except a small gap between ,0.19 and ,0.22 GPa), it follows that development of high Sr/Y signatures and exsolution of fluids in the single phase field are intimately bound together. Hydrous andesitic magmas rising rapidly to shallow levels have magnetite close to the liquidus (orange path 1), which might cause sulphide saturation before fluid exsolution, depending on the initial water content of the magma. In contrast, andesitic magmas evolving at P.0.2 GPa and thus acquiring high Sr/Y signatures (red paths 2) will crystallize magnetite late thus making possible the partitioning of Cu into an exsolved fluid before magnetite-induced sulphide saturation incorporates magmatic Cu.
