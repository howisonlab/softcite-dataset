            "text": "Observing WZ/ZZ production at the Tevatron in a final state with a lepton, missing transverse energy and jets is extremely difficult because of the low signal rate and the huge background. In an attempt to increase the acceptance we study the sample where three high-energy jets are reconstructed, where about 1/3 of the diboson signal events are expected to end. Rather than choosing the two E T -leading jets to detect a Z signal, we make use of the information carried by all jets. To qualify the potential of our method, we estimate the probability of observing an inclusive diboson signal at the three standard deviations level (P 3\u03c3 ) to be about four times larger than when using the two leading jets only. Aiming at applying the method to the search for the exclusive WZ/ZZ\u2192 \u03bdqq channel in the three jets sample, we analyzed separately the sample with at least one b-tagged jet and the sample with no tags. In WZ/ZZ\u2192 \u03bdbb search, we observe a modest improvement in sensitivity over the option of building the Z-mass from the two leading jets in E T . Studies for improving the method further are on-going.",

In particular the predicted W \u00b1 , Z couplings (Trilinear Gauge Couplings) are sensitive to new physics. The study of associated WZ boson production in the final state \u03bdbb is important since the event topology of this process is the same as expected for WH associated production (M H 135 GeV) [1]. Observing this process at Tevatron is difficult since the event rate is extremely low. NLO calculations predict WZ production cross section to be \u223c3.22 pb [2]. Thus, one expects a handful of events per fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity in the \u03bdqq final state, after allowing for trigger and kinematical selection efficiency 1 . Furthermore, the signal to background ratio is very poor, due primarily to the production of W and associated jets. Since the preferred method used at CDF to disentangle the diboson signal from the backgrounds is a fit to the invariant mass of the two E T -leading jets, an optimal resolution in jet systems mass is of utmost importance.",
