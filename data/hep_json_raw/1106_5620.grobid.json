After 20 years of design, construction and preparation of the experiments and the accelerator, the LHC started operating in November 2009 with pp collisions at \u221a s = 900 GeV and reached its current maximum energy of 7 TeV in March 2010. The primary ALICE goal for pp was to collect about 10 9 minimum bias (MB) collisions under clean experimental conditions. The total pp data sample collected at 7 TeV (900 GeV) corresponds to some 800 M (8 M) MB triggers, 100 M muon triggers and about 20 M high multiplicity events. In addition, a short pp run was taken in March 2011 at the Pb-Pb energy of 2.76 TeV to collect a minimum set of comparison data (recording 70 M MB events and integrating 20 nb \u22121 of luminosity for rare triggers). Early physics results from the proton runs are summarized in [1].",

As was the case for proton beams, the LHC worked exceedingly well also for heavy ions, with a steeply increasing luminosity which reached about 2 10 25 cm \u22122 s \u22121 towards the end of the run and yielded some 30 M nuclear MB interactions on tape. Initial results on global event characteristics (charged particle multiplicities, elliptic flow, volume and lifetime inferred from pion HBT, and high p T suppression) became available already during or shortly after the run [2]. At this conference, a second wave of results from ALICE will be presented in close to 40 talks and 70 posters. The following will be a very brief 'guided tour' through some of the highlights, while more details, references and figures can be found in the individual ALICE contributions to these proceedings.",

The value finally measured with Pb-Pb at 2.76 TeV/nucleon, dN ch /d\u03b7 \u2248 1600, was somewhat on the high side of more recent (post-RHIC) predictions but well below the maximum values (> 4000) anticipated during the design phase of ALICE in the early 90's. From the measured multiplicity in central collisions one can derive a rough estimate of the energy density, which is at least a factor 3 above RHIC. The corresponding increase of the initial temperature is about 30%, even with the conservative assumption that the formation time \u03c4 0 does not decrease from RHIC to LHC. When combined with lower energy data, the charged particle production per participant pair, (dN ch /d\u03b7)/(0.5N part ), is seen to rise with centre of mass energy \u221a s approximately like s 0.15 , stronger than in pp (s 0.11 ). Somewhat surprising is the fact that the centrality dependence is practically identical to Au-Au at RHIC (at least for N part > 50), despite the fact that impact parameter dependent shadowing/saturation could be expected to be much stronger at LHC (much smaller Feynman-x). Saturation physics gives a natural explanation for both observations, as the energy dependence is predicted to be a power law with roughly the correct exponent, whereas the centrality dependence changes only weakly (logarithmically) with the saturation scale and therefore the beam energy. Note that the different energy dependence measured for pp and AA collisions requires that the centrality dependence at RHIC and LHC must be slightly different for very peripheral reactions, where particle production (per participant) must converge towards the corresponding pp value.",

Compared to top RHIC energy, the 'volume of homogeneity' increases by a factor two and the system lifetime increases by more than 30%, pretty much in line with predictions from hydrodynamics. Also a more detailed study of the out/long/side radii as a function of pair momentum shows very good agreement with hydro models, at least with those that also describe well the RHIC data. While both pp and AA radii scale with the charged particle multiplicity to some power (close to 1/3), the scaling coefficient and the offset are different leading to different radii for the same final state multiplicity (i.e. very high multiplicity pp and peripheral AA). Therefore the freeze-out is not governed solely by a universal final state particle density, as has been sometimes advocated at lower energies, but the initial geometrical size of the colliding particles plays a role as well.",

The spectral slopes change significantly compared to RHIC, most dramatically for protons, indicating a much stronger radial flow. A first attempt at a blast wave fit indicates that the average radial flow velocity reaches about 2/3 of the speed of light and that the kinetic freeze-out temperature drops below 100 MeV. While the K/\u03c0 ratio increases slightly with centrality from the corresponding value in pp, the p/\u03c0 ratio stays at the pp value of about 0.05; a value which is smaller by a factor 1.5-2 than the one predicted by thermal models of particle production assuming the canonical chemical freeze-out conditions expected at LHC (T \u2248 165 MeV, \u00b5 B \u2248 0, \u03b3 S = 1).

Triangular flow also most naturally and economically explains the unusual structures seen already at RHIC in two-particle correlations (often called 'Mach Cone' and 'Soft Long-Range Ridge') as an interference between various flow components, chiefly v 2 and v 3 . Identified particle elliptic flow at LHC shows a stronger dependence on particle mass than at RHIC, with light (pions) and heavy (protons) particles pushed further apart from each other -as expected from hydro because of the increased radial flow. This measurement also seems to indicate that the 'quark number scaling' of v 2 observed at RHIC is most likely accidental at low momenta (< 2 GeV/c); at LHC scaling with particle mass as predicted by 'particle hydro' describes the data actually better. However, at higher p T , quark number scaling continues to hold for v 2 (as well as v 3 ) and therefore a coalescence type mechanism may still be needed to describe flow in the intermediate momentum region.",

            "text": "The very first measurement of high p T suppression has shown that R AA , the properly normalized ratio of p T spectra in Pb-Pb and pp, shows a pronounced minimum around 5-7 GeV/c which is slightly deeper than at RHIC, but then rises significantly towards 20 GeV/c. The new results extend the p T range towards 100 GeV/c and make use of the measured pp comparison spectrum at 2.76 TeV (because of limited statistics, the reference spectrum still needs to be extrapolated above 30 GeV/c). The rise in R AA is seen to continue up to the highest p T , with a gradual change in slope above 30-40 GeV/c. The centrality dependence of R AA becomes less pronounced at progressively higher momenta. The suppression for identified particles (K 0 S and \u039b) becomes independent of particle type above 8 GeV/c but is different below, where the kaon R AA is rather close to the one for inclusive charged particles, whereas the \u039b R AA is larger and reaches unity at around 2-3 GeV/c (presumably a reflection of the 'baryon anomaly' mentioned earlier). The yield I AA of particles associated to a high p T trigger particle (normalized to the yield from pp) is compatible with unity for peripheral collisions for both near-side and away-side associated particles. For central collisions, the away-side yield shows the suppression expected from in-medium energy loss (I AA \u2248 0.5\u22120.6), similar in magnitude to RHIC, whereas the near-side is slightly but significantly enhanced (I AA \u2248 1.2). This could indicate some modification also of the near-side jet at LHC.",

In all cases, the total and differential cross-sections in pp (2.76 and 7 TeV) are at the upper edge of, but fully consistent with, perturbative QCD calculations (FONLL) and also consistent with the results from the other three LHC experiments in regions where the phase space coverage overlaps. They can therefore be used with confidence as a basis to construct the reference data for the Pb-Pb results. The suppression of prompt (i.e. B feed-down corrected) charmed mesons has been measured in the p T range 2-12 GeV/c. Above 5-6 GeV/c, the charm meson R AA (\u2248 0.2) is compatible within statistical and systematic errors with the R AA of charged pions, whereas it may be somewhat larger at lower momenta. The R AA of heavy flavour electrons and inclusive muons (which contain a mix of c and b decays) show a suppression in central collisions which is consistent with each other but larger than the R AA of prompt charm. Such a feature is present in models where the energy loss for charm is larger than for beauty.",

            "text": "The picture which emerges at LHC is that already hinted at at RHIC: Quenching of charm quarks is essentially as strong as that of inclusive hadrons, at least for p T above 5-6 GeV/c. Qualitatively, a difference between the R AA of heavy quarks and pions is expected as the energy loss of massive quarks should be smaller than that of massless gluons (the dominant source of pions at LHC) because of colour charge and the 'dead cone' effect. A quantitative comparison with models will be required to see if the predicted size of the effect is compatible with our data. J/\u03c8 production, the classical deconfinement signal, has confounded expectations and interpretations ever since the first nuclear suppression, measured with Oxygen beams at the SPS, was announced at the Quark Matter conference in 1987. The puzzling fact that J/\u03c8 suppression is rather similar in magnitude at SPS and RHIC may indicate that either the J/\u03c8 is not suppressed at all and we see only \u03c8' and \u03c7 c suppression at both SPS and RHIC, or that J/\u03c8 suppression is more or less balanced by enhanced production via coalescence of two independently produced charm quarks. A resolution to this puzzle may come from measuring J/\u03c8 production at LHC (where coalescence effects should be stronger because of the abundant charm production) and by comparing the suppression patterns of the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 families.",

Using the measured pp cross-section at 2.76 TeV as comparison, the J/\u03c8 R AA is measured in the forward muon spectrometer to be about 0.5, with very little centrality dependence. This value is about a factor 2 larger than that measured by PHENIX with muons in the forward region; the difference is less but still significant when comparing with PHENIX electrons at midrapidity. The suppression is also significantly less than that reported by ATLAS. However, the ATLAS results are for high p T and closer to midrapidity, which would indicate that the suppression either increases with transverse momentum or decreases with rapidity.",

            "text": "While these results are very intriguing, there are still a number of unknowns to be clarified before any firm conclusions can be drawn concerning J/\u03c8 production at LHC. Besides a small correction for feed-down from B mesons (\u2248 10%), the influence of shadowing/saturation effects on nuclear structure functions must be taken into account, as well as 'cold matter' absorption which may (or may not) be important at the LHC energy. For this reason a p-Pb run, which will address these nuclear effects, will be needed and is under discussion for 2013.",

With a wealth of results barely 6 months after the first collisions, the LHC heavy ion program has benefited from the (too) many years of meticulous R&D and preparation, a one year 'running in' with proton beams, and, last but not least, a decade of experience and progress made at RHIC. In most results we see a smooth evolution from RHIC to LHC, qualitatively similar but quantitatively different; a sign both that the field is mature enough to be predictable and that the initial conditions (e.g. the energy density) are sufficiently different at both machines so that comparing the results and model predictions will tell us more about the properties of the QGP than looking at either facility alone. With the first low luminosity run, we have just started to explore the 'terra incognita' where the energy reach of LHC makes it unique (e.g. low-x physics, hard processes), and with its very strong and complementary set of detectors we can look forward to many more exciting conferences where quarks (and gluons) matter.",
