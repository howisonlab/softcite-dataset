The Tevatron is scheduled to continue running until the end of 2010 and each experiment is expected to collect 8-9 fb -1 total. An additional year of running in 2011 is being considered and would add approximately another 2 fb -1 of data to each experiment.

It is unique among the quarks because it is so heavy, weighing about as much as a gold atom. A consequence of this heavy mass is that the top quark decays before it hadronizes so that we have an opportunity to study the properties of a bare quark. Many of the measurements described below have no analog among studies done of the other quarks. The Tevatron experiments are pioneering a full program of measurements to explore all aspects of top-quark physics.",

            "text": "The top quark is produced at the Tevatron either in top+anti-top (ttbar) pairs via the strong interaction, or singly (tq) via the electroweak interaction \uf085 . The top quark decays to a W boson plus a b quark with a branching fraction of ~100%. The final state decays of top quark events are thus determined by the decay of the W bosons. For ttbar events there are three main decay final states: the dilepton (DIL) in which both W bosons decay to leptons, the lepton-plus-jets (LJT) in which one of the W bosons decays to leptons and the other to hadrons, and the all-jets (AJT) in which both W bosons decay to hadrons. The experimental signatures are for the DIL channel two energetic leptons, missing energy from the neutrinos, and two b-jets from the topquark decay, for the LJT channel one energetic lepton, missing energy, two jets from the hadronic W decay, and 2 b-jets from the top-quark decay, and for the AJT channel, six jets, two of which are b-jets from the top-quark decay. For tq events we only make use of the leptonic W decays due to an overwhelming background in the fully hadronic final state. The experimental signature is one energetic lepton, missing energy, one b-jet from the top-quark decay, and an additional jet from the \"q\" quark. In all cases the experimental signature includes at least one b-jet. Identifying jets that originated from a b-quark is important in suppressing the backgrounds. Both experiments rely on precision vertex information from silicon micro-strip detectors to identify b-jets on a jet-by-jet basis.",

The dominant backgrounds arise from W bosons produced in association with jets (W+jets) some of which are heavy flavor jets from b and c quarks (W+hf), and from multi-jet QCD processes. For DIL and tq analyses background contributions from Drell-Yan processes, and diboson production -WW, W\u03b3, WZ, etc -are also important. In general these background processes have fewer jets, almost no b-jets, and are less energetic relative to top quark events.",

An older combination is also available from D\u00d8 [5]. Both are in agreement with Standard Model (SM) predictions [6]. The relative uncertainty from the experiments is about 9%, comparable to the relative uncertainty on the predictions of about 10% (dominated by PDF and factorization/renormalization scale uncertainties). The experimental determination is systematics limited, dominated by uncertainties associated with the b-jet identification efficiency, the luminosity, and the normalization of the W+hf backgrounds. CDF eliminated the luminosity uncertainty by measuring the ttbar cross section relative to the inclusive Z cross section [7] which reduced the relative uncertainty to 8%. Barring breakthroughs in the Monte Carlo modeling of the W+hf backgrounds or in the analysis methodology, it will be difficult to significantly improve the precision of these results.",

A FB pp (CDF) = (19.3 \u00b1 6.5(sta) \u00b1 2.4(sys) )% after all corrections [9]. This measured value is 2 standard deviations above the SM prediction and is statistics limited. An older result is also available from D\u00d8 [10]. A measurement of the single top production cross section provides a unique model independent determination of the V tb element of the quark mixing matrix. Since the single-top signature is overwhelmed by background sophisticated analysis techniques are necessary. Both D\u00d8 and CDF used multiple analyses each employing a different multivariate discriminate in order to improve the signal-to-background ratio and search for tq production. Each multivariate technique takes as input several variables, each of which offer some mild signal discrimination, and exploits correlations in the multidimensional space of these variables to construct a single output variable with better signal discrimination. Both experiments rigorously validate the modeling of the input variables as well as the resulting output discriminate using background dominated data control samples. The analyses were conducted blind and only after the background estimates and a full set of systematic uncertainties had been evaluated did the experiments \"open the box\". The results are summarized in Fig. 1. Each multivariate technique observed an excess of events above background and measured a tq cross section, assuming the SM ratio of s-channel to t-channel production, consistent with each other. CDF and D\u00d8 each combined their full set of multivariate analyses to yield the best sensitivity and both reported 5\u03c3 observation of electroweak production of single top quarks in March 2009 [11] [12]. From their measured cross section and assuming a top-quark mass of 175 (170) GeV/c 2 , CDF (D\u00d8) determines ! V tb = 0.91\u00b1 0.13 (1.07 \u00b1 0.12) , where the uncertainty includes all sources of experimental and theory uncertainty.

Since the branching fractions of the charged higgs are different from a W boson, these decays would change the ratio of cross sections measured in each ttbar channel (LJT:DIL:AJT). No evidence of charged higgs decay was found and limits are set in the (M H+ , tan\u03b2) plane [5]. Alternatively, there are NP signatures that would mimic the ttbar signature and could be hiding in the top-quark samples.
