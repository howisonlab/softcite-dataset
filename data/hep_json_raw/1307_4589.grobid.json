The discovery of a particle with a mass of 125 GeV compatible with a Higgs boson by the AT-LAS and CMS experiments [4,5] leads to new questions -in particular whether it is the SM Higgs boson or one of typically many Higgs bosons predicted by extensions of the Standard Model. Experimentally, this implies measuring the properties of the new boson (not covered here) and searching for additional Higgs bosons. In the following an overview of the most recent results of searches for BSM Higgs bosons using an integrated luminosity of at least 5 fb \u22121 is presented.",

The \u03c4 had +jets channel is the most sensitive one for most of the H + mass range. The selection starts with a \u03c4 + E miss T trigger and requires the presence of exactly one hadronically decaying tau lepton, at least four jets (at least one of them b-tagged), no electrons or muons, E miss T > 65 GeV, a high significance of the missing transverse energy (quantified by its ratio to the square root of the sum of transverse momenta of reconstructed tracks) and a topology consistent with the presence of a hadronic top quark decay. The final discriminant used is a transverse mass built from the visible tau lepton decay products and the missing momentum vector. All backgrounds are estimated in a data-driven way by replacing muons in \u00b5+jets collision data with simulated tau leptons for backgrounds with actual \u03c4 leptons, and by deriving data-driven corrections for the misidentification probabilities for backgrounds where jets or electrons are misidentified as \u03c4 leptons.",

In a different approach, lepton universality in tt events is tested by observing the ratio of event yields with electrons or muons and with and without tau leptons in the final state which would be enhanced by the presence of a charged Higgs boson [9].
