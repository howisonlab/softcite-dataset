These hyperons are reconstructed via the detection of their charged weak-decay products, which are identified through their measured ionisation losses and momenta in the ALICE Time Projection Chamber. Comparing the production yields in Pb-Pb and pp collisions, a strangeness enhancement has been measured and found to increase with the centrality of the collision and with the strangeness content of the baryon; moreover, in the comparison with similar measurements at lower energies, it decreases as the centre-of-mass energy increases, following the trend already observed moving from SPS to RHIC. Recent measurement of cascade and \u03a9 in p-Pb interactions are compared with results in Pb-Pb and pp collisions and with predictions from thermal models, based on a grand canonical approach. The nuclear modification factors for the charged \u039e and \u03a9, compared to the ones for the lighter particles, are also presented.",

In pp collisions, the production of strange particles is limited by the local canonical strangeness conservation. This is not the case in central heavy-ion collisions, where strange quarks are expected to be produced more abundantly, resulting in an enhanced production of strange baryons at the end of the hadronisation stage. Strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions with respect to pp (p-Be) has been observed in Pb-Pb collisions at the NA57 experiment [2], at STAR [3] in Au-Au collisions, and indeed confirmed by ALICE in central 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions [4].",

These ratios are shown in Figure 1c as a function of N part , both at LHC and RHIC energies. The relative production of strangeness in pp collisions at the LHC is larger than at RHIC energy while it is almost the same at the two energies for A-A collisions. The decrease of enhancement with increasing energy is caused by the change in pp collisions, in agreement with the hypothesis of progressive removal of canonical suppression in pp collisions with increasing energy. The hyperonto-pion ratio increases when going from pp to A-A, showing a relative enhancement of strangeness  production in A-A collisions (normalized to the pion yield) which is about half of that seen when normalizing to the mean number of participants. The enhancement rises with centrality up to about N part \u223c 150 and apparently saturates thereafter. Figure 2 shows the recently measured p-Pb hyperon-to-pion ratios as a function of the chargedparticle density, compared with results from pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The multiplicity in p-Pb collisions is intermediate between pp and Pb-Pb. An enhancement of the multi-strange baryons with multiplicity in p-Pb data is observed; it still increases with the strangeness content of the baryon, also considering the earlier 2\u039b/(\u03c0 \u2212 +\u03c0 + ) ratios published in [8].",

A strangeness enhancement has been observed in the Pb-Pb collisions with characteristics similar to the ones already observed at lower energies; the decreasing trend with the increasing of the centre-of-mass energy has been confirmed. The hyperon-to-pion ratios measured in p-Pb collisions bridge the values in pp to those in Pb-Pb and reveal a dependency of the strangeness enhancement on the charged particle multiplicity. The comparison to the grand canonical thermal model expectations in Pb-Pb collisions for T = 155 MeV, gives, within a general agreement with the measurements in Pb-Pb collisions, a tension between ratios for \u039e and \u03a9 in p-Pb collisions: while \u03a9/\u03c0 only approaches the saturation level with increasing multiplicity, the \u039e/\u03c0 values at high multiplicity are comparable to the Pb-Pb values and lie above the equilibrium limits. Finally, the R AA shows a large suppression with similar values for all the species at p T > 6 GeV/c, presence of mass ordering at intermediate p T and a clear strangeness enhancement effect especially for the \u03a9 .",
