            "text": "Flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes are rare within the Standard Model (SM) as they cannot occur at tree level. At the loop level, they are suppressed by the GIM mechanism [1] but are nevertheless well established in B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays with branching fractions of the order 10 \u22127 and 10 \u22128 , respectively [2,3]. In contrast to the B meson system, where the very high mass of the top quark in the loop weakens the suppression, the GIM cancellation is almost exact in D meson decays leading to expected branching fractions for c \u2192 u\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 processes in the (1-3) \u00d7 10 \u22129 range [4][5][6]. This suppression provides a unique opportunity to search for FCNC D meson decays and to probe the coupling of up-type quarks in electroweak processes, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), (b).",

The combined tracking system has momentum (p) resolution p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). The IP is defined as the perpendicular distance between the path of a charged track and the primary pp interaction vertex (PV) of the event. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [15]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger [16] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage that applies a full event reconstruction. It exploits the finite lifetime and relatively large mass of charm and beauty hadrons to distinguish heavy flavour decays from the dominant light quark processes.",

For the D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc + search, the bins of m(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + ) improve the statistical significance of any signal observed, as it is assumed that a Majorana neutrino would only appear in one subsample. The definitions of these subsamples are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Cross-feed between the bins is found to be negligible from simulation studies. The D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc + data are fitted independently, with the D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 sample being fitted in two parts due to the requirement of some of the software triggers that m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) exceeds 1.0 GeV/c 2 . A D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 fit excluding these trigger lines simultaneously fits the low-m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ), \u03b7, \u03c1/\u03c9 and \u03c6 bins. Another fit to the D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 data, including these trigger lines, is applied to the high-m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) and \u03c6 bins. The \u03c6 bin is needed as it provides a signal shape and normalises any signal yield. A simultaneous fit to the D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc + data is done in all four m(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + ) bins. The \u03c6 bin from the D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 data is again used to provide a signal shape and to normalise any signal yield.
