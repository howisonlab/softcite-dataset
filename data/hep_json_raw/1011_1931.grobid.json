The search is performed in the three-b-quark channel using multijet-triggered events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 fb \u22121 . In the absence of any significant excess above background, limits are set on the cross section multiplied by the branching ratio in the Higgs boson mass range 90 to 300 GeV, extending the excluded regions in the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The two Higgs boson doublets in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [1] lead to five physical Higgs bosons: three neutral (collectively denoted as \u03c6): h, H, and A; and two charged: H + and H \u2212 . Two parameters, conventionally chosen as the ratio of the two Higgs doublet vacuum expectation values, tan \u03b2, and the mass of the pseudoscalar A, M A , are sufficient to describe the MSSM Higgs sector at tree level.

Therefore, in these cases the production of Higgs bosons associated with bottom quarks (down-type quarks with the highest mass) is enhanced by a factor of 2 \u00d7 tan 2 \u03b2 compared to SM production. Due to the tan \u03b2 enhancement, the main decay for the three neutral Higgs bosons is \u03c6 \u2192 bb with branching ratios near 90% (the remainder being mostly \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ). Since a direct search for \u03c6 \u2192 bb is difficult due to large multijet backgrounds, searches rely on the case where \u03c6 is produced in association with one b quark. The final state with three b quarks represents a powerful search channel, with the third b-jet providing additional suppression of the large multijet background at a hadron collider. MSSM Higgs boson production has been studied at the CERN LEP e + e \u2212 collider which excluded M h,A < 93 GeV for all tan \u03b2 values [4]. The CDF [5] and D0 [6][7][8] collaborations have extended MSSM Higgs boson searches to higher masses for high tan \u03b2 values. This Letter uses data collected during Run II at the Fermilab Tevatron collider by the D0 collaboration corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 fb \u22121 [9]. The dataset is broken into two periods, corresponding to the period before (1.0 fb \u22121 ) and after (4.2 fb \u22121 ) the upgrade of the D0 silicon vertex detector and trigger system. The dataset is five times larger than that used in the previous publication [7]. The full dataset has been reanalyzed to incorporate recent improvements to analysis procedures, algorithms, and calibrations. Improved modeling of the background has resulted in reduced systematic uncertainties. In addition, the Higgs boson mass range under consideration has been extended to 300 GeV. The limits are calculated using a program [10], which is an implementation of the modified frequentist limit setting procedure [24], and are based only on the shape, and not the normalisation, of the distribution of the final discriminating variable. The D0 detector is described in Ref. [11]. Dedicated triggers for the three trigger levels (L1, L2, L3) designed to select events with at least three jets are used in this analysis. The majority of the data were recorded with b-tagging requirements at the trigger level, either at L3 or at both L2 and L3. The trigger has an efficiency of approximately 60% for \u03c6b \u2192 bbb events with a Higgs boson mass of 150 GeV when measured relative to events with three or four reconstructed jets.",

Details of the jet reconstruction and energy scale determination are described in Ref. [13]. In addition to passing a set of quality criteria, all jets are required to be matched to at least two tracks reconstructed in the central detector, pointing to the pp vertex and with hits in the silicon detector. The matching criterion is \u2206R(track, jetaxis) = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03d5) 2 < 0.5, where \u03b7 is the pseudo-rapidity. Signal events are selected by requiring three or four jets with transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The distance in the coordinate along the beam axis of the position of the pp vertex (z P V ) is required to be within 35 cm of the center of the detector. This is well within the geometric acceptance of the silicon detector, as needed for efficient b-tagging. A neural network (NN) b-tagging algorithm [14], which considers lifetime based information involving the track impact parameters and secondary vertices, is used to identify b-quark jets. Each event must have at least three jets satisfying a b-tag NN requirement. The single jet b-tagging efficiency is approximately 50% for a light-quark jet mistag rate of 0.8%. Data events with two tagged jets are used together with simulated events with two and three tagged jets to model the background. Finally, the transverse momenta of the two b-tagged jets with the highest p T are required to be above 25 GeV. The data are split into four independent channels based on jet multiplicity (three or four jets) and running period.",

The cross section [17], experimental acceptance, and the kinematic distributions of the b-quark jet produced in association with the Higgs boson are corrected to next-to-leading order (NLO) using mcfm [16]. Multijet background events from the bbj, bbjj, ccj, ccjj, bbcc, and bbbb processes, where j denotes a light parton (u, d, s quark or gluon), are generated with the alpgen [18] event generator. A matching algorithm is used to avoid double counting of final states [19]. The small contribution from tt production to the background is also simulated with alpgen. Other processes, such as Zbb and single top quark production, are negligible. The alpgen samples are processed through pythia for showering and hadronization. All samples are then processed through a geant-based [20] simulation of the D0 detector. The same reconstruction algorithms are used for the simulated samples as for the data. A parameterized trigger simulation, based on efficiencies measured in data, is used to model the effects of the trigger requirements. The b-tagging is modeled by weighting simulated events based on their tagging probability measured using data [14]. The efficiency of the requirements on the triggers, z P V , and the number of jets, range from 1.9% to 26.4% for Higgs boson masses between 90 and 300 GeV. After the three b-tag requirement the efficiency with respect to the total number of signal events ranges from 0.2% to 1.4% in the three-jet channel (0.1% to 0.9% in the four-jet channel). Table I shows the number of events in data and the signal efficiency at different stages of the event selection.",

The uncertainty from the b-tagging of jets is evaluated by varying the b-tag efficiencies within their uncertainties.

The shape difference between triple and double b-tagged data in the trigger turn-on curves resulting from the b-tagging criteria in the trigger is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty.

The overall normalisation of the background expectation is allowed to float independently in the null (background-only) and test (background-plus-signal) hypotheses. The systematic uncertainties on the signal and background are included in the limit setting procedure. Each component of systematic uncertainty is adjusted by introducing multiplicative scale factors and maximizing the likelihood for the agreement between prediction and data with respect to these scale factors, constrained by prior Gaussian uncertainties. Limits on the product of cross section and branching ratio are obtained by scaling the signal cross section until 1 \u2212 CL s = 0.95 is reached.

To take this effect into account, the width of the Higgs boson is calculated with feynhiggs [26] and included in the simulation as a function of the mass and tan \u03b2 by convoluting a relativistic Breit-Wigner function with the NLO cross section. The masses and couplings of the Higgs bosons in the MSSM depend, in addition to tan \u03b2 and M A , on the SUSY parameters through radiative corrections. Limits on tan \u03b2 as a function of M A are derived for two particular scenarios assuming a CP-conserving Higgs sector [27]: the m max h [28] and no-mixing [29] scenarios with a negative or positive value of the Higgs sector bilinear coupling, \u00b5. Figure 6 shows the result interpreted for these two scenarios in the case of \u00b5 = \u2212200 GeV. Weaker limits are obtained for the \u00b5 > 0 scenarios, due to the decrease in the product of cross section and branching ratio for positive values of \u00b5 [27].",
