This selection enables MINOS to establish each event as a CC \u03bd \u00b5 interaction by identifying the outgoing \u00b5 \u2212 . We focused on CC events to maximize the \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance signal. There are a total of 2,463 CC events in this analysis.

The statistically significant fit to a constant rate implies there are no sidereal modulations in the data sample.",

The results of the FFT analysis are given in Table 1. In Rebel and Mufson 4 we determine the statistical significance of the harmonic powers in Table 1 by simulation. We find that 3.45 is the 99.7% confidence level (C.L.) for the probability that a measured quadratic sum of powers for any harmonic was not drawn from a distribution having a sidereal signal. Since none of the harmonic powers exceed our 99.7%(FFT) detection threshold, we conclude that there is no evidence for a sidereal modulation resulting from mixing between neutrinos and antineutrinos as predicted by Eq. (2) in this neutrino data set. We investigated the sensitivity of our results to several sources of systematic uncertainties. We found that systematics were unimportant.",
