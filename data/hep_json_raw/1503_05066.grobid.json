The analysis uses 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the H \u2192 bb decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by tt+jets production. In the single-lepton channel, variables calculated using a matrix element method are included as inputs to the neural network to improve discrimination of the irreducible tt+bb background. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) limit of 3.4 (2.2) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained at 95 % confidence level. The ratio of the measured tt H signal cross section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be \u03bc = 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV .",

            "text": "The discovery of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model (SM) [1-3] Higgs boson [4][5][6][7] at the LHC was reported by the ATLAS [8] and CMS [9] collaborations in July 2012. There is by now clear evidence of this particle in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , H \u2192 Z Z ( * ) \u2192 4 , H \u2192 W W ( * ) \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay channels, at a mass of around 125 GeV , which have strengthened the SM Higgs boson hypothesis [10][11][12][13][14][15] of the observation. To determine all properties of the new boson experimentally, it is important to study it in as many production and decay modes as possible. In particular, its coupling to heavy quarks is a strong focus of current experimental searches. The SM Higgs boson production in e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch association with a top-quark pair (tt H) [16][17][18][19] with subsequent Higgs decay into bottom quarks (H \u2192 bb) addresses heavy-quark couplings in both production and decay. Due to the large measured mass of the top quark, the Yukawa coupling of the top quark (y t ) is much stronger than that of other quarks. The observation of the tt H production mode would allow for a direct measurement of this coupling, to which other Higgs production modes are only sensitive through loop effects. Since y t is expected to be close to unity, it is also argued to be the quantity that might give insight into the scale of new physics [20].",

In the single-lepton channel, where such background is significant, an \u03b7-dependent isolation cut is made, based on the sum of transverse energies of cells around the direction of each candidate, in a cone of size R = ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 = 0.2.

The longitudinal impact parameter of the electron track with respect to the selected event primary vertex defined in Sect. 4, z 0 , is required to be less than 2 mm. To increase efficiency in the dilepton channel, the electron selection is optimised by using an improved electron identification method based on a likelihood variable [27] and the electron isolation. The ratio of p cone30 T to the p T of the electron is required to be less than 0.12, i.e. p cone30 T / p e T < 0.12. The optimised selection improves the efficiency by roughly 7 % per electron.",

The final muon candidates are refitted using the complete track information from both detector systems, and are required to satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.5. Additionally, muons are required to be separated by R > 0.4 from any selected jet (see below for details on jet reconstruction and selection). Furthermore, muons must satisfy a p T -dependent track-based isolation requirement that has good performance under conditions with a high number of jets from other pp interactions within the same bunch crossing, known as \"pileup\", or in boosted configurations where the muon is close to a jet: the track p T scalar sum in a cone of variable size R < 10 GeV / p T \u03bc around the muon must be less than 5 % of the muon p T . The longitudinal impact parameter of the muon track with respect to the primary vertex, z 0 , is required to be less than 2 mm. Jets are reconstructed from calibrated clusters [25,29] built from energy deposits in the calorimeters, using the antik t algorithm [30][31][32] with a radius parameter R = 0.4. Prior to jet finding, a local cluster calibration scheme [33,34] is applied to correct the cluster energies for the effects of dead material, non-compensation and out-of-cluster leakage. The jets are calibrated using energy-and \u03b7-dependent calibration factors, derived from simulations, to the mean energy of stable particles inside the jets. Additional corrections to account for the difference between simulation and data are applied [35]. After energy calibration, jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To reduce the contamination from lowp T jets due to pileup, the scalar sum of the p T of tracks matched to the jet and originating from the primary vertex must be at least 50 % of the scalar sum of the p T of all tracks matched to the jet. This is referred to as the jet vertex fraction. This criterion is only applied to jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

In particular, the following categories are considered: if two particle jets are both matched to an extra b-quark or extra c-quark each, the event is referred to as tt+bb or tt+cc; if a single particle jet is matched to a single b(c)-quark the event is referred to as tt+b (tt+c); if a single particle jet is matched to a bb or a cc pair, the event is referred to as tt+B or tt+C, respectively. Figure 4 shows the relative contributions of the different tt+bb event categories to the total tt+bb cross section at generator level for the Powheg+Pythia, Mad-graph+Pythia and SherpaOL samples. It demonstrates that Powheg+Pythia is able to reproduce reasonably well the tt+HF content of the Madgraph tt+jets sample, which includes a LO tt+bb matrix element calculation, as well as the NLO SherpaOL prediction.",

It was verified using the simulation that the ratio derived at \u221a s = 7 TeV is applicable to \u221a s = 8 TeV simulation. It is not applied to the tt+bb component since that component was corrected to match the best available theory calculation. Moreover, the measured differential cross section is not sensitive to this component. The reweighting significantly improves the agreement between simulation and data in the total number of jets (primarily due to the tt system p T reweighting) and jet p T (primarily due to the top quark p T reweighting). This can be seen in Fig. 5, where the number of jets and the scalar sum of the jet p T (H T had ) distributions in the exclusive 2-btag region are plotted in the single-lepton channel before and after the reweighting is applied.",

This can negatively affect the sensitivity of the analysis through the large statistical uncertainties on the templates and unreliable systematic uncertainties due to shape fluctuations. In order to mitigate this problem, instead of tagging the jets by applying the b-tagging algorithm, their probabilities to be b-tagged are parameterised as functions of jet flavour, p T , and \u03b7. This allows all events in the sample before b-tagging is applied to be used in predicting the normalisation and shape after b-tagging [91]. The tagging probabilities are derived using an inclusive tt+jets simulated sample.

The signal, normalised to the SM prediction, is shown both as a filled red area stacked on the backgrounds and separately as a dashed red line. The hashed area corresponds to the total uncertainty on the yields from top quark decay is slightly higher than that of a b-jet with the same p T and \u03b7 but arising from other sources, they are derived separately.

Those include (5j, \u2265 4b), (\u2265 6j, 3b) and (\u2265 6j, \u2265 4b) in the case of the single-lepton channel, and (\u2265 4j, 3b) and (\u2265 4j, \u2265 4b) in the case of the dilepton channel.

Due to the complexity and high dimensionality, adaptive MC techniques [104], simplifications and approximations are needed to obtain results within a reasonable computing time. In particular, only the numerically most significant contributing helicity states of a process hypothesis for a given event, identified at the start of each integration, are evaluated. This does not perceptibly decrease the separation power but reduces the calculation time by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, several approximations are made to improve the VEGAS convergence rate. Firstly, the dimensionality of integration is reduced by assuming that the final-state object directions in \u03b7 and \u03c6 as well as charged lepton momenta are well measured, and therefore the corresponding transfer functions are represented by \u03b4 functions. The total momentum conservation and a negligible transverse momentum of the initial-state partons allow for further reduction. Secondly, kinematic transformations are utilised to optimise the integration over the remaining phase space by aligning the peaks of the integrand with the integration dimensions. The narrow- width approximation is applied to the leptonically decaying W boson. This leaves three b-quark energies, one light-quark energy, the hadronically decaying W boson mass and the invariant mass of the two b-quarks originating from either the Higgs boson for the signal or a gluon for the background as the remaining parameters which define the integration phase space. The total integration volume is restricted based upon the observed values and the width of the transfer functions and of the propagator peaks in the matrix elements. Finally, the likelihood contributions of all allowed assignment permutations are coarsely integrated, and only for the leading twelve assignment permutations is the full integration performed, with a required precision decreasing according to their relative contributions.",

Hence no coupling of the Higgs boson to the W boson is accounted for in |M i | 2 to allow for a consistent treatment when performing the kinematic transformation. The Higgs boson is required to decay into a pair of bquarks, while the top-quark pair decays into the single-lepton channel. For the background hypothesis, only the diagrams of the irreducible tt+bb background are considered. Since it dominates the most signal-rich analysis regions, inclusion of other processes does not improve the separation between signal and background. No gluon radiation from the finalstate quarks is allowed, since these are kinematically suppressed and difficult to treat in any kinematic transformation aiming for phase-space alignment during the integration process. In the definition of the signal and background hypothesis the LO diagrams are required to have a top-quark pair as an intermediate state resulting in exactly four b-quarks, two light quarks, one charged lepton (electron or muon) and one neutrino in the final state. Assuming lepton universality and invariance under charge conjugation, diagrams of only one lepton flavour and of only negative charge (electron) are considered. The probability density function calculation of the signal and background is only performed in the (\u2265 6j, 3b) and (\u2265 6j, \u2265 4b) regions of the single-lepton channel. Only six reconstructed jets are considered in the calculation: the four jets with the highest value of the probability to be a b-jet returned by the b-tagging algorithm (i.e. the highest btagging weight) and two of the remaining jets with an invariant mass closest to the W boson mass of 80.4 GeV. If a jet is btagged it cannot be assigned to a light quark in the matrix element description. In the case of more than four b-tagged jets, only the four with the highest b-tagging weight are treated as b-tagged. Assignment permutations between the two light quarks of the hadronically decaying W boson and between the two b-quarks originating from the Higgs boson or gluon result in the same likelihood value and are thus not considered. As a result there are in total 12 and 36 assignment permutations in the (\u2265 6j, \u2265 4b) and (\u2265 6j, 3b) region, respectively, which need to be evaluated in the coarse integration phase.",

The statistical analysis is based on a binned likelihood function L(\u03bc, \u03b8 ) constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins considered in the analysis. The likelihood function depends on the signal-strength parameter \u03bc, defined as the ratio of the observed/expected cross section to the SM cross section, and \u03b8 , denoting the set of nuisance parameters that encode the effects of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background expectations. They are implemented in the likelihood function as Gaussian or log-normal priors. Therefore, the total number of expected events in a given bin depends on \u03bc and \u03b8 . The nuisance parameters \u03b8 adjust the expectations for signal and background according to the corresponding sys-tematic uncertainties, and their fitted values correspond to the amount that best fits the data. This procedure allows the impact of systematic uncertainties on the search sensitivity to be reduced by taking advantage of the highly populated background-dominated control regions included in the likelihood fit. It requires a good understanding of the systematic effects affecting the shapes of the discriminant distributions. The test statistic q \u03bc is defined as the profile likelihood ratio: q \u03bc = \u22122 ln(L(\u03bc,\u03b8 \u03bc )/L(\u03bc,\u03b8)), where\u03bc and\u03b8 are the values of the parameters that maximise the likelihood function (with the constraints 0 \u2264\u03bc \u2264 \u03bc), and\u03b8 \u03bc are the values of the nuisance parameters that maximise the likelihood function for a given value of \u03bc.

A signal 3.4 times larger than predicted by the SM is excluded at 95 % CL using the CL s method. A signal 2.2 times larger than for the SM Higgs boson is expected to be excluded in the case of no SM Higgs boson, and 3.1 times larger in the case of a SM Higgs boson. This is also summarised in Table 5.  The predicted background is obtained from the global signal-plusbackground fit. The tt H signal is shown both for the best fit value (\u03bc = 1.5) and for the upper limit at 95 % CL (\u03bc = 3.4) Figure 18 summarises post-fit event yields as a function of log 10 (S/B), for all bins of the distributions used in the combined fit of the single-lepton and dilepton channels. The value of log 10 (S/B) is calculated according to the post-fit yields in each bin of the fitted distributions, either H T had , H T , or NN. The total number of background and signal events is displayed in bins of log 10 (S/B). In particular, the last bin of Fig. 18 includes the two last bins from the most signal-rich region of the NN distribution in (\u2265 6j, \u2265 4b) and the two last bins from the most signalrich region of the NN in (\u2265 4j, \u2265 4b) from the fit. The signal is normalised to the fitted value of the signal strength (\u03bc = 1.5) and the background is obtained from the global fit. A signal strength 3.4 times larger than predicted by the SM, which is excluded at 95 % CL by this analysis, is also shown. Figure 19 demonstrates the effect of various systematic uncertainties on the fitted value of \u03bc and the constraints provided by the data. The post-fit effect on \u03bc is calculated by fixing the corresponding nuisance parameter at\u03b8 \u00b1 \u03c3 \u03b8 , where\u03b8 is the fitted value of the nuisance parameter and \u03c3 \u03b8 is its post-fit uncertainty, and performing the fit again. The difference between the default and the modified \u03bc, \u03bc, represents the effect on \u03bc of this particular systematic uncertainty. The largest effect arises from the uncertainty in normalisation of the irreducible tt+bb background. This uncertainty is reduced by more than one half from the initial 50%. The tt+bb background normalisation is pulled up by about 40 % in the fit, resulting in an increase in the observed tt+bb yield with respect to the Powheg+Pythia prediction. Most of the reduction in uncertainty on the tt+bb normalisation is the result of the significant number of data events in the signal-rich regions dominated by tt+bb background. With no Gaussian prior considered on the tt+bb normalisation, as described in Sect. 8, the fit still prefers an increase in the amount of tt+bb background by about 40 %.",

It was verified that this effect is caused by the interplay between the tt+cc normalisation uncertainty and several other systematic uncertainties affecting the tt+cc background yield.  Fig. 19 The fitted values of the nuisance parameters with the largest impact on the measured signal strength. The points, which are drawn conforming to the scale of the bottom axis, show the deviation of each of the fitted nuisance parameters,\u03b8 , from \u03b8 0 , which is the nominal value of that nuisance parameter, in units of the pre-fit standard deviation \u03b8. The error bars show the post-fit uncertainties, \u03c3 \u03b8 , which are close to 1 if the data do not provide any further constraint on that uncertainty. Conversely, a value of \u03c3 \u03b8 much smaller than 1 indicates a significant reduction with respect to the original uncertainty. The nuisance parameters are sorted according to the post-fit effect of each on \u03bc (hashed blue area) conforming to the scale of the top axis, with those with the largest impact at the top The noticeable effect of the light-jet tagging (mistag) systematic uncertainty is explained by the relatively large fraction of the tt+light background in the signal region with four b-jets in the single-lepton channel. The tt+light events enter the 4-b-tag region through a mistag as opposed to the 3-b-tag region where tagging a c-jet from a W boson decay is more likely.
