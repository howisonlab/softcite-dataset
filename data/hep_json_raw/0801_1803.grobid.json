The size spectrum exhibits a sharp knee at a corresponding primary energy around 4 PeV. This work uses increased statistics and new simulation calculations for the analysis. We performed extensive Monte Carlo calculations and discuss the model dependences involved in the final result assuming interaction models of QGSJET01c and SIBYLL2.1 and primary composition models of heavy dominant (HD) and proton dominant (PD) ones. Pure proton and pure iron primary models are also examined as extreme cases. The detector simulation was also made to improve the accuracy of determining the size of the air showers and the energy of the primary particle. We confirmed that the all-particle energy spectra obtained under various plausible model parameters are not significantly different from each other as expected from the characteristics of the experiment at the high altitude, where the air showers of the primary energy around the knee reaches near maximum development and their features are dominated by electromagnetic components leading to the weak dependence on the interaction model or the primary mass. This is the highest-statistical and the best systematics-controlled measurement covering the widest energy range around the knee energy region.",

            "text": "Although almost 100 years have passed over since the discovery of cosmic rays, their source and acceleration mechanism are still not fully understood. The energy spectrum and chemical composition of cosmic rays can be key information for probing their origin, acceleration mechanism and propagation mechanism. The cosmic-ray spectrum has been observed by many ground-based experiments to resemble two power laws, having a form dj/dE \u221d E \u2212\u03b3 , with \u03b3 = 2.7 below the energy around 4 \u00d7 10 15 eV, and then steepening to \u03b3 = 3.1 above this energy (H\u00f6randel 2003). The change of the power index at this energy is called the spectral \"knee\". Although the existence of the knee has been well established experimentally, there are still controversial arguments on its origin. Proposals for its origin range from astrophysical scenarios like the change of acceleration mechanisms (Berezhko & Ksenofontov 1999;Stanev et al. 1993;Kobayakawa et al. 2002;V\u00f6lk 2004) at the sources of cosmic rays (supernova remnants, pulsars, etc.), the single source assumption (Erlykin & Wolfendale 2005), or effects due to the propagation (Ptuskin et al. 1993;Candia et al. 2002) inside the galaxy (diffusion, drift, escape from the Galaxy) to particle-physics models like the interaction with relic neutrinos (Wigmans 2003) during transport or new processes in the atmosphere (Nikolsky & Romachin) during air-shower development. Common to all models is the prediction of a change of the chemical composition over the knee region. Direct measurements of primary cosmic rays on board balloons or satellites are the best ways for the study of the chemical composition, however, the energy region covered by them with sufficient statistics are limited to 10 14 eV. The energy spectrum and chemical composition of primary cosmic rays around the knee, therefore, has to be studied with ground-based air-shower experiments using surface array and/or detectors for Cerenkov light.",

Although the global features of the all-particle spectrum agree well when we take into account the systematic errors of about 20% involved in the energy scale (H\u00f6randel 2003), there are still serious disagreements in the chemical composition depending on experimental methods, for example, the knee composition obtained by the Tibet and KASCADE experiments can be summarized as follows. We have already reported the energy spectrum of protons and helium in the energy range from 200 TeV to 10,000 TeV (Amenomori et al. 2000;Amenomori et al. 2006a) from air-shower core observation, suggesting a steep power index of ap-proximately -3.1. This indicates that the power index of light component is changed from approximately -2.7 as measured by direct observations to -3.1 around a few hundred TeV. Hence, the light component should become less abundant at the knee and the main component responsible to the structure of the knee must be heavier than helium. Furthermore, the spectral shape of light component seems to keep the power law instead of the exponential cutoff. On the contrary, the KASCADE using electron-muon size analysis (Antoni et al. 2005) claims that the knee in the all-particle spectrum is due to the steepening of the spectra of light elements with exponential type cutoff.",

There is no precise measurement of the chemical composition around the knee region yet and it is in fact impossible to discriminate individual elements clearly by indirect observations. Therefore, most of the works made so far simply discussed the average mass < ln A >. Another approach is the unfolding of the all-particle spectrum using shower characteristics like electron-muon ratio, depth of the shower maximum and so on. In these methods, the detailed information of the allparticle spectrum plays an important role in determining the chemical composition. It is also expected that the specific features of each component like cutoff energy or source characteristics should be reflected in the shape of the all-particle spectrum as discussed in the single source model (Erlykin & Wolfendale 2005). The important features of the all-particle spectrum are the absolute intensity, the position of the knee, the difference of the power index before and after the knee and the sharpness in the size spectrum, which are deeply connected with the acceleration mechanism and the source of cosmic rays.",

It should be also noted that the number of shower particles is dominated by electromagnetic compo-nent with minor contribution of muons, whose interaction model dependence is known to be rather large among current interaction models leading to a large systematic error in the experiments carried out at the sea level because of the large contribution of muons. In other words, the air shower observation at high altitude is sensitive to the most forward region of the hadronic interactions in the center of momentum system (CMS) where high energy secondaries are produced, and the electromagnetic component as a decay product of neutral pions dominate the number of shower particles, while it is insensitive to the central region of the CMS where large number of muons as decay product of charged pions are produced. The differences among current interaction models are mainly related to the central region as seen in the problem of the electron-muon correlation. Hence, the air-shower experiment in Tibet can determine the primary cosmic-ray energy much less dependently upon the chemical composition and the interaction model than experiments at the sea level.",

In this paper, we present an updated all-particle energy spectrum using data set collected in the period from 2000 November through 2004 October. The updates are due to (1) increased statistics by approximately 2.6 times, (2) use of new simulation codes and (3) improvement of the lateral structure function used for the size estimation of air showers. The previous result was obtained using almost the same analysis as used in Tibet I (Amenomori et al. 1996) except for the parameters which depend on the detector configuration. In the present paper, the simulation code Cosmos is replaced by Corsika with interaction models QGSJET01c and SIBYLL2.1, which is now widely used in many analyses by other works and enables the comparison of this work with others easier. The third update on the structure function is made to cover wider energy range than before (see section 4.1.3). Thus, we obtained the all-particle energy spectrum of cosmic rays in a wide range over 3 decades between 10 14 eV and 10 17 eV and the updated result is compared with previous ones.",

Even the most basic quantity like the number of particles arriving to a detector should be 'defined' through MC because we do not measure the number of particles but the charge of PMT-output which is not simply proportional to the number of charged particles entering into the detector if we take into account the contribution of the electromagnetic processes by photons inside the detectors. Another example of the role of MC is to define the effective area of the shower array which should be determined to avoid the erroneous counting of the events whose shower axises are dropping outside of the effective area. Therefore detailed MC calculations are needed on air-shower generation in the atmosphere and on the detector response. Consequently, the final result inevitably depends on the interaction model and on the primary composition model in MC. This is the main source of the systematic errors involved in the air-shower experiment and we try to show them explicitly in the present work.",

The simplest way to bracket all possibilities is to assume pure proton and pure iron primaries. Since it is almost evident that such assumptions are not realistic and lead to unacceptable results showing disagreement with the direct observations, these results will be mentioned as extreme cases. More realistic treatment of the chemical composition is to extrapolate the known composition at low energies measured by direct observations. The uncertainty in extrapolating to the high energy range can be treated by bracketing the reported results on the compo- Table 1: Fractions of the proton(P), helium(He), CNO(M), NaMgSi(H),SClAr(VH) and iron(Fe) components in the assumed primary cosmicray spectrum of the HD and PD models (Amenomori et al. 2000). sition study around the knee. In order to examine the composition dependence involved in the all-particle spectrum, we used two kinds of the mixed composition models. One is based on the dominance of heavy component around the knee as reported by works (Amenomori et al. 2006a;Amenomori et al. 2000;Ogio 2004) and this composition is called HD model. Another is based on the dominance of light component (p and He) as reported by works (Antoni et al. 2005;Raino 2004;Fowler 2001) and called PD model. The energy spectra of individual mass groups in HD model and PD model are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), respectively. Table 1 shows their fractional contents at given energies. In total, four kind of the primary composition, namely, pure proton, pure iron, HD model and PD model are used in the simulation with the minimum primary energy of 50 TeV. All secondary particles are traced until their energies become 1 MeV in the atmosphere. The shower axis was placed on Tibet array at random within a radius of 100 m from the center of the array. In order to treat the MC events in the same way as experimental data analysis, simulated airshower events were input to the detector with the -Primary cosmic ray composition for (a) the HD model and (b) the PD model. The all-particle spectrum, which is a sum of each component, is normalized to the Tibet data, and they are compared with other experiments.

Experimentally, the number of charged particles is defined as the PMT output (charge) divided by that of the single particle peak, which is determined by a probe calibration using cosmic rays, typically single muons. For this purpose, a small scintillator of 25 cm \u00d7 25 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm thick with a PMT (H1949) is put on the top of the each detector during the maintenance period. This is called a probe detector and is used for making the trigger of the each Tibet-III detector. The response of each detector is calibrated every year through probe calibration. In the simulation, these events triggered by the probe detector was also examined by a MC calculation, in which the primary particles were sampled in the energy range above the geomagnetic cutoff energy at Yangbajing (>10 GeV), and all secondary particles which pass the probe detector and the Tibet-III detector simultaneously were selected for the analysis. Since the value of PMT output is proportional to the energy loss of the particles passing through the scintillator, the peak position of the energy loss distribution corresponds to the experimental single peak of the probe calibration.",

We can then calculate the number of charged particles for each detector hit as the total energy loss in each scintillator divided by 6.11 MeV instead of counting the number of charged particles arriving to the detector in MC events. We confirmed that the shape of the energy loss distribution, which is determined by probe-calibration simulation, shows a reasonable agreement with the charge distribution of the experimental data as shown in Fig. 5, where the proportionality between the energy loss \u2206E and the PMT output charge Q i is assumed as Q i = k i \u00d7 \u2206E, where k i is a proportional constant depending on given detector typically being around 4 pC/MeV. Thus, all detector responses including muons and the materialization of photons inside the detector are taken into account. The total number of charged particles of each event (hereafter, we call this an \" air shower size (Ne)\") was estimated using the modified NKG lateral dis-tribution function which is tuned to reproduce the above defined number of particles using the Monte Carlo simulation under our detector configurations. The number of MC events, typically for QGSJET+HD, is as follows. About 10 million of air showers are generated with primary energy above 50 TeV. After imposing the selection criteria described in sec. 4.2, the surviving number of events is about 5 million, among which 1.9 million events belong to the unbiased energy region corresponding to E0>100 TeV.

            "text": "where r m \u2032 = 30 m, and the variable s corresponds to the age parameter, N e is the total number of shower particles and B denotes the beta function. The original meaning of r m in NKG formula is a Moliere unit, being 130 m at Tibet altitude, however, we treat r \u2032 m as a unit scale of the lateral distribution suitable to describe the structure of the air showers observed by Tibet-III array, whose effective area is 135 m \u00d7 135 m. The functions a(s) and b(s) are determined as follows. In CORSIKA simulation, the shower age parameter s is calculated at observation level by fitting the number of particles to a function for the one dimensional shower development. It may be possible to assume that air showers with the same shower age s, are in almost the same stage of air-shower development in the atmosphere, i.e. they show almost the same lateral distribution for shower particles irrespective of their primary energies. The lateral distribution of the particle density obtained by the simulation with carpet array configuration is normalized by the total number of particles which is derived from the total energy deposit in an infinitely wide scintillator. These events are then classified according to the stage of air-shower development using the age parameter and they are averaged over the classified events. The fitting of the equation 3to the averaged MC data is made to obtain the numerical values a and b. Thus, we can obtain the behavior of a and b as a function of s as shown in Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b), where original definitions of a(s) and b(s) in NKG function are shown by dotted lines. Although our result shows different dependences of a and b on s from the original NKG function, it is confirmed that the lateral distribution of the shower particles is better reproduced by our formula (see Fig. 11). This expression is valid in the range of s = 0.6 \u223c 1.6, sec \u03b8 < 1.1 and r = 5 \u223c 3000 m. Two interaction models of QGSJET01c and SIBYLL2.1 and four primary composition models of pure proton, pure iron, HD and PD are used independently to  determine the functions a(s) and b(s) and used in the analysis described below. Other details are described in Ref. (Amenomori et al. 2007). Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, the correlation between the true shower size (true size) and the estimated shower size (fit size) is demonstrated in Fig. 12(a) and Fig. 12(b). Here, the true shower size means the number of particles calculated for a carpet array while estimated shower size is for the real Tibet-III array using the modified NKG function mentioned above. As seen in these two figures, a good correlation is obtained between the true shower size and the estimated shower size. The systematic deviation of less than 1 % seen around 100 TeV of Fig. 12(a) shows that we need finer tuning of modified NKG function at low energies and this error is finally corrected. The shower size is well reproduced with standard deviation of 5% around the primary energy of 1000 TeV with 1.0 < sec(\u03b8) \u2264 1.1 based on the QGSJET+HD model. The shower size resolutions estimated are summarized for the events with different simulation model combinations in Table 2.",

It may be, however, worthwhile to note here that this effect is already included in our method of the energy determination using the conversion function, because the primary energy at a given shower size is determined including the contribution of all possible primary energies which leads to a smaller value than the case of without fluctuation reflecting the larger population of low energy primaries than high energies.

The model dependence on the primary composition can be checked by comparing the results of QGSJET+HD and QGSJET+PD. Although the composition is fairly different between the HD and PD model at energies above 10 15 eV, the difference of the absolute intensity is 20% at most between the two models and decreases with increasing primary energy. As mentioned above, it may be helpful to show the composition dependence by the pure component assumption. The difference between pure proton and pure iron primary model becomes large at the lower energy region of the range shown in this figure, where the difference of the intensities between two models exceeds a factor of 3 at 10 14 eV, although these results do not belong to the argument for the reality at least in the energy range lower than a few times 10 14 eV. It should be noted that the mixed composition models give more realistic extension of the direct observations and the composition model dependence almost disappears above 10 16 eV. This is the remarkable characteristics of the Tibet experiment.",

Our results seem to lead to the data of direct observation smoothly in the low energy side.

In order to quantitatively confirm these characteristics, the model dependence on the primary chemical composition was estimated in terms of the two mixed chemical composition models of HD (heavy dominant) and PD (proton dominant), which are extrapolated from the direct observations with different scheme of the fractional contents of the individual elements, together with the extreme cases of pure proton and pure iron. The interaction model dependence was discussed using QGSJET01c and SIBYLL2.1 interaction models as they are widely used by other works. It was shown that the air showers induced by primary energies above 100 TeV are fully detected for all kind of primary particles. The systematic errors due to the above mentioned model dependences are shown to be within a few tens % in the energy range below the knee, i.e., 20% in chemical composition models between HD and PD, and 10% in interaction models between QGSJET01c and SIBYLL2.1. The model dependence is decreasing with increasing primary energy, and it almost disappears above 10 16 eV. Although these estimates are limited for the chosen models, other choice of more adequate models, if any, will not change the result of this work drastically because of the weak dependence on the model used. The uncertainty due to the interaction model will even decrease after the measurement of the CMS forward region by the forthcoming experiment LHCf (Bonechi et al. 2006;Sako et al. 2007). This is the highest-statistical and the best systematics-controlled measurement covering the widest energy range around the knee energy region.",

This work will be extended to the analysis of the air showers with large arrival zenith angle which can show another features of the air-shower development in the atmosphere and provides the information about the chemical composition (to be published elsewhere). As mentioned before, we have already reported a paper on the proton and helium spectra around the knee (Amenomori et al. 2006a;Amenomori et al. 2000) derived from the hybrid experiment using the air-shower core detector, which is sensitive to the showers of light element origin like proton or helium by selecting the high energy core. From the observed steep power index and the low intensities of proton and helium spectra, the dominance of the heavy elements were suggested by the hybrid experiment, however, the statistics were limited due to the high threshold. In the very near future, we will start a new high-statistics hybrid experiment in Tibet (Huang et al. 2005) to clarify the main component of cosmic rays at the knee. The core detector will consist of 400 burst detectors located at the center of the Tibet-III array in a grid with the detector interval of 3.75m. The burst detectors measure the high energy electromagnetic cascade of the energy above 30 GeV developed in lead plate of 3.5 cm thick by shower-core particles. The new experiment is able to observe the air-shower cores induced by heavy components around and beyond the knee, where direct measurements are inaccessible because of their extremely low fluxes. The first observation of the iron spectrum in the knee region is expected in this new experiment.",
