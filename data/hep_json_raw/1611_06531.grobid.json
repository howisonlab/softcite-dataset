            "text": "There is extensive experimental evidence, eg. in Refs. [1,2], that a hot and strongly interacting medium is formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It is expected that color screening of the quark-antiquark binding potential within such a medium would render quarkonium formation less likely [3], an effect colloquially referred to as \"melting\" of the bound state. Since quarkonium states with stronger binding energies would melt at higher temperatures than the more weakly bound states, measuring the yields of different quarkonium states may reveal a sequential suppression pattern, thus serving as a thermometer for the medium [4]. Although the suppression of charmonia was anticipated as a key signature of the quark-gluon plasma formation [3], later studies revealed that several concurrent effects, such as recombination of uncorrelated cc pairs in the medium, cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects and feed-down from higher-mass states, complicate the interpretation of the results [5,6,7]. Bottomonia, on the other hand, are less affected by recombination at top RHIC energies, and CNM effects are also expected to be moderate at mid-rapidity. Thus the measurements of the \u03a5(nS) states provide a cleaner probe of the strongly interacting medium.",

            "text": "Recent results from STAR [8] show that in central Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV, the \u03a5(1S+2S+3S) production is suppressed to an extent that cannot be explained by CNM effects only. In the same study the yields of the excited states are consistent with a complete suppression. Since the energy density in central U+U collisions is estimated to be about 20% higher on the average than that in central Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [9], studies of quarkonium production in U+U collisions can provide further tests of the sequential suppression hypothesis. Recent installation of the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) [10], on the other hand, opened the door for precision measurements of quarkonia at STAR via the dimuon decay channel. GeV triggered by high-energy electrons (or positrons) with an integrated luminosity of 263.4 \u00b5b \u22121 . The analysis of this data, briefly recapitulated here, is described in details in Ref. [12]. The tracks of the electron candidates are reconstructed in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), and then matched with energy deposits in the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC). Electron identification is carried out in the TPC based on fractional energy loss, and in the BEMC based on the shape of the electromagnetic shower. Electron candidates have to have their energy-tomomentum ratio close to unity. Identified electron and positron candidates are then paired in order to reconstruct the invariant mass of the \u03a5 candidates. The combinatorial background is then reconstructed using like-sign electron (positron) pairs. Since Drell-Yan processes and open bb production yield correlated backround in the signal region, combinatorial background cannot be simply subtracted to get the signal. Instead, a simultaneous fit is applied on the unlike-sign and like-sign invariant mass data. The former is constructed as a sum of the three \u03a5 (nS) peaks, the correlated and the combinatorial background. A priori knowledge on the shapes of the signal and background shapes were obtained from simulations [8,12] in order to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit. Figure 1 shows the invariant mass distributions together with the fitted functions on the combinatorial and correlated backgrounds as well as the signal peaks. We use the nuclear modification factor to quantify suppression, defined as",

The new U+U data consolidate observations made previously in Au+Au data: considering 0-10% centrality Au+Au and U+U points together, both the \u03a5(1S+2S+3S) and \u03a5(1S) points are significantly suppressed, similar in extent to data from the LHC [14] but this suppression is not complete [12]. Theory comparisons [15,16,17] show that data favor scenarios where the qq pairs are strongly bound, over the weakly bound ones. Figure 3 shows the nuclear modification factor of \u03a5 states measured in U+U collisions at \u221a s NN = 193 GeV and Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV, compared to high-p T J/\u03c8 in Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [18].

The Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), completed in 2014, is designed for precision measurements of quarkonia production via the dimuon channel. It is installed outside the solenoidal magnet of STAR, covering 45% of the azimuth angle within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.5. Its Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) technology provides means to trigger on muons and identify them. Figure 4 shows the invariant mass spectrum of \u03a5 candidates reconstructed via the dimuon channel.
