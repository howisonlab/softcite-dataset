We also measure the differential decay rates and study the form factors of these two decays. With the values of |Vcs| and |V cd | from Particle Data Group fits assuming CKM unitarity, we obtain the values of the form factors at q 2 = 0, f K + (0) = 0.725 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.012 and f \u03c0 + (0) = 0.622 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b1 0.003. Taking input from recent lattice QCD calculations of these form factors, we determine values of the CKM matrix elements |Vcs| = 0.944 \u00b1 0.005 \u00b1 0.015 \u00b1 0.024 and |V cd | = 0.210 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b1 0.009, where the third uncertainties are theoretical.",

The dE/dx, TOF and EMC measurements (deposited energy and shape of the electromag-netic shower) are combined to form confidence levels for the e hypothesis (CL e ), the \u03c0 hypothesis (CL \u03c0 ), and the K hypothesis (CL K ). Positron candidates are required to have CL e greater than 0.1% and to satisfy CL e /(CL e + CL \u03c0 + CL K ) > 0.8. In addition, we include the 4-momenta of near-by photons within 5 \u2022 of the direction of the positron momentum to partially account for final-state-radiation energy losses (FSR recovery). The neutral kaon candidates are built from pairs of oppositely charged tracks that are assumed to be pions. For each pair of charged tracks, a vertex fit is performed and the resulting track parameters are used to calculate the invariant mass, M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). If M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is in the range (0.484, 0.512) GeV/c 2 , the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair is treated as a K 0 S candidate and is used for further analysis. The neutral pion candidates are reconstructed via the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays. For the photon selection, we require the energy of the shower deposited in the barrel (end-cap) EMC greater than 25 (50) MeV and the shower time be within 700 ns of the event start time. In addition, the angle between the photon and the nearest charged track is required to be greater than 10 \u2022 . We accept the pair of photons as a \u03c0 0 candidate if the invariant mass of the two photons, M (\u03b3\u03b3), is in the range (0.110, 0.150) GeV/c 2 . A 1-Constraint (1-C) kinematic fit is then performed to constrain M (\u03b3\u03b3) to the \u03c0 0 nominal mass, and the resulting 4-momentum of the candidate \u03c0 0 is used for further analysis.",

For the selection of the D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd e decay, we require that there is only one additional charged track consistent with the positron identification criteria and at least two photons that are used to form a \u03c0 0 candidate in the rest of the event.
