            "text": "The top quark is the most massive particle in the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Since its discovery in 1995 [1,2], considerable advances have been made in understanding its properties. At hadron colliders top quarks arise predominantly from the production of top quark-antiquark (tt) pairs through the strong interaction. However, top quarks may also be produced singly from electroweak processes through three different production mechanisms. These are categorised by the virtuality of the W boson involved in the interaction: t-channel, s-channel and associated tW production. At the CERN LHC, the t-and tW channel production have been observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations and their cross sections have been measured at both 7 and 8 TeV, respectively [3][4][5][6][7][8]. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have recently published results of searches for s-channel single top quark production using 8 TeV data [9,10]. The high integrated luminosity and centre-of-mass energy at the LHC motivate the search for rare SM single top quark production processes, such as the production of a single top quark in association with a Z boson, where the top quark is produced via the t channel and the Z boson is either radiated off one of the participating quarks or produced via W boson fusion (figure 1). These production mechanisms, referred to here as tZq-SM production, lead to a signature with -1 -JHEP07(2017)003 a single top quark, a Z boson, and an additional quark. The process is sensitive to the coupling of the top quark to the Z boson, as illustrated in figure 1(middle-right). It is also related to WZ boson production, as can be seen in figure 1(bottom-left). Thus, the observation of tZq production and the subsequent measurement of the production cross section represent a test of the SM. The predicted tZq-SM production cross section for protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, at next-to-leading order (NLO), is \u03c3(pp \u2192 tZq) = 236 +11 \u22124 (scale) \u00b1 11 (PDF) fb [11], where t denotes either a top quark or antiquark. The first uncertainty is associated with the renormalisation and factorisation scales used, and the second one is associated with the choice of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The CTEQ6M set of PDFs [12] is used to determine the predicted cross section. The cross section of the three-lepton final state, \u03c3(pp \u2192 t + \u2212 q) B(t \u2192 \u03bdb), where denotes a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau), is calculated to be \u03c3(pp \u2192 t + \u2212 q) B(t \u2192 \u03bdb) = 8.2 fb with a theoretical uncertainty of less than 10%. The calculation is made in the five-flavour scheme, where b quarks are considered as coming from the interacting protons, with Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo [13], using the NNPDF (version 2) PDF set [14]. This includes lepton pairs from off-shell Z bosons with an invariant mass m + \u2212 > 50 GeV. This cross section is used as a reference in this paper. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have published results searching for ttZ production, which is also sensitive to the coupling of the top quark to the Z boson [15][16][17][18]. A production cross section of \u03c3(pp \u2192 ttZ) = 200 +80 \u221270 (stat) +40 \u221230 (syst) fb was measured by CMS at 8 TeV [16]. Within the SM, any flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) involving the top quark and the Z boson, referred to here as tZ-FCNC, is forbidden at tree level and is suppressed at higher orders because of the GIM mechanism [19]. Some SM extensions, such as R-parity violating supersymmetric models [20], top-colour assisted technicolour models [21] and singlet quark models [22], predict enhancements of the FCNC branching fraction, which could be as large as O(10 \u22124 ) [23]. The production of a single top quark in association with a Z boson is sensitive to both tZq and tgq anomalous couplings [23][24][25] as shown in figures 2 and 3. Searches for FCNC in the top quark sector have already been performed at the Fermilab Tevatron [26,27] and at the LHC. The ATLAS Collaboration performed searches for anomalous tgq couplings [28] and the CMS Collaboration performed searches for t\u03b3q anomalous couplings [29], while both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations performed searches for tZq anomalous couplings [30,31]. The most stringent exclusion limit at 95% confidence level (CL) on the branching fraction B(t \u2192 Zq), set by the CMS Collaboration, excludes branching fractions greater than 0.05% [31]. In this paper, two separate searches, using similar event selections and background estimates, are presented: a search for tZq-SM production and a search for tZ-FCNC production from anomalous couplings. Both searches are performed using a data set of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . In tZq-SM production, because the processes involved are based on t-channel single top quark production, the signature consists of a single top quark, a Z boson, and an additional jet preferentially emitted in the forward region of the detector (absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7| > 2.4). The search for tZ-FCNC is performed by combining the single top quark and tt Figure 1. Leading-order tZq production Feynman diagrams (all but bottom-right). The initialand final-state quarks denoted q and q are predominantly first generation quarks, although there are smaller additional contributions from strange-and charm-initiated diagrams. The bottom-right diagram represents the NLO nonresonant contribution to the tZq process. production modes. The single top quark production leads to a signature containing a top quark and a Z boson (single-top-quark-FCNC) with no extra jets from the matrix-element calculation. For the tt production mode (tt-FCNC), the FCNC vertex appears in the decay of the top quark, and leads to the same signature as for tZq-SM, but with the jet not associated with the b quark being produced in the central region of the detector. Both searches are performed in the trilepton final state, where both the W boson from the top quark and the Z boson decay into either electrons or muons, resulting in four possible leptonic combinations in the final state: eee, \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5e, and ee\u00b5. As they are not specifically excluded, there is also a contribution from leptonic \u03c4 decays. The main sources of background to these searches are tt production, single top quark production, diboson production, ttV (V = W or Z) and Drell-Yan (DY) production. The tZq-SM production is a key irreducible background to the FCNC search. The discrimination between signal and background is achieved using a -3 -  boosted decision tree (BDT) and the nonprompt backgrounds are estimated from the data, whereas other backgrounds are estimated from simulation using constraints from data.",

The generation is achieved by describing the relevant interactions in terms of a set of effective operators that are independent of the underlying theory. The searches are thus performed in a modelindependent way. The signature corresponding to the tZ-FCNC processes can be produced both via strong tgq and weak tZq couplings, as illustrated in figure 2. The tt-FCNC pro-JHEP07 (2017)003duction, where the anomalous coupling appears in the top quark decay, is presented in figure 3.

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The ECAL provides coverage in pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.48 in the barrel region and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.0 in two endcap regions (EE). A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of 3X 0 of lead is located in front of the EE. The electron momenta are estimated by combining energy measurements in the ECAL with momentum measurements in the tracker [33]. The relative transverse momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u224845 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% in the barrel region to 4.5% in the endcaps [33]. The dielectron mass resolution for Z \u2192 ee decays when both electrons are in the ECAL barrel is 1.9%, and is 2.9% when both electrons are in the endcaps.

The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimised for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to less than 1 kHz before data storage.

Several of the background processes considered in this analysis (tt and ttW production, diboson production and Z boson production in association with multiple jets) are produced at leading order (LO) using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo Monte Carlo (MC) generator interfaced with pythia version 6.426 [39]. Single top quark background processes (tW andtW) are simulated using the powheg v.1.0 r1380 generator [40][41][42][43], which is interfaced to pythia version 8.212 for parton showering and hadronisation. The tZ-FCNC events are generated at LO using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator interfaced with pythia version 6.426. The \u03ba Lagrangian terms presented in eq. (2.1) are implemented as a new model in MadGraph5 amc@nlo by means of the FeynRules package [44] and of the universal FeynRules output format [45]. The complex chiral parameters are fixed to the following values:f R q = 0 andf L q = 1. All samples generated with powheg and Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo use the CT10 [46] PDF set. The value of the top quark mass used in all the simulated samples is m t = 172.5 GeV. All samples include W boson decays to \u03c4 leptons, as well as to electrons and/or muons. The characterisation of the underlying event uses the pythia Z2* tune [47,48] for the MadGraph5 amc@nlo and powheg samples, and the CUETP8M1 tune [48] for the tZq-SM sample. Additional samples of tZq-SM, tZ-FCNC, ttV, and WZ are generated, varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales, for studies of systematic effects. For the ttV and WZ backgrounds, further samples are generated varying the merging threshold in MadGraph5 amc@nlo. The expected cross sections are obtained from next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations for tt [49] and Z/\u03b3 * processes [50], NLO plus next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic calculations for single top quark production in the tW or ttW channels [51], and NLO calculations for VV [52] and ttV [53,54] processes. For all samples of simulated events, multiple minimum-bias events generated with pythia are added to simulate the presence of additional proton-proton interactions (pileup) from the same bunch crossing or in neighbouring proton bunches. To refine the simulation, the events are weighted to reproduce the distribution in the number of pileup vertices inferred from data. Most generated samples contain full simulation of detector effects, using the JHEP07 (2017)003Geant4 package [55], including simulation of the machine running conditions, while the FCNC samples are processed using a fast simulation of the detector [56].",

            "text": "In the searches presented in this paper, the signal signature contains a Z boson and a top quark, which both decay leptonically to either electrons or muons. Thus the final state for both searches consists of three leptons (electrons and/or muons, including those coming from tau decays), plus an escaping undetected neutrino that is inferred from an imbalance in the transverse momentum. The signature also includes a bottom quark jet (b jet) that arises from the hadronisation of the b quark produced in the top quark decay. In the final state for tZq-SM production, or for tt-FCNC, there is an additional jet arising from the hadronisation of a light or a charm quark. The data used in this analysis were collected with the CMS detector during the 2012 proton-proton data taking period at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data are selected online using triggers that rely on the presence of two high-p T leptons, ee, e\u00b5, or \u00b5\u00b5. The highest-p T lepton is required to satisfy p T > 17 GeV, while the second-highest-p T lepton must satisfy p T > 8 GeV. In addition, the trigger selection requires loose lepton identification for both lepton flavours; electrons are additionally required to pass online isolation requirements. The resulting trigger efficiencies are 99% for eee and ee\u00b5, 98% for \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5 and 89% for \u00b5\u00b5e. For tZ-FCNC production, the trigger acceptance is enhanced by using single-lepton and trilepton triggers with various p T thresholds, resulting in a trigger efficiency close to 100%, after all selection cuts. The trigger efficiency is obtained from data collected with an independent trigger selection based on missing transverse momentum. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as missing transverse momentum, p miss T . A particle-flow event reconstruction algorithm [57,58] identifies each individual particle with an optimised combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of the photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of the electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The momentum of the muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of the charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits. Finally, the energy of the neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL deposits. The tracks reconstructed in the silicon tracker are used to identify and construct a series of interaction vertices, which correspond to the pileup. For each vertex, the sum of the transverse momenta squared of the associated tracks is calculated. The vertex whose sum is largest is taken to be the event primary vertex, provided that it is reconstructed using four or more tracks and that it lies within 24 cm of the nominal interaction point in the z direction and within 2 cm in the transverse plane. Each event must contain exactly three electrons and/or JHEP07 (2017)003muons, reconstructed by the particle-flow algorithm. Each lepton must have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 (electron) or |\u03b7| < 2.4 (muon) and must be isolated. Isolation is determined by calculating the sum of p T of all the other reconstructed particles that lie within a cone of fixed radius \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 around the lepton, correcting for the expected contribution from pileup [59] and dividing the corrected sum by the p T of the lepton. The resulting quantity is denoted I rel . For electrons, the cone size is set to \u2206R = 0.3 and I rel must be less than 0.15. For muons, the cone size is set to \u2206R = 0.4 and I rel must be less than 0.12. Events that contain additional leptons, satisfying the same kinematic selection but with relaxed lepton identification criteria, are rejected. Lepton isolation and identification efficiencies in simulation are corrected to match the ones measured in data using a tag-and-probe method [60]. Two of the same-flavour leptons in each event are required to have opposite electric charge, and have an invariant mass, m , compatible with the Z boson mass, i.e. 76 < m < 106 GeV. In the eee and \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5 channels, the pair of oppositely charged leptons having an invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass is used to form the Z boson candidate. In the ee\u00b5 and \u00b5\u00b5e channels, the same-flavour leptons are used to form the Z boson candidate. For all channels, the third lepton is assumed to come from the decay of the W boson. Jets are clustered from the particles reconstructed using the particle-flow algorithm with the infrared and collinear safe anti-k T algorithm [61,62], operated with a distance parameter R = 0.5. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true particle-level jet momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from pileup interactions. Corrections for the jet energy are derived from simulation, and are corrected with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events [63]. For the tZ-FCNC analysis, only jets that satisfy p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are used in the results presented here, while for the tZq-SM analysis, the maximum allowed value of |\u03b7| is relaxed to 4.5 to improve the signal acceptance, as for single top quark t-channel processes the extra light jet is mostly produced in the forward region. Jets that are reconstructed close to a selected lepton (\u2206R < 0.5) are removed. Jets that originate from the hadronisation of a b quark are identified (tagged) using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [64]. This algorithm combines various track-based variables with vertex-based variables to construct a discriminating observable in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. The discriminant is used to distinguish between b jets and non-b jets. For the results presented here, the so-called loose operating point is used. This corresponds to a b tagging efficiency of about 85% and a misidentification probability of 10% for light-flavour or gluon jets, as estimated from QCD multijet simulations. The value of the b tagging discriminant is also used in the multivariate discriminator. Corrections to the b tagging discriminant shape have been determined using tt and multijet control samples, and are then applied to the signal and background data sets [64]. In the search for tZq-SM production, two or more selected jets are required, one or more of which must also satisfy the b tagging requirements. In the search for tZ-FCNC production, two different signal selections are considered. In a first selection, denoted as single-top-quark-FCNC selection, exactly one selected jet is required, which has to pass the b tagging requirement. A second selection (tt-FCNC selection) asks for at least two selected jets with at least one passing the b tag-JHEP07 2017  Table 2.

            "text": "The normalisation of the nonprompt lepton and WZ background is estimated by fitting the m W T distribution. The m W T distribution peaks around the W mass for a lepton and p miss T from a W boson decay, while for nonprompt lepton backgrounds it peaks close to zero and falls rapidly. This difference in shape allows a simultaneous estimation of the nonprompt lepton and the WZ backgrounds to be made. In the ee\u00b5 and \u00b5\u00b5e final states, the sameflavour opposite-sign leptons are assumed to come from the Z boson, hence the remaining lepton (third lepton) is assumed to come from the W boson and is used to compute the transverse mass. For the eee and \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5 final states, both opposite sign combinations are considered. The normalised m W T distributions (templates) for events containing a nonprompt lepton are obtained by inverting the isolation criteria on the third lepton. The resulting event sample is expected to be dominated by DY events, although a small number of tt events are expected. The signal is extracted by performing a simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood fit to the distributions of the signal samples and the backgroundenriched control region, using the two different discriminators. The background-enriched control region helps to constrain the backgrounds in the signal sample by means of nui-JHEP07(2017)003  sance parameters. A common fit is performed simultaneously for the four different final states (eee, ee\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5e, and \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5). In order to validate the fit procedure, an additional fit is performed in the background-enriched region only and the background normalisations are extracted from this fit. These normalisations are used to compare the data to the predictions as shown in figure 6. Reasonable agreement in normalisation and shape between data and predictions is found, validating the background model.",

An events yield compatible -17 -JHEP07 (2017)003with tZq standard model production is observed, and the corresponding cross section is measured to be 10 +8 \u22127 fb. The corresponding observed and expected significances are 2.4 and 1.8 standard deviations, respectively. A search for tZ production produced via flavour-changing neutral current interactions, either in single-top-quark or tt production modes, was also performed. For this search the standard model tZq process was considered as a background. No evidence for tZ-FCNC interactions is found, and limits at 95% confidence level are set on the branching fraction for the decay of a top quark into a Z boson and a quark. The limits are B(t \u2192 Zu) < 0.022% and B(t \u2192 Zc) < 0.049%, which improve the previous limits set by the CMS Collaboration by about a factor of two.",
