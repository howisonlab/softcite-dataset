The measurements use pp collision at the LHC with center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, and pp collision at the Tevatron with \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. These include measurements of W\u03b3, Z\u03b3, WW, WZ and ZZ production. The results are compared with Standard Model predictions, and are interpreted in terms of constraints on charged and neutral anomalous triple gauge couplings.",

Especially, it is sensitive to the selfinteractions among vector bosons via triple gauge couplings. Any significant deviation of the production cross section or kinematic distributions from the SM predictions gives an indication of new physics. In addition, non-resonant diboson production measurements are important to a precise estimation of irreducible backgrounds for the Higgs study.",

            "text": "The SM describes exactly how vector bosons couple with each other, and diboson productions are sensitive to these couplings. Even if new physics is at very high energy scale, beyond the reach of current colliders (which means direct pair production of new particle is impossible ), it could still have indirect effect on triple gauge couplings through virtual corrections. Anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC) could be modeled by adding terms to the SM Lagrangian, using a set of parameters, listed in Table 2. All these parameters are equal to zero in the SM. This is a common approach to parameterize low energy effects from high energy scale new physics, which allows for experimental results to be interpreted as model independent constrains on aTGC.",
