This paper is the first comprehensive presentation of the Higgs physics reach of CLIC operating at three energy stages: \u221a s = 350 GeV, 1.4 and 3 TeV. The initial stage of operation allows the study of Higgs boson production in Higgsstrahlung (e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH) and WW-fusion (e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde ), resulting in precise measurements of the production cross sections, the Higgs total decay width \u0393 H , and model-independent determinations of the Higgs couplings. Operation at \u221a s > 1 TeV provides high-statistics samples of Higgs bosons produced through WW-fusion, enabling tight constraints on the Higgs boson couplings. Studies of the rarer processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 ttH and e + e \u2212 \u2192 HH\u03bd e\u03bde allow measurements of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs boson self-coupling. This paper presents detailed studies of the precision achievable with Higgs measurements at CLIC and describes the interpretation of these measurements in a global fit.",

            "text": "The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a mature option for a future multi-TeV high-luminosity linear e + e \u2212 collider that is currently under development at CERN. It is based on a novel two-beam acceleration technique providing accelerating gradients of 100 MV/m. Recent implementation studies for CLIC have converged towards a staged approach. In this scheme, CLIC provides high-luminosity e + e \u2212 collisions at centre-of-mass energies from a few 100 GeV up to 3 TeV. The ability of CLIC to collide e + e \u2212 up to multi-TeV energy scales is unique. For the current study, the nominal centreof-mass energy of the first energy stage is \u221a s = 350 GeV. At this centre-of-mass energy, the Higgsstrahlung and WWfusion processes have significant cross sections, providing access to precise measurement of the absolute values of the Higgs boson couplings to both fermions and bosons. Another advantage of operating CLIC at \u221a s \u2248 350 GeV is that it enables a programme of precision top quark physics, including a scan of the tt cross section close to the production threshold. In practice, the centre-of-mass energy of the second stage of CLIC operation will be motivated by both the machine design and results from the LHC. In this paper, it is assumed that the second CLIC energy stage has \u221a s = 1.4 TeV and that the ultimate CLIC centre-of-mass energy is 3 TeV. In addition to direct and indirect searches for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomena, these higher energy stages of operation provide a rich potential for Higgs physics beyond that accessible at lower energies, such as the direct measurement of the top Yukawa coupling and a direct probe of the Higgs potential through the measurement of the Higgs self-coupling. Furthermore, rare Higgs boson decays become accessible due to the higher integrated luminosities at higher energies and the increasing cross section for Higgs production in WW-fusion. The proposed staged approach spans around twenty years of running.",

The RF power is used to accelerate the main particle beam that runs parallel to the drive beam. CLIC uses normal-conducting accelerator structures, operated at room temperature. These structures permit high accelerating gradients, while the short pulse duration discussed below limits ohmic losses to tolerable levels. The initial drive beams and the main electron/positron beams are generated in the central complex and are then injected at the ends of the two linac arms. The feasibility of the CLIC accelerator has been demonstrated through prototyping, simulations and large-scale tests, as described in the Conceptual Design Report [10]. In particular, the two-beam acceleration at gradients exceeding 100 MV/m has been demonstrated in the CLIC test facility, CTF3. High luminosities are achievable by very small beam emittances, which are generated in the injector complex and maintained during transport to the interaction point.",

Each bunch train consists of 312 individual bunches, with 0.5 ns between bunch crossings at the interaction point. The average number of hard e + e \u2212 interactions in a single bunch train crossing is much less than one. However, for CLIC operation at \u221a s > 1 TeV, the highly-focussed intense beams lead to significant beamstrahlung (radiation of photons from electrons/positrons in the electric field of the other beam). Beamstrahlung results in high rates of incoherent electron-positron pairs and low-Q 2 t-channel multiperipheral \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadron events, where Q 2 is the negative of the four-momentum squared of the virtual space-like photon. In addition, the energy loss through beamstrahlung generates a long lower-energy tail to the luminosity spectrum Fig. 1 The luminosity spectrum for CLIC operating at \u221a s = 3 TeV, where \u221a s is the effective centre-of-mass energy after beamstrahlung and initial state radiation [11] that extends well below the nominal centre-of-mass energy, as shown in Fig. 1. Both the CLIC detector design and the event reconstruction techniques employed are optimised to mitigate the influence of these backgrounds, which are most severe at the higher CLIC energies; this is discussed further in Sect. 4",

As a result, the CLIC detector concepts [11], CLIC_SiD and CLIC_ILD, are based on fine-grained electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters (ECAL and HCAL), optimised for particle-flow reconstruction techniques. In the particle-flow approach, the aim is to reconstruct the individual final-state particles within a jet using information from the tracking detectors combined with that from the highly granular calorimeters [15][16][17][18]. In addition, particle-flow event reconstruction provides a powerful tool for the rejection of beam-induced backgrounds [11]. The CLIC detector concepts employ strong central solenoid magnets, located outside the HCAL, providing an axial magnetic field of 5 T in CLIC_SiD and 4 T in CLIC_ILD. The CLIC_SiD concept employs central siliconstrip tracking detectors, whereas CLIC_ILD assumes a large central gaseous Time Projection Chamber. In both concepts, the central tracking system is augmented with siliconbased inner tracking detectors. The two detector concepts are shown schematically in Fig. 2 and are described in detail in [11].",

The   has the largest cross section, but the WW-fusion process (e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde ) is also significant. The combined study of these two processes probes the Higgs boson properties (width and branching ratios) in a model-independent manner. In the higher energy stages of CLIC operation ( \u221a s = 1.4 TeV and 3 TeV), Higgs production is dominated by the WW-fusion process, with the ZZ-fusion process (e + e \u2212 \u2192 He + e \u2212 ) also becoming significant. Here the increased WW-fusion cross section, combined with the high luminosity of CLIC, results in large data samples, allowing precise O(1%) measurements of the couplings of the Higgs boson to both fermions and gauge bosons. In addition to the main Higgs production channels, rarer processes such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 ttH and e + e \u2212 \u2192 HH\u03bd e\u03bde , provide access to the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Fig. 5. In all cases, the Higgs production cross sections can be increased with polarised electron (and positron) beams as discussed in Sect. 3.2. Table 1 lists the expected numbers of ZH, H\u03bd e\u03bde and He + e \u2212 events for the three main CLIC centre-of-mass energy stages. These numbers account for the effect of beamstrahlung and initial state radiation (ISR), which result in a tail in the distribution of the effective centre-of-mass energy \u221a s . The impact of beamstrahlung on the expected numbers of events is mostly small. For example, it results in an approximately 10% reduction in the numbers of H\u03bd e\u03bde events at \u221a s > 1 TeV (compared to the beam spectrum with ISR alone), because the cross section rises relatively slowly with \u221a s. The reduction of the effective centre-of-mass energies due to ISR and beamstrahlung increases the ZH cross section at \u221a s = 1.4 and 3 TeV.

Firstly, the reduction in cross section at \u221a s = 350 GeV is compensated, in part, by the increased instantaneous luminosity achievable at a higher centre-of-mass energy. The instantaneous luminosity scales approximately linearly with the centre-of-mass energy, L \u221d \u03b3 e , where \u03b3 e is the Lorentz factor for the beam electrons/positrons. For this reason, the precision on the coupling g HZZ at 350 GeV is comparable to that achievable at 250 GeV for the same period of operation. Secondly, the additional boost of the Z and H at \u221a s = 350 GeV provides greater separation between the final-state jets from Z and H decays. Consequently, the measurements of \u03c3 (ZH) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 X ) are more precise at \u221a s = 350 GeV. Thirdly, and most importantly, operation of CLIC at \u221a s \u2248 350 GeV provides access to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde fusion process; this improves the precision with which the total decay width \u0393 H can be determined at CLIC. For the above reasons, the preferred option for the first stage of CLIC operation is \u221a s \u2248 350 GeV. Another advantage of \u221a s \u2248 350 GeV is that detailed studies of the top-pair production process can be performed in the initial stage of CLIC operation. Finally, the Higgs boson mass can be measured at \u221a s = 350 GeV with similar precision as at \u221a s = 250 GeV.",

Realistic levels of pile-up from the most important beam-induced background, the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons process, are included in all the simulated event samples to ensure that the impact on the event reconstruction is correctly modelled. The \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons events are simulated separately and a randomly chosen subset, corresponding to 60 bunch crossings, is superimposed on the physics event before the digitisation step [38]. 60 bunch crossings is equivalent to 30 ns, which is much longer than the assumed offline event reconstruction window of 10 ns around the hard physics event, so this is a good approximation [11]. For the \u221a s = 350 GeV samples, where the background rates are lower, 300 bunch crossings are overlaid on the physics event. The impact of the background is small at \u221a s = 350 GeV, and is most significant at \u221a s = 3 TeV, where approximately 1.2 TeV of energy is deposited in the calorimeters in a time window of 10 ns. A dedicated reconstruction algorithm identifies and removes approximately 90% of these out-of-time background particles using criteria based on the reconstructed transverse momentum p T of the particles and the calorimeter cluster time. A more detailed description can be found in [11].",

Because of the presence of pile-up from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons, it was found that the Durham [40] algorithm employed at LEP is not optimal for CLIC studies. Instead, the hadron-collider inspired k t algorithm [41,42], with the distance parameter R based on \u0394\u03b7 and \u0394\u03c6, is found to give better performance since it increases distances in the forward region, thus reducing the clustering of the (predominantly low transverse momentum) background particles together with those from the hard e + e \u2212 interaction. Instead, particles that are found by the k t  Fig. 7 Reconstructed invariant mass of Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 candidates in e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH \u2192 ZWW * events at \u221a s = 350 GeV. Bremsstrahlung photons in cones of different opening angles around the electron direction are recovered as described in the text. All distributions are normalised to unity algorithm to be closer to the beam axis than to any other particles, and that are thus likely to have originated from beam-beam backgrounds, are removed from the event. As a result of using the R-based k t algorithm, the impact of the pile-up from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons is largely mitigated, even without the timing and momentum cuts described above. Further details are given in [11]. The choice of R is optimised separately for different analyses. In many of the following studies, events are forced into a particular N -jet topology. The variable y i j is the smallest k t distance when combining j jets to i = ( j \u2212 1) jets. These resolution parameters are widely used in a number of event selections, allowing events to be categorised into topologically different final states. In several studies it is found to be advantageous first to apply the k t algorithm to reduce the beam-beam backgrounds, and then to use only the remaining objects as input to the Durham algorithm.",

The four-momentum of the (Higgs boson) system recoiling against the Z can be obtained from E rec = \u221a s \u2212 E Z and p rec = \u2212p Z , and the recoil mass, m rec , peaks sharply around m H . The recoil mass analysis for leptonic decays of the Z is described in Sect. 5.1.1. While these measurements provide a clean model-independent probe of ZH production, they are limited by the relatively small leptonic branching ratios of the Z. Studies of ZH production with Z \u2192 qq are inherently less clean, but are statistically more powerful. Despite the challenges related to the reconstruction of hadronic Z decays in the presence of various Higgs decay modes, a precise and nearly model-independent probe of ZH production can be obtained by analysing the recoil mass in hadronic Z decays, as detailed in Sect. 5.1.2. When all these measurements are taken together, a model-independent measurement of the g HZZ coupling constant with a precision of < 1% can be inferred [45].",

In contrast, for Z \u2192 qq decays, the selection efficiency shows a stronger dependence on the Higgs decay mode [45]. For example, e + e \u2212 \u2192 (Z \u2192 qq)(H \u2192 bb) events consist of four jets and the reconstruction of the Z boson is complicated by ambiguities in associations of particles with jets and the three-fold ambiguity in associating four jets with the hadronic decays of the Z and H. For this reason, it is much more difficult to construct a selection based only on the reconstructed Z \u2192 qq decay that has a selection efficiency independent of the Higgs decay mode. The strategy adopted is to first reject events consistent with a number of clear background topologies using the information from the whole event; and then to identify e + e \u2212 \u2192 (Z \u2192 qq)H events solely based on the properties from the candidate Z \u2192 qq decay. The (Z \u2192 qq)H event selection proceeds in three separate stages. In the first stage, to allow for possible BSM invisible Higgs decay modes, events are divided into candidate visible Higgs decays and candidate invisible Higgs decays, in both cases produced along with a Z \u2192 qq. Events are categorised as potential visible Higgs decays if they are not compatible with a clear two-jet topology:",

The invariant mass of the system recoiling against the Z boson candidate, m rec , is calculated assuming E rec = \u221a s \u2212 E qq and p rec = \u2212p qq .

To mitigate this effect, the Z candidate for the event selection can either be formed from the four-jet topology as described above, or can be formed from a jet pair after forcing the event into a five-jet topology.

Since the parameters in this analysis are determined in a combined extraction from overlapping distributions, the results are correlated. In particular the Higgsstrahlung and WW-fusion results for the same final states show sizeable anti-correlations, as large as \u221238% for the cases of H \u2192 cc and H \u2192 gg. These correlations are taken into account in the global fits described in Sect. 12.  Because of the neutrino(s) produced in \u03c4 decays, the signature for H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 is less distinct than that for other decay modes. The invariant mass of the visible decay products of the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 system will be less than m H , and it is difficult to identify H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays from the WW-fusion process or from Higgsstrahlung events where Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd. For this reason, the product of \u03c3 (ZH) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) is only determined for the case of hadronic Z decays at \u221a s = 350 GeV. In this analysis only hadronic \u03c4 decays are considered, so the experimental signature is two hadronic jets from Z \u2192 qq and two isolated low-multiplicity narrow jets from the two tau decays [52]. Candidate \u03c4 leptons are identified using the TauFinder algorithm [53], which is a seeded-cone based jet-clustering algorithm. The algorithm was optimised to distinguish the tau lepton decay products from hadronic gluon or quark jets. Tau cones are seeded from single tracks ( p T > 5 GeV). The seeds are used to define narrow cones of 0.05 rad. The cones are required to contain either one or three charged particles (from one-and threeprong tau decays) and further rejection of background from hadronic jets is implemented using cuts on isolation-related variables. Tau cones which contain identified electrons or muons are rejected and only the hadronic one-and threeprong \u03c4 decays are retained. The \u03c4 identification efficiency for hadronic tau decays is found to be 73% and the fake rate to mistake a quark for a \u03c4 is 5%. The fake rate is relatively high, but is acceptable as the background from final states with quarks can be suppressed using global event properties.",

The selection of Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events is more difficult compared to Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events because the e + e \u2212 \u2192 qqll background sample contains more events with electron pairs than events with muon pairs. Hence the precision achieved using Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays is somewhat better compared to that obtained using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays. The combined precision for an integrated luminosity of 500 fb \u22121 is:",

The Higgs self-coupling measurement, which is also accessed in WW-fusion production, is discussed in Sect. 9. The cross section of the Higgs production via the vector boson fusion process e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde scales with log(s) and becomes the dominating Higgs production process in e + e \u2212 collisions with \u221a s > 500 GeV. The respective cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde at \u221a s = 1.4 TeV  and 3 TeV are approximately 244 fb and 415 fb, respectively, including the effects of the CLIC beamstrahlung spectrum and ISR. The relatively large cross sections at the higher energies allow the Higgs decay modes to be probed with high statistical precision and provide access to rarer Higgs decays, such as H \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . Since WW-fusion e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd e\u03bde proceeds through the t-channel, the Higgs boson is typically boosted along the beam direction and the presence of neutrinos in the final state can result in significant missing p T . Because of the missing transverse and longitudinal momentum, the experimental signatures for H\u03bd e\u03bde production are relatively well separated from most SM backgrounds. At \u221a s = 350 GeV, the main SM background processes are two-and four-fermion production, e + e \u2212 \u2192 2 f and e + e \u2212 \u2192 4 f . At higher energies, backgrounds from \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3 e \u00b1 hard interactions become increasingly relevant for measurements of Higgs boson production in WW-fusion. Additionally, pile-up of relatively soft \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons events with the primary interaction occurs. However, this background of relatively lowp T particles is largely mitigated through the timing cuts and jet finding strategy outlined in Sect. 4.",

Events in which more than one lepton is found are not analysed further. The k t algorithm is used to cluster the particles of each event into a specific number of jets, and remove particles arising from beam-beam interactions that are closer to the beam axis than to a hard jet as described in Sect. 4.2.

The resulting systematic uncertainty on \u03c3 (H\u03bd e\u03bde ) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 bb) is 0.1%. For the Higgs mass measurement, the effect of the estimated beam polarisation uncertainty is negligible. -Jet energy scale: The measurement of the Higgs boson mass using H \u2192 bb decays requires a precise knowledge of the energy scale correction for b-jets. An uncertainty on the jet energy scale of 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 leads to a systematic uncertainty on the Higgs mass similar to the statistical error at 3 TeV. The same jet energy scale uncertainty would have negligible impact on \u03c3 (H\u03bd e\u03bde ) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 bb). A suitable process for the calibration is e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z\u03bd e\u03bde ; Z \u2192 bb which is kinematically similar to Higgs production in WW-fusion. \u03c3 (Z\u03bd e\u03bde )\u00d7 B R(Z \u2192 bb) = 276 fb leads to an expected number of events for calibration which is slightly larger than the signal event sample. To improve the precision further, additional highstatistics Z boson samples would be needed. Generatorlevel studies show that e \u00b1 \u03b3 \u2192 Ze \u00b1 ; Z \u2192 bb with a cross section about one order of magnitude larger compared to the signal process is a promising channel for this purpose. -Flavour tagging: Several of the precision measurements discussed in this paper rely on b-tagging information. The calibration of the flavour tagging at CLIC is a topic for future study. To illustrate the impact of a non-perfect understanding of the mistag rate for charm and light quark jets, an ad hoc variation of the b-tag distributions for jets in background events is performed. Even after the BDT selection, the background contains only very few b-jets in the \u03c3 (H\u03bd e\u03bde ) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 bb) analysis. First, the b-tag distributions for both jets were decreased (increased) by 0.5% using event reweighting for values below (above) the median keeping the overall number of background events constant. The opposite variation is applied in a second step. These variations lead to a \u00b10.25% change of the result. As the flavour tagging efficiency mostly affects the event rate, it is not expected to be a dominant source of systematic uncertainty for the Higgs mass measurement. In summary, it seems possible to control the systematic uncertainties discussed above with similar or better precision compared to the statistical uncertainty for the measurement of \u03c3 (H\u03bd e\u03bde ) \u00d7 B R(H \u2192 bb). An excellent understanding of the b-jet energy scale is necessary for a competitive Higgs mass measurement at CLIC. Many of the analyses described in this paper, especially where harmonization is relevant, will require a careful tuning of the Monte Carlo models using other high-precision pro-cesses. Such an investigation is beyond the scope of this first study of Higgs physics at CLIC presented here.",

The initial stage of operation, 500 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 350 GeV, allows the study of Higgs production from both the e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH and the WWfusion process. These data yield precise model-independent measurements of the Higgs boson couplings, in particular \u0394(g HZZ ) = 0.8%, \u0394(g HWW ) = 1.4% and \u0394(g Hbb ) = 3.0%. In addition, the branching ratio to invisible decay modes is constrained to \u0393 invis /\u0393 H < 0.01 at 90% C.L. and the total Higgs width is measured to \u0394(\u0393 H ) = 6.7%. Operation of CLIC at \u221a s > 1 TeV provides high-statistics samples of Higgs bosons produced through the WW-fusion process and give access to rarer processes such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 ttH and e + e \u2212 \u2192 HH\u03bd e\u03bde . Studies of these rare processes provide measurements of the top Yukawa coupling to 4.2% and the Higgs boson self-coupling to about 20%.
