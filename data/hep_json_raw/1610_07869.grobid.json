The charge asymmetries are based on the charge of the lepton from the top-quark decay and the charge of the soft muon from the semileptonic decay of a b-hadron and are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the experimental acceptance. Four CP asymmetries (one mixing and three direct) are measured and are found to be compatible with zero and consistent with the Standard Model.",

The study of CP violation, first observed in neutral kaon decays in 1964 by Christenson, Cronin, Fitch and Turlay [1], has a long and rich history within particle physics. Since the first observation, CP violation in mixing has also been observed in neutral B d and B s mesons [2][3][4], and direct CP violation has been observed in kaon decays [5][6][7] and B-meson decays [8][9][10][11][12]. However, these observations are not sufficient to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe [13]. In addition, a sizeable inclusive like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry (using a sample of primarily bb pairs) has been reported [14] by the D0 experiment in which an excess was observed over that predicted by the Standard Model (SM), when the measurement is interpreted in the form of CP asymmetries relevant JHEP02(2017)071 to this paper. This result is not confirmed by recent measurements of CP violation in B 0 d,s mixing from LHCb [15,16] and BaBar [17], which are consistent with the SM.",

[19]. All existing analyses of CP violation in B-meson decays rely on a resonant production of bb pairs or hadroproduction. The unique aspect presented in this paper is the method by which the charge of the b-quark is determined, both at production and at decay. The top quark decays before hadronisation, predominantly via t \u2192 W b. In the case where the W -boson decays leptonically, the charge of the lepton determines the charge of the produced b-quark. The b-quark hadronises and in the case that the resulting b-hadron decays semileptonically, the charge of the soft lepton determines the b-quark charge at decay. This paper exploits a soft-muon heavy-flavour tagging (SMT) algorithm [20,21] in order to measure muons that originate from such a process, hereafter referred to as SMT muons. In principle this process may also be observed via soft electrons or soft \u03c4 leptons; however, in practice the reconstruction efficiency and background rejection for these channels is unfavourable when compared to soft muons.",

Experimental ambiguity in determining the charge of the produced b-quark arises in tt pair production events when establishing if an SMT muon originated from the same-or different-top quark as the leptonically decaying W -boson. This can be resolved experimentally and corrected for as part of the unfolding procedure. An illustration of same-and different-top SMT muons is shown in figure 1.

The cell-based isolation uses the sum of all calorimeter cell energies within a cone of size \u2206R = 0.2 around the electron direction while the track-based isolation sums all track momenta within a cone of size \u2206R = 0.3; in both cases the contribution from the electron itself is excluded and the isolation criteria are optimised to individually result in a 90% efficiency for electrons from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays. To prevent double-counting of electron energy deposits as jets, jets within \u2206R = 0.2 of a reconstructed electron are removed.

The overall normalisation and the additional jets' flavour composition, (bb, cc, c, light flavours), of the W +jets background are determined via a data-driven method [77] using an orthogonal 1-lepton + 2-jets exclusive region, which is dominated by the W +jets process. The charge asymmetry normalisation and flavour composition are then extrapolated into the 1-lepton + \u2265 4-jets inclusive region used in this measurement. This estimation is performed in such a way that each variation reflecting a considered systematic uncertainty uses its own associated W +jets estimate, with only the statistical component of the estimate considered separately.",

The KLFitter places Breit-Wigner mass constraints on the top-quark and W -boson masses, and permutes reconstructed jets into each possible position in the leading-order parton representation of the tt system. Transfer functions, motivated by detector geometry, are used to map reconstructed jets to partons. For each possible permutation a likelihood and event probability are calculated, and the permutation with the highest event probability is selected. The KLFitter was configured for the +jets tt system and optimised for this measurement, with b-tagged reconstructed jets being fixed into the KLFitter b-jet positions, and allowing at most five reconstructed jets to enter the permutations. The top-quark mass was fixed at the MC mass of m top = 172.5 GeV. If a reconstructed b-tagged jet is mapped to the KLFitter leptonic b-jet position then the SMT muon is considered to be same-top-like, whereas if the b-tagged jet is mapped to the KLFitter hadronic b-jet position then the SMT muon is considered to be different-top-like. In the case of events where both b-hadrons decay semileptonically and are both experimentally tagged, one SMT muon is considered same-top-like and the other different-top-like, and both SMT muons contribute to the charge asymmetries. A misassignment probability of 21 \u00b1 1% is achieved. No additional systematic uncertainty is associated with the KLFitter as the algorithm is solely dependent on the four-momenta of the reconstructed objects, which are well described and covered by the existing systematic uncertainties. A consistent KLFitter performance is achieved across all possible charge and same-or different-top configurations, as determined in simulated tt events.",

They can be used in conjunction with the observed charge asymmetries in order to extract the various CP asymmetries. The largest uncertainties in the decay-chain fractions come from the hadron-to-muon branching ratio and the parton shower. There are two observed charge asymmetries and five CP asymmetries, leading to an underconstrained system. Following the suggestion of ref. [19], each CP asymmetry in this interpretation is considered in turn whilst setting the other four CP asymmetries to zero. Furthermore, following the convention of refs. [92] and [93], in the case of zero direct CP violation, A b mix \u2261 A bc mix and is hereafter referred to as A b mix . For any CP asymmetries appearing in both charge asymmetries, the tighter of the constraints is taken. For A b mix the tighter measurement comes solely from the A ss charge asymmetry. This technique results in the following CP asymmetries: A bc dir,sim = 0.0007 \u00b1 0.0022, (8.8) and are found to be in good agreement with the data. The uncertainties shown come from MC statistics, which are of the same size as those found from propagating the signal JHEP02(2017)071 The anomalous dimuon asymmetry observed by the D0 experiment may be interpreted in terms of both mixing and direct CP asymmetries separately, as discussed in ref. [94]. If that asymmetry is considered to be caused only by CP violation in mixing, it is calculated that A b mix \u2248 \u22120.008\u00b10.003 would be required to explain such a result. This is at odds with the SM but is not currently excluded by existing measurements of the flavour specific mixing asymmetries a d sl and a s sl (which combine as described in ref. [19] with B 0 s,d fragmentation fractions (f d , f s ) [95] to build A b mix ). The world averages for a d sl and a s sl are currently at a precision of the order of 10 \u22123 [95]. The result presented here for A b mix does not have the precision to shed more light in this area. Alternatively, the dimuon asymmetry may be considered to be caused exclusively by CP violation in direct decays. This interpretation requires that either the true A b dir \u2248 (0.003 \u00b1 0.001) or the true A c dir \u2248 (0.009 \u00b1 0.003),  Table 7.

[19], with inputs from the HFAG world average high-energy f d,s [95] and either the world average [95]  whereas the SM predictions for these parameters are of the order |A b dir | < 10 \u22127 and |A c dir | < 10 \u221211 [19,94].",

[94] may be considered, where it is stated that only limits from exclusive channels on some direct asymmetries presently exist. These limits are extrapolated (extrap.) to inclusive limits by considering uncertainties on the relevant branching ratios. They are evaluated in decay modes insensitive to the other direct CP asymmetries respectively and therefore make no assumptions on their values. The limits set at the 2\u03c3 level are A b dir (extrap.) \u2264 0.012 and A c dir (extrap.) \u2264 0.06. No limits are set on A bc dir . A full comparison of the experimental results with the SM predictions and with existing experimental limits may be found in table 7. In particular, the 2\u03c3 limits inferred by this analysis are stronger than the existing indirect limit on A c dir , and equivalent to the existing indirect limit on A b dir . Moreover, this is the first direct experimental limit on either of these direct CP asymmetries, and also the first direct experimental limit on A bc dir .",

The charge asymmetries are formed from the charge of the lepton from the top-quark decay and from the charge of the soft muon from the semileptonic decay of a b-hadron. The lepton from the top-quark decay determines the charge of the produced b-quark whilst the charge of the soft lepton determines the b-quark charge at decay.
