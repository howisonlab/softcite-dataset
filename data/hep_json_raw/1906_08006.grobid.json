The K + K \u2212 \u03b7 final state is found to be dominated by the contribution of the \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 intermediate state. The cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c6(1020)\u03b7 has been measured with a systematic uncertainty of 5.1% on the base of 3009 \u00b1 67 selected events. The obtained cross section has been used to calculate the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc (E < 1.8 GeV) = (0.321 \u00b1 0.015 stat \u00b1 0.016 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc (E < 2.0 GeV) = (0.440 \u00b1 0.015 stat \u00b1 0.022 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . From the cross section approximation the \u03c6(1680) meson parameters have been determined with better statistical precision, than in previous studies.",

The Cryogenic Magnetic Detector (CMD-3) described in [13] is installed in one of the two interaction regions of the collider. The detector tracking system consists of the cylindrical drift chamber (DC) [14] and doublelayer cylindrical multiwire proportional Z-chamber, installed inside a thin (0.085 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with 1.0-1.3 T magnetic field. Both subsystems are also used to provide the trigger signals. DC contains 1218 hexagonal cells in 18 layers and allows one to measure charged particle momentum with 1.5-4.5% accuracy in the 40-1000 MeV range, and the polar (\u03b8 ) and azimuthal (\u03d5) angles with 20 mrad and 3.5-8.0 mrad accuracy, respectively. Amplitude information from the DC signal wires is used to measure ionization losses (dE/dx) of charged particles. The barrel electromagnetic calorimeters based on liquid xenon (LXe) [15] (5.4 X 0 ) and CsI crystals (8.1 X 0 ) are placed outside the solenoid [16]. The total amount of material in front of the barrel calorimeter is 0.13 X 0 that includes the solenoid as well as the radiation shield and vacuum vessel walls. The endcap calorimeter is made of 680 BGO crystals of 13.4 X 0 thickness [16]. The magnetic flux-return yoke is surrounded by scintillation counters which are used to tag cosmic events.",

In the study of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the CMD-3 detector [22] it was found that the average detection efficiencies for kaons in experiment, (\u03b5 K exp ), and simulation, (\u03b5 K MC ), agree with the accuracy of 1% (the 0.85 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 \u2212 0.85 range was considered). Thus we estimate the systematic uncertainty of the kaon detection efficiency for the \"good\" polar angle range 1.0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 \u2212 1.0 as less than 1%. At polar angles \u03b8 < 1.0 and \u03b8 > \u03c0 \u2212 1.0 the kaon detection efficiency decreases in a different way in data and simulation, leading to the difference of the experimental and simulated kaon polar angle spectra. From that difference one can obtain the correction to the selection efficiency for the K + K \u2212 \u03b7 final state. To do this we select events from the signal peak region \u221240 MeV < E < 20 MeV with at least one kaon having the polar angle in the range 1.1 to \u03c0 \u2212 1.1 (we assume \u03b5 K exp to be equal to \u03b5 K MC in this range). Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the |\u03c0 /2 \u2212 \u03b8| distributions for the second kaon in data and simulation. The approximation of the ratio of spectra in simulation and data by the function 1 + exp(p 0 (p 1 \u2212 \u03b8)) provides a correction for the kaon selection efficiency (1 + \u03b4 K eff )(\u03b8) as a function of \u03b8 , see Fig. 12.

These values should be compared to the calculations, based on BaBar data in the corresponding E c.m. ranges: Here for a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc (E < 2.0 GeV) the total uncertainty is shown. Note, that the work [2] uses the quadratic interpolation between data points, while in the work [4] the trapezoidal rule is used. It is seen that our values for a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc for E c.m. < 1.8 GeV are about 1\u03c3 lower than previous results.",

In the production of the K + K \u2212 \u03b7 final state we observed the contribution of the \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 intermediate state only. On the base of 3009 \u00b1 67 selected signal events the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c6(1020)\u03b7 has been measured with the systematic uncertainty of 5.1%. The obtained cross section has been used to calculate the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc (E < 1.8 GeV) = (0.321 \u00b1 0.015 stat \u00b1 0.016 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , a \u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc (E < 2.0 GeV) = (0.440 \u00b1 0.015 stat \u00b1 0.022 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . From the e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c6(1020)\u03b7 cross section approximation the \u03c6(1680) meson parameters have been determined with precision comparable or better than in previous measurements.",
