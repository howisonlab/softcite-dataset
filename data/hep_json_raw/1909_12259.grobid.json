            "text": "Jet production in high energy proton-proton (p + p) collisions is dominated by hard QCD subprocesses such as gluon-gluon and quark-gluon scatterings. Therefore p + p is an effective tool to probe the internal distribution of gluons in the proton. The STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is using longitudinally polarized p + p collisions at the center of mass energies, \u221a s = 200 and 510 GeV, to study the cross-section and double spin asymmetries, A LL , of inclusive jet and di-jet production. The measurements at \u221a s = 200 GeV showed that the jet cross-sections are well described by the next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations after underlying event and hadronization corrections. The previous 2009 \u221a s = 200 GeV inclusive jet asymmetry A LL measurement at pseudo-rapidity |\u03b7| < 1.0 showed the first experimental evidence of a non-zero gluon polarization for partonic momentum fraction, x > 0.05. The inclusive jet A LL measurement at \u221a s = 510 GeV allows to explore the gluon polarization to smaller x \u223c 0.02. The 2012 inclusive jet A LL and cross-section measurements at \u221a s = 510 GeV, the techniques used in the jet analysis including underlying event correction, and future perspectives related to jet measurements at STAR will be presented.",

            "text": "In high energy p + p collisions, parton scatterings through hard QCD processes produce a group of collimated energetic particles, so called jets. At the RHIC kinematics, the gluon-gluon (gg) and quark-gluon (qg) processes dominate the jet production over the quark-quark (qq) process, see Figure 1  [1]. Therefore the STAR experiment measures jets to gain more detailed insights into the gluon distribution inside the proton. RHIC is a 2.4 mile circular collider capable of colliding both transversely and longitudinally polarized proton beams up to the center of mass energy of \u221a s = 510 GeV. The featured detectors at STAR include the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC), and the Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC). The TPC is the major tracking system to measure charged particles in the acceptance \u22121.3 < \u03b7 < 1.3 and 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0. Both BEMC and EEMC are made of lead-scintillator stacks with full azimuthal coverage and psuedorapdity coverage, \u22121.0 < \u03b7 < 1.0 and 1.1 < \u03b7 < 2.0, respectively. They are also divided into multiple 1 \u00d7 1 jet patches in \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 space for triggering on high energy jet events. The Vertex Position Detector (VPD), Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) and Beam Beam Counter (BBC) are used for relative luminosity measurements [2].",

The STAR 2009 inclusive jet A LL at \u221a s = 200 GeV provided the first evidence of positive gluon polarization at x > 0.05 [3,4,5]. At higher \u221a s = 510 GeV, the inclusive jet A LL will constrain the gluon polarization at lower x \u223c 0.02.

A technique of applying underlying event corrections to the jet transverse momentum, p T , adapted from the ALICE experiment [9], is used in the recent STAR jet analyses. The underlying event energy density is obtained from the average energy density,\u03c1, deposited in the two off-axis cones centered at the same \u03b7 of the jet, but \u00b1 \u03c0 2 away from the jet in the azimuthal direction, thus named off-axis method, see Figure 2. The jet transverse momentum correction, d p T , is taken as the average cone density,\u03c1, times the jet area, A. This procedure allows to remove underlying event contribution on a jet-by-jet basis and to sample the \u03b7 dependence of the underlying event contribution. Furthermore it permits to study the spin-dependence of the underlying event contribution to the jet in longitudinally polarized p + p collisions. An underlying event correction d p T asymmetry is defined as,",
