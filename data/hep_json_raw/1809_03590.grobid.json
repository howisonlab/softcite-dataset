            "text": "In the standard model (SM), the fermions receive mass via their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9], and measurements of the Higgs boson branching fractions to fermions directly probe these couplings. The Higgs boson decay to a \u03c4 lepton pair is particularly interesting because it has the largest branching fraction among the direct leptonic Higgs boson decays (B(H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) 6.3%). Many searches for the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process have been performed by earlier experiments [10][11][12][13][14][15]. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations each previously reported evidence for this particular Higgs boson decay process using data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV [16][17][18]. The H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process was measured targeting the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes using data collected by the CMS Collaboration at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV [19] resulting in a cross section times branching fraction of 1.09 +0.27 \u22120.26 relative to the SM expectation. This paper reports on a search for the SM Higgs boson produced in association with a W or a Z boson. The Higgs boson is sought in its decay to a pair of \u03c4 leptons. The search is based on a data set of proton-proton (pp) collisions, collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The results are combined with prior results from the CMS H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 analysis performed with the same data set and focusing on the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes [19]. This combination provides dedicated signal JHEP06 (2019)093regions covering the four leading Higgs boson production mechanisms: gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, W associated production, and Z associated production.",

For the WH channel, four final states are considered, with the W boson decaying leptonically to a neutrino and an electron or a muon (listed first in the following notation), and the Higgs boson decaying to at least one \u03c4 h (listed second): \u00b5+\u00b5\u03c4 h , e+\u00b5\u03c4 h /\u00b5+e\u03c4 h , e+\u03c4 h \u03c4 h , and \u00b5+\u03c4 h \u03c4 h . The final state with an electron, a muon, and a \u03c4 h candidate is written as e + \u00b5\u03c4 h /\u00b5 + e\u03c4 h to make clear which light lepton is attributed to the W boson and which to the Higgs boson. The e+e\u03c4 h final state is not considered because of the lower acceptance and efficiency for electrons with respect to muons. Throughout the paper neutrinos are omitted from the notation of the final states.",

Within the solenoid volume there are: a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). Each of these is composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward hadron calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gasionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [20].

The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) is NNPDF3.0 [28]. Because the analysis focuses on measuring the WH and ZH processes, the ttH process is included as a background. The contribution from Higgs boson events produced via gluon fusion or vector boson fusion is negligible in this analysis. This is because the studied final states, when counting both leptonically and hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons, all include three or four charged lepton candidates. The transverse momentum (p T ) distribution of the Higgs boson in the powheg simulations is tuned to match closely the next-to-NLO (NNLO) plus next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic prediction in the HRes 2.3 generator [29,30].

The sum neutral p T represents a similar quantity for JHEP06(2019)093 neutral particles. The contribution of photons and neutral hadrons originating from pileup vertices is estimated from the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of charged hadrons in the cone originating from pileup vertices, charged, PU p T . This sum is multiplied by a factor of 1/2, which corresponds approximately to the ratio of neutral to charged hadron production in the hadronization process of inelastic pp collisions, as estimated from simulation.

It is based on the clustering of neutral and charged PF candidates with a distance parameter of 0.4. Charged PF candidates not associated with the primary vertex of the interaction are not considered when clustering. The combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) algorithm is used to identify jets that are likely to have originated from a bottom quark (\"b jets\") [46]. The algorithm exploits the track-based lifetime information together with the secondary vertices associated with the jet using a multivariate technique to produce a discriminator for b jet identification. A set of p T -dependent correction factors are applied as weights to simulated events to account for differences in the b tagging efficiency between data and simulation [46]. The working point chosen in this analysis gives an identification efficiency for genuine b jets of about 70% and a misidentification probability for light flavor or gluon jets of about 1%. All events with a b-tagged jet are discarded from this analysis. This selection requirement suppresses the contributions of tt, tt + W, and tt + Z with minimal impact to the signal selection efficiency. Hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons are reconstructed with the hadron-plus-strips (HPS) algorithm [47,48], which is seeded from anti-k T jets. The HPS algorithm reconstructs \u03c4 h candidates on the basis of the number of tracks and on the number of ECAL strips with an energy deposit in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, in the 1-prong, 1-prong + \u03c0 0 , and 3-prong decay modes. A multivariate analysis (MVA) discriminator [49], including isolation and lifetime information, is used to reduce the rate for quark-and gluon-initiated jets to be identified as \u03c4 h candidates. The three working points used in this analysis have efficiencies of about 55, 60, and 65% for genuine \u03c4 h , with about 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5% misidentification rates for quarkand gluon-initiated jets, within a p T range typical of a \u03c4 h originating from a Z boson. The first working point is used in the + \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channels of WH for the \u03c4 h that has the same charge as the electron or muon, while the third working point is used for the \u03c4 h that has the opposite charge. The second working point is used in the WH channels with exactly one \u03c4 h . The third working point is used for all \u03c4 h in the ZH channels. Electrons misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates are suppressed using a second MVA discriminator that includes tracker and calorimeter information [48]. Muons misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates are suppressed using additional cut-based criteria requiring energy and momentum consistency between the measurements in the tracker and the calorimeters, and requiring no more than one segment in the muon detectors [47]. The working points of these discriminators are specific JHEP06 (2019)093to each decay channel. The \u03c4 h energy in simulation is corrected for each decay mode on the basis of a measurement of the \u03c4 h energy scale in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. The rate and the energy of electrons and muons misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates are also corrected in simulation on the basis of a \"tag-and-probe\" measurement [50] in Z \u2192 events.",

The combination -14 -  Other\" includes events from triboson, tt + W/Z, ttH production, and all production modes leading to H \u2192 WW and H \u2192 ZZ decays. In these distribution the WH, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 processes contributes 91-93% of the total of VH, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 . leads to an observed significance of 5.5 standard deviations (4.8 expected). The best fit signal strength for the combination is \u00b5 = 1.24 +0.29 \u22120.27 (1.00 +0.24 \u22120.23 expected). The signal regions used in the combination target the four leading Higgs boson production mechanisms allowing extraction of the Higgs boson signal strength per production mechanism. The production mode specific signal strength measurements are shown in figure 6. This combination places a tighter constraint on the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 process in the (\u03ba V ,\u03ba f ) Higgs boson couplings parameter space than previous analyses targeting exclusively the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay process. The coupling parameters \u03ba V and \u03ba f quantify, respectively, the ratio -15 -  between the measured and the SM expected values for the couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons and to fermions, with the methods described in ref. [18]. Constraints are set with a likelihood scan that is performed for m H = 125 GeV in the (\u03ba V ,\u03ba f ) parameter space. For this scan only, Higgs boson decays to pairs of W or Z bosons, H \u2192 WW or H \u2192 ZZ, are considered as part of the signal. All nuisance parameters are profiled for each point of the scan. As shown in figure 7, the observed likelihood contour is consistent with the SM expectations of \u03ba V and \u03ba f equal to unity providing increased confidence that the Higgs boson couples to \u03c4 leptons through a Yukawa coupling as predicted in the SM. The addition of the WH and ZH targeted final states brings roughly a 10% reduction in the maximum extent of the 68% CL for \u03ba V compared to the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion targeted analysis.",
