The particle identification of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) are based on the specific energy loss per unit path length of a particle which depends for a given momentum only on its charge and rest mass. Thus, the simultaneous measurement of track momentum (or rigidity) and signal amplitude in a sensitive detector volume allows to identify particles. The measured mean energy deposit of a track is denoted as dE/dx hereafter. In practice, it can be described with parameterizations of the well-known Bethe-Bloch formula.",

The momenta of these tracks are high enough to reach the Time-Of-Flight detector (TOF) which is used to measure the particle's velocity and, with a momentum measurement, to determine its mass. The reach of the hadron identification can be extended by the detection of Cherenkov radiation in the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) and a statistical analysis of the dE/dx measurement on the relativistic rise in the TPC. High momenta electrons are identified via the detection of transition radiation. In the following section, the relevant PID detectors in the central barrel and their performance are described in increasing distance from the beam pipe.",

In practice, for detectors with a Gaussian response function this distance is usually specified in multiples of the resolution (so called n\u03c3-cuts). These methods also find their application in indirect applications of particle identification, especially the removal of background in invariant mass analyses. The use of 3\u03c3-cuts leads in many cases to a significant rejection of background without loss of efficiency. For the direct extraction of spectra, statistical unfolding methods can be applied in regions of only limited separation. The p t -reach of identified hadron spectra is further extended using the relativistic rise in the ionization measurement of the TPC.",

There, different strategies are followed by the individual detector projects: in the ITS and stand-alone TOF analysis, the distribution of the response function for tracks within |y| < 0.5 is sliced in bins of p t and fitted with a superposition of Gaussian-like functions, to extract the yield of the different species following a statistical approach allowing a maximum p t -coverage of the individual detectors. The combined TPC-TOF analysis is based on a 3\u03c3-cut in the TPC at lower and in the TOF towards intermediate momenta where track-by-track PID is still possible. This allows to histogram the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex for each particle type. The raw yield of primary and secondary particles from weak decay or interaction with the detector material is then directly extracted via a fit of the corresponding Monte Carlo templates. Figure 2 shows the combined pion spectrum of the different analyses.  The ALICE experiment also observed four candidates of the 4 He-nucleus, the measurement of which was recently published by the STAR collaboration [6]. In total, 17.8 million nuclear collisions recorded in the heavy ion run of November 2010 were analyzed with an offline trigger selecting all 3 He-nuclei or heavier. Figure 3 (right) shows the dE/dx versus rigidity distribution for negative particles in the region where the bands of 3 He and 4 He are clearly visible. Below a rigidity of p/z \u2248 2.2 GeV/c two candidates are clearly identified only based on the dE/dx information.
