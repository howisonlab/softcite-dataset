Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors.

            "text": "A number of systematic uncertainties affecting the determination of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S CP observables and the ratio of event yields R are considered. The main sources of systematic uncertainty are due to assumptions for modelling the different components of the multivariate PDF. These uncertainties are estimated using large sets of simulated pseudoexperiments, in which the shapes and parameters of the individual PDF components are varied. In the generation of the pseudoexperiments, the values of the parameters are fixed to the ones obtained in the fit to the data. For each individual pseudoexperiment, the fitted values of the CP observables and event yields are compared between the nominal fit and an alternative fit in which some of the shapes or nuisance parameters are varied. The resulting differences between the fit values form a Gaussian-like distribution. The mean and width of this distribution are added in quadrature and assigned as a systematic uncertainty. Following this strategy, the systematic uncertainty due to the chosen mass model is evaluated by varying the Hypatia tail parameters within their uncertainties, replacing the signal model with a double Crystal Ball function [40], and replacing the background model with a second-order Chebychev polynomial. The latter variation has the largest impact on the CP observables and yield ratio, and is used to assign a systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty associated with the decay time resolution is evaluated by varying the dilution of the resolution model, through changes of the resolution parameters, and by comparing the nominal model with one that includes a scale offset in the calibration functions for the per-candidate decay time uncertainty estimates. The largest impact on the CP observables and yield ratio originates from the limited knowledge on the decay time resolution of the long K 0 S sample. This forms the dominant systematic uncertainty to the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S CP observables. Systematic effects due to the modelling of the decay time acceptance mainly affect A \u2206\u0393 , and are evaluated by varying the empirical model for E(t).",
