            "text": "The theoretical description of D + s mesons is problematic because, unlike D mesons, the masses and widths of the D * s0 (2317) + and D s1 (2460) + states [1][2][3][4][5][6] are not in agreement with potential model calculations based on HQET [7]. Theoretical explanations for the discrepancy invoke D ( * ) K molecules [8], chiral partners [9,10], unitarized chiral models [11,12], tetraquarks [13,14], and lattice calculations [15,16], but a satisfactory description is still lacking (see [17,18] for more details). Improved measurements of the D + s1 meson parameters can lead to a better understanding of these states. In this analysis a precise measurement of the D s1 (2536) + mass and decay width is performed based on a high statistics data sample [19]. The D s1 (2536) + meson, referred to as the D + s1 below, was first seen in cc-continuum reactions [20], and more recently in B decays. The current world average mass value published by the Particle Data Group is based on measurements with large statistical and systematic uncertainties: 2535.29 \u00b1 0.20 MeV/c 2 [21]; the mass difference between the D + s1 and the D * + meson has been measured to be 525.04 \u00b1 0.22 MeV/c 2 [21]. An upper limit on the decay width (\u0393 < 2.3 MeV at 90% confidence level), and a measurement of the spin-parity of the D + s1 meson (J P = 1 + ), have been obtained, but based on low-statistics data samples only [21][22][23]. The mixing between the D + s1 meson and the other J P = 1 + state D s1 (2460) + was investigated in Ref. [24].",

For the reconstructed K 0 S and D 0 masses from the test data samples (see Sec. IV), a sine-like dependence on the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is observed. This effect was also observed in a previous BABAR analysis and might be related to the internal alignment of the DCH [33]. For a detailed study, the same \u03c6dependence is introduced into the signal MC samples by modifying the kaon and pion track momenta accordingly. Due to symmetry, the effect disappears when all \u03c6 angles are taken into account, but as a conservative estimate the amplitude of the sine-like shift on the reconstructed D + s1 mass in MC (13 (14) keV/c 2 for K4\u03c0 (K6\u03c0)) is taken as a systematic error for \u2206m(D + s1 ) 0 .",

A signal window of \u00b16 MeV/c 2 around the fitted mean mass of 497.2 MeV/c 2 is selected for both decay modes.In the case of an event with multiple candidates, the candidate with the best fit probability is chosen.

Using a slightly different method for the combination of the individual results [4], a value of m(D + s1 ) = 2535.08 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.15 MeV/c 2 is obtained, where the first error denotes the statistical and the second the systematic uncertainty.

The corrections of \u221251 (\u221245) keV for the K4\u03c0 (K6\u03c0) decay mode, based on the systematic resolution studies (Sec. VIII A), are applied prior to the combination process. X. SUMMARY In this paper, precision measurements of the mass and decay width of the charmed-strange meson D s1 (2536) + via the decay D + s1 \u2192 D * + K 0 S are presented. Two decay modes are analyzed, with the D 0 that originates from the D * + decaying either through K \u2212 \u03c0 + or K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The results include the first significant measurement of the total decay width of the D + s1 . This width is determined to be \u0393(D + s1 ) = 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.04 MeV, compared to the 90% confidence level upper limit of 2.3 MeV given in Ref. [21]. The mass of the D s1 (2536) + is measured to be m(D + s1 ) = 2535.08 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.15 MeV/c 2 , and the D + s1 \u2212 D * + mass difference to be m(D + s1 ) \u2212 m(D * + ) = 524.83 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.04 MeV/c 2 .",
