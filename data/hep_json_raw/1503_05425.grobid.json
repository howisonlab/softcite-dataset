            "text": "A search has been performed for pair production of heavy vectorlike down-type (B) quarks. The analysis explores the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterized by events with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon), significant missing transverse momentum, and multiple jets. One or more jets are required to be tagged as arising from b quarks, and at least one pair of jets must be tagged as arising from the hadronic decay of an electroweak boson. The analysis uses the full data sample of pp collisions recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, operating at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . No significant excess of events is observed above the expected background. Limits are set on vectorlike B production, as a function of the B branching ratios, assuming the allowable decay modes are B \u2192 Wt=Zb=Hb. In the chiral limit with a branching ratio of 100% for the decay B \u2192 Wt, the observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the vectorlike B mass is 810 GeV (760 GeV). In the case where the vectorlike B quark has branching ratio values corresponding to those of an SU\u00f02\u00de singlet state, the observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the vectorlike B mass is 640 GeV (505 GeV). The same analysis, when used to investigate pair production of a colored, charge 5=3 exotic fermion T 5=3 , with subsequent decay T 5=3 \u2192 Wt, sets an observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the T 5=3 mass of 840 GeV (780 GeV).",

            "text": "The recent discovery [15,16] of a Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV has modified rather than eliminated expectations for additional quarks. SM-like \"sequential\" fourth-generation quarks are disfavored, though not completely excluded [17][18][19][20]. On the other hand, so-called \"vectorlike\" quarks (VLQs), for which both the leftand right-handed fields transform identically under the SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de gauge transformations [21], remain viable. Indeed, VLQs could play a role in stabilizing the electroweak vacuum in light of the observed Higgs mass [22]. In contrast to sequential chiral quarks, VLQs neither acquire mass through electroweak symmetry breaking nor modify precision electroweak observables significantly. Another distinguishing feature is that VLQs can have large flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decay rates. For instance, whereas a heavy new chiral down-type quark (d 4 ) would decay predominantly via d 4 \u2192 Wt, a vectorlike down-type quark of charge \u22121=3 (denoted hereafter by B) could decay via B \u2192 Zb and B \u2192 Hb, in addition to via B \u2192 Wt. Likewise, a vectorlike up-type quark of charge 2=3 (denoted by T) could decay not only via T \u2192 Wb but also via T \u2192 Zt and T \u2192 Ht. The values of the VLQ B and VLQ T branching ratios are determined by the VLQ multiplet structure and effects such as the VLQ mixing with SM quarks [21,23]. It is usually assumed that new heavy quarks of either type would couple primarily to the third generation of SM quarks, for instance in order to suppress FCNC interactions among the SM quarks [24], but couplings to lighter generations are not excluded [25,26].",

This article presents a search for VLQ B pair production, using the full data set of proton-proton (pp) collision events at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. The analysis explores the leptonplus-jets final state, characterized by events with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon), significant missing transverse momentum (the magnitude of which is referred to as E miss T ), and multiple jets. The main SM backgrounds to this signature are events with production of a top quark and antitop quark (tt) and events with a W boson produced in association with jets (W \u00fe jets). The analysis requires that one or more jets are tagged as arising from b quarks and that at least one pair of jets is tagged as arising from the hadronic decay of an electroweak boson. These requirements are designed primarily to address the signature BB \u2192 W \u00fe W \u2212 tt \u2192 W \u00fe W \u2212 W \u00fe W \u2212 bb but also to retain sensitivity to other VLQ B (and T) decay signatures. In addition, since the analysis does not distinguish the charges of the hadronically decaying W bosons, it also has sensitivity to pair production of a colored charge 5=3 exotic fermion, denoted by T 5=3 , that decays via T 5=3 \u2192 Wt to a W boson and top quark of the same charge sign. The T 5=3 is predicted, for example, in some composite Higgs models [11].",

VLQ B masses were set to values from 350 to 850 GeV in 50 GeV steps. Production cross sections were normalized using predictions from TOP \u00fe \u00fe [37,38] (version 2.0) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD with resummed next-to-next-toleading-logarithm (NNLL) soft gluon terms and MSTW2008 NNLO PDFs [36,39]. Branching ratios to Wt, Zb, and Hb were set to 1=3 each; alternative branching ratio values were investigated by reweighting MC events according to generator-level information. For example, the SU(2) singlet point corresponds to a branching ratio to Wt between 32% and 47% (increasing with the mass of the B) and to Hb between 26% and 29% (decreasing with the mass of the B), over the mass range considered in this analysis. Events for a few mass points (400, 600, and 800 GeV) were passed through a GEANT4-based detector simulation [40,41]. Further mass points were simulated using a faster simulation [42] but validated at the above mass points with the GEANT4-based simulation. Kinematically similar chiral d 4 samples, at mass values from 400 GeV to 1 TeV, in 50 GeV steps, were generated with PYTHIA [34] and also passed through fast detector simulation and were used to bolster samples of simulated decays of VLQ B to Wt. All MC samples were reconstructed using the same algorithms used for the data.",

            "text": "Tables II, III, and IV list the sources of systematic uncertainty considered in this analysis. The different effects change both the size and shape of the signal and background contributions to the discriminant distribution; the tables show the overall effect on the expected numbers in the BDT SR. Table II lists those uncertainties that affect all the samples. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity, to which all non-data-driven samples are normalized, is 2.8% [88]. The jet energy resolution is measured by studying dijet events in data and simulation. The simulation is found to agree with data to better than 10% [89]; the difference in resolutions between data and simulation is used to further smear the simulation. The effect of this additional smearing  Data/Bkg 0.5  is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The largest uncertainty arises from the jet energy scale (JES), which is varied in simulation by amounts derived from test beam and Z=\u03b3 \u00fe jet collision data along with simulation [72,73]. The jet reconstruction efficiency is estimated using track-based jets, and is well described by data, with the effect of small (approximately 0.2%) differences for jets below 30 GeV assessed by discarding randomly selected jets in simulated events. The effect of the JVF requirement is evaluated in data using events with a Z boson produced in association with a single jet. The lepton identification uncertainties include those on the electron energy and muon momentum scale and resolution and trigger efficiencies, evaluated in data using leptonic decays of W and Z bosons [68][69][70]. The systematic uncertainties on the E miss T reconstruction include the uncertainties on the constituent objects, as well as an additional uncertainty on the unclustered energy originating mainly from the pileup modeling. Finally, the tagging efficiency of b jets, as well as of c jets and light-flavor jets, is derived from data and parametrized as a function of jet p T and \u03b7 [90,91]. The corresponding efficiencies in simulation are corrected to match those observed in data, and the uncertainties in the calibration are propagated through this analysis. Table III summarizes systematic uncertainties related to reweighting the POWHEG-BOX tt simulation for better agreement with data. As noted in Sec. VII C, the reweighting improves agreement in the control regions TCR1-TCR3, especially in the H T variable. The largest uncertainties in the measurement of top quark and tt p T are taken as   independent contributions to the systematic uncertainty. Of these, the largest contribution arises from the modeling of initial-and final-state radiation. The uncertainty due to PDF choice on the acceptance is estimated by comparing tt events generated with the HERAPDF 1.5 NLO PDF set [92] with those using the nominal CT10 PDFs. The uncertainty due to the choice of the parton shower model is estimated by replacing PYTHIA with HERWIG [93] (version 6.520) in the tt simulation. For both uncertainties, the comparison samples are corrected to match top-quark p T and tt p T distributions in data, as done with the nominal simulation. In addition, the POWHEG-BOX \u00fe PYTHIA sample is compared with a p T -reweighted ALPGEN (version 2.14) sample, with HERWIG parton showering, to check its behavior at high jet multiplicity, and is found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties.",

Figure 9 shows, for a variety of VLQ B mass values, the observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusions of the BDT analysis. The results are shown in terms of the decay branching ratios, with BR\u00f0B \u2192 Hb\u00de plotted on the vertical axis and BR\u00f0B \u2192 Wt\u00de on the horizontal axis. Superimposed on Fig. 9 are two particular benchmark models, the case discussed above where the VLQ B is an SU\u00f02\u00de singlet (shown as a filled circle) and the case where it is part of a \u00f0B; Y\u00de SU\u00f02\u00de doublet (shown as a star).

Therefore, the BDT analysis, which was trained using chiral heavyquark signal samples, can be simply applied to the investigation of pair production of the T 5=3 .

The analysis explores the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterized by events with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon), significant missing transverse momentum, and multiple jets. One or more jets are required to be tagged as arising from b quarks and that at least one pair of jets is tagged as arising from the hadronic decay of an electroweak boson. The analysis finds no significant excess above the expectations for Standard Model backgrounds. Limits are set on VLQ B production, as a function of its branching ratios, assuming the allowable decay modes are B \u2192 Wt=Zb=Hb. For a branching ratio of 100% for the decay B \u2192 Wt, the observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the VLQ B mass is 810 GeV (760 GeV). In the specific case where the VLQ B has branching ratios corresponding to those of an SU\u00f02\u00de singlet state, the observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the VLQ B mass is 640 GeV (505 GeV). The same analysis also investigates pair production of a colored, charge 5=3 exotic fermion T 5=3 , with subsequent decay T 5=3 \u2192 Wt, and sets an observed (expected) 95% C.L. lower limit on the T 5=3 mass of 840 GeV (780 GeV).",
