This prediction is tested by measuring the mass difference between the top quark and antiquark ( m t = m t \u2212 m t ) that are produced in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, using events with a muon or an electron and at least four jets in the final state. The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, and yields a value of m t = \u22120.15 \u00b1 0.19 (stat) \u00b1 0.09 (syst) GeV, which is consistent with the SM expectation. This result is significantly more precise than previously reported measurements.",

            "text": "Symmetries such as charge conjugation (C), parity or space reflection (P), and time reversal (T) play a fundamental role in the standard model (SM) of particle physics [1][2][3]. The invariance of the SM under their combination, the CPT symmetry, predicts equality of particle and antiparticle masses, and thus far experiments have confirmed this prediction [4]. In some extensions of the SM, however, CPT-violating effects are present [5][6][7][8]. The large number of top quarks produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC provides an opportunity to test CPT symmetry in the quark sector for the most massive particle of the SM through a precise measurement of the difference in mass between the top quark (t) and its antiparticle (t), m t \u2261 m t \u2212 m t .",

However, the subsequent measurements by D0, CMS, CDF, and ATLAS, yielding 0.8 \u00b1 1.8 (stat) \u00b1 0.5 (syst) GeV [10], \u22120.44 \u00b1 0.46 (stat) \u00b1 0.27 (syst) GeV [11], \u22121.95 \u00b1 1.11 (stat) \u00b1 0.59 (syst) GeV [12], and 0.67 \u00b1 0.61 (stat) \u00b1 0.41 (syst) GeV [13], respectively, are all in agreement with CPT symmetry.

It rep-E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. resents the first determination of m t at \u221a s = 8 TeV. While the same techniques as for the previous m t measurement by CMS [11] are used, both the statistical and the systematic uncertainty are significantly reduced. The event selection is optimized for tt production where one of the W bosons decays hadronically (t \u2192 bW + \u2192 bqq , or its charge conjugate) and the other decays leptonically (t \u2192 bW + \u2192 b + \u03bd , or its charge conjugate), with corresponding to either an electron or a muon (including also decays to \u03c4 leptons where the \u03c4 decays leptonically). The data are split into \u2212 and + samples that contain three-jet decays of the associated top quarks or antiquarks, respectively. For each event category, the ideogram likelihood method [15] is used to measure m t and m t , from which their difference is obtained.",

In the region of |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity and 0.087 rad in azimuth (\u03c6). In the (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane, for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto arrays of 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystals to form calorimeter towers that project radially outwards from near the center of the CMS detector. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. The energy resolution is less than 5% for the electron energies considered in this analysis [17,18]. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry.

Reconstructed charged particles from the primary collision vertex, with the exception of isolated electrons and muons, and all neutral particles are used for jet clustering. Jets are formed using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [33] with a distance parameter of 0.5. The momentum of a jet, determined from the vectorial sum of the momenta of all particles within a jet, is found from simulation to lie typically within 5-10% of the true jet momentum. Jet energies are corrected for contributions from additional pileup interactions expected within the area of the jet. Afterwards, simulation-based p T -and \u03b7-dependent jet energy scale corrections are applied to all jets both in the data and simulation [34]. Through these means, a uniform energy response is achieved at the reconstructed particle level with only weak pileup dependence. Jets in the data have an additional residual correction that is determined by assuming momentum balance Expected and observed yield of events passing the full selection of e + + jets, e \u2212 + jets, \u03bc + + jets, and \u03bc \u2212 + jets channels. Simulations are used to obtain the expected number of events except for the QCD multijet background, which is derived from data, as described in the text. The uncertainties on the event numbers are statistical and reflect the limited number of events in simulation or data for the individual processes. in dijet, photon + jet, and Z + jet events. The jet energy resolution is measured in the data to be about 10% worse than in simulation [34] which is corrected by smearing the jet energy in simulated events by the corresponding amount. The amount of missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) is calculated as the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles [35]. The effect of jet energy scale corrections on the jet momenta is propagated to E miss T . A particle-based relative isolation is computed for each lepton and is corrected on an event-by-event basis for contributions from pileup events [36]. The scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particle candidates, except for the leptons themselves, within a cone of  [37,38] which combines the information from reconstructed secondary vertices and from displaced tracks within the jets to form a multi-variant discriminator output. It is tuned such that its efficiency to tag b jets is about 68% and the rate of mistagging light-flavor, gluon, and c jets is about 4% for jets within the considered p T range, as evaluated using the nominal tt simulation. Each event is required to have at least one b-tagged jet. An additional event selection requirement based on the \u03c7 2 of a kinematic fit to the tt hypothesis described in Section 5 is also applied in the analysis. The number of events observed in the data and the corresponding predictions from simulated events and from data control regions (for the QCD multijet background) are shown in Table 1 separately for e + + jets, e \u2212 + jets, \u03bc + + jets, and \u03bc \u2212 + jets events. The fraction of QCD multijet events is estimated with a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the E miss T distribution observed in the data, separately in the e + jets and \u03bc + jets channels. The mass shape for the QCD multijet background is obtained from the data by using a dedicated sample of events where the isolation and identification criteria (for e + jets) or the isolation criterion alone (for \u03bc + jets) have been inverted. A difference of less than 6% is found between the observed and expected total yields. Differences between the data and expectation in the overall yield do not affect this analysis directly, unlike possible differences in the kinematic properties of the events or in the relative fractions of the yields of the various processes. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the transverse momenta of the four leading jets in each event for both the + + jets and the \u2212 + jets samples. The overall number of simulated events is normalized to the event yield observed in the data, while keeping their relative fractions fixed to the prediction. In general, the data appear to be well modeled by the simulation, except for a small but statistically significant deviation in the jet transverse momenta, visible as a slope in the ratio plots. This is related to the modeling of the top quark transverse momentum in the simulation, which is known to predict a slightly harder spectrum than observed in data [39][40][41]. The effect on the top quark mass measurement is approximately 100 MeV, as measured in an equivalent analysis in the + jets channel [42]. As it identically affects the + + jets and \u2212 + jets samples, the impact on the m t measurement is negligible.",

However, before carrying out the fit, additional corrections are applied to the data and simulation in order to correct jet energies to the parton level. These corrections are derived separately for jets associated with hadronic W boson decays and for b jets in bins of p T and |\u03b7| of these jets by comparing the transverse energy of reconstructed jets with that of the corresponding generated partons in simulated tt events. Only solutions for which the kinematic fit returns a \u03c7 2 /n dof < 10 are accepted, where n dof i between the data and expectation is given in Fig. 2, for the jet combination with the smallest overall \u03c7 2 in each event. Agreement is observed between the data and expectation. In the ideogram method [15], an approximate event-by-event likelihood model is constructed as a function of m t . This likelihood contains a signal and a background term. The signal part is a weighted sum over all combinations of jets, containing two terms: a correct jet-to-quark assignment term and a wrong jet-to-quark assignment term. The shapes of the background term and the wrong jet-to-quark assignment term are both taken from simulation, which represents our best knowledge of the kinematic properties of the events. The correct jet-to-quark assignment term, on the other hand, is defined by the convolution of a Gaussian resolution function and a relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution. The Gaussian function has a width equal to the uncertainty \u03c3 i resulting from the kinematic fit for the given combination of jets. The weights applied in the sum over jet combinations are calculated for each combination using the \u03c7 2 i of the kinematic fit and the compatibility of the b jet assignments, calculated from the known b tagging efficiency and mistagging rate. The reweighting significantly reduces the contribution of combinations for which the b jet assignments are highly incompatible with the results of the b tagging algorithm and of combinations that badly fulfill the mass constraints. The combined likelihood for the full event sample is calculated as the product of the individual event likelihoods for all selected events. The fitted top quark mass and its statistical uncertainty are extracted from this combined likelihood. More details about the exact implementation of the kinematic fit and the ideogram method can be found in Ref. [11]. The event likelihoods are calculated under certain assumptions and simplifications and hence the result of the combination is first calibrated using pseudo-experiments where the mass shapes are generated from the expected distributions of signal and background events. The standard deviation (width) of the pull distribution and the observed bias on the estimated top quark mass before calibration are shown as a function of the generated mass in Fig. 3. The pull is defined as pull j = (m j \u2212 m )/\u03c3 j , where m j is the estimated top quark mass in each pseudo-experiment j, \u03c3 j the corresponding statistical uncertainty, and m the mean of the estimated top quark masses over all pseudo-experiments. Since the width of the pull distribution is about 1.13, the statistical uncertainty of the final mass measurement needs to be scaled up by about 13%. The biases are within 3 GeV for most of the range of interest. The obtained top quark mass is corrected using the fitted linear function shown in Fig. 3 (right). The residual bias on the estimated top quark mass as a function of the generated top quark mass after applying this calibration is shown in Fig. 4, separately for + + jets and \u2212 + jets events. These plots demonstrate that an inclusive + jets calibration can be used for both the positive and negative channels. ",

Some systematic uncertainties related to the modeling of the physics processes are not expected to affect the m t measurement and are not considered in this analysis. These are the modeling of the hadronization, the underlying event, initial-and final-state radiation, the factorization and renormalization scales, and the matching between matrixelement and parton shower calculations. Other effects considered in the measurement of m t are included together with additional sources potentially relevant for the m t measurement, such as lepton-charge identification and a possible difference in jet energy response to b and b quarks. A summary of these effects is given in Table 2. The effects are evaluated by comparing the nominal simulation to a sample of simulated events where the source of the systematic uncertainty under study is varied within its uncertainty. Since most sources of systematic uncertainty yield only a small change in the m t measurement, statistical uncertainties on the observed changes are evaluated using a jackknife re-sampling technique [48] and the larger among the estimated change and its statistical uncertainty is quoted as the final systematic uncertainty. The total systematic uncertainty is taken to be the quadratic sum of all individual values. The uncertainties presented here are significantly smaller than those reported in Ref. [11]. All systematic uncertainties in the previous result were statistically compatible with zero and the total uncertainty A difference in the fraction of jet energy reconstructed by the detector between b and b jets can introduce a bias in the m t measurement. Such differences, caused for example by different cross sections for interactions of positively and negatively charged kaons in the calorimeter, are expected to be reduced thanks to the PF reconstruction that relies mostly on tracking to reconstruct charged hadrons. The p T of the reconstructed jets is compared with the original parton p T in two simulated tt samples: the nominal sample, generated with MadGraph with showering from pythia, and a sample generated with mc@nlo with showering from herwig. Simulated samples produced with these two sets of MC generators have been observed to encompass the data in various key observables, and differ significantly in several aspects, including the relative production and decay rates of different kinds of hadrons in the jets [49]. In both samples the ratio of b to b response as a function of jet p T is observed to be statistically compatible with unity, and an average difference of 0.078 \u00b1 0.040% is measured. When the difference of 0.078% is propagated to our nominal sample of simulated events a shift of 51 \u00b1 1 MeV is observed, which is quoted as systematic uncertainty. Signal fraction. A change in the signal fraction (as calculated from  corresponding to an absolute change of \u00b11.2% [37,38] in the b tagging efficiency produce a shift in m t of 24 \u00b1 7 MeV (\"b tagging efficiency\" in Table 2). The use of different working points for the + + jets and \u2212 + jets samples, yielding an absolute 1.2% difference in b tagging efficiency between b and b jets, produces a shift of 11 \u00b1 7 MeV (\"b versus b tagging efficiency\" in Table 2). Misassignment of lepton charge. In this analysis the leptons are only used in the trigger, in the event selection, and in the splitting of the data into + + jets and \u2212 + jets samples, but not in the mass reconstruction. A misassignment of the lepton charge can affect the calibration and it can also lead to a dilution of the measurement. For muons the charge misassignment rate is measured with cosmic muons [16] and collision data [51,52] to be of the order of 10 \u22125 to 10 \u22124 in the considered p T range. For electrons this rate ranges between 0.1% and 0.4% [51,52]. This means that the systematic uncertainty from charge misassignment is below 1% of the measured m t value, which is negligible and is therefore ignored. Trigger, lepton identification, and lepton isolation. As the trigger is based on an isolated single lepton, and the lepton is not used in the mass reconstruction, no systematic effect is expected from an uncertainty in the trigger efficiency or on the lepton energy scale. Similarly, the lepton identification and isolation are also not expected to affect the measurement.",

Background charge asymmetry. A difference in the estimated charge asymmetry of the backgrounds leads to different levels of background and to a different background composition in the + + jets and \u2212 + jets channels, which can bias the m t measurement.The measured inclusive W + /W \u2212 production ratio at 8 TeV is in agreement with theoretical predictions within a precision of 2% [51,52], but since this ratio depends on the number of jets, the uncertainty is inflated by a factor of two, yielding a variation of 4%. When the fractions of W + and W \u2212 events are varied by 2% in opposite directions, thereby affecting the relative ratio of W + and W \u2212 events by 4%, m t changes by 3.72 \u00b1 0.01 MeV. The W + jets background contains non-negligible contributions from W + cc and W + bb events, whose relative W + /W \u2212 ratio is affected by a larger uncertainty. The relative ratio is varied by 20%, which corresponds to the uncertainty in the measured inclusive W + bb production cross section [53], and yields a shift in m t of 9.05 \u00b10.02 MeV and 5.83 \u00b10.02 MeV for the W + cc and W + bb contributions, respectively. Single top quarks produced via the t channel also possess a charge asymmetry, measured to be in agreement with theory predictions within 15% [54]. Changing this charge asymmetry by a relative \u00b115% results in a shift on m t of 3.298 \u00b1 0.005 MeV. The quadratic sum of all these observed shifts is quoted as the systematic uncertainty. Background composition. Possible residual effects due to the composition of the background are evaluated by scaling each background source up and down, keeping the signal fraction fixed. A shift in m t is observed when we scale W + jets (1.3 \u00b1 0.3 MeV), Z + jets (1.99 \u00b1 0.03 MeV), t-channel single top quark production (6.9 \u00b1 0.1 MeV), and tW single top quark production (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 MeV) up/down by 30%; and when we scale QCD multijet events (26.8 \u00b1 0.",
