            "text": "The understanding of the origin of dark matter has great importance for cosmology and particle physics. Several interesting extensions of the standard model dealing with solution of this problem motivate the concept of hidden sectors consisting of SU (3) C \u00d7 SU (2) L \u00d7 U (1) Y singlet fields. Among these models, the mirror matter model is certainly one of the most interesting. The model explains the origin of parity violation in weak interactions, it could also explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and provide a natural ground for the explanation of dark matter. The mirror matter could have a portal to our world through photon-mirror photon mixing (\u03b5). This mixing would lead to orthopositronium (o \u2212 Ps) to mirror orthopositronium oscillations, the experimental signature of which is the apparently invisible decay of o \u2212 Ps. In this paper, we describe an experiment to search for the decay o \u2212 Ps \u2192 invisible in vacuum by using a pulsed slow positron beam and a massive 4\u03c0 BGO crystal calorimeter. The developed high efficiency positron tagging system, the low calorimeter energy threshold and high hermiticity allow the expected sensitivity in mixing strength to be \u03b5 \u2243 10 \u22129 , which is more than one order of magnitude below the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit and in a region of parameter space of great theoretical and phenomenological interest. The vacuum experiment with such sensitivity is particularly timely in light of the recent DAMA/LIBRA observations of the annual modulation signal consistent with a mirror type dark matter interpretation.",

In addition, the recent confirmation by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment [5] of the annual modulation signal observed by the DAMA/NaI [6] seems provide the first direct terrestrial experimental observation of the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in our galactic halo. The need to explain these hints of the presence of dark matter provides one of the strongest indications for the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and the identification of the origin of dark matter is a task of enormous importance for both particle physics and cosmology. At present, the most popular candidates for the (thermal-produced) dark matter are the so-called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are e.g. lightest supersymmetric particles, Kaluza-Klein particles in universal extra dimension models, axions etc... However, despite of significant efforts the experiments looking for WIMPs lead so far to negative results, thus, pushing further possible WIMP searches into a very high-energy and/or high sensitivity frontiers, for a recent review see e.g. [7] and references therein.",

Then the question arises: could the important sensitive searches for the hidden sectors be performed at low energy frontier ? The answer for this question is definitely positive. For example, there is a class of models with at least one additional U (1) gauge factor where the corresponding hidden gauge boson could be light, or even massless [8,9,10], for a recent review see [11]. With respect to the mass and lifetime range for hidden sector states, the niche with masses in the range of a few MeV to a few GeV, with lifetimes of less than 1 second, is also quite intriguing as many of the most severe astrophysical and cosmological constraints that apply to lighter states are weakened or eliminated, while those from high-energy colliders are often inapplicable [12].",

Certain classes of hidden sectors may be tested, but it is clear that not many generic scenarios, which are viable, could be strongly constrained and even excluded on the base of precision measurements. Among numerous candidates that have been discussed, one of the most promising, which could reconcile the DAMA annual modulation signal with the results of the CDMS II experiment, is mirror type dark matter [18,19]. In addition, the CoGeNT collaboration has recently reported a rising low energy spectrum in their ultra low noise germanium detector [20]. This is particularly interesting as the energy range probed by CoGeNT overlaps with the energy region in which DAMA has observed their annual modulation signal. It has been recently shown [21], that the mirror dark matter candidate can simultaneously explain both the DAMA annual modulation signal and the rising low energy spectrum observed by CoGeNT. This constitutes a model dependent confirmation of the DAMA signal and adds weight to the mirror dark matter paradigm.",

It should be noted that mirror baryons are naturally dark, stable and massive. Currently, it seems that this type of matter could also explain in a natural way the coincidence between visible and dark matter densities in the universe (\u2126 B = 0.044 and \u2126 DM = 0.26) [22,23]. Interestingly, it could also provide an explanation of the controversial behaviour in galaxy cluster collisions [24]. Furthermore, if mirror matter is present in our universe it would mean that Parity (spatial-inversion) is an unbroken symmetry of nature. This gives an exciting motivation for testing this model by a laboratory experiment at low energies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2.3, we review the mirror model and work out briefly the mirror Higgs boson physics at the CERN LHC, and in more details, the effect of oscillation of ordinary positronium to the mirror one and its experimental consequences. We also present the calculations we performed in order to estimate the effect of matter and external fields on the oscillation probability. In Section 3, we present the experimental technique. In Section 4, the design of the experiment and the detector components are described in detail. The simulations of the signal and background sources, as well as the expected sensitivity are discussed in Section 5 and 6, respectively. Section 7 contains concluding remarks.",

In order to save parity conservation they suggested that the transformation in the particle space corresponding to the space inversion x \u2192 \u2212x should not be the usual transformation P but PR, where R corresponds to the transformation of a particle (proton [25]) into a reflected state in the mirror particle space. After the observation of parity non-conservation, Landau assumed [27] that R=C, i.e. he suggested to identify antiparticles with the mirror matter but then CP must be conserved, which we know is not the case. The idea was further developed by A. Salam [28], and was clearly formulated in 1966 as a concept of the mirror universe by Kobzarev, Okun and Pomeranchuk [29]. In their paper, they have shown that ordinary and mirror matter can communicate predominantly through gravity and proposed that the mirror matter objects can be present in our universe.",

R-parity interchanges the ordinary particles with the mirror particles so that the properties of the mirror particles completely mirror those of the ordinary particles. For example, the mirror proton and mirror electron are stable and interact with the mirror photon in the same way in which the ordinary proton and electron interact with the ordinary photons. The mirror particles are unlikely to be produced in laboratory experiments just because they couple very weakly with the ordinary particles. In the modern language of gauge theories, the mirror particles are all singlets under the standard G \u2261 SU (3) \u2297 SU (2) L \u2297 U (1) Y gauge interactions [31].

Parity is conserved because the mirror particles experience V + A (i.e. right-handed) mirror weak interactions while the ordinary particles experience the usual V \u2212 A (i.e. left-handed) weak interactions. An exact Lagrangian Z 2 symmetry interchanging ordinary and mirror particles is hypothesized, which means that all the couplings in the mirror sector are the same as in the ordinary sector. While, the ordinary and mirror particle sectors can interact between each other in a number of ways. The first is through gravitation, with immediate consequences for the dark matter problem and astrophysics [33]. Non-gravitational interactions can be induced through the mixing of colourless and neutral particles with their mirror counterparts. Neutrinos [34], the photon [35,36,37], and the physical neutral Higgs boson [38,39] can mix with the corresponding mirror states. Coloured and/or electrically charged particles are prevented from mixing with their mirror analogues by colour and electric charge conservation laws.",

The BBN limit on the effective number of extra neutrinos implies that the temperature of the mirror sector T \u2032 must be at least about twice smaller than the temperature T of the ordinary sector allowing mirror baryons to be a viable candidate for dark matter. In particular, the mirror dark matter scenario would give the same pattern of Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure as the standard CDM if T \u2032 /T 0.2 [32,33,40]. In addition, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be generated via out-of-equilibrium B \u2212 L and CP violating processes between ordinary and mirror particles [41] whose mechanism could explain the intriguing puzzle of the correspondence between the visible and dark matter fractions in the Universe, naturally predicting the ratio \u2126 DM /\u2126 B \u2243 5 [42].",

The total decay rate of H + or H \u2212 is the same as that for a SM physical neutral Higgs boson of the same mass. This may result in dramatic consequences for the LHC, making the significance of the Higgs signal at LHC lower due to decreasing of the Signal/Background ratio if the mass splitting is large compared to the Higgs mass resolution at the LHC. Note also that each mass eigenstate couples to ordinary particles with strength reduced by 1/2 compared to the coupling of the standard Higgs boson to those same particles [38]. Double Higgs peak observation for Eq. (2.5), would give a clear and interesting signature for the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) which could thus establish the existence of the mirror world. However, for this effect to be observable the mass difference between the two eigenstates must be sufficiently large. The cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the mass difference parameter have been studied in [38]. To summarize, one can see that the Higgs sector may play an important role in detecting mirror particles, which can be the candidates of dark matter and appear as missing energy in the detectors at the LHC [38,39]. Another intriguing possibility discussed in the next Sec. is related to the possible observation of orthopositronium to mirror orthopositronium oscillations.",

            "text": "Positronium (Ps), the positron-electron bound state, is the lightest known atom, which is bounded and self-annihilates through the same, electromagnetic interaction. At the current level of experimental and theoretical precision this is the only interaction present in this system [43]. This feature has made positronium an ideal system for testing the accuracy of QED calculations for bound states, in particular for the triplet (1 3 S 1 ) state of Ps, orthopositronium (o \u2212 Ps). Due to the odd-parity under C-transformation, o \u2212 Ps decays predominantly into three photons. Due to the phase-space and additional \u03b1 suppression factors, as compared with the singlet (1 1 S 0 ) state (para-positronium), the \"slowness\" of o \u2212 Ps decay rate gives an enhancement factor \u2243 10 3 in sensitivity to an admixture of new interactions which are not accommodated in the Standard Model [44,45]. Glashow realized that the orthopositronium system provides one sensitive way to search for the mirror matter [35]. Glashow's idea is that if a small kinetic mixing between ordinary and mirror photons exists [9], it would mix ordinary and mirror orthopositronium, leading to maximal orthopositronium -mirror orthopositronium oscillations (see Fig. 1). Since mirror o-Ps' decays predominantly into three mirror photons these oscillations would result in o \u2212 Ps \u2192 invisible decays in vacuum. Photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing is described by the interaction Lagrangian density",

Mirror matter is a promising candidate for dark matter since it can reconcile the null results from the other higher threshold experiments like CDMS/Si [54] and XENON10 [55]. Interestingly, this value of \u03b5 is also consistent with all other known experimental and cosmological bounds, including SN1987a 2 and the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound [58]. It was also confirmed that photonmirror photon mixing of this magnitude is consistent as well with the more stringent constraints from cosmic microwave background measurements and large scale structure considerations [59]. It is also in the range of naturally small \u03b5-values motivated by grand unification models [22]. If \u03b5 is as large as in Eq.

The secondary electrons are then transported in the backward direction by the same magnetic field, which guides the positrons. The two operation modes described above can be combined. This is done by studying the delay between the detection of the SE at the MCP with respect to the arrival time of the positron at the target: the trigger for the positron tagging can be formed by a coincidence of the pulse from the MCP and the signal from the pulsed beam (see Fig. 7). This is a key point for the experiment because of the requirement to have the highest possible signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in order to suppress fake triggers. With a fake trigger we mean that the trigger is not correlated with the presence of a positron in the o-Ps formation cavity. In this case, no annihilation photons would be detected and, as a consequence, this event would be mis-identified as an invisible decay. The requirement of this coincidence suppresses:",

The o-Ps which escapes the detection region, could mimic an invisible decay because in this case the detection efficiency for the annihilation photons is reduced dramatically (Fig. 9 (a)). In their recent decay rate experiment [75], the Michigan group tried to minimize this effect to reduce the systematic error, using a double chamber-cavity, but still the escape probability for o-Ps was at 200 ppm. In our measurement such a leakage would limit the sensitivity to a Br(o \u2212 Ps \u2192 invisible) \u2243 10 \u22126 . Therefore, to be able to reach the aimed sensitivity of the experiment, one has to invent a new method. We plan to completely close the o-Ps formation cavity 3 by employing a thin (15 nm) carbon film in which the few keV positrons can pass through. However, this will block even the most energetic positronium (several eV). Furthermore, with this method an additional signature for the presence of a positron in the formation cavity is added to the trigger scheme: the coincidence between the SE from the target and the ones produced in the carbon foil ( Fig. 9 (b)). Hence, the S/N ratio will be further enhanced without a dramatic loss of the trigger rate. This point is presented in Section 4.4, some preliminary measurements have been performed in order to test this idea. The carbon films that are planned to be used are currently employed at PSI 4 in the muonic-hydrogen experiment [77] for tagging the muons. Similar to our application they are used for detecting the SE emitted by the crossing muons. Some of those films were kindly given to us from the PSI group and we tested their SE emission yield in the implantation positron energy range of 1-7 keV and their permeability to o-Ps. The great advantage of this technique is that the o-Ps leakage is expected to be reduced to a negligible level.",

The positrons are first accelerated to 2 keV energy by the voltage applied between the ground pipe and the carbon foil, thus the SEs emerging from the carbon foil (CF) are transported with this energy back to the MCP. In the second acceleration stage, the positrons are accelerated by a 1-3 keV voltage applied between the CF and the target. Once they hit the target, the SEs are transported back to the carbon foil and the electrons able to cross it are then additionally accelerated so that their final energy will be 3-5 keV (see Figure 12). Figure 13 shows a MC simulation of the time distribution of the MCP signals from different SE sources; the time zero point is defined by the incoming beam positron crossing the carbon foil. The two prominent peaks are due to the SEs emitted when the positrons hit the target (at about 21 ns) and the SEs from the carbon foil (at about 29 ns) when a positron crosses the foil. The SEs from the target are accelerated with a higher voltage than those from the foil and  reach the MCP first, although they start later and have a larger flight path. The small third peak visible in the time spectrum of the MCP is produced by additional secondary electrons generated by some SEs from the target interacting in the carbon foil. Those will be accelerated by the same voltage that accelerates the positrons and, therefore, they are detected 1-1.5 ns after the second peak (the cavity length used in the simulation was 30 mm and the positron energy is 6 keV). The broadening of the first peak is due to the angular spread of the SEs emitted from the target and scattering in the carbon foil.  ",

The threshold for the acquisition was set to 10 mV and a sample of 10 5 events was recorded in a time window of 50 ns after the arrival time at the MCP of the first electron that was defined as START signal. The start signal can be produced by the SEs from the carbon foil or by the SE produced at the target. The probability to detect a SE coming from the target is suppressed by the angular spread introduced by crossing the carbon foil, when propagating in the backward direction. This introduces in the trajectories larger spirals along the magnetic field axis with respect to the SE from the CF, and thus, reduces the probability of the SE to hit the MCP active area. An example of an event recorded with the oscilloscope is shown in Fig.  15. The START signal is given by SEs produced at the target and the pulse at 20 ns is from the SEs produced at the CF. The data in Fig. 16 show the time delay spectrum with respect to the START signal for the electrons arriving at the MCP with 10 5 triggers. These results confirm qualitatively the prediction of the simulation 6 . Note, that in this distribution the time is inverted with respect to the simulations.

The START signal and the peak at \u223c 2 ns for the dashed line in Fig. 16 (the same voltage on target and CF) is produced by SEs from the carbon foil, emitted by an incoming positron, since (almost) no SE from the target reach the MCP.

It is used to estimate the background from positrons, which do not reach the target, e.g. due to backscattering from the carbon foil. This background will be discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Note, that the value \u03ba SE (see below) is not in contradiction with the requirement for the invisible decay search experiment to have a fake trigger fraction with no energy deposition in the ECAL of < 10 \u22127 .

An escaping backscattered positron could give a trigger and be transported back by the magnetic field outside the detection region, and thus, it will not deposit any energy in the calorimeter. This effect can be suppressed by decreasing the beam transport energy E 0 so that the minimum energy loss necessary to escape from the target voltage is smaller and consequently also the escaping probability is suppressed. In this section, a precise estimation of this effect will be carried out using MC calculations. The dominant process in the backscattering effect is the positron multiple-scattering. GEANT4 has a set of low energy classes that can be included in the Physics list using PENELOPE MC cross sections such as G4PenelopeBrehmsstrahlung, G4PenelopeComptonEffect. Unfortunately, the multiple-scattering process is not yet implemented and consequently it is not possible to estimate the backscattering coefficients with GEANT4. Accurate knowledge of the energy and angular distributions of keV charged particles is possible with the EGSnrc (Electron Gamma Shower) Monte Carlo code [72]. This code includes sophisticated low-energy physics comparable with PENELOPE. Moreover, EGSnrc is considerably faster than PENELPOPE and does not require careful tuning of the simulation parameters. In EGSnrc a special package was developed for the calculation of backscattering coefficients. The performance of EGSnrc for keV backscattering particles is presented in [72] where MC simulation data are compared to experimental results for both electron and positron backscattering (see Fig. 23).",

The idea is to exploit the difference in the propagation time between the  backscattered positrons (< 10 eV) and the SE used for the trigger (>2 keV). When a SE triggers the MCP an electrode with a repulsive voltage can be activated to block and redirect back a positron that may have backscattered as shown in Fig. 29. The optimal position of the repulsion electrode has been determined assuming that the backscattered positrons have an energy between 0.1 and 10 eV. We defined the minimum distance between the electrode and the target considering the propagation time of the SE from the target to the MCP (70 ns with d=1 m, E= 2 keV) and the propagation time of the backscattered positron. The maximum electrode-target separation is given by the constraint that the detection probability for a Ps atom that is eventually formed when the positron is re-implanted in the target should still be high enough to guarantee the aimed sensitivity of the experiment. In fact, the propagation time of the positron from the target to the repulsion electrode and back shorten the acquisition time window for such an event. Taking into account the backscattering probability and the Ps lifetime, we estimated that one needs an acquisition time of at least 0.5 \u00b5s. With these requirements the electrode should be positioned in the region indicated in Fig. 29 with a thick line (green). In this way, the background produced by backscattered positrons from both the carbon foil or the target can be suppressed to values below < 10 \u22127 . Table 2, summarizes the expected background level for the different background sources.",

In the Introduction, the mirror matter relevance to the dark matter problem and its link with positronium has been reviewed. The effect of external fields (electric and magnetic) on the oscillation probability and of the collisions of o-Ps with the cavity walls were estimated. In Section 4, the design and the experimental results for the different parts of the experiment have been presented. Section 5 includes the simulation results of the background estimation and Section 6 the estimated sensitivity. The goal is to reach a sensitivity in the branching ratio of Br(o \u2212 Ps \u2192 invisible) \u2243 10 \u22127 to confront the annual modulation signal observed by DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA (with 8.2\u03c3 significance) with mirror dark matter scenarios. In case of a signal observation, the experiment would offer a unique and essential feature, whereby an increase or decrease of the signal rate by a factor \u223c 2 is possible while keeping the background constant. In case of a null result, this search will provide a limit on the photon-mirror photon mixing strength about one order of magnitude better than presently derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.",

The dashed line represents the data obtained by applying the same voltage on the carbon foil and on the sample (-1.2kV). The solid line is obtained by applying -1.2 kV on the carbon foil and -3.8kV on the sample. In this case the broadening of the peak at around 15 ns is mainly due to variations of the flight time of the SE from the target that produce the START signal. The peak at about 2 ns are due to the MCP deadtime (see text for details).",
