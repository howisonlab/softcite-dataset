In the considered model, these particles decay into their standard-model counterparts and the lightest neutralino, resulting in a signature of two jets plus missing energy. The analysis is based on full GEANT4 simulations of the CLIC_ILD detector concept, including Standard Model physics backgrounds and beam-induced hadronic backgrounds from two-photon processes. The analysis serves as a generic benchmark for the reconstruction of highly energetic jets in events with substantial missing energy. Several jet finding algorithms were evaluated, with the longitudinally invariant k t algorithm showing a high degree of robustness towards beam-induced background while preserving the features typically found in algorithms developed for e + e \u2212 collisions. The presented study of the reconstruction of light-flavored squarks shows that for TeV-scale squark masses, sub-percent accuracy on the mass measurement can be achieved at CLIC.",

These new particles are expected to have masses in the range from about 100 GeV to a few TeV, and may thus come within reach of modern colliders. In the first run of the LHC, no evidence for supersymmetric particles was observed, putting substantial constraints on",

In analyses based on simplified models [5,6], mass-degenerate firstand second-generation squarks decaying directly into one quark and the lightest neutralino are excluded up to masses of 850 GeV by ATLAS [3] and up to masses of 875 GeV by CMS [7].

It is designed to provide collision energies up to 3 TeV with high luminosity. The project is foreseen to be implemented in several stages [10] to provide optimal luminosity conditions over the whole range of energies, with the final stage reaching the full design energy of the collider. At 3 TeV, the experimental conditions are characterized by a luminosity spectrum with a sharp peak at the nominal collision energy and a long tail towards lower energies due to beamstrahlung and initial state radiation, with 35 % of the total luminosity in the top 1 % of the collision energy. Still, most of the available luminosity is concentrated at high energy, so that for processes with a threshold below the maximum energy of the collider the main consequence of the luminosity spectrum is a smearing of the production energy, reducing the effectiveness of energy constraints in the data analysis and resulting in distortions of final state particle energy distributions.",

This is motivated by the fact that the general performance requirements for ILC and CLIC are quite similar. For the CLIC detectors, design modifications motivated by the higher collision energy of up to 3 TeV and by the more challenging experimental conditions such as the very high bunch crossing rate of 2 GHz and a higher background rate than at ILC are implemented. Both detector concepts provide highly efficient tracking with excellent momentum resolution in a solenoidal field and precise secondary vertex reconstruction. Highly segmented calorimeters optimised for jet reconstruction using particle flow algorithms are foreseen. To provide the depth of the calorimeters necessary for multi-TeV operation, the barrel hadronic calorimeter uses tungsten absorbers. The inner radius of the vertex detectors is increased compared to the ILC to account for the larger beam crossing angle and the higher rate of incoherent e + e \u2212 pairs produced in the collision.

They all are characterized by a low multiplicity of highly energetic jets. The cross section of the background processes, compared with the signal, are summarized in Table 2. Beyond the dominating Standard Model (SM) processes there are also potential SUSY backgrounds, which have not been considered here. They would have comparable cross sections to the signal, but more complex final states, likely resulting in a substantial rejection by the event selection. Backgrounds of the type \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 qq(+X ) and e \u00b1 \u03b3 \u2192 qq(+X ) were likewise ignored, since they lead to highly boosted final states and typically do not result in events with very large missing transverse energy (E miss T ), and are thus expected to be fully rejected by the event selection. Such processes are only considered in the context of beam-induced background as  \"pile-up\" on physics events, as discussed below. After the event selection discussed in Sect. 6.1, only processes with substantial missing transverse energy remain significant. Events, both signal and background, were generated with WHIZARD 1.95 [15], using PYTHIA [16] for the hadronization. The three dominating background processes, listed under \"SM, E miss \" in Table 2 have cross sections of two to more than three orders of magnitude higher than the signal, resulting in a combined cross section of approximately 8 pb. For an integrated luminosity of 2 ab \u22121 , this would result in 16 million events, which is beyond what could be fully simulated for this study. Thus, the number of events that was simulated was reduced by a generator-level cut on the missing transverse energy. Two different thresholds are used, one at E miss T of 530 GeV, above which all events are passed to the full simulation, and one at 330 GeV, above which 10 % of all events which are below the higher threshold are fully simulated. With these cuts, the number of events to be simulated was reduced to approximately 250 000. To help the signal and background discrimination, a cut on missing transverse energy requiring more than 600 GeV E miss T was applied in the analysis, which means that only events above the higher threshold, which are simulated for the full integrated luminosity, contribute significantly to the final event sample. The background events with intermediate E miss T are used to confirm this expectation, and are not considered in the final analysis. The transverse missing energy rather than the full missing energy is used in this first level of event selection to make it robust against the smearing of collision energies and the resulting boost of the final state system introduced by the luminosity spectrum of the collider.",

The time stamp of each reconstructed particle is required to match closely with the time of the interesting physics event, where the most powerful timing information is obtained from the calorimeters. The timing cut varies with the transverse momentum ( p T ) of the particle, since low p T particles are more likely to be background. The cuts reject particles with reconstructed times inconsistent with the reconstructed event time. Particles with p T > 4 GeV (8 GeV in the case of neutral hadrons) are accepted irrespective of timing. For particles below that threshold, particle type and regiondependent cuts between 1 and 3 ns are applied, with the most severe cuts in the forward region below a p T of 0.75 GeV. More details are given in [9,19]. In addition to these cuts, jet finding plays a major role in the rejection of beam related background. Its influence, as well as the impact of the background rejection cuts, are discussed in the following.",

The sensitivity of the different algorithms to \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background is illustrated on events without timing cuts. In those events, the added 60 bunch crossings of background contribute an excess energy of 1.4 TeV in the main calorimeters. The performance in a realistic environment is studied using timing cuts in the event reconstruction as discussed in Sect. 3. In addition, a baseline comparison is provided with events without the overlay of background. Figure 1 shows the sum of energy of the two most energetic jets found in the event for squark signal events for different jet finders, compared to the reference distribution of the true signal-only energy, given by the full visible energy E vis from the signal MC event record for different background scenarios. Figure 1a shows the situation without the overlay of \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons events, Fig. 1b the case for a full 60 bunch crossings of background without any timing cuts, and Fig. 1c the realistic case with the application of timing and transverse momentum cuts on the reconstructed particle flow objects. While the classic Durham algorithm provides the best agreement with the reference distribution in the case of no background, it picks up almost the complete 1.4 TeV of additional energy when the full background is included, and also severely suffers from background pickup when timing cuts are used. This makes the algorithm unsuitable for jet finding at CLIC at energies where the contributions from \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons processes are sizeable, which is the case for energies of 500 GeV and above. The other, hadroncollider-inspired, algorithms all show a comparable performance when reconstructing the visible energy. For analyses that target specific final-state signatures such as the present squark analysis, the possibility of forcing the events to be clustered into a pre-defined number of jets provided by exclusive algorithms is very convenient, leading to the choice of the longitudinally invariant k t algorithm for the physics benchmark analyses at CLIC [9]. While this procedure favors the inclusion of additional particles into the signal jets which otherwise are reconstructed as additional jets, it is found that this still results in a better definition of the kinematic observable used in the squark analysis, discussed in detail below, than the use of inclusive algorithms with variable number of jets. Recently, a new algorithm, the Valenica algorithm, has been introduced, based on the experience with jet finding in the CLIC and ILC physics studies [27]. This algorithm combines features of the longitudinally invariant k t algorithm and the classic k t algorithm. Since this algorithm was proposed after the completion of the physics studies for the CLIC CDR it is not considered in the present analysis.",

In practice, the shape of the edge is slightly smeared out by detector resolution effects, which need to be accounted for in this analysis. The construction of M C assumes that the center-of-mass system of the collision is at rest in the detector system, which evidently is not the case at CLIC due to beamstrahlung and initial state radiation. Still, the boost of the collision system with respect to the laboratory frame is typically quite small for the high center-of-mass energies required to produce TeVscale objects, making it advantageous to use the complete available information, and not just transverse observables, as would be done at hadron colliders. The beam energy spectrum leads to a slight distortion of the edge of the M C distribution, which can be precisely modelled based on the knowledge of the luminosity spectrum. The best precision on the squark mass can thus be obtained from template fits which take the effect of the beam energy spectrum of CLIC into account, allows the inclusion of effects of selection cuts on the M C distribution and maximizes the use of the available statistics by considering all reconstructed events.",

The mass extraction technique with generator-level templates is tested for possible biases introduced by potential systematic differences between the templates without the multivariate event selection and the fully simulated distribution. For this test, the mass measurement is applied to a high-statistics signal-only sample. No statistically significant deviation from the input mass value is observed, excluding mass biases larger than 1.2 GeV. In addition, the BDT, which is trained for a specific squark mass, can result in systematic shifts due to the choice of this training value. To investigate this bias, the BDT training was repeated with fully simulated data samples with positive and negative mass offsets of 10 and 20 GeV. This study has shown an 80 MeV shift of the reconstructed mass per GeV offset in the BDT training sample. The bias originating from the event selection procedure can thus be reduced to a level substantially below the statistical uncertainty in an iterative procedure. Also the subtraction of non-squark background prior to the template fit is a potential source for systematic uncertainties. To investigate the sensitivity of the mass measurement to this subtraction, the normalization of the background parametrization is varied in the template fit. A \u00b110 % variation of the normalization, corresponding to a 10 % uncertainty in the background efficiency, results in a shift of \u22130.5 GeV in the reconstructed mass. Since the standard-model background does not exhibit the same sharp upper edge as the signal, the mass measurement is not very sensitive to uncertainties in the background subtraction.",

Here, a simplified, conservative approach has been used by investigating two modified spectra where 5 % of the events have either been moved from the peak of the spectrum to the tail and vice versa [9]. Mass mea-surements of gauginos based on template fits of the energy distribution of the hadronically decaying final-state Standard Model bosons showed biases of approximately 1 % with such modifications [9]. In slepton measurements based on the edges of the lepton energy distributions, shifts of up to 0.2 % in the measured mass were observed [9]. With a more realistic study of the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the luminosity spectrum, this uncertainty was reduced by approximately one order of magnitude [31]. In contrast, the shift observed in the present analysis is only 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 even with the conservative uncertainty estimate, and thus completely negligible. This is due to the construction of the observable used for the mass measurement, M C , which is independent of the true collision energy, and thus very insensitive to variations in the luminosity spectrum.",

Using a combination of missing energy and multivariate classifiers it was possible to achieve a high signal significance despite standardmodel background processes that exceed the signal production cross section by almost four orders of magnitude. The beam-induced background from \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons processes is controlled by timing cuts in the reconstruction and by the use of the longitudinally invariant k t algorithm for jet finding. For right-handed squarks with a mass of around 1125 GeV and a combined production cross section of 1.5 fb, a statistical precision of 6.5 GeV, corresponding to 0.58 %, was achieved for the mass measurement for combined up-and down-type squarks with an integrated luminosity of 2 ab \u22121 at 3 TeV using a template fit with generator-level templates. Systematic changes in the luminosity spectrum have a negligible effect on the measurement, demonstrating the robustness of the technique used for the mass measurement. Other systematics are expected to be comparable to or smaller than the statistical uncertainties. These results demonstrate the capability of CLIC for precision measurements of generic new TeV-scale states decaying into a hadronic jet and an invisible particle.",

The lower M C region is affected by the E miss T cut, but not further modified by the application of the BDT. This shows that the event selection itself does not introduce a sizeable bias in the mass measurement. Potential systematics arising from the event selection procedure are discussed in more detail in Sect. 6.3.Cross-checks of the multivariate classifier distributions for signal and background performed by comparing the distributions for the training sample with those for the testing sample show that the classification works successfully. For the chosen cut value of B DT > \u22120.066, a signal significance of S/ \u221a S + B = 25.9 is observed for the training sample, while S/ \u221a S + B = 25.7 is achieved for the testing sample.
