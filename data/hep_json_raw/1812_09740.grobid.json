VBS diagrams are not independently gauge invariant and cannot be studied separately from other processes leading to the same V V jj final state [5]. Two categories of processes give rise to V V jj final states. The first category, which includes VBS contributions, involves exclusively weak interactions at Born level of order \u03b1 6 EW including the boson decays, where \u03b1 EW is the electroweak coupling constant. It is referred to as electroweak production. The second category involves both the strong and electroweak interactions at Born level of order \u03b1 2 S \u03b1 4 EW , where \u03b1 S is the strong interaction coupling constant. It is referred to as QCD production. According to the SM a small interference occurs between electroweak and QCD production.",

This W Z jj\u2212QCD sample includes matrixelement b-quarks. Both Sherpa samples were generated using the NNPDF3.0 [36] PDF set. Interferences between the two processes were estimated at LO using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3 [37] MC event generator with the NNPDF3.0 PDF set, including only contributions to the squared matrix-element of order one in \u03b1 S . They are found to be positive and approximately 10% of the W Z jj\u2212EW cross-section in the fiducial phase space and are treated as an uncertainty in the measurement, as discussed in Section 8. For the estimation of modelling uncertainties, alternative MC samples of W Z jj\u2212QCD and W Z jj\u2212EW processes were generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3 at LO in QCD, including up to two partons in the matrix-element for W Z jj\u2212QCD, and using the NNPDF3.0 PDF set. MC samples of inclusive W \u00b1 Z production generated at NLO in QCD with the Powheg-Box v2 [38][39][40][41] generator, interfaced to Pythia 8.210 or Herwig++ 2.7.1 [42] for simulation of parton showering and hadronisation are also used for tests of the modelling of W Z jj\u2212QCD events.",

The transverse momentum threshold of the leptons in 2015 was 24 GeV for electrons and 20 GeV for muons satisfying a loose isolation requirement based only on ID track information. Due to the higher instantaneous luminosity in 2016 the trigger threshold was increased to 26 GeV for both the electrons and muons and tighter isolation requirements were applied. Possible inefficiencies for leptons with large transverse momenta were reduced by including additional electron and muon triggers that did not include any isolation requirements with transverse momentum thresholds of p T = 60 GeV and 50 GeV, respectively. Finally, a single-electron trigger requiring p T > 120 GeV or p T > 140 GeV in 2015 and 2016, respectively, with less restrictive electron identification criteria was used to increase the selection efficiency for high-p T electrons. The combined efficiency of these triggers is close to 100% for W \u00b1 Z jj events.

The shapes of distributions of kinematic observables of this irreducible background are modelled by the Sherpa MC simulation. The normalisation of this background is, however, constrained by data in a dedicated control region. and W W production processes. The reducible backgrounds are estimated using a data-driven method based on the inversion of a global matrix containing the efficiencies and the misidentification probabilities for prompt and fake leptons [10,53]. The method exploits the classification of the lepton as loose or tight candidates and the probability that a fake lepton is misidentified as a loose or tight lepton candidate. Tight leptons candidates are signal lepton candidates as defined in Section 5. Loose lepton candidates are leptons that do not meet the isolation and identification criteria of signal lepton candidates but satisfy only looser criteria. The misidentification probabilities for fake leptons are determined from data, using dedicated control samples enriched in non-prompt leptons from heavy-flavour jets and in misidentified leptons from photon conversions or charged hadrons in light-flavour jets. The lepton misidentification probabilities are applied to samples of W \u00b1 Z jj candidate events in data where at least one and up to three of the lepton candidates are loose. Then, using a matrix inversion, the number of events with at least one misidentified lepton, which represents the amount of reducible background in the selected W \u00b1 Z jj sample, is obtained. The number of observed events together with the expected background contributions are summarised in Table 1 for the signal region and the three control regions. All sources of uncertainties, as described in Section 8, are included. The expected signal purity in the W \u00b1 Z jj signal region is about 13%, and 72% of the events arise from W Z jj\u2212QCD production.",

The distribution of the BDT score in the W \u00b1 Z jj signal region is used to extract the significance of the W Z jj\u2212EW signal and to measure its fiducial cross-section via a maximum-likelihood fit. An extended likelihood is built from the product of four likelihoods corresponding to the BDT score distribution in the W \u00b1 Z jj SR, the m jj distribution in the W Z jj\u2212QCD CR, the multiplicity of reconstructed b-quarks in the b-CR and the m jj distribution in the Z Z -CR.

Uncertainties due to higher order QCD corrections are evaluated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales independently by factors of two and one-half, removing combinations where the variations differ by a factor of four. These uncertainties are of \u221220% to +30% on the W Z jj\u2212QCD background normalisation and up to \u00b15% on the W Z jj\u2212EW signal shape. The uncertainties due to the PDF and the \u03b1 S value used in the PDF determination are evaluated using the PDF4LHC prescription [56]. They are of the order of 1% to 2% in shape of the predicted cross-section. A global modelling uncertainty in the W Z jj\u2212QCD background template that includes effects of the parton shower model is estimated by comparing predictions of the BDT score distribution in the signal region from the Sherpa and MadGraph MC event generators. The difference between the predicted shapes of the BDT score distribution from the two generators is considered as an uncertainty. The resulting uncertainty ranges from 5% to 20% at medium and high values of the BDT score, respectively. Alternatively, using two MC samples with different parton shower models, Powheg+Pythia8 and Powheg+Herwig, it was verified that for W Z jj\u2212QCD events the variations of the BDT score shape due to different parton shower models are within the global modelling uncertainty defined above. A global modelling uncertainty in the W Z jj\u2212EW signal template is also estimated by comparing predictions of the BDT score distribution in the signal region from the Sherpa and MadGraph MC event generators. This modelling uncertainty affects the shape of the BDT score distribution by at most 14% at large values of the BDT score. The Sherpa W Z jj\u2212EW sample used in this analysis was recently found to implement a colour flow computation in VBS-like processes that increases central parton emissions from the parton shower [57]. It was verified that possible effects on kinematic distributions and especially on the BDT score distribution are covered by the modelling uncertainty used. The interference between electroweak-and QCD-induced processes is not included in the probability distribution functions of the fit but is considered as an uncertainty affecting only the shape of the W Z jj\u2212EW MC template. The effect is determined using the MadGraph MC generator, resulting for the signal region in shape-only uncertainties ranging from 10% to 5% at low and high values of the BDT score, respectively. The effect of interference on the shape of the W Z jj\u2212EW MC template in the W \u00b1 Z jj-QCD CR is negligible and is therefore not included.",
