The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration have recently completed joint data runs of unprecedented sensitivities to gravitational waves. So far, no gravitational radiation has been seen (although data mining continues). It seems likely that the first detection will come from 2nd-generation LIGO and Virgo interferometers now being installed. These new detectors are expected to detect \u223c40 coalescences of neutron star binary systems per year at full sensitivity. At the same time, research and development continues on 3rd-generation underground interferometers and on space-based interferometers. In parallel there is a vigorous effort in the radio pulsar community to detect \u223cseveral-nHz gravitational waves via the timing residuals from an array of pulsars at different locations in the sky. As the dawn of gravitational wave astronomy nears, this review, intended primarily for interested particle and nuclear physicists, describes what we have learned to date and the prospects for direct discovery of gravitational waves.",

Scientists have searched for these waves for several decades without success, but with the ongoing installation and commissioning of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors, direct discovery of gravitational waves appears to be only a few years away (or perhaps sooner if deep mining of initial LIGO and Virgo data succeeds). There is also a possibility that radio astronomers will succeed first in direct detection of gravitational waves -at extremely low frequencies (\u223c several nHz) via their influence on apparent pulsar timing. This review article is intended for an audience of nuclear and particle physicists already conversant in special relativity and electrodynamics who want to understand why gravitational waves are interesting, what technical and analytic methods are used in direct searches for this predicted radiation, and what the prospects are for discovery in this decade. Particular attention is given to the evolving data analysis techniques in this rapidly developing field.",

            "text": "The search for gravitational waves has many motivations. First is simple, fundamental scientific curiosity about new phenomena. More prosaically, one can use gravitational radiation to test general relativity. For example, one can test the predicted transverse and quadrupolar nature of the radiation, and one can test whether or not the radiation travels at the speed of light, as one would expect for a massless graviton. One can also directly probe highly relativistic phenomena, such as blackhole formation. Perhaps more intriguing, though, is the entirely new view one gains of the universe. Gravitational waves cannot be appreciably absorbed by dust or stellar envelopes, and most detectable sources are some of the most interesting and least understood objects in the universe. More generally, gravitational wave astronomy opens up an entirely new non-electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomy has found many surprises since the mid 20th-century, as non-optical light bands have been explored, from the radio to gamma rays. New surprises likely await in the exploration of the gravitational spectrum. We do not yet know the sky distribution of detectable sources, but it is likely to include both isotropic components from sources at cosmological distances and local components dominated by our own galactic plane.",

The famous Hulse-Taylor binary system, consisting of an observed pulsar with 17-Hz radio emission in an 8-hour orbit with an unseen neutron star companion, has shown a small but unmistakable quadratic decrease in orbital period (\u223c40 seconds over 30 years), in remarkably good agreement with expectation from gravitational wave energy loss [2]. The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Taylor and Hulse for the discovery and use of the PSR B1913+16 system to test general relativity, in particular, for the verification of an orbital decay rate consistent with that expected from gravitational wave energy emission. Its presumed gravitational wave emission frequency (\u223c70 \u00b5Hz) is far too low to be observed directly by present gravitational wave detectors, but if we were to wait about 300 million years, the system would eventually spiral into a spectacular coalescence easily \"heard\" with present gravitational wave detectors.",

            "text": "Perhaps our best hope for gravitational wave discovery lies with corresponding binary systems in the numerous galaxies far away from us, but there are large uncertainties in estimated coalescence rates for compact binary systems containing neutron stars (NS) and/or black holes (BH). For example, a recent compilation of rates [3] estimates a \"plausible\" range from 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to 0.2 per year for initial LIGO detection of a NS-NS coalescence, 7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 0.1 per year for a NS-BH coalescence, and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to 0.5 per year for BH-BH coalescence, assuming 1.4-M NS and \u223c10-M BH (M \u2261 solar mass = 2.0 \u00d7 10 30 kg). As discussed below, these predicted rates increase dramatically for 2nd-generation detectors. For example, a realistic estimate for Advanced LIGO at full sensitivity is 40 detected NS-NS coalescences per year. Estimates for NS-BH and BH-BH inspiral rates have especially large uncertainties [3], but such systems could be observed at farther distances because their larger masses give rise to large gravitational wave amplitudes in the final stages of the inspiral. Similarly, the waveform shapes for inspiraling binary systems are thought to be well understood for systems with two neutron star systems, while larger uncertainties apply to systems with one or two black holes. Nonetheless, there has been recent dramatic progress in numerical-relativity calculations of expected waveforms in these complicated systems.",

With the expected order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity of the advanced detectors, a galactic supernova with 100 times smaller energy or a supernova with the same energy ten times further away would be accessible. Note, however, that until one reaches the Andromeda galaxy (\u223c780 kpc), there is relatively little additional stellar mass beyond the edge of the Milky Way, with nearby dwarf galaxies contributing only a few percent additional mass. (Nonetheless, the most recent known nearby supernova -SN1987A -was in the Large Magellanic Cloud at \u223c50 kpc.)

Although \"ordinary\" neutron stars are characterized by extremely strong surface magnetic fields (\u223c10 12 G), many magnetars appear to have fields \u223c100-1000 times still stronger, implying enormous pent-up magnetic energy. It is thought that soft gamma ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are different observational manifestations of the same underlying system -a highly magnetized star which sporadically converts magnetic field energy into radiation [41]. Whether this process involves rupture of the neutron star crust, vortex rearrangement in a core superconducting fluid, or some other process, is not yet well understood. Especially dramatic instances are superflares, such as the December 2004 flare from SGR 1806-20, in which \u223c10 39 J (10 46 erg) of electromagnetic energy was released [42]. This radiation release from \u223c10 kpc away disturbed the Earth's ionosphere sufficiently to disrupt some radio communications [43]. How much gravitational wave energy might be released in such events is unclear, although it has been proposed that the energy released into neutron star crustal vibrations could be comparable to that released electromagnetically [44], in which case gravitational radiation due to those vibrations could be substantial. For scale, the magnetic energy stored in a neutron star with surface field of 10 15 G is O(10 40 J = 10 47 erg), assuming an internal field no larger than the surface field. If the star had still stronger internal fields, the energy would be still larger. Given the uncertainties in the mechanism leading to these enormous radiation releases, it is hard to be confident of predicted waveforms. Hence generic GW transient algorithms are appropriate in searching for flares, as discussed below in section 4.3.",

In either model, kinks in these strings would travel at the speed of light with an isotropic distribution of directions, generating a model-dependent gravitational wave spectrum that is collimated along the direction of cusp travel. According to this idea, one would expect a cosmological background of GW bursts, that might be detected individually.

These r-modes can be inherently unstable, arising from azimuthal interior currents that are retrograde in the star's rotating frame, but are prograde in an external reference frame. As a result, the quadrupolar gravitational wave emission due to these currents leads to an increase in the strength of the current. This positive-feedback loop leads to an intrinsic instability. The frequency of such emission is expected to be approximately 4/3 the rotation frequency [48]. Serious concerns have been raised [49], however, about the detection utility of this effect for young isolated neutron stars (other than truly newborn stars in our galaxy), where mode saturation appears to occur at low r-mode amplitudes because of various dissipative effects. This notion of a runaway rotational instability was first appreciated for high-frequency f -modes [50], (Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability), but realistic viscosity effects seem likely to suppress the effect [51].",

One class of such systems is the set of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in which the neutron star (\u223c1.4 M ) has a much lighter companion (\u223c0.3 M ) [54] that overfills its Roche lobe, spilling material onto an accretion disk surrounding the neutron star or possibly spilling material directly onto the star, near its magnetic polar caps. When the donor companion star eventually shrinks and decouples from the neutron star, the neutron star can retain a large fraction of its maximum angular momentum and rotational energy. Because the neutron star's magnetic field decreases during accretion (through processes that are not well understood), the spin-down rate after decoupling can be very small.",

A recent calculation suggests that this surprising result can be explained by reverse-torque spindown during the Roche lobe decoupling phase [59]. In fact, measured braking indices for even young pulsars tend to be less than three, suggesting that the model of a neutron star spinning down with constant magnetic field is inaccurate [54]. (See refs. [60] for discussions of spindown evolution in the presence of both gravitational wave and electromagnetic torques.) In summary, there are at least three distinct populations of neutron stars potentially detectable via continuous gravitational waves: relatively young, isolated stars with spin frequencies below \u223c50 Hz, such as the Crab pulsar; actively accreting stars in binary systems; and recycled \"millisecond\" stars for which accretion has ceased and which generally have rotation frequencies above 100 Hz. In some cases the companion donor has disappeared, e.g., via ablation, leaving an isolated neutron star, but most known millisecond pulsars remain in binary systems, as is clear from figure 3, based on data from the Australia National Telescope Facility's pulsar database [58] Let's now consider the gravitational radiation one might expect from these stars.

From the above equation, one finds an age-based strain limit of 1.2\u00d710 \u221224 , which is accessible to initial LIGO and Virgo detectors in their most sensitive band.

A later detailed numerical simulation [63] revealed, however, that the steady-state assumption does not generally hold, leading to ellipticity-dependent expected maximum amplitudes that can be 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in the LIGO band for ellipticities as low as 10 \u22129 and a few times lower for ellipticity of about 10 \u22126 .",

It has been suggested [68] that there is a \"speed limit\" governed by gravitational wave emission that governs the maximum rotation rate of an accreting star. In principle, the distribution of frequencies could have a quite sharp upper frequency cutoff, since the angular momentum emission is proportional to the 5th power of the frequency. For example, for an equilibrium frequency corresponding to a particular accretion rate, doubling the accretion rate would increase the equilibrium frequency by only about 15%.",

One must remember, however, that matter can and will diffuse into the crust under the star's enormous gravitational field. This diffusion of charged matter can be slowed by the also-enormous magnetic fields in the crust, but detailed calculations [69] indicate the slowing is not dramatic. Another proposed mechanism is excitation of r-modes in the fluid interior of the star [48], with both steady-state emission and cyclic spinup-spindown possible [70,49].",

From figure 4, it is clear, though, that even advanced detectors fall far short of the sensitivity needed to probe standard inflation.  [80]. Results for LIGO S4 and S5 searches are shown in the frequency band around 100 Hz, along with projected Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The indirect bounds due to BBN and CMBR / matter power spectra apply to the integral of \u2126 GW (f ) over the frequency bands denoted by the corresponding dashed curves. Projected sensitivities of the satellite-based Planck CMBR experiment and LISA GW detector are also shown. The pulsar bound is based on the fluctuations in the pulse arrival times of millisecond pulsars and applies at frequencies around 10 \u22128 Hz. Measurements of the CMBR at large angular scales constrain the possible redshift of CMBR photons due to a stochastic gravitational wave background, and therefore limit the amplitude of that background at largest wavelengths (smallest frequencies). Examples of inflationary, cosmic strings, and pre-big-bang models are also shown (the amplitude and the spectral shape in these models can vary significantly as a function of model parameters).",

In the space-based detector band (\u223c 10 \u22124 -1 Hz for the original LISA design [83]), the coalescences could be from supermassive black hole mergers, e.g., from galaxy collisions.

In the late 1990s, before 1st-generation gravitational wave interferometers came online, there were five major bar detectors operating cooperatively in the International Gravitational Event Collaboration (IGEC) [88]: Allegro [89] at Louisiana State University; Auriga [90] at Padua University, Explorer [91] at CERN, Nautilus [91] at Frascati Laboratory, and Niobe [92] at the University of Western Australia. These bars achieved impressive strain amplitude spectral noise densities near 10 \u221221 / \u221a Hz, but only in narrow bands of \u223c1-30 Hz [93] near their resonant frequencies (ranging from \u223c700 Hz to \u223c900 Hz). Hence waveform reconstruction for all but very narrowband gravitational wave sources was not feasible with these detectors. As of 2012, only the Auriga and Nautilus detectors are still collecting data, since the major interferometer detectors LIGO and Virgo have achieved broadband sensitivities better than the narrowband sensitivities of the bars. It should be noted, however, that as of 2012, the LIGO and Virgo detectors are undergoing major upgrades (discussed in section 3.4), leaving GEO 600 as the only major gravitational wave interferometer collecting data routinely for the next several years. Should a supernova occur in our galaxy during that time, only GEO 600 and the remaining bar detectors would have a chance of detecting it in gravitational waves.",

Setting aside enhancements to be discussed below, a simple right-angle Michelson laser interferometer, as shown in the cartoon in figure 6 [94] is a natural gravitational-wave detector. For example, a linearly polarized wave impinging normally on the interferometer with its polarization axis aligned with the arms will alternately stretch one arm while contracting the other. One common question is how this alternation is detected, given that the laser light is stretched and compressed too. The answer is that the detection is based on the phase difference between the light returning from each arm, and that phase difference increases with time, following the passage of the gravitational wave. The red-shifted light simply takes longer to complete its round-trip in the arm than the blue-shifted light. Hence even an idealized, simple gravitational-wave interferometer has a finite and frequency-dependent response time. An intuitive elaboration on this concept and a related gedanken experiment can be found in ref. [95].",

It was early work carried out in parallel by Rai Weiss [99], however, that laid the groundwork for present-day gravitational wave interferometers. As discussed further below, it became appreciated quickly that laser interferometers had the potential to surpass bar detectors in sensitivity, and there was rapid development of ideas and technology. Subsequent improvements included (among many others) using Fabry-Perot cavities for the interferometer arms to increase the time of exposure of the laser light to the gravitational wave [100], introduction of a \"recycling\" mirror between the laser and beam-splitter, to increase effective laser power [101], and introduction of another mirror between the beam splitter and photodetector to allow tuning of the interferometer's frequency response [102].",

As discussed in more detail below, the LIGO and Virgo interferometers have achieved significant improvement over this sensitivity by using Fabry-Perot cavities in the arms and a recycling mirror to increase effective light power. Other improvements, such as elaborate laser intensity and frequency stabilization, along with a heterodyne RF readout scheme that allows the interferometer to operate with near-destructive interference at the photodiode, mitigate non-fundamental noise sources that would otherwise invalidate the above simple model. As with bars, there is a nominal quantum limit. Naively, one could improve sensitivity arbitrarily by increasing laser power, to reduce shot noise (\u221d 1/ N phot ), but at some intensity, radiation pressure fluctuations (\u221d N phot ) become limiting. Note that the effects of radiation pressure are reduced by increasing the masses of the mirrors. For example, Advanced LIGO mirrors will be 40 kg, much heavier than the 11-kg mirrors used for Initial LIGO, in order to cope with the increased laser power (\u223c180 W vs \u223c10 W). One could imagine increasing mirror mass with laser power indefinitely, but sustaining Figure 7: Antenna response pattern for a Michelson interferometer in the long-wavelength approximation.

A useful way to think about the quantum fluctuations is that when the interferometer is operated near a point of destructive interference, vacuum fluctuations in the quantum field \"leak\" back into the interferometer. In some sense, squeezing the interferometer is actually squeezing the vacuum state with which it interacts. Squeezing has been demonstrated not only in tabletop experiments [110], but also on two large-scale gravitational wave interferometers (GEO 600 [111] and LIGO [112]).

Saulson [6] provides a nice summary of these experiments and searches. Prototype interferometers were built and operated around the world in Australia, Europe, Japan and the United States. These prototypes led eventually to the building of six major interferometers: TAMA (300-m arms) near Tokyo [113], GEO 600 (600-m arms) near Hannover [114], Virgo (3000-m arms) near Pisa [115], and LIGO (two with 4000-m arms and one with 2000-m arms ) in the states of Washington and Louisiana [116,117,118,94,139]. Figure 8 shows aerial views of the two LIGO sites in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. The major interferometers share many design characteristics, but also display significant differences. In the following, the design of the 4-km LIGO interferometers will be described in some detail, followed by only a brief summary of differences between LIGO and the other major detectors. As a result, the bibliography is LIGO-centric and makes no attempt to document all of the critical technical developments leading to the other major interferometers.

The above analysis idealized the laser light as a plane wave and used planar mirrors. But high-quality lasers produce Gaussian beams with curved wavefronts. Fabry-Perot cavities are normally designed with at least one curved mirror (usually concave as seen from the cavity), such that a Gaussian beam resonates with a spherical wavefront at the mirror(s) with radii of wavefront curvature at those locations to match those of the mirror(s). For a cavity of length L with two concave mirrors of radii R 1 and R 2 , it is useful [119] to define mirror g factors g i \u2261 1 \u2212 L/R i , from which one can derive the beam's characteristic intensity radii at the mirrors (w 1 and w 2 ) and the beam's \"waist\" (minimum radius):",

Ensuring that the mirror aperture is much larger than the maximum beam radius is an important design constraint. It should be noted that an infinite number of Gaussian-modulated waveforms can resonate in a cavity (e.g., with Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian envelopes), but their resonant lengths differ slightly because of differing Gouy phases [119]. As a result, a servo-locked cavity resonating in the fundamental mode (normally desired) will not generally simultaneously resonate in higher order modes that could introduce confusion into the servo error signal.

An exercise for the reader is verification that explicit summation of the intensity contributions from equation 71at \u2126 mod t and 2 \u2126 mod t cancel to zero. The key to the PDH scheme [121] is that the carrier and sidebands have different resonant characteristics in a Fabry-Perot cavity. For example, the carrier might resonate, while the fundamental sidebands reflect promptly with negligible leakage into the cavity. In that case (for \u2126 mod 2\u03c0f FSR , where f FSR = c / 2L is the free spectral range of the cavity) the beat between the reflected carrier and sideband will cancel for carrier resonance, but will have a non-zero residual beat when the carrier is off resonance. For small deviations from resonance, the strength at the beat frequency is proportional to the deviation in cavity length from its resonance value. Hence an error signal for locking the cavity frequency to the laser frequency can be derived. One can just as well, treat the error signal as a measure of the laser frequency's deviation from what resonates in the cavity, and feed back to the laser frequency to lock the servo, e.g., by actuating on a piezoelectric controller on one mirror of the Fabry-Perot lasing cavity.",

The suspension came from a single loop of steel wire around each mirror's waist. Mirrors were controlled by electromagnetic actuators -magnets bonded to the optics and influenced by currents in nearby coils mounted on the support structure. For further isolation from ground motion, the pendulum support structures were mounted on four stages of mass-spring isolation stacks [124].  In addition to locking the arms on resonance, in order to obtain exquisite sensitivity to distance changes between the arm mirrors, one must also \"lock\" the relative position of the beam splitter with respect to the arm input mirrors so as to establish a well defined interference condition at the output photodetector. Although one might naively choose the interference to be halfway between fully destructive and fully constructive, in order to maximize the derivative of intensity with respect to relative phase of the light returning from the arms, it pays instead to choose an interference operating point that is at or near fully destructive (a null condition) [6].",

In principle, the disturbance from a gravitational wave produces a non-zero light intensity where there was previously only dark current. One might worry that the increase in intensity would lead to a phase ambiguity, but the PDH signals used to control the interferometer arms provided a neat solution. By introducing a deliberate (Schnupp) asymmetry [125] (355 mm for LIGO) in the distance between the beam splitter and the arm input mirrors, one obtains non-cancelling PDH sidebands at the photodetector that stand ready to beat with any non-cancelling carrier light induced by a passing gravitational wave, where the phase of the beat signal reveals the phase of the gravitational wave.",

Now we add one more primary mirror to control, namely the recycling mirror located between the laser and the beam splitter. By ensuring that the average optical path length between the recycling mirror and the arm input mirrors is a half integer of laser wavelengths, one achieves resonance of the light in what is called the recycling cavity [101,126]. Hence the light returning toward the laser that would have otherwise been discarded by the Faraday isolation optics (to prevent interference with the laser itself), is recycled back into the main interferometer. This recycling effectively increases the laser power in the entire interferometer and thereby decreases shot noise due to limited photon statistics. The addition of this mirror increases the number of primary longitudinal servo-controlled degrees of freedom to four.",

A technique [127] based on allowing the servo to \"coast\" through that delicate transition period provides a robust solution, albeit one that still relies upon stochastic swinging of mirrors to bring the degrees of freedom under simultaneous control.",

Wobbling of the mirrors modulates interferometer gain, leading to non-linear noise. Hence each angular degree of freedom is also servocontrolled. There are two distinct stages of angular control. The first, which works well for initial control authority, is based on shining an auxiliary laser on each mirror at a non-normal angle and observing the transverse displacement of the reflected beam. This \"optical lever\" method is straightforward and does not require the longitudinal degrees of freedom to be locked, but it comes with the risk of introducing extra noise due to the auxiliary laser and due to any ground motion of the external photodiode. The second angular control method is known as \"wave front sensing\" and uses the PDH sidebands to sense the misalignment of optical cavity degrees of freedom [128]. This second method can only be used when the longitudinal degrees of freedom are locked, at which point it \"takes over\" from the optical lever (at least at lower frequencies) after fully recycled lock is achieved. Because the method is based on spatial asymmetries in carrier-sideband phase differences caused by cavity misalignment, one can obtain a DC alignment signal without relying on the external reference points that introduce additional positional noise.",

The intrinsic frequency stability of the laser is increased by locking the laser to the interferometer arms. It should be noted that tidal effects from the Moon and Sun lead to compression and stretching of LIGO's arms at the level of hundreds of microns, well outside the dynamic range of the low-noise direct actuation on the mirrors (based on sending currents through voice coils surrounding cylindrical magnets bonded to the faces of the mirrors near their edges). To cope with this predictable and very slowly changing disturbance, a feed-forward actuation is applied via piezoelectric transducers to the positions of the vacuum chambers supporting the mirrors and to the frequency of the laser via a temperature controlled reference cavity with respect to which the laser frequency is offset (\u223c10 pm), via an acousto-optic modulator.",

At low frequencies (<\u223c45 Hz), the noise is dominated by seismic ground motion, despite the strong isolation provided by the multiple stages of passive oscillators. At high frequencies (>\u223c100 Hz), sensing shot noise dominates. At intermediate frequencies important known contributions come from noise coupled to two auxiliary servoed degrees of freedom, which can be thought of as the positions of the beam splitter and recycling mirrors; from thermal noise in the suspension wires; from noise coupled to mirror alignment fluctuations (due to residual beam non-centering); and from current noise in the actuation electronics, which must support demanding dynamic range requirements [94]. Less important noise contributions come from thermal noise in the mirrors; from dark-current noise in the photodiodes; from laser frequency noise; from laser amplitude noise; and from phase noise in the RF oscillator used for PDH locking and for the heterodyne readout. Some of the noise curves shown in the budget are based on models, while others can be determined from measured transfer functions.",

Upconversion can arise, for example, from mirror wobble, modulated beam apertures, and modulated beam backscattering [129]. Scattering from surfaces attached rigidly to the ground is strongly suppressed by elaborate serrated-edge baffling along the length of beam pipe and in other strategic locations, but even tiny scattering contributions can be deleterious when the surface is moving relative to the mirrors [129].",

            "text": "Commissioning of the LIGO interferometers required several years, as the sensitivities of the instruments approached their designs. The official design requirement [133] was to reach a band-limited RMS strain in a 100-Hz band as low as 10 \u221221 . In addition, a more optimistic aspirational target curve was produced. Figure 11  [94] shows typical sensitivities of the three interferometers in the S5 data run (November 2005 -September 2007), along with the target curve. As seen, the final S5 sensitivities of the two 4-km interferometers did indeed reach the target curve over a broad band and easily achieved the design band-limited strain in the best (non-contiguous because of 60-Hz harmonics) 100-Hz band. These measured sensitivities depend in part on a model of the interferometer response to gravitational waves [134], but primarily upon stimulus-response calibration. Three distinct methods have been used for calibrating LIGO interferometers [135]: 1) calibration of voice coil actuators via fringe counting in a simpler, unlocked Michelson interferometer configuration [136]; 2) frequency modulation of the laser in a 1-arm configuration [137] in which frequency modulation is mapped to length modulation of the cavities; and 3) calibration from photon radiation pressure using an auxiliary laser in the full interferometer  Figure 10: Primary known contributors to the H1 detector noise spectrum [94]. The upper panel shows the displacement noise components, while the lower panel shows sensing noises (note the different frequency scales). In both panels, the black curve is the measured strain noise (same spectrum as in Fig. 11), the dashed gray curve is the design goal, and the cyan curve is the root-square-sum of all known contributors (both sensing and displacement noises). The labeled component curves are summarized in the text and described in more detail in ref. [94]. The known noise sources explain the observed noise very well at frequencies above 150 Hz, and to within a factor of 2 in the 40 -100 Hz band. Spectral peaks are identified as follows: c, calibration line; p, power line harmonic; s, suspension wire vibrational mode; m, mirror (test mass) vibrational mode.

To avoid this problem, an \"output mode cleaner\" (4-mirror bow-tie configuration) was installed between the beam splitter and the photodetector, to ensure that higher-order modes (carrier and sidebands) were filtered out, leaving only a clean Gaussian measure of interferometer light [139,140].

Virgo's mirrors are suspended as 5-stage pendula supported by a 3-legged inverted pendulum [144], a system known as the superattenuator. This extreme seismic isolation permitted Virgo to probe gravitational waves down to \u223c10-20 Hz, in contrast to LIGO's \u223c40-50 Hz.

One possibility pursued aggressively was placing the third interferometer in Australia at the Gingin site [152], but the Australian government declined to provide the funding necessary for civil construction, including buildings, vacuum tube and enclosure, along with vacuum chambers for the optics. Placing the third interferometer in India was proposed in parallel [153], and currently is being pursued seriously enough that installation of the H2 interferometer at Hanford has been suspended and preparations made for transport to India. If all goes well, the Hanford and Livingston interferometers will begin operations in 2015, with the third LIGO interferometer commissioned and operated by the Indian Initiative in Gravitational-wave Observations (IndIGO) by 2020 (although projections for IndIGO are understandably uncertain at this early stage).",

A 100-m prototype interferometer, CLIO (Cryogenic Laser Interferometer Observatory) has operated successfully in a shorter Kamiokande tunnel [155]. Placing the interferometer underground dramatically suppresses noise due to ambient seismic disturbances. The rigid rock in the base of the Kamiokande mountain suffers much smaller displacements due to seismic waves than surface soil. Hence the terrestrial gravity gradients due to motion of rock and soil are much reduced. It is hoped that a first version of KAGRA will be operational for a short run in 2015, followed by a major upgrade to cryogenic mirrors (at 20 K) to reduce thermal noise due to suspensions and internal modes and resumption of operations in 2018. In its final configuration KAGRA is expected to have sensitivity comparable to that of Advanced LIGO.",

These spacecraft were to comprise a double quasi-interferometer system, where each satellite would send a laser to the other two and receive another laser from each, where each laser would be phase locked to the other two, yielding a total of six phase-locked lasers. As discussed above, there are many low-frequency gravitational wave sources expected to be detectable with LISA, and the proposed project has received very favorable review by a number of American and European scientific panels. Nonetheless the project has been turned down by NASA. Subsequently, NASA and ESA have solicited separate and significantly descoped new proposals. The funding prospects for these new proposals are quite uncertain, with ESA having recently passed over a descoped version of LISA called NGO (New Gravitational-wave Observer) in favor of a mission to Jupiter.

The background from supermassive black hole binaries with masses of 10 9\u221210 M at redshifts z \u223c 1 may lie only a factor of a few below current detection sensitivity [169]. Important to this effort are identifying and mitigating systematic uncertainties in pulsar timing, of which some are purely instrumental (e.g., radio observatory clock synchronization), some are terrestrial (e.g., ionosphere effects), and some are astrophysical (e.g., plasma fluctuations in the intervening interstellar medium, variable pulsar torque, and magnetospheric motions of emission regions). A recent assessment [170] concludes that prospects for substantial improvement in current array sensitivity depend primarily on the nature of these astrophysical sources of noise. If dominant noise sources are red and therefore resemble the expected astrophysical background from binary SMBHs, a gravitational wave signal will be harder to establish than if the astrophysical timing noise is predominantly white. In that scenario, to establish firm detection and characterize the gravitational wave background requires 50-100 stable millisecond pulsars, a significant increase over the current total among the three major pulsar timing arrays.",

Searches in data from the early runs (S1-S4, VSR1) will be discussed only briefly. Analyses of LIGO and Virgo data are carried out by joint working groups focusing on four distinct source types: 1) compact binary coalescences (CBC), 2) unmodeled bursts, 3) continuous waves (CW), and 4) stochastic background, in keeping with the waveform categories discussed above in section 2.2. Results from searches for these four source types will be discussed in turn below. It should be kept in mind, however, that these types represent archetypal extremes and that some sources fall between these extremes and can be attacked with complementary methods arising from approaches developed for the extremes. Figure 14 shows a schematic outline of the way in which LIGO and Virgo searches can be broken down. As one moves from left to right on the diagram, waveforms increase in duration, while as one moves from top to bottom, a priori waveform definition decreases. Populating the upper left corner is the extreme of an inspiraling compact binary system of two neutron stars in the regime where corrections to Newtonian orbits can be calculated with great confidence. Populating the upper right corner are isolated, known, non-glitching spinning neutron stars with smooth rotational spindown and measured orientation parameters. Populating the lower left corner of the diagram are supernovae, rapid bursts of gravitational radiation for which phase evolution cannot be confidently predicted, and for which it is challenging to make even coarse spectral predictions. At the bottom right one finds a stochastic, cosmological background of radiation for which phase evolution is random, but with a spectrum stationary in time. Between these extremes can live sources on the left such as the merger phases of a BH-BH coalescence. On the right one finds, for example, an accreting neutron star in a lowmass X-ray binary system where fluctuations in the accretion process lead to unpredictable wandering phase.",

If one knows the precise evolution of the phase, one can apply matched-filter techniques [171] to optimize sensitivity (e.g., highest detection efficiency for a fixed false alarm rate). But as uncertainty increases, one must search over a larger volume of parameter space, in which case the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to achieve a fixed false alarm rate necessarily increases. Roughly speaking, the SNR threshold rises only logarithmically with the number of distinct search templates, but for many searches, the number of templates searched can be greater than 10 13 , leading to a significant degradation in intrinsic achievable sensitivity. In many cases, however, the requirement of coincident detection in two or more interferometers or the requirement of signal coherence among interferometers permits a reduction of signal strain threshold (see section 4.2.4).",

For elliptical orbits, gravitational radiation leads to a more rapid decrease in eccentricity than in semi-major axis [172,9]. It has been pointed out, however, that stellar-mass black holes can be captured in highly elliptical orbits by galactic nuclei, leading possibly to periodic bursts of gravitational radiation, preceding coalescence [173]. In the case of NS-NS systems, it has also been assumed that spin effects can be neglected. Corrections due to black hole spin will be discussed briefly below.",

Although details vary among different interferometers, there is typically a primary gravitational strain channel sampled at 10 kHz or more, accompanied by hundreds or thousands of auxiliary channels that monitor the state of the interferometer and physical environment, to allow assessment of the credibility of any detection candidate in the primary channel.",

Although this approach could, in principle, succeed for very strong gravitational wave signals, it is non-optimum because it fails to exploit the spectral characters of the signal and of the noise. Gravitational wave interferometers have highly non-white sensitivities, as shown, for example, in figure 11. To increase SNR, one should emphasize (weight) signal content near the frequencies of best sensitivity (\u223c100-200 Hz for LIGO & Virgo) and de-emphasize (de-weight) signal content at other frequencies [171].",

The necessity to use spectral weighting of matched-filter templates for the non-white noise spectra has already been discussed. That technique comes from signal processing theory in which it is assumed the data is stationary (or at least can be treated as so over time scales long compared to the waveforms being sought) and Gaussian, e.g., the real and imaginary coefficients in a given frequency bin of a Fourier transform are distributed normally with zero mean and well defined (but frequency-dependent) variance.",

The optics and laser control servos are tuned to minimize stationary noise, but that tuning can lead to non-robustness against changes in the environment or even in the instrument. An important environmental example is ground motion, which can lead to non-linear upconversion of lowfrequency noise into higher-frequency noise in a variety of ways, including modulations of cavity power via wobbling Fabry-Perot mirrors, inducement of Barkhausen noise through interactions of actuation currents and magnets, or shaking of surfaces that scatter laser light back into the interferometer. In some cases such non-Gaussian noise sources are understood and their effects can be modeled, but many artifacts in the time domain (and to a lesser degree in the spectral domain) are not understood at all and must be dealt with in an ad hoc, phenomenological manner. When a \"glitch\" is detected simultaneously in the gravitational wave strain channel and an auxiliary channel and there is no plausible mechanism for a gravitational wave to create the auxiliary-channel glitch, then one can sometimes veto the short interval of strain data affected in one's search. Ideally, a physical mechanism should explain how the glitch in the auxiliary channel affects the strain channel, but sometimes the association is established only statistically from a collection of similar glitches [184]. Considerable effort has gone into carrying out data quality studies, to allow vetoing that is effective and safe (against false dismissal of signals), as discussed in references [185], and used in all LIGO and Virgo searches published to date.",

If, for example, the background glitch rate and duration of glitches in detector 1 are R 1 and \u03b4t 1 (with R 1 \u03b4t 1 1), and detector 2 has corresponding values R 2 and \u03b4t 2 , then the approximate rate of accidental coincidence is",

The technique used most often to date has been time lag (or \"time slide\") background estimation. In this method, one artificially shifts one interferometer's data by a set of time strides that are longer than the duration of signals being sought and measuring the artificial coincidence rate for each time stride. For example, one might shift the data of interferometer 2 by t lag n = n\u03b4t, with n = \u2212N, \u2212(N \u2212 1), ..., \u22121, +1, ..., N \u2212 1, N , giving 2N different rate measures. Thus one has a \"black box\" measure of not only the average rate of accidental coincidence, but also its variance and other measures of statistical distribution.

The first assumption is assumed to hold when detectors are far enough apart on the Earth's surface that there are no appreciable common and undetected environmental disturbances consistent with the light-travel-time between the detectors. For the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, a hypothetical example of such a common disturbance would be a lightning strike in Kansas creating an electromagnetic glitch that affects the electronics or magnets of interferometers at both observatories. In fact, the effects of distant lightning have been measured and found negligible. In addition, magnetometers at each site monitor the environment continuously. A more insidious potential source of correlated transients are the nearly identical controls and data acquisition systems used at these two observatories, which are both clocked by synchronized GPS receivers. The precise synchronization is essential to accurate triangulation of astrophysical sources on the sky, but imperfections in the electronics can lead to false coincidences.",

Hence the distribution of combined significance of the estimated background can be quite distorted, leading to an extraordinarily rare occurrence being ranked as only moderately rare. One solution to this problem of signal contaminating its own background estimate is to exclude single-interferometer \"foreground\" triggers of a given zero-lag candidate from the set of time-lagged triggers used to estimate its own background. That solution is a clean one -if the candidate is indeed a true gravitational wave signal, but it has been argued [143] that such exclusion could itself lead to a bias that overestimates the importance of a coincident candidate, the apparent significance of which stems primarily from one single-detector instrumental glitch. This dilemma in background estimation is not an academic one; a deliberately\"blind\" injection into the LIGO and Virgo detectors in 2010 revealed its importance, as discussed below.",

This issue arises in both transient searches and continuous-wave searches. There are many ways to combine data and many ways to apply individual criteria, making a general quantitative answer difficult, even when making optimistic assumptions about the Gaussianity of the background noise. But as a general rule for Gaussian data, combined detection statistics (especially when combined coherently to exploit phase coherence present in a signal in all detectors and absent in the background noise) is statistically more powerful than requiring that individual detection statistics satisfy individual criteria. To achieve the same false alarm rate in coincidence as in combination typically sacrifices signal detection efficiency for well behaved data.",

The usual reason for this choice is to cope with non-Gaussian detector artifacts. Nominal false alarm probabilities for a combined detection statistic can skyrocket if even one detector misbehaves.",

For example, in LIGO and Virgo searches for coalescences to date, there has been a waveform consistency requirement in the form of an additional \u03c7 2 statistic [186,187] that essentially requires the SNR from different bands of the detector to be consistent, thereby suppressing triggers due to a single spectral artifact.",

The 40-meter's sensitivity was good enough during the data run to detect NS-NS inspirals in most, but not all of our galaxy.

In addition, there have been searches for NS-BH and BH-BH coalescences, sometimes reported in separate publications [198,199,200,201] with divisions based on the assumed mass range of the binary mass components. In particular, searches for high-mass black hole systems require special care -the terminal inspiral frequency is low enough that signals tend to accumulate less SNR in band than a NS-NS inspiral of the same amplitude when entering the band, and the lower-frequency bands (<\u223c200 Hz) are typically more non-Gaussian than higher-frequency bands, leading to more frequent false triggers. Figure 15 shows the most recent LIGO and Virgo limits [143] on coalescence event rates (in units of Mpc \u22123 yr \u22121 ) for NS-NS, NS-BH and BH-BH systems for a total binary system mass up to 25 M as a function of total mass M total , where the individual component masses are allowed to vary uniformly for each M total . The limits on rate per volume decrease dramatically with increasing total mass, since the higher masses can be seen to larger distances. These limits are generic in applying to spinless neutron stars and/or black holes. Figure 15 also shows the resulting marginalized NS-BH limits when one component mass is restricted to the range 1-3 M . Figure 16 shows a comparison [143] of the S6/VSR2/VSR3 limits obtained on NS-NS, NS-BH and BH-BH coalescence rates to the expected rates summarized in ref. [3], assuming a black hole mass of 10 M . Limits remain 2-3 orders of magnitude above realistic expectations and about ten times higher than optimistic rate estimates. Table 4 shows specific sample numerical rate limits from ref.

Reconstruction of the most likely locations on the sky included a region in the constellation Canis Major, leading to the informal dubbing of the event as the \"Big Dog\". It was known in advance that \"blind\" signal injections might be made into the LIGO and Virgo data by a small team sworn to silence until an eventual \"opening of the envelope.\" While the signal was strong enough to convince nearly everyone relatively quickly that it was either a genuine astrophysical event or a blind injection, there were a number of non-trivial issues to address: the evidence for a signal in Virgo data was much weaker, and its statistical significance sensitive to how the trigger was combined with data from H1 and L1. There was a substantial glitch nine seconds prior to the trigger in L1, which led to a worry of a coincidental artifact. Parameter estimation studies found better agreement of the measured waveform with a lower order phase model than with the most advanced phase model available. Despite these small inconsistencies and mildly nagging worries, LIGO and Virgo scientists wrote a polished journal article and voted to submit it for publication if the envelope proved to be empty. In the end, of course, the envelope was not empty. The signal was indeed an injected coalescence, and some of the puzzles seen in parameter reconstruction turned out to arise from slightly out-of-date software used in the blind injection.",

In this case the foreground triggers were those outliers seen in true coincidence in the H1 and L1 interferometers that led to the combined Big Dog candidate. The difference in estimated false alarm rates turned out to be substantial. Combining the (louder) H1 foreground trigger with background (time-lagged) L1 triggers led to a conservatively estimated false alarm rate of 1 in 7,000 years. It was not feasible to estimate accurately the false alarm rate when excluding the H1 foreground trigger (i.e., using only H1 background triggers) simply because no lagged-coincidence candidates were found to give as high a combined significance as the Big Dog candidate. Figure 17 shows the background estimates with and without including the two H1 and L1 foreground triggers. An extrapolation of the foreground-less background estimate suggests (but does not establish!) a false alarm rate about two orders of magnitude lower than 1 in 7,000 years. The Big Dog exercise was an extreme one in the effort and time devoted to the analysis and writing of results. But it proved valuable in preparing the collaborations for not only the technical difficulties in signal detection in multiple interferometers of differing sensitivities and with different idiosyncrasies, but also for confronting the ambiguities and philosophical issues that arise in establishing a true discovery. A professional sociologist who has been \"embedded\" in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration for many years has documented the Big Dog in a forthcoming volume [203], that continues a recording of the ongoing process toward eventual gravitational wave detection [204].",

These searches attempt to be \"eyes wide open\" in the sense that a variety of different and unpredictable waveforms could be detected with reasonable efficiency. Several approaches have been tried, with the community now converging on coherent multidetector algorithms that strongly favor consistency among the data sets, but allow for a broad family of such waveforms. Because one cannot safely apply only matched-filter techniques in these generic searches, one is more subject to false alarms from instrumental artifacts than, for example, in NS-NS coalescence searches. Since the LIGO instruments are intended to behave identically, they tend to be subject to the same classes of glitch phenomena, making work in data quality studies and vetoing all the more critical. In addition to using external triggers to focus on interesting intervals of data to scrutinize, LIGO and Virgo scientists have also begun collaboration with other astronomical collaborations (electromagnetic and neutrino) to provide prompt triggers based on results of the all-sky searches, to allow independent confirmation of transient detection and to permit better understanding of source astrophysics. The effort to use external electromagnetic and neutrino detections to trigger follow-up gravitational wave searches and vice-versa is part of what has come to be known as multi-messenger astronomy.",

In addition, a small family of numerical relativity-derived waveforms [212] of neutron star collapse to a black hole were also used to evaluate performance, again, via detector efficiency vs. h rss . Over the last decade the burst search algorithms have steadily improved, as measured by detection efficiency vs. h rss , localization of sources on the sky and robustness against noise artifacts. LIGO's second all-sky burst search introduced wavelet decomposition (Waveburst) of the data as an alternative to a strictly Fourier treatment [213]. The deliberate admixture of time and frequency content embodied in wavelets is well suited to the problem of recovering transient waveforms in data with a smoothly varying band sensitivity. There were additional improvements in pre-search data conditioning, to remove stationary and quasi-stationary spectral lines, along with more comprehensive veto studies and waveform consistency tests based on cross-correlation [214]. Similar searches using the Waveburst program were carried out in the data of the next three LIGO data runs (S2-S4) [215,216,217].",

The regulation was motivated by single-detector glitches that could be construed as true gravitational wave signals coming from a particular source location and orientation that leads to a small antenna pattern sensitivity for all but one detector. For example, an intrinsically strong source lying near the bisector of a LIGO interferometer's arms would appear weak to that interferometers, but possibly strong to the Virgo detector. While physically possible, such events are rare, and suppressing them leads to a small (and measurable) reduction in efficiency while greatly mitigating false alarms due to instrumental artifacts. In addition, two alternative algorithmic approaches had evolved in parallel for use on the S5 data: BlockNormal, described in [219] and Q-Pipeline, described in [220].",

With an electromagnetic (or neutrino) trigger, one has not only a relatively small time window to search, but also a direction on the sky with a known antenna pattern sensitivity for each detector for any given assumed polarization.

            "text": "The first triggered burst search carried out with major interferometers was for a coincidence between GRB 030329 (March 2003 coincided with the LIGO S2 data run) and excess power in the Hanford H1 (4km) and H2 (2-km) interferometers which were operational during the burst's electromagnetic detection. The search was based on excess power in the cross-correlation [228] between the H1 and H2 data in a three-minute time window, starting two minutes before the detection of the gamma rays by the HETE-2 satellite [229]. This relatively large time window was meant to be conservative, to reflect potential uncertainties in gamma ray burst emission models. Naively, one would expect the gravitational wave burst's arrival at the Earth to precede that of the gamma rays slightly, as they are likely secondary particles [230]. Although this GRB was one of the closest with an established redshift from an optical counterpart [231], it was nonetheless approximately 800 Mpc distant, making its detection extremely unlikely, especially with the interferometers of S2 sensitivity [232]. No signal was seen, and upper limits on h rss as low as \u223c 6 \u00d7 10 \u221221 Hz \u2212 1 2 for sine-Gaussian waveforms were placed. Subsequent searches for gravitational wave bursts coincident with detected gamma ray bursts have detected no signals [233,234,235,236], as expected, given detector sensitivities to date. Recent searches [234,236] for GW bursts coincident with gamma ray bursts have been carried out with the X-Pipeline [237], which uses coherent network measures of coherent and incoherent strain energy detected, along with automated threshold tuning based on measured (non-stationary) noise characteristics. In addition, explicit searches for compact binary coalescences coincident with the GRBs have been carried out [235,236] An especially interesting gamma ray burst was GRB 070201, a short hard gamma ray burst with a reconstructed position consistent with M31 (Andromeda). The absence of any plausible signal in LIGO data [238] at the time of the burst and the nearness of M31 make it very unlikely that the GRB was a binary merger in M31. More likely it was an SGR giant flare in M31. Another interesting event coincident with LIGO data taking was GRB051103 which had a triangulated position consistent with the relatively nearby M81 galaxy (\u223c 3.6 Mpc). Again, no evidence was seen [239] of a gravitational wave burst, strongly suggesting this burst was another giant flare, making it the most distant flare detected. A much closer giant flare [42] in December 2004 of SGR 1806-20 prompted a search in LIGO data [240] from the H1 and H2 detectors, which were operating in an astrowatch mode at the time. No signal was seen, allowing upper limits on the gravitational energy emitted in the flare to be placed of O(10 \u22128 M c 2 ), comparable to the electromagnetic energy emitted by the galactic neutron star (see also ref. [241] for a search in Auriga data). Other searches for soft gamma ray repeaters have been carried out in S5 data [242], and a special search [243] was carried out for the 2006 storm of SGR 1900+14 [244], using stacking of LIGO data for individual bursts in the storm. Additional electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars were used as triggers for gravitational wave searches in LIGO, Virgo and GEO 600 data from November 2006 to June 2009 [245]. Similarly, a search [246] was carried out in LIGO data for a gravitational wave burst coincident with a glitch in the Vela pulsar in August 2006. Finally, a search [247] was carried out in LIGO and Virgo data for gravitational wave bursts coincident with high energy triggers in the Antares underwater neutrino detector [248].",

            "text": "A critical consideration in sending out an alert is the directional resolution of the gravitational wave candidate. To lowest order, that directionality comes simply from triangulation based on time delays among the interferometers. As discussed in section 3.2, a physically allowed time delay and uncertainty between a pair of non-colocated interferometers defines a annular ring on the sky. The intersections of those annuli for all possible detector pairs define preferred regions to search. To next order, one can use the antenna patterns associated with the different interferometer orientations to favor one or more intersections over others. The formalism for such triangulation was worked out in some detail by Gursel & Tinto in 1989 [259] and has received intensive study in recent years with the active collaboration among major interferometers worldwide and with the prospect of moving one of the advanced LIGO interferometers to Australia or India (see section 3.4 above). A number of algorithmic approaches have been tried, including that of Coherent Waveburst [218], described above, in addition to \u2126-Pipeline [220]. Achieved spatial resolutions vary with signal SNR and location, but a rough estimate for low-SNR signals that could have been seen in the S6/VSR2-3 run was as much as tens of square degrees. Because an area that large is not well matched to the fields of view of partner telescopes, ranked tiles on the sky were provided to assist in prioritizing observing time, where ranking could depend on not only SNR-based likelihood, but also on the existence in a tile of a nearby galaxy.",

The relatively poor directionality possible with only the two LIGO detectors made release of triggers unattractive during the S6 period between VSR2 and VSR3. The second observing run for external trigger release took place from September 2, 2010 to October 20, 2010, coinciding with the end of the S6 run. Two trigger pipelines were used, one based on the Coherent Waveburst program, the other based on a low-latency coalescence detection baseline called Multi Band Templated Analysis (MBTA) [260]. Two candidates were detected by the Waveburst program, one on January 7, 2010 and one on September 16, 2010, which was the Big Dog blind injection discussed above in section 4.2.6.. Three candidates were detected with the MBTA program and judged to have enough scientific potential to release triggers to partners. One of the MBTA triggers arrived during a test period and was not sent to partners. Another trigger on October 6, 2010 had a sky location too close to the Sun to permit follow-up. The remaining trigger, which occurred on September 19, 2010, was released to partners. Results of its image analysis will appear in a forthcoming publication. Typical delays between apparent signal arrival and the decision on trigger release during the run varied from about 20 to 40 minutes. Not all partner telescopes (distributed worldwide) were positioned to observe favored sky locations for all triggers (or to observe at all if in daylight). The infrastructure used in the MBTA-based pipeline is described in detail in ref. [261], and the results of the Swift follow-up exercise described in ref. [262]. Further publications based on the follow-up exercise with ground-based telescopes are planned.",

It is useful to classify CW searches into three broad categories [21]: 1) targeted searches in which the star's position and rotation frequency are known, i.e., known radio, X-ray or \u03b3-ray pulsars; 2) directed searches in which the star's position is known, but rotation frequency is unknown, e.g., a non-pulsating X-ray source at the center of a supernova remnant; and 3) all-sky searches for unknown neutron stars. The parameter space over which to search increases in large steps as one progresses through these categories. In each category a star can be isolated or binary.

Hence a relatively large number of CW searches were carried out with both bar detectors and interferometer prototypes in the decades before the major 1st-generation interferometers began collecting data, as summarized in ref. [263]. The most sensitive of the resulting upper limits came from bar detectors in their narrow bands of sensitivity. The Explorer detector reported [264] an upper limit on spindownless CW signals from the galactic center of 2.9\u00d710 \u221224 in a 0.06-Hz band near 921 Hz, based on 96 days of observation. A broader-band (\u223c1 Hz) upper limit of 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u221223 was also reported [265] from the Explorer detector based on a coherent 2-day search that allowing for stellar spindown. In addition, searches for spindownless CW waves from the galactic center and from the pulsar-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae in two 1-Hz bands near 900 Hz were carried out in Allegro detector data, yielding upper limits [266] of 8 \u00d7 10 \u221224 . Finally, a narrowband (0.05 Hz) search [267] was carried out with the TAMA interferometer near 935 Hz for continuous waves from the direction of Supernova 1987A, with an upper limit of 5 \u00d7 10 \u221223 reported.",

Comparable upper limits were obtained from the (frequentist) F -statistic method described in section 4.4.2. Later applications of this method included a variety of improvements, including coherent treatment of multiple interferometers, marginalization over noise parameters and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search method for parameter estimation. At the same time the number of stars searched in each data run increased, along with closer partnership with radio and X-ray astronomers who provided ephemerides. In the S2 data, limits were placed on 28 pulsars, with a lowest strain limit of 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u221224 . In the S3 and S4 data (analyzed jointly), limits were placed on 78 pulsars, with a lowest strain limit of 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u221225 .

Because the number of required distinct points on the sky scales like 1/(\u03b4\u03b8) 2 , the number of search templates scales like (T coh ) 2 (f s ) 2 for a fixed signal frequency f s . Now consider attempting a search with a coherence time of 1 year for a signal frequency f s = 1 kHz. One obtains \u03b4\u03b8 \u223c 0.3 \u00b5rad and a total number of sky points to search of O(10 14 ) -again, for a fixed frequency. Adding in the degrees of freedom to search over ranges in f s ,\u1e1f s andf s makes a fully coherent 1-year all-sky search utterly impractical, given the Earth's present computing capacity. As a result, tradeoffs in sensitivity must be made to achieve tractability in all-sky searches. The simplest tradeoff is to reduce the observation time to a manageable coherence time, as was done in an all-sky search in the 2-month LIGO S2 data (160-730 Hz) based on the F -statistic algorithm, using a coherence time of 10 hours [286]. It can be more attractive, however, to reduce the coherence time still further to the point where the total observation time is divided into N = T obs /T coh , segments, each of which is analyzed coherently and the results added incoherently to form a detection statistic. One sacrifices intrinsic sensitivity per segment in the hope of compensating (partially) with the increased statistics from being able to use more total data. This approach has been used extensively in all-sky searches. One finds a strain sensitivity (threshold for detection) that scales as the inverse fourth root of N [285]. Hence, for a fixed observation time, the sensitivity degrades as N 1 4 as T coh decreases. This degradation is a price one pays for not preserving phase coherence over the full observation time, in order to make the search computationally tractable.",

One algorithm is a direct implementation of this idea called StackSlide [288]. Another implementation [289] is based on the Hough transform approach [290], in which for each segment a detection statistic is compared to a threshold and given a weight of 0 or 1. The sums of those weights are accumulated in parameter space \"maps,\" with high counts warranting follow-up. The Hough approach offers, in principle, somewhat greater computational efficiency from reducing floating point operations, but its greater utility lies in its robustness against non-Gaussian artifacts [284]. A third implementation, known as PowerFlux [291], improves upon the StackSlide method by weighting segments by the inverse variance of the estimated (usually non-stationary) noise and by searching explicitly over different assumed polarizations while including the antenna pattern correction factors in the noise weighting. A comparison of these three algorithms on the S4 data [284] established a somewhat better detection efficiency for the PowerFlux approach, as one would expect. (More recent work on an alternative approach to the Hough algorithm suggests improved efficiency can be achieved [292].)",

All three of the above semi-coherent methods were used to produce all-sky upper limits in the 50-1000 band of the LIGO S4 data [284]. The PowerFlux algorithm was used to produce all-sky upper limits in the 50-1100 Hz band of the first eight months of LIGO S5 data [293]. The sheer length of data for the full 23-month S5 run required substantial upgrade of the program which was then used to produce all-sky upper limits in the 50-800 Hz band of the full data set. Figure 21 shows these S5 upper limits based on a total of more than 80,000 (50%-overlapped) 30-minute segments from the H1 and L1 data. In this strict frequentist analysis the highest 95% CL upper limit obtained from every sky point searched is shown for the best-case (circular polarization) and worst-case (linear polarization) assumption for the source orientation. The most recent PowerFlux result [294] included a follow-up procedure of loud candidates, based on a \"loose coherence\" which allows continuous adjustment of the assumed degree of coherence among Fourier transforms of successive segments of data [295].",

            "text": "These three semi-coherent algorithms compute a detection statistic based on the strain powers measured in short (30-minute) segments, times over which frequency modulation effects can be neglected [for a skygrid compatible with equation (94)]. Another approach is to use much longer segments and construct a coherent demodulated power estimate, using the F -statistic algorithm. This approach has been taken by the Einstein@Home project. Using the same software infrastructure (BOINC) [296] developed for the Seti@Home project [297], Einstein@Home encourages volunteers to download narrowband segments of LIGO data and carry out a semi-coherent F -statistic search over a small patch of sky. Results are automatically returned to an Einstein@Home server and recorded, with every set of templates analyzed independently by host computers owned by at least two different volunteers. LIGO scientists then carry out post-processing to follow up on promising outliers found. This project has been remarkably successful in engaging the public (\u223c225,000 volunteers and \u223c750,000 host computers to date) in forefront science while making good use of idle computer cycles to carry out searches that would otherwise exceed the capacity of available LIGO and Virgo computers. Two searches have been published to date, one on the LIGO S4 data set [298] and one on the early LIGO S5 data [299], both of which achieved comparable sensitivity to other semi-coherent searches while exploring a significantly larger frequency band (the total computing cost of an all-sky search is roughly proportional to the cube of the upper frequency bound). Technical constraints in transferring data to host computers and running on a large variety of computing platforms have limited achievable sensitivity in previous searches, but new approaches promise improved performance in future searches [300,301]. In addition, the eventual incorporation of automated follow-up of outliers on host computers offers the prospect of fully automated discovery of new continuous wave sources and greatly streamlined post-processing. It should be noted that the Einstein@Home infrastructure and user base, developed originally for gravitational wave searches, has now been used successfully to detect pulsars in radio data from the Arecibo PALFA survey [302] and is being used in searches for gamma-ray pulsars in data from the Fermi satellite [303]. In addition, some of the search techniques developed for gravitational wave analysis (hierarchical stages of coherent and semi-coherent methods, along with systematic search template placement) have been used to improve gamma ray search algorithms and have led to new pulsar discoveries [303,304].",

An early F -statistic-based search analyzed six hours of LIGO S2 data [286], using an explicit set of templates in the gravitational wave frequency bands 464-484 Hz and 604-624 Hz as well as the two relevant binary circular orbit parameters of the projected semi-major axis (in light-seconds) and an orbital reference time for the star to cross the ascending node of the orbit. This pioneering and computationally limited analysis chose the two restricted search bands based on the drift range of observed quasi-periodic X-ray oscillations [286]. More recent searches for Sco X-1 have been carried out using cross-correlation methods in directional searches for stochastic radiation, as described below in section 4.5.2. A potentially more powerful method based on incoherent summing of orbital sidebands from a coherent search over many orbital periods has also been proposed [306], along with a frequency-demodulated cross correlation method [282].",

Two methods have been proposed for carrying out such an all-sky binary search, which approach the problem from opposite extremes. The first method, known as TwoSpect [307] carries out a semi-coherent search over an observation time long compared to the maximum orbital period considered. Fourier transforms are carried out over each row (fixed frequency bin) in a \u223cyear-long spectrogram and the resulting frequency-frequency plot searched for characteristic harmonic patterns. The second method, known as Polynomial [308], searches coherently using matched filters over an observation time short compared to the minimum orbital period considered. A bank of frequency polynomials in time is used for creating the matched filters, where for a small segment of an orbit, the frequency should vary as a low-order polynomial.",

It should be noted that the time lag method of background estimation used extensively in coalescence and burst searches is also used in stochastic searches as an independent cross check. A good introduction to these issues can be found in the first LIGO publication [75] reporting an upper limit on an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background from the S1 science run. That first limit was an astrophysically uninteresting level of \u2126 0 < 46 (assuming recent H 0 determinations), but the search served as a valuable pioneering exercise in both data analysis and detector diagnostics for the much more sensitive searches to follow. With succeeding science runs, the limits on the quantity \u2126 0 in the LIGO band of best isotropic stochastic sensitivity (exact band is run-dependent because of frequency-dependent sensitivity improvements) decreased to 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 in the S3 data [317], to 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the S4 data [318], and to 6.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 in the S5 data [80]. Figure 4 (discussed in section 2.6) shows the S4 and S5 limits superposed together with expectation ranges from different possible backgrounds and limits derived from other Figure 23: Strain amplitude spectral noise densities of the individual LIGO interferometers (S5 data) compared to the upper limits (\u223c100 \u00d7 lower) placed on a stochastic gravitational wave background by cross-correlating the interferometer data [80].",

Top row: Signal-to-noise ratio sky maps for three different directional searches for stochastic gravitational radiation: spherical harmonic decomposition for \u03b2 = \u22123 (left) and \u03b2 = 0 (center); and radiometer point-source search for \u03b2 = 0 (right) [324]. Bottom row: The corresponding 90% CL upper limit maps on strain power in units of strain 2 Hz \u22121 sr \u22121 for the spherical harmonic decomposition, and units of strain 2 Hz \u22121 for the radiometer search.",

Projected sensitivities of the satellite-based Planck CMBR experiment and LISA GW detector are also shown. The pulsar bound is based on the fluctuations in the pulse arrival times of millisecond pulsars and applies at frequencies around 10 \u22128 Hz. Measurements of the CMBR at large angular scales constrain the possible redshift of CMBR photons due to a stochastic gravitational wave background, and therefore limit the amplitude of that background at largest wavelengths (smallest frequencies).
