            "text": "Over the last decade, there has been enormous effort to measure neutrino interaction cross sections important to oscillation experiments. However, a number of results from modern experiments appear to be in tension with each other, despite purporting to measure the same processes. The TENSIONS2016 workshop was held at University of Pittsburgh July 24-31, 2016 and was sponsored by the Pittsburgh High Energy Physics, Astronomy, and Cosmology Center (PITT-PACC). The focus was on bringing experimentalists from three experiments together to compare results in detail and try to find the source of tension by clarifying and comparing signal definitions and the analysis strategies used for each measurement. A set of comparisons between the measurements using a consistent set of models was also made. This paper summarizes the main conclusions of that work.",

            "text": "Current and planned neutrino oscillation experiments operate in the 0.1-10 GeV energy range, and use heavy nuclear targets (typically 12 C, 16 O or 40 Ar). This energy range corresponds to a difficult \"transition region\" in the neutrino interaction cross section. Interactions include (quasi-)elastic which occur on a constituent nucleon within the nucleus at lower energies and excitation of a nucleon resonance at intermediate energies which leads to meson production. At higher energies, interactions occur predominantly on constituent quarks within the nucleons. Numerous results from MiniBooNE [1], MINERvA [2], and T2K [3,4] are published or in progress. A recent review [5] discusses the overall situation at length. Figure 1 shows the flux distributions from the MINERvA cross section experiment and the T2K and MiniBooNE oscillation/cross section experiments used in this study and the planned DUNE experiment, compared to the charged current (CC) cross section taken from the NuWro neutrino interaction generator [6]. The NuWro prediction is also shown broken down into exclusive channels, or modes, which have strong neutrino energy dependence. It is clear that modeling the transition between these interaction modes is important for neutrino oscillation experiments, which all have broad neutrino flux distributions.",

The initial momentum of nucleons within the nucleus and the energy required to liberate them are not negligible compared to the momentum and energy transfer in the interaction, so cannot be neglected. Furthermore, additional nuclear screening effects, or additional interactions where the initial hard scatter is with more than one nucleon further complicate the problem.",

Because of FSI, it is not possible to unambiguously separate interaction modes in an experiment, it is only possible to measure the post-FSI final state particle content. For example, a charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) interaction, \u03bd l + n \u2192 l \u2212 + p, may only produce a single visible charged lepton in a detector, and is indistinguishable from a single pion production interaction where the pion is absorbed in the nucleus. As a result, defining a measurement as CC0\u03c0 (one lepton, no final state pions) may more accurately represent what is being measured. However, CC0\u03c0 is a more complicated signal definition, which may be more challenging for theorists E \u03bd (GeV) ",

Additionally, different detector technologies have different capabilities, most notably due to hadron energy thresholds. What is visible in one experiment may not be in another and a different signal definition may be required. Requiring a proton in the signal can have significant consequences in backgrounds encountered and physics to which the measurement is sensitive.

MiniBooNE provided the first high statistics measurements for charged current \u03bd \u00b5 [11] and \u03bd \u00b5 [12] and E \u03bd \u223c1 GeV, which first indicated a problem with CCQE, or CCQE-like modeling, as both shape and magnitude of the total CCQE cross section was in conflict with earlier NOMAD results [13] at higher energies. Subsequent MINERvA results at intermediate energies without protons [14,15] and with protons [16,17] did not fully support the increase in the magnitude of the cross section seen by MiniBooNE. Although the MiniBooNE discrepancy was not settled, new high quality data at a broad range in Q 2 became available, motivating systematic investigations into the available models. In Ref. [18], members of the T2K collaboration used a number of models for CCQE and 2p2h processes which had been implemented in the NEUT generator, and fit the available QE-like data from MiniBooNE and MINERvA. The two experiments were in considerable tension in the context of the models tested, indicating disagreement between the datasets. Adding to the confusion, both results seem to be consistent with a need for 2p2h with the preliminary calculations available. Subsequently, T2K has published new measurements of CC0\u03c0 [19] which uses a series of calculations (described in this document) to show the importance of 2p2h. These measurements, and the apparent tension between them, are discussed in Section III. Due to time constraints, we focus on the charged current \u03bd \u00b5 results.",

They provide (in principle) a model for all possible interactions for a given measurement with which analyses can be developed, provide a way to estimate the efficiency for the signal selection, and provide a model for background processes, and tools to estimate systematic uncertainties on the models. Experimental publications compare results with theoretical models, although this is often limited to those available in the generator used to analyze the data. As experiments use different generators, comparison between experiments can be difficult. Because of the choice each experiment makes for the event generator, they must assess systematic errors resulting from the resulting model dependence. The NUISANCE software [34] has been developed to facilitate comparisons between all neutrino interaction generators and the available data, and has been used to make the model comparisons shown in this work. An introduction to the generators considered is given in Section II. Comparisons with both older and recent Monte Carlo codes are presented in Sections III and IV.",

The workshop focused on possible reasons for the apparent disagreements between the measurements made in the QE-like and single pion production channels. It had a novel format where very few formal talks were scheduled and the emphasis was on producing ways to compare results. This format was new to neutrino physics and the experiences are part of the report. The primary aims of the workshop were to: clarify the signal definition, methodology and models used by each experiment; explore previously unappreciated model dependence in the results; and prepare new comparisons between interaction models to each experiment unavailable to the collaborations at the time the measurement was made. Members of three collaborations (T2K, MINERvA, MiniBooNE) and experts from the generator community attended the workshop. Each experiment provided supplementary simulation files which included new information about the efficiency and selection cuts used for each measurement. Each experiment also provided their neutrino interaction flux information, which was used to generate various MC samples corresponding to the models used for each analysis, as well as a suite of new models unavailable at the time of the respective publications.",

All generators which are commonly found in the current cross section literature are considered. The most widely used generators, GENIE [35] and NEUT [36], are primarily maintained by experimentalists in addition to their normal work. Generator models are taken from theoretical papers; the process can be greatly expedited when the theory model authors can offer advice. Generator authors often make similar model choices, but the implementation can be very different because of parameter and model adjustments; Ref. [37] includes many plots showing these problems. Because these generators are used for full detector simulations by experiments, emphasis is necessarily put on covering all regions of phase-space, and having many model choices available, even if this introduces some inconsistency. The necessity of including systematic uncertainties for experimental applications also makes it a challenge to include sophisticated new models quickly. nuance [38] falls in the same category, although it is no longer actively maintained, and as such has not been used in recent years. GiBUU [39] and NuWro [6] have better theoretical bases, and are therefore more consistent models. They are frequently used to benchmark the less sophisticated generators. NuWro typically introduces new interaction level models quickly, and NEUT and GENIE often benefit by migrating these new models into their frameworks. NuWro is being updated for use in full detector simulations, e.g. a parameter reweighting framework has been recently introduced [40]. GiBUU differs from the other generators primarily by the treatment of the nuclear potential and intranuclear particle transport model. Detailed discussion of the models implemented in each generator can be found in the following subsections.",

            "text": "Using the local Fermi gas nuclear model, the Valencia group has constructed a consistent model for QE-like interactions. The QE models by Nieves et al. [43,44], includes long-range nucleonnucleon (RPA) correlations and Coulomb effects for the outgoing muon on single-nucleon (1p1h or true QE) and multi-nucleon (2p2h) interactions. The Valencia multi-nucleon interaction (2p2h) model [45] is widely used because Gran and Sanchez [46] studied its features and application with the theory authors. It is included as a distinct interaction channel which explicitly incorporates additional nucleons in the final state. Broader applicability is gained by deleting events for which q 3 > 1.2 GeV, where q 3 is the magnitude of the momentum transfer. Final state nucleons are distributed via phase space [47]; the isospin decomposition of the nucleons in the final is an ongoing problem. Although some theoretical models have interference between 1-and 2-body currents, this is not true for this model. Ref. [30] Model choices are briefly summarized for single pion production in Table II. At the core of most generator resonance models is the Rein-Sehgal [52] (R-S) model, which was developed to model neutrino interactions over 30 years ago, and is convenient to implement in generators. The resonance parameters have changed significantly as the data improved. It uses a non-relativistic quark model [58] to derive helicity amplitudes to produce resonances, and then models the subsequent decay of those resonances. Berger-Sehgal [54] updated the R-S model to include effects due to lepton mass. Resonance parameters such as masses, decay widths, and form factors have been updated by all generator groups. GiBUU, which has a resonance model grounded in electron-scattering measurements [59] and NuWro [57] have done independent fits to the nucleon data. There are a variety of ways to describe nonresonant pion production [5]; strength can come from the tail of DIS process which we label as scaled B-Y (Bodek-Yang [55]) or via low order diagrams [44]. The scaled B-Y choice uses a factor that decreases model strength to get agreement with data; it then includes both resonant and nonresonant processes. Interference between resonant and nonresonant amplitudes is difficult for all generators and ignored by most simulations. It is difficult to describe these effects accurately. Final state interactions are often modeled using the Salcedo-Oset [56] intranuclear cascade model, tuned to pion-nucleus and nucleon-nucleus scattering data. It includes medium corrections via a local density approximation. Again the exception is GiBUU, which has a more sophisticated treatment introduced below. Versions of GENIE code used here have a data-driven model [35] which has no medium dependence.",

For all versions, the effect of the lepton masses on the allowed region of phase space is taken into account. v2.12.0alt fully includes Berger-Sehgal lepton-mass corrections [68] and the pion-pole diagram. In default versions, the axial and vector form factors are the modified dipole forms as in the original Rein-Sehgal model; in GENIE v2.12.0alt, the \u2206 form factors have been updated from fits to Mini-BooNE data [22]. While the \u2206 \u2192 \u03c0 decay is isotropic for early versions of GENIE, v2.12.0alt uses the angular distribution from Rein-Sehgal [52]. Note that in all versions of GENIE, interferences between resonances are neglected, the non-resonant contribution to single pion production comes from scaled versions of the Bodek-Yang [55] model, with hadronization described by the custom AKGY model [53].",

This results in a reduction of the single pion production cross section, and an increase in the CCQE-like cross section. Additional nucleons were simulated at the vertex to model the \u03c0-less \u2206-decay events. In NEUT 5.3.6, the Valencia multi-nucleon interaction model [44,46] is included as a distinct interaction channel which explicitly includes additional nucleons in the final state.

The main theoretical formalism uses W \u00b1 , Z exchange for weak interactions and \u03b3 exchange for electromagnetic interactions. Therefore, there are many similarities in kinematic quantities used. The exchanged boson has a 4-vector q with energy (q 0 = \u03bd) and 3-momentum (| q| = q 3 ) components. The invariant mass of the transferred boson is Q 2 = \u2212|q \u00b5 | 2 = q 2 3 \u2212q 2 0 and the total hadronic mass in the rest frame is W . Neutrino experiments use beams with broad distributions in neutrino energy, which means that the neutrino energy must be calculated for each event, as opposed to being known a priori, as in the case of electron-scattering experiments. All measurements discussed in this work are charged current (CC), i.e. exchanged W \u00b1 . All experiments measure the muon energy and angle in the lab; a growing number of experiments measure the properties of the hadrons in the final state. The beam energy (E \u03bd ), 4-momentum transfer (Q 2 ), and its components (q 0 , q 3 ) must all be calculated from the measurements of the final state. Model dependence is unfortunately an important part of every experiment and therefore an important part of the studies in this report. All experiments estimate a large set of systematic errors which are meant to account for these effects.",

Containment was enforced by requiring the observation of a decay Michel electron found near the end of the projected stopping point of the muon candidate, and no activity in the outer veto region. The detection efficiency is around 30%; kinematic acceptance losses are dominated by the containment requirement on muon direction and energy. The detector is spherically symmetric, and the detector modeling and reconstruction algorithms were validated against the ubiquitous muon flux provided by cosmic rays both traversing and stopping inside the detector, as described in Ref. [88]. Final-state positively charged pions are tagged and excluded by the observation of an additional decay electron. Neutral pions decay promptly to two photons which produce Cherenkov rings, which are also rejected. However, the majority of protons are below Cherenkov threshold and so are not controlled in the analysis. Therefore, the definition for CCQE-like interactions in MiniBooNE analyses is a single muon, no pions, and any number of outgoing nucleons.",

First, events which originate within the MINERvA detector fiducial volume are required to have a muon in the MINERvA detector that matches spatially and temporally to a muon in the MINOS near detector, which is used for muon spectroscopy. This requirement imposes a geometrical restriction on the acceptance of events into the analysis sample. Next, a cut is made to exclude events with reconstructed neutrino energy outside of the signal range, 1.5 GeV< E QE \u03bd <10 GeV, where E QE \u03bd was defined in Equation 1. At the time of the analysis, the reference GENIE MC had no model for 2p2h, so the signal efficiency was calculated for true, nucleon-level, GENIE CCQE only. In order to retain 2p2h events in the selection, the analysis is blind to a region around the vertex wide enough to contain protons and neutrons (pions) with kinetic energy less than 225 (100) MeV. Outside this region, a maximum of two isolated groups of spatially contiguous energy deposition are allowed, which can be created either by protons exiting the region or through secondary interactions. A cut on the total calorimetric energy deposited outside the vertex energy region (the recoil energy) is implemented as a function of Q 2",

At the time of the analysis, there was no 2p2h model available to MINERvA; the general insight at the time was that 2p2h would produce low-momentum protons, and so the analysis was designed to avoid sensitivity to that region. In this work, we compare CCQE+2p2h models to the MINERvA dataset.

The T2K and MiniBooNE signal definition is based on the topology of CC0\u03c0, with no charged or neutral pions, but any number of nucleons in the final state. For both detectors there is a high threshold for proton detection, or neutrons through secondary interactions in the detector which would produce a visible proton. Since final state pions can be detected, CC0\u03c0 is a natural signal choice. One advantage of this insensitivity to final state nucleons is that the efficiency for 1p1h and 2p2h processes should be similar; this is useful because we know that 2p2h processes should contribute. However, there were no appropriate models implemented in generators when the analyses considered here were carried out. For the calorimetric MINERvA detector, the choice of signal definition is less simple. The response of the detector to CC1\u03c0 + interactions with and without pion absorption is similar, as the hadronic (non-vertex recoil) energy is reconstructed as the calorimetric sum regardless of final state particle content. If MINERvA had tried to do an analysis like MiniBooNE, where the signal definition included CC1\u03c0 + with pion absorption and CCQE, the analysis would have mixed two very different signal populations with different efficiencies, which can bring in model dependence in the efficiency correction. In addition, the cuts on the hadronic energy were designed to allow 2p2h events into the signal selection, but with no 2p2h model in the generator, the 1p1h efficiency had to be assumed. As such, the MINERvA signal is 2p2h enhanced, but the validity of describing the signal as 1p1h + 2p2h is not clear.",

Further, a pion produced in a nucleus which is later absorbed inside the same nucleus must be considered signal in most single arm measurements. Two strategies to deal with this complexity include redefining the signal at CC0\u03c0 and/or detecting the outgoing nucleon (proton for \u03bd \u00b5 experiments). We note there are challenges with both approaches. Using a signal using only final state particles avoids the necessity for model dependent FSI corrections. Using a CC0\u03c0 signal makes it difficult for theoretical models (not true for generators) as the contribution of CC1\u03c0 with pion absorption through FSI must be added to the prediction.",

By defining the signal as CC0\u03c0, corrections for FSI effects are avoided. A double differential cross section is measured as a function of muon kinematics (momentum and angle); efficiency corrections then depend only on the detector reconstruction capabilities and not on the fundamental process (e.g. Q 2 or E \u03bd ) which produced the outgoing muon. Therefore the efficiency corrections are, to a large extent, independent of the MC used to evaluate them, and this is discussed in the following paragraphs. The bins of muon kinematics with very low efficiency may still be potentially affected by model-dependence, but they are well separated by the other bins and comparison to models can be done in restricted parts of the phase space.",

For true variables, the model-dependence is evident because we rely on a particular MC simulation in order to map the observed muon momentum and angle to a particular value of the 'true' variable. The most obvious problem comes from incomplete identification of the final state, e.g. 1p1h vs. 2p2h processes or pion emission followed by absorption. The reconstructed energy can have errors in reconstructed E \u03bd of a few hundred MeV for pion absorption and this error depends on both model choice and reconstruction technique. The model dependence of 'composed' reconstructed variables is more subtle. The efficiency of muon detection is typically not flat as a function of muon momentum and angle due to detector limitations. 'Composed' variables mix muons with different kinematics in the same bin with different efficiencies. In this case it's practically impossible to separate the regions of very low efficiency from the rest of the phase space. This was discovered to be an issue for the T2K analyses with a 1D Q 2 QE distribution. There is also a related issue for measurements which are not completely multi-differential but integrated over one or more of the relevant variables. For instance a one-dimensional measurement as a function of muon momentum involves an integration over muon angle. This will mix events with forward and backward muons which have different efficiency corrections. So, the overall efficiency correction in a given bin of muon momentum depends on the distribution of muon angles inside that bin which must be provided by the MC simulation. The way to avoid this kind of issue is to define restricted regions of phase space in fundamental measured variables (like the muon kinematics) where the efficiency is reasonably large and constant, and/or to bin in as many dimensions as is feasible.",

One example is the proton kinematics in the CC0\u03c0 T2K analysis. No attempt is made to compute the cross-section as a function of proton kinematics but for backward going muons the presence of a reconstructed forward proton is needed to select the event. For the T2K analysis, the explicit model dependence of the efficiency was studied, using three neutrino interaction generators (NEUT v5.1.4.2, GENIE v2.8.3, and NuWro v11o). Each were simulated with the full detector response to check for areas in which the primary generator might be biasing the result (see Fig.2 top). The difference between the Monte Carlo calculations are non-negligible and this must be covered in the analysis by large signal modeling systematics (Fig. 5 of Ref. [19]), which are especially important in regions where the efficiency is low (high angle and low momentum). In the T2K analysis, the influence is small because for a low momentum backward muon the presence of a forward proton can be simulated by energy conservation in the approximation of small nuclear recoil.  Fig. 3 shows the efficiency of the T2K CC0\u03c0 selection overlaid with the generator predictions of interest for the workshop. The data is compared with efficiency based on NEUT 5.1.4.2, the cross section of NEUT 5.1.4.2, and additional modern generator models (NEUT 5.3.6, GENIE 2.12.0alt, and GiBUU). We note that NuWro is not included because it is almost identical to NEUT 5.3.6. The efficiency for Q 2 < 0.3 GeV in Fig.2 is changing rapidly due to difficulties in reconstruction. If T2K had produced a measurement unfolded in Q 2 , this would lead to unacceptable variations in results using different generators. In contrast, measurement of the cross-section as a function of muon kinematics is more robust against model variations. Provided that the efficiency is flat in a given p \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b8 \u00b5 bin, the efficiency will be largely independent of the model used in the analysis. In the larger picture, the fast variation of efficiency as a function of Q 2 makes the extraction of modelindependent physics difficult. For example, the fraction of 2p2h/1p1h population in the measured cross-section depends strongly on the Q 2 distribution of 2p2h and 1p1h processes which have their own model dependence. Such a measurement must then be compared to models only through a full detector simulation (as T2K has done with Fig.2).",

While GENIE and NEUT were easily usable, nuance was hard to resurrect. As a result, only shape results for nuance QE were available. One notable difference is the values of M QE A used, which affects the Q 2 distribution through the quasielastic form factor. While GENIE uses the value obtained from fits to deuterium bubble chambers (close to 1.0 GeV), NEUT uses a value of 1.21 GeV based on fits to K2K data, and broadly consistent with fits to modern heavy target data when nuclear effects are neglected. NUANCE uses the value extracted from a shape-only fit, i.e., 1.23 GeV. In recent years, inflated axial mass values have been replaced by proper models for 2p2h processes as an explanation of the apparent excess in data. This shift was in progress during MiniBooNE and MINERvA analysis and none were available in the generators at the time of the analyses discussed. Additionally, pion absorption is treated differently in each program, which modifies the contribution from CC1\u03c0 events that migrate into CC0\u03c0 samples.",

            "text": "Codes have undergone significant change in the last few years due to the efforts of nuclear theorists to adapt models used for electron scattering to neutrino interactions and efforts by the generator authors to include them. The nuclear model was changed from relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) to local Fermi gas (LFG) or Spectral Function (SF). Nucleon-nucleon correlations of short, medium (2p2h) or long (RPA) range are now known to be important, and at low neutrino energies Coulomb effects can also be important. Fig. 9 shows the MiniBooNE CC0\u03c0 Q 2 QE data with both old and new generator models. The range of cross section prediction was large for the older models because of different attempts to match the MiniBooNE data. However, recent models use theoretical models which were motivated by or tuned to this data, so unsurprisingly, there is less variation between them. In Fig. 10, the same comparison is made for the MINERvA CCQE-like data. It is important to note that the data shown here have been updated to include the improved NuMI flux calculations first presented in fall, 2015 [10]. This increases each data point by about 15%. As a result, agreement of recent generator versions with both MiniBooNE and MINERvA data sets has improved significantly. This is consistent with the findings of a theoretical group [92].",

GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro all use the Valencia model [45] and GiBUU has a separate version. GENIE 2.12.0alt further adopts the Nieves CCQE model [43] and is therefore about 10% less than the MiniBooNE data, same as was shown for the Valencia theoretical calculation. Figs. 6, 7, 11,and 12 show the muon differential cross sections. These have less model dependence and provide more detail. For MiniBooNE, the GiBUU calculation is in good agreement with both angular bins shown. Recent T2K data adds to our knowledge. Figs. 11 and 12 shows the muon momentum spectrum for two different angular ranges. The NuWro v11q results are close to the NEUT results, as expected due to sharing of generator models. In general, newer models are in better agreement with T2K data than older models, and forward angular bins are described less well than those with larger angles. The most forward angle T2K data is at very low Q 2 . It is interesting that the newer calculations tend to agree with the data in shape. In magnitude, the event generators are lower than GiBUU and GiBUU has the best agreement with all data sets. The most interesting feature is that GENIE, NEUT and NuWro disagree with the data by constant factors that would be approximately constant for each code.",

However, pions are much more likely than muons to hadronically interact in the detector. The MiniBooNE CC1\u03c0 + reconstruction took advantage of this and looked for events with kinked tracks, signifying a change in the particle direction coming from hadronic scattering, i.e. elastic or inelastic scattering. The fitter searched for events with three tracks: one from the upstream muon, one from the upstream pion, and one from the downstream (re-scattered) pion. The reconstruction simultaneously fit the kinked track (\u03c0 candidate) and straight track (\u00b5 candidate). The downstream pion candidate ring was required to have less energy than the upstream pion candidate ring. Additionally, three separate events in time were required for the CC1\u03c0 + candidate: the first sub-event from the muon and pion discussed above; the second and third coming from decay (\"Michel\") electrons from the stopped muon and pion. Overall, the pion energy reconstruction performs best in the region 75 < T \u03c0 < 150 MeV. Although the pion energy reconstruction performs best at low energies, the opposite is true for the angular reconstruction. Below 70 MeV, Cherenkov-emitting pions propagate less than 10 cm in MiniBooNE, which is insufficient to provide a track direction. 16% of the generated NUANCE events containing pions populate this low-momentum space, compared to only 1% of generated muons. The efficiency shape at higher T \u00b5 primarily comes from the containment criteria for the muon: higher energy muons will not stop in the MiniBooNE detector so will not be selected. This is a very similar case to the MiniBooNE CC0\u03c0 case.",

            "text": "Pion production analyses are complicated by the addition of a second track of a particle with a mean free path less than the nuclear size. This complicates acceptance because topology and kinematics are significantly altered, and possible confusion of pions and muons must be considered. Each experimental technology has different issues. It is interesting to note that the primary background for the MINERvA measurement was pion production events above W = 1.4 GeV feeding down into the signal region. The primary problem in MiniBooNE was the difficulty in reconstructing low momentum particles and confusion between pions and muons at the highest energies. For T2K, momentum reconstruction is much better than in MiniBooNE or MINERvA because of the TPC; however the pion-muon separation is difficult. By using MINOS to detect muons, MINERvA was able to avoid these issues. We construct several 2-D distributions of the selected MC sample for the most relevant observables. These distributions include the efficiency (with respect to true variables) and the purity of CC1\u03c0 + events (with respect to reconstructed variables). Fig. 13 shows two T \u03c0 vs. cos(\u03b8 \u03c0 ) plots at different stages of the cut application for the MINERvA 1\u03c0 measurement. T \u03c0 and \u03b8 \u03c0 were the primary observables of the measurement [24,25]. Since the sample used is Monte Carlo, some data based backgrounds are not included. The left side of Fig. 13 is the result after the W exp < 1.4 GeV cut, giving a smooth dependence on these variables. The result after application of E \u03bd , tracking and pion dE/dx cuts is shown in the right side of Fig. 13. The main effect is a significantly lower efficiency at about 90 \u2022 due to scintillator geometry, giving potential for model dependence. Unlike the QE case, where we found that selection choices and/or acceptance sculpted the physics (Fig. 8), the 1\u03c0 case showed that the efficiency was fairly flat for both MINERvA and T2K across Q 2 and W . However, we note that both selections ended up with appreciable efficiency for certain physics regions. Figure 14 (MINERvA) and Figure 15 (T2K) show efficiency and purity for T \u03c0 and cos(\u03b8 \u03c0 ) after all cuts. The overall low efficiency is due to the cutoffs in \u03b8 \u00b5 (see above). For MINERvA, difficulties in reconstruction of pions that interact in the scintillator detector are significantly suppressed by requiring a Michel electron. The inability to track particles at angles close to 90 \u2022 in MINERvA is seen in the very small efficiency there. Although MINERvA has larger purity overall because of the Michel electron requirement, T2K has larger kinematic coverage. While we were unable to obtain directly the simulation used for the MiniBooNE analysis to prepare efficiency overlays, efficiency plots from Ref. [93] are shown in Fig. 16. The main feature is the more uniform dependence on these variables due to the large size and isotropic acceptance of the MiniBooNE detector. Nevertheless, reconstruction of long tracks at large pion energies are a problem. Fig. 17 shows the MINERvA T \u03c0 and cos(\u03b8 \u03c0 ) results from various Monte Carlo calculations used by the experiments overlaid with the efficiency; Fig. 18 shows the same samples for physics variables Q 2 and W . Like the QE case, we see regions of low efficiency due to the response of the detector. For example, the MINERvA efficiency falls off rapidly below 50 MeV due to difficulties reconstructing short tracks as previously discussed. The analysis cut off the T \u03c0 distribution when the efficiency went below 1% and used a wide bin in \u03b8 \u03c0 to guarantee some acceptance. Of course, estimated errors for these data points are very large. The model dependence of \u03b8 \u00b5 was tested by executing parallel analyses where the signal was all angles and only angles less than 20 \u2022 . The results differ by roughly 25% in magnitude with a moderate change in shape; the agreement with generator predictions is very similar for the two analyses [24].",

MINERvA studied this issue [24,25] by doing parallel analyses with signal definitions using maximum W of 1.4 and 1.8 GeV. The wider definition is much less sensitive to migration across the boundary because the cross section is much flatter at the boundary. The T \u03c0 and \u03b8 \u03c0 data show moderate change between the two signal definitions and the generator (GENIE v2.6.3) is able to account for them [24]. These data have low statistics and newer high statistics \u00b1 measurement: efficiency (left) and purity (right) for events after all cuts as a function of \u03c0 kinetic energy and cos(\u03b8 \u03c0 ) in lab frame.

This decreases the number of events in the final sample due to smearing of signal events above the cut. This gives approximately a 10% reduction in the cross section. Coupled with the 15% increase in renormalization (also seen for the quasielastic data), there is a net 5% increase in the cross section with little shape change. The results for the MiniBooNE and MINERvA 1\u03c0 data comparison with event generator simulations are seen in Figs. 19 and 20, respectively. The large normalization discrepancy reported in the first MINERvA publication [24] has decreased a small amount. In addition, the new models have generally increased the cross sections, more for MINERvA than for MiniBooNE.

Although the signal definition specifies both \u03c0 \u00b1 , the MINERvA selection uses a decay electron (Michel) tag, which preferentially selects \u03c0 + . When the unfolding process is done, these events must come from Monte Carlo predictions and this adds to the model dependence. Although the rate of CC1\u03c0 \u2212 is low for W < 1.4 GeV, calculations need to include this component.

In particular, the 1D projections of a given particle (e.g. pion) momentum depend on the assumed pion angular distribution and whether or not the muon was also selected. The systematic uncertainties assigned to the 1\u03c0 signal model are believed to be incomplete because we observe data disagreements with most models.

To give one example, coherent pion production measurements were historically difficult at low energies because of high backgrounds and are now commonplace. At the same time, the challenge of making cross section measurements with broad spectrum beams has become evident, e.g. the difficulties in establishing a clean CCQE signal.

MiniBooNE also made a cut on W to avoid confusion between \u00b5 and \u03c0 identification, but introduced model dependence by correcting for higher W with a calculation. The choice of MINERvA to present results for two different W cuts is important, but brings in sensitivity to new physics effects in addition to examining the cut.",

Again, this is a derived quantity which brings in model dependence, perhaps unnecessarily. MINERvA is now abandoning the E \u03bd restriction [94].

If the correlation between the pion and muon states is incorrectly modeled, then this can bias the extracted cross section. In general, the detector efficiency is inferred from a model specific angular and momentum distribution. Existing methods for producing systematic errors cover some of this dependence.

For example, the MINERvA data was published with v2.6.2 and v2.12.10 is now available.
