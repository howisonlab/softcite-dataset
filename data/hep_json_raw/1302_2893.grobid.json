For this reason, the mixing of neutral mesons is generally considered a powerful probe to discover physics beyond the standard model. Meson-antimeson mixing has been observed in the K 0 \u2212K 0 [1], B 0 \u2212B 0 [2] and B 0 s \u2212B 0 s [3] systems, all with rates in agreement with standard model expectations. Evidence of mixing in the charm system has been reported by three experiments using different D 0 decay channels [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Only the combination of these measurements provides confirmation of D 0 \u2212 D 0 mixing with more than 5\u03c3 significance [10]. While it is accepted that charm mixing occurs, a clear observation of the phenomenon from a single measurement is needed to establish it conclusively.",

The value of f RS B (t) is constrained, within uncertainties, to the measured value, obtained by fitting the \u03c7 2 (IP) distribution of the RS D 0 candidates in bins of decay time (see figure 2).

This background is suppressed by the use of tight particle identification and two-body mass requirements. From studies of the events in the D 0 mass sidebands, we find that the dominant source of peaking background leaking into our signal region is from RS \u03c4 / t events which are doubly misidentified as a WS candidate; they are estimated to constitute (0.4 \u00b1 0.2)% of the WS signal. From the same events, we also derive a bound on the possible time dependence of this background (see figure 4), which is included in the fit in a similar manner to the secondary background. Contamination from peaking background due to partially reconstructed D 0 decays is found to be much smaller than 0.1% of the WS signal and neglected in the fit. Figure 5 shows the observed decay-time evolution of the WS to RS ratio, with the projection of the best fit result overlaid (solid line).
