Arguments based on unitarity, analyticity, and factorization imply an upper bound on the high-energy behaviour of total hadronic cross sections that prevents them from rising more rapidly than ln 2 (s) [4,5,6]. The rise of the total and inelastic cross section in the energy range of the LHC is further confirmed by two new measurements from the ATLAS collaboration. At the highest centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV a first measurement of the inelastic cross section is performed [7] and at 8 TeV the total cross section is determined [8].",

            "text": "The measurement of the inelastic yield is based on the counting of hits in the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillator (MBTS), which is a plastic scintillator located in front of the end-cap calorimeters at a distance of 3.6 m from the interaction point in the forward region (2.07 < |\u03b7| < 3.86). The counters are sensitive to diffractive dissociation processes with masses of the diffractive system M X > 13 GeV, or equivalently, \u03be = M 2 X /s > 10 \u22126 . Thus the inelastic cross section is primarily reported inside this fiducial volume corresponding to \u03be > 10 \u22126 , and then extrapolated to full phase space with the help of models for the total inelastic cross section. Data were collected in a special run at low luminosity and low pile-up in which an integrated luminosity of about 60 \u00b5b \u22121 was accumulated. In order to select inelastic events nominally two hits in the MBTS are requested in any of the counters, additionally a singlediffraction enhanced sample is selected by requiring two counters with hits on the same side with a veto at the other side. The ratio of the number of events with a single-side tag and the number of inclusive events, R SS , is used to constrain in the simulation the relative contributions of single-and double-diffraction (\u03c3 SD + \u03c3 DD ) to the inelastic cross section, f D = (\u03c3 SD + \u03c3 DD )/\u03c3 inel , using a procedure developed in Ref. [9]. The resulting predictions for the MBTS hit distribution from different models, all tuned to reproduce the measured value R SS = 10.4 \u00b1 0.4%, are shown in Fig. 1. The fiducial cross section is determined by  of events with \u03be < 10 \u22126 into the fiducial region, and L is the integrated luminosity of the sample. The measured fiducial cross section is determined to be \u03c3 fid inel = 68.1 \u00b1 0.6 (exp.) \u00b1 1.3 (lum.) mb. The extrapolation to \u03c3 inel uses constraints from previous ATLAS measurements to minimize the model dependence of the component that falls outside the fiducial region. \u03c3 inel can be written as",

Further cuts are imposed on the acollinearity of the events in order to reject background. The residual background contamination is determined from the data and subtracted. The resulting sample consisting about 3.8 M events. For each event the t-value is calculated according to \u2212t = \u03b8 \u00d7 p 2 , where p represents the nominal beam momentum and the scattering angle is calculated from the proton trajectories and beam optics parameters. The t-spectrum is unfolded for detector resolution and beam divergence effects and corrected for acceptance losses. The acceptance and unfolding corrections are calculated from a simulation tuned to account for the measured beam emittance and detector resolution [8]. The rate of elastic events is further corrected for reconstruction inefficiencies occurring in events developing hadronic showers according to a data-driven procedure [8].
