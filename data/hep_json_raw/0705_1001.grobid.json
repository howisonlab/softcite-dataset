            "text": "Charmless hadronic B decays are an important probe of the standard model (SM). They can be used to test the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism of flavor mixing and CP violation, with sensitivity to the three angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 of the Unitarity Triangle for B decays. Charmless processes are usually dominated by b \u2192 u tree amplitudes and \"penguin\" decays mediated by b \u2192 s and b \u2192 d processes involving a virtual loop with the emission of a gluon. These transitions are suppressed by CKM factors in the SM, with branching fractions at the 10 \u22126 \u2212 10 \u22125 level. Contributions from supersymmetric particles or other physical effects beyond the SM could induce observable deviations from SM predictions in the measured branching fractions and CP asymmetries. 1 In these proceedings, I summarize the most recent measurements for this class of decays at the BABAR experiment at SLAC. The results include two-body, three-body, and quasi-two-body decay modes. We also report measurements of polarization in modes with two vector mesons in the final state, which are also a sensitive test of SM predictions and the effect of potential non-SM contributions.",

Other amplitudes from SM and non-SM processes could alter this expectation. The prediction has been verified in the tree-dominated B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 and B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c9 decays, with measured f L in the range 0.8 \u2212 1.0. BABAR reports branching-fraction, charge-asymmetry, and polarization measurements in the B \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 and B \u2192 \u03c1K * decays, 8 which are thought to be dominated by b \u2192 s penguin amplitudes. The results are summarized in Table 3. The observed longitudinal-polarization fractions are approximately f L \u223c 0.5 for the vector-vector modes, while the measured transversepolarization fractions are f \u22a5 (B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * (892) 0 ) = 0.227 \u00b1 0.038 \u00b1 0.013 and f \u22a5 (B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 2 (1430) 0 = 0.045 +0.049 \u22120.040 \u00b1 0.013, implying the amplitude hierarchy |A 0 | \u2248 |A +1 | \u226b |A \u22121 |. This suggests the presence of additional contributions to the total amplitude of these decays. 7 These can come from SM sources, such as annihilation amplitudes, electromagnetic or charming penguins, and long-distance rescattering effects; or from non-SM sources such as right-handed supersymmetric mass insertions or tensor Z \u2032\u2032 . Whatever their source, the additional contributions are not interfering with the nominal amplitudes to produce sizeable CP asymmetries, as the measurements are consistent with the SM prediction of zero or very small CP violation. Thus, they must occupy a peculiar corner of phase space. It is Table 3. Branching fractions, CP asymmetries, and fractions of longitudinal polarization in vector-vector and vector-tensor modes.
