            "text": "The B \u00fe c meson, the ground state of the \" bc system, is unique, being the only weakly decaying heavy quarkonium system. Its lifetime [1,2] is almost 3 times smaller than that of other beauty mesons, pointing to the important role of the charm quark in weak B \u00fe c decays. The B \u00fe c meson was first observed through its semileptonic decay B \u00fe c ! J=c ' \u00fe ' X [3]. Only three hadronic modes have been observed so far: B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe [4], B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 [5] and B \u00fe c ! c \u00f02S\u00de \u00fe [6]. The first observations of the decays B \u00fe c ! J=c D \u00fe s and B \u00fe c ! J=c D \u00c3\u00fe s are reported in this paper. The leading Feynman diagrams of these decays are shown in Fig. 1. The decay B \u00fe c ! J=c D \u00fe s is expected to proceed mainly through spectator and color-suppressed spectator diagrams. In contrast to decays of other beauty hadrons, the weak annihilation topology is not suppressed and can contribute significantly to the decay amplitude.",

The candidates should be consistent with being produced in a pp interaction vertex by requiring 2 IP < 9 with respect to reconstructed pp collision vertices. A kinematic fit is applied to the B \u00fe c candidates [27]. To improve the mass and lifetime resolution, in this fit, a constraint on the pointing of the candidate to the primary vertex is applied together with mass constraints on the intermediate J=c and D \u00fe s states. The value of the J=c mass is taken from Ref. [1]. For the D \u00fe s meson the value of m D \u00fe s \u00bc 1968:31 AE 0:20 MeV=c 2 is used, that is, the average of the values given in Refs. [1,28].
