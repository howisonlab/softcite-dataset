In this scheme, the axion-photon conversion power has been formulated to be valid for certain conditions, either Q cavity \u226a Q axion or Q cavity \u226b Q axion . This remedy, however, fails when these two quantities are comparable to each other. Furthermore, the noise power flow has been treated independently of the impedance mismatch of the system, which could give rise to misleading estimates of the experimental sensitivity. We revisit the analytical approaches to derive a general description of the signal and noise power. We also optimize the coupling strength of a receiver to yield the maximal sensitivity for axion search experiments.",

With some constraints on mass, the hypothetical particle possesses a cosomological implication which can account for dark matter in our galactic halo [2]. A large fraction of the mass range is accessible using the cavity haloscope technique where the axion field is resonantly converted into a microwave field in the presence of an external magnetic field [3]. This detection scheme provides one of the most sensitive approaches to the well established theoretical models [4,5]. \u2021 These authors contributed equally to this work. \u00a7 Corresponding author.",

This formula gives rise to the optimal coupling strength \u03b2 = 2, which is typically chosen by many experiments to maximize sensitivity. Current experiments [9][10][11] [12] have presumed so far that the last parameter in Eqs. 1 and 4 always equals to Q c and Q l since the typical cavity quality factors of Q c \u2248 10 4 \u223c 10 5 are much smaller than the axion quality factor of Q a \u2248 10 6 [13]. However, the recent developments in superconducting (SC) technology and its applications to radio-frequency science are likely to dramatically increase the quality factor of resonant cavities even under strong magnetic fields [14]. Furthermore, the system noise power in Eq. 3 has been assumed to be transmitted intact to the receiver regardless of impedance mismatch. It is of importance to address that the noise power transmission is also subject to the receiver coupling in a similar manner to the signal power. Here, we revisit the axion electrodynamics to derive a generic expression of the signal power, and consider a circuit diagram of an axion cavity haloscope to reformulate the system noise. We also obtain the general form of the scanning rate and examine its dependency on the coupling strength to maximize experimental sensitivity.",

These two noise temperatures linearly contribute to the total system noise temperature, such that T sys = T phy + T add . When estimating noise, it has been assumed so far that the thermal noise generated in the cavity is propagated to the receiver in its entirety without being subject to impedance mismatch between the two RF systems. This may be because receiver chains are typically designed such that a circulator with one port terminated by a matched load at the end, which is equivalently an isolator, is placed between the cavity and the preamplifier. The matched load appears to the amplifier regardless of the cavity-receiver coupling [18] and thus the loaded noise power on the amplifier is always the same as the generated one, P phy = k B T phy \u2206\u03bd. However, here we count the impedance mismatch in, to derive a general description of noise propagation. In addition, with advanced cryogenic technologies, very low temperatures are achievable and thus quantum effects must be taken into account. According to Ref. [8], the noise fluctuation at temperature T phy for a given impedance Z(\u03c9) of a system is",

An experimental demonstration was performed to verify the \u03b2 dependence of noise power transfer, as in Eq. 16, using a cylindrical copper cavity. The cavity dimension provides a TM 010 resonant frequency of 5.9 GHz and a cavity quality factor of 15,000 at room temperature. The TM 010 mode is mostly chosen by experiments since it yields the maximum form factor for solenoids. A monopole antenna is introduced on top of the cavity to pick up the power generated by the cavity thermal noise at room temperature. The received noise power is amplified by a high-electron-mobility transistor before being delivered to a spectrum analyzer via a coaxial cable. Based on the Y-factor method using a noise source with an excess-noise-ratio (ENR) of 15 dB, the total gain and noise temperature of the detector chain were measured to be 36.7 \u00b1 0.3 dB and 75.2 \u00b1 3.1 K, respectively. The power spectra from the cavity were acquired for various values of the coupling \u03b2, as measured by a network analyzer. Different values of \u03b2 were obtained by varying the insertion length of the antenna into the cavity. We also considered additional RF components, such as an isolator and a directional coupler, between the antenna and amplifier to examine their effects. The resolution bandwidth of 10 kHz was chosen because it was small enough, compared with the cavity width, to resolve signals, while also being large enough to achieve a reasonably fast acquisition time. Figure 5 displays the noise power at the resonant frequency with various couplings for the different components. The data points are fitted using a function of \u03b2 with the same form as in Eq. 17, i.e., f (\u03b2) = A \u2022 \u03b2/(1 + \u03b2) 2 + B, where A and B are the fitting parameters associated with T eff and T add , respectively. R-squared was chosen as a statistical measure of the goodness of fit. It is noticed that the fitting function describes the data reasonably well and small deviations from unity of the R-squared values imply the validity of the fit. The estimated noise power distribution, assuming a total gain of 36.7 dB and noise temperature of 75.2 K at room temperature, is seen to be consistent with the measurement with no component. The noise factor of the RF devices (here the amplifier) is known to have a dependence on the source impedance mismatch [21], and its effect is also taken into consideration by comparing the noise power with the input port terminated with open, short, and matched loads. The error band accounts for both the statistical uncertainties in the gain (0.3 dB) and noise temperature (3.1 K), and the systematic uncertainties from the inaccuracy of the ENR value (0.2 dB) and the noise factor dependence on source impedance (< 4.6 K).",

The maximum power appears when the impedance is matched (\u03b2 = 1) regardless of the type of added component and the corresponding values are comparable with each other.
