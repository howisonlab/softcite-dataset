Identifying hadronically decaying tau leptons with good performance is an essential part of these analyses. We present the current status of the tau reconstruction and identification at the LHC with the ATLAS detector.

            "text": "Tau leptons are important signatures for Standard Model processes and searches for new physics. With a mass of 1.777 GeV, the tau is the heaviest lepton and due to its short lifetime of 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u221213 s (c\u03c4 = 87\u00b5m), the tau lepton decays inside the beam pipe of the LHC [1]. The tau lepton is the only lepton that has a hadronic decay mode. While it decays in 35% of the time leptonically, the hadronic decay mode occurs 65% of the time. The majority of hadronic tau decays are characterized by one or three charged pions usually accompanied by neutral pions. The kinematics of QCD jets are similar to that of hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons, leading to a high potential probability for misidentifying them as tau leptons. In addition, the crosssection of most of the Standard Model and new physics processes with tau leptons in the final state are small compared to the overwhelming background from QCD processes at LHC. Therefore well performing tau identification is crucial. In ATLAS [2], tau reconstruction and identification [3] concentrates on the hadronic decay modes of a tau lepton. They are classified according to the number of reconstructed charged decay particles (prongs). These decays can be differentiated from QCD jets by their characteristics, such as low track multiplicity, collimated energy deposits, and in case of 3-prong tau leptons the displacement of the secondary vertex.",

The number of tracks within \u2206R < 0.2 is used to classify the tau candidate into single-or multi-prong categories.

Calibration factors are derived from response functions using Monte Carlo simulations, which come from the ratio of reconstructed tau energy to true visible tau energy. Response functions are functions dependent on the tau transverse momentum p T , and calculated separately for single-and multi-prong tau leptons, as well as for different detector regions. The systematic uncertainties on the tau energy scale are fully derived from Monte Carlo and were found to be 4%-7% [3].",

            "text": "Since there is no attempt to separate QCD jets and tau leptons in the reconstruction process a dedicated identification step is needed. It is based on variables which provide discrimination power between QCD jets and tau leptons. While the charged tracks from the \u03c4 lepton decay are collimated in a narrow cone, tracks from QCD jets are distributed more widely (Figure 1). The energy deposit in the calorimeter is also collimated in a small area around the tau axis, while for QCD jets, a larger area is affected (Figure 2). There are three independent methods for tau identification in ATLAS: a cut-based approach, placing rectangular cuts on variables, a projective likelihood (LLH)  method, using the log-likelihood-ratio of signal and background, and boosted decision trees (BDT), to find the optimal separation in a multi-dimensional phase space. The methods use different sets of identification variables and are separately trained for single-and multi-prong tau candidates. In addition, the likelihood and BDT are trained for different numbers of reconstructed vertices in order to take event pile-up into account. Three dedicated working points with signal efficiencies of \u223c 60%, \u223c 45% and \u223c 30% (loose, medium, tight) are provided for all tau identification methods. The likelihood output score is shown in Figure 3) for 3-prong tau candidates. For the training of the identification algorithms, the QCD background was obtained from data, while the tau decay signal was simulated in W \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd and Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 Monte Carlo samples. The inverse background efficiency [3] versus signal efficiency for all three methods is shown for 1-prong (Figure 4) low-p T and 3-prong ( Figure 5) high-p T tau candidates.",

Events are tagged with a muon from a tau decay, and the other tau lepton in the event is required to decay hadronically, forming the probe that is used to measure the identification efficiency.
