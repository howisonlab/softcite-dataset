Based on previous conventional Partial-Wave Analyses (PWA), we performed a \"freed-isobar PWA\" on the same data, removing model assumptions on the dynamic isobar amplitudes for dominating waves. In this analysis, we encountered continuous mathematical ambiguities, which we were able to identify and resolve. This analysis gives an unprecedented insight in the interplay of 2\u03c0 and 3\u03c0 dynamics in the process. As an example we show results for a spin-exotic wave J PC X \u2212 = 1 \u2212+ wave.",
