The measurement is performed using the \u03d2(nS) \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay mode, with data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 32.6 nb \u22121 . Differential cross sections as functions of the \u03d2(nS) transverse momentum squared p 2 T , and rapidity y, are presented. The \u03d2(1S) photoproduction cross section is extracted in the rapidity range |y| < 2.2, which corresponds to photon-proton centre-ofmass energies in the range 91 < W \u03b3 p < 826 GeV. The data are compared to theoretical predictions based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and to previous measurements.",

            "text": "This paper reports a first measurement of the exclusive photoproduction of \u03d2 mesons from protons in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, performed at the CERN LHC with the CMS detector. Exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons can be studied at the LHC in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of protons and/or ions occurring at impact parameters larger than the sum of their radii, thereby largely suppressing their hadronic interaction [1]. In such UPCs, one of the incoming hadrons emits a quasi-real photon that converts into a qq (vector meson) bound state following a colour-singlet gluon exchange with the other \"target\" proton or ion [2,3]. Since the incoming hadrons remain intact after the interaction and only the vector meson is produced in the event, the process is called \"exclusive\". Given that the photon flux scales with the square of the emitting electric charge, the radiation of quasi-real photons from the Pb ion is strongly enhanced compared to that from the proton. Figure 1a shows the dominant diagram for the exclusive \u03d2 photoproduction signal in pPb collisions, pPb \u2192 (\u03b3 p)Pb \u2192 p \u03d2 Pb. If the \u03d2 photoproduce-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch tion is followed by the proton breakup, the process is called \"semiexclusive\" (Fig. 1b). The exchanged photon can also interact with a photon radiated from the proton [1,4]. This two-photon collision can produce an exclusive dimuon state, as shown in Fig. 1c. Since we are interested in studying exclusive \u03d2 production via its dimuon decay, the latter quantum electrodynamics (QED) continuum production constitutes a background process.",

            "text": "The study of exclusive photoproduction of quarkonia offers a clean probe of the target hadron structure [1,3,5], with the large mass of the J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 mesons providing a hard scale for calculations based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [6][7][8][9]. In the kinematic region studied here, the photoproduction of J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 mesons from protons is sensitive to generalized parton distributions (GPDs), which can be approximated by the square of the gluon density in the proton [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. Experimentally, exclusive J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 photoproduction cross sections have been observed to rise with photon-proton centre-of-mass energy W \u03b3 p , following a power-law dependence W \u03b4 \u03b3 p with \u03b4 = 0.7-1.2 [20,21]. This reflects the steep rise of the underlying gluon density in the proton for decreasing values of the momentum fraction x of the proton carried by the struck parton. The dependence of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction cross section on the squared four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex t, parameterized at low values of |t| with an exponential function of the form exp(\u2212b|t|) [20,[22][23][24], has also often been studied; the b slope parameter provides valuable information on the parton transverse density profile of the proton [7,8,25].",

            "text": "Exclusive \u03d2 meson photoproduction was first observed in electron-proton collisions at HERA [20][21][22]24] with the quasi-real photon radiated from the electron. At the CERN LHC, the LHCb [26][27][28], CMS [29], and ALICE [30][31][32][33] experiments have measured exclusive photoproduction of J/\u03c8 mesons in ultraperipheral proton-proton and nuclear collisions. The LHCb experiment has also reported the measurement of the exclusive \u03d2 photoproduction cross section in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [34]. The larger mass of the \u03d2 meson provides a larger perturbative scale at which the gluon distribution in the proton is sampled, and thereby reduces theoretical uncertainties in pQCD calculations. This allows the data to constrain the gluon distributions at low values of Bjorken x in global PDF fits for the first time [35]. The present paper reports the measurement of \u03d2 photoproduction in pPb UPCs that probes the gluon density of the proton in the region x = m 2 \u03d2 /W 2 \u03b3 p = 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 [3], where m \u03d2 is the \u03d2 meson mass. This CMS measurement spans a previously unexplored low-x region between the HERA and LHCb data, and provides additional experimental insights on the gluon content in the proton. In this low-x regime, nonlinear QCD effects (gluon recombination) may become important, possibly leading to the saturation of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) [36][37][38].",

These include differential cross sections as functions of the \u03d2 rapidity and transverse momentum squared p 2 T (which approximates the absolute value of the fourmomentum transfer squared at the proton vertex, |t|), as well as the total \u03d2(1S) cross section as a function of W \u03b3 p .

The starlight MC assumes that the photon flux from the incoming hadron(s) is described by the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams equivalent photon approximation [46,47], and uses an empirical fit of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction cross sections to the existing HERA \u03b3 p data. In the \u03d2(nS) sample, two contributions are simulated, with the photon being emitted either from the Pb ion or from the proton. The \u03b3 p events where the photon is emitted from the Pb ion constitute the signal, while the small fraction of \u03b3 Pb events with the photon emitted from the proton is treated as a background. The signal events in the starlight MC are simulated assuming a |t|-differential cross section following an exp(\u2212b|t|) dependence, and a power law dependence of the cross section on the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy, W \u03b4 \u03b3 p , with the exponent \u03b4. In this study, the b and \u03b4 parameters are tuned to reproduce the data through a reweighting procedure described in Sect. 4. The backgrounds from inclusive and semiexclusive \u03d2 and dimuon production processes are obtained using templates derived from control samples in the data, as explained in the next section. All simulated events are passed through the Geant4-based [48][49][50] detector simulation and the event reconstruction chain of CMS.",

The UPC dimuon events are selected at the trigger level with a dedicated HLT algorithm, requiring at least one muon and at least one, but not more than six, tracks in the event. At the offline level, additional selection criteria for muon quality requirements, are applied [40,51]. In order to minimize the uncertainties related to the lowp T muon reconstruction inefficiencies, muons with p \u03bc T > 3.3 GeV are selected in the region |\u03b7 \u03bc | < 2.2 in the laboratory frame. Exclusive events are selected by requiring two opposite-charge muons with a single vertex and no extra charged particles with p T > 0.1 GeV associated with it. In addition, no energy deposits in the HF calorimeters are allowed. This is achieved by requiring that the largest HF tower energy deposit be smaller than 5 GeV. The HF energy threshold is set to be larger than the detector noise, and is determined from the energy distributions collected in dedicated data taking with no LHC beams. Furthermore, the rapidity of the muon pair is required to be in the region |y| < 2.2 in the laboratory frame. Only events with the p T of the muon pair between 0.1 and 1 GeV are considered, thereby reducing the contamination from QED pairs at very low p T and from \u03d2 meson production in inclusive and semiexclusive (where the proton dissociates into a low-mass hadronic system, Fig. 1b) processes that dominate the region of large dimuon p T > 1 GeV. Figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution of \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pairs in the range between 8 and 12 GeV that satisfy the selection criteria described above.

The six free parameters of the fit are the normalizations of the background and the three signal peaks, as well as the mass and the width of the \u03d2(1S) resonance. The \u03d2(2S) \u2212 \u03d2(1S) and \u03d2(3S) \u2212 \u03d2(1S) mass differences are fixed to their PDG values [53], while the widths of \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) are expressed in terms of the \u03d2(1S) width scaled by the ratio of their masses. The parameters describing the background plus the \u03d2(1S) and \u03d2(2S) resonances do not change if the \u03d2(3S) signal is neglected in the fit. The statistical significance of the \u03d2(1S) + \u03d2(2S) peaks over the background is 3.9\u03c3 . The apparent excess at 8.5 GeV has a local significance of 1.6\u03c3 , and is consistent with a statistical fluctuation. Because of the overall small number of events in the data sample, a determination of the separate \u03d2(nS) differential cross sections by fitting the invariant mass spectrum in each p 2 T and y bin leads to results with large statistical fluctuations. Instead, the cross sections are extracted by adding up the events, after background subtraction, in the 9.1-10.6 GeV mass region corresponding to the three \u03d2 states combined, and the \u03d2(1S) yield is derived from the \u03d2(1S)/\u03d2(sum) ratio, where \u03d2(sum) = \u03d2(1S) + \u03d2(2S) + \u03d2(3S), as described in Sect. 5. Figure 3 shows the dimuon p 2 T and rapidity distributions in the invariant mass interval 9.1 < m \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 < 10.6 GeV for events passing all the selection criteria for the combined pPb and Pbp samples. The data, uncorrected for detector effects, are compared to the starlight simulation for exclusive \u03d2(nS) and QED dimuon production, normalized to the recorded integrated luminosity, together with the inclusive and semiexclusive backgrounds derived from the data themselves as discussed below. The simulated \u03d2(nS) events from starlight are shown separately for the \u03b3 p and \u03b3 Pb processes; the latter (with much smaller cross sections) are considered as a background in this analysis. The \u03d2(nS) events generated with starlight are reweighted to describe the data, using the parameters b = 5.8 GeV \u22122 for the |t| distribution slope, and \u03b4 = 0.99 for the cross section energy dependence. These parameters minimize the \u03c7 2 goodnessof-fit value calculated using the data and MC distributions of Fig. 3. The minimization is performed as a function of the rapidity simultaneously for the \u03b3 p and \u03b3 Pb samples, and as a function of p 2 T for the \u03b3 p events. For \u03b3 Pb events, the default starlight p T spectrum is used.",

These background contributions are estimated from the data, by removing selectively the neutral or charged exclusivity requirements. A template dominated by semiexclusive contributions is constructed using events with only two muon tracks in the tracker accompanied by at least one HF tower having an energy deposit larger than the noise threshold of 5 GeV, in the direction of the outgoing proton. Events with two muons satisfying the selection criteria, but with at least one additional track with p T > 0.1 GeV, are used to build a template dominated by inclusive DY production events. The normalizations of the two templates are obtained from a fit to the measured p 2 T distribution extended up to p 2 T = 10 GeV 2 , where proton dissociation and inclusive events dominate, as seen in the tail of the distribution of Fig. 3a. The combination of the normalized inclusive and semiexclusive templates describes the region of high dimuon p 2 T well in the data in all four y bins used for the cross section extraction. The overall fraction of both backgrounds in the signal sample is estimated to be 11% (3 and 48% in the lowest and highest dimuon p 2 T bin, respectively). As an extra cross check of the nonexclusive background subtraction, the signal extraction is repeated by requiring in addition no neutron detection in the ZDC calorimeters [29].

All these uncertainties affect only the \u03d2(1S) cross sections. -The theoretical uncertainty in the photon flux affects only the total cross section \u03c3 \u03b3 p\u2192\u03d2(1S)p and is estimated by changing the Pb radius by \u00b1 0.5 fm, conservatively covering different estimates of the neutron skin thickness [60]. It amounts to 2, 3, 3, and 9% in the four y bins, respectively. The photon flux uncertainty (listed in the bottom row of Table 3) is larger for higher photon energies as they are dominated by smaller impact parameters. -A systematic normalization uncertainty of \u00b1 4% associated with the integrated luminosity [61] is assigned to the measurement of differential and total cross sections, with no effect on the b slope uncertainty.",

A fit with the power-law function in the entire W \u03b3 p range of the data yields \u03b4 = 1.39 and \u03b4 = 0.84 for the LO and NLO calculations, respectively. The LO predictions show a steeper increase of the cross section with energy than seen in the data over the full kinematic range. The NLO prediction reproduces the measured rise of the cross section with W \u03b3 p . The recent LHCb results at higher W \u03b3 p [34] also disfavour the JMRT LO prediction. Figure 6 shows theoretical predictions from the fIPsat, IIM, and bCGC models, which overall bracket the combined HERA and LHC results. The fIPsat calculations are consistent with the CMS measurement, but predict a somewhat higher cross section than that measured by LHCb. The IIM and bCGC predictions satisfactorily describe the rise of the cross section with \u03b3 p centre-of-mass energy. As discussed in Ref. [10], the gluon PDF associated with the JMRT NLO prediction, which is consistent with the CMS+LHCb data presented here, has a somewhat different shape at low-x than that predicted by standard pQCD collinear fits used at the LHC such as CT14 [66], NNPDF3.0 [67], and MMHT [68]. However, given the currently large statistical uncertainty of the results presented here, an improved understanding of the low-x gluon density, and its evolution with energy scale, will require more precise measurements with larger integrated luminosities and/or at higher centre-of-mass energies.",

The differential cross section d\u03c3/d p 2 T and associated exponential slope b have been measured in the squared transverse momentum range p 2 T < 1.0 GeV 2 . The extracted value of b = 6.0 \u00b1 2.1 (stat) \u00b1 0.3 (syst) GeV \u22122 is consistent with the slope measurement at other centre-of-mass energies. The exclusive \u03d2(1S) photoproduction cross sections, differential in rapidity y and as a function of the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy W \u03b3 p , have been measured in the range 91 < W \u03b3 p < 826 GeV. Such measurements probe the region of parton fractional momenta x \u2248 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 in the proton, bridging a previously unexplored region between the HERA and LHCb measurements. The dependence of \u03c3 \u03b3 p\u2192\u03d2(1S)p on W \u03b3 p is well described by a power law with an exponent smaller than that predicted by leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) approaches. The exponent is, however, consistent with that extracted from a fit to the HERA and LHCb data, and with that predicted by nextto-leading-order pQCD calculations. The data, within their currently large statistical uncertainties, are consistent with various pQCD approaches that model the behaviour of the low-x gluon density, and provide new insights on the gluon distribution in the proton in this poorly explored region. thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
