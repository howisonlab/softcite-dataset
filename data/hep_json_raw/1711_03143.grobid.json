The data were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb \u22121 . The measurement is performed by analyzing events with at least one charged lepton. The measured cross section is \u03c3 tt = 69.5 \u00b1 6.1 (stat) \u00b1 5.6 (syst) \u00b1 1.6 (lumi) pb, with a total relative uncertainty of 12%. The result is in agreement with the expectation from the standard model. The impact of the presented measurement on the determination of the gluon distribution function is investigated.",

The pair production (tt) cross section (\u03c3 tt ) as a function of center-of-mass energy can be of interest for the extraction of the top quark pole mass [1] and has been used to constrain the gluon distribution function [2] at large fractions x of the proton longitudinal momentum carried by the gluon, where the gluon distribution is poorly known. Precise measurements of \u03c3 tt in proton-proton (pp) collisions have been published at \u221a s values of 7 and 8 [3][4][5][6] and 13 TeV [7][8][9][10] by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC.",

It is around 73% at 5.02 TeV, as calculated with powheg (v2) [11][12][13] at next-to-leading order (NLO) JHEP03 (2018)115using the NNPDF3.0 NLO [14] parton distribution functions (PDFs), and increases to around 86% at 13 TeV, making this new data set partially complementary to the higherenergy samples. Measurements of tt production at various \u221a s probe different values of x and thus can provide complementary information on the gluon distribution. In addition, future measurements of \u03c3 tt in nuclear collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-ofmass energy [15,16] would profit from the availability of a reference measurement in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV, without the need to extrapolate from measurements at different \u221a s. This has already been demonstrated with the first observation of the tt process using proton-nucleus collisions at a higher nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy [17].",

The tt events are categorized according to the decay of the two W bosons. In tt events where one W boson decays leptonically and the other hadronically ( +jets channel), the final state presents a typical signature of one isolated lepton, missing transverse momentum, two jets from the W boson hadronic decay, and two jets coming from the hadronization of the b quarks (\"b jets\"). On the other hand, in tt events where both W bosons decay leptonically (dilepton channel), the final state contains two leptons of opposite electric charge, missing transverse momentum, and at least two b jets. The +jets channel has a large branching ratio with a moderate amount of background, while the dilepton channel is characterized by a high purity.",

In the former case, \u03c3 tt is extracted by a fit to the distribution of a kinematic variable for different categories of lepton flavor and jet multiplicity, while in the latter an event counting approach is used. The two results are then combined in the final measurement, which is used as input to a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) analysis at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) to investigate the impact on the determination of the gluon distribution in the less-explored kinematic range of x 0.1. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the CMS detector. Section 3 gives a summary of the data and simulated samples used. After the discussion of the object reconstruction in section 4, and of the trigger and event selection in section 5, section 6 describes the determination of the background sources. The systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 7. The extraction of \u03c3 tt is presented in section 8 and the impact of the presented measurement on the determination of the proton PDFs is discussed in section 9.

For electron and muon candidates, a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, is constructed around the direction of the lepton track at the primary event vertex, where \u2206R is defined as \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 , and \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle between the directions of the lepton and another particle. A relative isolation discriminant, I rel , is calculated by the ratio between the scalar p T sum of all particle candidates inside the cone consistent with originating from the primary vertex and the p T of the lepton candidate. In this sum, we exclude the p T of the lepton candidate. The neutral particle contribution to I rel is corrected for energy deposits from pileup interactions using different techniques for electrons and muons. For muons, half of the total p T of the charged hadron PF candidates not originating from the primary vertex is subtracted. The factor of one half accounts for the different fraction of charged and neutral particles in the cone. For electrons, the FastJet technique [43] is used, in which the median of the energy-density distribution of neutral particles (within the area of any jet in the event) multiplied by the geometric area of the isolation cone -scaled by a factor that accounts for the residual \u03b7-dependence of the average energy deposition due to pileup -is subtracted.",

The uncertainty in the Z/\u03b3 * estimation is calculated by combining in quadrature the statistical uncertainty and an additional 30% from the variation of the scale factor in the different levels of selection, resulting in uncertainties of about 30 and 80% in the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 and \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channels, respectively. The systematic uncertainty in the non-W/Z background is estimated to be 90% in the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channel and is dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the method. Owing to the limited sample size in the data, the method cannot be applied in the \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channel. The estimation is therefore based on MC simulation, and an uncertainty of 100% is conservatively assigned.",

Two variables were independently considered for the fit, which are sensitive to the resonant behavior of the light jets produced from the W boson hadronic decay in a tt event. Given that these light jets, here denoted by j and j , are correlated during production, they are also expected to be closer in phase space when compared to pairs of other jets in the event. The angular distance \u2206R can thus be used as a metric to rank all pairs of non-btagged jets in the event, maximizing the probability of selecting those from the W boson hadronic decay in cases where more than two non-b-tagged jets are found. From simulation we expect that the signal peaks at low \u2206R, while the background is uniformly distributed up to \u2206R \u2248 3. Above that value, fewer events are expected and background processes are predicted to dominate. The invariant mass M (j, j ) of jets j and j also has a distinctive peaking feature for the signal in contrast with a smooth background continuum. From simulation we expect that the minimum angular distance \u2206R between all pairs of jets j and j , \u2206R min (j, j ), is robust against signal modeling uncertainties such as the choice of the \u00b5 R , \u00b5 F scales and jet energy scale and resolution, while the M (j, j ) variable tends to be more affected by such uncertainties. Owing to its more robust systematic uncertainties and signal-to-background discrimination power, the \u2206R min (j, j ) variable is used to extract the tt cross section.",

The latter data set is used in order to improve the constraint on the light-quark distributions. Version 2.0.0 of xFitter [59,60], the open-source QCD-analysis framework for PDF determination, is employed, with the partons evolved using the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi equations [61][62][63][64][65][66] at NNLO, as implemented in the qcdnum 17-01/13 program [67]. The treatment and the choices for the central values and variations of the c and b quark masses, the strong coupling, and the strange-quark content fraction of the proton follow that of earlier CMS analyses, e.g., ref.

Inclusive \u03c3 tt in pp collisions as a function of the center-of-mass energy; previous CMS measurements at \u221a s = 7, 8[5,6], and 13[9,10] TeV in the separate +jets and dilepton channels are displayed, along with the combined measurement at 5.02 TeV from this analysis. The NNLO+NNLL theoretical prediction[34] using the NNPDF3.0[14] PDF set with \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.118 and m top = 172.5 GeV is shown in the main plot. In the inset, additional predictions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV using the MMHT14[54], CT14[55], and ABMP16[56] PDF sets, the latter with \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.115 and m top = 170.4 GeV, are compared, along with the NNPDF3.0 prediction, to the individual and combined results from this analysis. The vertical bars and bands represent the total uncertainties in the data and in the predictions, respectively.",
