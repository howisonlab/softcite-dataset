In a large variety of models the LSP is the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ). Naturalness considerations [13,14] suggest that the supersymmetric partners of the thirdgeneration SM quarks are the lightest coloured supersymmetric particles. This may lead to the lightest bottom squark (b 1 ) and top squark (t 1 ) mass eigenstates 1 being significantly lighter than the other squarks and the gluinos. As a consequence,b 1 andt 1 could be pair-produced with relatively large cross-sections at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",

The dataset analysed corresponds to 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collisions data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment during Run 2 of the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The third-generation squarks are assumed to decay to the lightest neutralino (LSP) directly or through one intermediate stage. The search is based on simplified models inspired by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [15][16][17], where th\u1ebd b 1 exclusively decays asb 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 0 1 or where two decay modes for the bottom (top) squark are allowed and direct decays to the LSP,b 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 0 1 (t 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 ) compete with decays via an intermediate chargino (\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) state,b 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 \u00b1 1 (t 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ). In this case it is assumed that th\u1ebd \u03c7 \u00b1 1 is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) and is almost degenerate with \u03c7 0 1 , such that other decay products are too low in momentum to be efficiently reconstructed. The first set of models lead to final-state events from bottom squark pair production characterized by the presence of two b-jets, E miss T and no charged leptons ( = e, \u00b5), referred to as the zero-lepton channel (figure 1a). For mixed decays models (intended as models where both direct decays and decays through an intermediate stage are kinematically allowed), the final state of bottom or top squark pair production depends on the branching ratios of the competing decay modes. If the decay modes are equally probable, a large fraction of the signal events are characterized by the presence of a top quark, a bottom quark, and neutralinos. Hadronic decays of the top quark are targeted by the zero-lepton channel, whilst novel dedicated selections requiring one charged lepton, two b-jets and E miss T are developed for semi-leptonic decays of the top quark, referred to as the one-lepton channel (figure 1b). A statistical combination of the two channels is performed when interpreting the results in terms of exclusion limits on the third-generation squark masses.",

The positive x-axis is defined by the direction from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, with the positive y-axis pointing upwards, while the beam direction defines the z-axis. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity \u03b7 is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 by \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Rapidity is defined as y = 0.5 ln[(E + pz)/(E \u2212 pz)] where E denotes the energy and pz is the component of the momentum along the beam direction. inner tracking detector consists of pixel and silicon microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5, surrounded by a transition radiation tracker which enhances electron identification in the region |\u03b7| < 2.0. Between Run 1 and Run 2, a new inner pixel layer, the insertable B-layer [22], was added at a mean sensor radius of 3.3 cm. The inner detector is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing an axial 2 T magnetic field and by a fine-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage in the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) of the hadronic calorimeter are made of LAr active layers with either copper or tungsten as the absorber material. An extensive muon spectrometer with an air-core toroidal magnet system surrounds the calorimeters. Three layers of high-precision tracking chambers provide coverage in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, while dedicated fast chambers allow triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4.

The matrix element (ME) calculation was performed at tree level and includes the emission of up to two additional partons. The ME-PS matching was done using the CKKW-L [32] prescription, with a matching scale set to one quarter of the thirdgeneration squark mass. The NNPDF23LO [33] parton distribution function (PDF) set was used. The cross-sections used to evaluate the signal yields are calculated to next-toleading-order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [34][35][36]. The nominal cross-section and uncertainty are taken as the midpoint and half-width of an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in ref. [37]. SM background samples were simulated using different MC event generator programs depending on the process. The generation of tt was performed by the Powheg-Box [38] v2 generator with the CT10 [39] PDF set for the matrix element calculations. Singletop-quark events in the W t, s-, and t\u2212 channels were generated using the Powheg-Box v1 generator. For all processes involving top quarks, top quark spin correlations were preserved. The parton shower, fragmentation and the underlying event were simulated using Pythia v6.428 [40] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the Perugia 2012 [41] tune for the underlying event. The h damp parameter in Powheg, which controls the p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born level and thus regulates the p T of the recoil emission against the tt system, was set to the mass of the top quark (m t = 172.5 GeV). All events with at least one leptonically decaying W boson are retained. Fully hadronic tt and singletop events do not contain sufficient E miss T to contribute significantly to the background. The tt samples are normalized using their next-to-NLO (NNLO) cross-section including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-NLL accuracy using Top++2.0 [42]. Samples of single-top-quark events are normalized using the NLO cross-sections reported in refs. [43][44][45] for the s-, t-and W t-channels, respectively.",

The reconstructed jets are then calibrated to the particle level by the application of a jet energy scale (JES) derived from \u221a s = 13 TeV data and simulation [59]. Quality criteria are imposed to identify jets arising from non-collision sources or detector noise, and any event containing such a jet is removed [60]. Further track-based selections are applied to reject jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 that originate from pile-up interactions [61], and the jet momentum is corrected by subtracting the expected average energy contribution from pile-up using the jet area method [62]. Jets are classified as \"baseline\" and \"signal\". Baseline jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.8. Signal jets, selected after resolving overlaps with electrons and muons, are required to pass the stricter requirement of p T > 35 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8.",

Events containing one or more muon candidates that have a transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex larger than 0.2 mm (1 mm) are rejected to suppress muons from cosmic rays. Muon candidates are also required to satisfy \"medium\" quality criteria [68] and have |\u03b7| \u00a1 2.5. All electron and muon candidates must have p T > 10 GeV. Lepton candidates remaining after resolving overlaps with baseline jets (see next paragraph) are called \"baseline\" leptons. In the control and signal regions where lepton identification is required, \"signal\" leptons are chosen from the baseline set with p T > 27 GeV to ensure full efficiency of the trigger and are required to be isolated from other activity in the detector using a criterion designed to accept at least 95% of leptons from Z boson decays as detailed in ref. [69]. The angular separation between the lepton and the b-jet arising from a semi-leptonically decaying top quark narrows as the top quark's p T increases.

They are constrained by Gaussian distributions with widths corresponding to the sizes of the uncertainties and are treated as correlated, when appropriate, between the various regions. The product of the various probability density functions forms the likelihood, which the fit maximizes by adjusting the background normalization and the nuisance parameters. Finally, the reliability of the MC extrapolation of the SM background estimate outside of the control regions is evaluated in several validation regions (VRs).",

The first method exploits the similarity of the Z+jets and \u03b3+jets processes [79]. For a photon with p T significantly larger than the mass of the Z boson, the kinematics of \u03b3+jets events strongly resemble those of Z+jets events. A set of dedicated control regions is defined by requiring one isolated photon with p T > 145 GeV. The p T of the photon is vectorially added to the p miss T , and the magnitude of this sum is used to replace the E miss Tbased selections. The yields are then propagated to the SRs using a reweighting factor derived using the MC simulation. This factor takes into account the different kinematics of the two processes and residual effects arising from the different geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency for photons. In the second alternative method, applied to b0L-SRA only, the MC simulation is used to verify that the shape of the m CT distribution for events with no b-tagged jets is compatible with the shape of the m CT distribution for events where two b-tagged jets are present. A new highly populated Z+jets CR is defined, selecting Z \u2192 events with no b-tagged jets. The m CT distribution in this CR is constructed using the two leading jets and is used to estimate the shape of the m CT distribution in the b0L-SRA, whilst the normalization in SRA is rescaled based on the ratio in data of Z \u2192 events with no b-tagged jets to events with two b-tagged jets. Additional MC-based corrections are applied to take into account the two-lepton selection in this CR.

Two control regions (b1L-CRttA and b1L-CRttB) where the tt production is enhanced are defined by inverting the am T2 selection. In the case of b1L-CRttA the m bb selection is also inverted, while for b1L-CRttB the min[m T (b-jet, E miss T )] requirement is inverted. To allow a statistical combination of the results from the b0L-SRA and b1L-SRA regions the corresponding tt CRs are defined to be orthogonal via the m CT selection. The single-top-quark contribution is estimated with the same CR employed by the b0L analysis. In the case of b1L-SRB the production of W +jets is no longer negligible, and is estimated by using a dedicated control region b1L-CRwB, where only one b-tagged jet is required. In total, two CRs are used to estimate the event yields in b1L-SRA and three CRs to estimate the yields in b1L-SRB. The yields in all these CRs are also shown in figure 3 and compared to the direct MC prediction before the likelihood fit is performed. The normalization parameters reported for each SR and SM background process include the statistical and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The decrease of the \u00b5 tt parameter from SRA to SRC is related to mismodelling in the description of tt processes by Powheg +Pythia 6 MC samples. Previous analyses [80] also found normalization factors considerably smaller than unity for tt background processes in similar regions of phase space. The W +jets and Z+jets normalization factors are larger than unity.

Predictions from an inclusive W W bb sample generated at LO using MadGraph5 aMC@NLO are compared with the sum of the tt and W t predictions, and differences from the nominal predictions are taken as systematic uncertainties.",

Experimental uncertainties are found to be between 15% and 30% across theb 1 -\u03c7 0 1 mass plane for exclusiveb 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 0 1 decays and between 10% and 25% for models where bottom squarks decay with a significant branching ratio asb 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , assuming the one-lepton channel selection. In all SRs, they are largely dominated by the uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency. Theoretical uncertainties in the NLO+NLL cross-section are calculated for each SUSY signal scenario and are dominated by the uncertainties in the renormalization and factorization scales, followed by the uncertainty in the PDF. They vary between 15% and 25% for bottom squark masses in the range between 400 GeV and 1100 GeV. Additional uncertainties in the acceptance and efficiency due to the modelling of initial-state radiation and scale variations in SUSY signal MC samples are also taken into account and contribute up to about 10%. Tables 8 and 9 report the observed number of events and the SM prediction after the background-only fit for each signal region in the zero-lepton and one-lepton channels, respectively. The background-only fit results are compared to the pre-fit predictions based on MC simulation. The largest background contribution in b0L-SRs arises from Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd produced in association with b-quarks followed by W +jets production, whilst top quark and W +jets production dominates SM predictions for b1L-SRs. The results are also summarized in figure 5, where the pulls for each of the SRs are also presented. No significant excess above the expected Standard Model background yield is observed, although b1L-SRA300-2j presents a discrepancy between data and SM predictions of about 1.5\u03c3. Figure 6 shows the comparison between the observed data and the SM predictions for some relevant kinematic distributions for the b0L and b1L selections. For illustrative purposes, the distributions expected for scenarios with different bottom squark and neutralino masses depending on the SR considered are shown.",
