            "text": "On the other hand, it is not obvious that the mass scale of such new particles is anywhere near the energy which can be reached by current, or even future, accelerators. However, in contrast to the direct production of heavy particles, their impact on observables accessible at current collider experiments can be probed indirectly in the context of effective field theories. Such theories extend the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian by terms allowed in quantum field theory and which share the gauge symmetries of the SM. These terms contain one or several effective operators and corresponding coefficients, often referred to as Wilson coefficients, which de-fine the individual strength of these operators. Depending on the type of operator, the additional terms in the Lagrangian can have an impact on different observables, which, in turn, can be compared to a set of corresponding measurements. Comparisons of SM predictions and observations can be used to constrain the Wilson coefficients by propagation of uncertainty. The strategy to indirectly infer on the parameters of a physics model, may it be an effective model or a full model, has proven to be successful in a variety of applications, e.g. in the field of flavor physics [1], super-symmetry [2], or electroweak precision measurements [3]. This paper describes a generic tool, the EFTfitter, for performing such interpretations in the context of user-defined physics models and formulating them in terms of Bayesian reasoning. Emphasis is placed on the statistical treatment of the combination of measurements correlated by their uncertainties as well as on often overlooked issues in interpretations, such as the necessity to consider model-specific efficiency and acceptance corrections for the measurements, or the presence of physical constraints on observables and parameters. An example is given for the case of an effective field theory in the top-quark sector, which is an active field of research. This example is motivated by the wealth of experimental data delivered by the Tevatron and LHC experiments and the increasing precision of measurements involving top quarks. Also from a theoretical perspective, the interpretation of top-quark measurements is attractive: recent calculations, e.g. predictions of the cross section of top-quark pair production [4,5,6], reach next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) precision in perturbative QCD. A historical example for the interpretation of experimental data in the context of top quarks is the successful prediction of the top-quark mass from electroweak precision measurements, see, e.g., Ref. [7]. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the statistical procedure of combining several measurements, while their interpretation is discussed in Section 3. The numerical implementation of the EFTfitter is introduced in Section 4, and an example for interpretations in the field of top-quark physics is given in Section 5. The paper is concluded in Section 6.",

These couplings and masses are often not predicted by the models themselves, in which case they are free parameters. Couplings, e.g., can often only be estimated indirectly from the measurements of cross sections and other observables. This case will be discussed further in Section 3.

It is worth noting that combined estimates of physical quantities based on individual posterior probabilities need to be cleaned from the corresponding prior probabilities, i.e. the prior information about a parameter should only be included once in the overall combination.

If no reliable estimate of the correlation is possible, one can associate correlation coefficients with nuisance parameters \u03bd and choose suitable prior probabilities for these parameters. Necessary requirements for the priors are that the correlation coefficients are constrained to be in the interval [\u22121, +1], and that the covariance matrix remains positive-semidefinite for all possible values of \u03bd. They should, however, parameterise the prior knowledge about the correlation, e.g. by restricting the correlation coefficients to be positive or by favouring mild correlations. Depending on the problem, it can be difficult to formulate such priors analytically. In particular, it is advisable to not allow values resulting in correlation coefficients of \u03c1 = \u00b11 for the entries of the total covariance matrix as those might lead to numerical instabilities. Prior probabilities for covariance matrices are proposed in the literature, see e.g. Refs. [12,13,14].

These imply that the function f can be linearised in y and that the posterior probability for the quantity of interest also has a Gaussian shape. Since this is not always the case, and since the posterior of the combination does not have to be a Gaussian due to the additional prior information, we instead propose to use a numerical evaluation of the uncertainty: if it is possible to sample from the posterior distribution p(y|x), one can calculate the target quantity f (y) for each sampled point. The obtained frequency distribution for f converges to the posterior probability distribution p(f |x) in the large sample limit.

Although counter-intuitive at first sight, these weights can also take negative values, induced by strong negative correlations, see e.g. the discussion in Refs. [9,10]. There are several ways to estimate the impact of individual measurements in a combination. For the approach discussed here, we propose to repeat the combination while removing one measurement from the combination at a time. The measurements can then be ranked according to the resulting increase in uncertainty compared to the uncertainty of the overall combination. For combinations with two (n) physical quantities, the area (volume) of the smallest contour (hypersphere) covering, e.g., 68.3% of the posterior probability, can be used as a rank indicator.

If the model predicts observables y i for each set of parameter values \u03bb, y i = y i (\u03bb), these are then compared to the measurements x i using a multivariate Gaussian model.

As an example, Fig. 1 shows the predicted fraction of left-handed W -bosons as a function of any of the couplings in the range [\u22121, +1], while keeping the other three couplings fixed to their SM values. While the variation of V R and g L results in variations of f L from about 15% to a maximum of roughly 30% at V R = 0 and g L = 0, g R has a stronger impact. The value of f L ranges from 0% to about 70% with a minimum at approximately g R = 0.5. As expected, there is no dependence of the helicity fractions on V L .

We assume that there is no correlation between the helicity and cross-section measurements. This simplifying assumption is made because the measurements are performed by two different experiments and because the event selections for the two measurements are orthogonal. Common sources of systematic uncertainty, e.g. from LHC machine settings or the modelling of top quarks in Monte Carlo generators, could lead to a small correlation, however. Furthermore, we assume that the correlation between the measurements of top-and antitop-quark cross sections is mild, but not negligible, and we thus choose \u03c1(\u03c3 t , \u03c3t) = +0.50. Although the event selections are again orthogonalthe leptons selected differ by the sign of their electric charge-common sources of systematic uncertainty have a similar impact on both measurement, e.g. uncertainties on the jet-energy and lepton-momentum scales or the Monte Carlo generator uncertainties.

            "text": "We have presented a tool for interpreting measurements in the context of effective field theories. This EFTfitter allows implementing a user-defined model, either directly or via interfaces to other software tools, including predictions of observables based on the free parameters of the model. Measurements of these observables are then combined and used to constrain the free parameters. A variety of features of the EFTfitter helps to quantify and visualise the results. An example in the field of top-quark physics was shown, for which anomalous couplings of the W tb-vertex were constrained based on measurements of the W -boson helicity fractions and the single-top t-channel cross sections.",
