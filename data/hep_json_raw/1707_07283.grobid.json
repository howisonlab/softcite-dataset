While the observation serves as a powerful affirmation of the SM mechanism for generating particle masses, the discovery does not rule out the existence of a more complex theory with an extended Higgs sector. The discovery of additional scalar or pseudoscalar bosons may be evidence of such a scenario.",

One well studied scenario is the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) [5,6] predicting the existence of additional elementary Higgs particles. The 2HDM includes a CP-odd Higgs boson, A, that could be light and produced in association with bottom quarks at the LHC. In some schemes, with a negatively-signed Yukawa coupling to the down-type fermions, the associated bbA production cross section times branching fraction into muons can be very large for an A boson with a mass below about 60 GeV, i.e. less than half of the mass of the observed SM-like Higgs boson [7]. It can vary from 1000 to 35 fb for A boson masses in the range from 25 to 60 GeV at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV in proton-proton collisions.",

A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the tracking volume. It is comprised of a barrel region |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| = 3. A lead and silicon-strip preshower detector is located in front of the ECAL endcaps. A brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter surrounds the ECAL and also covers the region |\u03b7| < 3. Steel forward calorimeters with quartz fibers, read out by photomultipliers, extend the calorimetric coverage up to |\u03b7| = 5. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction.",

Also the algorithms have a different approach to the calibration of the constituents: cluster calibration from simulation in the case of the PF algorithm; and corrections due to calorimeter thresholds and tracking inefficiency in the case of the JPT algorithm. These jet reconstruction algorithms are affected differently by detector effects, like tracker misalignment or the calibration of the calorimeter, and thus serve as an important cross-check of each other.

The threshold on the leading muon p \u00b5 1 T is fixed to 25 GeV. This choice is determined by the single-muon trigger p T threshold of 24 GeV. The rapidity requirements on the muons and b jets are driven by the trigger and particle identification conditions. The optimization procedure selects the thresholds on the subleading p T muon (p \u00b5 2 T ), the leading b jet p T (p b jet T ), and p miss T , where an approximate estimate of signal significance, defined as Z = 2( \u221a S + B \u2212 \u221a B) [48] reaches its maximal value. The p miss T requirement is used to suppress the tt background. The presence of a second jet (b tagged or not) is not required since in the bbA production process the second b jet is often at high \u03b7 or has too low p T .",

The scale uncertainty in the \u00b5\u00b5bb prediction, taken from simulation, has been evaluated as a function of the dimuon mass using the pp \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5bb process implemented in MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.3.0 in a four-flavor production scheme with massive b quarks [52]. The renormalization and factorization scales (\u00b5 R and \u00b5 F ) have been varied simultaneously by factors of 0.5 and 2.0. The uncertainty on the differential cross-section as a function of the dimuon mass varies from 20 to 15% in the dimuon mass region of 12 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 70 GeV. It is applied to the total DY+jets background, motivated by the fact the DY plus light-flavor jets background after the b tagging requirement is much smaller than the \u00b5\u00b5bb background, and the scale uncertainty for the \u00b5\u00b5cc process is expected to be similar to that for the \u00b5\u00b5bb process.",

The uncertainty in the gluon-gluon luminosity is considered, since in the four-flavor scheme the dominant LO production process is gg \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5bb. The qq \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5bb process represents only 15% of the total cross-section. The gluon-gluon luminosity uncertainty is compared for three PDF sets, CT10NLO [53], MSTW2008NLO [54], and NNPDF2.3NLO [55]. In the mass region of 30-70 GeV the CT10NLO uncertainty envelope covers the uncertainties of the other two PDF sets, therefore the CT10NLO gluon-gluon luminosity uncertainty is used in the analysis. This PDF uncertainty is applied as a function of the dimuon mass to the total DY+jets background after b tagging has been applied. It is motivated by the fact that the \u00b5\u00b5cc and \u00b5\u00b5bb processes are both initiated by gluon-gluon interactions in the four-flavor scheme at LO.",

The histogram labeled as MC(Top) shows the sum of the single top and top quark pair production processes.The upper limits on the signal contribution in the mass range of 25 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 60 GeV have been extracted using a fit of the binned background and signal templates to the dimuon mass distribution in the region 12 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 70 GeV. The mass intervals of[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] and[60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70] GeV have been used for a verification of the background expectation obtained from the simulation.The signal and background templates are obtained from simulation rescaled and corrected using information from data. To obtain signal mass shapes in 1 GeV steps we perform a linear interpolation between histograms as a function of the mass using the algorithm described in ref.[49] and implemented in the root package[50]. The W+jets and VV background event yields are found to be negligible. The predicted yields for the background processes take into account the following sources of systematic uncertainty, where the range of variations of each source was determined in dedicated studies with appropriate data control samples or, if relevant, from the theory uncertainty affecting the prediction:",
