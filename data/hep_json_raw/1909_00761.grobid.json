To cope with a fourfold increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2015 to 2018 (Run 2), to 2.1 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beamcrossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. For proton-proton collisions, the single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 GeV, and rises to 96% at 60 GeV; the trigger efficiency of a 25 GeV leg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of 30 GeV. For heavy-ion collisions, the primary electron and photon trigger efficiencies relative to the corresponding standard offline selections are at least 84% and 95%, respectively, at 5 GeV above the corresponding trigger threshold.",

The innermost part consists of a silicon pixel detector with four layers. The layer closest to the beam-pipe, the insertable B-layer, was installed before Run 2 and provides high-resolution hits in three-dimensions with pixels at a radius of 3.3 cm to improve the tracking performance. A silicon microstrip tracker surrounds the pixel detector with typically four layers of sensor modules. Each module is composed of multiple pairs of sensors with a stereo-angle to measure three-dimensional hit positions. The outermost region of the tracker in the range |\u03b7| < 2.0 is covered by a transition radiation tracker (TRT). It consists of straw drift tubes filled with a gas mixture of 70% Xe, 27% CO 2 and 3% O 2 interleaved with polypropylene/polyethylene transition radiators creating transition radiation for particles with a large Lorentz factor. This radiation is absorbed by the Xe-based gas mixture, discriminating electrons from hadrons over a wide energy range. Some of the TRT modules instead contain a gas mixture of 70% Ar, 28.5% CO 2 and 1.5% O 2 as a mitigation for gas leaks that cannot be repaired without an invasive opening of the inner detector. At the end of Run 2 data-taking the two innermost TRT barrel layers, i.e. about half of the modules in |\u03b7| < 0.6, and 3 (2) out of 14 endcap wheels in \u22122 < \u03b7 < \u22121 (1 < \u03b7 < 2) were running with the argonbased gas mixture. The presence of this gas mixture is taken into account in the simulation and the corresponding loss in identification power is partially mitigated by a dedicated TRT particle-identification algorithm [7]. For charged particles with transverse momenta > 0.5 GeV the TRT provides typically 35 hits per track.",

It is designed to provide a full \u03c6 coverage and covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9, with finer granularity over the region matched to the inner detector. The EM calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter with an accordion-geometry. It is divided into two half-barrels (\u22121.475 < \u03b7 < 0 and 0 < \u03b7 < 1.475) and two endcap components (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2).

Over the region devoted to precision measurements (|\u03b7| < 2.5, excluding the transition region), the EM calorimeter is segmented into three layers longitudinal in shower depth. The first layer consists of strips finely grained in the \u03b7 direction, offering excellent discrimination between isolated photons and pairs of closely spaced photons coming from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay. For electrons and photons with high transverse energy, most of the energy is collected in the second layer, which has a lateral granularity of 0.025 \u00d7 0.025 in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space. The third layer provides measurements of energy deposited in the tails of the shower.

It is interfaced to Pythia 8.186 [14] for the modelling of the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event (UE), with parameters set according to the AZNLO tune [15]. The CT10 PDF set [16] is used for the hard-scattering processes, whereas the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [17] is used for the parton shower. The effect of QED final-state radiation is simulated with Photos++ (v3.52) [18,19]. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [20] is used to decay bottom and charm hadrons. For optimisation of the low-E T electron selection, J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee samples are used. These were generated with Pythia 8.186, the A14 set of tuned parameters [21], and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set for both the hard-scattering processes and the parton shower.

Fake photon signatures can result either from non-prompt photons originating from the decay of neutral hadrons in jets, or from jets depositing a large energy fraction in the EM calorimeter. Two identification working points (WPs), 'loose' and 'tight', are defined for photons. Photon identification WPs are strictly inclusive, i.e. photons satisfying the 'tight' selection are a subset of those satisfying the 'loose' selection. The 'loose' selection is based on shower shapes in the second layer of the EM calorimeter and on the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter. In addition to the 'loose' selection criteria, the 'tight' selection uses information from the finely segmented first layer of the calorimeter. For a collection of photons radiated from leptons in Z decays and with E T >25 GeV, the efficiency integrated over 2015-2017 data sets of the 'loose' ('tight') selection is 98.9% (87.5%) for photons not matched to any track and 96.3% (87.6%) for photons matched to conversion vertices [31].",

The LH probability density functions (pdfs) for the E T range of 4.5 to 15 GeV are derived from J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee and for E T > 15 GeV from Z \u2192 ee events as described in Ref. [31]. Different pdfs are obtained for each identification quantity in separate bins in electron-candidate E T and \u03b7. To ensure a smooth variation of the electron identification efficiency with the electron E T , the discriminant requirements are varied in finer bins than those defined for the pdfs and, at the E T bin boundaries, a linear interpolation between the neighbouring bins in E T is used to determine both the pdf values and the discriminant requirements at the bin boundaries. This procedure is referred to as 'smoothing'. The discriminant threshold is also adjusted linearly as a function of the number of reconstructed vertices to yield a stable rejection of background electrons. Three operating points, corresponding to increasing threshold values for the LH discriminant, are defined (identification efficiencies quoted are averages for electroweak processes integrated over 2015-2017 data sets): 'loose' (93%), 'medium' (88%) and 'tight' (80%) [31].",

A sliding window algorithm is used, with a window consisting of 4 \u00d7 4 trigger towers with granularity 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 in \u03b7 and \u03c6, longitudinally segmented into electromagnetic and hadronic towers.

The offline reconstruction uses a looser, asymmetric condition for the matching in \u03c6 [31] to mitigate the effects of the energy loss due to bremsstrahlung; this leads to some inefficiency at the trigger level. In the precision step, the electron selection relies on a multivariate technique using a LH discriminant with four operating points: 'lhvloose', 'lhloose', 'lhmedium', and 'lhtight'. The identification in the trigger is designed to be as close as possible to the offline version, but there are a few necessary differences: the discriminating variables used online have different resolutions; the momentum loss due to bremsstrahlung, p/ p, is not accounted for in the online LH. Triggers with 'nod0' suffixed to their names do not include the transverse impact parameter relative to the beam-line, d 0 , and its significance, |d 0 /\u03c3 (d 0 )|, in the online LH: this reduces inefficiency due to the absence of the bremsstrahlung-aware re-fit in the HLT and preserves efficiency for electrons from exotic processes which do not originate at the primary vertex.",

A hundred rings are defined in total within an RoI. There are n = 8 rings for each of the presampler, second, and third layers of the EM calorimeter, 64 rings in the first layer of the EM calorimeter, and 4 rings in each of the three layers of the hadronic calorimeter.

Overall, the use of the Ringer algorithm enabled at least a 50% reduction in the CPU demand for the lowest-threshold unprescaled single-electron trigger. In Run 2, the Ringer algorithm was used only in the electron triggers with E T thresholds above 15 GeV, because of the availability of a large Z \u2192 ee event sample in data, useful for the Ringer algorithm validation. Its implementation for the electron triggers with E T thresholds below 15 GeV was finalized only during 2018, too late to be used for the data-taking.

One of the main characteristics of HI collisions is event centrality, which is determined by the total transverse energy measured in the forward calorimeter, FCal E T . Small (large) values correspond to events with a small (large) overlap region of two colliding nuclei. In a PbPb collision, the average background originating from the UE in the calorimeter and ID can affect the performance of the online reconstruction and identification of photons and electrons. Unlike pile-up in pp collisions, the UE background cannot be assumed to change slowly with time; on the contrary, it can be dramatically different event-by-event due to the varying HI collision centrality. The tracking performance is approximately centrality-independent, so the track-related requirements are identical to those for pp collisions.",

The cut-based electron identification for HI collisions is similar to that used for the pp data-taking in Run 1 (2010-2012) [1]. Two WPs are defined: 'loose_ion' and 'medium_ion', based on a subset of variables used in the standard electron LH selection. These working points are strictly inclusive. The 'medium_ion' working point uses more variables than 'loose_ion' to increase background rejection.  Table 4. Trigger level is L1 or HLT, often omitted for brevity. Possible object types are 'EM' for L1 EM cluster, 'g' for HLT photon and 'e' for HLT electron. Additional options at L1, detailed in Sect. 6.1, are \u03b7-dependence of the E T threshold (denoted by the letter 'V' appended to the trigger name), the hadronic activity veto (denoted by 'H') and the EM isolation requirement (denoted by 'I'). Although each HLT trigger is configured with a L1 trigger as its 'seed', the latter is not always mentioned explicitly as part of the trigger name. For example, a trigger with name 2g20_tight_icalovloose_L12EM15VHI is designed to identify at least two photons at the HLT with E T > 20 GeV each satisfying 'tight' photon identification criteria and calorimeter-only very loose isolation requirements; here the name explicitly mentions the 'seed' L1 trigger, which requires two isolated L1 EM clusters with \u03b7dependent threshold centred on E T of 15 GeV.",

Therefore, when presenting the results in Sect. 10, several efficiencies per trigger are provided and these correspond to a few representative offline electron selections. Events with Z \u2192 ee decays are collected using unprescaled single-electron triggers (see Sect. 10.1 for details).

For the electron trigger efficiency measurement, the isolation and identification requirements on the probe are always specified and they have to correspond to the electron offline identification requirements used in an analysis. The background subtraction is performed with so-called Z mass method [46], in which the invariantmass distribution constructed from the tag-probe pair is used to discriminate electrons from background.

The BS sample efficiency, BS , is computed on collision events recorded by a special 'random' trigger, which runs at a rate of a few Hz, by comparing the number of the BS events with the number of isolated, identified and reconstructed offline photon candidates in the sample. The background contamination in this sample is large, which could lead to biases towards a lower efficiency estimate. Those biases are expected to be small because the photon trigger efficiency is evaluated with respect to 'tight' and isolated offline photons and a few GeV above the trigger threshold. The trigger efficiency for background photons fulfilling the 'tight' offline identification is also very high, close to the one of signal photons; an additional systematic uncertainty is assigned as described below to account for any potential biases.",

            "text": "The statistical uncertainty associated with the Z radiative decay method is calculated as a confidence interval of a Bayesian estimate with Jeffrey's prior [48]. The systematic uncertainty is estimated by following the strategy used The photon trigger efficiency as a function of the offline photon E T for both legs of the primary diphoton trigger in the 2018 pp data. The measurement using the BS method (open markers) is compared with that using the Z radiative decay (filled markers) method. The efficiency is computed with respect to offline photons satisfying 'tight' identification criteria and a 'calorimeter-only tight' isolation requirement. Offline photon candidates in the calorimeter transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52 are not considered. The error bars indicate statistical uncertainties in the Z \u2192 ee tag-and-probe method for electron measurements described in Sect. 7.2. In this case, the two leptons are the tags, and the photon is the probe. The systematic uncertainty is estimated from variations in the trigger efficiency measurement resulting from changing the requirements on the leptons and on the dilepton and three-body systems. The requirement on the invariant mass of the dilepton system is varied from 30 < m < 83 GeV to 50 < m < 90 GeV. The three-body system mass requirement is varied from 65 < m \u03b3 < 105 GeV to 80 < m \u03b3 < 95 GeV. In addition, when considering the electron channel, the identification of the tags is changed from 'tight' to 'medium' for one or both electrons. Figure 4 shows a comparison between the BS and Z radiative decay methods for 'medium' photon triggers in 2018. The small difference in performance for the turn-on is due to the different purities of the samples: there are significant backgrounds in the BS sample, and almost inexistent backgrounds in the Z radiative decay measurement, leading to slightly higher efficiency computed by the Z radiative decay method. This is expected, as the efficiency for the trigger to select the background present in the BS sample is lower than the efficiency for the trigger to select real photons. Typically, physics analyses use the photon triggers to select objects with E T at least 5 GeV above the trigger threshold. In that regime, the efficiency measurements of both methods give compatible results. The Z radiative decay method provides a data-driven sample of photons with very high purity to compute the efficiency for trigger thresholds below 60 GeV; above this value the BS method is used.   Table 5 shows the lowest-threshold unprescaled single-object and diobject L1 EM triggers in the different data-taking periods during Run 2. Figure 5 shows the L1 rates for the singleobject and diobject EM calorimeter triggers during Run 2. Among the triggers shown there are two single-object triggers not used in Run 2: the L1_EM20VHI trigger, to highlight the additional rejection from the EM isolation requirement, and L1_EM24VHI, which was a 'backup' trigger for single EM objects. The single-object L1 rates in Fig. 5a are well described by a linear fit as a function of luminosity, with an approximately zero intercept, indicating a negligible contribution from effects not related to pp collisions, as expected for such a narrow RoI window. For single-object L1 EM triggers with E T in the range 20-24 GeV, the rate is reduced by approximately 25% when the threshold is raised by 2 GeV. For diobject L1 EM triggers this reduction in rate depends on the threshold: for a 5 GeV increase from L1_2EM10VH (L1_2EM15VH) a reduction of 90% (50%) is achieved. An additional EM isolation requirement (I) leads to a consistent rate reduction of about 44% per leg for single-object (L1_EM20VH) and diobject (L1_2EM15VH) triggers and a pile-up-dependent efficiency loss of at most 5% up to 50 GeV, as shown in Fig. 6. No isolation requirements are applied above this E T value.",

These searches require the trigger E T thresholds to be kept symmetric and as low as possible. Run 2 trigger thresholds allow searches to reach diphoton invariant masses down to \u223c 60 GeV. These triggers are constrained by both the L1 and HLT rates. The L1_2EM15VH threshold was used in 2015-2016 and L1_2EM15VHI, which includes EM isolation at L1, was used in 2017-2018. The HLT rate for these triggers was about 16 Hz as shown in Fig. 10. The HLT thresholds were kept at 20 GeV in 2015, and then were increased to 22 GeV as the peak luminosity rose above 1.2 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in 2016. The use of the topo-clusterbased calorimeter isolation in the HLT allowed the thresholds to be lowered back to 20 GeV for the 2017-2018 data-taking period, despite the higher instantaneous luminosity and more challenging pile-up conditions. Figure 11 shows the low-mass diphoton trigger efficiencies as a function of E T , \u03b7 and pile-up. The efficiency is   computed with the Z radiative decay method for a single photon trigger leg of the diphoton trigger with respect to offline photons satisfying the tight identification criteria and the calorimeter-only tight isolation requirement. Slightly lower efficiency is observed for 2017 triggers due to a different LHC bunch structure as well as loosening of the offline tight photon selection, which was applied online only for the 2018 data-taking period. Triggers in 2017-2018 also suffer from some inefficiency due to L1 isolation up to \u223c 50 GeV, as discussed in Sect. 8. The isolated trigger g20_tight_icalovloose_L1EM15VHI exhibits a degradation in efficiency of 4-5% when \u03bc rises from 20 to 60; this effect is visible in Fig. 11c. Above \u03bc \u223c 55, the trend to lower efficiency continues and the statistical uncertainty becomes large. The reoptimisation of the online tight identification selection criteria improved the efficiency of these triggers in 2018 relative to 2017 at \u03bc values above \u223c 40.",

These changes are not always reflected in the trigger names. For example, the Ringer algorithm (described in Sect. 6.3.1) was introduced in 2017. The additional background rejection allowed looser fast electron and precision calorimeter selections. In particular, for the latter step, in 2015-2016 there was a selection which relied on a multivariate technique using a LH discrim-  inant, constructed similarly to the standard offline precision selection one, but based only on calorimetric variables. This discriminant had \u223c 4% inefficiency relative to the offline selection. This inefficiency was removed in 2017-2018 by moving to a simpler requirement based only on E T . The 2015 and 2016 pdfs for the electron LH were derived from simulation samples described in Sect. 4. The pdfs for the trigger electrons with E T below (above) 15 GeV were determined with J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee (Z \u2192 ee) MC samples, and corrected for differences between data and simulation [41]. The 2017 pdfs for electrons and background above 15 GeV were derived from data as detailed in Ref. [31]; pdf 'smoothing' was also introduced online for all triggers. The 2018 electron data-driven pdfs for all working points except the 'medium' one were updated with 2017 data, maintaining the original selection criteria and optimising for higher pile-up conditions ( \u03bc up to 100). The 2018 pdfs for electrons with E T below 15 GeV were also derived from data as detailed in Ref. [31].",

This single-electron trigger ensures the collection of the majority of the events with leptonic W and Z boson decays, which are present in a wide range of measurements and searches in ATLAS. Although the threshold of this trigger is mainly constrained by the L1 bandwidth, as discussed in Sect. 8, the need for a low threshold and HLT rate places strong constraints on the tightness of the identification used by this trigger in the HLT. Relying on this trigger provides a simple and inclusive strategy, widely used in the ATLAS physics programme, at a cost of about 20% of the total L1 and HLT rate. Figure 14 shows the rates for the lowest-threshold unprescaled isolated single-electron triggers used during Run 2 as a function of the instantaneous luminosity. The LH selec- tion ('lhtight') of the lowest-threshold unprescaled isolated single-electron trigger is tuned for a given rate, which remained unchanged in 2016-2018. The electron trigger candidates originate from various processes, as shown in Fig. 15. This shows the lowest-threshold unprescaled isolated single-electron trigger rate as a function of the HLT electron E T -threshold value, broken down by process. The total rate is measured in a data set collected at a constant instantaneous luminosity of 8 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, while the individual contributions from W , Z and multijet production are estimated with MC simulation. The dominant uncertainty in the multijet rate is evaluated with a data-driven technique: the rate as a function of E T is obtained in a multijet-enriched region by inverting the HLT track-based electron isolation, and the bin-by-bin disagreement between data and MC simulation is applied as a systematic uncertainty of the multijet process. The total expected rate is in agreement with the measured value for all the thresholds considered. Most of the rate comes from physics processes of interest such as W and Z production, while a significant but not dominant background comes from jets misidentified as electrons.",

The offline electron is required to pass the tight identification and FCTight isolation requirements. The FCTight isolation requirement is chosen because it is the only one which has a more restrictive isolation configuration than is used online. The sharper efficiency turn-on as a function of E T in 2015 shown in Fig. 17a is due to a looser identification requirement ('lhmedium' versus 'lhtight' from 2016), a lower E T threshold (24 GeV versus 26 GeV from 2016) and no isolation requirement. Although similar identification, isolation, and E T requirements are imposed in the single-electron triggers in 2016-2018, some inefficiency at E T < 60 GeV is observed in 2016. This is explained by the different electron trigger configuration used in 2016, in particular the inefficiency of the calorimeter-only LH selection at the precision step. In 2015-2016, triggers used simulation-based LH and were optimised relative to a different offline selection [41], which results in some inefficiency; however, from 2017 a data-driven likelihood selection and introduction of a looser fast selection with the Ringer algorithm recover the trigger efficiency at E T < 60 GeV. The main remaining sources of inefficiency are the L1 electromagnetic isolation requirements discussed in Sect. 8. As shown in Fig. 17b, the single-electron trigger combination efficiency is lower in the 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52 and |\u03b7| > 2.37 regions, where a significant amount of inactive material is present. Further, detailed investigation into the sources of the inefficiency relative to the offline selection is discussed below. The MC simulation efficiency correction factors, defined in Sect. 7.2 and shown in the lower panels of Fig. 17, are as large as 18% close to the trigger E T threshold and at most 4% above 40 GeV. Their \u03b7-dependence is fairly smooth for 2015 and 2017-2018, with typical values of less than 4% (11%) outside (inside) the |\u03b7| > 2.37 region. These efficiency correction factors are measured with a typical precision of 0.1%. Figure 18 shows the trigger efficiency dependence on pileup. This was reduced towards the end of Run 2. The residual dependence is caused by the isolation requirements both in the HLT and at L1.",

            "text": "Dielectron triggers allow the use of electron E T thresholds at least 9 GeV below those of the single-electron triggers and looser identification and isolation requirements with only a very small increase in HLT rate. The major constraint for dielectron triggers comes from their L1 E T thresholds, while the corresponding HLT rates, shown in Fig. 19, are of the order of 10 Hz, which allow triggers with a very loose selection in the HLT to be kept. The L1_2EM15VH threshold had to be increased to L1_2EM20VH due to rate considerations in 2017. An additional set of dielectron triggers which start from L1_2EM15VHI was introduced. The efficiencies of the dielectron triggers as a function of the offline electron E T shown in Fig. 20a are calculated for a single electron trigger leg of the dielectron trigger. Thus for Table 9 Sources of inefficiency for the e26_lhtight_nod0_ivarloose and e60_lhmedium_nod0 triggers at each selection step in the HLT. Isolation requirements on the precision electron candidate may be applied: if the candidate fails the 'Precision Electron selection' but passes isola-tion, 'Electron selection only' is filled; if the candidate passes the precision electron selection buts fails isolation, 'Isolation only' is filled; if both fail, 'Electron selection and isolation' is filled. Data collected in October 2017 are used for this study  the 2015 dielectron trigger, 2e12_lhloose, the efficiency of e12_lhloose is shown. The dielectron trigger had a lower E T threshold in 2015, and a slightly tighter identification point ('lhloose' instead of 'lhvloose'), which results in a different efficiency curve. The dielectron triggers with an E T threshold of 17 GeV have a lower efficiency in 2017 and 2018 than in previous years for E T below 60 GeV. This is due to the L1 seed, which has an electromagnetic isolation requirement. To recover the lost efficiency, a combination of a lower-E T trigger (isolated at L1) and a higher-E T trigger (with only the L1 hadronic veto applied) is typically used in ATLAS physics analyses. The \u03b7-dependence of the efficiencies of the dielectron trigger legs is shown in Fig. 20b. The efficiency shown is lower in the 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52 and |\u03b7| > 2.37 regions, similar to the single-electron triggers. Outside these regions, efficiencies of dielectron triggers without L1 EM isolation are about 5% lower in the endcaps than in the barrel region, while those for triggers with L1 EM isolation have at most 3% variations. Figure 21 shows the dielectron trigger efficiency as a function of pile-up. It decreases slightly with \u03bc for non-isolated L1 triggers, and has a much stronger \u03bc dependence (due to the L1 electromagnetic isolation requirement) for the isolated L1 triggers.",

The lowest electron-E T threshold used in combined triggers is 7 GeV. The efficiency of the electron leg of this trigger, shown in Fig. 23, is similar to that for the single-electron and dielectron triggers. There are also dedicated triggers which allow events with unusual topologies to be collected. For example, for final states with two closely spaced electrons, standard triggers are not very efficient. This is shown in Fig. 24 for the Higgs boson Dalitz decay H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 ee\u03b3 . The efficiency is measured in a sample of simulated events with m ee < 10 GeV, E \u03b3 T > 35 GeV and both electrons with E T > 15 GeV. A dedicated, cut-based electron identification WP, 'mergedtight', was introduced in 2017, allowing events with two collimated electrons to pass the trigger. As shown in Table 10, this new trigger recovers a significant fraction of events not recorded by the standard diphoton triggers (2g50_loose and g35_medium_g25_medium), especially in the regime of R(ee) < 0.1. An additional requirement on the invariant mass of the photon and dielectron requiring compatibility with the Higgs boson mass is introduced to reduce the background rate, with negligible impact on the signal efficiency.

The number of Z \u2192 ee candidates in the entire run was limited to about 4000, which limited the precision of the trigger efficiency evaluation. In the 2018 PbPb run, a factor of 3.5 more integrated luminosity was provided which resulted in a significant improvement in the number of Z \u2192 ee candidates for electron trigger performance studies. Two electron trigger sequences are activated for data-taking: a cut-based 'loose_ion' trigger with an E T = 20 GeV threshold, and an LH-based 'lhloose_ion' trigger with an E T > 15 GeV requirement. In the latter, the standard pp pdfs are evaluated using the UE-corrected variables. An advantage of the LH-based approach is a significant reduction in the output rate in comparison with the cut-based trigger at the same E T threshold. The LH trigger has significantly better purity at the cost of a moderate loss in trigger efficiency. Figure 25 shows the trigger efficiency as a function of FCal E T and offline electron E T for the 'loose_ion' and 'lhloose_ion' triggers with 20 and 15 GeV thresholds, respectively. The trigger efficiencies are evaluated using the tag-and-probe method on Z \u2192 ee candidate events. Probe electrons are required to pass a version of the loose LH identification optimised for PbPb collisions. The 'loose_ion' trigger is slightly more efficient in the plateau region, which is reached at around 25 GeV in both cases. Both trigger sequences have a small (below 12%) collision-centrality dependence.",

Figure 26 shows the 2018 photon trigger efficiency using the BS method. The efficiency is shown in Fig. 26a as a function of FCal E T , with and without UE subtraction applied in the online reconstruction. When the reconstruction is run without UE subtraction, i.e. in the same manner as done in pp collision data-taking, the efficiency shows a strong dependence on collision centrality. This is primarily due to a strong distortion of the shower shapes and subsequent inefficiency associated with the identification requirements. When the reconstruction is run with the UE subtraction procedure, the photon trigger efficiency remains high across the full range of centralities. In Fig. 26b, the  (offline, calibrated) photon-E T dependence of photon trigger efficiencies using UE subtraction is shown for photon triggers with 15 and 20 GeV E T thresholds. The efficiency is determined with respect to offline reconstructed photons which pass a tighter set of identification cuts, identical to those used in typical physics analyses. The HI photon triggers become fully efficient at about 5 GeV above the nominal online trigger threshold, similar to the photon triggers used for the pp data-taking. During data-taking, the performance of the electron and photon triggers is monitored online while data are being collected, and offline, right after data are recorded. The online monitoring check is performed during the data-taking by shift personnel based in the ATLAS control room at CERN, located at ground level, 100 m above the ATLAS detector, in the Point 1 of the LHC ring. Observables related to electron and photon candidates at different stages of the HLT reconstruction are checked. These observables are defined in the reconstruction and hypothesis-testing algorithms executed online. Only a set of representative electron and photon triggers are monitored online. Monitoring of the full set of triggers would require a large fraction of the HLT farm's computing power and is not necessary, as many of the electron and photon triggers share the same algorithms. In the fast reconstruction step, only the coverage in \u03b7-\u03c6 space and the distributions of E T are monitored for both the electrons and photons. Ringer algorithm variables, track positions, and distances between tracks and calorimeter clusters are monitored for electron triggers. In the precision step, in addition to those observables, the value of \u03bc at the HLT and some calorimeter shower shapes are monitored. For electrons, the distribution of the value of the likelihood discriminant is also monitored.",

The single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 GeV, and rises to 96% at 60 GeV. The trigger efficiency of a 25 GeV leg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of 30 GeV.
