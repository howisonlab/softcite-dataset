            "text": "The D * + s0 (2317) meson, hereinafter referred to as the D * + s0 , was first observed by BaBar as a narrow peak in the D + s \u03c0 0 invariant mass spectrum produced in inclusive e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + s \u03c0 0 X annihilation processes [1,2], and confirmed by CLEO [3]. Its production in the B meson decay processes B \u2192DD * + s0 was subsequently established by both Belle [4] and BaBar [5]. (Here, B andD are used to denote B 0 and D \u2212 or B + andD 0 .) Although it is generally considered to be the conventional I(J P ) = 0(0 + ) Pwave cs meson, its mass, M D * + s0 = 2317.8\u00b10.6 MeV [6,7], is the same as the peak mass of its non-strange counterpart, the 0 + P -wave cq (q = u or d) D * 0 with mass M D * 0 = 2318 \u00b1 29 MeV [6], in spite of the fact that the mass of the s-quark is \u223c 100 MeV above that of either of the q-quarks. Potential model [8] and lattice-QCD [9] calculations published prior to the BaBar discovery predicted that the 0 + P -wave cs meson mass would be well above the m D 0 + m K + = 2358.6 MeV threshold and have a large partial decay width for the strong interaction allowed process D * + s0 \u2192 DK. The observation of a subthreshold mass has led to theoretical speculation that the D * + s0 is not a simple cs meson, but instead a DK molecule [10], a diquark-diantiquark state [11] or some mixture of a cs core state with a DK molecule and/or a diquark-diantiquark [12].",

If this were the case, doubly charged I 3 = 1 (z ++ ) and neutral I 3 = \u22121 (z 0 ) partners of the D * + s0 with mass within \u223c \u00b110 MeV of M D * + s0 should exist. Since the z ++ and z 0 would be charmed mesons with I = 1 and S = 1, they would necessarily have a minimal quark content of csud and csd\u016b, respectively. Although a BaBar search for doubly charged and neutral partners of the D * + s0 in inclusive e + e \u2212 annihilation events sets 95% CL upper limits on their production rates at 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively, of that for the D * + s0 [17], Terasaki has argued that these do not conclusively rule out their existence [18].

            "text": "We report measurements of the product branching fractions B(B + \u2192D 0 D * + s0 ) \u00d7 B(D * + s0 \u2192 D + s \u03c0 0 ) = (8.0 +1.3 \u22121.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 D * + s0 ) \u00d7 B(D * + s0 \u2192 D + s \u03c0 0 ) = (10.2 +1.3 \u22121.2 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Here, the first errors are statistical, the second are systematic and the third are from D and D + s branching fractions. These values agree with the existing PDG world average values [6], significantly improve upon their precision, and supersede those of Ref. [4]. In addition, we report negative results on a search for hypothesized doubly charged and neutral isospin partners of the D * + s0 and provide upper limits on the product branching fractions that are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the theoretical predictions of Hayashigaki and Terasaki [16].",
