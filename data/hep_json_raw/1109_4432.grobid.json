It is an important property of the SM prediction at leading order (LO) that the interference between the amplitudes in Fig. 1 produces a zero in the total W \u03b3 yield at a specific angle \u03b8 * between the W boson and the incoming quark [3] in the W \u03b3 rest frame. Since in hadronic collisions the longitudinal momenta of neutrinos from W decay cannot be measured, the angle \u03b8 * at which the radiation amplitude is zero is difficult to measure directly. However, the radiation amplitude zero (RAZ) is also visible in the charge-signed photon-lepton rapidity difference as a dip around \u22121/3 [4]. In this Letter, we present measurements of the cross section and the distribution of the charge-signed photonlepton rapidity difference for W \u03b3 production as well as a search for anomalous W W \u03b3 couplings, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 fb \u22121 collected by the D0 detector at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. W \u03b3 production has been studied previously at hadron colliders [5][6][7][8][9]. The latest published D0 result [8] represent the most stringent constraints on anomalous W W \u03b3 couplings, and include the first study of the charge-signed photon-lepton rapidity difference at a hadron collider. The results of the present analysis provide a significant improvement in the sensitivity to W W \u03b3 couplings through a nearly factor of six increase in data and by using an artificial neural network for photon identification.",

            "text": "Trigger and lepton identification efficiencies are measured using Z \u2192 ll (l = e, \u00b5) data. Parts of the photon identification efficiency which rely exclusively on calorimeter information are also determined using Z \u2192 ee data. The photon track veto efficiencies are determined using Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 \u03b3 events, where the photons are radiated from charged leptons in Z boson decays. The selected data sample is contaminated by the following backgrounds: (i) W +jet events with a jet misidentified as a photon; (ii) \"leX\" events with a lepton, electron, and / E T with the electron misidentified as a photon; (iii) Z\u03b3 \u2192 ll\u03b3 events containing an unidentified lepton; and (iv) W \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03b3 events with the \u03c4 decaying to e or \u00b5. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to model the W \u03b3 signal, as well as the Z\u03b3 \u2192 ll\u03b3 and W \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03b3 backgrounds. The signal is simulated using the Baur and Berger LO event generator [2], interfaced to pythia [16] for subsequent parton showering and hadronization. The shape and normalization of the signal E \u03b3 T spectrum are reweighted to the next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction [4]. The acceptance of the kinematic and geometric requirements for this analysis is calculated using this E \u03b3 T -weighted signal MC. The Z\u03b3 \u2192 ll\u03b3 and W \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03b3 background processes are simulated with pythia. All MC events are generated using the CTEQ6L1 [17] parton distribution functions (PDF), followed by a geant [18] simulation of the D0 detector. To accurately model the effects of multiple pp interactions and detector noise, data from random pp crossings are overlaid on the MC events. The instantaneous luminosity spectrum of these overlaid events is matched to that of the events used in the data analysis. The simulated events are processed  using the same reconstruction code that is used for data. W +jet production is the dominant background for both the electron and muon channels. To estimate this background, the fraction of jets that pass the photon selection criteria but fail either the p sum T trk or the shower width requirement, as determined by using a multijet data sample, is parameterized as a function of E \u03b3 T and \u03b7 \u03b3 . The background from W +jet production is then estimated starting from an data sample obtained by reversing the requirements either on p sum T trk or on shower width requirement, and applying the same parameterization. As a cross-check, the W +jet background is also estimated through a fit to the O N N distribution in data, using MC templates constructed from generated photon and jet events. The result is in good agreement with that obtained from the ratio method. The \"leX\" background is also estimated from an orthogonal data sample by requiring the electron candidate to be matched to a high-quality track. The number of \"leX\" events is obtained by using this orthogonal data sample, taking into account the ratio of the track-matching inefficiency to the track matching efficiency obtained from Z \u2192 ee data. Events in the electron channel that have both the electron and photon in the EC are excluded from this analysis, because of the poor acceptance for signal and the presence of overwhelming background. The number of predicted and observed events in both the electron and muon channels are summarized in Table I.",
