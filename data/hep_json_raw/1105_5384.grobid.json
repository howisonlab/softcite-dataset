We consider final states with at least two jets and two leptons (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5), and events with one jet for the the e\u00b5 final state as well. The measured cross section is \u03c3 tt =7.36 +0.90 \u22120.79 (stat + syst) pb. This result combined with the cross section measurement in the lepton + jets final state yields \u03c3 tt =7.56 +0.63   \u22120.56 (stat + syst) pb, which agrees with the standard model expectation. The relative precision of 8% of this measurement is comparable to the precision of the latest theoretical calculations.",

Comparing the standard model (SM) prediction with the measured \u03c3 tt value allows testing for the presence of physics beyond the SM, for instance, scenarios in which the top quark would decay into a charged Higgs boson and a b quark [5].",

This result supersedes our previous measurement [9], which used a dataset five times smaller than the one considered here. The CDF Collaboration has measured \u03c3 tt in the \u2113\u2113 \u2032 channel using 2.8 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity [10]. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations recently published their first \u03c3 tt measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [11,12]. The D0 detector is described in detail in [13]. The region of the D0 detector closest to the interaction region contains a tracking system consisting of a silicon microstrip tracker and a central fiber tracker, both located inside a superconducting solenoid magnet which generates a magnetic field of 2 T. Hits in these two detectors are used to reconstruct tracks from charged particles in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 3 [30]. Surrounding the two tracking subdetectors are liquid-argon uranium calorimeters, segmented into electromagnetic and hadronic sections. The central section of the calorimeter (CC) covers pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 1.1, and the two end calorimeters (EC) extend coverage to |\u03b7| \u2248 4.2 with all three housed in separate cryostats. The muon system surrounds the calorimeter and consists of three layers of tracking detectors and scintillator trigger counters covering |\u03b7| < 2. A toroidal iron magnet with a field of 1.8 T is located outside the innermost layer of the muon detector. The luminosity is calculated from the rate of inelastic pp collisions measured with plastic scintillator arrays located in front of the EC cryostats [14].",

In the \u00b5\u00b5 final state, we apply these loose isolation criteria only to one randomly chosen muon. In the e\u00b5 channel, the number of events with jets misidentified as electrons in the same sign sample is subtracted from N loose . The misidentification rate, f \u00b5 , is determined in a dimuon sample with at least one jet. In this sample we require one muon to be close to the jet (R(\u00b5, jet) < 0.5) with reversed isolation criteria E \u00b5,iso T /p \u00b5 T > 0.15 and p \u00b5,iso T /p \u00b5 T > 0.15. The other muon defined as the probe, should pass the loose isolation criteria E \u00b5,iso T /p \u00b5 T < 0.5 and p \u00b5,iso T /p \u00b5 T < 0.5. We compute f \u00b5 as the ratio of the number of events in which the probe muon passes the tight isolation criteria to the total number of events in this same sign sample. The systematic uncertainty on the f \u00b5 determination is about 10% and results mainly from the statistical uncertainty due to the limited size of the sample used for the muon misidentification rate calculation and the potential dependence of the misidentification rate on p T and / p T . The number of predicted background events as well as the expected number of signal events in the four channels are shown in Table I. The tt events have two b quark jets in the final state, but most of the background events have jets produced by light quarks or gluons. In order to achieve a better separation between signal and background when measuring the cross section, we use the distribution of the smallest of the two b-tagging NN discriminants of the two leading jets. If a jet does not satisfy the requirements to enter the NN computation (non-taggable jet), a value of -1 is assigned to it. These NN discriminant distributions for the different channels are shown in Fig. 1 We measure the tt cross section \u03c3 tt by simultaneously fitting the NN distributions in the four channels and maximizing the likelihood function",
