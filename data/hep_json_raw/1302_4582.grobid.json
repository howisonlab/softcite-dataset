The angle plays a unique role among all CP-violating parameters because it can be determined using pure tree-level decays of B mesons without theoretical uncertainties. As tree-level measurements are expected to be insensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), the value of determined in this way provides an important SM benchmark against which other measurements, more likely to be a\u21b5ected by phyics beyond the SM, can be compared. The power of this approach to new physics searches relies on precise measurements. Despite results from B-factories and Tevatron have improved considerably the knowledge of the UT angles and sides, is still the least-well determined angle, with an experimental uncertainty from treelevel measurements of 9 12 [1,2]. This precision can be significantly improved with large datasets at LHCb.",

Di\u21b5erent methods exist to determine these and other D hadronic parameters from data without theoretical uncertainties. Three types of D decays have been studied by LHCb, corresponding to three well-established methods to determine and all the unknown parameters: the GLW method [4,5]), which uses decays to CP eigenstates (D ! K + K and D ! \u21e1 + \u21e1 ); the ADS method [6]), which uses decays to quasi-specific flavour eigenstates (D ! K + \u21e1 and D !

Time-integrated measurements can also be performed with neutral b-hadrons when the concerned decay is selftagged. This is the case of B 0 !

DK + decays, hence the system can exhibit large CP-violating e\u21b5ects. The invariant mass distribution of the selected D(K + K )K \u21e40 candidates is shown in Fig. 7. In addition to the B 0 mass peak, also a peak at the B 0 s mass is observed. The B 0 s ! DK \u21e40 decay is used as control channel, as no large CP violation is expected in this mode. The CP asymmetries, computed from the e ciency-corrected signal yields, are found to be  for B 0 and B 0 s , respectively. Other results for the GLW observables can be found in Ref. [8]. These are the first measurements of CP asymmetries in B 0 and B 0 s to DK \u21e40 decays with the neutral D meson decaying into a CP-even final state. With more data, improved measurements of these and other quantities in B 0 ! DK \u21e40 decays will set important constraints on . The first preliminary measurement of time-dependent CP violation observables in B 0 s ! D \u2325 s K \u00b1 decays has recently been reported by LHCb [9]. This measurement is unique to LHCb, because it is the only existing experiment which has accumulated a su ciently large sample of B 0 s decays and is able to distinguish the rapid B 0 s -B 0 s oscillations (thanks to its excellent proper-time resolution and the boost of the B 0 s mesons at LHC). Additional ex-  perimental challenges for this measurement are related to the e ciency of the flavour-tagging algorithms and the determination of the proper-time acceptance. The LHCb results include both untagged and flavour-tagged candidates. Untagged events carry additional sensitivity to the weak phase since the decay width di\u21b5erence in the B 0 s system, s , is sizeably di\u21b5erent from zero. The mass distribution of the total sample is shown in Fig. 8, and the propertime distribution in Fig. 9, where the contribution of all the di\u21b5erent components to the combined sample can be appreciated. The results on the CP observables can be found in [9]. The correlations between the systematic uncertainties have an important impact on the determination of 2 s and require further studies. No attempt has been made at this stage to derive confidence intervals for the weak phase.",
