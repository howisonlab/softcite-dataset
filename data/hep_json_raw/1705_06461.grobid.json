            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM) version where only one Higgs doublet is included and massless neutrinos are assumed, lepton flavor conservation is an automatic consequence of gauge invariance and the renormalizability of the SM Lagrangian. However measurements of the neutrino mixing parameters during the last decades [2] showed that lepton flavor is not conserved. Including finite neutrino mass terms in the SM Lagrangian charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is also predicted. CLFV transitions are suppressed by sums over \u2206m 2 ij /M 2 W 2 , where \u2206m 2 ij is mass-squared difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates i, j and M W is the W boson mass [3]. Because the neutrino mass difference is very small (\u2206m 2 ij \u2264 10 \u22123 eV 2 [2]) with respect to the W boson mass, the expected branching ratios reach values below 10 \u221250 [3,4], which are unmeasurable by the present facilities. As a consequence, an observation of CLFV process would represent a clear evidence of new physics beyond the SM. In the last decades LFV processes were studied within the supersymmetric extensions of the SM (SUSY) [5,3] and in particular within the supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY GUT) [6,7]. In SUSY models there is a new source of flavor mixing in the mass matrices of SUSY partners for leptons and quarks, called sleptons and squarks respectively. Flavor mixing in the slepton mass matrix would induce LFV processes for charged leptons. In the SUSY GUT scenario, the flavor mixing in the slepton sector is naturally induced at the GUT scale because leptons and quarks belong to the same GUT multiplet [5]. In general, CLFV can be studied via a large variety of processes: muon decays, such as \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 , \u00b5 \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 e \u2212 e + , and muon conversion; tau decays:",

Another relevant background comes from the radiative pion capture (RPC) process \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2192 \u03b3N * , followed by the electron-positron pair conversion of the \u03b3. Another source of background are pions; muon beam is generated from low energy protons (below 10 GeV of energy) interacting with a (production) target, so producing charged pions that then decay in a transport line. Unfortunately not all pions decay in the transport line, and, consequently, the muon beam is contaminated by pion. This source of background is reduced thanks to the difference between the pion and the bound muon life times. The pion has a \u03c4 < few tens of ns, while the bound muon has a mean lifetime of the order of several hundreds of ns (depending on the Z of the material [10]). Therefore using a pulsed beam structure, it is possible to define a live-gate delayed with respect to the beam arrival, and to reduce the \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2192 \u03b3N * contribution to the desired level. Other beam-related sources of background are: remnant electrons in the beam that scatter in the stopping target, muon decays in flight, and antiprotons annihilating in or near the stopping target.",

In 1989, the Soviet Journal of Nuclear Physics published a letter to the editor from physicists Vladimir Lobashev and Rashid Djilkibaev, where they proposed an experiment that would perform the most thorough search yet for muonto-electron flavor violation. In 1992, they proposed the MELC experiment at the Moscow Meson Factory [12], but then, due to the political and economic crisis, in 1995 the experiment shut down. The same overall scheme was subsequently adopted in the Brookhaven National Laboratory MECO proposal in 1997 [13].

The Mu2e detector consists of a low-mass straw tube tracker and a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter. The tracker is assembled of 5 mm diameter straw tubes. The straws are made of 15 \u00b5m thick metalized Mylar and have 25 \u00b5m sense wires. The tracker has about 20k straws combined in 18 tracking stations over a total length of about 3 m [14]. The straw tubes are orthogonal to the DS axis, and occupy an annulus with radii from 36 to 70 cm. Two layers of straws form a panel, 6 panels rotated with respect to each other form a plane, and a tracking station is made of two rotated planes. Only a small fraction of the DIO electrons fall into the tracker acceptance. The inner radius of the tracker planes is such that only electrons with energies greater than about 53 MeV fall into the tracker volume: lower energy electrons curl in the solenoidal field and pass unobstructed through the hole in the center of the tracker. Because most of the electrons have energy smaller than 60 MeV, a large fraction of them (97%) do not reach the tracker. The momentum resolution is pivotal for eliminating the background, and it is required to be better than few hundreds of keV/c [14]. The calorimeter consists of two disks with an inner (outer) radius of 37.4 (66) cm, and a relative distance of 75 cm. Each disk is composed of about 600 pure CsI crystals read out by Silicon Photomultipliers. The crystal size is 3.4 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 20 cm 3 . Simulation studies and beam tests with a reduced scale prototype [15] showed that the calorimeter performance for 100 MeV electrons are: a timing resolution of about 100 ps, and an energy resolution of about 5%. Calorimeter information allows to improve track reconstruction, and to provide a particle identification tool. The calorimeter may also be used to trigger high energy electron candidates, reducing the throughput of the data acquisition system. A cosmic ray veto system is also present to veto atmospheric muons that can interact in the DS, generating fake CE candidates. Figure 4 shows the signal and the DIO background yield, normalized to 3 years of data taking. Same Figure shows that if we define a narrow momentum window (signal window) around the signal peak, the mean expected background from the DIO electrons is about 0.2 events, while assuming R \u00b5e = 10 \u221216 the signal yield is expected to be about 3.5 events. It has also been shown in reference [14] that the contribution from the other background sources adds 0.3 events in the signal window.",
