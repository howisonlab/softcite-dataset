In a LArTPC, single electron tracks can be distinguished from gamma rays that have converted to e + \u2212e \u2212 pairs by utilizing the conversion length of the gamma ray and dE dx of the electron. Thus, MicroBooNE should have excellent particle identification for \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance oscillation experiments, where gamma rays are backgrounds. This discrimination power can be used to study the MiniBooNE low energy excess [6], which is not currently understood. If this excess is made by misidentification of a gamma ray, either from a known or unknown source, MicroBooNE can reject them.",

An imposed electric field (500 V/cm) causes the ionization to drift toward readout anode wire planes and be collected. The signals from the wire planes provide 2 dimensional information about the event. The drift time of the ionization electrons gives the third coordinate. In other words, the time information is \"projected\" onto the third dimension. The combined wire and time information allows the tracks to be reconstructed in three dimensions. (Right) A drawing of the MicroBooNE cryostat with the TPC and PMT arrays on the left wall. Table 1 summarizes the MicroBooNE parameters. This bigger detector guarantees more neutrino interactions, although it also requires a longer drift length of ionized electrons in order to see the charged particle tracks. As such, the liquid Argon is required to have a higher purity. For MicroBooNE, to preserve >50% of electrons to be drifted without attaching to electro-negative impurities, we need to achieve \u223c 100 ppt level of oxygen-equivalent impurity concentration [7]. For this goal, we have several test facilities. The Fermilab MTS cryostat \"LUKE\" (Figure 2, left) has a window at the airlock region. The test material is inserted and sample cage is lowered into the LUKE volume, which is filled with high purity liquid Argon. The impurity is monitored in the Argon gas and liquid regions. All materials used inside of the MicroBooNE cryostat are required to be tested by MTS.",

A series of recent electron scattering experiments, mainly from JLab, show an emerging view, namely, (1) for a heavy nuclei, \u223c20% of nucleons are in a 2NSRC state [16], (2) 90% are protonneutron pair [17], and (3) 2 ejected nucleons are kinematically correlated [18]. In a \u03bd \u00b5 CC interaction, this interaction signature is a triple coincidence; a muon with 2 correlated protons,",

            "text": "The \u03bd2NSRC is interesting for neutrino scattering in three different ways. First, 2NSRC is not confirmed to occur in neutrino scattering 1 . Second, nuclear break-up by 2NSRC is not studied via electron scattering, because typical electron scattering experiments use long arm spectrometers [20]. On the other hand, neutrino experiments use vertex detectors, so neutrino experiments can measure energy release from the vertex. Third, there is wide-spread speculation that \u03bd2NSRC may contribute to recent large neutrino cross section results from MiniBooNE [12,21], SciBooNE [22], and MINOS [23]. All modern neutrino experiments have measured higher cross sections than have been predicted, except NOMAD [24] and MINERvA preliminary result [25]. In the theories [26,27,28], 2NSRC enhances generally hard to identify multi-nucleon emission channels. However, high resolution LArTPC has the ability to track protons, and it has the potential to identify \u03bd2NSRC for the first time in history. This process may shed light on neutrino cross section measurements around 1 GeV.",
