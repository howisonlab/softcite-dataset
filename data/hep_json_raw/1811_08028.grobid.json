We find evidence for the decays \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 and \u03a3 + \u03b7 with statistical significance of 2.5\u03c3 and 3.2\u03c3, respectively. Normalizing to the reference decays \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 and \u03a3 + \u03c9, we obtain the ratios of the branching fractions ",

Contrary to the significant progress made in the studies of heavy meson decays, the progress in both theoretical and experimental studies of heavy baryon decays is relatively sparse. The \u039b + c was first observed at the Mark II experiment in 1979 [8], but only about 60% of its decays have been accounted for so far and the rest still remain unknown [9].",

            "text": "The two-body Cabibbo-favored (CF) decay of the \u039b + c to an octet baryon and a pseudoscalar meson, \u039b + c \u2192 B( 1 2 + )P , is one of the simplest hadronic channels to be treated theoretically [10], and measurements of the branching fractions (BFs) can be used to calibrate different theoretical approaches. Recently, BESIII has studied twelve CF \u039b + c decay modes, among which the absolute BFs for B( 1 2 + )P decays \u039b + c \u2192 pK 0 S , \u039b\u03c0 + , \u03a3 0 \u03c0 + and \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 are significantly improved in precision [11]. However, other CF modes are only known with poor precision, or even have not been explored yet. The CF decays \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 and \u03a3 + \u03b7 proceed entirely through nonfactorizable internal W -emission and W -exchange diagrams, as shown in Fig. 1, and are particularly interesting. Unlike the case for charmed meson decays, these nonfactorizable decays are free from color and helicity suppressions and are quite sizable. Theoretical predictions on these nonfactorizable effects are not reliable, however, resulting in very large variations of the predicted BFs, e.g., B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7) = (0.11 \u2212 0.94)%, and B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 ) = (0.1 \u2212 1.28)% [3][4][5][6]. On the experimental side, only evidence for \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 has been reported by CLEO [12] with a BF of (0.70 \u00b1 0.23)%, and the channel \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 is yet to be observed. Hence, further experimental studies of these two decay modes are essential for testing different theoretical models and for a better understanding of the \u039b + c CF decays. In this work, BFs for \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 and \u03a3 + \u03b7 are measured with respect to the CF modes \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 and \u03a3 + \u03c9, respectively, by analyzing 567 pb \u22121 [13] data taken at \u221a s = 4.6 GeV [14] with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. Throughout this paper, charge-conjugate modes are always implied.",

            "text": "In summary, by analyzing a data sample of e + e \u2212 collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb \u22121 taken at a center-of-mass energy of 4.6 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we find evidence for the decays \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 and \u03a3 + \u03b7 with statistical significance of 2.5\u03c3 and 3.3\u03c3. The BFs for \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 and \u03a3 + \u03b7 with respect to those of the reference decay modes of \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 and \u03a3 + \u03c9 are  shown in Table 4. The central value of B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7) presented in this work is smaller than that from CLEO [12], while they are compatible within 1\u03c3 of uncertainty. The BF of \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 is measured for the first time, which stands a discrepancy about 2\u03c3 of uncertainty from the most of the theoretical predictions, but in good agreement with the prediction in Ref. [5]. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the obtained B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7 ) is larger than B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03b7), the corresponding ratio is determined to be B(\u039b + c \u2192\u03a3 + \u03b7 ) B(\u039b + c \u2192\u03a3 + \u03b7) = 3.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 0.4, which contradicts with the predictions in Refs. [3,4]. However, the precision of the current results is still poor and further constraints demand improved measurements.",
