The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 2 fb \u22121 collected in 2015-2016 by the LHCb collaboration in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The D 0 candidate is required to originate from a D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decay, allowing the determination of the flavour of the D 0 meson using the pion charge.

            "text": "In the Standard Model, violation of charge-parity (CP ) symmetry originates from the presence of a single phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1]. Experimental results support the CKM mechanism for CP violation, but additional sources of CP violation are needed to explain cosmological observations of the relative abundance of matter and antimatter in the universe [2]. In the charm sector, CP violation has not yet been observed, but measurements of CP asymmetries in Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 \u2192 h + h \u2212 decays (h = \u03c0, K) have reached 0.2% and 0.03% precision for time-integrated [3] and indirect CP asymmetries [4], respectively. The D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S decay is a promising discovery channel for CP violation in charm decays [5]. Only loop-suppressed amplitudes and exchange diagrams that vanish in the SU(3) flavour limit contribute to this decay. These amplitudes can have different strong and weak phases and are of similar size. The time-integrated CP asymmetry, A CP , in D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S decays may therefore be enhanced to an observable level [6], and could be as large as 1.1% [5]. Examples of such diagrams are shown in figure 1. The most precise measurement of this asymmetry to date, A CP (K 0 S K 0 S ) = (\u22120.02 \u00b1 1.53 \u00b1 0.17)%, has been performed by the Belle collaboration [7]. Earlier measurements were also performed by the LHCb [8] and CLEO [9] collaborations. This article reports a new measurement of A CP in the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S using LHCb data collected in 2015 and 2016. The measurement of the CP asymmetry, defined as requires knowledge of the flavour of the D 0 meson at production. A sample of flavour-tagged D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S decays is obtained by selecting D * + mesons that are produced in the primary interaction (hereafter referred to as prompt), with the subsequent decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + . 1 The charge of the pion in this decay identifies the flavour of the accompanying D 0 meson. The effect of D 0 \u2212 D 0 mixing [10] is negligible compared to the precision of this analysis and is not considered further.",

The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The magnetic field deflects oppositely-charged particles in opposite directions and this can lead to detection asymmetries. Periodically reversing the magnetic field polarity throughout the data taking almost cancels the effect. The configuration with the magnetic field pointing upwards (downwards), MagUp (MagDown), bends positively (negatively) charged particles in the horizontal plane towards the centre of the LHC ring. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse-energy deposit in the calorimeters.",

These categories are referred to as long and downstream, respectively. The long category has better mass, momentum and decay-vertex resolution than the downstream category. In this analysis at least one K 0 S in each D 0 decay is required to be of the long type. There are therefore two subsamples used: one where both K 0 S candidates are long and the other where one is long and the other is downstream. These are referred to as the LL and LD subsamples, and are analysed separately, since they exhibit different resolutions. One or more of the charged decay products from a long K 0 S meson is required to activate the first stage of the software trigger. The pion candidates used in the K 0 S reconstruction are required to be high-quality tracks, using the \u03c7 2 /ndf of the track fit and the output P fake of a multivariate classifier, trained to identify fake tracks, that combines information from the particle identification and tracking systems. To ensure that pion candidates do not originate from the PV, they are required to satisfy \u03c7 2 IP > 36. The quantity \u03c7 2 IP for a given particle is defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the PV associated to the particle, reconstructed with and without the particle being considered. For downstream K 0 S candidates, the pions are required to satisfy p > 3 GeV/c and p T > 175 MeV/c. Two oppositely charged pions are used to form K 0 S candidates. The vertex fit is required to satisfy \u03c7 2 < 30 and the \u03c7 2 IP is required to be greater than 9 (4) for long (downstream) K 0 S candidates. Furthermore, long (downstream) K 0 S candidates are required to satisfy p T > 500 (750) MeV/c. Two reconstructed K 0 S candidates are paired to form D 0 candidates, requiring \u03c7 2 < 10 for the vertex fit. The sum of the p T of the K 0 S candidates is required to exceed 1500 (2000) MeV/c for LL (LD) candidates. The angle between the D 0 momentum and the vector connecting the PV to the D 0 decay vertex is required to be less than 34.6 mrad. The measured decay time of the D 0 meson is required to be greater than 0.2 ps. Finally, the D 0 mass is required to be within 20 MeV/c 2 of the known value [10].",

Possible bias in the fitting procedure is evaluated using simulated pseudoexperiments. In particular, the uncertainty related to the choice of the signal model is evaluated by using the nominal model to fit samples generated with two alternative -8 -  models for the signal PDF: either a sum of two Gaussians with a common mean (for the LL sample) or a single Gaussian (for the LD sample). The background PDF is varied by modifying its behaviour at threshold. Systematic uncertainties of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 0.01 for the LL and LD samples, respectively, are assigned based on this study. As a cross-check, the background shapes are constrained to be the same for the D * + and D * \u2212 samples, and the resulting asymmetry is compatible with the nominal. For the D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 fit, an alternative procedure is used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty associated with the signal PDF. In this case, the signal region (\u00b12.5 MeV/c 2 around the signal mean) is excluded and only the background shape is fit. The yield is then determined by estimating the background in the signal region by interpolating the fitted background function. Additionally, alternative background shapes are tried, varying the degree of the polynomial. Based on these studies a systematic uncertainty of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 is assigned to A raw (K + K \u2212 ). The contribution of the residual background of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays to the fitted LL and LD signal yields is estimated to be (3.5 \u00b1 0.7)% and (5.5 \u00b1 4.6)%, respectively. These values are combined with the K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background asymmetry, determined from background-dominated regions of the \u03c7 2 FD distributions, to estimate contributions to the systematic uncertainty of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , for the LL and LD samples. Another contribution comes from the residual fraction of secondary decays, which leads to a systematic uncertainty for this source of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for the LL and LD samples. In this case an upper limit of 0.02 for the maximum difference in the production asymmetries of D * \u00b1 mesons and b-hadrons is assumed [23][24][25].",

The sum in quadrature of the difference (albeit not statistically significant) and of its statistical uncertainty is assigned as a systematic uncertainty, which accounts for residual trigger-induced biases in the difference of measured asymmetries for signal and control channels. This uncertainty amounts to -9 -  Table 2. Systematic uncertainties on the quantities A raw and \u2206A CP . The total systematic uncertainties in the last row are obtained by summing the corresponding contributions in each column in quadrature. Uncertainties are expressed in units of 10 \u22123 . 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for both the LL and LD samples. The small probability of assigning the wrong charge to the \u03c0 \u00b1 tag candidate results in a systematic uncertainty of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for both the LL and LD samples. This is obtained by varying the selection on the P fake value of \u03c0 \u00b1 tag candidates. This uncertainty cancels for \u2206A CP . For each neutral kaon in the final state, asymmetries arising from regeneration and from mixing and CP violation in the K 0 \u2212 K 0 system are suppressed at the O(10 \u22123 ) level [26].

The offline selection of the two channels aims to keep the kinematics as similar as possible, but the different trigger selections on the final states can introduce differences. The associated systematic uncertainty is evaluated by considering four kinematic variables: the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of the D * + candidate and the \u03c0 + tag candidate, respectively. For each variable a one-dimensional weighting is performed on the D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 events such that they have the same distribution as the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S sample. Then A raw (K + K \u2212 ) is determined from the weighted sample. This is repeated for each of the four kinematic variables. The largest change in A raw (K + K \u2212 ) is taken as the systematic uncertainty and this is found to be 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for both the LL and LD samples.
