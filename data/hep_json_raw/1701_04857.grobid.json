The measurements span the energy range 2-22 GeV and were performed using forward and reversed horn focusing modes of the Fermilab low-energy NuMI beam to obtain large neutrino and antineutrino samples. The flux is obtained using a sub-sample of charged-current events at low hadronic energy transfer along with precise higher energy external neutrino cross section data overlapping with our energy range between 12-22 GeV. We also report on the antineutrino-neutrino cross section ratio, RCC , which does not rely on external normalization information. Our ratio measurement, obtained within the same experiment using the same technique, benefits from the cancellation of common sample systematic uncertainties and reaches a precision of \u223c5% at low energy. Our results for the antineutrino-nucleus scattering cross section and for RCC are the most precise to date in the energy range E\u03bd < 6 GeV.",

For appropriate baselines and energies, neutrino oscillation phenomena produce distinct shape signatures on either \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e or \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance probabilities, which, in matter, depend on the CP violating phase (\u03b4 CP ) and the (unknown) sign of the mass splitting term, \u2206m 2 31 . Variations of oscillation parameters over their allowed ranges produce degenerate effects on the appearance probabilities, complicating these measurements. Uncertainties in poorly constrained cross section components in this energy range produce further competing shape effects on the measured visible energy spectra used to extract the oscillation probabilities. Utilizing beams of both neutrinos and antineutrinos allows a measurement of the CP asymmetry [3], A CP , defined as,",

Reducing uncertainties on the cross sections, and in particular their ratio, R CC = \u03c3 \u03bd /\u03c3 \u03bd , to which A CP is primarily sensitive, is essential to achieving ultimate sensitivity in oscillation measurements. The results presented here use neutrino and antineutrino events analyzed in the MINERvA scintillator (CH) detector exposed to the NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam. Total cross sections are extracted from selected charged-current (CC) event samples, and incident fluxes are measured in situ using a sub-sample of these events at low-\u03bd (\u03bd is the energy transfered to the hadronic system) as in our previous result [4]. The ratio, R CC , is obtained by forming ratios of measured event rates in the two beam modes. Since the measurements are performed using the same apparatus and flux measurement technique, common detector and model related systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio, resulting in a precise measurable quantity that can be leveraged to tune models and improve knowledge of interaction cross sections.",

The cross section ratio, R CC , has recently been measured by MINOS [6] on iron with a precision of \u223c7% at 6 GeV. At lower energies, only one dedicated measurement [7] (on CF 3 Br) has been performed, with a precision of \u223c20%. Measurements on a range of nuclear targets are needed to constrain nuclear dependence which currently contributes significantly to modeling uncertainty. While much of the existing data is on an iron nucleus, this result provides data on a light nuclear target (carbon). We improve on the precision of both the antineutrino cross section and R CC (by nearly a factor of four) at low energies (2)(3)(4)(5)(6).",

This model incorporates improved modeling of low-\u03bd cross section components and is similar to that described in Ref. [15]. GENIE 2.8.4 uses a modified version of the relativistic Fermi gas model of the nucleus, which is inadequate to precisely describe neu-trino scattering data at low three-momentum transfer such as quasi-elastic (QE) and \u2206(1232) resonance production. For QE events, we use the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [22] model, which includes long-range nucleon-nucleon correlations to more accurately characterize scattering from a nucleon bound in a nucleus. We also include the Valencia \"2p2h\" model contribution [23] of the neutrino interacting with a correlated nucleon pair that populates the energy transfer region between the QE and \u2206-resonance events. Since even this does not adequately cover the observed signal excess in this region [15], we include additional modeling uncertainties from this contribution. In addition, we reduce the GE-NIE single pion non-resonant component 1 with initial state \u03bd + n (or\u03bd + p) by 57%, which has been shown to improve agreement with observed deuterium data [24].",

We separate experimental acceptance terms into two contributions. The term A \u03bd(\u03bd),DET CC , which represents the ratio of the number of events generated in a given neutrino energy bin to the number reconstructed in our event sample, accounts for detector resolution smearing and bin migration effects. Final state interaction (FSI) effects, which arise from reinteractions of emerging final state particles in the target nucleus, change the measured hadronic energy and also affect A \u03a6 (E) and is nearly generator model independent. The kinematic acceptance, A KIN CC , defined as the ratio of all generated events in a given bin to those with muon energy E \u00b5 >1.8 GeV and angle \u03b8 \u00b5 < 0.35 rad, must be applied to obtain a total cross section from the fiducial event rate. This term is computed directly from a generator level model. It is tabulated for our default model along with other model-dependent corrections in Table III. Nearly all muons in the selected flux sample automatically pass the kinematic cuts (except for a small fraction in the first energy bin which is computed to be 5.1% using the GENIE-Hybrid model and 4.9% using NuWro [14]). We therefore only report one acceptance, A \u03a6 , which includes the kinematic contribution in the flux sample. Figure 3 shows the size of the acceptance correction terms for each sample. Kinematic acceptance is most important at lowest energies (primarily below 3 GeV), which have the largest fraction of events below muon energy threshold. The kinematic thresholds result in poorer overall acceptance at all energies for neutrinos compared with antineutrinos. This is a consequence of the different inelasticity (y = \u03bd/E \u03bd ) dependence of the two cross sections, which produce a harder muon energy distribution for antineutrinos with correspondingly more forward-going muons. The flux sample with the \u03bd < \u03bd 0 requirement also selects a harder muon spectrum and results in better corresponding acceptance relative to the   inclusive sample in both modes. The detector acceptance is above 50% for neutrino energies greater than 5 GeV. The shapes of 1/A DET CC and 1/A \u03a6 are affected by the MI-NOS ND sampling geometry as well as the two methods of measuring momentum (from range and from curvature), which have different resolution. The dip in the 6-10 GeV region results from the contained (range) momentum sample decreasing while the curvature sample, which has poorer resolution, is becoming dominant.",

A small component of energy loss uncertainty in MINERvA is also taken into account. The hadronic response uncertainty is studied by incorporating an individual response uncertainty for each final state particle produced at the hadronic vertex in the neutrino interaction. A small-scale functionally-equivalent detector in a test beam [28] was used to assess energy responses and their uncertainties, which are found to be 3.5% for protons, and 5% for \u03c0 \u00b1 and K. In addition to the test beam study, information from in situ Michel electron and \u03c0 0 samples is used to determine the 3% uncertainty in electromagnetic response. Low-energy neutrons have the largest uncertainties (25% for kinetic energies < 50 MeV and 10-20% for > 50 MeV), which are estimated by benchmarking GEANT4 [29] neutron cross sections against nA \u2192 pX measurements in this energy range.

The GENIE parameters that control FSI effects include mean free path, reaction probabilities, nuclear size, formation time and hadronization model variation. The largest FSI uncertainty, due to the pion mean free path within the nucleus, is up to 2% (3%) for cross sections (fluxes). We separately evaluate the uncertainties from the tuned model components (RPA, single pion non-resonant, and 2p2h) discussed in Sec. III. We include half the difference between the default GENIE 2.8.4 and the implemented RPA model in quadrature into the total model uncertainty. We assume a 15% uncertainty in the retuned non-resonant single pion production component. After incorporating the 2p2h model, a sizable discrepancy in the hadronic energy distribution with the data remains. To assess an additional uncertainty from this unmodeled contribution, we fit the data excess at low hadronic energy described in Ref. [15] in the neutrino energy range 2 < E \u03bd < 6 GeV (taking into account separately proton-proton and proton-neutron initial states) to obtain a corrected model [30,31]. We take the uncertainty as the difference of the result obtained with this data-driven model, from the nominal result. The MIN-ERvA antineutrino data also show an excess in the same region. We apply the corrected model from neutrino described above and then fit the remaining antineutrino excess to obtain a data-driven antineutrino 2p2h model uncertainty. The primary effect of varying the size of this contribution is to shift the overall level of the cross section. The normalization procedure removes most of the effect and the remaining uncertainty is less than 1.5% (2%) on the cross section (flux).",

The dominant systematic uncertainties on the shape for both the neutrino and antineutrino fluxes arise from limited knowledge of muon and hadron energy scales. This uncertainty peaks at low energies and has a nontrivial energy dependence that is due to the combined effects from sub-components having different precisions, as well as to the flux shape itself. The FSI uncertainty gives an effect that is also important, 3.5%, and nearly constant with energy. For antineutrinos, the statistical precision is poorer and is comparable to the systematic precision over most of the energy range. The statistical error in the data-based cross normalization factor \u03b1(\u03bd 0 ) (Table II), dominates the statistical precision below 12 GeV and is responsible for the detailed shape features in the uncertainty band 2 .",

The data (red points), extracted using GENIE-Hybrid for model corrections, favor a lower total cross section in the region 2-9 GeV, where data lie below the curves (by up to \u223c2\u03c3) for neutrinos. Antineutrino data also favor a lower cross section in the same region, but agree with models within the precison of the data, which have larger statistical uncertainties. For comparison, we also extract results using Eqs. (10) and (11) and NuWro (squares) to compute explicit model correction terms 4 . We omit error bars from NuWro-based points, which use the same raw binned data, and therefore have the same (correlated) statistical and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The shaded band shows the size of the estimated model systematic uncertainty (computed from the GENIE-Hybrid model) which spans the differences between the extracted cross section values. The NuWro model has a different treatment of the low-\u03bd region than GENIE, including a different axial mass parameter (M A = 1.2 GeV), a transverse enhancement model (TEM) [32]) to account for the meson exchange current (MEC) scattering contribution, and a dualitybased treatment in the resonance region [33]. The two sets of extracted cross sections show significant differences at low energies that reflect different modeling of the kinematic acceptance correction (A KIN CC ), which is larger for E \u03bd < 7 GeV. QE and MEC components, which dominate the lowest energy bin, have a harder muon spectrum resulting in better acceptance in the NuWro model. GENIE kinematic acceptance is better in the 3-7 GeV energy range for the resonance and deep inelastic scattering (DIS) components, which become dominant above 3 GeV. At high energies, the normalization method removes the effect of correction differences between the two models for the neutrino data points. For antineutrinos, the GENIE-Hybrid results are systematically above those for the NuWro model by a few percent at high energies.",

Measured points are extracted using GENIE-Hybrid (circles) and NuWro (squares) for model corrections. The measured R CC lies above the model predictions at low energies and favors a flatter extrapolation into that region than do the models, which fall off below 5 GeV. The NuWro results are systematically below the GENIE-Hybrid results by a few percent, tracking the differences seen in the antineutrino cross section level in the numerator (discussed above). The differences between GENIE-Hybrid-based and NuWro-based R CC measurements at lower energies are less significant than differences seen in the cross sections from the two models. The shaded band, which spans the NuWro versus GENIE-Hybrid point differences, shows the size of the estimated systematic uncertainty from model sources. Our result is in good agreement with the recent measurement from MI-NOS on an iron target in the region where they overlap (E \u03bd > 6 GeV). This measurement is the only precise determination of R CC in the E \u03bd < 6 GeV region. It spans neutrino energies from 2 to 22 GeV, a range which is highly relevant to ongoing and future oscillation experiments.",

Our measurement, with precision in the range of 5.0-7.5%, represents an improvement by nearly a factor of four over the previous measurements in this region [7]. We measure neutrino and antineutrino cross sections that extend the reach for antineutrino data to low energies and are among the most precise in the few GeV energy range. Two leading neutrino generators, GENIE and NuWro, both overestimate the measured inclusive CC cross sections at the level of 4-10% as energy decreases from 9 GeV to 2 GeV. We also present measured total and low-\u03bd fiducial rates that can be used to obtain the cross sections and their ratio with other models. In the near future, this will allow our data to be used with new models that will have improved treatments of nuclear effects and low energy scattering processes.",
