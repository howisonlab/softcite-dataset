This paper presents a study of several event shape variables calculated using jet four momenta in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and uses data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . After correcting for detector effects, the resulting distributions are compared with several theoretical predictions. The agreement generally improves as the energy, represented by the average transverse momentum of the two leading jets, increases.",

The experiments at the CERN LHC have studied production of hadronic jets by measuring differential crosssections, ratios of numbers of jets, angular distributions, etc., to deepen the understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the production of quarks and gluons with large transverse momentum (p T ) is well described by calculations based on perturbative QCD, the hadronization process probes energy scales where perturbative calculations are not applicable. Instead, phenomenological models inspired by QCD are used to predict the experimental results.",

These variables are safe from collinear and infrared divergences and have reduced experimental uncertainties [1]. Some distributions of ESVs are sensitive to the details of the hadronization process [2][3][4], so they can be used to tune parameters of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, determine the strong coupling \u03b1 S [5][6][7], and to search for new physics phenomena [8][9][10].",

ESVs have also been studied in electron-proton collisions at the DESY HERA collider [16] and in proton-antiproton collisions at the FNAL Tevatron collider [17], where they were compared with next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations and with various tunes of the PYTHIA6 event generator [18]. At the CERN LHC collider studies by the ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS Collaborations have exploited proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV to evaluate ESVs [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. This paper reports a measurement of ESVs by the CMS Collaboration using hadronic jets in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity (L int ) of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The following variables are studied: the complement of transverse thrust, total jet broadening, total jet mass, and total transverse jet mass. The theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of these ESVs can be reduced by careful choice of the quantity used to classify the energy scale of the events. Following ref. [4], we use H T,2 = (p T,jet1 + p T,jet2 )/2, where p T,jet1 and p T,jet2 refer to the transverse momenta of the highest and second highest p T jets.The measured distributions are corrected for detector effects and compared with the predictions of QCD models implemented in the pythia8 [27],",

The solenoid volume holds a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Steel and quartz-fibre Cherenkov hadron forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors to the region 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in \u03b7 and 0.087 radians in azimuthal angle (\u03c6). For |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5\u00d75 ECAL crystals arrays in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of \u03b7, the size in \u03b7 of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. CMS uses a two stage online trigger to select events for offline analysis. In the first stage, a hardware-based level-1 (L1) trigger uses information from calorimeter and muon subsystems and selects event at a rate of about 100 kHz. In the second stage, a software-based high-level trigger (HLT), running on computer farms, uses full event information and reduces the event rate to about 1 KHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in ref. [30].",

Measurement of jet energy is affected by contamination from additional pp interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup), as well as by the nonuniform and nonlinear response of the CMS calorimeters. The technique of charged-hadron subtraction [31] is used to reduce the contribution of particles that originate from pileup interactions to the jet energy measurement. The jet four-momentum is corrected for the difference observed in simulation between jets built from reconstructed particles and generator-level particles. The jet mass and direction are kept constant for the corrections, which are functions of the \u03b7 and p T of the jet, as well as the energy density and jet area quantities defined in ref. [34]. The latter are used to correct the energy offset introduced by the pileup interactions. The energy of the jets is further corrected using dijet, Z+jet, and \u03b3+jet events, where the p T -balance of the event is exploited.

The pythia8 and herwig++ event generators use leading order 2\u21922 matrix element (ME) calculations and parton shower (PS) for generation of multijet topologies. The pythia8 event generator uses a p T -ordered PS, and the underlying event description is based on the multiple parton interaction (MPI) model. Events are generated with two pythia8 tunes: CUETP8M1 [36] and Monash [37]. Minimum bias data collected by the CMS experiment were used to derive the pythia8 CUETP8M1 tune, which is based on the Monash tune. The MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator uses ME calculations to generate hard-scattering events with two to four partons and pythia8 CUETP8M1 for subsequent fragmentation and hadronization. The MLM [38] matching procedure is used to avoid double counting of jets between the ME calculation and the PS description. The herwig++ generator uses an angular-ordered PS. For simulated events, particle-level jets are obtained by applying the anti-k T clustering algorithm to all generated stable particles, excluding neutrinos, with R = 0.4.

To estimate the effect of each source, the four-momentum of each jet is scaled up and down by the corresponding uncertainty, the ESV is calculated, and the response matrix obtained with the nominal JES is used to unfold the distributions obtained with the nominal, scaled up, and scaled down JES values. For each bin of the unfolded distribution, the larger of the differences between the nominal, and the varied ones is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties due to different sources are then added in quadrature. For most bins in the distribution of an ESV, the uncertainty is 4-6%. However, it reaches about 12% for the highest and lowest bins of \u03c1 Tot , lowest bins of \u03c1 T Tot , and about 8% for the highest bins of B Tot . Typically JES is the largest source of systematic uncertainty in the ESVs.",

Similar exercises are carried out for the Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo sample using pythia8 CUETP8M1 and herwig++ response matrices, and for the herwig++ sample using pythia8 CUETP8M1 and Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo response matrices. Out of these six differences for each bin, the largest is taken as the systematic uncertainty. In the closure tests of the individual response matrices, if, for a particular bin, the difference in the unfolded and generated values is larger than the uncertainty already assigned, the larger one is taken as the uncertainty due to the unfolding for that bin. The bias inherent in the D'Agostini method is estimated by using different generators. The difference in the unfolded results is included as an unfolding uncertainty.

The effect of disabling the FSR is small compared to the ISR, and the effect of MPI is even smaller.
