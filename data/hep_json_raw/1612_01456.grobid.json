These algorithms were used for all ATLAS results with electrons in the final state that are based on the 2012 pp collision data produced by the LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The efficiency of these algorithms, together with the charge misidentification rate, is measured in data and evaluated in simulated samples using electrons from Z \u2192 ee, Z \u2192 ee\u03b3 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee decays. For these efficiency measurements, the full recorded data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , is used. Based on a new reconstruction algorithm used in 2012, the electron reconstruction efficiency is 97% for electrons with E T = 15 GeV and 99% at E T = 50 GeV. Combining this with the efficiency of additional selection criteria to reject electrons from background processes or misidentified hadrons, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify electrons at the ATLAS experiment varies from 65 to 95%, depending on the transverse momentum of the electron and background rejection.",

The identification criteria rely on the shapes of EM showers in the calorimeter as well as on tracking quantities and the quality of the matching of the tracks to the clustered energy deposits in the calorimeter.

It yields a better estimate of the electron track parameters, especially those in the transverse plane, by accounting for non-linear bremsstrahlung effects. TRT-only tracks and the very rare tracks (about 0.01%) that fail the GSF fit keep the parameters from the Global \u03c7 2 Track Fit. These tracks are then used to perform the final track-cluster matching to build electron candidates and also to provide information for particle identification.",

Due to the higher energy density per event, the shower shapes, even of isolated electrons, tend to look more background-like. In order to cope with this, requirements were loosened on the variables most sensitive to pile-up (R Had(1) and R \u03b7 ) and tightened on others to keep the performance (efficiency/background rejection) roughly constant as a function of the number of reconstructed pri-mary vertices.

For these electrons, Multilepton has a similar efficiency to the Loose selection, but provides a better background rejection.

Therefore, for each identification selection a dedicated set of trigger efficiency measurements is performed. Additional selection criteria are often imposed in analyses of collision data, for example on the isolation of electrons (introduced in Sect. 4.3). Neither trigger nor isolation efficiency measurements are covered here. The determination of identification and reconstruction is described in Sects. 7 and 10.

The normalization is done in the same ranges as in the denominator. The same-sign distribution is used as reference because it has less signal contamination than the opposite-sign distribution, an effect that is more important in the numerator.

Figure 5 shows the same for the Z \u2192 ee\u03b3 invariant-mass distribution. In order to assess systematic uncertainties, efficiency measurements based on the following variations of the analysis are considered. The mass window is changed from 15 to 10 and 20 GeV around the Z mass, the tag electron requirement is varied by applying a requirement on the calorimetric isolation variable and, in the Z \u2192 ee case, by loosening the identification requirement to Medium.

For this, the invariant-mass distribution of the two electron candidates is fitted with the sum of three contributions: J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S) and background, typically in the range of 1.8 GeV < m ee < 4.6 GeV.

For the lowest (7-10 GeV) as well as for the highest (above 80 GeV) E T bin, a significant and somewhat discontinuous increase in the identification efficiency is observed. This is explained by the fact that at very low and very high E T some requirements are relaxed. For the high E T bin the E/ p requirement is removed, because the measurement of the electron's track momentum is less precise for highp T tracks and can therefore not safely be used to distinguish electrons from backgrounds. It was checked that the data-to-MC correction factor measured for electrons above 80 GeV is applicable to electrons even at E T greater than 400 GeV using the Z iso method. Within the large statistical uncertainties, data-to-MC correction factors binned in E T for the high-E T region were found to agree with the combined data-to-MC correction factor above 80 GeV that is presented in this paper. The lowest E T bin (7-10 GeV) was tuned separately from the other bins, choosing the signal efficiency to be a few percentage points higher. This leads to higher background contamination.",

Another, larger drop in efficiency is observed for 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, where the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters is situated. At high |\u03b7| the efficiencies are lower due to the larger amount of material in front of the endcap calorimeters. Figures 13 and 14 show the identification efficiencies when integrated over E T or \u03b7, and as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices. These figures depict in their lower panels the data-to-MC correction factors. As can be seen, the correction factors are close to one, with cutbased selections showing better data-MC agreement than the LH. Only for low E T or high values of \u03b7, corrections reaching 10% have to be applied for the more stringent selection criteria. The combined statistical and systematic uncertainties in the data-to-MC correction factors range from 0.5 to 10%, with the highest uncertainties found at low E T , and in the transition region of the calorimeter, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52.

[13], the difference between identification efficiencies in data and MC simulation can be traced back to differences in the distribution of the variables used in the identification, particularly the shower shape variables and the TRT high-threshold hit ratio F HT , the latter being defined only for |\u03b7| < 2. The distributions of the lateral shower shapes are not well modelled by the GEANT4-based simulation of the detector: in comparison to predictions of the MC simulation, most shower shapes in data are wider and centred at values closer to the background distributions. These effects lead to higher efficiencies in MC simulation. F HT , on the other hand, is underestimated in the simulation for |\u03b7| > 1, leading to higher efficiencies in data than in the simulation. These two effects cancel each other, as can be seen in Fig. 13, where the data and MC efficiency values of the cut-based Tight selection are quite close to each other for 1 < |\u03b7| < 2. Figures 13 and 14 show that the data has a more significant dependence on pile-up than predicted by simulation. For the cut-based Multilepton and Loose selections, the data-to-MC ratio is almost constant as a function of the number of primary vertices, while it decreases for the cut-based Medium and Tight selections as well as the LH selections by about 2% from 1 to 30 primary vertices. This effect is primarily caused by the mismodelling in MC simulation of the R Had(1) , w stot and F HT variables. The F HT variable is sensitive to the pile-up conditions due to higher occupancies in events with many vertices, which can lead to hit overlaps in the TRT straws increasing the chance of passing the high threshold.",

However, the description of the MC simulation has several limitations: misidentification efficiencies depend on the tails of the distributions of many discriminating variables, which are typically more susceptible to mismodelling than the core of the distribution. Furthermore, a small deviation in shape and Z decays are removed at particle level. Furthermore, the sample is required to pass a set of electron and photon triggers without identification criteria, to allow better comparison with data-driven measurements. The composition of the sample is categorized according to MC simulation information: non-isolated electrons from heavy-flavour decays, background electrons from photon conversions and Dalitz decays, and hadrons. The background efficiency for each category is also quoted. The efficiency is always quoted with respect to reconstructed electron candidates passing the track quality requirement. For completeness, the isolated electron efficiency for Z \u2192 ee decays, measured from data, is also given.  21% is assigned to the subtraction of signal events using the simulation; this uncertainty is dominated by the mismodelling of the missing transverse momentum can lead to a large data-to-MC efficiency correction factor due to the low fraction of candidates in the tails. A data-driven estimate of the background efficiency is therefore essential. In this section, the ratio of background efficiencies from cutbased and LH menus is determined using data. An inclusive background sample is selected by a set of electron and photon triggers with different E T thresholds and no identification requirement. To prevent contamination from isolated electrons from W and Z decays, the reconstructed electron candidate (matched to the trigger electron) is rejected if it forms a pair with an invariant mass of 40-140 GeV with an electron candidate passing the Medium requirement. Likewise, the electron candidate is also rejected if there is significant missing transverse momentum in the event (E miss T > 25 GeV 11 ), or if the transverse mass calculated using E miss T is compatible with W -boson production (m T > 40 GeV). In order to remove the residual true electron contamination, these kinematic requirements are furthermore applied to simulated Z \u2192 ee and W \u2192 e\u03bd samples; the surviving events are scaled to the corresponding integrated luminosity and subtracted from the data yields before the background efficiency calculation.",

The measurement of the efficiency to detect an energy cluster in the EM calorimeter using the sliding-window algorithm is very challenging in data and not performed here. In MC simulation, it is found to be above 99% for E T > 15 GeV as discussed in Sect. 3. EM clusters form the starting point of the reconstruction efficiency measurement. The reconstruction efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons reconstructed as a cluster matched to a track satisfying the track quality criteria (numerator) to the number of clusters with or without a matching track (denominator). This reconstruction efficiency is measured using a tag-and-probe analysis which is very similar to the Z mass method introduced in Sect. 7. In comparison to the measurement of the identification efficiency, the probe definition is relaxed to include all EM clusters. The background estimation is adapted to include the contribution of EM clusters with no associated track.

However, for the denominator (all reconstructed EM clusters) an additional contribution from photon candidates must be determined separately. The total background at the denominator level is the sum of two contributions: background to electrons reconstructed as a cluster with and without an associated track. The background estimation for these two contributions is explained below.  Fig. 18 Estimate of the background to the selected EM clusters with no associated track for 15 GeV < E T < 20 GeV and 1.52 < \u03b7 < 2.01. A polynomial fit (shown by a dashed dark grey line) is carried out in the sideband region (indicated by dashed light grey boxes) of the invariantmass distribution of data events from which genuine electrons have been subtracted using MC simulation (the data are shown by filled squares before the subtraction of the prediction of the MC simulation and by open circles afterwards). In the signal region, defined as the events with an invariant mass of 80 GeV to 100 GeV, the fit result is used to obtain a data-driven estimate, which is compared to the data minus the prediction of the MC simulation. Only statistical uncertainties are shown for the data minus the MC prediction; the systematic uncertainty in the scaling of the MC simulation and description of the MC simulation of the inefficiency to match an electron with a track is 10-20% photons. In order to estimate the photon background, which, unlike the signal electrons, has a smoothly falling invariantmass shape, a third-order polynomial is fitted to the invariantmass distribution of the selected electron-photon pairs (corresponding to the tag and the probe electron candidates). The fit is carried out using the two sideband regions above and below the Z mass peak, as illustrated in Fig. 18. Residual signal electron contamination in the background-dominated sideband regions is subtracted using MC simulation before the fit. Systematic uncertainties in the scaling of the MC simulation and description of the MC simulation of the inefficiency to match an electron with a track are 10-20% and are not shown in Fig. 18. These uncertainties explain the small difference in the signal region between the data minus the MC prediction and the polynomial fit to the sidebands. The prediction of the MC simulation enters only in the subtraction of the very small residual signal in the sideband regions used to perform the polynomial fit. The resulting uncertainty in the measured reconstruction efficiency is negligible.",

Fig. 19 Invariant-mass distributions of the tag-and-probe pairs for probe EM clusters with 1.52 < \u03b7 < 1.81 and 15 GeV< E T < 20 GeV (left) or 40 GeV< E T < 45 GeV (right), before (top) and after (bottom) applying the reconstruction criteria. The data (black dots with error bars) at the all probes level is composed of two components: clusters with no matching track (dark grey histogram with error bars) and clusters with a matching track. The background is evaluated separately for these two components. A third-order polynomial (grey dashed line spanning the region from 70 GeV to 110 GeV) depicts the estimated photon background from a fit performed in the sideband regions as explained in Sect. 10.1.2 and shown in Fig. 18. A background template normalized in this case to the high-mass tail (magenta markers) is used to estimate the background with a matching track. This background template is obtained by requiring some of the identification criteria not to be satisfied. Additionally, probes must pass or fail the track quality selection requirements depending on whether the background to the electrons passing or failing the reconstruction requirements is determined (see Sect. 10.1.2). The shown magenta distribution is the sum of both components. For illustration only, the signal prediction of the MC simulation (blue dashed line) is also displayed. The sum of the normalized background template and the signal prediction of the MC simulation (red line, shown for comparison but not used in the measurement) agrees well with the data points the reconstruction efficiencies measured in the 2011 and 2012 data. The new track fitting algorithm improves the overall electron reconstruction efficiency by \u223c5%. Most of this improvement is in the low-E T range, where the electron reconstruction efficiency increases by more than \u223c7%. This constitutes a significant gain for important measurements such as the determination of Higgs boson properties in the channel H \u2192 Z Z * \u2192 4 [34].",

To compensate for the loss in rejection power, new selection criteria were introduced and requirements on variables less sensitive to pile-up were tightened. Additionally, new identification selections were developed: the cut-based Multilepton selection, optimized for low-energy electrons, as well as an identification based on the likelihood (LH) approach. Using the LH identification selections, the background rejection is significantly improved while maintaining the same signal efficiency as that of the cut-based selections. The identification efficiency has a strong dependence on E T and, for the tighter criteria, on \u03b7. Calculated with respect to reconstructed electrons satisfying quality criteria for their tracks, it averages between 96% (cut-based Loose) and 78% (Very Tight LH) for electrons with E T > 15 GeV. The measured pile-up dependence is below 4% for 1-30 reconstructed primary collision vertices per bunch crossing for all sets of selection criteria. Some differences between the behaviour in data and MC simulation are observed, but understood. The total uncertainties in the identification efficiency measurements are 5-6% (1-2%) for electrons below (above) E T = 25 GeV. Charge misidentification of electrons in the probed E T range is mostly caused by the emission of bremsstrahlung. The charge misidentification depends strongly on the applied selection criteria as well as on the \u03b7 of the electron. For representative selections the probability is at sub-percent level for |\u03b7| < 1 and can be as high as 10% for |\u03b7| \u223c 2.5.",
