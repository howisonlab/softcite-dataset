The longitudinal polarization of \u039b hyperons has been measured in e + e \u2212 annihilation and lepton-nucleon deep inelastic scattering (DIS) with polarized beams and/or targets [1]. These studies can provide access to polarized fragmentation functions and the spin content of the \u039b. Here we report our measurement on longitudinal spin transfer (D LL ) from the proton beam to \u039b(\u039b) produced in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s=200 GeV [2],",

Within the factorization framework, the production cross sections are described in terms of calculable partonic cross sections and nonperturbative parton distribution and fragmentation functions. The production cross section has been measured for transverse momenta, p T , up to about 5 GeV/c and is well described by perturbative QCD evaluations [3]. The spin transfer D LL is thus expected to be sensitive to polarized fragmentation function and helicity distribution function of nucleon, as reflected in different model predictions of D LL at RHIC [4,5,6,7]. The spin transfer D LL in Eq. (1) is equal to the polarization of \u039b (\u039b) hyperons P \u039b(\u039b) , if the proton beam is fully polarized.

The proton polarization was measured for each beam and each beam fill using Coulomb-Nuclear Interference (CNI) proton-carbon polarimeters [10]. Different beam spin configurations were used for successive beam bunches and the pattern was changed between beam fills. The data were sorted by beam spin configuration. The analyzed data sample includes three different triggers. One is the minimum bias (MB) trigger sample, defined by a coincidence signal from Beam-Beam Counters (BBC) on both sides of STAR interaction region. The other data samples were recorded with the MB trigger condition and with two additional trigger conditions: a high-tower (HT) and a jet-patch (JP). The HT trigger condition required the proton collision signal in BBC coincidence with a transverse energy deposit E T > 2.6 GeV in at least one Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) tower, covering \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 in pseudorapidity \u03b7 and azimuthal angle \u03c6.

Charged particle tracks in the 0.5 T magnetic field were measured with the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), covering 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 and |\u03b7| < 1.3. The charge tracks after particle identification from specific energy loss dE/dx in TPC were paired to form a \u039b(\u039b) candidate and topological selections were applied to reduce background [2,3]. The selections included criteria for the distance of closest approach between the paired tracks and the distance between the point of closest approach and the beam collision vertex, and demanded that the momentum sum of the track pair pointed at the collision vertex.

The detector acceptance in a cos \u03b8 * interval is taken as a constant and thus canceled.

In estimating the size of the systematic uncertainties, we have combined contributions from the uncertainties in decay parameter \u03b1 and in the measurements of the proton beam polarization and relative luminosity ratios, as well as uncertainty caused by the aforementioned backgrounds, overlapping events (pile-up), and, in the case of the JP sample, trigger bias studied with Monte Carlo simulation [2]. From Fig. 3, the \u039b and\u039b results for D LL are consistent with each other. The data have p T up to 4 GeV/c, where D LL = \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.13(stat) \u00b1 0.04(syst) for the \u039b and D LL = \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.08(stat) \u00b1 0.03(syst) for the\u039b at \u03b7 = 0.5. For reference, the model predictions of Refs. [4,7], evaluated at \u03b7 = \u00b10.5 and p T = 4 GeV/c, are shown as horizontal lines. The expectations of Ref. [4] hold for \u039b and\u039b combined and examine different polarized fragmentation scenarios, in which the strange (anti-)quark carries all or only part of the \u039b (\u039b) spin. The model in Ref. [7] separates \u039b from\u039b and otherwise distinguishes the direct production of the \u039b and \u039b from the (anti-)quark in the hard scattering and the indirect production via decay of heavier (anti-)hyperons. The evaluations are consistent with the present data and span a range of values   that, for positive \u03b7, is similar to the experimental uncertainties. The values for negative \u03b7 are expected to be negligible and thus less sensitive [4,7]. The current experimental uncertainties are statistics limited. In 2009, the data sample collected at STAR is about 10 times larger than the above analyzed data sample in 2005, and it is expected that the p T coverage of D LL measurement be doubled and have the ability to distinguish between different models of polarized fragmentation and parton distribution functions. In addition to longitudinal spin transfer, the transverse spin transfer of hyperons from the proton is also of particular interest in pp collisions, as it can provide access to the transverse spin content of the nucleon, i.e., the transversity distribution, which is chiral odd and still poorly known in experiment [14]. The transverse spin transfer D N N with respect to the production plane has been measured by the E704 experiment, and sizable spin transfer was observed at large x F (\u2261 2p z / \u221a s) region [15]. We have started looking at the transverse spin transfer of \u039b (\u039b) at mid-pseudorapidities with TPC at STAR. A Forward Hadron Calorimeter (FHC) may be installed behind the available Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) in the future at STAR, which may enable the reconstruction of \u039b hyperons at large x F region via the decay channel to n\u03c0 0 with \u03c0 0 detected by the FMS and n by the FHC. The transverse spin transfer measurements in the forward region are expected to be sizable and can provide valuable information for the transversity distribution of nucleon. In addition, the longitudinal spin transfer D LL of \u039b (\u039b) in the forward region can provide additional sensitivity to the strange quark polarization [16]. ",

The spin transfer is found to be D LL = \u22120.03\u00b10.13(stat)\u00b10.04(syst) for \u039b and D LL = \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.08(stat) \u00b1 0.03(syst) for\u039b hyperons with \u03b7 = 0.5 and p T = 3.7 GeV/c. The longitudinal spin transfer is sensitive to the polarized parton distribution and polarized fragmentation functions. The present results for \u039b and\u039b have uncertainties that are comparable to the variation between model expectations for the longitudinal spin transfer at RHIC. With the 2009 data, the p T coverage and the precision of D LL measurement is expected to be improved significantly. The possibility of measuring both longitudinal and transverse spin transfer for \u039b (\u039b) hyperons in the forward region at STAR is also discussed.",

Figure 1(b) shows the same invariant mass distribution versus cos \u03b8 * for the \u039b candidates. The number of \u039b candidates varies with cos \u03b8 * because of detector acceptance.
