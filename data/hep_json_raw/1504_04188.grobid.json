Data taken in stable beam conditions and with all ATLAS subsystems operational are used, resulting in an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The search is performed in the MCP mass range of 50-1000 GeV, for electric charges 2 |q| = ze, with the charge numbers z = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The observation of such particles possessing an electric charge above the elementary charge e would be a signature for physics beyond the Standard Model. Several theories predict such particles, including the almost-commutative model [1], the walking technicolor model [2], and the leftright symmetric model [3], which predicts a doubly charged Higgs boson. Any observation of the particles predicted by the first two models could have implications for the formation of composite dark matter: the doubly charged particles (or, in general, particles with an even charge |q| = 2ne) could explain many results of experimental searches for dark matter [4]. No such particles have been observed so far in cosmic ray [5] or collider searches, including several recent searches at the Tevatron [6] and the LHC [7][8][9].",

It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) comprising a silicon pixel detector (pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). The pixel detector typically provides one precise space-point measurement per track from each of its three layers. The SCT consists of four times two layers of silicon sensors arranged with small stereo angle, typically providing eight measurements per track. The TRT, covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.0, 3 is a straw-based tracking detector capable of particle identification via transition radiation and ionisation energy loss measurements [11]. A typical track crosses 32 straws. Discriminators are used to compare the signal from a straw with low and high thresholds (HT) using the TRT front-end electronics. The HT is designed to discriminate between energy depositions from transition radiation photons and the energy loss of minimum ionising particles. Roughly three times the energy deposition of a minimum ionising particle is needed for a HT hit. MCPs would produce a large number of HT hits along their trajectories due to their high level of ionisation.",

Particles reconstructed in the MS are not accounted for in the trigger E miss T calculation, thus they contribute to the missing transverse momentum value directly. Large missing transverse momentum can also be due to an asymmetry between the energy depositions in calorimeters of the two MCPs.

Several factors contribute to the efficiency dependence on mass and charge. For low masses, the minimum p T /z requirements are the main source of efficiency loss. At higher masses, the requirement to reach the MS with a \u03b2 which satisfies the trigger timing window is the primary reason for the reduction in efficiency. Also, high ionisation loss makes particles slow down: they may not fit the trigger timing window or may lose all their kinetic energy before reaching the MS. The charge dependence of the efficiency results from the higher ionisation loss and the higher effective p T selection, which are augmented by factors z 2 and z, respectively. For MCPs that do not reach the MS, the E miss T would be larger for heavier MCPs and therefore more likely to fire the E miss T trigger, although the probability for such events to satisfy all selection criteria is smaller since only one candidate of an MCP pair is reconstructed in the MS.",

In order to improve the description of the trigger simulation, parameterised corrections were applied. To assess the uncertainties, the parameters of these corrections were varied. The \u03b2 value of particles was varied between the true generated value and the one reconstructed in the MS from the known mass and measured momentum. 5 The time interval needed for a signal particle to reach the RPC trigger planes was varied by the root-mean-square width of the timing distribution for muons measured in the full Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc sample in data.

For example, the uncertainty on the amount of material in front of the MS, which is found to be about 1 % [26], propagates into an uncertainty on the selection efficiency due to the slowing down of particles, and its effect is covered by the effect of varying the p T requirement. The following variations of the nominal requirements are studied: p T value by \u00b13 % because of an uncertainty on the track p T measurements and the uncertainty on the amount of material; f HT value by \u00b125 % due to pile-up dependence, S(pixel dE/dx) by \u00b110 %, S(TRT dE/dx) by \u00b15 % and S(MDT dE/dx) by \u00b115 % because of the observed disagreement of the mean and root-meansquare width of these distributions in the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events in data and simulation, as well as of any potential mismodelling of these ionisation estimators. For all other variables the variations have no observable effect in any of the signal samples. The total systematic uncertainties on the efficiency arising from these variations range between 1 % and 17 %, where the larger uncertainty corresponds to lower-mass signal samples. This uncertainty is dominated by the effect of the p T requirement variation, which the lightest MCPs are most sensitive to.",

Thus, the trigger and selection efficiencies are the main sources of uncertainty. An additional statistical uncertainty to take into account the limited size of the Monte Carlo samples is added. The samples with a mass of 50 GeV and charge numbers z = 5, z = 6 were produced with a selection at the generator level requiring p T /z > 20 GeV in order to decrease this uncertainty.

Figure 8 shows the observed 95 % CL cross-section limits as a function of mass for the five different charges. At the lowest mass values the cross-section limit ranges from 7 fb for z = 2 to 1.4 pb for z = 6. The most stringent cross-section limits are obtained for masses of about 400 GeV and range from 0.4 to 1.6 fb. In addition, the theoretical cross-section is shown for the simplified Drell-Yan model. The uncertainty on the theoretical cross-section is due to the parton distribution functions choice and is estimated to be 5 %. For this model, the crosssection limits can be transformed into mass exclusion regions from 50 GeV up to limits of 660, 740, 780, 785, and 760 GeV for charge numbers z = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

Particles with electric charges from |q| = 2e to |q| = 6e penetrating the full ATLAS detector and producing anomalously high ionisation signals in multiple detector elements are searched for. Less than one background event is expected and no events are observed.
