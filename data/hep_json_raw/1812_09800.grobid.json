            "text": "Although the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) [1][2][3][4] has achieved great success in the past decades in explaining and predicting the spectrum of charmed-strange mesons (D s ), there still exist discrepancies between the the-oretical predictions and experimental measurements, especially for the P -wave excited states. The unexpectedly low masses of D * s0 (2317) \u2212 and D s1 (2460) \u2212 stimulated theoretical and experimental interest not only in them, but also in the other two P -wave charmed-strange states, D s1 (2536) \u2212 and D s2 (2573) \u2212 . The resonance parameters of the D s1 (2536) \u2212 and D * s2 (2573) \u2212 mesons need more experimentally independent measurements [5]. In particular, the latest result on the D * s2 (2573) \u2212 mass from LHCb [6,7] deviates from the other measurements [8][9][10] significantly, and therefore, the world average fit gives a bad quality \u03c7 2 /ndf = 17.1/4 [5], where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom. In addition, the quantum numbers spin and parity (J P ) of the D * s2 (2573) \u2212 meson have been determined to be J P = 2 + only recently with a partial wave analysis carried out by LHCb [11], and more confirmation is needed.",

            "text": "In recent years, measurements of the exclusive cross sections for e + e \u2212 annihilation into charmed or charmed-strange mesons above the open charm threshold have attracted great interest. First, the charmonium states above the open charm threshold (\u03c8 states) still lack of adequate experimental measurements and theoretical explanations. The latest parameter values of these \u03c8 resonances are given by BES [12] from a fit to the total cross section of hadron production in e + e \u2212 annihilation. However, model predictions for \u03c8 decays into twobody final states were used, hence the values of the resonance parameters remain model-dependent. Studies of the exclusive e + e \u2212 cross sections would help to measure the parameters of the \u03c8 states model-independently. Second, many additional Y states with J P = 1 \u2212\u2212 lying above the open charm threshold have been discovered recently [13][14][15][16][17]. Exclusive cross section measurements will provide important information in explaining these states. Measurements of e + e \u2212 cross sections for the D",

Up to now, only the DD * 2 (2460) final states in e + e \u2212 annihilation have been observed by Belle [32], others with higher excited charmed or charmed-strange mesons have not yet been observed. In addition, the cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 DD ( * ) \u03c0 have also been measured by CLEO [27] and BESIII [28][29][30][31]. However, a search for final states with strange flavor, e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + s D ( * )0 K \u2212 , has not been performed before. Using e + e \u2212 collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb \u22121 [33] collected at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 4.600 GeV with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPCII), we observe the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + s D * 0 K \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + s D 0 K \u2212 , which are found to be dominated by D + s D s1 (2536) \u2212 and D + s D * s2 (2573) \u2212 , respectively. For the observed D s1 (2536) \u2212 and D * s2 (2573) \u2212 mesons, we present the resonance parameters and determine the spin and parity of D * s2 (2573) \u2212 . In addition, the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + s D ( * )0 K \u2212 are searched for using the data samples taken at four (two) center-of-mass energies between 4.416 (4.527) and 4.575 GeV, and upper limits at 90% confidence level on the cross sections are determined.

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based multilayer drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with resistive plate counter muon identifier modules interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% over 4\u03c0 solid angle. The charged-particle momentum resolution at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the specific energy loss (dE/dx) resolution is 6% for electrons from Bhabha scattering. The EMC measures photon energies with a resolution of 2.5% (5%) at 1 GeV in the barrel (end cap) region. The time resolution of the TOF barrel part is 68 ps, while that of the end cap part is 110 ps.",

The simulation includes the beam energy spread and effects of initial state radiation (ISR) in the e + e \u2212 annihilations modeled with the generator KKMC [38]. The inclusive MC samples consist of the production of open charm processes, the ISR production of vector charmonium(-like) states, and the continuum processes incorporated in KKMC [38]. The known decay modes are model-led with EVTGEN [39] using branching fractions taken from the Particle Data Group [5], and the remaining unknown decays from the charmonium states with LUND-CHARM [40]. Final state radiation (FSR) from charged final state particles is simulated with the PHOTOS package [41]. The intermediate states in the D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay are considered in the simulation [42].

Hence, we assume that the D * s2 (2573) \u2212 meson can only have two possible J P assignments, 1 \u2212 or 2 + . Under these two hypotheses, the differential decay rates as a function of the helicity angle \u03b8 \u2032 of the K \u2212 in the rest frame of the D * s2 (2573) \u2212 , dN/d cos\u03b8 \u2032 , follow two very distinctive formulae of (1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 \u2032 ) for 1 \u2212 and cos 2 \u03b8 \u2032 (1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 \u2032 ) for 2 + . We can determine the true spin-parity from tests of the two hypotheses based on data.",
