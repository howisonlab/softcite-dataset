The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The events selected have an opposite-sign muon or electron pair and a high transverse momentum photon. No excess above background has been found in the threebody invariant mass range 120 < m \u03b3 < 150 GeV, and limits have been derived for the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction for the decay H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 , where the dilepton invariant mass is less than 20 GeV. For a Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV, a 95% confidence level (CL) exclusion observed (expected) limit is 6.7 (5.9 +2.8 \u22121.8 ) times the standard model prediction. Additionally, an upper limit at 95% CL on the branching fraction of H \u2192 (J/\u03c8)\u03b3 for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is set at 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

As illustrated in Fig. 1, this decay in SM has contributions from loopinduced H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 and H \u2192 Z\u03b3 diagrams (a, b, c), tree-level process H \u2192 with final-state radiation (d), and higher-order processes, known as box diagrams (e, f, g) [1][2][3][4]. Other contributions include H \u2192 V (qq)\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 , shown in Fig. 2, where V denotes a vector meson (J/\u03c8 or \u03d2 ) that decays to [5][6][7]. The Higgs boson branching fraction to \u03b3 is dominated by the H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 and H \u2192 Z\u03b3 modes, while the contribution from the box diagrams is negligible [1]. In the muon channel, when the dilepton invariant mass, m , is greater than 100 GeV, final-state radiation in H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc starts to dominate [8]. In the three-body decay, H \u2192 \u03b3 , it is possible to investigate non-SM couplings by examining the angular distributions, and forward-backward asymmetry variables reconstructed from the \u03b3 final state [8,9].",

The \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 topology is a clean final state with a mass resolution of about 1.6%, as measured from the simulated signal samples. The ee\u03b3 channel is challenging due to the low m that results in a pair of merged electron showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). Nevertheless, when the merged showers are reconstructed in the ECAL, a mass resolution of 1.8% is achieved. Important backgrounds include the irreducible contributions from the initial-and final-state photon radiation in Drell-Yan production, and Drell-Yan events with additional jets where a jet is misidentified as a photon.",

In the SM this decay occurs through two main processes: direct coupling of the Higgs boson to charm (Fig. 2a), and the usual t/W loop, where the radiated \u03b3 * converts to a cc in a resonant state (Fig. 2b). The two amplitudes interfere destructively and the second one dominates [6,7]. For the SM Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV, the branching fraction is predicted to be 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .

This approach allows us to maintain a high efficiency independent of the dimuon invariant mass and to reconstruct muons with p T as low as 4 GeV. Muons from \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc internal conversions are expected to be isolated from other particles. A cone of size R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 is constructed around the momentum direction of each muon candidate [21]. The relative isolation of the muon is quantified by summing the p T of all photons, charged and neutral hadrons within this cone, and then dividing by the muon p T . The resulting quantity, corrected for additional underlying event activity due to pileup events, is required to be less than 0.4 for the leading muon. The isolation requirement rejects misidentified leptons and background arising from hadronic jets. The R(\u03bc\u03bc) separation between the two muons is small due to their low invariant mass (as shown in Fig. 3) and high p T of the \u03b3 * in H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 decays. Hence, no isolation requirement is applied to the subleading muons as they are already within the isolation cone of the leading muons in most events. Dimuon identification and isolation efficiency of about 80% is obtained.",

Therefore, their energy deposits in the ECAL are merged into one supercluster giving rise to a unique signature. To identify these merged electrons, two tracks associated to the supercluster are required. A Gaussian sum filter (GSF) algorithm is used to reconstruct the electron tracks [22]. The supercluster energy must correspond to p T > 30 GeV and be located in the ECAL barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.44). The scalar sum p e 1 T + p e 2 T of the corresponding two GSF tracks must exceed 44 GeV. Both GSF tracks are required to have no more than one missing hit in the pixel detector in order to reduce the background from photons converting to e + e \u2212 in the detector material.

The uncertainty can be separated into the uncertainty resulting from theoretical predictions and from the uncertainty in detector reconstruction and selection efficiency. Theoretical uncertainties come from the effects of the PDF choice on signal cross section, the missing higher-order calculations (scale) [38][39][40][41][42], and the uncertainty in the prediction on the Higgs boson decay branching fraction [4,11]. The uncertainty due to the muon reconstruction efficiency, 11%, is obtained from data using J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events. It is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the data sample. In the electron channel, the corresponding uncertainty, 3.5%, is obtained from simulation. The 11% uncertainty estimated for the muon identification efficiency is sufficiently small and it has no impact on our result, thus no simulation study was attempted, although it could greatly reduce the uncertainty.",

Experimentally, the various contributions shown in Figs. 1 and 2 can be disentangled to some extent. Requirements on m and the transverse momentum (p T ) of the photon are used to separate H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 and H \u2192 Z\u03b3 . Events with finalstate radiation are removed by requiring the photon to be isolated from either of the leptons. Contributions from H \u2192 (J/\u03c8)\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 and other resonances are identified and rejected or selected based on the value of m .
