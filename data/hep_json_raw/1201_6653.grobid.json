A large sample of top quarks collected by the CDF and D0 experiments allows to perform precision measurements of their production which is predicted to occur within the standard model (SM) either in pairs via strong interactions or as single top events via electroweak interactions. Such measurements represent an important test of the theoretical calculations which predict the tt and single top production cross sections with a precision of 6% to 8% [1] and 5% [2], respectively. Precise measurements of top pair cross section (\u03c3 tt ) in different tt final states and single top production via different production mechanisms are highly desirable as they are sensitive to the non-SM particles that may appear in top quark production or decays.",

Two approaches are used to discriminate tt signal from the background. The first one exploits differences in kinematic properties of signal and W+jets background. It relies on selecting a number of discriminating variables, typically related to different features of the events, such as angular distributions of the objects or a e-mail: Elizaveta.Shabalina@cern.ch their energy, and building a discriminant from these variables using one of the multivariate techniques. The cross section is then extracted from a binned maximum likelihood fit to data.

Thus the requirement of at least one jet per event be identified as a b-jet improves significantly S /B and allows to extract tt cross section from a counting experiment. D0 performed tt cross section measurement with 5.3 fb \u22121 of data by selecting events with \u2265 2 jets and splitting them into subsamples according to the number of jets and b-tags [3]. In the background dominated subsamples, i.e., two jet events, three jet events with < 2 b-tags and events with at least four jets and no b-tags, Random Forest (RF) discriminant is built to separate signal from the background. In the signal dominated ones, with at least four jets and three jets with two b-tags, the b-tag counting is used. Cross section is extracted from the simultaneous fit to data of the RF discriminant and the number of b-tags distribution across different jet multiplicities constraining many systematic uncertainties which are included as nuisance parameters in the fit. The measured cross section yields \u03c3 tt = 7.78 +0.77 \u22120.64 (stat + syst + lumi) pb, achieving a relative precision below 10%. The latter is limited by the systematic uncertainties with the largest contribution from the determination of integrated luminosity (6.1%).",

Using this approach in the dataset of 4.6 fb \u22121 CDF collaboration measures cross section using two methods: by of these two measurements yields the most precise top quark cross section measurement to date of \u03c3 tt = 7.70 \u00b1 0.52 pb with a relative uncertainty of 7%.

The disadvantage of this channel is its low branching fraction which made \u03c3 tt measurement statistically limited until recently. The CDF collaboration uses 5.1 fb \u22121 of data to measure \u03c3 tt in the dilepton channel using 343 candidate events in the pretag sample and 137 events after b-jet identification requirement [5]. Both measurements are in good agreement with each other and yield \u03c3 tt = 7.40 \u00b1 0.58(stat) \u00b1 0.63(syst) \u00b1 0.45(lumi) pb for the pretag analysis and \u03c3 tt = 7.25 \u00b1 0.66(stat) \u00b1 0.47(syst) \u00b1 0.44(lumi) pb for the b-tagged one. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are comparable for both approaches. The b-tagged analysis has a smaller systematic uncertainty due to a significantly lower backgrounds which have relatively large uncertainties and achieves a precision below 13%. Figure 2 shows jet multiplicity spectrum in the pretag sample. The D0 collaboration uses a more complicated new technique to measure \u03c3 tt in 5.4 fb \u22121 of data [6]. In addition to events with at least two jets this analysis uses one-jet events in e\u00b5 channel and extracts \u03c3 tt from the likelihood fit to the distriminant based on the D0 NN b-tagging algorithm. The algorithm combines information about the impact parameters of the tracks and variables that characterize the properties of the reconstructed secondary vertices in a single discriminant. The cross section is measured by simultaneously fitting the distributions of the smallest of the two b-tagging NN output values of the two leading jets in the four channels with systematic uncertainties included in the fit. This approach allows to constrain the uncertainties and achieve the best precision in the dilepton channel ",

            "text": "Given that potential contributions from new physics scenarios can affect only one of the channels it is important to perform single top cross section measurements in sand t-channels separately. Using same data set as for the combined s + t measurement D0 collaboration performs model-independent measurement of t-channel single top production [13]. In this analysis, two-dimensional posterior probability density is constructed as a function of tand s-channel cross sections without constraint on the relative rate of these contributions. Posterior distribution is integrated over s-channel axis to obtain one dimentional posterior probability density used to extract t-channel cross section. The latter is measured to be \u03c3(t) = 2.90 \u00b1 0.59 pb. The observed (expected) significance of the result is 5.5 (4.6) standard deviations. Cross section in s-channel is obtained in a similar way by integrating over t-channel axis: \u03c3(s) = 0.98 \u00b1 0.63 pb.",

D0 experiment measures R simultaneously with the tt cross section using dilepton and \u2113 + jets events in 5.4 fb \u22121 of data [15]. In the \u2113 + jets channel, counting of b-tagged events in data and simulation is used to distunguish between different decay modes of tt pair.
