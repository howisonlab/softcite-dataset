The tools for describing the e + e \u2212 annihilation to hadrons process generally include the use of the KKMC generator [4], which includes initial and final state radiation, and the Pythia [5] program based on the Lund String model or Parton Shower model that hadronizes the final-state quarks. The KKMC-Pythia combination is not expected to correctly describe the processes with more than two vector mesons in the final state, as they correspond to higher order Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) 1  processes and are generally associated with multiple gluons. The experimental results provide more constraints on the higher-order QCD calculation.",

This experimental result has stimulated much theoretical interest. Various theoretical approaches, such as NRQCD factorization [7] and the light cone method [8], have been proposed to make corrections to the low ratio predicted by the non-relativistic calculation, which predicts a much lower value for the cross section [9]. The validity of the theoretical investigations can be tested over a wide kinematical range with double or triple quarkonia (ss, cc, bb) produced in e + e \u2212 annihilations. In particular, strangeonia ss are located in the region of transition between perturbative QCD and non-perturbative QCD. The e + e \u2212 annihilation to multiple ss states may provide an important experimental opportunity in the lowenergy region.",

Therefore, 4.0% is taken as the systematic uncertainty for four kaons. b. PID efficiency. PID is required for the kaons, and the uncertainty is estimated to be 1.0% per kaon [16]. Hence, 4.0% is taken as the systematic uncertainty of the PID efficiency for four kaons. d. Fit procedure. For the six data samples, the yields of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6\u03c9 and \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 events are obtained by a fit to the distribution of the mass recoiling against the reconstructed \u03c6\u03c6 system. The following two aspects are considered when evaluating the systematic uncertainty associated with the fit procedure. (1) Signal shape.-In the nominal fit, the signal shapes are described by the MC shape obtained from MC simulation. An alternative fit with the MC shape convoluted with a Gaussian function for the \u03c9/\u03c6 signal shape is performed, where the parameters of the Gaussian function are free. The resulting difference in the yield with respect to the nominal fit is considered as the systematic uncertainty from the signal shape. This uncertainty is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty. (2) Background shape.-In the nominal fit, the background shape is described with a third-order Chebyshev polynomial function. The fit with a fourth-order Chebyshev polynomial function for the background shape is performed to estimate the uncertainty due to the background parametrization. e. Peaking backgrounds. The uncertainty is taken as 1.0%, as described in Sec. 4.",
