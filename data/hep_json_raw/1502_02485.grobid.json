Events with hadronic jets and one or two oppositely charged leptons are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. In order to separate the signal from the larger tt + jets background, this analysis uses a matrix element method that assigns a probability density value to each reconstructed event under signal or background hypotheses. The ratio between the two values is used in a maximum likelihood fit to extract the signal yield. The results are presented in terms of the measured signal strength modifier, \u03bc, relative to the standard model prediction for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The observed (expected) exclusion limit at a 95 % confidence level is \u03bc < 4.2 (3.3), corresponding to a best fit value\u03bc = 1.2 +1.6   \u22121.5 .",

            "text": "Following the discovery of a new boson with mass around 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [1][2][3] at the CERN LHC, the measurement of its properties has become an important task in particle physics. The precise determination of its quantum numbers and couplings to gauge bosons and fermions will answer the question whether the newly discovered particle is the Higgs boson (H) predicted by the standard model (SM) of particle physics, i.e. the quantum of the field responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Conversely, any deviation from SM predictions will represent evidence of physics beyond our present knowledge, thus opening new horizons in highenergy physics. While the measurements performed with the data collected so far indicate overall consistency with the SM e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch expectations [3,[10][11][12][13], it is necessary to continue improving on the measurement of all possible observables.",

            "text": "In the SM, the Higgs boson couples to fermions via Yukawa interactions with strength proportional to the fermion mass. Direct measurements of decays into bottom quarks and \u03c4 leptons have provided the first evidence that the 125 GeV Higgs boson couples to down-type fermions with SM-like strength [14]. Evidence of a direct coupling to uptype fermions, in particular to top quarks, is still lacking. Indirect constraints on the top-quark Yukawa coupling can be inferred from measuring either the production or the decay of Higgs bosons through effective couplings generated by top-quark loops. Current measurements of the Higgs boson cross section via gluon fusion and of its branching fraction to photons are consistent with the SM expectation for the top-quark Yukawa coupling [3,[10][11][12]. Since these effective couplings occur at the loop level, they can be affected by beyond-standard model (BSM) particles. In order to disentangle the top-quark Yukawa coupling from a possible BSM contribution, a direct measurement of the former is required. This can be achieved by measuring observables that probe the top-quark Yukawa interaction with the Higgs boson already at the tree-level. The production cross section of the Higgs boson in association with a top-quark pair (ttH) provides an example of such an observable. A sample of tree-level Feynman diagrams contributing to the partonic processes qq, gg \u2192 ttH is shown in Fig. 1 (left and centre). The inclusive next-to-leading-order (NLO) ttH cross section is about 130 fb in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV for a Higgs boson mass (m H ) of 125 GeV [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24], which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the cross section for Higgs boson production via gluon fusion [23,24].",

The first combination of ttH searches in different final states has been published by the CMS Collaboration based on the full data set collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [28]. Assuming SM branching fractions, the results of that analysis set a 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limit on the ttH signal strength at 4.5 times the SM value, while an upper limit of 1.7 times the SM is expected from the background-only hypothesis.

            "text": "The results of a search for ttH production in the decay channel H \u2192 bb are presented in this paper based on pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector [29] and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 . The analysis described here differs from that of Ref. [28] in the way events are categorized and in its use of an analytical matrix element method (MEM) [30,31] for improving the separation of signal from background. Within the MEM technique, each reconstructed event is assigned a probability density value based on the theoretical differential cross section \u03c3 \u22121 d\u03c3/dy, where y denotes the fourmomenta of the reconstructed particles. Particle-level quantities that are either unknown (e.g. neutrino momenta, jetparton associations) or poorly measured (e.g. quark energies) are marginalised by integration. The ratio between the probability density values for signal and background provides a discriminating variable suitable for testing the compatibility of an event with either of the two hypotheses [32].",

A phenomenological feasibility study for a ttH measurement in the H \u2192 bb decay channel at the LHC using the MEM has been pioneered in Ref. [35] based on the MadWeight package [36] for automatised matrix-element calculations. The present paper makes use of an independent implementation of the MEM, specifically optimized for the final state of interest. This is the first time that the MEM is applied to a search for ttH events. The final states typical of ttH events with H \u2192 bb, that are characterised by huge combinatorial background, the presence of nonreconstructed particles, and small signal-tobackground ratios, provide an ideal case for the deployment of the MEM. The analysis strategy is designed to maximise the separation between ttH and tt + bb background events, in order to reduce the systematic uncertainty on the signal extraction related to the modelling of this challenging background.",

Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables can be found in Ref. [29].",

The main background in the analysis stems from tt + jet production. This process has been simulated with the MadGraph 5.1.3 [39] tree-level matrix element generator matched to pythia for the parton shower description, and normalised to the inclusive next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) cross section with soft-gluon resummation at nextto-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy [40]. The tt + jets sample has been generated in a five-flavour scheme with treelevel diagrams for two top quarks plus up to three extra partons, including both charm and bottom quarks. An additional correction factor to the tt + jets samples is applied to account for the differences observed in the top-quark p T spectrum when comparing the MadGraph simulation with data [41]. The interference between the ttH, H \u2192 bb diagrams and the tt + bb background diagrams is negligible and is not considered in the MC simulation. Minor backgrounds come from the Drell-Yan production of an electroweak boson with additional jets (W + jets, Z + jets), and from the production of a top-quark pair in association with a W \u00b1 , Z boson (ttW, ttZ). These processes have been generated by MadGraph matched to the pythia parton shower description. The Drell-Yan processes have been normalised to the NNLO inclusive cross section from fewz 3.1 [42], while the NLO calculations from Refs. [43,44] are used to normalise the ttW and ttZ samples, respectively. Single top quark production is modelled with the NLO generator powheg 1.0 [45][46][47][48][49][50] combined with pythia. Electroweak diboson processes (WW, WZ, and ZZ) are simulated by using the pythia generator normalised to the NLO cross section calculated with mcfm 6.6 [51]. Processes that involve top quarks have been generated with a topquark mass of 172.5 GeV. Samples generated at LO use the CTEQ6L1 parton distribution function (PDF) set [52], while samples generated with NLO programs use the CTEQ6.6M PDF set [53].",

The CSV algorithm assigns to each jet a continuous value that can be used as a jet flavour discriminator. Large values of the discriminator correspond preferentially to b-quark jets, so that working points of increasing purity can be defined by requiring higher values of the CSV discriminator. For example, the CSV medium working point (CSVM) is defined in such a way as to provide an efficiency of about 70 % (20 %) to tag jets originating from a bottom (charm) quark, and of approximately 2 % for jets originating from light quarks or gluons. Scale factors are applied to the simulation to match the distribution of the CSV discriminator measured with a tag-and-probe technique [63] in data control regions.

The selection criteria are therefore optimised to accept events compatible with a ttH signal where H \u2192 bb and at least one of the top quarks decays to a bottom quark, a charged lepton, and a neutrino. Events are divided into two exclusive channels depending on the number of charged leptons (electrons or muons), which can be either one or two. Top quark decays in final states with tau leptons are not directly searched for, although they can still satisfy the event selection criteria when the tau lepton decays to an electron or muon, plus neutrinos. Channels of different lepton multiplicities are analysed separately. The single-lepton (SL) channel requires one isolated muon with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1, or one isolated electron with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, excluding the 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.57 transition region between the ECAL barrel and endcap. Events are vetoed if additional electrons or muons with p T in excess of 20 GeV, the same |\u03b7| requirement, and passing some looser identification and isolation criteria are found. The dilepton (DL) channel collects events with a pair of oppositely charged leptons satisfying the selection criteria used to veto additional leptons in the SL channel. To reduce the contribution from Drell-Yan events in the same-flavour DL channel, the invariant mass of the lepton pair is required to be larger than 15 GeV and at least 8 GeV away from the Z boson mass. The optimisation of the selection criteria in terms of signal-to-background ratio requires a stringent demand on the number of jets. At least five (four) jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 are requested in the SL (DL) channel. A further event selection is required to reduce the tt + jets background, which at this stage exceeds the signal rate by more than three orders of magnitude. For this purpose, the CSV discriminator values are calculated for all jets in the event and collectively denoted by \u03be . For SL (DL) events with seven or more (five or more) jets, only the six (four) jets with the largest CSV discriminator value are considered. The likelihood to observe \u03be is then evaluated under the alternative hypotheses of tt plus two heavy-flavour jets (tt+hf) or tt plus two light-flavour jets (tt+lf). For example, for SL events with six jets, and neglecting correlations among different jets in the same event, the likelihood under the tt + hf hypothesis is estimated as:",

For the sake of simplicity, the likelihood in Eq. 1is rigorous for W \u2192 ud(s) decays, whereas it is only approximate for W \u2192 cs(d) decays, since the CSV discriminator pdf for charm quarks differs with respect to f lf [62].

In the following, events are retained if F is larger than a threshold value F L ranging between 0.85 and 0.97, depending on the channel and jet multiplicity. The selected events are further classified as high-purity (low-purity) if F is larger (smaller) than a value F H , with F L < F H < 1.0. The lowpurity categories serve as control regions for tt + lf jets, providing constraints on several sources of systematic uncertainty. The high-purity categories are enriched in tt + hf events, and drive the sensitivity of the analysis. The thresholds F L and F H are optimised separately for each of the analysis categories defined in Sect. 6. The exact values are reported in Table 1.  After requiring a lower threshold on the selection variable F, the background is dominated by tt + jets, with minor contributions from the production of a single top quark plus jets, tt plus vector bosons, and W/Z + jets; the expected purity for a SM Higgs boson signal is only at the percent level. By construction, the selection criteria based on Eq. (2) enhance the tt+bb subprocess compared to the otherwise dominant tt+lf production. The tt + bb background has the same final state as the signal whenever the two b quarks are resolved as individual jets. Therefore, this background cannot be effectively reduced by means of the F discriminant. The cross section for tt + bb production with two resolved b-quark jets is larger than that of the signal by about one order of magnitude and is affected by sizable theoretical uncertainties [64], which The expected event yields with their uncertainties are obtained from a signal-plus-background fit as described in Sect. 8. In the last row of each table, the symbol S (B) denotes the signal (total background) yield hampers the possibility of extracting the signal via a counting experiment.

            "text": "As in other resonance searches, the invariant mass reconstructed from the H \u2192 bb decay provides a natural discriminating variable to separate the narrow Higgs boson dijet resonance from the continuum mass spectrum expected from the tt + jets background. However, in the presence of additional b quarks from the decay of the top quarks, an ambiguity in the Higgs boson reconstruction is introduced, leading to a combinatorial background. The distribution of the experimental mass estimator built from a randomly selected jet pair is much broader compared to the detector resolution, since wrongly chosen jet pairs are only mildly or not at all correlated with m H . Unless a selection rule is introduced to filter out the wrong combinations, the existence of such a combinatorial background results in a suppression of the statistical power of the mass estimator, which grows as the factorial of the jet multiplicity. Multivariate techniques that exploit the correlation between several observables in the same event are naturally suited to deal with signal extraction in such complex final states. In this paper, a likelihood technique based on the theoretical matrix elements for the ttH process and the tt + bb background is applied for signal extraction. This method utilises the kinematics and dynamics of the event, providing a powerful discriminant between the signal and background. The tt + bb matrix elements are considered as the prototype to model all background processes. This choice guarantees optimal separation between the signal and the tt + bb background, which is a desirable property given the large rate and theoretical uncertainty in the latter. The performance on the other tt + jets subprocesses might not be necessarily optimal, even though some separation power is still preserved; indeed, the tt + bb matrix elements describe these processes better than the signal matrix elements do, as it has been verified a posteriori with the simulation. More specifically, the shapes of the matrix element discriminant predicted by the simulation for the different tt + jets subprocesses are found to be similar to each other, with a slightly better separation power for the tt + bb background. The approximate degeneracy in shape between several processes can be ascribed to a smearing effect of the combinatorial background, as well as to the impact of the Higgs boson mass constraint on the calculation of the event likelihood under the signal hypothesis. The latter provides a similar discrimination against all tt + jets subprocesses. A slightly worse separation power is instead observed for minor backgrounds, such as single top quark or ttZ events, for which neither of the two matrix elements tested really applies. However, all of the background processes analysed are found to yield discriminant shapes that can be well distinguished from that for the signal. Also, it is found that most of the statistical power attained by this method in separating ttH, H \u2192 bb from tt + bb events relies on the different correlation and kinematic distributions of the two b-quark jets not associated with the top quark decays.",

For H = ttH, the factorisation scale \u03bc F entering the PDF is taken as half of the sum of twice the top-quark mass and the Higgs boson mass [20], while for H = tt + bb a dynamic scale is used equal to the quadratic sum of the transverse masses for all coloured partons [66]. The scattering amplitude for the hard process is evaluated numerically at LO accuracy by the program OpenLoops [67]; all resonances are treated in the narrow-width approximation [68], and spin correlations are neglected. The transfer function W (y, p) provides a mapping between the measured set of observables y and the final-state particles momenta p = (p 1 , . . . , p 8 ). Given the good angular resolution of jets, the direction of quarks is assumed to be perfectly measured by the direction of the associated jets. Also, since energies of leptons are measured more precisely than for jets, their momenta are considered perfectly measured. Under these assumptions, the total transfer function reduces to the product of the quark energy transfer function times the probability for the quarks that are not reconstructed as jets to fail the acceptance criteria. The quark energy transfer function is modelled by a single Gaussian function for jets associated with light-flavour partons, and by a double Gaussian function for jets associated with bottom quarks; the latter are constructed by superimposing two Gaussian functions with different mean and standard deviation. Such an asymmetric parametrisation provides a good description of both the core of the detector energy response and the low-energy tail arising from semileptonic B hadron decays. The parametrisation of the transfer functions has been derived from MC simulated samples.",

Firstly, the set of jets yielding the largest contribution to the sum defined by Eq. (1), determines the four (tagged) jets associated with bottom quarks; the remaining N untag (untagged) jets are assumed to originate either from W \u2192 qq decays (SL channel) or from initial-or final-state gluon radiation (SL and DL channels). There still remains a twelve-fold ambiguity in the determination of the parton matched to each jet, which is reflected by the sum in Eq. (3). Indeed, without distinguishing between b and b quarks, there exist 4!/(2!2!) = 6 combinations for assigning two jets out of four with the Higgs boson decay (H = ttH), or with the bottom quark-pair radiation (H = tt + bb); for each of these possibilities, there are two more ways of assigning the remaining tagged jets to either the t or t quark, thus giving a total of twelve associations. In the SL channel, an event can be classified in one of three possible categories. The first category (Cat-1) is defined by requiring at least six jets; if there are exactly six jets, the mass of the two untagged jets is required to be in the range [60,100] GeV, i.e. compatible with the mass of the W boson. If the number of jets is larger than six, the mass range is tightened to compensate for the increased ambiguity in selecting the correct W boson decay products. In the event interpretation, the W \u2192 qq decay is assumed to be fully reconstructed, with the two quarks identified with the jet pair satisfying the mass constraint. The definition of the second category (Cat-2) differs from that of Cat-1 by the inversion of the dijet mass constraint. This time, the event interpretation assumes that one of the quarks from the W boson decay has failed the reconstruction. The integration on the right-hand side of Eq. (3) is extended to include the phase space of the nonreconstructed quark. The other untagged jet(s) is (are) interpreted as gluon radiation, and do not enter the calculation of w(y|H). The total number of associations considered is twelve times the multiplicity of untagged jets eligible to originate from the W boson decay: N a = 12N untag . In the third category (Cat-3), exactly five jets are required, and an incomplete W boson reconstruction is again assumed. In the DL channel, only one event interpretation is considered, namely that each of the four bottom quarks in the decay is associated with one of the four tagged jets.",

(1) but restricting the sum only to the jet-quark associations considered in the calculation of w(y); the coefficients k s/b and k h/l in the denominators are positive constants that can differ among the categories and will be treated as optimisation parameters, as described below. The joint distribution of the (P s/b , P h/l ) discriminants is used in a two-dimensional maximum likelihood fit to search for events resulting from Higgs boson production. By construction, the two discriminants satisfy the constraint 0 \u2264 P s/b , P h/l \u2264 1. Because of the limited size of the simulated samples, the distributions of P s/b and P h/l are binned. A finer binning is used for the former, which carries the largest sensitivity to the signal, while the latter is divided into two equal-sized bins. The coefficient k s/b appearing in the definition of P s/b is introduced to adjust the relative normalisation between w(y|ttH) and w(y|tt + bb); likewise for k h/l . A redefinition of any of the two coefficients would change the corresponding discriminant monotonically, thus with no impact on its separation power. However, since both variables are analysed in bins with fixed size, an optimisation procedure, based on minimising the expected exclusion limit on the signal strength as described in Sect. 8, is carried out to choose the values that maximise the sensitivity of the analysis. More specifically, the coefficients k s/b are first set to the values that remove any local maximum for the tt + bb distribution around P s/b \u223c 1, a condition that is found to provide already close to optimal coefficients. Then, starting from this initial point, several values of k s/b are scanned and the P s/b distributions are recomputed accordingly. An expected upper limit on the signal strength is then evaluated for each choice of k s/b using the simulated samples. This procedure is repeated until a minimum in the expected limit is obtained. A similar procedure is applied for choosing the optimal k h/l coefficients.",

Each source of systematic uncertainty is associated with a nuisance parameter that modifies the likelihood function used to extract the signal yield, as described in Sect. 8. The prior knowledge on the nuisance parameter is incorporated into the likelihood in a frequentist manner by interpreting it as a posterior arising from a pseudomeasurement [70]. Nuisance parameters can affect either the yield of a process (normalisation uncertainty), or the shape of the P s/b and P h/l discriminants (shape uncertainty), or both. Multiple processes across several categories can be affected by the same source of uncertainty. In that case the related nuisance parameters are treated as fully correlated. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is estimated to be 2.6 % [71]. The lepton trigger, reconstruction, and identification efficiencies are determined from control regions by using a tag-and-probe procedure. The total uncertainty is evaluated from the statistical uncertainty of the tag-and-probe measurement, plus a systematic uncertainty in the method, and is estimated to be 1.6 % per muon and 1.5 % per electron. It is conservatively approximated to a constant 2 % per charged lepton. The uncertainty on the jet energy scale (JES) ranges from 1 % up to about 8 % of the expected energy scale depending on the jet p T and |\u03b7| [61]. For each simulated sample, two alternative distributions of the P s/b and P h/l discriminants are obtained by varying the energy scale of all simulated jets up or down by their uncertainty, and the fit is allowed to interpolate between the nominal and the alternative distributions with a Gaussian prior [70]. A similar procedure is applied to account for the uncertainty related to the jet energy resolution (JER), which ranges between about 5 and 10 % of the expected energy resolution depending on the jet direction. Since the analysis categories are defined in terms of the multiplicity and kinematic properties of the jets, a variation of either the scale or the resolution of the simulated jets can induce a migration of events in or out of the analysis categories, as well as migrations among different categories. The fractional change in the event yield induced by a shift of the JES (JER) ranges between 4-13 % (0.5-2 %), vector is recomputed accordingly. The scale factors applied to correct the CSV discriminator, as described in Sect. 4, are affected by several sources of systematic uncertainty. In the statistical interpretation, the fit can interpolate between the nominal and the two alternative distributions constructed by varying each scale factor up or down by its uncertainty.",

They are instead treated as correlated across several samples if they are related to common aspects of the simulation (e.g. PDF, scale variations). The modelling of the tt+jets background is affected by a variety of systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty due to the top-quark p T modelling is evaluated by varying the reweighting function r t ( p t T ), where The shaded and solid green bands correspond to the \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainty in the background prediction after the fit p t T is the transverse momentum of the generated top quark, between one (no correction at all) and 2r t \u2212 1 (the relative correction is doubled). This results in both a shape and a normalisation uncertainty. The latter can be as large as 20 % for a top quark p T around 300 GeV, and corresponds to an overall normalisation uncertainty of about 3-8 % depending on the category. To account for uncertainties in the tt + jets acceptance, the factorisation and renormalisation scales used in the simulation are varied in a correlated way by factors of 1/2 and 2 around their central value. The scale variation is assumed uncorrelated among tt + bb, tt + b, and tt + cc. In a similar way, independent scale variations are introduced for events with exactly one, two, or three extra partons in the matrix element. To account for possibly large K-factors due to the usage of a LO MC generator, the tt+bb, tt+b, and tt+cc normalisations predicted by the MadGraph simulation are assigned a 50 % uncertainty each. This value can be seen as a conservative upper limit to the theoretical uncertainty in the  tt + hf cross section achieved to date [64]. Essentially, the approach followed here is to assign large a priori normalisation uncertainties to the different tt + jets subprocesses, thus allowing the fit to simultaneously adjust their rates. Scale uncertainties in the inclusive theoretical cross sections used to normalise the simulated samples range from a few percent up to 20 %, depending on the process. The PDF uncertainty is treated as fully correlated for all processes that share the same dominant initial state (i.e. gg, gq, or qq); it ranges between 3 and 9 %, depending on the process. Finally, the effect of the limited size of the simulated samples is accounted for by introducing one nuisance parameter for each bin of the discriminant histograms and for each sample, as described in Ref. [72]. Table 2 summarises the various sources of systematic uncertainty with their impact on the analysis.",

The measured signal rate is characterised by a strength modifier \u03bc = \u03c3/\u03c3 SM that scales the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction with respect to its SM expectation for m H = 125 GeV. The nuisance parameters, \u03b8 , are incorporated into the likelihood as described in Sect. 7. The total likelihood function L (\u03bc, \u03b8) is the product of a Poissonian likelihood spanning all bins of the (P s/b , P h/l ) distributions for all the eight categories, times a likelihood function for the nuisance parameters. Based on the asymptotic properties of the profile likelihood ratio test statistic q(\u03bc) = \u22122 ln[L(\u03bc,\u03b8 \u03bc )/L(\u03bc,\u03b8)], confidence intervals on \u03bc are set, where\u03b8 and\u03b8 \u03bc indicate the best-fit value for \u03b8 obtained when \u03bc is floating in the fit or fixed at a hypothesised value, respectively. Figures 3 and 4 show the binned distributions of (P s/b , P h/l ) in the various categories and for the two channels. For visualisation purposes, the two-dimensional histograms are projected onto one dimension by showing first the distribution of P s/b for events with P h/l < 0.5 and then for P h/l \u2265 0.5. The observed distributions are compared to the signal-plusbackground expectation obtained from a combined fit to all categories with the constraint \u03bc = 1. No evidence of a ttH signal over the background is observed. The statistical interpretation is performed both in terms of exclusion upper limits (UL) at a 95 % CL, where the modified CL s prescription [73,74] is adopted to quote confidence intervals, and in terms of the maximum likelihood estimator of the strength modifier (\u03bc).",

In the signal-plusbackground (background-only) fit, the nuisance parameters that account for the 50 % normalisation uncertainty in the tt + bb, tt + b, and tt + cc backgrounds are pulled by +0.2 (+0.5), \u22120.4 (\u22120.3), and +0.8 (+0.8), respectively, where the pull is defined as the shift of the best-fit estimator from its nominal value in units of its a priori uncertainty. The correlation between the tt + bb normalisation nuisance and th\u00ea \u03bc estimator is found to be \u03c1 \u2248 \u22120.4, and is the largest entry in the correlation matrix. From an a priori study (i.e. before fitting the nuisance parameters with the likelihood function of the data), the nuisance parameter corresponding to the 50 % normalisation uncertainty in the tt+bb background features the largest impact on the median expected limit, which would be around 4 % smaller if that uncertainty were not taken into account. Such a reduced impact on the expected limit implies that the sensitivity of the analysis is only mildly affected by the lack of a stringent a priori constraint on the tt + bb background normalisation; this is also consistent with the observation that the fit effectively constrains the tt + bb rate, narrowing its normalisation uncertainty down to about 25 %.",

A total of 19.5 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 8 TeV has been analysed. Events with one lepton and at least five jets or two opposite-sign leptons and at least four jets have been considered. Jet b-tagging information is exploited to suppress the tt plus light-flavour background. A probability density value under either the ttH or the tt + bb background hypothesis is calculated for each event using an analytical matrix element method. The ratio of probability densities under these two competing hypotheses allows a one-dimensional discriminant to be defined, which is then used together with b-tagging information in a likelihood analysis to set constraints on the signal strength modifier \u03bc = \u03c3/\u03c3 SM .",

Within the present statistics, the analysis documented in this paper yields competitive results compared to those obtained on the same data set and for the same final state by using non-analytical multivariate techniques [28]. However, the matrix element method applied for a maximal separation between the signal and the dominant tt + bb background allows for a better control of the systematic uncertainty due to this challenging background. This method represents a promising strategy towards a precise determination of the top quark Yukawa coupling. Once the statistical uncertainty will be reduced by the inclusion of the upcoming 13 TeV collision data, systematic uncertainties will start to play a more important role. By incorporating experimental and theoretical model parameters into an event likelihood, the matrix element method offers a natural handle to minimise the impact of systematic uncertainties on the extraction of the signal.",
