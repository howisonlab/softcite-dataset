These results are obtained from a large data sample that contains 657 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. For the CP violation parameters, we obtain two consistent solutions that describe the data well. The first of these solutions may be preferred by external information from other measurements. There is no evidence for direct CP violation in B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)K 0 S , B 0 \u2192 f 0 (980)K 0 S and B 0 \u2192 K * + (892)\u03c0 \u2212 , while measurements of mixing-induced CP violation in B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)K 0",

At present, mixing-induced CP violation has been clearly observed by the BaBar [3] and Belle [4] Collaborations in the b \u2192 ccs induced decay, B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S , while many other modes provide additional information on CP violating parameters. Of recent interest is CP violation in b \u2192 qqs transitions, which proceeds by loop diagrams that may be affected by new particles in various extensions of the SM. Furthermore, the CP asymmetries in b \u2192 qqs transitions are expected in the SM to be slightly higher than those observed in b \u2192 ccs transitions [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. However, current experimental measurements [14] tend to be lower than those for b \u2192 ccs transitions motivating more precise experimental determinations.",

Quasi-twobody time-dependent analyses have been performed on B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)K 0 S by the BaBar Collaboration [15] and B 0 \u2192 f 0 (980)K 0 S by both the BaBar and Belle Collaborations [16,17]. However, a two-body approach to these modes is not ideal due to interference with other resonances as well as non-resonant decays into the same final state. These effects can be taken into account with a time-dependent Dalitz plot fit. In addition, the interference terms in some cases may be sensitive to the cosine of the effective weak phase difference (\u03c6 eff 1 ) in mixing, potentially resolving the two-fold ambiguity in \u03c6 eff 1 characteristic of quasi-twobody analyses. Current direct measurements of cos 2\u03c6 1 from b \u2192 ccs prefer the solution of \u03c6 1 = 21.5 \u2022 over \u03c6 1 = 68.5 \u2022 [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and similarly, it is important to attempt to resolve this quadratic ambiguity in b \u2192 qqs modes as well.",

Since direct CP violation has been observed in B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 [24,25], CP violation could also be present in B 0 \u2192 K * + (892)\u03c0 \u2212 decays, though existing measurements are consistent with zero [26]. This measurement may also be related to the A CP (K\u03c0) puzzle; the asymmetry in B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 is found to be significantly different from that in B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 0 . This unexpected result may indicate the presence of new physics (NP) or poor understanding of strong interaction effects in B decays. A model-independent test for NP is possible via an isospin sum rule with high statistics [27]. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the phase difference between B 0 \u2192 K * + (892)\u03c0 \u2212 andB 0 \u2192 K * \u2212 (892)\u03c0 + can be used to extract \u03c6 3 [28,29,30,31].

Operating with a peak luminosity that exceeds 1.7 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , the collider produces the \u03a5(4S) resonance ( \u221a s = 10.58 GeV) with a Lorentz boost of \u03b2\u03b3 = 0.425, opposite to the positron beam direction, z, which usually decays into a BB pair. The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprised of CsI (Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron fluxreturn located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [40]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector (SVD1) was used for the first sample of 152 \u00d710 6 BB pairs, while a 1.5 cm beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector (SVD2) and a small-cell inner drift chamber was used to record the remaining 505 \u00d710 6 BB pairs [41]. We use a GEANT-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine its acceptance [42].",

Since their topology tends to be jet-like in contrast to the spherical BB decay, continuum can be suppressed with a Fisher discriminant based on modified Fox-Wolfram moments [44]. This discriminant is combined with the polar angle of the B candidate in the CMS, cos \u03b8 B , which follows a 1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 B distribution for BB events while being flat for continuum. A requirement that rejects 91% of the continuum background while retaining 73% of the signal events is applied. The second largest background comes from charm decays of the B meson and peaks in the signal region. We apply the charm vetoes summarized in Table II. The fraction of events having more than one reconstructed candidate in regions dominanted by particular quasi-two-body modes is 28% for B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)K 0 S , 25% for B 0 \u2192 f 0 (980)K 0 S and 21% for B 0 \u2192 K * + (892)\u03c0 \u2212 .

This criteria introduces negligible bias into the \u2206E distribution.

This PDF is convolved with the \u2206t resolution function, R B 0B0 , described in Ref. [43]. On the other hand, detector resolution is ignored in the Dalitz plot because the widths of the dominant resonances are large compared to the mass resolution. For example, the detector resolution in the region of the narrowest resonance, the f 0 (980), is typically 4 MeV, while most estimates of the f 0 (980) width tend to be at least an order of magnitude larger [34]. The relative signal detection efficiency variation across the Dalitz plane due to detector acceptance, \u01eb(m \u2032 , \u03b8 \u2032 ), is also considered and is taken from MC. Misreconstructed events usually occur around the corners of the Dalitz plot with a slow pion from the tag side. The fraction of misreconstruction can be as high as 10% in these regions. As misreconstruction is not accounted for in the signal model, its effect will be included in the systematic errors.",

Solutions 1 and 2 were found in the previous Belle analysis [37] and correspond to the two solutions found in the higher statistics Belle Dalitz plot analysis of the isospin partner mode, B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [47]. The signal models used in this analysis and that of the isospin partner are almost identical. These two solutions are due to an interplay between the two broad S-wave amplitudes, K * + 0 (1430)\u03c0 \u2212 and the non-resonant component, and are characterized by their different relative fractions. However, they give almost indistinguishable Dalitz plot distributions; studies with high statistics pseudo-experiments confirm the existence of these two solutions. Solution 3 has a high f 0 (980)K 0 S fraction compared with Solution 2 that may indicate a similar type of interference between f 0 (980) and the non-resonant component. Unlike the previous case, Solution 3 cannot be found in a high statistics toy MC sample generated with Solution 2, neither can Solution 2 be reproduced from Solution 3 indicating that one of these solutions cannot survive with higher experimental statistics. Considering that a solution with a high f 0 (980)K 0 S fraction was not found in the previous analysis or the higher statistics B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 analysis [47], we therefore conclude that Solution 3 is due to statistical fluctuations in the small B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample and is unlikely to be a physical solution. Solution 4 appears to be statistically consistent with Solution 2 for all parameters, while Solution 4 cannot be reproduced from a high statistics toy MC sample generated with Solution 2 and vice versa. This indicates that these two solutions are likely due to a statistical fluctuation of a single solution and we select Solution 2 as the nominal solution of the two because of its slightly better likelihood. Consequently, Solutions 1 and 2 are treated as the solutions of this analysis. The high K * + 0 (1430)\u03c0 \u2212 fraction of Solution 1 is in agreement with some phenomenological estimates [48] and may also be qualitatively favored by the total K \u2212 \u03c0 S-wave phase shift as a function of m(K\u03c0) when compared with that measured by the LASS collaboration [49]. As the likelihood difference is not found to be significant using an ensemble of pseudoexperiments corresponding to the luminosity of the data sample, we retain both solutions.",

            "text": "The systematic errors in the vertex reconstruction include uncertainties in the IP profile, charged track selection based on track helix errors, helix parameter corrections, \u2206t and vertex goodness-of-fit selection, \u2206z bias and SVD misalignment. The parameters for w and \u2206w, resolution function, physics parameters, background shape and signal probability are varied by \u00b11\u03c3. Where histograms were used, all bins are simultaneously but independently varied by their respective errors. The effect of CP asymmetry in the background is estimated by varying the CP parameters of the entire neutral B component within the physical range except for B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 S , which is varied within its known uncertainties. Toy MC samples showed some small fitting bias for CP parameters due to low statistics in each sample. We take this bias as a systematic uncertainty. The effect of misreconstructed signal events is also investigated using signal MC. This is achieved by comparing the fit result of the signal MC sample with another fit on the same sample, which required that the events were reconstructed correctly. The efficiency histogram also includes systematic uncertainties in    correction factors due to tracking, K 0 S selection and particle identification. The systematics from these data to MC efficiency ratios are calculated from independent studies at Belle. Tag-side interference, which only affects CP eigenstates, comes from CP violation on the tag side [51], and is estimated with B \u2192 D * l\u03bd. We generate MC pseudo-experiments and perform an ensemble test to obtain systematic biases from tag-side interference [52]. In the signal model, the Dalitz plot mass, widths and other parameters are varied by their errors and the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors are included. The Dalitz plot model is the dominant systematic source and is quoted separately. We introduce additional resonances, K * 2 (1430), K * 0 (1680), \u03c9(782), \u03c1 0 (1450), \u03c1 0 (1700) and f 0 (1710) into the signal model to estimate possible effects from other resonances not included in the nominal model. These resonances are included separately with their amplitudes and phases as free parameters and their CP parameters shared with the f 2 (1270), f X (1300) and the non-resonant component. The amplitudes of these additional resonances are not found to be significant. The shape of the non-resonant component is empirically chosen, so different parametrizations are tested. They include modeling the non-resonant part with the tail of a Breit-Wigner, R NR (s; \u03b1) = i\u03b1/(s + i\u03b1) and a power law whose exponent is a fit parameter, R NR (s; \u03b1) = s \u2212\u03b1 . The fit differences from these alternate Dalitz plot parametrizations were summed in quadrature. The systematic errors for both solutions are summarized in Table VII and Table VIII. As the systematic uncertainty from the Dalitz plot model is the largest, it is quoted separately.",
