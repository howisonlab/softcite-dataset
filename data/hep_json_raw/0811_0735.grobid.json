These relatively energetic gammas should be easily seen in SK and readily reconstructed as events with their own vertex position, time, and total energy, allowing event-by-event correlation with previous positron-like events' timing and position information. Natural gadolinium has a neutron absorption cross section of \u223c 49,700 barns as compared to 0.33 barns for free protons, so the amount of GdCl 3 needed for this method to be effective is quite small. To get over 90 % of thermal neutrons to capture on gadolinium instead of hydrogen, 0.2 % by mass of dissolved GdCl 3 (i.e., about 0.1 % Gd by mass) is sufficient.",

Both 4.43 MeV \u03b3-rays and neutrons are released from the source concurrently via: \u03b1 + 9 Be \u2192 12 C * (4.43 MeVdeexcitation\u03b3) + n using \u03b1's emitted from 241 Am. A reaction to the ground state of 12 C also exists, which produces only a neutron. The source intensity used in the experiments is 97 \u00b5Ci of 241 Am, which leads to 86.8 Hz of 4.43 MeV \u03b3-rays and 76.4 Hz for the 12 C ground state reaction. The scintillation light induced from these gammas were used to initiate prompt signals, while accompanying neutrons were treated as delayed signals. Usage of the BGO compensated for the disadvantage of low Cherenkov photon generation for the 4.43 MeV \u03b3-rays in water. The scintillation light was typically observed as \u223c 1,000 photo-electrons, or equivalently, 1,000 PMT hits in SK. This high light output was capable of issuing the so-called \"high energy trigger,\" one of the trigger types used in the normal data-taking (see Section 3). Moreover, the 300 ns decay time constant of BGO scintillation light was long enough to discriminate it from Cherenkov events originating from either 8 MeV gamma cascades and 2.2 MeV gammas. An acrylic cylindrical vessel was used to study the detection of 8 MeV gamma cascades liberated from Gd. This vessel was filled with 2.4 liters of 0.2 % GdCl 3 -water solution together with the Am/Be-embedded BGO scintillator installed in the middle of the cylinder, as depicted in Figure 1. ",

            "text": "In SK's normal data taking, there are three types of trigger signals derived from the total number of coincident PMT hits (HITSUM) in the inner detector. They are the \"Super Low Energy\" (SLE) trigger, the \"Low Energy\" (LE) trigger, and the \"High Energy\" (HE) trigger. The HITSUM, as illustrated in Figure 2, is the analog sum of all hit PMT signals within 200 ns. Once the HITSUM is above the designed threshold, a global trigger is issued and PMT data are digitized and stored in the internal buffers of the front-end electronics. PMT data are then read out and stored in the two 1-MByte memories of the Super Memory Partner (SMP), from which data will be transported to the online system. Since the lowest energy trigger thresold at SK (SLE, 4.6 MeV) is higher than 2.2 MeV, neutron signals in pure water cannot be observed. To measure neutron tagging efficiency, a standard nuclear instrument module (NIM) compatible with current SK electronics was developed by using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and a micro-controller in order to provide selected triggers without threshold. This module can accept trigger signals from the SK DAQ system to issue a new trigger scheme as already shown in Figure 2. The forced trigger parameters such as forced trigger rate and the number of forced triggers can be programmed. During the experiments, 500 \u00d7 1 \u00b5s continuous forced triggers were generated after each  primary trigger, whose repetition width was set on the basis of the electronics' dynamic range. Due to the limitations of the front-end electronics buffering capability and the two 1-MByte memories of the SMP, only about 128 triggers per primary were collected. The front-end buffering limitation caused a 70 \u00b5s gap between two bunches of forced trigger events. Since it is very likely that other trigger events might have occupied the front-end electronic buffer, the number of forced trigger events in the first bunch was usually less than 64. Due to the limitation of two buffer memories of the SMP and the speed of the reading process, all the triggers were vetoed after collecting about 128 forced trigger events. These limitations will be eliminated after the upgrade of SK electronics in September 2008, when 500 \u00b5s forced trigger data can be fully taken. As mentioned in Section 2, the 4.43 MeV \u03b3-induced scintillation event rate was 86.8 Hz. To reduce dead time, we limited the primary trigger being used to generate the forced triggers to 4 Hz.",

            "text": "Events consistent with delayed 8 MeV gamma cascades were expected to be reconstructed around the Am/Be radioactive source. The histogram in Figure  4(a) depicts the distribution of \u2206R = \u221a x 2 + y 2 + z 2 in cm for delayed signal data, where \u2206R was the distance measured from the center of the GdCl 3 vessel (i.e., Am/Be source position) whose coordinates were identified with (x src , y src , z src ) = (35.3 cm, -70.7 cm, 0.0 cm). In SK, the z-axis was defined to run vertically, with its origin at the detector's center. Both x-and y-axes were perpendicular to each other and to the z-axis. Therefore, the origin of our coordinate system (0, 0, 0) corresponded to the physical center of the SK detector. The majority of delayed signal events were observed in \u2206R < 200.0 cm. A scatter plot of these is shown in Figure 4(b) with respect to z [cm] versus x 2 + y 2 [cm 2 ], which clearly depicts the concentration of events the region \u2206R < 200.0 cm. Detection of 8 MeV gamma cascades was therefore demonstrated through this vertex reconstruction in the vicinity of the Am/Be radioactive source. Event selections at this stage included the \u2206T ranges described in the previous section, the choice of reconstructed Cherenkov ring events, the energy region above 3 MeV, and the fiducial volume region which contained the innermost 22.5 kton cylindrical water region. The Cherenkov ring selection depends upon the pattern goodness of the fitted ring. This is evaluated via a determination of the goodness of direction reconstruction using the uniformity of hit PMTs about its presumed direction.  The data and MC spectra were found to be consistent with each other, and the mean energy value given by a Gaussian fit of the data was 4.3 \u00b1 0.1 MeV. That this number was lower than 8 MeV was expected, given the various combinations of multiple \u03b3-rays possible in the cascades. These gamma energies typically fall between 1 \u223c 2 MeV, with the lowest energy gammas unable to Compton scatter electrons above Cherenkov threshold; such gammas are invisible in SK. Figure 5(b) depicts the thermal neutron capture time of delayed events in data. The remaining events in the \u2206T range of 134.8 \u00b5s \u223c 181.8 \u00b5s resulted from thermal neutrons being scattered back into the Gd regions after having traveled out of the 2.4 liter cylinder. This phenomenon was studied with the capture time spectrum of data independently taken without using the forced trigger, as shown in Figure 5(c). Triggers of this data were issued by the standard SK trigger system which required at least 17 PMT hits within a 200 ns window as described in Section 3. The lowest level triggers, or \"super low energy\" triggers were vetoed for 30 \u00b5s right after the higher level ones (high energy triggers) were issued. Data in the range \u2206T < 30 \u00b5s were unavailable with this data-taking method. Distributions both in Figure 5(b) and (c) were fitted with a sum of two exponentials, and the capture time of thermal neutrons immediately captured on Gd were derived from the first fitted component to be \u03c4 = 20.7 \u00b1 5.5 \u00b5s and \u03c4 = 21.2 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5s, respectively.

Understanding the background probability will be indispensable for the eventual future detection of relic supernova neutrinos, one of the principal physics interests in SK. The present singles background level above 10 MeV in SK fiducial volume is 8 events per day. The expected\u03bd e event rate from relic supernovas is 7 events per year with neutron tagging. A reduction in background probability to \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 times the current rate must therefore be achieved at this energy. In order to investigate the possibility of achieving this reduction, randomly triggered data in SK were taken. For this application, a 60 \u00b5s window was adopted together with all the other event selection criteria already established in the previous sections. A 60 \u00b5s window was sufficient to cover more than 90 % of neutron capture events based upon the measured capture time. Table  1 summarizes the results of background probability at three different energy thresholds for delayed signals between 2.5 MeV and 3.5 MeV. The probability at 3.0 MeV of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 times the current rate leads to the conclusion that a 3.0 MeV threshold for delayed events will be satisfactory to accomplish\u03bd e observations at 10 MeV. The neutron detection efficiency was evaluated including the effect of 8 MeV gamma cascade events extracted above 3.0 MeV. Figure 6 depicts an energy distribution for these events and 92.3 % efficiency is maintained above this energy. Other components included were: 80.2 % remaining after event selection, and 90 % neutron capturing efficiency on Gd loaded at 0.1 % by mass. The total detection efficiency of thermal neutrons on Gd was therefore 66.7 %. Table 1 Summary of the background probability at three different energy thresholds for the delayed events. The study shows that 3.0 MeV for delayed signals will be satisfactory to enable\u03bd e detection at a 10 MeV analysis threshold in SK. ",

The timing selection ensured that no neutrons from previous events would contaminate the sample. It was also required that forced trigger events should not have more than 200 PMT hits in order to eliminate other coincident but non-neutron events. Neutrons produced via inverse beta decays have a \u223c 50 cm free mean path and about a 200 \u00b5s lifetime in pure water. These features could be exploited. Monte Carlo study showed that knowing the capture location could significantly reduce background. In this study, we used the source position to subtract the time of flight for each timing measurement, correcting the timing spread up to 150 ns. This correction could restore all relevant hits to form a timing peak within 15 ns, which was significantly different from those from all the backgrounds.

They were the average opening angle of the hits, the angular uniformity of the hits, the number of hits within the 10 ns window (N 10 ), the fraction of the hits in the forward hemisphere (N f orward /N 10 ), the mean distance of the hits to their center of gravity, and the maximum distance among all the combinations of the hits. Some level of correlation was observed between these variables. A neural-net method implemented in ROOT [10] was then applied to optimize the selection criteria. The signal sample for neural-net training was from Monte Carlo simulation, while the background sample was from the background run, in which the background data were divided into a training sample and a test sample. Several neural-net architectures were tried and the two-hidden-layer network with six input neurons was selected for giving the best performance. The neural-net training procedure was conducted for each source location. The neutron detection efficiency and the background probability are shown in Figure 7 as a function of the selection on the neural-net output value. To select neutron signals from the source run data, all candidates were required to have a neural-net output value greater than 0.99. The \u2206T (Section 4.1) distribution is given in Figure 8 for the three different locations. All source runs showed the expected exponential curves for the neutron capture lifetime in pure water. In contrast, the background runs only showed flat distributions due to the environmental background ( Figure 8). The levels of contamination can be directly read from the vertical axes, since they were all normalized to the same number of primary triggers.",

A fixed 200 \u00b5s neutron capture lifetime is used to derive the neutron detection efficiencies. The first uncertainties are statistical, the second and the third uncertainties correspond to 20 \u00b5s lifetime uncertainty and 30 Hz neutron emission rate uncertainty. For comparison, the estimated efficiencies from Monte Carlo simulations, the environmental background probabilities and the goodness of the fits are given in the table.",

The efficiency is observed to increase when the capture location is close to the wall of the inner tank, since the small amount of light produced by the 2.2 MeV gammas suffers less attenuation effects. The position-independent background probability is considered to be approximately 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 . Backgrounds are originated from \u03b3's from the rock surrounding the detector, radioactive decay in the PMT glass, and radon contamination in the water.",

A study using this technique achieved 66.7 % neutron tagging efficiency with a 3 MeV energy threshold for delayed events. Moreover, a background reduction level of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at a 10 MeV prompt event analysis threshold for\u03bd e 's was realized.",
