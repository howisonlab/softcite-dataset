            "text": "Photoproduction of vector mesons (VMs) is usually thought of as a process where the photon fluctuates into a qq state, which then interacts with the proton and becomes a VM. If the spatial configuration of the qq state is large, its interaction with the proton is soft in nature and is usually described by Regge theory [1] together with the vector dominance model [2,3]. This applies to exclusive photoproduction of the light VMs \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 (see Ivanov, Nikolaev and Savin [4] for a recent review). For heavy VMs, the qq pair is squeezed into a small configuration and perturbative QCD (pQCD) [5] can be applied. In exclusive photoproduction of J/\u03c8, \u03b3 p \u2192 J/\u03c8 p, the mass of the J/\u03c8 provides a hard scale at the photon vertex and the small-size qq pair interacts through a two-gluon ladder with partons in the proton. If the four-momentum-transfer squared at the proton vertex is small, |t| 1 GeV 2 , and the proton stays intact, the cross section is predicted to fall exponentially with |t|.",

The CTD consisted of 72 cylindrical drift chamber layers, organised in 9 superlayers covering the polar-angle 2 region 15 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 164 \u2022 . The transverse-momentum resolution for full-length tracks was \u03c3(p T )/p T = 0.0058p T \u2295 0.0065 \u2295 0.0014/p T , with p T in GeV. The highresolution uranium-scintillator calorimeter (CAL) [18][19][20][21]consisted of three parts: the forward (FCAL), the barrel (BCAL) and the rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part was subdivided transversely into towers and longitudinally into one electromagnetic section (EMC) and either one (in RCAL) or two (in BCAL and FCAL) hadronic sections (HAC). The smallest subdivision of the calorimeter is called a cell. The CAL energy resolutions, as measured under test-beam conditions, were \u03c3(E)/E = 0.18/ \u221a E for electrons and \u03c3(E)/E = 0.35/ \u221a E for hadrons, with E in GeV. The muon system [22] consisted of tracking detectors (forward, barrel and rear muon chambers: FMUON, B/RMUON), which were placed inside and outside a magnetised iron yoke surrounding the CAL. The inner chambers, F/B/RMUI, covered the polar angles from 10 \u2022 to 34 \u2022 , from 34 \u2022 to 135 \u2022 and from 135 \u2022 to 171 \u2022 , respectively.",

In the leading logarithmic (LL) approximation, the process is described by the effective exchange of a gluon ladder. As stated in the introduction, the process under study has two scales.

We thank the DESY directorate for their strong support and encouragement. We want to thank Asher Gotsman, Jeff Forshaw, Lonya Frankfurt, Uri Maor, Leszek Motyka and Mark Strikman for many useful discussions. We are grateful to Rikard Enberg, Eran Naftali and Michael Zhalov for providing the results of their theoretical calculations.",
