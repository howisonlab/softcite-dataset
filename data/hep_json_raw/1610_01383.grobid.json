            "text": "The B + meson is a bound state of a heavy b quark and a u quark, with well known properties and a large number of decay modes [1], but little is known about decays of B + mesons to a J/ \u03c8 meson plus a large number of light hadrons. The B + \u2192 J/ \u03c83\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 decay channel is of particular interest, since it is one of the highest multiplicity final states currently experimentally accessible. Evidence for the corresponding decay of the B + c meson has recently been reported by the LHCb collaboration [2], with the measured branching fraction and qualitative behaviour of the multipion system consistent with expectations from QCD factorisation [3,4]. In this scheme, the B + c \u2192 J/ \u03c83\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 decay is characterized by the form factors of the B + c \u2192 J/ \u03c8W + transition and the spectral functions for the conversion of the W + boson into light hadrons [5][6][7][8]. Different decay topologies contribute to decays of B + mesons into charmonia and light hadrons, affecting the dynamics of the multipion system and enabling the role of factorisation in B + meson decays to be probed. e-mail: Ivan. Belyaev@itep.ru This paper describes an analysis of B + \u2192 J/ \u03c83\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 decays, including decays to the same final state that proceed through an intermediate \u03c8 (2S) resonance. Charge-conjugate modes are implied throughout the paper. The ratios of the branching fractions for each of these decays to that of the normalisation decay B + \u2192 \u03c8 (2S)K + ,",

Each B + candidate is associated with the PV with respect to which it has the smallest \u03c7 2 IP , which is defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the PV with and without the particle under consideration. To improve the mass resolution, a kinematic fit [20] is applied. In this fit the mass of the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 combination is fixed to the known J/ \u03c8 mass, and the B + candidate's momentum vector is required to originate at the associated PV. A good-quality fit is required to further suppress combinatorial background. In addition, the measured decay time of the B + candidate, calculated with respect to the associated PV, is required to be larger than 200 \u03bcm/c, to suppress background from particles coming from the PV.",

The different contributions to the systematic uncertainties affecting this analysis are described below. The resulting individual uncertainties are presented in Table 4.  The dominant uncertainty arises from the imperfect knowledge of the shape of the signal and the background in the B + and \u03c8 (2S) mass distributions. The dependence of the signal yields on the fit model is studied by varying the signal and background parametrisations. The systematic uncertainties are determined for the ratios of event yields in different channels by taking the maximum deviation of the ratio obtained with the alternative model with respect to the baseline fit model. The uncertainty determined for R \u03c8 (2S) and R 5\u03c0 is 4.6 and 2.4%, respectively.",
