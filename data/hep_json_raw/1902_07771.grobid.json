            "text": "Abstract The Neutrino Mass Ordering (NMO) remains one of the outstanding questions in the field of neutrino physics. One strategy to measure the NMO is to observe matter effects in the oscillation pattern of atmospheric neutrinos above \u223c 1 GeV, as proposed for several next-generation neutrino experiments. Moreover, the existing IceCube DeepCore detector can already explore this type of measurement. We present the development and application of two independent analyses to search for the signature of the NMO with three years of DeepCore data. These analyses include a full treatment of systematic uncertainties and a statistically-rigorous method to determine the significance for the NMO from a fit to the data. Both analyses show that the dataset is fully compatible with both mass orderings. For the more sensitive analysis, we observe a preference for normal ordering with a p-value of p IO = 15.3% and CL s = 53.3% for the inverted ordering hypothesis, while the experimental results from both analyses are consistent within their uncertainties. Since the result is independent of the value of \u03b4 CP and obtained from energies E \u03bd 5 GeV, it is complementary to recent results from long-baseline experiments. These analyses set the groundwork for the future of this measurement with more capable detectors, such as the IceCube Upgrade and the proposed PINGU detector.",

Depending on the NMO, these modulations arise mainly in the neutrino (NO) or anti-neutrino channel (IO) [11]. In measurements of solar neutrino oscillations, they were used to determine the ordering of the neutrino states \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 by finding m 2 > m 1 . Moreover, these modulations can be observed for atmospheric neutrinos that undergo matter effects during their propagation through the Earth. In contrast to longbaseline accelerator experiments, the signature observed in IceCube is largely independent of the value of \u03b4 CP , which allows for a complementary measurement of the NMO at higher energies, using atmospheric neutrinos [12].",

These mesons decay generating electron and muon (anti-)neutrinos, which propagate through the Earth and can eventually be detected by an underground neutrino detector, such as IceCube [13]. The baseline of propagation through Earth can be inferred by measuring the incoming zenith angle of the neutrino. The highest-energy oscillation maximum arises at E \u03bd \u223c 25 GeV for vertically up-going neutrinos, moving to lower energy at shorter baselines towards the horizon. For energies above a few GeV, the oscillations are mostly driven by the parameters \u03b8 23 and m 2 31 , which are therefore referred to as atmospheric oscillation parameters [4], while for vacuum only oscillations the value of \u03b8 13 is too small for any detectable effect. Considering matter effects, however, the effective value of \u03b8 13 under the right conditions can become sizeable, resulting in oscillation with electron flavors as shown in Fig. 2.",

For detectors insensitive to distinguishing neutrinos from anti-neutrinos on an eventby-event level, the NMO still leads to a visible net-effect in the amplitude of the observed matter effects, because the atmospheric fluxes and the cross sections for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos differ [16,17]. These differences mean that atmospheric neutrinos are measured at higher rates than the corresponding anti-neutrinos.

It consists of 8 strings with an increased vertical density of DOMs with higher quantum-efficiency, surrounding one Ice- Table 1 Overview of the main differences between the two NMO analyses in terms of the total number of observed events, the selection strategy, the reconstruction likelihood, the reconstructed energy range, the number of analysis bins (given as number of E reco \u03bd , \u03d1 reco \u03bd , PID bins), the background (atmospheric muon) description, the template generation, and the estimated fractions of the data sample from each contribution Cube string. Due to the denser instrumentation and the higher quantum-efficiency DOMs, the DeepCore infill has a lower energy threshold than the surrounding IceCube array. The corresponding detection efficiency of DeepCore increases steeply between \u223c 3 GeV and \u223c 10 GeV and flattens for higher energies [13,37]. Neutrinos are detected by the Cherenkov emissions of their charged secondary particles, which are generated by Charged Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) interactions with the nucleons of the ice. In the case of CC muonneutrino interactions, a hadronic cascade is initiated at the primary vertex, combined with an outgoing muon. The muon can propagate large distances through the detector, leading to an elongated shape of the energy deposition and thus of the Cherenkov light emission. Such events are called track-like signatures. In contrast, CC electron-neutrino, NC, and the majority of CC tau-neutrino interactions, do not produce a muon that can travel large distances. Instead, they initiate an electromagnetic and/or hadronic cascade that develops over a distance of a few meters. The light emission of this cascade is considerably smeared around the Cherenkov angle of the shower direction. Such events are called cascade-like. At low energies below a few tens of GeV, the separation of trackand cascade-like events becomes increasingly difficult, due to the short muon track and the coarse detector granularity. For oscillation measurements with DeepCore, this separation of track-like and cascade-like events is used to partially distinguish neutrino flavors [37].",

The difference in livetime arises from slightly different criteria on the stability of data acquisition. The data is run through two largely independent processing chains, where both samples are acquired by filtering the data in several successive steps of selection. These steps include the application of selection criteria on well-understood variables, as well as machine-learning methods, namely Boosted Decision Trees [51]. The selections are aiming for a reduction of the background of atmospheric muons and triggered noise, while maintaining a large fraction of well-reconstructed, low-energy neutrino events below E \u03bd \u223c 100 GeV. Both samples are described in more detail in [48]. Compared to [48], the samples used in this work differ by the following modifications:",

The loss in energy resolution is due to the unobserved fraction of deposited energy outside the Fig. 3 The distribution of the particle identification variable for Analysis A. The blue band on the data/MC ratio is the statistical uncertainty detector volume. Second, the range of reconstructed energies considered is extended for both analyses compared to [48], from 56 to 90 GeV (80 GeV) for Analysis A (B), allowing us to constrain nuisance parameters outside the strongest oscillation region.

The reconstruction is run separately for a starting track and a cascade-only hypothesis, where the starting track hypothesis features a cascade at the primary vertex with an additional parameter L for the length of an outgoing muon track. Since the track hypothesis allows for fitting the track length to L = 0, the 7dimensional cascade-only-hypothesis is nested within the 8-dimensional track-hypothesis. The log-likelihood difference between track and cascade-only hypothesis is used as the flavor-separating variable, called Particle Identification (PID).

Besides the parameters included in the fit, additional uncertainties have been investigated and tested for their possible effect on the analysis [49,50]. These parameters are the normalizations of sub-dominant experimental backgrounds (detector noise and event pile-up from coincident atmospheric muons), additional uncertainties on the optical properties of the ice, the oscillation parameters (\u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , m 2 21 , and \u03b4 CP ), and Bjorken-x dependent uncertainties in the cross section for deep-inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering. Two types of tests were performed to determine the impact of these parameters. In the first test, a parameter is injected into a MC fake dataset, shifted from its nominal value by \u00b1 1\u03c3 in the case of Table 2 Systematics treated as nuisance parameters in the likelihood analysis, including normalization (N), detector response (D), oscillation (O), flux (F), and neutrino-nucleon interaction (I) uncertainties. These parameters are discussed in more detail in [48]. The table gives the baseline value and, if the parameter is used with a prior in the likelihood, the standard deviation of the Gaussian prior, as well as the experimental best-fit values for both analyses and ordering hypotheses Label Parameter allowed to vary freely (no prior) in both analyses a detector systematic and by \u00b1 3\u03c3 in the case of an oscillation parameter. This MC fake data is fit using the same MC set, but with the parameter in question fixed to its unshifted nominal value to assess whether the uncertainty in the systematic parameter can bias the measured ordering hypothesis. This test is repeated for MC fake datasets generated with both mass orderings. For none of these systematic or oscillation parameters is a bias observed in the measured preference for the mass ordering of more than 0.05\u03c3 . For the case of \u03b4 CP , the value of \u03b4 CP = 180 \u2022 is being used as the 'nominal' value for the MC fake dataset, with the value of \u03b4 CP = 270 \u2022 injected into the MC used in the fit; a negligible (less than 0.01\u03c3 ) bias in the ordering preference is observed. In the second test, the same shifted values as above are injected into the MC fake dataset, but now the parameter under test is allowed to vary in the fit. This allows us to determine if the inclusion of these parameters into the fit causes any loss of sensitivity to the mass ordering. None of the parameters in question cause a loss of sensitivity of more than 0.05\u03c3 ; the inclusion of \u03b4 CP reduces the sensitivity by less than 0.03\u03c3 . Since all the parameters described in this paragraph are shown to have no impact on the mass ordering sensitivity, or the potential to cause a bias, they have been set to their nominal values (in the case of oscillation parameters, to the NuFit [32] best-fit values), and are not included in the final fit in order to minimise the computing time required for the multi-parameter minimisation.",

Afterwards, each PT is fitted with both ordering hypotheses, resulting in a new value for the TS = \u03c7 2 NO\u2212IO = 2 LLH NO\u2212IO .

Its value is limited to CL S \u2208 [0, 1], where CL S \u2248 1 indicates no preference for one hypothesis over the other and CL S \u2248 0 indicates a strong disfavoring of the given hypothesis. The CL S value can be interpreted as confidence in the result with a confidence level of 1 \u2212 CL S . More illustratively, the CL S value describes how much less likely the observed value would occur under the disfavored hypothesis, compared to the favored one. Finally, potential improvements of the sensitivity are tested for Analysis A. By fixing individual and combinations of systematic parameters in the Asimov fit, the absolute gain in sensitivity from an improved understanding of systematic uncertainties is found to be small, except for the oscillation parameters. This is due to the weak NMO signature, which barely pulls the systematic parameters and thus is only weakly affected by fixing them. Instead, it is found that the sensitivity could be improved in the future by additional data statistics and improvements on the event reconstruction, which reduce the smearing-out of the NMO signature due to the low resolution in energy, zenith, and PID at the lowest energies [49].",

The sensitivities were estimated with two independent methods. For the more sensitive, main analysis, the sensitivity was found to be \u223c 0.45 \u2212 0.65 \u03c3 (one-sided Gaussian), within the most interesting region close to maximum mixing (sin 2 (\u03b8 23 ) \u2208 [0.45, 0.55]) for both orderings, while for the confirmatory analysis, the sensitivity was found to be \u223c 50% smaller.",

This result is in line with recently reported preferences for the NO by Super-Kamiokande [29], T2K [27], NO\u03bdA [28], MINOS [64], and recent global best fits [31,32]. However, it complements these results due to the higher energy range used for determining the NMO (E \u03bd 5 GeV) and the fact that it is independent of the value of \u03b4 CP . Finally, the data indicates a preference for matter effects over vacuum oscillations, independent of the assumption on the NMO.",

Given the statistically-limited nature of this result, it is clear that a reduction of systematic uncertain-ties is not a priority, and we have performed studies to show that even the most optimistic reduction of systematic uncertainties can achieve at most a 10% improvement in the NMO sensitivity of this dataset [49]. The same study also showed that a removal of backgrounds (atmospheric muons and triggered noise) delivers at most a 5% improvement in sensitivity. In the coming years, a factor of four more statistics is expected from DeepCore (including both additional data and expected data-selection improvements), and this can result in a factor of two improvement in sensitivity. A more significant improvement that can be made is in the measurement resolutions: our studies [49] show that a 50% improvement in resolution on both neutrino direction and log 10 (E \u03bd ) would produce a factor of two improvement in the sensitivity of this dataset. To achieve an NMO determination in a reasonable timescale, a final necessary improvement is a lowering of the neutrino energy threshold; this, along with the improved resolutions, can be achieved by the PINGU concept [16,24] that reduces the energy threshold to below 10 GeV to enable a 3\u03c3 determination of the NMO for even the least optimistic values of the oscillation parameters.",
