High statistics measurements covering the data taking periods 1999-2000 and 2004-2007 are combined with previously published results in order to provide a single set of diffractive cross sections from the H1 experiment using the large rapidity gap selection method.

            "text": "Several theoretical QCD approaches have been proposed to interpret the dynamics of diffractive DIS. A general theoretical framework is provided by the QCD collinear factorisation theorem for semi-inclusive DIS cross sections such as that for ep \u2192 eXp [17,18]. This implies that the concept of diffractive parton distribution functions (DPDFs) may be introduced, representing conditional proton parton probability distributions under the constraint of a leading final state proton with a particular four-momentum. Empirically, an additional factorisation has been found to apply to good approximation, whereby the variables which describe the proton vertex factorise from those describing the hard interaction (proton vertex factorisation) [19,20]. The dependence of the DPDFs on the kinematic variables related to the proton vertex can be parametrised conveniently using Regge formalism, which amounts to a description of diffraction in terms of the exchange of a factorisable Pomeron (P) [21,22] with universal parton densities. Several authors have analysed diffractive DIS data to extract DPDFs [4,8,10,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34], with the conclusion that the data are compatible with proton vertex factorisation at low fractional proton energy losses, x P , and for photon virtualities Q 2 above \u223c5 GeV 2 . The DPDFs extracted in these publications consistently find a dominant gluon contribution. At larger x P The diffractive cross section can also be interpreted within the dipole model. In this picture, the virtual photon fluctuates into a colour singlet qq pair (or dipole) of transverse size r \u223c 1/Q, which subsequently undergoes a hard scattering with the proton [35][36][37][38][39][40]. In the low \u03b2 domain, it is expected that qq-g dipoles also contribute to inclusive diffraction [41]. In a recent unified saturation description of diffractive DIS good agreement with data has been obtained in the full Q 2 range down to \u223c3 GeV 2 [16]. This dipole model uses the parametrisation for the dipole scattering amplitude obtained in [42], which is an extension of the saturation model presented in [37] containing in addition heavyquark contributions. This approach is interesting because it relates the diffractive process, in the regime x P < 0.01 in which saturation is expected to be relevant, to the DIS inclusive process. The description of the diffractive process is obtained without extra parameter by considering the dipole cross section \u03c3 0 and the diffractive slope B D being directly related.",

This is based upon H1 data for which there is an absence of hadronic activity in a large rapidity region extending close to the outgoing proton beam direction. The data were recorded with the H1 detector in the years 1999-2000 and 2004-2007, when HERA collided protons of 920 GeV energy with 27.6 GeV electrons and positrons. The analysed data cover the low and medium Q 2 region from 3 to 105 GeV 2 . A combination with previous measurements obtained by H1, also using Large Rapidity Gap (LRG) events and based on low and medium Q 2 data from 1997 and high Q 2 data from 1999-2000 [10], is performed in order to provide a single set of diffractive cross sections for Q 2 up to 1600 GeV 2 . The results are compared with QCD calculations based on DPDFs extracted from previous H1 data [10] and with recent dipole model predictions [16].",

The Plug enables energy measurements to be made in the pseudorapidity range 3.5 < \u03b7 < 5.5. It is positioned around the beam-pipe at z = 4.9 m. The FMD consists of a series of drift chambers covering the range 1.9 < \u03b7 < 3.7.

All event samples are summarised in Table 1. 3.3 Event selection and kinematic reconstruction DIS events are selected by requiring a localised energy deposit (cluster) in the SpaCal calorimeter with an energy greater than 10 GeV, ensuring a trigger efficiency close to 100 %. The cluster radius of the electron candidate is required to be less than 4 cm, as expected for an electromagnetic shower. In order to avoid losses of energy into the beam-pipe, the radial distance between the beam axis and the cluster barycentre is required to be larger than 11 cm.

The ranges of sensitivity of the measurement in M Y and t are determined by the acceptances of the forward detectors which are used to identify the large rapidity gap. In order to keep the uncertainties arising from proton dissociation small and to ease comparisons with previous data [10], the measurement is integrated over the region M Y < 1.6 GeV, |t| < 1 GeV 2 .

Corrections for migrations in the kinematic variables due to the finite resolution are determined using MC programs. All generated MC events are passed through a detailed, GEANT [51] based, simulation of the H1 detector, which takes into account the running conditions of the different data taking periods, and are subject to the same reconstruction and analysis chain as used for data. Diffractive DIS is modelled using the RAPGAP Monte Carlo generator [52]. The RAPGAP event generator implements the exchange of a partonic Pomeron or meson with leading order QCD matrix elements. The Pomeron and meson fluxes and the parton distributions used in the event simulation are based on the DPDF fit to previous H1 data (H1 2006 DPDF Fit B) [10]. At low Q 2 , H1 2006 DPDF Fit B undershoots the data, as observed previously [10]. For Q 2 < 7 GeV 2 , RAPGAP is therefore reweighted by a parametrisation, depending on Q 2 and \u03b2, to describe the present data. Higher order QCD radiation is modelled using initial and final state parton showers in the approximation of leading logarithms [53]. Hadronisation is simulated using the Lund string model [54] as implemented in JET-SET [55]. QED radiative effects, including virtual loop corrections, are taken into account via an interface to the HER-ACLES program [56]. Migrations into the sample from the region M Y > 5 GeV are studied by using RAPGAP in the inclusive DIS mode. At low M X , where the presence of the meson resonances \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 becomes important, the DIF-FVM MC [48] is used in addition. The Monte Carlo program COMPTON [57] is used to simulate single dissociation and inelastic Bethe-Heitler events.",

Systematic uncertainties associated with detector modelling are treated as uncorrelated between data sets. Model systematic uncertainties on the acceptance and migration corrections are considered to be completely correlated between data sets. An overall normalisation uncertainty of 4 % is also considered as correlated between data sets. It corresponds to the fraction of the correction factor accounting for smearing about the M Y and t boundaries (see Sect. 3.3), whose determination method is common to all data sets. There are 597 data points averaged to 277 cross section measurements. The data from the different running periods show a reasonable consistency, with the total \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom (n dof ) of \u03c7 2 /n dof = 371/320. The adjustments of the relative normalisations are small, with the normalisation of the 1999 MB data set staying constant and the other data samples shifting by at most 1.3 %.

The resulting \u03b2 and Q 2 dependences are shown in Fig. 8. The results for all x P bins are also provided in numerical form in Tables 2 to 7 and in [61]. Statistical together with uncorrelated and point-to-point correlated systematic uncertainties are shown.   can be compared with other H1 measurements obtained by a direct measurement of the outgoing proton using the H1 Forward Proton Spectrometer (FPS) [12]. The cross section ep \u2192 eXY measured here with the LRG data includes proton dissociation to any system Y with a mass in the range M Y < 1.6 GeV, whereas in the cross section measured with the FPS the sys-tem Y is defined to be a proton. The FPS results are interpolated to the Q 2 , \u03b2 and x P bin centre values of the LRG data using a parametrisation of the H1 2006 DPDF Fit B. Only FPS data with interpolation corrections between 0.8 and 1.25 are used. The ratio of the two measurements is then formed for each (Q 2 , \u03b2, x P ) point for x P = 0.01 and x P = 0.03, at which both LRG and FPS data are available. The FPS data set covers only the 2004-2007 running period whilst the LRG data also includes cross sections from 1997, Fig. 6 The \u03b2 dependence of the reduced diffractive cross section, multiplied by x P , at a fixed value of x P = 0.01, resulting from the combination of all data samples. Details are explained in the caption of Fig. 3 1999 MB and 1999-2000 running periods, for x P = 0.01 and only 1997 data for x P = 0.03. The two LRG and FPS data sets are therefore statistically independent to a large extent. As also the dominant sources of systematic errors in the two data sets are different, correlations between the uncertainties on the FPS and LRG data are neglected.

In Fig. 9 the combined LRG cross section measurements as a function of Q 2 are compared with the interpolated FPS data rescaled by a factor 1.2, following the above determination. A good agreement between the two measurements is observed. The combined H1 LRG cross section are also compared with the most recent measurements by the ZEUS experiment using a similar LRG selection [14]. These ZEUS diffractive data have been determined for identical \u03b2 and x P values, but at different Q 2 values to H1. In order to match the M Y < 1.6 GeV range of the H1 data, a global factor of 0.91 \u00b1 0.07 [14] is applied to the ZEUS LRG data. The comparison for M Y < 1.6 GeV between the H1 data and the rescaled ZEUS data is shown in Fig. 10. The ZEUS data tend to remain higher than those of H1 by \u223c10 % on average. This difference in normalisation is consistent with the 8 % uncertainty on the proton-dissociation correction factor of 0.91 \u00b1 0.07 applied to ZEUS data combined with the normalisation uncertainties of the two data sets of 4 % (H1) and 2.25 % (ZEUS). This normalisation difference is also similar to that of 0.85 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(sys.) +0.09 \u22120.12 (norm.) between the H1 FPS and the ZEUS LPS tagged-proton data sets [12].

Therefore, only an extrapolation of the DPDFs predictions to this kinematic domain is indicated as dashed lines in these figures. In Fig. 10 the data are compared also with predictions of the dipole model [16].  As the dipole model predictions correspond to the process ep \u2192 eXp, they are rescaled by a factor of 1.20 according to Eq. (9).

Assuming proton vertex factorization in the DPDF approach, this ratio is expected to be independent of Q 2 and depends only weakly on \u03b2 and x Q 2 /W 2 for sufficiently large M X . A remaining weak x dependence of the ratio may arise due to deviations from unity of the intercept of the Pomeron trajectory, which are studied in the next section. The ratio (10) is shown in Fig. 11 as a function of x at fixed x P and Q 2 values. The ratio of the diffractive to the inclusive cross section is found to be approximately constant with x at fixed Q 2 and x P except towards larger x values which correspond to large \u03b2 values. This indicates that the ratio of quark to gluon distributions is similar in the diffractive and inclusive process when considered at the same low x value. The ratio is also larger at high values of x P , x P = 0.03, where the sub-leading exchange contribution of the diffractive cross section is not negligible, but it remains approximately constant with x. These observations are in agreement with previous similar studies [12]. The general behaviour of the ratio, and especially its decrease towards larger x, is reproduced by both the DPDF [10] and dipole model [16] predictions.  [15]. The diffractive structure function can be investigated in the framework of Regge phenomenology and is usually expressed as a sum of two factorised contributions corresponding to Pomeron and secondary Reggeon trajectories",

            "text": "In previous publications [4,11,12,14], it has already been shown that fits of this form provide a good description of the data. This supports the proton vertex factorisation hypothesis whereby the x P and t dependences are decoupled from the Q 2 and \u03b2 dependences for each of the Pomeron and sub-leading contributions. This global conclusion can be refined using the advantage of the improved statistical precision of the present analysis. In the following, the full range in Q 2 is divided into six intervals: Q 2 \u2264 6.5 GeV 2 , 6.5 < Q 2 \u2264 12 GeV 2 , 12 < Q 2 \u2264 25 GeV 2 , 25 < Q 2 \u2264 45 GeV 2 , 45 < Q 2 \u2264 90 GeV 2 and Q 2 > 90 GeV 2 . For each interval i, a free Pomeron intercept \u03b1 P (0)[Q 2 i ] is introduced. Thus the factorisation assumption can be tested differentially in Q 2 by allowing for a Q 2 dependence of the Pomeron intercept in the fit procedure. In the minimisation procedure the error of each data points is obtained by adding in quadrature the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. The effect of correlated uncertainties is taken into account by repeating the fit multiple times with each correlated systematic error shifted by one standard deviation. The kinematic domain of the fit procedure is defined as M X > 2 GeV and \u03b2 < 0.8, in order to avoid resonances and potential higher-twist effects. This leads to 175 diffractive structure function values. The fit provides a good description of the data (\u03c7 2 = 201). The results on the Pomeron intercept are presented in Fig. 12. No significant Q 2 dependence of the Fig. 12 Pomeron intercept values obtained from Regge fits in different Q 2 bins, as defined in the text (dots). The inner error bars represent the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature and the outer error bars include model uncertainties in addition (see text for details). Previous determinations of the Pomeron intercept [10][11][12]14] are also displayed for comparison. For these previous results the bands or boxes represent the combination of experimental and model uncertainties, always dominated by the model error Pomeron intercept is observed, which supports the proton vertex factorisation hypothesis.The average value is found to be \u03b1 P (0) = 1.113 \u00b1 0.002 (exp.) +0.029 \u22120.015 (model),",

New results are obtained using high statistics data taken from 1999 to 2007 by the H1 detector at HERA. These measurements are combined with previous H1 results obtained using the same technique for the selection of large rapidity gap events. The combined data span more than two orders of magnitude in Q 2 from 3.5 GeV 2 to 1600 GeV 2 and cover the range 0.0017 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 0.8 for five fixed values of x P in the range 0.0003 \u2264 x P \u2264 0.03. In the best measured region for Q 2 \u2265 12 GeV 2 , the statistical and systematic uncertainties are at the level of 1 % and 5 %, respectively, with an additional overall normalisation uncertainty of 4 %.

The corresponding uncertainty is evaluated by varying the amount of calorimeter energy classified as noise by 10 %. This level of precision is determined by comparing the calorimeter noise subtracted in the data with that in the Monte Carlo model, which includes a simulation of noise based on randomly triggered events. \u2022 The efficiency with which the FMD registers activity when there is hadronic energy flow in its acceptance region is varied in the simulation by 5 % for 1999-2000 and 4 % for 2004-2007. For the PRT and FTS, this efficiency is varied by 20 % and 7 %, respectively. The Plug energy scale is varied by 10 %. These levels of uncertainty are obtained by comparison of the present data with the Monte Carlo simulation for samples in which forward detector activity is required. \u2022 The model dependences of the acceptance and migration corrections and of the background subtractions are estimated by varying the details of the Monte Carlo simulation within the limits permitted by the present data. In the RAPGAP simulation of diffraction, the x P distribution is reweighted by (1/x P ) \u00b10.05 , the \u03b2 distribution by \u03b2 \u00b10.05 and (1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u00b10.05 , the t distribution by e \u00b1t[12] and the Q 2 distribution by (log Q 2 ) \u00b10.2 . The reweighting in t and (1 \u2212 \u03b2) are found to have a negligible effect on the measured cross sections. For Q 2 < 7 GeV 2 , an additional uncertainty on the shape of the \u03b2 distribution is introduced to account for the poor description of the data by RAPGAP in this phase space region. This results in an additional uncertainty below 1 % on the measured cross sections. The normalisation of the sub-leading meson exchange in RAPGAP is varied by \u00b125 % and that of the vector meson production simulation (DIFFVM) is varied by \u00b150 %. The uncertainty in the background from high M Y , as simulated by the inclusive RAPGAP MC, is taken to be 100 %. These normalisation uncertainties are determined in this analysis by comparing MC predictions to data in alternative event selections. \u2022 The model dependence of the bin centre corrections is estimated by comparing the results obtained using the H1 2006 DPDF Fit A and Fit B sets. It results in a sizeable correlated uncertainty of up to 3 % only at the largest \u03b2 values.",
