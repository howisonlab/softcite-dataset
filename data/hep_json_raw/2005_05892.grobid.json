They can be produced directly in e + e \u2212 colliding experiments, such as CLEO, Babar, and Belle, with low continuum backgrounds. In these experiments, many measurements of the exclusive \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays into light hadrons, which shed light on the \"80% rule\" for the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka suppressed decays in the bottomonium sector, were carried out. Meanwhile, many studies of the charmonium and bottomonium productions in \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) decays were performed, to distinguish different Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) models. Besides, exotic states and new physics were also extensively explored in \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) decays at CLEO, BaBar, and Belle. The \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) states can also be produced in pp collisions and in collisions involving heavy ions. The precision measurements of their cross sections and polarizations at the large hadron collider (LHC), especially in the CMS, ATLAS, and LHCb experiments, help to understand \u03a5 production mechanisms in pp collisions. The observation of the sequential \u03a5 suppression in heavy ion collisions at CMS, LHCb, and ALICE is of great importance for verifying the quark-gluon plasma predicted by QCD. In this article, we review the experimental results on \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) at e + e \u2212 colliders and the LHC, and summarize their prospects at Belle II and the LHC.",

Soon, in the e + e \u2212 collisions to the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state, \u03a5(1S) was confirmed, and \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) were also observed [3,4,5]. The discovery of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) opens a door to the study of the bottomonium spectrum. In the following decades many different experiments, at lepton, hadron, and ion colliders, reported the fruitful results on these \u03a5 states.",

This can be explained by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rules [7,8,9,10]. For \u03a5(4S) and other \u03a5 states with higher masses, they are allowed to decay via a typical strong interaction into a pair of heavy quark mesons: (bb) \u2192 (bq)(qb) (q = u, d, c), e.g., \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB, which results in a large natural width. Below the BB threshold, \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) can not decay via this OZI-favored way, thus leading to a narrow natural width. However, they can still decay by strong interactions with the bb pair annihilation via three gluons into hadrons.",

Accordingly, a particularly clean environment for studies of the properties of the \u03a5 states is provided by e + e \u2212 colliders at B-factories (Belle and BaBar) and CLEO. The hadronic and radiative decays of the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) resonances have been extensively studied at B-factories and CLEO to test various theoretical predictions by potential models [11,12,13,14,15,16], effective field approaches [17,18], lattice gauge calculations [19,20], etc. The bottomonium spectroscopy has also been greatly enriched in the past decades.",

A precise measurement of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) production cross sections is thus crucial for distinguishing these models. Thanks to the good momentum resolutions of the detectors, the experiments at the LHC, especially the CMS, ATLAS, and LHCb experiments, have the ability to distinguish the three \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) structures in the dimuon decay channel.

If QGP is formed in heavy-ion collisions, it is expected to screen the confining potential of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, leading to the melting of charmonia and bottomonia [28]. The dissociation of the quarkonium states depends on the temperature of the medium, and is expected to occur sequentially, along the increasing values of their binding energies [29]. For example, the loosely bound states \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) are more likely to unbind than the tightly bound state \u03a5(1S). Up to now, the pattern of QGP in \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) states has been established at CMS, LHCb, and ALICE by observing a sequential suppression of their yields in P bP b and pP b collisions.",

With regard to e + e \u2212 colliders, we discuss the hadronic and radiative decays of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S), especially those for exotic states and NP, and the transitions between the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) and other \u03a5 states with higher masses. Several effective models of QCD were compared with and challenged by these measurements. The \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) cross sections and polarizations in pp collisions were studied at the LHC. The QGP formation predicted by QCD was probed by comparing the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) yields from different types of collisions.",

The recent results of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 gg\u03b3 were given by CLEO [34] in the measurements of the direct photon momentum spectrum. The signal yield of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 gg\u03b3 is determined in the x \u03b3 = p \u03b3 /E beam spectrum after excluding all possible backgrounds, where p \u03b3 is the momentum of the isolated photon in the e + e \u2212 C.M. frame, and E beam is the beam energy. Two main backgrounds are photons that come from initial state radiation (ISR), which are the dominant background at the highest photon energy (x \u03b3 > 0.65), while at lower energies (x \u03b3 < 0.65) the dominant background comes from photons resulting from \u03c0 0 decays. The ISR background is well simulated by the jetset \uf737 . \uf734 [37] event generator. A data-driven method is used to estimate the background contribution from \u03c0 0 decays. Continuum processes have been subtracted using an off-resonance data sample. By importing the branching fractions of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 ggg from PDG [6], the R \u03b3 ratios are obtained to be R \u03b3 (1S) = (2.70 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.24)%, R \u03b3 (2S) = (3.18 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.41)%, and R \u03b3 (3S) = (2.72 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b1 0.37)%, where the first, second, and third uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and theoretical model dependent [38,39,40,41], respectively. Hereinafter if there are two and more uncertainties in the formulae, the first one is statistical and the second is systematic. The above values of R \u03b3 (1S), R \u03b3 (2S), and R \u03b3 (3S) imply the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s = 0.1114 \u00b1 0.0002 \u00b1 0.0029 \u00b1 0.0053, 0.1026 \u00b1 0.0007 \u00b1 0.0041 \u00b1 0.0077, and 0.113 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b1 0.0007 \u00b1 0.008 at the \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and \u03a5(3S) resonances, respectively [34]. Considering the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s can be written as a function of the QCD scale parameter \u039b M S , defined in the modified minimal subtraction scheme [6], we can determine the value of \u039b M S further.",

With a larger \u03a5(1S) data sample, Belle reported B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + anything) = (5.25 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03c8 + anything) = (1.23 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , with substantially improved precisions [57]. The differential branching fractions of \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays into J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 are shown  [49,50] and measurements using CLEO data [51]. Here, the uncertainties include statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

The cross sections of the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b7 c , J/\u03c8\u03b7 c (2S), \u03c8 \u03b7 c , \u03c8 \u03b7 c (2S), J/\u03c8\u03c7 c0 , and \u03c8 \u03c7 c0 measured by Belle [59,60] and BaBar [61] exceeded the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) calculations by approximately an order of magnitude [62,63,64,65,66,67]. Taking into account the next-to-leading order (NLO) correction to NRQCD, the discrepancy between theory and experiment can be largely removed [68,69]. Inspired by the unexpectedly high double-charmonium production in e + e \u2212 annihilation, interest has turned to the double charmonium states produced in bottomonium decays. Comprehensive studies of the exclusive decay of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) into double charmonia have been performed using the NRQCD factorization approach [70,71]. The branching fractions are predicted to be of order 10 \u22126 for \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 J/\u03c8(\u03c8 ) + \u03b7 c (\u03b7 c (2S)) [70]. For the J/\u03c8 + \u03c7 c0 /\u03c7 c1 /\u03c7 c2 decay modes, the branching fractions are calculated at the lowest order; that of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03c7 c1 is the largest, about a few times 10 \u22126 , while that of J/\u03c8 + \u03c7 c2 is only of order 10 \u22127 [71].",

Unlike the previous Belle analysis using the \u03a5(1S) data sample [73], the authors use the \u03a5(2S) data sample and tag \u03a5(1S) via the \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transition. Although the number of tagged \u03a5(1S) events is several times smaller than the number of directly produced \u03a5(1S) events used in the previous analysis, the tagging procedure drastically suppresses the backgrounds, especially those from the processes with ISR or final-state radiation (FSR), which have an event topology similar to that of the signal. Moreover, two extra pion tracks increase a   trigger efficiency for low-multiplicity final states of the charmonium decay. In order to estimate the statistical significance of the observed signal, a simultaneous unbinned likelihood fit to \u03b3J/\u03c8 mass spectra in M rec (the mass recoiling against a pion pair) signal, and J/\u03c8 and M rec sidebands regions is performed, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The fit yields the number of signal events to be 5.0 +2.5 \u22121.9 , and the estimated background contribution in the signal region is less than 0.1. The significance of the \u03c7 c1 signal is 7.5\u03c3. Finally, the branching fraction is calculated to be B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 ) = (4.7 +2.4",

Later, Belle used 74 hadronic final states to reconstruct \u03c7 bJ (1P ) states, where 41 modes are observed with at least five standard deviation significance [98]. These measurements enriched the understanding of the \u03c7 bJ states. Belle searched for the first time for double charmonium decays of \u03c7 bJ states (\u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ , \u03c7 bJ \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8\u03c8 , \u03c8 \u03c8 ) [99]. No significant \u03c7 bJ signal is observed in the double charmonium mass spectra. The upper limits at 90% C.L. on the branching fractions of \u03c7 bJ decays were determined to be at the level of 10 \u22125 , except for B(\u03c7 c0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c8 ) < 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . These upper limits are much lower than the central values predicted by the light cone formalism [100,101] and pQCD calculation [102], but are consistent with calculations using the NRQCD factorization approach [103,104].",

Two 0 \u2212\u2212 glueballs are predicted using QCD sum  rules [122] with masses of (3.81 \u00b1 0.12) GeV/c 2 and (4.33\u00b10.13) GeV/c 2 , and a 0 \u2212\u2212 glueball calculated using the dynamical holographic QCD model has a mass of 3.817 GeV/c 2 [123]. Belle searched for such [58]. No evident signal is found at the predicted masses in all the studied processes, and 90% C.L. upper limits are set on their branching fractions. As an example, Fig. 13 shows the 90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fractions of \u03a5(1S)/\u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 + G 0 \u2212\u2212 as a function of the G 0 \u2212\u2212 width. Interestingly, a signal at 3.92 GeV/c 2 is evident in \u03a5(1S) \u2192 f 1 (1285)+G 0 \u2212\u2212 with a significance of 3.7\u03c3, which is consistent with the prediction in Ref. [122] within uncertainty.",

            "text": "\u2022 Search for six-quark states in \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) decays While the vast majority of known hadrons can be described as either quark-antiquark, three-quark, or three-antiquark combinations, other possibilities are allowed by QCD. Among those, the six-quark configuration uuddss is of particular interest, as its spatial wave function is completely symmetric. Generic arguments imply that it should be the most tightly bound six-quark state [126]. This property was already noticed by Jaffe in 1977 [127]. He predicted the existence of a loosely bound uuddss state with a mass below the 2m \u039b threshold by about 80 MeV/c 2 , dubbed the H dibaryon. Recently, the motivation to search for H has been strengthened by lattice QCD [128,129,130] and chiral constituent model calculations [131]. With its mass approaching the 2m \u039b threshold from be- low (above), H would behave more and more like a \u039b\u039b analog of deuteron (dineutron), independent of its dynamical origin [132]. If its mass is below 2m \u039b , H would predominantly decay via \u2206S = +1 weak transitions to the \u039bn, \u03a3 \u2212 p, \u03a3 0 n or \u039bp\u03c0 \u2212 final states. If its mass is above 2m \u039b , but below A stable sexaquark, denoted as S, with the sixquark uuddss component was proposed to be discovered in \u03a5 \u2192 S\u039b\u039b decays [134]. If S really exists, then S is a good DM candidate. BaBar investigated such a state in \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) decays [135]. Considering the S is undetected, the total energy of clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter not associated with charged particles, E extra , is required to be less than 0.5 GeV to remove hadronic events containing several strange baryons and additional charged and neutral particles. The mass of the unseen S can be identified with the square of the mass recoiling against the \u039b\u039b system. As a result, no significant signal is observed, and 90% C.L. upper limits on the \u03a5(2S, 3S) \u2192 S\u039b\u039b branching fractions, scanning S masses in the range 0 < m S < 2.05 GeV/c 2 in steps of 50 MeV/c 2 (approximately half the signal resolution), are derived, which are shown in Fig. 15 for the \u03a5(2S, 3S) datasets, as well as the combined sample assuming the same partial width. These results set stringent bounds on the existence of the S state. ",

For the selection of the invisible decay candidates, two oppositely charged tracks \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are required in the event. Considering the products from \u03a5(1S) decay may go outside of the detector acceptance, the recoil mass distribution against two pions in \u03a5(3S) data, M recoil \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , still peaks at the \u03a5(1S) mass and becomes a peaking background to the invisible decay signal. Expected numbers of peaking background events based on MC calculations for \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , e + e \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , and \u03bd\u03bd are 77.3\u00b112.0, 50.3\u00b18.2, 5.2\u00b1 1.0, and 0.4\u00b10.1 assuming the world-average values of B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 /e + e \u2212 /\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) from PDG [6], and B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) = (9.9 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [21]. Figure 16 shows the M recoil \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution. The extracted signal yield, 38 \u00b1 39 events, is consistent with zero. The dot-dashed line shows the expected signal for B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7) = 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [22]. The resulting B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 invisible) < 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 was obtained at 90% C.L. This result disfavors the prediction in Ref. [22] for the \u03a5(1S) decay to a pair of DM particles lighter than the b quark. CLEO [137] and BaBar [138] also measured the branching fraction of the invisible \u03a5(1S) decay.

Since the mass of A 0 is unknown, two processes are considered: the on-shell process \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 with A 0 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7; and the off-shell process \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7\u03c7. The \u03a5(1S) is tagged via the dipion transition \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Both signal processes produce only three detectable particles: two charged pions, which have low transverse momenta, and a photon, which has the highest energy in the C.M. frame. Two observables are used to extract the signals: the invariant recoil mass of the dipion system (M recoil ) and the energy of photon in the \u03a5(1S) frame (E * \u03b3 ). Distributions of M recoil and E * \u03b3 are shown in Fig. 17. Irreducible backgrounds can be categorized into four event types: tau-pair productions \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , continuum, leptonic decays \u03a5(1S) \u2192 + \u2212 , and hadronic decays \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3hh. Tau-pair productions from the \u03a5(2S) and continuum backgrounds do not peak either in the recoil mass distribution nor in the photon energy spectrum; therefore, they are combined, as shown by the cyan dashed curve in Fig. 17. The background contributions from leptonic decays and hadronic decays of \u03a5(1S) are predicted to be 20.0 \u00b1 2.8 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.7 events, which are combined as shown by the magenta dashed curves in Fig. 17.",

Effective field theory allows one to relate the above fractions to the mass scale \u039b \u03c4 of LFV beyond the SM physics using \u03b1 2 [158,159], where denotes e or \u00b5, \u03b1 l\u03c4 is the NP coupling constant, q b = \u22121/3 is the charge of b quark, and \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b1(m \u03a5(nS) ) is the fine structure constant at the \u03a5(nS) mass. Assuming \u03b1 e\u03c4 = \u03b1 \u00b5\u03c4 = 1, the branching fractions above can be translated to the 90% C.L. lower limits \u039b e\u03c4 > 1.6 TeV and \u039b \u00b5\u03c4 > 1.7 TeV from BaBar [157], and the 95% C.L. lower limit \u039b \u00b5\u03c4 > 1.34 TeV from CLEO [156].",

It has succeeded in explaining the hadronic transitions between charmonia, e.g., the relative rate of \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 to \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [161]. It also predicts that the transitions between bottomonium states involving an \u03b7 or \u03c0 0 meson are highly suppressed, since they require a spin flip of the heavy quark [160,162,163].",

            "text": "The experiments at the LHC have different features in detecting muons. At LHCb, muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [174,175]. The trigger system of LHCb consists of a hardware stage based on information from the muon systems, followed by a software stage, which employs a full event reconstruction [176]. With high trigger efficiencies and good resolutions, the measurements consisting muon final states at LHCb are very promising. ATLAS [177] and CMS [178] own the muon spectrometers equipped with drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers (CMS only). Owing to a larger magnetic field intensity (2 T at ATLAS and 3.8 T at CMS) and extra resistive plate chambers, the performances on the efficiency and resolution for muons at CMS, especially in the low momentum region, are better than those at ATLAS. The muon identification at ALICE utilizes a front absorber and an iron wall located between the tracking and trigger systems [179]. The performances on the efficiency and resolution for muons at AL-ICE are not very good compared to LHCb, AT-LAS, and CMS. The features of the performances in \u03a5 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 measurements at the LHC are shown in Table 5, which are summarized from the related public webs at CERN [173], technical design reports [174,175,176,177,178,179], and published papers [180,181,182,183]. We note that, the rapidity, transverse momentum, and resolution denote the related parameters of \u03a5, while the trigger efficiency applies to a single muon.",

Using a pp collision data sample of 1.8 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV, ATLAS measured the production cross sections of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) mesons in a larger momentum region of p T < 70 GeV/c and in the rapidity interval of y < 2.25 [181]. Figure 25 shows the measured differential cross sections of \u03a5(1S) as a function of p T , in comparison with theoretical calculations. By varying the spin-alignment assumption from the nominal isotropic assumption for muons, the derived difference is shown by the cyan bands in Fig 25. The predictions from the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCDbased calculations using the color-singlet mechanism (CSM) [189,190,191,192,193,194] and the color evaporation model (CEM) [195,196,197,198,199,200] are indicated by the orange bands and cross hatched violet bands. Apparently, the discrepancy between the predictions from CSM and data points is large if one extends the CSM calculations to the higher p T region. It is probably because CSM does not take into account the \u03a5 productions that arise from higher \u03a5 or \u03c7 bJ (nP ) decays, which mostly occur at modest rates.",

The \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) differential cross sections times dimuon branching fractions for |y| < 1.2 are shown in Fig. 26. The results are consistent with the measurements within p T < 70 GeV/c by ATLAS [181]. The solid lines are the NLO NRQCD color-octet calculations from Ref. [202] and extended by the authors to cover the range p T < 100 GeV/c. A similar measurement [203] was performed using a data set of 2.7 fb \u22121 , but at a higher energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. In order to perform the measurement in a kinematical region where muon acceptance is high, the requirements are applied as p \u00b5 T > 4.5 GeV/c for |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 0.3 and p \u00b5 T > 4.0 GeV/c for 0.3 < |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 1.4. Figure 27 shows the differential cross sections times dimuon branching fractions for 13 TeV CMS data, together with a comparison of the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) differential cross sections for the 7 and 13 TeV data sets. The differential cross sections times dimuon branching fractions for 13 TeV are well described by NLO NRQCD [204,205]. The cross sections of all the three \u03a5 states at 13 TeV are factors of 2 to 3 larger than the corresponding cross sections at 7 TeV, changing slowly as a function of p T .",

The differential cross sections times dimuon branching fractions as functions of p T and y were presented in Ref. [206]. The theoretical predictions, based on the NLO NRQCD calculation [26], provide a good description of the data in the higher kinematic region. The products of the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) cross sections and dimuon branching fractions in the regions of p T < 15 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5, assuming unpolarised production, are listed in Table 7. The results at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV are approximately half of those at \u221a s = 7 TeV [182]. These results, together with the comparison between \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s =13 TeV from CMS [203], provide useful information for characterizing the s-dependence of \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) cross sections in pp collisions.

In the HX frame, the z axis is defined as the direction of the \u03a5 momentum in the C.M. frame of the colliding protons. In the CS frame, the z axis is defined such that it bisects the angle between p 1 and \u2212 p 2 in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson, where p 1 and p 2 are the three-momenta of the colliding protons in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson.

The measurements were performed in three polarization frames: HX, CS, and Gottfried-Jackson (GJ) [216] frames. In the GJ frame, the z axis is defined as the direction of p 1 in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson. The bottomonium states are heavier and approximately non-relativistic systems, allowing the application of theoretical tools that simplify and constrain the analyses of nonperturbative effects [46,47]. However, the corresponding predictions [217] of strong transverse polarizations are in stark contrast with the negligible polarizations observed by the experiments [212,213,214,215]. Accordingly, the measurements of \u03a5 polarization have led to new theoretical interpretations for the quarkonium puzzle. For instance, in Ref. [218], global fits using both cross section and polarization measurements are performed to determine the nonperturbative parameters of bound-state formation. This study reveals unexpected hierarchies in the phenomenological long-distance parameters, which brings a new understanding of the bound-state formation mechanism in QCD.",

            "text": "The first indication of \u03a5 suppression in heavy ion collisions was reported by CMS at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [219]. The integrated luminosity used in this measurement corresponds to 7.28 \u00b5b \u22121 for P bP b and 225 nb \u22121 for pp collisions, the latter corresponding approximately to the equivalent nucleonnucleon luminosity of the P bP b run. Thanks to the good momentum resolution of the CMS detector, the three \u03a5 resonances in the dimuon mass spectrum can be well resolved. The same reconstruction algorithm and analysis criteria are applied to both data sets. The results are shown in Fig. 30, where the three \u03a5 peaks are clearly observed in the pp case, but \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) are not significant in the P bP b case. The suppression effects for \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) in P bP b collisions are more obvious than that for \u03a5(1S). The ratio on the production rates of \u03a5(2S + 3S) and \u03a5(1S) in P bP b and pp collisions can be derived according to the \u03a5(2S + 3S) and \u03a5(1S) signal yields directly since the acceptance and efficiency differences among the reconstructed resonances are cancelled. An extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the two invariant mass distributions of Fig. 30 gives the double ratio of the In 2011, CMS collected a number of pp and P bP b data samples at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV to measure the sequential \u03a5 suppression [220]. The total integrated luminosity of the data samples is 150 \u00b5b \u22121 , which is approximately 20 times larger than those used in Ref. [219]. The resultant dimuon invariant mass spectra are shown in Fig. 31 for the pp and P bP b datasets. The three \u03a5 peaks are clearly observed in the pp case; the \u03a5(3S) peak is not prominent in the P bP b case. The simultaneous fit to the dimuon invariant mass spectra in the P bP b and pp datasets gives the double ratios of the observed signal yields The measured values are considerably smaller than unity. The significance of the observed suppression exceeds 5\u03c3.",

The double ratio for \u03a5(2S) was studied as a function of collision centrality, as well as the \u03a5 transverse momentum and rapidity, as shown in Fig. 33. Predictions of \u03a5 suppression from Krouppa and Strickland [223], incorporating color-screening effects on the bottomonium family and reflecting feed-down contributions from decays of heavy quarkonia, are in overall agreement with the \u03a5(2S) double ratio results presented in Fig. 33. In this model, the dynamical evolution is treated using anisotropic hydrodynamics, where the relevant initial conditions are changed by varying the viscosity to entropy ratio, \u03b7/s, and the initial momentum-space anisotropy. Another theoretical curve from Du et al. in Ref. [224], based on a kinetic-rate equation approach and containing a small component of regenerated bottomonia, shows a similar level of agreement with the data. No significant variations with p T (middle) or |y| (right) in Fig. 33 are observed. Predictions of \u03a5 suppression as functions of p T [223,224] and |y| [223] are in overall agreement with the data.  Fig. 34. AL-ICE has no ability to measure the cross sections of \u03a5 in pp collisions. Therefore, they applied an interpolation method utilizing the LHCb measurements in Ref. [206]. From Fig. 34, R AA decreases with increasing centrality, and no significant dependencies on p T and y are seen. The suppressions of the \u03a5(1S) state on the centrality and y at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV are slightly weaker than those measured at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, which is not consistent with our expectations since the bound state is more likely to dissolve at higher temperatures. Two transport models (TM1 and TM2) [224,226] and one hydro-dynamical model [227] are compared with data points. Though TM1 and TM2 use different rate equations, both of them take account of the feed-down contributions from higher-mass bottomonia to \u03a5(1S). Deviation between TM1 (TM2) and data is 2\u03c3 (1.4\u03c3). The trends of R AA as a function of centrality, p T , and y can be described by the hydro-dynamical model to some extent.",

Using a P bP b collision data sample of 750 \u00b5b \u22121 at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV, ALICE performed the first measurement of the \u03bd 2 coefficient of \u03a5(1S) in the forward rapidity region of 2.5 < y < 4 [229]. The \u03a5 mesons are reconstructed via their \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channel. The dimuon \u03bd 2 coefficient was determined using    the scalar product method [230,231], correlating the reconstructed dimuons with the second-order harmonic event flow vector [228,232]. Figure 35 shows the graph of \u03bd 2 (M \u00b5\u00b5 ) as well as the fitted result, where a negative yield around \u03a5(1S) mass is observed. Here, only 5%\u221260% centrality interval is considered since the eccentricity of the initial collision geometry is small for the central collision (0%\u22125%), and the signal yield is low for the peripheral collision (60%\u2212100%). Figure 36 shows the \u03bd 2 coefficient of \u03a5(1S) as a function of transverse momentum. The results are compatible with 0 and consistent with the small positive values predicted by the available theoretical models within uncertainties. The values of \u03bd 2 for \u03a5(1S) are lower than those for J/\u03c8 by 2.6 standard deviations, which indicates the limited dissociation for \u03a5(1S) in the early P bP b collision stage, and an additional regeneration component needed for J/\u03c8.",

Therefore, it is necessary to study \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) productions in pP b collisions in order to study the CNM effect separately. This knowledge can be extrapolated into P bP b collisions so that the fraction of the suppression due to HNM in P bP b collisions can be determined [234].",

            "text": "The \u03a5 suppressions in pP b collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV were investigated by CMS [235], LHCb [236], and ALICE [237], using data samples of 31 nb \u22121 , 1.6 nb \u22121 , and 10.82 nb \u22121 , respectively. The studied rapidity intervals in CMS, LHCb, and ALICE are |y| < 1.93, \u22125 < y < \u22122.5 (backward) && 1.5 < y < 4.0 (forward), and \u22124.46 < y < \u22122.96 (backward) && 2.03 < y < 3.53 (forward), respectively. By utilizing the results in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, CMS gave the pP b double ratios, which are shown in Fig. 37, together with their counterparts in P bP b collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV for comparison. Clearly, the pP b ratios are much larger than the corresponding P bP b ratios [220]. The nuclear modification R AA as a function of rapidity y was determined by LHCb [236] and ALICE [237] in both of their forward and backward regions, where the input cross sections of \u03a5 in pp collisions were obtained by a power-law interpolation from LHCb measurements [182,206,238]. The resulting R AA distributions are shown in Fig. 38 with the calculations from several theoretical models. The values of R AA for \u03a5(1S) in the forward region from LHCb and forward and backward regions from ALICE are below 1, while the value of R AA for \u03a5(1S) in the backward region from LHCb is above 1. The blue band in Fig. 38 (left) shows the predicted results based on CSM at LO with EPS09 corrected parameter [239]. The calculation based on CEM at LO with EPS09 [240] is shown by the blue band in Fig. 38 (right). The parton energy loss calculations with and without EPS09 at NLO [241] are shown by green and red bands in Fig. 38 (right), respectively. All of the above theoretical predictions [239,240,241] favor the LHCb result that the value of R AA in the backward region is at least 1. The nuclear modification factors measured from LHCb also deliver information that the suppression for \u03a5(1S) is smaller than that for J/\u03c8. The \u03a5 suppressions in pP b collisions at a higher C.M. energy, i.e. \u221a s = 8.16 TeV were studied by LHCb [242] and ALICE [243]. Particularly, the \u03a5 suppression performances with increasing transverse momentum p T were intensively investigated. Figure 39 shows the nuclear modification factor R AA for \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) as a function of p T in both the forward and backward regions. From the figure, the values of R AA increase with p T . The similar trends were also found in the R AA measurements from ALICE [243], as shown in Fig. 40. The predictions with EPPS16 [244,245,246,247] and nCTEQ15 [248,249,250], as two different nuclear parton distribution functions, are used to compare the experimental results. The calculations based on EPS09 NLO [251,252] are also used to compare the ALICE result, as shown by the red bands in Fig. 40. A good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions is found in the forward region for both \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S). While in the backward region, the values of R AA in data are mostly less than 1, different from theoretical predictions. Overall, the suppression effects are seen in pP b collisions, but much smaller than those in P bP b collisions, which indicates the presence of the CNM effect. Such contributions can make small corrections to the complete HNM suppression effects in P bP b collisions.",

The measurements of these cross sections and polarizations have shed light on the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) production mechanisms in pp collisions. Analysis of new LHC data will extend the reach of the kinematics to test the NRQCD with higher-order corrections which becomes more sensitive with the increase of p T .

With the increased collision energy and detector capability, CMS, LHCb, and ALICE have established the pattern of sequential \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) suppression in collisions involving heavy ions, where the excited states are more suppressed than the ground state. Besides, they proved that the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) suppression increases with the collision centrality and energy, and does not change along with the transverse momentum or rapidity. In addition to P bP b collisions, the \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) suppression was also studied in pP b collisions by CMS, LHCb, and ALICE to distinguish the non-HNM effects in the QGP formation. The slight \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) suppression observed in pP b collisions implies that both HNM and CNM can influence the QGP formation. In the future, the large datasets collected at the LHC will be used to explore the sequential suppression of P -wave bottomonia.
