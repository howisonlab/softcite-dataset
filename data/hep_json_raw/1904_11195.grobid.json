Nonetheless, new physical processes could potentially violate parity in ways which are detectable by those same experiments. If those sources of new physics occur only at LHC energies, they are untested by direct searches. We probe the feasibility of such measurements using approximately 0.2 fb \u22121 of data which was recorded in 2012 by the CMS collaboration and made public within the CMS Open Data initiative. In particular, we test an inclusive three-jet event selection which is primarily sensitive to non-standard parity violating effects in quark-gluon interactions. Within our measurements, no significant deviation from the Standard Model is seen and no obvious experimental limitations have been found. We discuss other ways that searches for non-standard parity violation could be performed, noting that these would be sensitive to very different sorts of models to those which our method would constrain. We hope that our initial studies provide a valuable starting point for rigorous future analyses using the full LHC datasets at 13 TeV with a careful and less conservative estimate of experimental uncertainties.",

For example, the differences between the axial and vector couplings of the Z-boson in the Standard Model violate parity and were measured in [5,6]. However, neither of these papers incontrovertibly demonstrates that nature violates parity. The reason is simple: the angles from which forward-backward asymmetries are calculated are even under parity, unlike primary observables from the experiments of the 1950s. The very same forward backward asymmetries could therefore also be explained, at least in principle, by some alternative parity conserving theory.",

Such concern is, however, premature. The only way in which a set of co-planar momenta can have a notion of handedness akin to parity is if the plane in which they live is orientable. 7 It is for the same reason that the (planar) letter R can be distinguished from its mirror image R only if one side of the paper on which both are printed is deemed 'special'.

It is differences between the forward and backward boosts from parton distribution functions which would drive such an asymmetry, exploiting the dependence of \u03b1 on longitudinal boosts.

Nonetheless, we have: (i) demonstrated that parity violating models to which our variable is sensitive do not need to abandon the equivalence principle, Lorentz invariance or isotropy, and (ii) noted that since \u03b1 is defined in terms of only three objects the parity violating processes which \u03b1 is sensitive to would probably include only those which couple to asymmetric initial states, such as quark-gluon.",

Therefore, if the equivalence principle holds and the laws of physics are isotropic, then events of type \u03b1+ should occur as frequently as events of type \u03b1\u2212 in gluon-gluon interactions, and so the answer to the posed question is 'No!'. If instead the laws of physics are not Lorentz invariant, or not isotropic, then the answer could instead be 'Possibly!'.

A jet area method is used to correct for the remaining pile-up contributions [15]. Since the four-momenta of particle-flow objects is summed, the jets can be massive, In this analyses, we only study jets with a minimal transverse momentum of p T > 30 GeV and a jet rapidity of |y| < 2.4, since this region allows for the best jet resolution and pile-up rejection. In addition, certain quality criteria on the reconstructed jet properties, such as energy fraction in the ECAL and HCAL or the number of particle-flow objects is applied, following the standard CMS recommendations. Moreover, jets are required to have a minimal distance of \u2206R > 0.5 to all reconstructed electrons, muons and photons candidates. The reconstructed transverse momenta of jets is used to order them as the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd jet according to their p T and denoted as j 1 , j 2 and j 3 , respectively. This analysis is built around the CMS Open Data Software Framework available at [16]. Version CMSSW 5 3 32 [17] was used. A dedicated open-source framework, Bacon [18], which was used for several published studies of the CMS Collaboration, e.g. [9], is used to read the Analysis Object Data (AOD), extracting information on reconstructed objects as well as generator level data, if available. The Bacon software framework is also used to apply a GoodRun-List selection provided by the CMS Open Data project [19], as well as calibration constants for particle jets as well as E T observables, leading to a separate outputformat based on Root-tree objects. The typical event size of one simulated top-quark pair event in the Bacon-output format amounts to 5 kB. For this work, we used an additional software package, which reduces the output files of Bacon further and transforms them into a plain Root-NTuple, denoted as ODNTuple in the following with an average event size of 0.8 kB. Our analysis is based on these ODNTuple data. The full software, which has been used for this work, was previously used and validated for [20].",

As an additional cross-check, events with two jets with p j 1 T > 350 GeV and p j 2 T > 100 GeV and one additional reconstructed isolated muon with a transverse momentum of at least 50 GeV have been selected. Those events are expected to come from W/Z+jets, tt or W W decays, with at least one vector boson decaying leptonically. In total, 31 events pass this selection, of which no events with two muons were found. Assuming that these muons all stem from leptonic W -boson decays, we expect \u2248 310 electroweak background events, i.e. a background contribution of 1%, which we take as an estimate in the following.",

The difference to the nominal results is calculated for each scenario and taken as systematic. The systematic uncertainties due to the angular resolutions are estimated by adding an additional smearing on the reconstructed \u03b7 and \u03c6 values, following section 5, and then repeating the unfolding procedure. The modeling bias of the unfolding procedure has been tested in two different ways. First, the MC truth level distribution of \u03b1 was reweighted to the data distributions and then the unfolding procedure repeated. Second, the 4-jet QCD sample was used as a MC prior. The differences between the nominal and the alternative result was taken as systematic uncertainty and added in quadrature. The normalized unfolded distributions of \u03b1 are shown in figure 8 together their overall uncertainties. The numerical values, including a detailed split-up of the associated uncertainties is given in table 4. The total uncertainty ranges between 3% for the central bins to 13% for the bins corresponding to large absolute values of \u03b1. While the central bins are dominated by uncertainties of the jet energy scale systematics, the bins for |\u03b1| > 1 are dominated by the limited statistics of data and MC as well as modeling uncertainties. It is interesting to note, that these modeling uncertainties are not due from migration effects of \u03b1, rather than from efficiency corrections that have to be applied between the reconstruction and truth fiducial volumes.",

            "text": "Standard Model could lead to an asymmetry in the \u03b1 distribution, which can be quantified by an asymmetry parameter, A \u03b1 , which is expected to the zero in the SM. A \u03b1 was measured on data in three different kinematic regions, yielding to values which are consistent with zero. No obvious experimental challenges or limitations have been encountered, hence the sensitivity of this measurement could be dramatically improved with higher statistics on data and a better estimate of the corresponding experimental uncertainties. The models to which it is sensitive to could be changed by moving to other variables which probe the final state only, such as the variables \u03b4 and S 1 to S 4 defined in equations (2.3) to (2.7). The limitations of the unfolded distribution can be overcome by larger MC samples as well as a more careful evaluation of the associated model uncertainties. We therefore encourage LHC collaborations to perform similar studies in upcoming full Run-2 analysis a center of mass energy of 13 TeV.",
