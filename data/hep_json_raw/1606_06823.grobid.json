This analysis uses the full data set collected with the CDF II detector during Run II of the Tevatron collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb \u22121 . An analysis of the dijet mass spectrum provides 3.7\u03c3 evidence of the summed production processes of either WW or WZ bosons with a measured total cross section of \u03c3W W +W Z = 13.7 \u00b1 3.9 pb. Independent measurements of the WW and WZ production cross sections are allowed by the different heavy-flavor decay-patterns of the W and Z bosons and by the analysis of secondary-decay vertices reconstructed within heavy-flavor jets. The productions of WW and of WZ dibosons are independently seen with significances of 2.9\u03c3 and 2.1\u03c3, respectively, with total cross sections of \u03c3W W = 9.4 \u00b1 4.2 pb and \u03c3W Z = 3.7 +2.5 \u22122.2 pb. The measurements are consistent with standard-model predictions.",

Events are selected by requiring only one fullyreconstructed electron or muon candidate and an imbalance in the total energy measured with respect to the plane transverse to the colliding beams ( E T ), indicative of the presence of a neutrino. Both requirements strongly suppress the background of ZZ production where one of the two bosons decays hadronically and the other leptonically. A support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithm [22] is used to select events consistent with W \u2192 \u03bd+jets production. Finally, the hadronic decay of the W or Z boson is identified by requiring events with two jets with a large component of the momentum transverse to the beam (transverse momentum) and where, in at least one of them, a secondary-decay vertex is identified in at least one jet, indicating the presence of a b or c hadron (HF tag). The resonant W or Z boson signal is separated from the large nonresonant background by studying the dijet mass spectrum. In combination with this, a flavor-separator neural network [23] (flavor-separator NN) is used to separate jets originating from a charm or bottom quark, enhancing the sensitivity to WW or WZ production. The method with which the WW and WZ contributions are disentangled is novel. A Bayesian statistical analysis is then used to extract the signal cross sections by comparing the data to the background predictions. Further details on the analysis are in Ref. [24].",

Muon and electron candidates are required to originate from a primary vertex [42] within \u00b1 60 cm of the center of the CDF II detector, as measured along the beam line. A total of ten lepton-reconstruction algorithms, encompassing four \"tight\", five \"loose\", and one \"track-only\" classes are used. Two classes of tightelectron candidates are identified, associated with the central (|\u03b7| < 1.0) and forward (1.2 < |\u03b7| < 2.0) regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter, using selection requirements based on five electromagnetic-shower-shape profiles and calorimeter variables [24]. Two classes of tight-muon candidates are selected in the central muon subdetectors, for |\u03b7| < 0.6 and 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 1.0. A set of five loose-muon-class identification criteria is defined to recover signal acceptance up to |\u03b7| < 1.4 and in the gaps of the muon subdetectors. Each lepton-candidate class requires the presence of a reconstructed track in the drift chamber, except for the forward-electron class where only partial track-reconstruction in the silicon detectors is required [43]. The track-only class consists of good-quality tracks reconstructed in the drift chamber with \u2206R > 0.4 from any reconstructed hadronic jet, as defined in the following, with E T > 20 GeV. About 15% of the trackonly lepton candidates are expected to originate from electrons or \u03c4 lepton hadronic decays. To increase the purity of prompt leptons from W -boson decays, lepton candidates are required to be well isolated. Calorimeter isolation is used for tight and loose lepton classes: The energy reconstructed in a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.1 around the lepton must be less than 10% of the equivalent p T (E T ) of the muon (electron) candidate. Isolation in the tracking volume is used for the track-only leptons. The transverse momentum associated with the sum of all the tracks inside a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.1 around the track-only lepton candidate must be less than 10% of the p T of the candidate.",

If the two sets of vectors are not linearly separable, as is often the case in real applications, an appropriate transformation function, the \"kernel\", is used to map the vectors into a higher-dimension space where linear separation becomes possible. The margin is completely defined by a relatively small subset of the input training points, called \"support vectors\". A new point is classified according to its SVM output value, which is the signed distance of the point with respect to the margin in the space where linear separation is obtained. A negative or positive SVM output value corresponds to background-like or signal-like classification, respectively.",

The possibility that the corrections K i are not appropriate for the two-tag selection region, dominated by events with two HF partons identified in well separated jets, is studied at generator level: an uncertainty of 40% is used when extrapolating the K bb,cc correction to the two-tag-selection region.",

To improve the poor invariant mass resolution of the hadronic final state, the jet energy is corrected with a neural-network-based calibration [60], which uses information from jet-related variables and from the secondary decay vertex, if reconstructed in a jet.

Jets originating from c quarks are likely to obtain negative scores, clustering around the NN output value of \u22120.5. The m jj distribution and the flavorseparator NN output (divided in six bins) are combined in a two-dimensional distribution. This improves the separation of the WW and the WZ signals in the single-tag signal regions. Figure 2 shows example distributions for signals and background processes. The discrimination power of the flavor-separator NN is not important in the two-tag signal region as approximately 90% of the events selected in this category are expected to originate from processes with b quarks in the final state.

To determine the significance of the signal, we perform a hypothesis test by comparing the data with expec-tations under the null hypothesis of contributions from backgrounds only. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the results obtained in simplified simulated experiments that include contributions from signal and background, and background only processes. The probability p 0 of a background fluctuation to produce a signal strength equal or greater than the observed signal strength is 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , corresponding to evidence for WW+WZ production in the \u03bd HF final-state with a significance of 3.7\u03c3. The result is compatible with the expected significance of 3.9\u03c3, obtained from pseudoexperiments generated under the SM hypothesis. The WW and WZ cross sections are also measured separately by exploiting the differing decay patterns of the W and Z bosons, which result in differing signal fractions in the one-and two-tag signal regions and in different distributions in the flavour separator NN. The Bayesian analysis is repeated leaving the \u03c3 WW and \u03c3 WZ parameters free to vary. Figure 8 shows the resulting Bayesian posterior distribution, with integration contours at 68.3% and 95.5% Bayesian credibility levels. The maximum value corresponds to measured signal strengths of \u00b5 obs W W = 0.83 and \u00b5 obs W Z = 1.07 . If the twodimensional-Bayesian posterior is integrated with respect to the \u03c3 W Z or to the \u03c3 W W variable, the results are \u03c3 obs W W = 9.4 +3.0 \u22123.0 (stat) +2.9 \u22122.9 (syst) = 9.4 \u00b1 4.2 pb, (7) \u03c3 obs W Z = 3. 11.3 \u00b1 0.7 pb and \u03c3 SM W W = 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 pb [55], and corresponding to the most precise measurement of the WZproduction cross section in a semileptonic final state to date. Although the expected value of \u03c3 SM W W is about three times larger than the \u03c3 SM W Z value, the relative uncertainties in the WW and WZ cross-section measurements are comparable because of the low c-jet identification efficiency and the larger systematic uncertainty associated with it.

An artificial neural network dedicated to distinguishing the various flavors is used in conjunction with the dijet mass spectrum to identify the different heavy-flavor-decay pattern of the W and Z bosons. This gives an observed (expected) signal significance of 2.9\u03c3 (3.3\u03c3) and 2.1\u03c3 (2.0\u03c3) for WW and WZ processes, respectively. The measured total cross sections, within the full solid-angle acceptance, of \u03c3 W W = 9.4 \u00b1 4.2 pb and \u03c3 W Z = 3.7 +2.5 \u22122.2 pb are consistent with the SM expectations. The WZ cross section measurement is the most precise obtained to date with a semileptonic final state and supports the CDF capability to identify rare processes in this topology. As described in Section V B, a normalization correction factor, K, is used to account for the W +HF yield difference in data with respect to the HF fractions predicted by the alpgen [49] simulation. Following Ref. [23], the factor K is extracted from the W + 1 jet sample; however, in this analysis the W + bb plus W + cc, and W + c corrections are extracted simultaneously.",

The onejet-pretag selection region is then defined by the presence of exactly one jet of E T >20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0 in each event, and multijet background contamination is reduced by means of a selection requirement on the centralregion SVM-output-value distribution, as described in Sec. III C. The sample is then enriched in HF jets by requiring the jet to be tagged by the tight secvtx algorithm. The background estimate proceeds as described in Sec.
