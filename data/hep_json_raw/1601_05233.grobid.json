The final measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters, m 2 32 and \u03b8 23 , came from a full three flavour oscillation analysis of the combined CC \u03bd \u03bc and CC \u03bd \u03bc beam and atmospheric samples and the CC \u03bd e and CC \u03bd e appearance samples. This analysis yielded the most precise measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting m 2 32 performed to date. The results are | m 2 32 | = [2.28-2.46] \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 (68%) and sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.35-0.65 (90%) in the normal hierarchy, and | m 2 32 | = [2.32-2.53] \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 (68%) and sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.34-0.67 (90%) in the inverted hierarchy. The successor to MINOS in the NO\u03bdA era at FNAL, MINOS+, is now collecting data mostly in the 3-10 GeV region, and an analysis of \u03bd \u03bc disappearance using the first 2.99 \u00d7 10 20 POT of data produced results very consistent with those from MINOS. Future data will further test the standard neutrino oscillation paradigm and allow for improved searches for exotic phenomena including sterile neutrinos, large extra dimensions and non-standard interactions.",

The oscillations arise from the quantum mechanical interference between the neutrino mass states and are driven by the mass-squared splittings between these mass states, m 2 ij \u2261 m 2 i \u2212 m 2 j . It is possible to write down three mass-squared splittings, but only two are actually independent. One of the mass splittings, m 2 21 , is considerably smaller than the others, meaning there are two scales at which oscillations can occur. The signs of the other mass-splittings, m 2 32 and m 2 31 , are currently unknown, meaning it is not known whether m 3 is the lightest or heaviest mass state. The case where it is the heaviest (lightest) is referred to as the normal (inverted) hierarchy. A final, important consequence of neutrino oscillations is the requirement that at least two of the neutrino mass states must be non-zero.",

These channels were first probed using a man-made neutrino beam by the K2K experiment [5,18]. The discovery of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations was performed by T2K [8] and \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 appearance was discovered by the OPERA experiment [19]. Oscillations in such experiments are driven by the two larger mass-splittings, m 2 32 and m 2 31 .

All three neutrino flavours can undergo neutral-current (NC) interactions with the matter via the exchange of a Z boson but since this affects all neutrinos equally, it does not cause a change in the oscillations. However, only electron neutrinos can have charged-current (CC) interactions with the electrons in the matter via the exchange of a W boson, giving rise to a change in the oscillations. This phenomenon is known as the MSW effect [21,22]. In this case, \u03b8 13 is replaced by a modified mixing angle \u03b8 M as defined by [23] ",

The beam flux simulation and the method used to tune it based on the ND data was described in Section 2.2. The transport of the simulated particles through the detector simulation is performed by the GCALOR [36] and GEANT3 [37] packages. The process to calculate the FD prediction, known as the extrapolation procedure, consists of the following steps. Firstly, the event selection is performed at the ND for both data and simulation. The simulation is used to produce a matrix that converts between the reconstructed and true neutrino energy. The selected ND data are then multiplied by this matrix to convert to a pseudo-true energy. At this stage a correction is also applied to account for the selection efficiency in the ND. The next step applies the beam matrix, a correction that accounts for the difference in acceptance of the neutrino beam between the two detectors (the beam appears as a point source for the FD, whereas the ND sees an extended source). With the energy spectrum now in pseudo-true energy, the neutrino oscillations are applied using the three flavour (or historically, two flavour) oscillation formalism. Finally, the FD selection efficiency is applied and the energy is converted back to reconstructed neutrino energy using the FD version of the reconstructed to true energy conversion matrix. The resultant energy spectrum from this process is the predicted spectrum for the FD for the given oscillation parameters used in the extrapolation procedure.",

Atmospheric neutrinos that interact inside the fiducial volume, the contained-vertex sample, are simulated using NEUGEN3 [43] in the same way as for the beam neutrinos. NUANCE [44] is used to simulate the interaction of the atmospheric neutrinos in the rock surrounding the cavern and to propagate the final state particles up to the edge of the detector. The simulation of the particles in the detector is then the same for both samples, using the GCALOR [36] and GEANT3 [37] packages, in exactly the same way as for the beam neutrino simulation. Efforts are made to account for the change in atmospheric neutrino fluxes as a function of time due to variations in the solar cycle, an important consideration since the period over which data were collected covers nearly an entire solar cycle. It is predicted that the atmospheric neutrino flux can vary by up to 7% over this period [45].",

Instead, a sample of CC \u03bd \u03bc interactions are selected from data. The energy deposits in these interactions arising from the muon are then removed from the event [56] and replaced with energy deposits from a simulated electron shower [57]. The simulated electron vertex, direction and energy are set to match those of the reconstructed muon in the original data event. This procedure makes an effective sample of CC \u03bd e and CC \u03bd e data events that can be used to study the efficiency of selecting and identifying the signal events. This method was validated using those events that are not sensitive to the appearance signal, defined by \u03b1 LEM < 0.5, to predict the number of events in the same region of the FD data and agreement was found within the 0.3(0.6)\u03c3 of the statistical uncertainty for the CC \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) sample [26].",

The POT of the final analysis does not agree exactly with those quoted for the muon neutrino disappearance analysis because the short high energy run is not included in the electron neutrino appearance analysis as it has no sensitivity to the appearance signal. The result of the combined \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance search is shown on the left of Fig. 6, excluding the null hypothesis of no appearance at approximately the 96% confidence level. The contours are shown for the normal (top) and inverted (bottom) hierarchy for the lower octant of \u03b8 23 . The best fit is also shown for the upper octant, showing little sensitivity to the octant of \u03b8 23 .

The appearance sample is sensitive to \u03b4 CP , and it also provides some information on the mass hierarchy via matter effects as well as a small sensitivity to the octant of \u03b8 23 . The atmospheric neutrino sample includes a resonance region in multi-GeV upward going events, again providing sensitivity to the mass-hierarchy. This resonance exists in the normal hierarchy for neutrinos and in the inverted hierarchy for antineutrinos. The oscillation parameters that are free within the fit are m 2 32 , sin 2 \u03b8 23 , sin 2 \u03b8 13 and \u03b4 CP . The value of sin 2 \u03b8 13 is constrained using a Gaussian penalty term in the fit, using the central value and 1\u03c3 uncertainty from the average of the results from the reactor neutrino experiments Daya Bay [61], RENO [13] and Double Chooz [14]: sin 2 \u03b8 13 = 0.0242 \u00b1 0.0025. The values of m 2 21 and sin 2 \u03b8 12 are kept fixed in the fit at the following values: m 2 21 = 7.54 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b8 12 = 0.307 [62]. The effect of varying m 2 21 and sin 2 \u03b8 12 was checked by shifting them by their quoted uncertainty and looking at the change in the fitted values of m 2 32 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 . The changes caused by varying these parameters were found to be negligible, hence no penalty terms are included for m 2 21 and sin 2 \u03b8 12 . The oscillation probabilities used to perform the fit are calculated directly from the PMNS matrix without assumptions. The method takes advantage of matrix manipulation algorithms specially designed for high computational speed [63]. Matter effects are included using a four layer approximation of the PREM model [64]. All of the systematic uncertainty parameters are included with the corresponding samples and treated as nuisance parameters with penalty terms in the fit. The systematic parameters are those that account for the main differences between the simulation and the data. The likelihood is calculated separately for the \u03bd \u03bc disappearance and \u03bd e appearance samples and the two contributing values are then summed together under the assumption that the systematic uncertainties in the two samples are uncorrelated.",

The 68% contour is shown in red and the 90% contour is shown in blue. The overall best fit point is found to be in the inverted hierarchy, lower octant region.  2 32 | are the most precise at the time of writing, but Super-K [3] and T2K [9] have higher accuracy measurements of \u03b8 23 . The case known as maximal mixing in two flavour oscillations, namely that \u03b8 23 = \u03c0/4, is disfavoured at 1.54 units of \u22122 log(L) [65]. Fig. 10 shows the 1D likelihood profile as a function of \u03b4 CP . This distribution shows an enhanced sensitivity compared to the \u03bd e +\u03bd e appearance only result shown in the right plot in Fig. 6, but less than that of T2K [8]. The best-fit oscillation parameters are shown in Table 1 for each combination of the mass hierarchy and octant of \u03b8 23 . The data slightly disfavour the normal hierarchy, upper octant case across the whole range of \u03b4 CP , and above 90% for approximately half of the range of \u03b4 CP , with the best fit point in that case being disfavoured by a \u22122 log(L) of 1.74. The other three choices of the mass hierarchy and octant have very similar values of \u22122 log(L) and remain degenerate.",
