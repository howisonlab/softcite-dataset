            "text": "We present the first measurement of the inclusive three-jet differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the three jets with the largest transverse momenta in an event in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The measurement is made in different rapidity regions and for different jet transverse momentum requirements and is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.7 fb \u22121 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The results are used to test the three-jet matrix elements in perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant. The data allow discrimination between parametrizations of the parton distribution functions of the proton. The production cross section for jets with large transverse momenta (p T ) with respect to the beam axis in hadron-hadron collisions is predicted by perturbative QCD (pQCD) and is sensitive to the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 s ) and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the hadrons. Deviations from the pQCD predictions may indicate the presence of physics processes not included in the standard model. Recent measurements of inclusive jet and dijet production in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [1][2][3][4][5][6] have been used to determine \u03b1 s [7] and the proton PDFs [8][9][10] and to set limits on a number of models of physics beyond the standard model [3,5]. This demonstrates the success of pQCD in describing observables which are directly sensitive to the matrix elements of O(\u03b1 2 s ). Testing pQCD at higher orders of \u03b1 s requires measuring cross sections for higher jet multiplicities.",

Since pQCD calculations are available to nextto-leading order (NLO) in \u03b1 s [11][12][13][14], the three-jet cross section can be used for precision phenomenology such as simultaneous determinations of \u03b1 s and PDFs from experimental data.

The inclusive three-jet event sample consists of all events with three or more jets which pass given p T and |y| requirements. The M 3jet dependence of the inclusive threejet cross section is measured for five scenarios with different jet p T requirements and in different regions of jet rapidity. Jets are ordered in descending p T and the p T requirements are p T 1 > 150 GeV and p T 3 > 40 GeV (with no further requirement for p T 2 ). The rapidities of the three leading p T jets are restricted to |y| < 0.8, |y| < 1.6, or |y| < 2.4, in three different measurements. Two additional measurements are made for p T 3 > 70 GeV and p T 3 > 100 GeV, both requiring |y| < 2.4. For jets defined by the cone radius R cone and for a given p T 3 requirement, the relative p T between two jets (k \u22a5 ) could be as low as k \u22a5 \u2248 R cone \u2022 p T 3 , which introduces an additional, softer scale in the process (since k \u22a5 < p T 3 for R cone = 0.7). The phase space with k \u22a5 below the p T 3 requirement can be avoided by an additional requirement on the angular separation of the three leading p T jets. In all scenarios, all pairs of the three leading p T jets are required to be separated by \u2206R = (\u2206y) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 > 1.4 (= 2 \u2022R cone ). With this separation requirement, the smallest accessible k \u22a5 of the jets is always above p T 3 . Furthermore, this separation requirement also reduces the phase space in which pairs of the three leading p T jets are subject to the overlap treatment in the cone jet algorithm [17]. Since the overlap treatment can strongly depend on details of the energy distributions in the overlap area, this region of phase space may not be well modeled by pQCD calculations at lower orders. In the remaining analysis phase space, NLO pQCD calculations are not affected by the Run II cone algorithm's infrared sensitivity [18]. The data are corrected for instrumental effects and are presented at the \"particle level,\" which includes all stable particles as defined in Ref. [19].",

The absolute energy calibration is determined from Z \u2192 ee events and the p T imbalance in \u03b3 + jet events in the region |y| < 0.4. The extension to larger rapidities is derived from dijet events using a similar data-driven method. In addition, corrections are applied which take into account the difference in calorimeter response due to the difference in the fractional contributions of quark-and gluoninitiated jets in the dijet and the \u03b3 + jet event samples. These corrections of the order (2-4)% are determined using simulated jets produced with the pythia event generator [20] that have been passed through a geant-based detector simulation [21]. The total corrections for the jet four-momenta vary between 50% and 20% for jet p T between 50 and 400 GeV. These corrections adjust the reconstructed jet energy to the energy corresponding to the stable particles that entered the calorimeter except for muons and neutrinos, which are accounted for later by a separate correction. An additional correction is applied for systematic shifts in |y| due to detector effects [4]. The three-jet invariant mass is then computed from the corrected jet four-momenta of the three highest-p T jets in the event. The differential cross sections d\u03c3 3jet /dM 3jet are corrected for experimental effects [22].",

The simulation is based on parametrizations of resolution effects in p T , the polar and azimuthal angles of jets, jet reconstruction efficiencies, and misidentification of the event vertex, which are determined either from data or from a detailed simulation of the D0 detector using geant. The p T resolution for jets is about 15% at 40 GeV, decreasing to less than 10% at 400 GeV. The generated events are reweighted to match the M 3jet , p T , and |y| distributions in data. To minimize migrations between M 3jet bins due to resolution effects, we use the simulation to obtain a rescaling function in reconstructed M 3jet that optimizes the correlation between the reconstructed and true values. The bin sizes in the M 3jet distributions are chosen to be approximately twice the M 3jet resolution. The bin purity after M 3jet rescaling, defined as the fraction of all reconstructed events that were generated in the same bin, is above 40% for all bins. We then use the simulation to determine M 3jet bin correction factors for instrumental effects for the differential cross sections in the five different scenarios. These also include corrections for the energies of unreconstructed muons and neutrinos inside the jets. The total correction factors for the differential cross sections vary from about 1.0 at M 3jet = 0.4 TeV to 1.1 at 1.1 TeV for |y| < 0.8 and between 0.89 at M 3jet = 0.4 TeV to 0.96 at 1.1 TeV for |y| < 2.4. The dependence of the correction factors on the reweighting function is taken into account as an uncertainty. The corrected differential cross section in each scenario is presented at the \"particle level\" as defined in Ref. [19].",

The quoted central values of M 3jet at which the data points are presented are the locations where the bin averages have the same value as the differential cross section [25], as determined using smooth parametrizations of the data. The data are compared to theory predictions which have been obtained from NLO pQCD calculations with non-perturbative corrections applied. The non-perturbative corrections are determined using pythia with \"tune DW\" [26]. They are defined as the combination of the corrections due to hadronization and underlying event and vary between \u221210% and +2% (given in Table I). Using different pythia settings (A, BW, Z1, Perugia soft, Perugia hard tunes) affects the individual corrections by less than half of their sizes and the total corrections by less than 5%. The NLO results are computed using fastnlo [27] based on nlojet++ [13,14] with MSTW2008NLO PDFs [8] and the corresponding value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.1202. The central choice \u00b5 0 for the renormalization and factorization scales is the average p T of the three leading p T jets \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 = (p T 1 + p T 2 + p T 3 )/3. For a direct comparison of the theoretical predictions with data, the ratio of data and theory is displayed by the markers in Fig. 2 for all five scenarios. The effects of independent variations of renormalization and factorization scales between \u00b5 0 /2 and 2\u00b5 0 are displayed by the dotted lines. These variations affect the predicted cross sections between +(5-10)% and \u2212(15-20)%. The MSTW2008NLO PDF uncertainties (corresponding to the 68% C.L.) are shown by the light band. The ratios of data and theory are almost constant, with only a small dependence on M 3jet and the |y| and p T 3 requirements. The central data values are below the central theory predictions, by approximately (4-15)% in the different scenarios, slightly increasing with |y| and with p T 3 .

While some experimental uncertainties (like the luminosity uncertainty) allow to shift the data points coherently up or down, other uncertainty sources (such as the jet energy calibration), have M 3jetdependent effects which also allow changes to shapes of the data distributions. To quantify the significance of the differences between theory and data in normalization and shape as observed in Figs. 2 and 3, a \u03c7 2 is computed. The \u03c7 2 definition takes into account all experimental uncertainties and their correlations, as well as uncertainties in the hadronization and underlying event corrections. The latter two uncertainties are assumed to be half the size of the individual corrections, to be independent of each other, and each to be fully correlated over M 3jet . Correlations between the statistical uncertainties are ignored, since the overlap of the data for the different scenarios is not large. PDF uncertainties are not taken into account in the \u03c7 2 calculations. Otherwise, a theoretical prediction affected by large PDF uncertainties and in poor agreement with data may get a smaller \u03c7 2 than a prediction with better agreement with data but small PDF uncertainties. Therefore, since the PDF uncertainties are defined differently for different PDF parametrizations [30], the \u03c7 2 values would no longer be suited to benchmark different PDF parametrizations. This means that the \u03c7 2 values presented here are only a measure of the agreement of the central PDF fit results with the measured three-jet cross sections.",

            "text": "The theory results, and therefore the \u03c7 2 values, depend on the choices of \u03b1 s (M Z ) and the scales \u00b5 r and \u00b5 f used in the computations of the NLO matrix elements and on the chosen PDF parametrization. The latter also depend implicitly on the value of \u03b1 s (M Z ). All these dependencies are shown in Fig. 4, where the \u03c7 2 results are displayed as a function of \u03b1 s (M Z ) used in the NLO matrix elements and PDFs, for three alternative scale choices \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 /2 (a), \u00b5 0 (b), and 2\u00b5 0 (c). The results for the central \u03b1 s (M Z ) choices for the different PDF sets are also indicated. For \u03b1 s (M Z ) values close to the world average of 0.1184 \u00b1 0.0007 [31], for all PDF sets, with the exception of HERAPDFv1.0, the lowest \u03c7 2 is obtained for the central scale choice \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 . Table II gives a summary of the \u03c7  These are always above \u03c7 2 \u2265 81.7 for all 49 data points. For ABKM09NLO PDFs, which are available only for a single value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.1179, the smallest \u03c7 2 is 76.5, obtained for \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 . The best overall agreement, corresponding to the lowest \u03c7 2 values, is obtained for MSTW2008NLO for the central scale choice \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 and \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.121 with \u03c7 2 = 59.5. Very close to these are the results for NNPDFv2.1 for which the lowest \u03c7 2 is 59.9 for \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 0 and \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.123. The large \u03c7 2 differences between the different PDF sets demonstrate the PDF sensitivity of the three-jet cross section data. In summary, we have presented the first measurement of the inclusive three-jet differential cross section as a function of M 3jet in pp collisions at a center of mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The three-jet cross section is measured in five scenarios, in different rapidity regions and for different requirements for the jet transverse momenta. The data are compared to pQCD calculations in next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant for different PDF parametrizations, by computing \u03c7 2 values for different scale choices and different \u03b1 s (M Z ) values. The best description of the data is obtained for the MSTW2008NLO and NNPDFv2.1 PDF parametrizations which describe both the normalization and the shape of the observed M 3jet spectra. The PDF parametrizations from ABKM09NLO give a reasonable description of the data, although with a slightly different shape of the M 3jet spectrum. The central results from the CT10 and HERAPDFv1.0 PDF sets predict a different M 3jet shape and are in poorer agreement with the data.",
