Using single-ring data from an exposure of 273.4 kton \u2022 years, a search for these decays yields a result consistent with no signal. Accordingly, lower limits on the partial lifetimes of \u03c4 p\u2192e + X > 7.9 \u00d7 10 32 years, \u03c4 p\u2192\u00b5 + X > 4.1 \u00d7 10 32 years, \u03c4n\u2192\u03bd\u03b3 > 5.5 \u00d7 10 32 years, \u03c4 np\u2192e + \u03bd > 2.6 \u00d7 10 32 years, \u03c4 np\u2192\u00b5 + \u03bd > 2.2 \u00d7 10 32 years and \u03c4 np\u2192\u03c4 + \u03bd > 2.9 \u00d7 10 31 years at a 90% confidence level are obtained.

Gauge coupling unification, charge quantization and other features suggest a more unified account, such as a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) [1][2][3][4], as an underlying fundamental theory. While the unification scale (\u223c 10 15 \u2212 16 GeV) is unreachable by accelerators, rare processes predicted by these theories, such as proton decay, can be probed by large underground detectors. Being a signature prediction of GUTs, observation of an unstable proton would constitute robust evidence for physics beyond the SM, while non-observation will stringently constrain theoretical models.",

First, we have considered two general two-body decays p \u2192 e + X and p \u2192 \u00b5 + X, where X is a single unknown invisible particle which is assumed to be massless. These searches are distinct from the modeldependent inclusive analyses of [12,13] listed in the PDG [14]. Similarly, we also consider n \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3. Though this radiative process is suppressed, it has a clean signature and has been considered in the context of SU(5) [15], with some models [9] predicting a lifetime of 10 38\u00b11 years.",

These higher-dimensional processes can become significant in models which suppress proton decay and could be connected to baryogenesis [16], accounting for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe [17]. Such a connection may already be hinted at from the requirement of baryon number violation as a necessary condition for explaining the asymmetry [18]. The disappearance \u2206B = 2 reactions, with invisible final state particles, have been studied and no signal excess was observed [19][20][21]. The channels np \u2192 e + \u03bd, np \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd and np \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd violate baryon number by two units and violate lepton number by either two or zero units. They can become significant in models with an extended Higgs sector [16,22], which could be considered in the context of GUTs [23]. While the \u03c4 cannot occur in single nucleon decay, in di-nucleon decay the \u03c4 channel is allowed [24]. The process np \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd has not been experimentally studied before and in addition to the electron and muon channel searches we present the first search in the \u03c4 channel.",

            "text": "Since final-state neutrinos or X (by definition) are not observed, the only signature of p \u2192 e + X, p \u2192 \u00b5 + X, n \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3, np \u2192 e + \u03bd and np \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd is a single charged e + or \u00b5 + lepton, or single \u03b3. Thus, the invariant mass of the initial state cannot be reconstructed and the signal will be superimposed on a substantial atmospheric neutrino background in the e-like and \u00b5-like momentum spectra. For the np \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd decay, only the \u03c4 \u2192 e + \u03bd\u03bd and \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u03bd channels are considered, with the respective branching ratios of 17.8% and 17.4%. This allows us to perform all the analyses within a unified framework. The previous searches for n \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3, np \u2192 e + \u03bd and np \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd, which were performed with a smaller detector using a counting method, resulted in the lifetime limits of 2.8 \u00d7 10 31 years [5], 2.8 \u00d7 10 30 years [19] and 1.6 \u00d7 10 30 years [19], respectively. In contrast, the spectral fit employed within this work, allows utilization of the extra information from the energy dependence of signal, background and the systematic errors. This methodology has been recently employed in the SK nucleon decay [11,27] and dark matter analyses [28].",

The final state particles are generated with energy and momentum uniformly distributed in phase space. The effects of Fermi motion, nuclear binding energy as well as nucleon -nucleon correlated decays [29] are taken into account for both nucleon [30][31][32] and di-nucleon searches [33]. The signal Fermi momentum distributions are simulated using a spectral function fit to electron-12 C scattering data [34]. The SK detector simulation [26] is based on the GEANT-3 [35] package, with the TAUOLA [36] package employed for decaying the \u03c4 leptons. For the np \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd mode we generated three MC samples, with the \u03c4 decaying to e + \u03bd\u03bd, \u00b5 + \u03bd\u03bd and all decay channels. The latter allows us to study sample contamination in the two selected leptonic \u03c4 channels from the hadronic \u03c4 channels and thus identify sample purity after the event selection. We have confirmed that the resulting MC charged lepton spectra from \u03c4 \u2192 e + \u03bd\u03bd and \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u03bd decays agree with the theoretical formula [37]. For p \u2192 e + X and p \u2192 \u00b5 + X modes, the invisible X particle cannot be a fermion by spin conservation, but in our spin-insensitive MC it was simulated as a neutrino. In total, around 4,200 signal events were generated within the fiducial volume (FV) for each SK period for single nucleon decays and around 8,400 for di-nucleon decays.",

The N 90CL as well as resulting sensitivities and calculated lifetime limits for the decays are shown in Table I. The sensitivities were obtained assuming that data are described by background.

We find no evidence for any contribution from the six different nucleon and di-nucleon decay modes that would produce a showering or non-showering Cherenkov ring. The results of this analysis provide a stringent test of new physics. The obtained limits represent more than an order of magnitude improvement over the previous analyses of n \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3 [5] and two orders of magnitude for np \u2192 e + \u03bd and np \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd [19]. The searches for p \u2192 e + X, p \u2192 \u00b5 + X (where X is an invisible, massless particle) and np \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd are novel.
