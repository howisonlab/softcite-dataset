The analysis exploits a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to 3.0 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb experiment. Measurements from CLEO-c of the variation of the strong-interaction phase of the D decay over the Dalitz plot are used as inputs. The values of the parameters are found to be x + = (\u22127.7 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , x \u2212 = (2.5 \u00b1 2.5 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , y + = (\u22122.2 \u00b1 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , and y \u2212 = (7.5 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 \u22122 . The first, second, and third uncertainties are the statistical, the experimental systematic, and that associated with the precision of the strong-phase parameters. These are the most precise measurements of these observables and correspond to \u03b3 = (62 +15 \u221214 )",

Measurements of this weak phase in tree-level processes involving the interference between b \u2192 c\u016bs and b \u2192 ucs transitions are expected to be insensitive to contributions from physics beyond the SM. Such measurements therefore provide a SM benchmark against which other observables, more likely to be affected by physics beyond the SM, can be compared. The effects of the interference can be probed by studying CP -violating observables in B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 decays, where D represents a neutral D meson reconstructed in a final state that is common to both D 0 and D 0 decays. Examples of such final states recently studied by LHCb are two-body decays [1], multibody decays that are not self-conjugate [2,3], and self-conjugate three-body decays, such as K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K 0 S K + K \u2212 , designated collectively as K 0 S h + h \u2212 [4]. Similar measurements have also been made using neutral B 0 [5] and B 0 s [6] mesons. Sensitivity to \u03b3 in B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 K 0",

One approach, adopted by the BaBar [9][10][11], Belle [12][13][14] and LHCb [15] collaborations, is to use an amplitude model determined from flavour-tagged D \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 decays to provide this input. An attractive alternative [7,16,17] is to use direct measurements of the strong-phase variation over bins of the Dalitz plot, thereby avoiding model-related systematic uncertainties. Such measurements can be obtained using quantum-correlated D 0 D 0 pairs from \u03c8(3770) decays and have been made at CLEO-c [18]. This model-independent method has been applied to measurements at Belle [19] using B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, and at LHCb [4] using a subset of data used in the current analysis.",

The optimisation was performed assuming a strong-phase difference distribution as given by the BaBar model presented in ref. [10]. For the K 0 S K + K \u2212 final state, c i and s i measurements are available for the Dalitz plot partitioned into different numbers of bins with the guiding model being that from the BaBar study described in ref.

The use of a specific model in defining the bin boundaries does not bias the c i and s i measurements.

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 2 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with large transverse momentum. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [26]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [27]. The trigger [28] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The trigger algorithms used to select candidate fully hadronic and semileptonic B decays are slightly different due to the presence of the muon in the latter.",

A boosted decision tree [38,39] (BDT) is trained on simulated signal events and background taken from the high B \u00b1 mass sideband (5800-7000 MeV/c 2 ). Both signal and background samples contain candidates from the D and K 0 S signal regions only. Different BDTs are trained for long and downstream candidates. Each BDT uses the following variables: the logarithm of the \u03c7 2 IP of the pions from the D decay and also of the bachelor particle; the logarithm of the \u03c7 2 IP of the K 0 S decay products (long candidates only); the logarithm of the D \u03c7 2 IP ; the B \u00b1 \u03c7 2 IP ; a variable characterising the B \u00b1 flight distance; the B \u00b1 and D momenta; the \u03c7 2 of the kinematic fit of the whole decay chain, (described in detail below); and the 'B \u00b1 isolation variable', a quantity designed to ensure the B \u00b1 candidate is well isolated from other tracks in the event. The B \u00b1 isolation variable is the asymmetry between the p T of the signal candidate and the vector sum of the p T of the other tracks in the event that lie within a distance of 1.5 rad in \u03b7-\u03c6 space, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. The discriminating power of the variables differs slightly for long and downstream candidates. Two variables that are highly discriminating for both samples are the B \u00b1 \u03c7 2 IP and B \u00b1 isolation variable. An optimal value of the BDT discriminator is determined with a series of pseudo-experiments to obtain the value that provides the best sensitivity to x \u00b1 , y \u00b1 . Events in the data sample that have a value below the optimum are rejected. The optimal BDT value is different for long and downstream candidates primarily because the level of combinatorial background is larger for the latter.",

Reco. in figure 2 and figure 3) contaminate the sample predominantly at invariant masses smaller than that of the signal peak. These decays contain an unreconstructed pion or a photon, which comes from a vector-meson decay. The dominant decays in the signal region are B \u00b1 \u2192 D\u03c1 \u00b1 , B \u00b1 \u2192 D * 0 \u03c0 \u00b1 and B 0 \u2192 D * \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays in which one particle is missed. The distribution in the invariant mass spectrum depends on the spin and mass of the missing particle. If the missing particle has spin-parity J P = 0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 ), the distribution is parameterised with a parabola with positive (negative) curvature convolved with a resolution function. The mass of the missing particle defines the kinematic endpoints of the distribution prior to reconstruction. The shapes for decays in which a particle is missed and a pion is misidentified as a kaon are parameterised with semi-empirical PDFs formed from sums of Gaussian and error functions. The parameters of these distributions are fixed to the results of fits to data from two-body D decays, with the exception of the resolution function width, the ratio of widths in the B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 and B \u00b1 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u00b1 channels and a shift along the B \u00b1 mass.

The first, second, and third uncertainties are the statistical, the experimental systematic, and the error associated with the precision of the strong-phase parameters, respectively. B mass range is reduced to 5150-5800 GeV/c 2 to reduce systematic uncertainties from the partially reconstructed background. The yields of all background contributions in each bin are free parameters, apart from the yields in bins in which an auxiliary fit determines the yield to be negligible. These are set to zero to facilitate the calculation of the uncertainty matrix. The yields of signal candidates for each bin in the B \u00b1 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u00b1 sample are also free parameters. The amount of signal in each bin for the B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 sample is determined by varying the integrated yield over all Dalitz plot bins and the x \u00b1 and y \u00b1 parameters. In the fit the values of F i are Gaussian-constrained within their uncertainties. The values of c i and s i are fixed to their central values.

In each pseudo-experiment the numbers and distribution of signal and background candidates are generated according to the expected distribution in data, and the full fit procedure is then executed. The input values for x \u00b1 and y \u00b1 are set close to those determined by previous measurements [42]. The uncertainties estimated by the fit are consistent with the size of the uncertainties estimated by the pseudo-experiments. However, small biases, with sizes around 10% of the statistical uncertainty, are observed in the central values. These biases are due to the low event yields in some of the bins and are observed to reduce in simulated experiments of larger size. The central values are corrected for the biases.",

This is small compared to the typical width of a bin but net migration away from the more densely populated bins is possible. To first order this effect is accounted for by use of the control channel, but residual effects enter due to the different distribution in the Dalitz plot of the signal events. The uncertainty due to these residual effects is determined via pseudo-experiments, in which different input F i values are used to reflect the residual migration. The size of any possible bias is found to vary between 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 0.2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 .",

These uncertainties are determined by performing sets of pseudo-experiments, each generated with different values of x \u00b1 and y \u00b1 according to the range allowed by current experimental knowledge. The spread in observed bias is combined in quadrature with half the correction and the uncertainty in the precision of the pseudo-experiments. This is taken as the systematic uncertainty, and is 0.2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for all CP parameters. The effect that a detection asymmetry between hadrons of opposite charge can have on the symmetry of the efficiency of the Dalitz plot is found to be negligible. Changes in the mass model used to describe the semileptonic control sample are found to have a negligible effect on the F i values.",
