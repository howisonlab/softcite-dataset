            "text": "Measurements of production cross sections of WZ and same-sign WW boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC are reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector during 2016-2018. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes W \u00b1 Z \u2192 \u00b1 \u03bd \u00b1 \u2213 and W \u00b1 W \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u03bd \u00b1 \u03bd, where , = e, \u03bc. Differential fiducial cross sections as functions of the invariant masses of the jet and charged lepton pairs, as well as of the leading-lepton transverse momentum, are measured for W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production and are consistent with the standard model predictions. The dependence of differential cross sections on the invariant mass of the jet pair is also measured for WZ production. An observation of electroweak production of WZ boson pairs is reported with an observed (expected) significance of 6.8 (5.3) standard deviations. Constraints are obtained on the structure of quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of effective field theory.",

Further insight into the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking mechanism can be achieved through measurements of vector boson scattering (VBS) processes [10,11]. At the CERN LHC interactions from VBS are characterized by the presence of two gauge bosons, in association with two forward jets with large dijet invariant mass and large rapidity separation, as shown in Fig. 1. They are part of a class of processes contributing to diboson plus two jets production that proceeds via the EW interaction, referred to as EW-induced diboson production, at tree level, O(\u03b1 4 ), where \u03b1 is the EW coupling.",

Representative Feynman diagrams of a VBS process contributing to the EW-induced production of events containing W \u00b1 W \u00b1 (left) and WZ (right) boson pairs decaying to leptons, and two forward jets. New physics (represented by a dashed circle) in the EW sector can modify the quartic gauge couplings. The requirements on the dijet mass and rapidity separation reduce the contribution from the QCD-induced production of boson pairs in association with two jets, making the experimental signature an ideal topology for VBS studies. Fig. 2 shows representative Feynman diagrams of the QCD-induced production. The EW W \u00b1 W \u00b1 and WZ production cross sections are simultaneously measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit of several distributions sensitive to these processes. The EW production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 at the LHC in the leptonic decay modes has been previously measured at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV [19][20][21][22]. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported observations of the EW W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production at 13 TeV with a significance greater than 5 standard deviations using the data collected in 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities of approximately 36 fb \u22121 . The EW WZ production in the fully leptonic decay modes has been studied at 8 and 13 TeV [23-25]; the ATLAS Collaboration reported an observation at 13 TeV with a significance greater than 5 standard deviations. The EW production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 and WZ boson pairs has also been studied in semileptonic final states [26]. Limits on aQGCs were also reported in Refs. [27,28].",

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| < 5. Muons are detected in gasionization chambers embedded in the steel magnetic flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables, is reported in Ref. [18]. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [29]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz with a latency of 4 \u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.4.2 is also used to simulate the QCD-induced W \u00b1 W \u00b1 process. Contributions with an initial-state b quark are excluded from the EW WZ simulation because they are considered part of the tZq background process. Triboson processes, where the WZ boson pair is accompanied by a third vector boson that decays into jets, are included in the simulation. The simulation of the aQGC processes uses the MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator and employs matrix element reweighting to obtain a finely spaced grid of parameters for each of the probed anomalous couplings [33]. The QCD-induced WZ process is simulated at LO with up to three additional partons in the matrix element calculations using the MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator with at least one QCD vertex at tree level. The different jet multiplicities are merged using the MLM scheme [34] to match matrix element and parton shower jets, and the inclusive contribution is normalized to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) predictions [35]. The interference between the EW and QCD diagrams is also produced with MadGraph5_amc@nlo. The contribution of the interference is considered to be part of the EW production, leading to an increase of about 4 and 1% of the expected yields of the EW W \u00b1 W \u00b1 and WZ processes in the fiducial region, respectively. A complete set of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and EW corrections for the leptonic W \u00b1 W \u00b1 scattering process have been computed [36,37] and they reduce the LO cross section of the EW W \u00b1 W \u00b1 process at the level of 10-15%, with the correction increasing in magnitude with increasing dilepton and dijet invariant masses. Similarly, the NLO QCD and EW corrections for the leptonic WZ scattering process have been computed at the orders of O(\u03b1 S \u03b1 6 ) and O(\u03b1 7 ) [38], reducing the cross sections for the EW WZ process at the level of 10%. The predictions for the cross sections of the EW W \u00b1 W \u00b1 and WZ processes are also made after applying these O(\u03b1 S \u03b1 6 ) and O(\u03b1 7 ) corrections to Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo LO cross sections. These corrections have approximately 1% effect on the measurements and are not included at the data analysis level. Satisfactory agreement between predictions from MadGraph5_amc@nlo and various event generators and fixed-order calculations in the fiducial region is reported in Ref. [39].",

The normalization of the WZ contribution in the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 SR is constrained by the data in the WZ SR, which is evaluated simultaneously for the extraction of results. The background contribution from charge misidentification (wrong-sign) is estimated by applying a data-to-simulation efficiency correction due to charge-misidentified electrons. The electron charge misidentification rate, estimated using Drell-Yan events, is about 0.01 (0.3)% in the barrel (endcap) region [61,68]. The nonprompt lepton backgrounds originating from leptonic decays of heavy quarks, hadrons misidentified as leptons, and electrons from photon conversions are suppressed by the identification and isolation requirements imposed on electrons and muons. The remaining contribution from the nonprompt lepton background is estimated directly from a data sample following the technique described in Ref. [19]. This sample is selected by choosing events using the final selection criteria, except for one of the leptons for which the selection is relaxed to a looser criteria and that has failed the nominal selection. The yield in this sample is extrapolated to the signal region using the efficiencies for such loosely identified leptons to pass the standard lepton selection criteria. This efficiency is calculated in a sample of events dominated by dijet production. A normalization uncertainty of 20% is assigned for the nonprompt lepton background to include possible differences in the composition of jets between the data sample used to derive these efficiencies and the data samples in the W The second CR is defined by selecting events satisfying the requirements on the leptons, p j T , and m jj , but with at least one of the other requirements in Table 1 not satisfied. Good agreement between the data and predicted yields is observed in all these regions.",
