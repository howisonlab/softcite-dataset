At sufficiently high energies, the power-like behavior of the energy dependence is expected to be modified by the Froissart bound [6] and the total cross section is expected to behave as ln 2 (W 2 ). Recent analyses of hadron-proton and photon-proton cross sections indicate that already at present energies a ln 2 (W 2 ) dependence is observed [7][8][9]. The data from many experiments must be combined in such fits and the evaluation of the influence of systematic uncertainties is complex.",

The measurements of the total \u03b3p cross section at HERA for W \u2243 200 GeV [10][11][12][13][14] combined with measurements at low W confirmed that the total photoproduction cross section has a W dependence similar to that of hadron-hadron reactions. This similarity extends to virtualities Q 2 of the photon up to \u2248 1 GeV 2 [15]. This paper presents a determination of the W dependence of \u03c3 \u03b3p tot from ZEUS data alone, in the range 194-296 GeV. This was made possible because in the final months of operation, the HERA collider was run with constant nominal positron energy, and switched to two additional proton energies, lower than the nominal value of 920 GeV. Many of the systematic uncertainties arising in the extraction of \u03c3 \u03b3p tot are now common and do not affect the relative values of \u03c3 \u03b3p tot at different W . As the Reggeon term is expected to be small, the function in Eq. (1) can be simplified to the form",

One sample required also the TAG6 trigger with all TAG6 cuts applied and provides a sample of TAG6 bremsstrahlung overlaps. The other sample was selected with a trigger requiring E PCAL 4 GeV and provides a sample of the bremsstrahlung overlaps independent of a TAG6 hit. Only signals from the PCAL were available at the trigger level. This results in the smeared thresholds in the E PCKV distributions of Fig. 2b. Note that the quoted thresholds in E PCAL are only approximate, since the trigger conditions were based on uncorrected E PCAL values. All distributions are restricted to 4 E PCAL 14 GeV to account for the threshold of the various data samples. The two distributions of bremsstrahlung events were used to fit the distribution from the photoproduction events; the component from the tagged bremsstrahlung events is the number of tagged bremsstrahlung overlaps in the sample where the photon reached the PCAL. The acceptance of photons in the PCAL was \u2248 85%, with losses due to conversions in the exit window and the limited geometric acceptance from the aperture defined by the HERA beamline elements. The number of overlaps seen in the PCAL, corrected for the PCAL acceptance, is the number of bremsstrahlung overlaps to subtract from the selected photoproduction sample.

Figure 3b shows the measured E RCAL distributions, after all selections and corrections, for all three proton energies. The HER and LER distributions were normalized to the MER distribution for E RCAL > 5 GeV. The three distributions are very similar in shape. The acceptance of the hadronic final state was further investigated using the Pythia MC described in Section 4. Figure 3b shows the E RCAL distribution from the simulation for all three proton energies, normalized to the MER data for E RCAL > 5 GeV. The differences between Pythia and the data are similar for all proton energies.
