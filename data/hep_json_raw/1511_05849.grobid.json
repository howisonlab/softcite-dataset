            "text": "The RENO experiment has analyzed about 500 live days of data to observe an energy dependent disappearance of reactor \u03bde by comparison of their prompt signal spectra measured in two identical near and far detectors. In the period between August 2011 and January 2013, the far (near) detector observed 31541 (290775) electron antineutrino candidate events with a background fraction of 4.9% (2.8%). The measured prompt spectra show an excess of reactor \u03bde around 5 MeV relative to the prediction from a most commonly used model. A clear energy and baseline dependent disappearance of reactor \u03bde is observed in the deficit of the observed number of \u03bde. Based on the measured far-to-near ratio of prompt spectra, we obtain sin 2 2\u03b813 = 0.082 \u00b1 0.009(stat.) \u00b1 0.006(syst.) and |\u2206m 2 ee | = [2.62 +0.21 \u22120.23 (stat.) +0.12 \u22120.13 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 .",

All of the three mixing angles in the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix [4,5] have been measured to provide a comprehensive picture of neutrino transformation. The successful measurement of a rather large \u03b8 13 value opens the possibility of searching for CP violation in the leptonic sector and determining the neutrino mass ordering.

IBD events with E p < 1.2 MeV include prompt signals of positrons occurring in or near the target acrylic vessel that deposit kinetic energy in the acrylic without producing scintillation lights. These events are reconstructed to have visible energy near the positron annihilation energy of 1.02 MeV and are not well reproduced by the MC prediction. The IBD signal loss by E p < 1.2 MeV requirement is roughly 2% in both detectors. In the final data samples, the remaining backgrounds are either uncorrelated or correlated IBD candidates. An accidental background comes from an uncorrelated pair of prompt-and delayed-like events. Correlated backgrounds are fast neutrons from outside of ID, stopping muon followers, \u03b2-n emitters from cosmic muon induced 9 Li/ 8 He isotopes, and 252 Cf contamination. The total background fraction is 4.9\u00b10.4% in the far detector, and 2.8 \u00b1 0.1% in the near detector. The remaining accidental background in the final sample is estimated by measuring random spatial associations of prompt-and delayed-like events. The prompt energy spectrum of accidental background is obtained from a control sample that is selected by a requirement of temporal association larger than 1 ms. Even though the accidental background is increased by 42.6% (60.2%) in the far (near) detector, the background uncertainty remains almost the same due to high statistics of the background control sample. The energy spectrum of 9 Li/ 8 He background is measured using a sample of IBD-like pairs that are preceded within 500 ms (400 ms) by energetic muons of E \u00b5 > 1.5 GeV (>1.6 GeV) for the far (near) detector. The 9 Li/ 8 He background rate in the final sample is obtained from the measured rate in the background dominant region of E p > 8 MeV using the measured background spectrum. The new method of 9 Li/ 8 He background estimation contributes to reduction of the largest background uncertainty. The fast neutron background rate in the IBD candidates is estimated by extrapolating from the background dominant energy region, assuming a flat spectrum of the background. A fast neutron enriched sample is obtained by selecting IBD candidates if they are accompanied by any prompt candidates of E p >0.7 MeV within a 1 ms subsequent window. The prompt events of this sample show a reasonably flat spectrum in the IBD signal region. The background uncertainty includes a possible deviation from the flat spectrum, 1.3% (1.2%) of the fast neutron background rate for the far (near) detector. The background rate is reduced by 50.5% (54.4%) due to the additional multiplicity requirements for the far (near) detector.",

Figure 2 shows a spectral comparison of the observed IBD prompt spectrum after background subtraction to the prediction that is expected from a reactor neutrino model [20,21] and the best fit oscillation results. The subtracted background spectra are shown in the insets. A clear spectral difference is observed in the region centered at 5 MeV. The MC predicted distributions are normalized to the observed events out of the excess range 3.6 < E p < 6.6 MeV. The excess of events constitutes about 3% of the total observed reactor \u03bd e rate in both detectors. Furthermore, the excess is observed to be proportional to the reactor power. This observation suggests needs for reevaluation and modification of the current reactor \u03bd e model [20,21]. The expected distributions are obtained using rate and spectral analysis results discussed later. The observed spectra are obtained from subtracting the background spectra as shown in the insets.

The relative measurement using identical near and far detectors makes the method insensitive to the correlated uncertainties of expected reactor \u03bd e flux and spectrum as well as detection efficiency. To determine |\u2206m 2 ee | and \u03b8 13 simultaneously, a \u03c7 2 is constructed using the spectral ratio measurement and is minimized [23]: is calculated using the reactor \u03bd e spectrum model and the IBD cross section and folding the \u03bd e survival probability and the detector effects. The systematic uncertainty sources are embedded by pull parameters (b d , f r , , and e) with associated systematic uncertainties (\u03c3 d bkg , \u03c3 r f lux , \u03c3 ef f , and \u03c3 scale ). The pull parameters b d and e introduce deviations from the expected IBD spectra accounting for the effects of the associated energy-dependent systematic uncertainties. The uncorrelated reactor-flux uncertainty \u03c3 r f lux is 0.9%, the uncorrelated detection uncertainty \u03c3 ef f is 0.2%, the uncorrelated energy scale uncertainty \u03c3 scale is 0.15%, and the background uncertainty \u03c3 d bkg is 4.7% and 7.3% for near and far detectors, respectively. The \u03c7 2 is minimized with respect to the pull parameters and the oscillation parameters. The best-fit values obtained from the rate and spectral analysis are sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.082 \u00b1 0.009(stat.) \u00b1 0.006(syst.) and |\u2206m 2 ee | = [2.62 +0.21 \u22120.23 (stat.) +0.12 \u22120.13 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 with \u03c7 2 /N DF = 58.9/66. A fit result is also obtained using an independent pull parameter for each energy bin to allow maximum variation of the background shapes within their uncertainties. The total systematic errors for both sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and |\u2206m 2 ee | remain almost unchanged. The dominant systematic uncertainties are those of the energy scale difference and the backgrounds as shown in Table II  Figure 3 shows the background-subtracted, observed spectrum at far detector compared to the one expected for no oscillation and the one expected for the best-fit oscillation at the far detector. The expected spectra are obtained by weighting the spectrum at near detector with the oscillation or no oscillation assumptions using the measured values of \u03b8 13 and |\u2206m 2 ee |. The observed spectrum shows a clear energy-dependent disappearance of reactor \u03bd e consistent with neutrino oscillations.  The results from other reactor experiments [11,24] are compared in the figure. Figure 5 shows the measured survival probability of reactor \u03bd e as a function of an effective baseline L eff over \u03bd e energy E \u03bd in the far detector, in a good agreement with the prediction that is obtained from the observed distribution in the near detector, for the best-fit oscillation values. This result demonstrates clear L eff /E \u03bddependent disappearance of reactor \u03bd e , consistent with the periodic feature of neutrino oscillation. Note that L eff is the reactor-detector distance weighted by the multiple reactor fluxes, and E \u03bd is converted from the IBD prompt energy. The measured survival probability is obtained by the ratio of the observed IBD counts to the expected counts assuming no oscillation in each bin of L eff /E \u03bd . In summary, RENO has observed clear energydependent disappearance of reactor \u03bd e using two identical detectors, and obtains sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.082 \u00b1 0.010 and |\u2206m 2 ee | = (2.62 +0.24 \u22120.26 ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 based on the measured periodic disappearance expected from neutrino oscillations. Several improvements in energy calibration and background estimation have been made to reduce the systematic error of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 from 0.019 [1] to 0.006. With the 500 day data sample together, RENO has produced a precise measurement of the mixing angle \u03b8 13 . It would provide an important information on determination of the leptonic CP phase if combined with a result of an accelerator neutrino beam experiment [6]. Measured reactor \u03bde survival probability in the far detector as a function of L eff /E\u03bd . The curve is a predicted survival probability, obtained from the observed probability in the near detector, for the best-fit values of |\u2206m 2 ee | and sin 2 2\u03b813. The L eff /E\u03bd value of each data point is given by the average of the counts in each bin.",
