Since the discovery of Bjorken scaling [1] and its violation [2] at fixed target experiments, DIS measurements have made essential contributions to the development of the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Major progress in the exploration of strong interactions has been achieved at the electron 1 -proton collider HERA, operating at the energy frontier. Measurements performed at HERA are essential for predictions of the physics at the forthcoming proton-proton collider, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",

Similarly the increase of F 2 (x, Q 2 ) with Q 2 at fixed small x reveals a strongly rising behaviour of the gluon density towards low x. This is obtained in perturbative QCD (pQCD) analyses of DIS data [5][6][7][8] using the derivative \u2202F 2 /\u2202 ln Q 2 , which is related to the gluon and quark densities as prescribed by the DGLAP evolution equations [9][10][11][12][13].",

Therefore the cross sections can be expressed as a product of the square of the wavefunction of the qq pair with a universal dipol-proton cross section. Another phenomenological model, used here, describes F 2 (x, Q 2 ) based on the idea of self-similarity of the proton substructure at small x [33].",

Section 6 presents the event selection and reconstruction, followed by Sect. 7 on the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of events. In Sect. 8 a detailed account of the analysis techniques and uncertainties of the measurement is given, and the cross sections obtained from the 1999 and 2000 data are presented. In Sect. 9 the data averaging method and the combination of the new data with the previous H1 data taken at E p = 820 GeV are presented.

First, the double differential cross section is measured following (19) using an initial approximation for the MC input cross section. Next, the measured double differential cross section is fitted with a new parameterisation using the fractal model and the analysis of the Monte Carlo events is repeated with an additional weight factor, equal to the ratio of the new to the initial double differential cross sections in each simulated event. For the reweighting, the event kinematics are calculated using the generated x and Q 2 variables at the hadronic vertex, such that corrections due to radiation from the lepton line are properly accounted for. This reweighting procedure is used for the measurement region. For the high x > 0.02 domain, which lies outside the measurement region, the ALLM parameterisation [49] is used.",

The sense wires are strung perpendicularly to the beam axis and are fixed at the sector edges leading to an octagonal geometry with almost radial drift directions. The drift cells are 1 cm wide in the inner region and 3 cm wide in the outer. At the transition from the inner to the outer region a special cell is introduced with 0.5 cm drift distance at the inner side and 1.5 cm drift distance at the outer. The cells within one double layer are shifted by half a drift cell in the radial direction to solve the inner-outer hit assignment ambiguity. The double layers are rotated by \u2022 with respect to each other to allow for reconstruction of the azimuthal coordinate. In addition, this reduces the efficiency losses at the sector edges. The radial resolution for minimum ionising particles is 400 \u00b5m. The resolution in the azimuthal direction is about 2 mm.",

Initially, candidate trajectories are found in the xy plane using a fast circle fit algorithm [64]. The z coordinate is added to the tracks based on charge division information. A linear fit in S-z space is performed where the S coordinate measures an arc length of the track in the xy projection. Next, the tracks are fitted to a common vertex in the xy plane. At this stage detailed corrections are applied for multiple scattering in the detector material and for magnetic field non-uniformity. For the tracks which are determined by the fit to originate from a common xy vertex, a combined S-z fit is performed to determine an initial approximation of the vertex z position and of the track polar angles. The vertex-fitted CJC tracks are then combined with hits found in the z chambers, employing a robust global minimisation technique [65]. This link improves the z vertex resolution from about 1 cm to 1 mm. The track \u03b8 resolution is correspondingly improved from approximately 10 mrad to 1 mrad. For the NVX sample, where the z coordinate of the interaction vertex is around zero, the CJC tracks are also combined with hits found in the CST resulting in a vertex resolution of about 0.1 mm. CST hits are not used for the SVX sample since the interaction vertex position is outside the CST acceptance.",

At larger values of y \u03a3 the efficiency decreases again, the effect being more pronounced in the data than in the simulation. The reason for this difference is a deficit of events with a large rapidity gap in the DJANGOH model, as already observed in [35]. This is accounted for by applying a correction to the MC simulation. The systematic error of the cross section resulting from this correction is found to decrease with increasing Q 2 , from 10% to 2%. A special procedure is developed to determine the BST inefficiency. Two main sources of inefficiency are distinguished which are both closely related to the readout procedure. The first is a hit finding inefficiency, which mostly depends on the performance of the front-end amplifier readout chip (APC). This efficiency is determined for each APC using BST tracks, requiring hits reconstructed in all but the BST plane under investigation.

At lowest y, the hadronic final state is produced at small polar angles and partially escapes the LAr acceptance. In this case, simulation and data agree within 10%. The systematic uncertainty of the hadronic scale is therefore extrapolated linearly in log y, from 10% at y \u03a3 = 10 \u22123 to 2% at y \u03a3 = 10 \u22122 .

Hadronic energy calibration of the SpaCal For large values of y 0.4, the contribution of the SpaCal to the total E-P z becomes larger than the combined contribution of the LAr calorimeter and tracks. Given the accurate knowledge of the SpaCal linearity after calibration (Sect. 8.2.2), the study of E-P z as a function of E e allows a check of both the linearity and the absolute scale of the SpaCal hadronic measurement to be made. The E-P z distribution is studied for E e > 7 GeV in E e intervals of 1 GeV. For each interval, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is performed to estimate a possible shift in the E-P z distribution between data and simulation. For the SVX analysis, the data and the simulation agree well within their statistical uncertainties, while for the NVX data sample a global shift of \u223c1 GeV is observed. This shift is applied in the NVX analysis to the simulated events. An additional systematic uncertainty, (E-P z ) SpaCal = 0.5 GeV, is considered for both SVX and NVX analyses.

The consistency of the cross section measurement for a given data set (e.g. NVX) and a given reconstruction method (e.g. the electron method with \u03b8 e measured by the BST) is studied by splitting the data into two approximately equal sub-samples and comparing these sub-samples to each other. The data are compared as measured with the upper and the lower half of the SpaCal, for negative and positive z-vertex positions, and dividing the sample into an early and late data taking period.

In most of the cases the measurements with each of the samples agree within the uncorrelated statistical uncertainty. In a few cases the measurements agree within the total uncertainty only.

The uncertainty of the new data is typically 3-4% and larger at the acceptance edges. Lowest values of Q 2 , down to 0.2 GeV 2 , are reached with the shifted vertex data. The analysis of the SVX data is mainly based on the BST but complemented by an independent analysis using the BDC at lower radii. For Q 2 between 0.5 and 3.5 GeV 2 , the NVX and SVX cross section data overlap in their kinematic coverage and are observed to be in agreement. The kinematic region of larger Q 2 \u2265 5 GeV 2 is covered by the nominal vertex data. The data at highest y, corresponding to smallest x, are obtained using the dedicated trigger S9 and can be seen in Fig. 27 to be consistent with the behaviour of \u03c3 r towards small x.",

This simple parametrisation has been shown to model the ep data well for x < 0.01. This idea can be extended to fit the reduced cross section \u03c3 r in order simultaneously to extract the exponent \u03bb and to estimate the longitudinal structure function F L . The measured ep cross section is sensitive to the longitudinal structure function F L only for large y 0.5, a region which corresponds to a limited x range for a given Q 2 value. Gluon dominance at low x suggests that the function F L may exhibit an x dependence similar to F 2 . In the subsequent studies using this ansatz it is assumed that F L is proportional to F 2 and that the coefficient of proportionality depends only on Q 2 . For the extraction of F L , the ratio of \u03c3 L /\u03c3 T = R is used such that",

The same prescription is followed as for the \u03bb parameterisation fit described in Sect. 10.1 taking the F L contribution to be proportional to F 2 . The values of R are found to be consistent with the \u03bb fit and with being independent of Q 2 . Thus for the fractal parameterisation of the reduced cross section, R is taken to be a constant, which results in the simple five parameter representation used in the present analysis. The parameters of the fit are given in Table 7. The fit describes the data well with \u03c7 2 / n dof = 155.3/(149 \u2212 5). Similarly to the \u03bb fit, the value of R = 0.56 \u00b1 0.07 is consistent within about one standard deviation with R = 0.5.
