            "text": "FCC-hh is a proposed future energy-frontier hadron collider, which goal is to provide high luminosity proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. The FCChh has an extremely rich physics program ranging from standard model (SM) measurements to direct searches for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). One of the processes sensitive to new physics is flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) that extremely rare in the SM but have enhanced behavior in several BSM scenarios. In this report we present results of projections of FCNC searches in top quark interactions to the FCC-hh conditions based on Monte-Carlo simulation of FCC-hh detector.",

The predicted SM branching fractions for top quark FCNC decays are expected to be O(10 \u221212 \u2212 10 \u221217 ) [2] and are not expected to be detectable at the FCC-hh experimental sensitivity. However, certain scenarios beyond the SM (BSM), such as two-Higgs doublet model, warped extra dimensions and minimal supersymmetric models, incorporate significantly enhanced FCNC behavior that can be directly probed at the future collider experiments [2]. Observation of such processes would be a clear signal of new physics.",

On the other hand due to the expected increase of the energy of future collider experiments a significant number of events will contain high-energetic, boosted objects that require an exploration of different analysis strategy. We study the sensitivity of the FCC-hh to t \u2192 q\u03b3 and t \u2192 qH FCNC transitions using the pp \u2192 tt \u2192 tq\u03b3 and pp \u2192 tt \u2192 tqH processes respectly where q is a u or c quark. The analyzes exploit the boosted regime where top-quark p T is much larger than its mass. The signature of the signal processes includes high transverse momentum t-jet and a fat jet clustered from collinear photon or Higgs decay products and lightflavour jet. Resolved analysis of the FCNC in tq\u03b3 via single top production in association with photon is described in [3]. In [4] study of the FCNC in tqH has covered the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. In this analyses the dominant Higgs decay channel H \u2192 bb is explored. The study is based on \"fast\" simulation of the \"reference\" FCC-hh detector [5,6,7]. Figure 1.
