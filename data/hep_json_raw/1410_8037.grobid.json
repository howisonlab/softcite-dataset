These atoms have been studied in many fundamental physics experiments, such as precision measurements of proton size [1] and nuclear quadrupole moments [2]. Muonic atoms with pions in the core have been produced from intense K l beam at Brookhaven National Lab [3] and Fermilab [4]. However hydrogen-like muonic atoms with more exotic particles in the core (kaons or antiproton) have never been observed. Heavy-ion experiments, with large amount of thermal muons and hadrons produced, make an ideal environment for the production of such exotic atoms. This provides us a great opportunity to make these discoveries.",

            "text": "Muons that are involved in the atom production make the study particularly interesting in heavy-ion experiments, because thermal leptons are considered to be ideal penetrating probes of hot QCD matter as their production rates rapidly increase with the temperature of the medium. However, one difficulty of measuring the thermal leptons is that they are mixed with a large amount of leptons from weak hadronic decays, which carry little information of the hot and dense matter. Muonic atoms are only produced by particles right after freeze-out, i.e. hadrons and thermal muons or muons from resonance decays like \u03c1 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , not by the muons from the weak hadronic decays, which are produced at a relatively late stage. Thus the idea of measuring the distributions of muonic atoms in heavy-ion collisions has been suggested by several theorists, Melvin Schwartz, Gordon Baym, Gerald Friedman, [5], Joseph Kapusta, Agnes Mocsy, [6] etc. is limited to 0.15-0.25 GeV/c to ensure the purity of the sample. The corresponding momenta for kaons and protons/antiprotons are 0.7-1.17 GeV/c and 1.33-2.22 GeV/c respectively.",

The correlation as a function of k * , which is the magnitude of the momentum of either particle in the pair rest frame, shows how the interactions of the two particles change with respect to their distance in phase space. STAR has thoroughly studied the K-\u03c0 system [9], in which only Coulomb interation dominates. For non-identified particles, a leading particle can be selected, and two cases can be distinguished by C + (k * ) and C \u2212 (k * ), which stand for the leading particle travels faster and slower, respectively. Then the double ratio C + (k * )/C \u2212 (k * ) can be calculated to show the difference of the two cases. This method was successfully used in previous measurements to probe the space-time asymmetry of the emission of two particles [9]. The measurement of K-\u03c0 system is performed from the dataset and kinetic region similar as K-\u00b5 system which we used for muonic atom signal extraction. The origin of the non-unity in double ratio comes from the Coulomb interactions between the kaons and pions, which are later on enhanced in C + (k * ) and suppressed in C \u2212 (k * ) because of the spacetime emission asymmetries of kaons and pions. The double ratio of K \u2212 \u00b5 system, overlaid on top of K-\u03c0 system, can be separated in two regions as shown in Fig. 2. On the right of the dashed line, where only Coulomb interactions are expected in both systems, the double ratios of the two systems are consistent. This is consistent with the existence of the Coulomb force, which is a necessary condition to form muonic atoms. On the left of the dashed line, where the muonic atoms are expected to appear, when getting to very low k * , instead of divergence, the double ratios of K \u2212 \u00b5 system show convergence to unity. The unity double ratio provides a signature of muonic atoms disassociation at the detector beam pipe, where the hadrons and the muons are separated from the bound state at the same space-time point.",

C is then estimated by \u03c0-\u03c0 correlations, because of the fact that pion mass and muon mass are fairly close.
