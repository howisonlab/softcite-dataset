The branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 is measured to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 ) = (2.14 \u00b1 0.18(stat) \u00b1 0.25(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 .

            "text": "The nature of the lightest scalar meson nonet has been a hot topic in hadron physics for many years [1,2]. In particular, the nature of the isovector a 0 (980) is still not understood. It could be interpreted to be a qq state with a possible admixture of a KK bound-state component due to the proximity to the KK threshold [2][3][4][5], and it could also be interpreted as possible di-quarkanti-diquark bound states or loosely bounded mesonantimeson molecule states [6,7]. The a 0 (980) mass is known to be about 980 MeV and the dominant decay mode is a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0. The radiative decay of the J/\u03c8 to the enigmatic scalar meson a 0 (980) will provide useful information on the nature of a 0 (980) state [8,9].",

The average singlewire resolution is 135 \u00b5m, and the momentum resolution for 1 GeV/c charged particles in a 1 T magnetic field is 0.5%. (2) a time-of-flight system (TOF) used for particle identification. It is composed of a barrel made of two layers, each consisting of 88 pieces of 5 cm thick and 2.4 m long plastic scintillators, as well as two end caps with 96 fan-shaped, 5 cm thick, plastic scintillators in each end cap. The time resolution is 80 ps in the barrel and 110 ps in the end caps, providing a K/\u03c0 separation of more than 2\u03c3 for momenta up to about 1.0 GeV/c. (3) an electro-magnetic calorimeter (EMC) used to measure photon energies. The EMC is made of 6240 CsI (Tl) crystals arranged in a cylindrical shape (barrel) plus two end caps. For 1.0 GeV photons, the energy resolution is 2.5% in the barrel and 5% in the end caps, and the position resolution is 6 mm in the barrel and 9 mm in the end caps.

The potential background contribution is studied using both data and MC samples. The background events from the data are selected using the \u03c0 0 sidebands, defined in Sec. III. In addition, the background events are studied with the inclusive J/\u03c8 MC sample; the background events with the same final state are found to be from the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) decays. Apart from these two background channels, other background contributions are found to be represented by the \u03c0 0 sidebands. To scale the background events from the \u03c0 0 sideband regions to the signal region, a normalization factor f is defined as the ratio of the number of background events in the \u03c0 0 signal region and in the \u03c0 0 sideband regions. To obtain f , we fit to the \u03c0 0 mass spectrum a combination of the \u03c0 0 signal shape, obtained from the exclusive signal MC, combined with a third order Chebychev polynomial to represent the background distribution. The polynomial background is integrated in the signal region (s 1 ) and in the sideband regions (s 2 ) and the normalization factor is found to be f = s1 s2 = 1.09. To obtain the number of \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 events, an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the mass spectrum of the \u03b7 candidates, in the \u03c0 0 signal and sideband regions separately. The \u03b7 signals are parametrized by the shape obtained from the signal MC. The background shape is described by a third order Chebychev polynomial.

The detection efficiency, \u03b5 rec = (24.5 \u00b1 0.2) %, is obtained from the simulated signal events. The resulting branching fraction is calculated to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 ) = (2.14\u00b10.18)\u00d710 \u22125 . We also investigate the intermediate resonant process J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 , where X stands for a 0 (980) or a 2 (1320). The \u03b7\u03c0 0 invariant mass spectrum in the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 signal regions is shown in Fig. 4. We perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to determine the branching fractions of the radiative J/\u03c8 decays into these two mesons. For the a 0 (980) signal shape, we use the F latt\u00e9 formula [29] with the parameters from the KK model [30], while the a 2 (1320) signal shape is described by a Breit-Wigner (BW) function with the mass and width taken from PDG [2]. The a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320) signal shapes are convoluted with corresponding resolution functions, and multiplied by the efficiency distribution. The resolution and efficiency as functions of the \u03b7\u03c0 0 invariant mass are obtained using the signal MC sample. The resolution function is modeled by a sum of two Gaussians, with central values, widths and ratios fixed to the values obtained by analyzing the mass resolutions of the a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320) resonances. The background shape consists of a third order Chebychev polynomial and two functions for the background channels J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 2\u03c0 0 \u03b7 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9, where the two functions are obtained from histograms, and the background levels are obtained from MC study.  The spectrum in Fig. 5 is obtained from the fit to the first region, [0.8, 2.0] GeV/c 2 . The event yields are 5 \u00b1 10 for a 0 (980) and 57 \u00b1 20 for a 2 (1320). The statistical significance is 0.5\u03c3 for a 0 (980) and 2.9\u03c3 for a 2 (1320). Using a Bayesian method [2], we determine the upper limits for the a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320) production, at the 95% confidence level (C.L.), by finding the value N UL sig such that",

For the non-resonant \u03b7\u03c0 0 process, we replace the third-order Chebychev polynomial with a fourth-order Chebychev polynomial or the \u03b7\u03c0 0 distribution from the signal MC. We also fit the signals of a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320) together with background described above. All these variations are applied in three different mass regions: [0.8, 2.0] GeV/c 2 , [0.8, 1.92] GeV/c 2 and [0.8, 2.08] GeV/c 2 . In addition, the fractions of the background channels are varied within one standard deviation due to the MC statistics and the used branching fractions. The signal shapes are varied by using different parameters of the a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320) functions. In the F latt\u00e9 formula for the a 0 (980), the parameters from the KK model are substituted by the qq model and qqg model parameters [30,31]. In the case of the a 2 (1320), the mass and width of the BW function are varied within the uncertainties of the quoted values [2]. We take the largest upper-limit number of signal events among different models as a conservative estimate, where we have the upper limits N UL a0(980) = 33.8 corresponding to the qqg model, while N UL a2(1320) = 108 corresponding to a 1\u03c3 variation in the width for the a 2 (1320).",
