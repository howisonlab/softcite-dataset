            "text": "One of the key signatures of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is the modification of hadron transverse momentum differential cross-sections in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) as compared to proton-proton (pp) collisions. Suppression of hadron production at high transverse momenta (pT) in HIC has been explained by the energy loss of the partons produced in the hard scattering processes which traverse the deconfined quantum chromodynamic (QCD) matter. The dependence of the observed suppression on the pT of the measured hadron towards higher pT is an important input for the theoretical understanding of jet quenching effects in the QGP and the nature of the energy loss, while suppression towards lower pT gives information about collective behaviour. The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) performs a variety of measurements including the spectra of neutral mesons and kaons at mid-rapidity in a wide pT range in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. An overview of ALICE results in HIC and pp collisions at \u221a sNN =2.76 TeV of neutral pions, kaons and eta mesons as a function of transverse momentum (pT) and centrality will be presented. Ratios \u03b7/\u03c0 0 , K \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 as well as comparisons to model calculations will also be discussed.",

            "text": "Light mesons offer an opportunity to study the QGP and quantify its properties. At low p T , mesons give insight about bulk properties and collective effects. Particles with different masses are expected to be affected differently by the collective motion of the medium; one would thus expect a mass ordering of the nuclear modification factor R AA at low p T due to radial flow. At high p T , hadrons result from the hadronization of partons created in initial hard scattering. The suppression of hadron production at high p T in heavy-ion collisions is interpreted as energy loss of the scattered parton in the QGP. Gluons are expected to suffer a larger energy loss in the medium than quarks (Casimir factor). This effect may give rise to differences in suppression patterns between \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 which can be quantified with R AA measurements. While one would expect a larger energy loss of high p T partons at higher \u221a s, a smaller suppression may be observed at high p T due to a less steeply falling spectrum for a given magnitude of partonic energy loss. A smaller suppression at higher p T may additionally indicate a larger fractional quark to gluon partonic contribution to the production of mesons.",

PCM measurements use the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS [4]) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC [5]), measurements using this method have full azimuthal acceptance and 1.8 units of pseudo rapidity coverage. Charged particle identification is done via the specific energy loss (dE/dx) of particles traversing the TPC gas. The candidate signals are fitted with the sum of four Gaussian functions (Fig. 1) where the remaining contamination from electrons remains below 1%. Particle identification is further improved at p T < 4 GeV/c (K \u00b1 ) with the use of the Time of Flight (TOF) and the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID). Charged particles are detected up to p T = 20 GeV/c and at mid-  3. \u03c0 0 invariant yields in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV The ALICE experiment to this date has measured the invariant yields of \u03c0 0 at four \u221a s. The measurements indicate a power law dependence at high p T with a measured power value of n = 6.0 \u00b1 0.1 at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, a value lower than what has been observed with measurements performed at lower \u221a s energies [6]. The measurements are also compared to next-to-leading order pQCD (NLO pQCD) which use MSTW PDFs, and DSS14 fragmentation functions (FF) [7]. These comparisons as well as the ratio are illustrated in Fig. 2.",

A suppression of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 is observed via comparisons of the Pb-Pb invariant yields to scaled pp NLO pQCD. K \u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 suppression is observed via R AA which is p T and particle dependent (p T < 6 GeV/c). At high p T (> 8GeV/c) the value and trend of the R AA is particle independent pointing that the suppression may be a partonic effect alone. At low p T a mass hierarchy is observed on the magnitude of the R AA attributed to radial flow. Particle ratios measured in Pb-Pb collisions were presented and compared to jet quenching predictions as well as corresponding ratios measured in pp. K \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 reaches a constant value for p T > 4 GeV/c. For p T below 4 GeV/c an enhancement is observed which is centrality dependent. \u03b7/\u03c0 0 reaches a constant value for p T > 4 GeV/c. For p T below 4 GeV/c it is consistent with the pp and K \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 ratio. At high p T no significant differences are seen in the particle ratios between Pb-Pb and pp.",
