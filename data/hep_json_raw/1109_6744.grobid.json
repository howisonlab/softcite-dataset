Particle identification was performed using the energy loss signal in the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), while information from the Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector was used to identify particles at higher transverse momentum. From the spectra at \u221a s = 7 TeV the mean transverse momentum ( p t ) and particle ratios were extracted and compared to results obtained for collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and lower energies.",

It has to be measured, to provide an input for theoretical developments. In 2010 the LHC produced first proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, entering a new energy regime for such studies. Using its particle identification capabilities [1], the ALICE experiment was capable of measuring the pion, kaon and proton p t -spectra. The same measurements for \u221a s = 0.9 TeV proton-proton collisions collected in December 2009 were presented in [2], and they are used for comparison with the 7 TeV data.",

PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators were used together with GEANT3 transport code. The corrections for secondary protons and antiprotons (products of weak decays and interactions with detector material) were determined by comparing the distributions of the transverse impact parameter in data and simulations. For the TPCTOF method the same procedure was used to extract the pion contamination. For other methods this correction was based on simulations. All corrected spectra were calculated in the rapidity region |y| < 0.5. The rapidity selection was made using the relevant mass hypothesis for each particle types, detail description of that method can be found in [2]. Figure 1 demonstrates the agreement between the four different methods in p t =(0.0-1.2) GeV/c region. The agreement is well within the bounds of the total uncertainties (systematic and statistical added in a quadrature). The spectra from the four methods were combined by averaging, using the total uncertainties as weights. The combined spectra were normalized to the number of inelastic events [3,4] with \u00a7 Global tracks are reconstructed using information from the ITS and the TPC.",

The L\u00e9vy function also describes well the spectra measured by the ALICE experiment at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV proton-proton collisions [2]. The p t and the integrated yield ( dN dy ) for all particles were calculated from the L\u00e9vy function fits. To evaluate the systematic uncertainties different spectra extrapolation scenarios to the region not covered by the measurement were tested. The p t value for each particle type was taken the average p t value for positive and negative particles. The difference between p t measured for the positive and negative particles of that same species is much smaller than the extrapolation uncertainty. Figure 3 shows p t for \u03c0, K, p for different collisions energies. p t increases with energy and with the particle mass. Using the extrapolated values of the ( dN dy ) ratios (K + + K \u2212 )/(\u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 ), p/\u03c0 + andp/\u03c0 \u2212 were calculated.
