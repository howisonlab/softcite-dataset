We study the production of inclusive neutral Higgs boson in the \u03c4 \u03c4 final state and in association with a b quark in the b\u03c4 \u03c4 and bbb final states. These results are combined to improve the sensitivity to the production of neutral Higgs bosons in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The data are found to be consistent with expectation from background processes. Upper limits on MSSM Higgs boson production are set for Higgs boson masses ranging from 90 to 300 GeV. We exclude tan \u03b2 > 20 \u2212 30 for Higgs boson masses below 180 GeV. These are the most stringent constraints on MSSM Higgs boson production in pp collisions.",

Radiative corrections introduce additional dependencies on other model parameters. Although tan \u03b2 is a free parameter in the MSSM, some indications suggest it should be large (tan \u03b2 20). A value of tan \u03b2 \u2248 35 [2] would naturally explain the top to bottom quark mass ratio. The observed density of dark matter also points towards high tan \u03b2 values [3].",

In addition, they have similar couplings to fermions, which are enhanced (suppressed) by tan \u03b2 compared to the standard model (SM) for down-type (uptype) fermions. This enhancement has several consequences. First, the main decay modes become \u03c6 \u2192 bb and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with respective branching ratios B(\u03c6 \u2192 bb) \u2248 90 % and B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) \u2248 10 %. Secondly, the main production processes at a hadron collider involve b quarks originating from the sea. Inclusive Higgs boson production is dominated by gluon fusion (gg\u03c6) and bb annihilation (bb\u03c6), as shown in Fig. 1. The latter process may produce a b quark in the acceptance of the detector in addition to the Higgs boson. This associated production gb \u2192 \u03c6b (bgb\u03c6) is shown in Fig. 1c. In this case, the detection of the associated b quark is a powerful experimental handle for reducing backgrounds.",

The CDF and D0 Collaborations have searched for MSSM neutral Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs both inclusively [5,6] and in association with a b quark [7]. The D0 Collaboration has also searched for b\u03c6 \u2192 bbb production [8], which is challenging due to the high rate of multijet (MJ) production. Since these results have comparable sensitivities, combining them further enhances the potential reach. Recently, similar searches were performed at the LHC [9,10]. In this Letter, we present a combination of three searches performed by the D0 collaboration in the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , b\u03c6 \u2192 b\u03c4 \u03c4 , and b\u03c6 \u2192 bbb final states. Since the inclusive and bgb\u03c6 production signal samples in the di-tau final states are not mutually exclusive, the D0 result presented in [6] can not be directly combined with [7]. Hence, we re-analyse here the inclusive \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 production: we require that there are no b jets, we extend the dataset to 7.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, and we increase the trigger acceptance and refine the treatment of systematic uncertainties. The ditau channels are restricted to final states where one \u03c4 lepton (\u03c4 \u00b5 ) decays via \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd \u03c4 and the other (\u03c4 h ) decays hadronically.",

It has a central-tracking system, consisting of a silicon microstrip tracker and a central fiber tracker, both located within a 2 T superconducting solenoidal magnet, with designs optimised for tracking and vertexing at pseudorapidities [12] |\u03b7| < 3 and |\u03b7| < 2.5, respectively. A liquid-argon and uranium calorimeter has a central section covering pseudorapidities |\u03b7| up to \u2248 1.1, and two end calorimeters that extend coverage to |\u03b7| \u2248 4.2, with all three housed in separate cryostats [13]. An outer muon system, at |\u03b7| < 2, consists of a layer of track-ing detectors and scintillation trigger counters in front of 1.8 T toroids, followed by two similar layers after the toroids. The integrated luminosities (L) [14] associated with each search are summarized in Table I. Di-tau events were recorded using a mixture of single high-p T muon, jet, tau, muon plus jet, and muon plus tau triggers. The efficiency of this inclusive trigger condition is measured in a Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h data sample with respect to single muon triggers. We also verify this measurement in a sample of Z(\u2192 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h )+jets events. Depending on the kinematics and on the decay topology of the \u03c4 h , the trigger efficiency ranges from 80% to 95%. For the bbb analysis, we employ triggers selecting events with at least three jets. Most of the bbb data sample was recorded with b-tagging requirements at the trigger level. The trigger efficiency for m \u03c6 = 150 GeV is approximately 60% for events passing the analysis requirements.",

The simulation of the Z boson kinematics is corrected by comparing a large sample of Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events in data and in the simulation.

The first is based on the small correlation between the electric charge of muon and \u03c4 h in MJ events. For each analysis, we select a data sample with identical criteria as the signal sample but with the two leptons having the same electric charge (SS). We subtract the residual contribution from other SM backgrounds from this MJ-dominated SS sample. We measure the ratio of the number of OS to SS events to be 1.09 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.07 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, in the \u03c4 \u03c4 and b\u03c4 \u03c4 channels. We then multiply the SS sample yields by this ratio. This method is used in the inclusive \u03c4 \u03c4 channel but it suffers from large statistical uncertainties of the b\u03c4 \u03c4 SS sample. Therefore, we develop an alternate method that uses a MJ-enriched control sample with identical requirements as applied to the signal samples but reversing the muon isolation criteria. In a MJ-dominated SS sample, obtained without any requirement on the number of jets (N jets ), the ratio of the probabilities for a muon of a MJ-event to appear isolated or not isolated, R iso/iso \u2261 P(\u00b5 iso |MJ)/P(\u00b5 iso |MJ), is measured as function of \u03b7 \u03c4 h , p \u03c4 h T , and leading-jet p T (if N jets > 0). The ratio R iso/iso is then applied to the distributions of the nonisolated-muon sample, predicting the MJ background in the two signal samples. This method is used in the b\u03c4 \u03c4 study. In each analysis, the alternate method is used to determine the systematic uncertainty on the MJbackground normalisation.",

Two separate likelihoods, one for the mass region 90 \u2264 M A < 140 GeV and the other for 140 \u2264 M A < 300 GeV, are used. The dominant heavy flavor multijet backgrounds are estimated using a data driven technique. The background in the triple b-tagged sample is estimated by applying a 2D-transformation in M bb and D bbb , derived from the ratio of the number of MC events in the triple and double b-tagged samples, to the double b\u2212tagged data sample. The method significantly reduces the sensitivity of the background model to the underlying kinematics of the simulated events and the modelling of the geometric acceptance of the detector. The appropriate composition of the simulated samples is determined by comparing the sum of the transverse momenta of the jets in each event in simulation and data for various b-tagging criteria. The invariant mass distribution of the jet pairing with the highest D bbb value is used as the final discriminant. The distribution for the dominant 3-jet channel is shown in Fig. 3a. In Fig. 3b, good agreement is observed between the data and background model in a control sample selected using an inverted likelihood criterion D bbb < 0.12. III: Observed data yield and expected signal yields in the bbb channel. The signal yields are given for the scenario described in Table II. ",
