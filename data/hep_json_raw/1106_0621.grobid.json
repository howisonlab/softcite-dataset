The STAR experiment at RHIC has continuous azimuthal coverage with electromagnetic calorimeters for pseudo-rapidity from -1 to 4. We have measured forward+mid-rapidity \u03c0 0 \u2212\u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u2212h azimuthal correlations and forward+forward rapidity \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 azimuthal correlations. Both analyses use the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) triggered data in RHIC 2008 run p+p and d+Au collisions at \u221a sNN =200 GeV. The end-cap electromagnetic calorimeter (EEMC) at STAR covers pseudorapidity from 1.07 to 2. This provides us sensitivity to the nuclear gluon density at intermediate x values. Preliminary results on the \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 + jet-like azimuthal correlations with both the FMS and the EEMC will be discussed.",

            "text": "Deep inelastic scattering experiments show that the nucleon gluon density increases rapidly as Bjorken-x (x BJ ) decreases [1]. The increase at low x BJ is due to partons splitting into more partons. As the gluon density increases, two partons recombining into one becomes increasingly likely. When parton recombination compensates parton splitting, the number of partons will stop increasing and parton saturation is realized. At a given x BJ , the nuclear (mass number A) gluon density is approximately A 1/3 times the nucleon gluon density [2]. Consequently, saturation in the nuclear gluon density is expected to be realized at higher x BJ region than for the nucleon gluon density at fixed Q 2 .",

A threshold bounded cluster finder was developed to identify clusters' energy deposition from connected towers of the EEMC(BEMC). The threshold is tuned to discriminate energy deposition of particles produced by collisions from electronic noise and background. Assuming all clusters are photons, neutral pions are identified from cluster pair mass distributions ( Figure  2). The ratio of the leading tower energy to the cluster energy is selected to be > 0.9 to suppress background such as hadronic showers. To reduce the detector edge bias, there are fiducial volume selections: 1.1 < \u03b7 < 1.9 for EEMC and \u22120.9 < \u03b7 < 0.9 for BEMC. Energy sharing between cluster pairs is defined by the energy difference over the cluster pair energy sum. The energy sharing ratio is chosen to be < 0.7 to reduce non-\u03c0 0 background. The mass distributions of cluster pairs are in agreement with previous BEMC \u03c0 0 results both in p+p and d+Au runs.

The STAR calorimeters are primarily sensitive to electromagnetic shower energy and only partially sensitive to hadronic shower energy. Consequently, a jet cone algorithm developed from the threshold bounded cluster finder identifies jet-like clusters rather than jets. Initially, we defined a jet-like cluster by using cluster as seed, cone radius R = 0.5 (R : \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03d5 2 ), and only one iteration. Later on, with more studies including comparisons between data and simulation, we improved the algorithm by using jet cone radius R = 0.6 and multiple iterations to get stable jet-like clusters. Triggered neutral pions are detected in the FMS with transverse momentum p F M S t > 2.5GeV /c and 2.5 < \u03b7 < 4.0. Associated jet-like clusters are detected in the EEMC with transverse momentum 1.5GeV /c < p EEM C t < p F M S t and 1.1 < \u03b7 < 1.9. Jet-like clusters with mass > 0.2GeV /c 2 are chosen for the correlation analysis to suppress clusters that are only a single \u03c0 0 , and hence are not explicitly jet-like. The cross section for forward particle productions drops rapidly as p t grows, so lower p t cuts are chosen to compare data and simulation. From the jet-like invariant mass distribution (Figure 4), data and simulation are consistent both in p+p and d+Au collisions. The consistency between azimuthal correlations in data and simulation was also checked. The coincident probability (efficiency uncorrected) of azimuthal angle differences between FMS \u03c0 0 and EEMC jet-like candidates are shown in Figure 5 with FMS \u03c0 0 p F M S t > 2.5GeV /c and EEMC jet-like candidate 1.5GeV /c < p",

The width of the peak centered at \u2206\u03d5 = \u03c0 in d+Au is significantly broader than that in p+p (\u03c3 dAu \u2212 \u03c3 pp = 0.131 \u00b1 0.016). This indicates that the system in d+Au collisions is approaching saturation at the small Bjorken-x region 0.003 < x BJ < 0.02. Systematic studies using a random seed in detector coverage and repeating same jet-like clusters algorithm show similar correlation results. Underlying events are also studied with a random seed and a single iteration of the jet finder. These studies show that the jet-like clusters pick up more events in the peak rather than the pedestal compared to the underlying events.  ",

The FMS-EEMC correlations fill in the region between forward+mid rapidity correlations and forward+forward rapidity correlations to provide a fuller picture of the saturation boundary. Azimuthal correlations between a neutral pion in the FMS and jet-like clusters in the EEMC are found to have a broader back-to-back peak in d+Au collisions than in p+p collisions. Combined with earlier studies, this suggests a smooth transition from low to high parton densities.",

Azimuthal correlations in FMS+EEMC with lower p t cuts are being studied. The forward+forward correlations in d+Au collisions shows dependency on centrality selections [12]. The STAR Beam-Beam Counter(BBC) multiplicity provides a measure of centrality of the event. Therefore, the azimuthal correlations in d+Au interaction can be divided into peripheral and central part with different multiplicity selections. Comparison between d+Au central collisions and d+Au peripheral collisions will be studied.",
