The LEMMA project is investigating the possibility of producing low emittance muon/antimuon pairs from the e + e \u2212 annihilation process at threshold energy, resulting in small transverse emittance beams without any additional beam cooling. However most of the measurements available are performed at higher \u221a s values. It is therefore necessary to measure muons production in positron annihilation at threshold energy and compare the experimental results with the predictions in this specific energy regime. Apart from being a topic of physical interest by itself, these near to threshold measurements can have a sizeable impact on the estimation of the ultimate luminosity achievable in a muon collider with the LEMMA injection scheme.",

A muon collider facility has been studied and designed by the MAP project [1]. This study demonstrated that a muon collider is feasible up to 6 TeV hence exploring the multi-TeV energy frontier with the possibility to study Higgs boson properties. However a muon collider has to face several challenges. The muon lifetime of 2.2 \u00b5sec at rest requires a fast accelerator chain. The production of low emittance muon/antimuon beams to be fed into the accelerator complex imposes the use of fast muon cooling techniques [2] when muons are produced by decay of pions.",

All relevant volumes, silicon detectors, calorimeters, muon chambers and iron shielding, have been simulated with their exact shape and material composition in order to correctly model energy loss and multiple scattering. As far as primary particles are concerned, several options have been implemented: besides the possibility to simulate a 45 GeV positron beam along the z-axis, with characteristics similar to the experimantal one, also the possibility to use a \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs input file in the HEPMC format has been implemented. This allowed the simulation of a sufficient amount of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events within a reasonable time, given the very low cross section of the annihilation process. Similarly, the possibility to simulate Bhabha events via external input files has been implemented. The magnetic field could be described in two ways: either with the measured field map provided for the specific magnet and running current used in the experiment or with an effective constant dipole value inside the magnet footprint. It was checked using simulations that the two descriptions lead to very similar results and hence the second option was used. The output of the simulation is given on a particle basis recording each interaction in any of the volumes. positrons. As anticipated in Sec. 3.1, the spot size was \u223c 2 x 2 cm 2 with a typical angular spread of \u223c 300 \u00b5rad. With the chosen collimators setting the momentum spread was below 1.5 % [13]. The purity of the beam was in the range 95-99 % [14]. The goal of the data analysis is to identify e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events, measure the muon trajectories and the interacting positron direction in the x z plane and the muon momenta in the bending plane. The main background process was the Bhabbha scattering e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . Most of the electrons did not have enough energy to pass through the calorimeters, therefore events with two muons, one for each arm, were identified by requiring one track per DT muon chamber. DT tracks were used as seeds for the pattern recognition. Hits were added starting from the DT chambers and moving backwards to the other detectors with the following procedure:",

The corresponding data and simulation shapes are compared in Fig. 3 separately for positive and negative reconstructed muon tracks. The reconstructed distributions show well collimated tracks, as expected from the Geant4 simulation. A similar comparison is performed for the reconstructed tracks momenta in Fig. 4. As expected from the simulation, the reconstructed distributions are almost flat in the range between 18 and 26 GeV. As a trivial consequence of energy conservation in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 on a target at rest, the sum of the muons momenta should peak at the fixed energy of the incoming positron beam. The observed experimental spread depends mostly on the muon track momentum resolution convoluted with the energy spread of the incoming positron beam. The measured shape is shown in Fig. 5 and compared to a simulation obtained by smearing the generated muon track momenta by 3%. This resolution is consistent with what obtained from single muon calibration runs with fixed momentum in the range 18 and 26 GeV. A few data points occur at values about 10% smaller than the main peak, around 40 GeV. A similar behaviour is also seen when analyzing single muon calibration runs. Hence events around 40 GeV are more likely to be due to non Gaussian tails in the momentum reconstruction rather than being an unwanted background contribution or arising from a tail in the momentum distribution of the incoming positron beam. The last kinematic quantity considered is the invariant mass of the two muon tracks, Fig. 6.",

Several unexpected difficulties during the acquisition campaigns lead to a yield of 61 events. However for these events both the incoming positron and the outgoing muons are well measured and correlated. So these can be 1The vacuum pipe reduces the angular spread by a factor \u223c 2. used to get a first estimate of the raw emittance that, within the large data statistical uncertainty, is consistent with analytical calculations and more detailed simulations of the full detector setup. These data also allowed a comparison of the observed uncorrected x distribution to simulations. A fair agreement is found. In order to subtract the large emittance of the incoming positron beam from the measured raw muon emittance i.e. to provide a measurement of the achievable muon beam emittance independent from the incoming positron beam characteristics, more accurate tracking devices, alignment infrastructures and more efficient trigger and readout systems will be needed. Such a setup could then be used for measurements of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 production cross section near threshold. Several accelerator technologies studies, like the development of a muon collider with the LEMMA injection scheme, could benefit from these measurements.",
