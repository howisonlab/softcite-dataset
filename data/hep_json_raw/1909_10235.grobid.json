In the Standard Model (SM) the fermion masses are generated via Yukawa interactions. The Yukawa couplings to thirdgeneration fermions were determined by measurements of Higgs boson production and decays [9][10][11][12][13][14][15], and found to be in agreement with the expectations of the SM. However, there is currently no evidence of Higgs boson decays into first-or second-generation quarks or leptons.",

The CMS Collaboration has previously performed searches for H \u2192 ee [16] and H \u2192 e\u03bc [17]  The LHC offers the best constraint on Y ee [18], which may be larger than predicted by the SM. The SM forbids lepton-flavournumber-violating Higgs boson decays. There are strong indirect constraints on the off-diagonal Y e\u03bc coupling, the strongest derived from limits on the branching fraction of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and the electric dipole moment of the electron [19]. However, these indirect constraints assume SM values for the as yet unmeasured Y ee and Y \u03bc\u03bc Yukawa couplings. Searching for H \u2192 e\u03bc allows Y e\u03bc to be constrained directly.",

The signal is separated from the background primarily by identifying a narrow peak in the distribution of the invariant mass of the two leptons m corresponding to the mass of the Higgs boson of 125 GeV [21]. The background in the ee search is dominated by Drell-Yan (DY) Z /\u03b3 * production, with smaller contributions from top-quark pair (tt) and diboson production ( Z Z , W Z and W W ). In the e\u03bc search, a much smaller yield of SM background events is expected. The DY background only contributes through decays of Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd e \u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd \u03bc . Thus the production of top quarks, dibosons (mainly through W W \u2192 e\u03bd e \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc ), W +jets and multijet events, with jets misidentified as leptons, are more important than in the ee search.",

            "text": "of m H = 125 GeV were generated as described below and processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation [26] based on GEANT4 [27]. Higgs boson production via the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) process was simulated using the POWHEG NNLOPS program [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35] with the PDF4LHC15 set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) [36]. The Higgs boson rapidity in the simulation was reweighted to achieve next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD [37]. Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion (VBF) and with an associated vector boson (V H) were generated at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD using the POWHEG-BOX program [38][39][40]. The Z H samples were simulated for processes with quark-quark initial states, and the small contribution from gluon-gluon initial states is accounted for in the normalisation of the Z H cross section. The parton-level events were processed with PYTHIA8 [41] for the decay of the Higgs bosons into the ee or e\u03bc final states and to simulate parton showering, hadronisation and the underlying event, using the AZNLO set of tuned parameters [42]. All samples were normalised to state-ofthe-art predictions using higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections . The effects arising from multiple pp collisions in the same or neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up) were included in the simulation by overlaying inelastic pp interactions generated with PYTHIA8 using the NNPDF2.3LO set of PDFs [67] and the A3 set of tuned parameters [68]. Events were reweighted such that the distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing matches that observed in data. Simulated events were corrected to reflect the lepton energy scale and resolution, and trigger, reconstruction, identification and isolation efficiencies measured in data.",

In addition, theoretical modelling uncertainties affecting the acceptance for the signals are calculated separately for the ggF and VBF Higgs boson production processes in each analysis category. The uncertainty in the acceptance for the V H process is neglected. The effects of missing higher-order terms in the perturbative QCD calculations are estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales. For the ggF process the uncertainties are approximated as two correlated sources that range from around 1% to 11% for the different analysis categories in both channels. For the VBF process the uncertainties in the acceptance due to the QCD scales are found to be small. The effects of uncertainties in the parton distribution functions and the value of \u03b1 S are estimated using the PDF4LHC15 recommendations [36] and found to be very small. The uncertainty in the modelling of the parton shower, underlying event, and hadronisation is assessed by comparing the acceptance of signal events showered by PYTHIA with that of events showered by HERWIG [90,91]. The total variations due to these uncertainties range from less than 1% to 11% for the ggF signal process and from 1% to 8% for the VBF signal process depending on the analysis category. Due to the very different yields and composition of the backgrounds in the ee and e\u03bc channels, the potential bias on the measured signal from the choice of background function is assessed in different ways. In the ee channel the S + B fit is repeated using the high-statistics DY-background fast simulation instead of the data. The number of signal events in each category obtained from the fit is used as a systematic uncertainty following the method of Ref. [1]. To be conservative, the maximum absolute deviation from zero for a signal mass between 120 and 130 GeV is taken. The uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated between categories. The background modelling uncertainty is implemented as a set of additional nuisance parameters acting on the signal normalisation in each category. The effect of this uncertainty on the expected limit is about 8%. In the e\u03bc channel the background modelling uncertainty is estimated by changing the fit function to an exponential and evaluating the difference in signal yield compared with the default fit to a sample of simulated background events [92][93][94]. The effect of this uncertainty on the expected limit is about 1%.",

Backgrounds with top quarks are suppressed by identifying b-hadrons and neutrinos in the final state. Jets in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5 containing b-hadrons are identified as b-jets using a multivariate algorithm that uses calorimeter and tracking information [81].

For the ee (e\u03bc) channel the b-jet identification efficiency is about 60% (85%) with a rejection factor of about 1200 (25) for light-flavour jets [82]. Neutrinos produced in semileptonic top-quark decays escape detection and lead to missing transverse momentum E miss T , reconstructed as the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all calibrated leptons and jets and additional ID tracks associated with the primary vertex (soft term) [83].

No evidence of either decay is found and observed (expected) upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the branching fractions of 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) for B(H \u2192 ee) and 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (5.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) for B(H \u2192 e\u03bc) are obtained for a Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV. These are the first such searches made by the ATLAS Collaboration and are considerable improvements on previous measurements.
