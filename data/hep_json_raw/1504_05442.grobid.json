            "text": "Sensitivity to \u03b3 in tree-level processes may be obtained through the study of CP-violating observables in the decays B \u2213 \u2192 Dh \u2213 , where D indicates a neutral charm meson which decays in a mode common to both D 0 and D 0 states, and h, the bachelor hadron, is either a kaon or a pion. In the case of B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 , interference occurs between the suppressed b \u2192 ucs and favored b \u2192 c\u016bs quark-level transitions and, similarly, for the chargeconjugate decay. The magnitude of the interference is governed by three parameters: the weak-phase difference, \u03b3, the CP-conserving strong-phase difference, \u03b4 B , and the ratio of the magnitudes of the two amplitudes, r B . Similar interference effects occur in the case when the bachelor hadron is a pion, but then additional Cabibbo suppression factors mean that the sensitivity to \u03b3 is much reduced. Many classes of D decay can be exploited. Important examples include the so-called Atwood-Dunietz-Soni (ADS) modes [6], which are decays to quasiflavor eigenstates such as D \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 AE , and the Gronau-London-Wyler (GLW) modes [7], which are decays to CP eigenstates such as D \u2192 K \u00fe K \u2212 . Measurements exist from LHCb that follow both the ADS and GLW approaches [8][9][10][11], as well as alternative methods [12,13].",

            "text": "In the case that the D meson decays to three or more hadrons, the interference effects that are sensitive to \u03b3 vary over the phase space of the D decay due to the role of strongly decaying intermediate resonances. If the D decay is analyzed inclusively, the integration over phase space in general dilutes the net sensitivity. For multibody ADS modes the dilution factor can be measured with DD pairs coherently produced at the \u03c8\u00f03770\u00de resonance [14]. LHCb has previously made use of such measurements performed with data from the CLEO-c experiment [15][16][17] in B AE \u2192 Dh AE analyses exploiting the modes D \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 AE \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe [9] and D \u2192 K 0 S K \u2213 \u03c0 AE [10]. It has recently been pointed out [18] that similar considerations apply to self-conjugate multibody modes such as D \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . These modes approximate to CP eigenstates and, hence, a B \u2213 \u2192 DK \u2213 analysis that employs them can be considered a quasi-GLW (qGLW) analysis. In this case the dilution factor is related to how closely the mode approaches a CP eigenstate, and can also be measured at the open charm threshold.",

            "text": "This paper presents the measurement of CP observables from B AE \u2192 Dh AE decays, where D mesons are reconstructed using three different multibody final states. These decays are the ADS channel D \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 AE \u03c0 0 and the qGLW modes D \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and D \u2192 K \u00fe K \u2212 \u03c0 0 . In all cases, higher sensitivity is attained compared with the results of the previous measurements which exist from the BABAR [19] and Belle [20] Collaborations for the ADS channel, and from BABAR for the mode D \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [21]. Measurements at the \u03c8\u00f03770\u00de resonance [15,16,18] indicate that the dilution effects in D \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 AE \u03c0 0 and D \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are rather small, making these decays particularly suitable for an inclusive analysis. This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the observables that the analysis seeks to measure, and explains how they are related to the underlying physics parameters and the dilution factors that are determined externally. Section III describes the LHCb detector and the data set on which the analysis is based. Sections IV and V present the candidate selection and the analysis procedure. Results are given in Sec. VI, together with a discussion of the systematic uncertainties. In Sec. VII the measured observables are interpreted in terms of \u03b3 and the other physics parameters, and conclusions are drawn.",

The coherence factor \u03ba K\u03c0\u03c0 0 D accounts for possible dilution effects in the interference arising from the contribution of the intermediate resonances in the D decay [14]. Both \u03b4 K\u03c0\u03c0 0 D and \u03ba K\u03c0\u03c0 0 D have been measured with quantum-correlated DD decays collected at the \u03c8\u00f03770\u00de resonance by the CLEO-c experiment, and have been found to be \u00f0164 \u00fe20 \u221214 \u00de\u00b0a nd 0.82 AE 0.07, respectively [15], where the phasedifference \u03b4 K\u03c0\u03c0 0 D is given in the convention where CPjD 0 i \u00bc jD 0 i. The relatively large value of \u03ba K\u03c0\u03c0 0 D means that the dilution effects are small and, hence, this decay is a promising mode to exploit for the measurement of \u03b3.

The LHCb detector [23,24] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a highprecision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout datataking in order to combat systematic biases due to possible detector asymmetries. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV=c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV=c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [25], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Off-line a loose selection based on a decision tree algorithm [26] is run to reduce the size of the sample prior to final analysis. Approximately one million simulated events (after geometric detector acceptance) of each class of signal decay are used in the analysis, as well as a large inclusive sample of generic B q \u2192 DX decays, where q \u2208 fu; d; sg. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using PYTHIA [27] with a specific LHCb configuration [28]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EVTGEN [29], in which final-state radiation is generated using PHOTOS [30]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the GEANT4 toolkit [31] as described in Ref. [32].",
