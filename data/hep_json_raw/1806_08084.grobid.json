            "text": "The \u039b 0 b baryon is the isospin-singlet ground state of a bound system of a beauty quark and two light quarks. The high production rate of b quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1-5], along with the excellent mass resolution and hadron-identification capabilities of the LHCb detector, give access to a variety of decay channels of the \u039b 0 b baryon, including multibody, rare, charmless and semileptonic decays [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. The high signal yield of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 decay [15] facilitated a precise measurement of the \u039b 0 b lifetime [26], while the relatively low energy released in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)pK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c7 c pK \u2212 decays allowed for precise measurements of the \u039b 0 b mass [16,22]. A six-dimensional amplitude analysis of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 decay resulted in the observation of the P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + pentaquark states decaying into the J/\u03c8 p final state [27]. Later, these states were confirmed using a model-independent technique [28]. Subsequently, an analysis of Cabibbo-suppressed \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays found evidence for contributions from the P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + pentaquarks and from the Z c (4200) \u2212 tetraquark [29].",

Later, the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)pK \u2212 was observed by the LHCb collaboration [16]. The Cabibbo-suppressed analogue of the latter decay, \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)p\u03c0 \u2212 , is of particular interest because of possible contributions from exotic states in both the \u03c8(2S)p system, similar to the P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + pentaquark states, and in the \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 system, analogous to the charged charmonium-like state Z c (4430) \u2212 studied in detail by the Belle and LHCb collaborations in B \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 K decays [31][32][33][34][35].

            "text": "The LHCb detector [38,39] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH). Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [40], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The hardware trigger selects muon candidates with high transverse momentum or dimuon candidates with high value of the product of the p T of each muon. The subsequent software trigger is composed of two stages, the first of which performs a partial event reconstruction, while full event reconstruction is done at the second stage. In the software trigger, each pair of oppositely charged muons forming a good-quality two-track vertex is required to be significantly displaced from all PVs and the mass of the pair is required to exceed 2.7 GeV/c 2 .",
