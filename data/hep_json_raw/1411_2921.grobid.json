            "text": "A generic search for anomalous production of events with at least three charged leptons is presented. The data sample consists of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Events are required to have at least three selected lepton candidates, at least two of which must be electrons or muons, while the third may be a hadronically decaying tau. Selected events are categorized based on their lepton flavour content and signal regions are constructed using several kinematic variables of interest. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed. Model-independent upper limits on contributions from beyond the Standard Model phenomena are provided for each signal region, along with prescription to re-interpret the limits for any model. Constraints are also placed on models predicting doubly charged Higgs bosons and excited leptons. For doubly charged Higgs bosons decaying to e\u03c4 or \u00b5\u03c4 , lower limits on the mass are set at 400 GeV at 95% confidence level. For excited leptons, constraints are provided as functions of both the mass of the excited state and the compositeness scale \u039b, with the strongest mass constraints arising in regions where the mass equals \u039b. In such scenarios, lower mass limits are set at 3.0 TeV for excited electrons and muons, 2.5 TeV for excited taus, and 1.6 TeV for every excited-neutrino flavour.",

            "text": "With the delivery and exploitation of over 20 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity at a centre-ofmass energy of 8 TeV in proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, many models of new physics now face significant constraints on their allowed parameter space. Final states including three or more charged, prompt, and isolated leptons have received significant attention, both in measurements of Standard Model (SM) diboson [1][2][3] and Higgs boson production [4,5], and in searches for new phenomena. Anomalous production of multi-lepton final states arises in many beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, including excited-lepton models [6,7], the Zee-Babu neutrino mass model [8][9][10], supersymmetry [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19], models with pair production of vector-like quarks [20], and models with doubly charged Higgs bosons [21,22] including Higgs triplet models [23,24]. An absence of significant deviations from SM predictions in previous measurements and dedicated searches motivates an inclusive search strategy, sensitive to a variety of production modes and kinematic features.",

The first model predicts the Drell-Yan production of doubly charged Higgs bosons [21,22], which then decay into lepton pairs.

Lepton-flavor-conserving decays are not considered in this paper. The second benchmark scenario is a composite fermion model predicting the existence of excited leptons [25]. The excited leptons, which may be neutral (\u03bd * ) or charged ( * ), are produced in a pair or in association with a SM lepton either through contact interactions or gauge-mediated processes. Their decay proceeds via the same mechanisms, with rates that depend on the lepton mass and a compositeness scale, \u039b.

These two channels are referred to as \u2265 3e/\u00b5 and 2e/\u00b5+ \u2265 1\u03c4 had respectively. Next, events are further divided into three categories. The first category includes events that contain at least one opposite-sign, same-flavour (OSSF) pair of leptons with an invariant mass within 20 GeV of the Z boson mass. This category also includes events in which an OSSF pair can combine with a third lepton to satisfy the same invariant mass requirement, allowing this category to capture events in which a Z boson decays to four leptons (e.g. via Z \u2192 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 ) or has some significant final-state radiation that is reconstructed as a prompt electron. This category is referred to as \"on-Z\". The second category is composed of events that contain an OSSF pair of leptons that do not satisfy the on-Z requirements; this category is labelled \"off-Z, OSSF\". The final category is composed of all remaining events, and is labelled \"no-OSSF\". The wide dilepton mass window used to define the on-Z category is chosen to reduce the leakage of events with real Z bosons into the off-Z categories, which would otherwise see larger backgrounds from SM production of ZZ, W Z, and Z+jets events. In \u2265 3e/\u00b5 events, the categorization is performed using only the three leading leptons (ordered by lepton p T ). In 2e/\u00b5+ \u2265 1\u03c4 had events, the categorization is performed using the two light-flavour leptons and the \u03c4 had candidate with the highest p T . The categorization always ignores any additional leptons.",

The \"effective mass\", m eff , is the scalar sum of E miss T , H jets T , and the p T of all identified leptons in the event.

In events in which two Z boson candidates can be formed from the three leading leptons, the candidate with mass closer to the pole mass is defined as the Z boson. Several of the categories and signal regions described above are new with respect to the analysis performed using the 7 TeV dataset [33]. The distinction between the off-Z, OSSF and the off-Z, no-OSSF categories is introduced, as are the signal regions defined using the variables p ,min T , m W T , and the number of b-tagged jets. As mentioned earlier, thresholds that define signal regions in the 7 TeV analysis are also raised to exploit the higher centre-of-mass energy and larger dataset at 8 TeV.",

These uncertainties are determined in dedicated studies using a combination of simulation and data. They account for potential biases in the methods used to extract the reweighting factors, and for the dependency of the reweighting factors on the event topology. The electron reweighting factors have uncertainties that range from 24% to 30% as a function of the electron p T , while for muons the uncertainties range from 25% to 50%. For the estimates of fake \u03c4 had candidates, the p T -dependent uncertainty on the reweighting factors is approximately 25%.

The relative uncertainty on the correction factors for electron charge-flip modelling in simulation is estimated to be 40%, resulting in a maximum uncertainty on the total background yield in any signal region of 11%. Studies of simulated data show that the majority of charge-flip electrons are due to bremmstrahlung photons that interact with detector material and convert to an electron-positron pair, yielding an energetic secondary lepton with the opposite sign of the prompt lepton.

Finally, both the \u2265 3e/\u00b5 and 2e/\u00b5+ \u2265 1\u03c4 had channels are used to maximize the total acceptance. Table 8 summarizes the expected acceptance, efficiency, and cross-section limit for several mass values, channels, and decay scenarios. The \u2265 3e/\u00b5 and 2e/\u00b5+ \u2265 1\u03c4 had channels have comparable sensitivity for high masses, and are therefore combined when setting the final limits to improve the overall constraint on this model.

Data distributions are compared to SM predictions in a variety of observables and final states, designed to probe a large range of BSM scenarios. Good agreement between the data and SM predictions is observed. Model-independent exclusion limits on visible cross sections are derived, and a prescription to re-interpret such limits for any model is presented. Additionally, limits are set on specific models predicting doubly charged Higgs bosons and excited leptons. Doubly charged Higgs bosons coupling to left-handed fermions and decaying exclusively to e\u03c4 or \u00b5\u03c4 pairs are constrained to have mass above 400 GeV at 95% confidence level. For excited leptons, the mass constraints depend on the compositeness scale, with the strongest mass constraints reached where the mass of the excited state and the compositeness scale are the same; the lower limits on the mass extend to 3.0 TeV for excited electrons and excited muons, 2.5 TeV for excited taus, and 1.6 TeV for every excited-neutrino flavour.",
