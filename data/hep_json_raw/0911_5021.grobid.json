There are many compelling models, for instance, supersymmetry and extra dimensions, which predict such signatures. On the other hand, same-sign lepton production is very suppressed in the Standard Model. Preparations are underway for this search using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which will take data at the LHC, scheduled to start running in 2009. The CMS detector has very good measurement capabilities for muons, electrons, jets and MET, and methods are being developed to perform sensitive searches using the first collected data. Using results from a previous Monte Carlo study based on this signature at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, we make discovery potential projections for the early 10 TeV LHC runs. While the results of these extrapolations are encouraging, they are based purely on Monte Carlo and, as such, should be considered only as a rough guide. Data-driven background estimations will be critical for the success of this analysis and are under development.",

If we assume an mSUGRA scenario with R-Parity conservation, missing energy is guaranteed in all of the three production mechanisms, while jets are guaranteed in the latter two. The OS/SS production ratio is largely dependent on the mass hierarchy between the squark and gluino. For example, if the gluino mass is significantly less than the squark mass, then we would expect nearly equal numbers of OS and SS dilepton events, since gluino-gluino production will dominate and gluinos are blind to charge. Also, the same-sign dilepton final state is a bit more favorable at the LHC than at the Tevatron because it is a proton-proton collider. The valence quarks are slightly more probable to have a same-sign initial state.",

            "text": "While arguments can be made to motivate the SS dilepton signature versus the OS dilepton signature based on possible production mechanisms, the more powerful argument comes from the physics backgrounds. The Standard Model simply does not produce same-sign, isolated dileptons very frequently, while it does produce oppositesign, isolated dileptons in relative abundance via Drell-Yan and top-antitop ( ! tt ) production. With the exception of diboson production, which is typically a second order weak interaction, there are simply no significant physics processes, which yield SS, isolated dileptons. This is not to say that the CMS detector will not reconstruct SS dilepton events from Standard Model processes [1]. There are spurious sources of SS dilepton events from charge mismeasurement or heavy flavor decays, which need to be considered. Data-driven measurements of these and other types of backgrounds are under active development in CMS.",

            "text": "Given the encouraging results from the 14 TeV study presented in Table 3, it is worth exploring the prospects of discovery with the data collected during the early era of LHC running at 10 TeV. Initial plans were to take anywhere from 100 pb -1 to 200 pb -1 of integrated luminosity during the 2009-2010 runs. Since we know the leading order crosssections at 14 TeV and 10 TeV for the backgrounds and the signal points, we can make projections of how this analysis would perform with the early data. From Table 2 we see that the signal cross-sections are reduced by a factor of roughly three. The ! tt crosssection is reduced by a factor of roughly two. We assume an optimistic scenario with 200 pb -1 of integrated luminosity, which corresponds to a reduction by a factor of 50 with respect to the previous study. An important update to this analysis, which is currently in progress, is the inclusion of electron-electron and electron-muon channel. It is expected that these additional final states will increase statistics by as much as a factor of three. Lepton universality would suggest an increase by a factor of four; however, electron reconstruction efficiency is anticipated to be slightly worse than that of muons at CMS. Thus, we have a simple formula to estimate the event yield for a given process,",

While this scaling exercise makes many assumptions about the efficiencies of the analysis cuts at this lower center-of-mass energy, especially in the case of the ! tt background, the results are encouraging. An argument can be made that the sensitivity to mSUGRA in the same-sign dilepton channel at 10 TeV is not lost, even with a modest amount of data.
