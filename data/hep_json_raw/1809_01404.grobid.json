Measurements of the differential cross-section and the forwardbackward production ratio are reported for \u039b + c baryons with transverse momenta in the range 2 < p T < 10 GeV/c and rapidities in the ranges 1.5 < y * < 4.0 and \u22124.5 < y * < \u22122.5 in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass system.

            "text": "The ultimate goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the SPS, RHIC and the LHC accelerators is to learn about the properties of a new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The QGP consists of deconfined quarks and gluons and it is generally accepted that such a hot and dense state of matter can be produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions [1]. Heavy quarks are particularly important probes of the properties of the QGP. According to theoretical models, heavy quarks are created in pairs in the early stage of the space-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, and undergo rescattering or energy loss in the QGP. Measurements of heavy-flavour production can shed light on the transport properties of the medium and the heavy-quark energy-loss mechanisms. Multiple experimental measurements of D-meson production in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC [2] and the LHC [3] already show clear signs of strong interactions between charm quarks and the medium in these collisions. However, heavy quarks can be affected by both hot and cold nuclear JHEP02(2019)102 matter, since cold nuclear matter effects are also present in nucleus-nucleus interactions. Possible cold nuclear matter effects that affect heavy-flavour production in heavy-ion collisions include: (a) the modification of the parton distribution function in bound nucleons in the initial state, namely the nuclear PDF (nPDF) effects [4,5]; (b) initial-state radiation or energy loss due to soft collisions [6][7][8]; and (c) final-state hadronic rescatterings and absorption [9]. To further study heavy-quark energy loss or collective phenomena in QGP, the cold nuclear matter effects must be quantitatively disentangled from hot nuclear matter effects.",

The excellent particle identification capabilities of the LHCb detector allow measurements of various species of charmed hadrons. Finally, prompt open-charm hadrons can be measured down to low transverse momentum (p T ) at forward rapidity (y) owning to the LHCb's geometric coverage.

In the present study, the production of the charmed baryon \u039b + c is measured with the same 2013 data sample. 1 The forward-backward asymmetry is measured using prompt \u039b + c candidates, in order to study cold nuclear matter effects. In addition, the baryon-to-meson cross-section ratios are measured in order to probe the charm-hadron formation mechanism [11,12] using D 0 production cross-sections measured by the LHCb collaboration in ref. [10]. Measurements of the baryon-to-meson cross-section ratios for light and strange hadrons have shown significant baryon enhancement at intermediate p T in the most central heavy-ion collisions [13,14]. This enhancement can be explained by coalescence models [11,[15][16][17][18], which assume that all hadrons are formed through recombination of partons during hadronisation. Recently, the STAR experiment has measured the production of \u039b + c baryons in AuAu collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [19]. These measurements show a significant enhancement in the \u039b + c to D 0 yield ratio for p T from 3 to 6 GeV/c. A similar enhancement in PbPb collisions is also observed by the ALICE experiment [20]. The measurement of \u039b + c production in pPb collisions provides complementary information to help understand the implications of the STAR and ALICE observations. In addition, the ALICE collaboration has recently measured \u039b + c production in pPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV for 2 < p T < 12 GeV/c and \u22120.96 < y < 0.04, and in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV for 1 < p T < 8 GeV/c and \u22120.5 < y < 0.5 [21].

            "text": "The LHCb detector [23,24] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region (VELO), a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. The average efficiency for kaon identification for momenta between 2 and 100 GeV/c is about 95%, with a corresponding average pion misidentification rate around 5%. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. This analysis uses the data sample of pPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV taken with the LHCb detector in 2013, with a proton beam energy of 4 TeV and lead beam energy of 1.58 TeV per nucleon in the laboratory frame. Since the LHCb detector covers only one direction of the full rapidity acceptance, two distinctive beam configurations were used. In the 'forward' ('backward') configuration, the proton (lead) beam travels from the VELO detector to the muon chambers. The rapidity y in the laboratory rest frame is shifted to y * = y \u2212 0.4645 in the proton-nucleon rest frame. Here, y * is the rapidity of the \u039b + c baryon defined in the centre-of-mass system of the colliding nucleons, and it is defined with respect to a polar axis in the direction of the proton beam. During data taking, the hardware trigger operated in a 'pass-through' mode that accepted all bunch crossings, regardless of the inputs from the calorimeter and muon systems. The software trigger accepted all events with a minimum activity in the VELO. The integrated luminosity of the sample was determined in ref. [25], and is 1.06\u00b10.02 nb \u22121 (0.52\u00b10.01 nb \u22121 ) for the forward (backward) collisions, respectively. Due to the low beam intensity, multiple interactions in the bunch crossings are very rare, and only a single PV is reconstructed for each event.",

The prompt fraction is determined independently in two-dimensional (p T , y * ) bins and tends to decrease with increasing p T and y * , with an average value of \u223c 90% for both rapidity regions. The log 10 \u03c7 2 IP (\u039b + c ) distributions of \u039b + c candidates with 2 < p T < 10 GeV/c and in the full rapidity region, together with the fits, are displayed in figure 2 (a) and (b), for the forward and backward samples, respectively. The statistical uncertainty of the prompt fraction is considered to be partially correlated with the statistical uncertainty of the inclusive \u039b + c yield. The correlation factor in each (p T , y * ) bin is derived from a simultaneous two-dimensional fit to the m(pK \u2212 \u03c0 + )-log 10 \u03c7 2 IP (\u039b + c ) distribution. The total efficiency, \u03b5 tot , in eq. (3.1) is decomposed into three components: the geometrical acceptance, the reconstruction and selection efficiency, and the PID efficiency. The geometrical acceptance efficiency is the fraction of \u039b + c baryons within the LHCb geometrical acceptance, and is determined from simulation. For most bins this efficiency is above 90%. The reconstruction and selection efficiencies are calculated with simulated pPb events at \u221a s NN = 5 TeV. The simulated samples are validated by comparing the distributions of kinematic variables with those obtained from the data using the sPlot technique. The reconstruction efficiency is affected by the track multiplicity of the event, which is not well reproduced in the simulation. Following the method developed in ref. [10], the efficiency is evaluated as a function of track multiplicity and a correction factor is derived. to calculate the efficiencies is implemented [38] to take into account the effect of resonant structures in the \u039b + c decay, where the signal kinematics in the data are gained with the sPlot technique. The final reconstruction and selection efficiency in general increases with p T . The efficiency is below 1% for the lowest p T values and reaches 4-5% at p T > 8 GeV/c.",

The samples are taken from the same pPb data set as used in the present analysis. The single-track PID efficiencies are mostly above 80% (90%) for protons (pions and kaons) for track momenta in the range of 3 < p < 100 GeV/c and pseudorapidities in the range of 2 < \u03b7 < 5, although the efficiencies at the edge of the acceptance are generally lower.

The results are compared to the HELAC-Onia calculations [40][41][42], which are based on a data-driven modelling of parton scattering. The theory prediction is calculated with HELAC-Onia, where the \u039b + c production cross-section is parameterised by fitting the LHCb pp data [22]. The nuclear matter effects in pPb collisions are incorporated using the nPDFs EPS09LO/NLO [43], nCTEQ15 nPDFs [44]. The effects of the nPDFs tend to cancel in the ratio R \u039b + c /D 0 , leading to similar ratios between the different nPDFs. The calculations with the three nPDFs show comparable trends and values across p T and y * , with nCTEQ15 slightly lower than EPS09, suggesting small nPDF effects in the R \u039b + c /D 0 ratio.  Figure 6 shows the R \u039b + c /D 0 ratio as a function of p T in four different rapidity ranges. Numerical values can be found in table 7 in appendix C. The R \u039b + c /D 0 ratios are measured to be around 0.3. The values are larger at lower p T (< 5 GeV/c) and tend to decrease for p T greater than 5 GeV/c. The trend is less clear in the backward region due to larger uncertainties. The theoretical calculations are displayed as coloured curves. They increase slightly with increasing p T . In the backward region, the data points are consistent with the theoretical calculations. The forward data points are consistent with the calculations at lower p T (< 7 GeV/c). However, they are below the theoretical predictions for p T greater than 7 GeV/c. Figure 7 illustrates the R \u039b + c /D 0 ratio for 2 < p T < 10 GeV/c as a function of rapidity. The numerical values are given in appendix C. The theoretical calculations are made for the rapidity range \u22124.0 < y * < 4.0, and show a relatively uniform distribution.

The forward-backward production ratios R FB are presented, and are compared to theoretical predictions. A larger production rate in the backward-rapidity region compared to the forward region is observed. The forwardbackward production ratio R FB shows consistency with HELAC-Onia calculations with the three nPDFs EPS09LO, EPS09NLO [43] and nCTEQ15 [44]. In addition, the production cross-section ratio R \u039b + c /D 0 between \u039b + c baryons and D 0 mesons, which is sensitive to the hadronisation mechanism of the charm particles, is measured. The result is consistent with theory calculations based on pp data. The \u039b + c measurements in classes of event multiplicity can be anticipated with the pPb dataset at \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV recorded by the LHCb collaboration in 2016, which is about 20 times larger than the 5.02 TeV dataset. An improvement in precision is also achievable with the increased sample size and an improved simulation. In addition, a dataset of pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV corresponding to a luminosity of 0.1 fb \u22121 was collected in 2017. The nuclear modification factor for the \u039b + c baryons can be directly measured using this dataset.",

(c) the proper decay time of the \u039b + c candidate is in the range [0.1, 1.2] ps; (d) the p, K \u2212 and \u03c0 + candidates form a good-quality vertex;and (e) the decay vertex is significantly separated from the PV. After the selection, about 1% of the events are found to contain multiple candidates. All candidates are kept.
