The proton-proton collision data set analysed amounts to 36.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Top quark pair events are searched for, where one top quark decays into qH and the other decays into bW . Both the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the W boson are used. No significant excess is observed and an upper limit is set on the t \u2192 cH branching ratio of 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at the 95% confidence level, while the expected limit in the absence of signal is 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The corresponding limit on the tcH coupling is 0.090 at the 95% confidence level. The observed upper limit on the t \u2192 uH branching ratio is 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

This decay, which proceeds via a flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC), is forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM) and, with respect to the dominant top quark decay mode (t \u2192 bW ), is suppressed at higher orders due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism [4]. The t \u2192 qH branching ratio (B) in the SM is estimated to be around 3 \u00d7 10 \u221215 (see ref. [5] and references therein), and an observation of this decay would provide a clear signal of physics beyond the SM (BSM).",

As the t \u2192 cH and t \u2192 uH modes are hard to distinguish, the upper limits are given assuming that each final state is produced alone. In ATLAS, the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel [33] yields the observed and expected limits on B(t \u2192 cH) of 0.79% and 0.51% respectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL). Combining with the multi-lepton 1 and H \u2192 bb final states, which, at 8 TeV, are each comparable in sensitivity to the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel, the overall observed (expected) limit at the 95% CL is 0.46% (0.25%) for t \u2192 cH and 0.45% (0.29%) for t \u2192 uH [34]. The 95% CL observed (expected) limits from the CMS Collaboration on the t \u2192 cH and t \u2192 uH branching ratios are 0.40% (0.43%) and 0.55% (0.40%) respectively [35], using the same final states as ATLAS.",

The calorimeter isolation is computed as the sum of the transverse energy of positive-energy topological clusters 4 reconstructed in a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 around the photon candidate. The transverse energy of the photon candidate is subtracted from the sum. The contributions of underlying event and pile-up are subtracted based on the method suggested in ref. [62]. The track isolation is computed as the scalar sum of the transverse momentum p T of all tracks with p T > 1 GeV within a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 around the photon candidate. The tracks must satisfy some loose track quality criteria and originate from the interaction vertex (see below). For converted photon candidates, the tracks associated with the conversion are removed. For the \"loose\" isolation working point chosen in this analysis, the calorimeter (track) isolation is required to be less than 6.5% (5%) of the photon transverse energy. The efficiency of the calorimeter isolation requirement ranges from 83% to 97% for photons of E T between 25 GeV and 200 GeV which pass the identification requirements. The efficiency of the track isolation requirement ranges from 96% to 100% (93% to 97%) for unconverted (converted) photons of E T between 25 GeV and 200 GeV which pass the identification and calorimeter isolation requirements. A dedicated study using electrons and positrons from Z boson decays as a proxy for photons showed that the ratio of isolation efficiencies in data and simulation remains constant at 1.01 \u00b1 0.01 per event, for events with up to four reconstructed jets.",

The discrepancy is attributed to the large uncertainty affecting the theoretical cross sections of these processes and to the lack of W \u03b3 and Z\u03b3 events with an extra photon from ISR, FSR or jets faking photons, for which the size of the simulated samples was not large enough to have a meaningful estimate after the full selection. Applying a scaling factor of 3 to the W \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 contributions (as derived from the comparison of the tt\u03b3 and tt\u03b3\u03b3 samples), the fraction of simulated events with m T between 56 GeV and 88 GeV becomes 27 \u00b1 1%, thus compatible with the data. As explained in section 1, the disagreement as observed in figure 3(a) does not affect the result because in the final fit (see section 4) the background is determined from data only. A selection requiring m T larger than 30 GeV, which preserves a large fraction of the signal and rejects much of the background (especially from the S \u03b3\u03b3j sample), is applied.
