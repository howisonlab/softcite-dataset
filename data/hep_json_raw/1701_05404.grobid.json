The decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c7cJ and \u03c7cJ \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8 are observed for the first time. The measured branching fractions are B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c7cJ ) = (11.7 \u00b1 2.5 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , (8.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , (6.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22124 for J = 0, 1, 2, and B(\u03c7cJ \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8) = (1.51 \u00b1 0.30 \u00b1 0.13) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , (3.73 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , (2.48 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 are also reported. Also, the \u03b1 values of helicity angular distributions of the e + e \u2212 pair are determined for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c7c1,2 and \u03c7c1,2 \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8. Study of electromagnetic (EM) Dalitz decays [1], in which a virtual photon is internally converted into an e + e \u2212 pair, plays an important role in revealing the structure of hadrons and the interactions between photons and hadrons [2]. Such decays are widely observed in the light-quark meson sector, for example, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9e + e \u2212 , and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 [3]. However, the analogous transitions in charmonium decays have not yet been studied. Although the potential quark model has successfully described the low-lying charmonium states with high precisions, there are still puzzling discrepancies in the decay branching fractions B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ ) between the experimental results [3] where the higher-order multipole amplitudes are ignored and the various theoretical predictions [4][5][6][7]. Throughout this Letter, \u03c7 cJ refers to \u03c7 c0,1,2 . While recently the BESIII experiment confirms that the contributions from the higher-order multipole amplitudes in \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ are small [8], the E1 contribution is dominant. Therefore, it is of great interest to measure the EM transition \u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c7 cJ and \u03c7 cJ \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8.",

The q 2 -dependence of charmonium TFFs can provide additional information on the interactions between the charmonium states and the electromagnetic field, where q 2 is the square of the invariant mass of the e + e \u2212 pair, and serve as a sensitive probe to their internal structures. Furthermore, the q 2dependent TFF can possibly distinguish the transition mechanisms based on the cc scenario and other solutions which alter the simple quark model picture. We emphasize that the q 2 -dependent TFF can also serve as an useful probe for exotic hadron structures based on different models. One example is that with the precise measurement of the radiative decay of X(3872) \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8 and X(3872) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c8(3686) in the future, we can pin down the intrinsic structure of X(3872) by comparing the experimental measurement of the q 2 -dependence of TFF with different model calculations. The nature of X(3872), namely whether it is a compact charmonium, multiquark state with quark clustering, or hadronic molecule [9][10][11][12][13], can possibly be disentangled by the q 2dependence of its TFF.",

Here, the J/\u03c8 is reconstructed in its decay to an e + e \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair. The two cascade decays studied have the same final state: four leptons and a single photon. The analysis uses a data sample of 4.479 \u00d7 10 8 \u03c8(3686) events [14,15] taken at a center-ofmass energy \u221a s = 3.686 GeV collected with the BESIII detector [16] operating at the BEPCII [17] storage ring in 2009 and 2012. In addition, a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 44 pb \u22121 , taken at a centerof-mass energy \u221a s = 3.65 GeV [18], is used to estimate the background from continuum processes. The BESIII detector [16] has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of the total 4\u03c0 solid angle. A small-cell helium-based main drift chamber (MDC) provides momentum measurements of charged particles with resolution of 0.5% at 1 GeV/c. The MDC also supplies an energy loss (dE/dx) measurement with a resolution better than 6% for electrons from Bhabha scattering. The time-of-flight system (TOF) is composed of plastic scintillators with a time resolution of 80 (110) ps in the barrel (endcaps) and is used for charged particle identification. The CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) measures 1 GeV energy photons with a resolution of 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (endcaps) region.",

To suppress this background, a photon-conversion finder [23] is applied to reconstruct the photon-conversion vertex. The distance from the point of the reconstructed conversion vertex to the z axis, R xy , is used to distinguish the photon conversion background from signal. By studying the MC samples \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8, the peaks around R xy = 3 cm and R xy = 6 cm match the positions of the beam pipe and the inner wall of the MDC [16], respectively. We remove the events in 1.5 cm< R xy < 7.5 cm to suppress the \u03b3 conversion background. With this requirement, the \u03b3 conversion background is negligible for the decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c7 cJ and is at the few percent level for the decays \u03c7 cJ \u2192 e + e \u2212 J/\u03c8.",
