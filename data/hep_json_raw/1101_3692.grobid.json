The beauty events were identified using electrons from semileptonic b decays with a transverse momentum 0.9 < p e T < 8 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 e | < 1.5. Cross sections for beauty production were measured and compared with next-to-leadingorder QCD calculations. The beauty contribution to the proton structure function F 2 was extracted from the doubledifferential cross section as a function of Bjorken-x and Q 2 .",

They are compared to a leading-order (LO) plus parton-shower (PS) Monte Carlo prediction and to an NLO QCD calculation. The beauty contribution to the proton structure function F 2 , denoted as F bb 2 , was extracted from the double-differential cross section as a function of Q 2 and x and is compared with theoretical calculations.",

Tracking efficiency-the track-finding inefficiency in the data with respect to the MC was estimated to be at most 2%. The overall uncertainty due to this tracking in-efficiency was determined by randomly rejecting 2% of all tracks in the MC and repeating the secondary-vertex finding (\u22123.4%). 5. Decay-length smearing-the fraction of events in the MC where the decay-length smearing was applied was varied by \u00b12% and the additional terms for the smearing of the tails were switched off ( +2.6 \u22122.0 %); 6. p rel T shape correction-the correction applied to the MC was switched off and increased by an additional 50% ( \u22121.5 \u22122.4 %). 7. Electron background-the relative contributions of the different electron sources in the MC were changed by varying separately the contributions from photon conversions, Dalitz decays, semileptonic decays from charm and DIS electrons by \u00b125% ( +2.5 \u22122.4 %). 8. Charm-spectrum reweighting-the correction to the cdecay electron spectrum in the MC using the CLEO data was varied by \u00b150% ( +3.4 \u22122.9 %). 9. Energy scale-the global energy scale was varied in the MC by \u22132% ( +1.2 \u22121.0 %). 10. Jet energy scale-the calorimetric part of the transverse jet energy in MC was varied by \u00b13% ( +1.7 +0.7 %). 11. MC model dependence-the Q 2 reweighting correction was varied by a factor of two ( +2.0 \u22121.9 %). 12. Electron reconstruction efficiency-the electron reconstruction efficiency in MC was varied by \u00b10.05 in the FCAL and RCAL regions and by \u22130.05 in the BCAL region ( +4.0 \u22123.7 %). A series of further checks were made. The fit range was varied to check possible deficits in the background description. Selection cuts such as the Z vertex position or preselection cuts such as on the dE/dx test function were varied before repeating the analysis. Another important check was the charge dependence. Separate fits were made for electron and positron candidates for each lepton-beam charge separately as well as for the combined sample. All variations were found to be small and consistent with the expected fluctuations due to statistics and were therefore not included in the systematic error.",
