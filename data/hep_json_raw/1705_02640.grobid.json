The results are based on a data sample that contains 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. The measured inclusive branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry are (5.38 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10 \u22126 and \u22120.170 \u00b1 0.073 \u00b1 0.017, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The K + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution of the signal candidates shows an excess in the region below 1.5 GeV/c 2 , which is consistent with the previous studies from BaBar and LHCb. In addition, strong evidence of a large direct CP asymmetry is found in the low K + K \u2212 invariant-mass region.",

In contrast, the distributions for \u2206E and M bc are strongly correlated in the BB background samples, including generic B, rare combinatorial, rare peaking, and SCF components. Therefore, they are modelled with two-dimensional smoothed histograms from MC simulation. The free parameters in the fit are the signal yield, the signal A C P , the generic B yield, the rare peaking yields, and the continuum yield. The yields of rare combinatorial backgrounds are also derived from the MC study. The A C P of all backgrounds is fixed to zero in the fit. The stability and bias of the two-dimensional fit is checked by large ensemble tests using both toy and simulated MC events. The validity of the fit and branching fraction extraction method is checked using data in a high-statistics control sample of the B + \u2192D 0 (K + K \u2212 )\u03c0 + decays. The measured branching fraction for the control sample is consistent with the world-average value [16].",

The uncertainties due to the continuum suppression selection criteria and the signal PDF shape are estimated using a control sample of B + \u2192D 0 (K + K \u2212 )\u03c0 + decays. The potential fit bias is evaluated by performing an ensemble test comprising 1000 pseudoexperiments, where the signal component is taken from the signal MC sample, and the PDF shapes are used to generate the data for the other event categories. The observed 2.3% bias is included in the systematic uncertainty calculation. The uncertainty due to the continuum background PDF modeling is evaluated by varying the PDF parameters by \u00b11\u03c3 of their statistical errors. The uncertainty due to the data-MC difference is taken into account by using the fit model from the off-resonance data, which is included in the background PDF modeling in Table II. For the BB background PDFs that are modeled by a two-dimensional smoothed histogram PDFs, the associated uncertainty is evaluated by changing the bin sizes. The uncertainty due to the fixed yields of rare combinatorial backgrounds is also evaluated by varying each fixed yield up or down by its statistical error. The uncertainty due to non-zero A C P of rare peaking backgrounds is estimated by assuming the A C P values to be higher or lower than the LHCb measured values by 1\u03c3 of the LHCb measurement uncertainty [3]. In the absence of knowledge of the distribution of the SCF background in M K + K \u2212 , we use a conservative approach to evaluate the uncertainty by varying the fraction by \u00b150%; the resulting deviation from the nominal value is included in the fixed yields in Table II.",

A possible detector bias due to tracking acceptance and R K/\u03c0 is evaluated using the measured A C P value from the off-resonance data. We apply the same criteria as those for the signal except for the continuum-suppression requirement, and calculate A C P as in Eq. (1). The A C P value from off-resonance data is 0.0024 \u00b1 0.0014. The final A C P result can be either corrected with this detector bias, or it can be applied as a systematic uncertainty. For this result the central shift plus 1\u03c3 statistical error is included in the total systematic uncertainty for the A C P . A full list of systematic uncertainties in A C P is shown in Table II. In conclusion, we have reported the measured branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry for the suppressed decay B + \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + using the full \u03a5(4S) data sample collected with the Belle detector. We employ a twodimensional fit to determine the signal yield and A C P as a function of M K + K \u2212 . We confirm the excess and local A C P in the low M K + K \u2212 region reported by LHCb, and quantify the differential branching fraction in each K + K \u2212 invariant mass bin. We find a 4.8\u03c3 evidence for a negative CP asymmetry in the region M K + K \u2212 < 1.1 GeV/c 2 .
