The results from the analysis of 0.191 nb \u22121 of data obtained in June 2015 are compared to the predictions of several hadronic interaction models that are used in air-shower simulations for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

            "text": "Hadronic interaction models play an important role in ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observations. They are used in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of air-shower developments induced by UHECRs, which are one of the key tools used for reconstructing information about primary cosmic rays from observables measured by ground-based detectors. Currently, the Pierre Auger Observatory [1] and Telescope Array [2] are taking data for UHE-CRs. Although the experiments have published the results of the measured observables which are sensitive to the chemical composition of UHECRs, they have not yet reached any clear conclusions, because of the uncertainty related to the choice of hadronic interaction model [3][4][5]. Since it began operation in 2009, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest hadron collider, has provided unique opportunities for testing hadronic interaction models with collision energies exceeding 10 15 eV in a fixed target frame ( [6] for review of early results). The major models used in air-shower simulations for UHECRs were re-tuned and updated by taking into account several experimental results obtained from proton-proton collisions with center-of-momentum collision energies of 0.9 and 7 TeV. These models, QGSJET II-04 [7], EPOS-LHC [8], and SIBYLL 2.3 [9], are called the post-LHC models. However, even with these post-LHC models, inconsistencies between the observed data and MC simulations were reported [10].",

            "text": "The LHCf possesses two sampling and imaging calorimeter detectors which are installed on both sides of the LHC interaction point IP1 [14]. Each of the two detectors, Arm1 and Arm2, has two calorimeter towers with acceptances of 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm and 40 mm \u00d7 40 mm (Arm1), and 25 mm \u00d7 25 mm and 32 mm \u00d7 32 mm (Arm2). This double-calorimeter configuration allows the photon pairs to be detected from the decay of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons with threshold energies of 600 GeV and 2.2 TeV, respectively. Each calorimeter consists of 16 scintillator layers interleaved with 44 radiation lengths of tungsten plates. The detectors are located 140 m from IP1 and, in nominal operation, the smaller towers cover a pseudorapidity (\u03b7) range above 10, including the zero-degree collision angle. The larger towers are located above the smaller towers oriented 0 \u2022 (Arm1) and 45 \u2022 (Arm2) in the clockwise direction from the vertical. They cover the slightly off-center region where 8.5 < \u03b7 < 9.5. Before operation in 2015, the detectors were upgraded to improve their radiation hardness by replacing the plastic scintillators with Gd 2 SiO 5 (GSO) scintillators [15]. Four pairs of X-Y scintillating-fibre hodoscopes used in the Arm1 imaging sensor were also replaced with X-Y GSO bar-bundle hodoscopes [16]. In addition, four X-Y pairs of silicon detectors inserted in the Arm2 detector were upgraded to optimize the linearity. The performance of the upgraded detectors was studied in two beam tests at CERN-SPS before and after operation at the LHC.

            "text": "We combined the results using the same method as the analysis presented in Ref. [29]. This approach assumed that the systematic uncertainties of the energy scale, PID correction, performance of multi-hit identification, and beam position exhibited both bin-by-bin correlation and Arm1-Arm2 non-correlation. The other systematic uncertainties -luminosity, unfolding, and decay correction -were assumed to be fully correlated between Arm1 and Arm2. These uncertainties were added quadratically to the combined results. The upper panels of Fig. 4 show the combined cross-section with the predictions of the hadronic interaction models, QGSJET II-04, EPOS-LHC, DPMJET 3.06, SIBYLL 2.3, and PYTHIA 8.212. The shaded areas indicate the total statistical and systematic uncertainties, which were calculated using the combining method. The bottom panels show the ratio of MC predictions to the experimental results. In the pseudorapidity region \u03b7 > 10.94, the QGSJET II-04 and EPOS-LHC models show the best agreement overall with the data. PYTHIA 8.212 shows good agreement with the data from the lowest-energy bin to near the 3 TeV bin, although it clearly predicts a higher cross-section than the data in the energy region greater than 3 TeV. DPMJET 3.06 and SIBYLL 2.3 predict fluxes higher and lower, respectively, than the data in most of the energy range. In the pseudorapidity region 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99, results from the EPOS-LHC and PYTHIA 8.212 models show good agreements with the data except at the high-energy end above 3 TeV. QGSJET II-04 and DPMJET 3.06 predict fluxes lower and higher, respectively, than the data. SIBYLL 2.3 exhibits a different trend from the result in \u03b7 > 10.94, predicting a higher crosssection than the data in the energy range above > 1.5 TeV. This result is related to the fact that SIBYLL 2.3 predicts a larger mean value of p T for photons than both the data and other models.",

Except for DPM-JET 3.04, these models are older versions than those to which Fig. 4 refers. The updates to these models and differences in collision energy do not produce significant changes in the forward photon production cross-section in the QGSJET II and EPOS models. Thus, the detailed differences in the results from \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 13 TeV may correspond to the differences between the p T coverages.",

            "text": "The LHCf experiment measured the production cross-section of forward photons at \u03b7 > 10.94 and 8.99 > \u03b7 > 8.81 (Table 2) with proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The two LHCf detectors, Arm1 and Arm2, produced consistent results, which were combined while considering their statistical and systematic uncertainties. The final results were compared to the MC predictions obtained from several hadronic interaction models: QGSJET II-04, EPOS-LHC, DPMJET 3.06. SIBYLL 2.3, and PYTHIA 8.212. Among these models, EPOS-LHC showed the best agreement with the experimental data. QGSJET II-04 showed good agreement with the data for \u03b7 > 10.94 but predicted a lower flux than the data for 8.99 > \u03b7 > 8.81. PYTHIA 8.212 showed a higher cross-section than the data in the energy region above 3 TeV. No MC models matched the experimental data perfectly. The differences between the data and MC models were attributable to a less-than-complete understanding of the soft hadronic interaction processes. Common operations of the LHCf with the ATLAS experiment, in which the detector covers the central region of IP1, were performed in 2015. Detailed studies with event-by-event information measured by ATLAS will help us better understand the production of photons in the forward region [30].",
