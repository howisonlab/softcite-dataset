            "text": "One of the simplest weak neutral current interaction is the elastic scattering of a neutrino from a nucleon (NCE). This process is sensitive to both isoscalar and isovector weak currents carried by the nucleon whereas charge current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering is sensitive to only the isovector current. Both NCE and CCQE neutrino interactions are important for accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments, and to date, very few measurements in the GeV regime have been made, particularly with antineutrinos [1]. With regards to the definition of an NCE interaction, it should be noted that in the antineutrino-nucleon NCE scattering reported here, the antineutrino scatters off of both free and bound nucleons as we report in Appendix A.",

The enhancement is likely to arise from nucleon-nucleon correlations absent in the RFG model and NCE scattering provides a complementary channel to further examine the nuclear effects common to both CCQE and NCE neutrino-nucleon scattering. Electronnucleus scattering can also provide clues to understand neutrino-nucleus scattering and have been studied recently [4][5][6].",

Recently, a measurement of the neutrino content of the antineutrino mode flux was carried out [8] and an antineutrino CCQE (\u03bdCCQE) cross section measurement published [9]. Sizable nuclear effects are observed in both the \u03bdCCQE and\u03bdCCQE data suggesting contributions from nucleon-nucleon correlations and two-body exchange currents [10][11][12][13][14][15]. The \u03bdNCE cross section has been studied to quantify these nuclear effects [16][17][18][19]. As the RFG model does not incorporate the nuclear effects, agreement between the measured cross sections (\u03bdCCQE, \u03bdNCE, and\u03bdCCQE) and the cross section model was achieved by assigning a higher value (\u223c30%) to the axial mass (M A ) parameter in the axial-vector from factor.

In addition, the experiment is well suited to measure a variety of high-statistic, neutrino cross sections [2,7,[20][21][22]. It is situated in the Booster Neutrino Beamline (BNB) that produces the neutrino beam via the decay of mesons produced in a proton-beryllium interaction. The primary proton beam with a momentum of 8.89 GeV/c is extracted from the Fermilab Booster in 1.6 \u00b5s pulses with \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 12 protons in each beam pulse. They impinge on a beryllium target placed in a magnetic focusing horn. The p-Be interactions produce a secondary beam of mesons that can be selectively focused or defocused by the magnetic horn. In antineutrino mode, the magnetic horn focuses negatively charged particles and defocuses positively charged particles. The mesons then decay in an air-filled decay pipe producing a beam of (anti)neutrinos. Magnetic horn focusing also increases the desired neutrino flux reaching the MiniBooNE detector by a factor of \u223c 6. The average energy of the antineutrino beam is about 650 MeV. Further details on the BNB can be found in Ref. [28].",

The mineral oil [29] serves both as a target for the neutrino beam and the medium in which the resultant particles from neutrino interactions propagate . The detector is divided into two optically isolated regions separated by a spherical shell of radius 575 cm. The inner sphere, referred to as the signal region is lined with 1,280 inward-pointing 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) [30]. The outer shell is the veto region with 240 PMTs arranged in back-to-back pairs pointed along the circumference of the detector. Charged particles produced in the neutrino interaction emit Cherenkov and scintillation light that is collected by the PMTs. Six steel legs support the detector, situated in a vault along with the detector electronics and data acquisition (DAQ) systems. The entire assembly is buried under approximately 3 m of earth overburden to reduce cosmic ray backgrounds. Further details about the MiniBooNE detector can be found in Ref. [31].",

The resulting neutrino flux prediction for antineutrino mode running is shown in Fig. 1 (The flux tables are available at [34]). The neutrino contamination in the antineutrino mode beam is higher (\u223c16%) as compared to the corresponding antineutrino contamination of the neutrino mode beam (\u223c6%). For details on the MiniBooNE flux prediction in both modes see Ref. [28]. The neutrino contamination in the antineutrino mode beam was measured by the MiniBooNE collaboration [8] and the results applied to the flux estimate used in the present measurement. Neutrino interaction rates, products, and their kinematics in the MiniBooNE detector are predicted using the NUANCE [35] neutrino event generator that has been customized to the MiniBooNE experiment. It has as input the neutrino flux prediction described above, as well as the detector target material and geometry. The mineral oil target is CH 2 with a density of 0.845 g/cm 3 . The (anti)neutrino NCE scattering off of free protons is modeled using the Llewellyn-Smith formalism [36], while for bound nucleons the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model of Smith and Moniz [3] is used. In NUANCE pion production is assumed to occur via delta production as per Rein and Sehgal's prescription [37].",

In the low Q 2 regime, the Pauli blocking parameter was scaled up by a scaling factor, \u03ba=1.022, in order to match the observed MiniBooNE \u03bdCCQE data -see Ref. [39] for de-tails. Note that these values are used for the CCQE/NCE channels that are background to this measurement and the changes as indicated in more recent analyses [2,7] are covered by systematic errors on these parameters. In the case of neutrino induced resonant pion production, the form factors are assumed to be identical to those used in NCE and CCQE interaction, with the exception of the axial vector mass, where we take M A =1.1 GeV-see Ref. [21]. A 20% probability is assigned to the possibility that the outgoing pion is absorbed within the nucleus through final state interactions (FSI). In this case the final product of the interaction is just the nucleon, similar to a neutrino NCE interaction. Lastly, the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial vector form factor is taken to be zero with an uncertainty of 0.1.",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, the neutrino contamination in the antineutrino flux (\u223c16%) is significantly larger than the corresponding antineutrino contamination in neutrino mode (\u223c4%). HARP [33] did not cover all the phase space for \u03c0 + production necessary to specify the neutrino background in the antineutrino beam. The neutrino contamination in the antineutrino mode beam was measured by MiniBooNE to constrain the flux outside of the region where data from the HARP experiment are available. Three independent and complimentary techniques are employed to measure the neutrino background utilizing the high-statistic neutrino mode cross section measurements made in an almost pure neutrino beam. Briefly, the first technique exploits the difference in the angular distribution of outgoing muons in\u03bd and \u03bd CCQE interactions to tag neutrino induced events. The second technique inferred the rate of \u03bd induced events from a study of the charged current (CC) single pion production channel. The neutrino CC single pion interaction leads to a \u03c0 + whose decay into a muon is seen in the detector, however the corresponding antineutrino CC single pion interaction produces a \u03c0 \u2212 that is absorbed in the detector medium most of the time [45]. The third technique to constrain the \u03bd component of the beam exploits an external measurement of the rate of \u00b5 \u2212 nuclear capture in \u03bd CC interactions [46]. The results from the three techniques are consistent. For details on the first two techniques see Ref. [8] and for the third technique see Appendix A in Ref. [9]. Accordingly, a correction factor of 0.78 was applied to the MC prediction of the original neutrino flux (in the antineutrino mode) based on the HARP measurement. The antineutrino flux prediction was unchanged in this procedure. The cross section of neutrino induced NCE events in the antineutrino mode is inferred from the high-statistic neutrino mode \u03bdNCE cross section measurement [7]. The total uncertainty in the estimation of the \u03bdNCE background events in the sample is 14%. The next major background are neutrino/antineutrino interactions occurring in the earth surrounding the detector resulting in nucleons (mostly neutrons) which penetrate the detector without firing veto PMTs. The so called dirt events are a significant fraction of the total background, particularly at low (below 300 MeV) energies. They are difficult to model as they result from interactions with various media outside the detector (the soil, detector support structures etc.), whose exact com- position is not known. However, they have distinct kinematics and spatial distributions that can be used to constrain their contribution. Dirt events are mostly low in energy, preferentially reconstructed in the upstream part (the side facing the beam), and close to the edge of the detector. We use this kinematic information to select a sample of \"dirt-enriched\" events in both data and MC. A chi-square minimization is then employed to fit the MC prediction with a single scale factor to the observed data. The resulting fits show agreement across the three variables which were chosen: the reconstructed Z variable (axis along the beam direction), reconstructed R variable (radius) and reconstructed energy. Figure 6 shows a representative energy bin in a sample enriched in \"dirt events\" produced with the reconstructed Z variable. For details on the dirt measurement method used in Mini-BooNE NCE analyses see Appendix A in Ref. [7]. This background was separately measured in this\u03bdNCE analysis and \u03bdNCE analysis [7], as the dirt background composition could be different in the two cases. The resultant dirt scaling factor of 0.62 was applied to the MC dirt prediction with an uncertainty of 10%. This may be compared to the scaling factor of 0.68 for the neutrino mode [7]. The final background is the\u03bdNCE-like events which are NC-pion events where the pion is absorbed within the nucleus, resulting in a final state identical to a\u03bdNCE scattering signal event. We rely on the MC prediction (together with the MiniBooNE measured neutral current \u03c0 0 cross section [47]) to estimate this background. The NUANCE cross section model assigns an error of 30% for pion absorption. Note that the\u03bdNCE-like background is the only background not directly measured in this analysis, hence we report the calculated contribution which was subtracted to obtain our final antineutrino-nucleon NCE scattering cross section measurement (Fig. 7). Ta-  We report the\u03bdNCE scattering differential cross section as a function of the measured quasi-elastic momentum transfer (Q 2 QE(N ) ) from the total kinetic energy of scattered nucleons. This is to be distinguished from the true neutrino-nucleon four-momentum transferred (Q 2 ), a model-dependent quantity. This Q 2 QE(N ) is a welldefined experimental variable and was used for the \u03bdNCE measurement [7]. It corresponds to the true Q 2 in the simple case of a static target nucleon (no Fermi motion) and no FSI.",

However, it should be noted that Q 2 QE(N ) is sensitive to the neutrino flux and the two measurements are made in the same beamline but with opposite horn polarities, resulting in non-identical flux spectra.

The MiniBooNE target is mineral oil (CH 2 ), hence the scattering is off of both bound nucleons (in carbon) and free nucleons (in hydrogen). In fact, the cross section is a sum of three different processes: the antineutrino scattering off free protons in the hydrogen atom, the bound protons in the carbon atom and, the bound neutrons in the carbon atom.
