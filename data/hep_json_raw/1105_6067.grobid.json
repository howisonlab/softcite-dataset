Conversion decays offer the possibility to precisely measure the virtual photon 4-momentum via the invariant mass of the e + e \u2212 pair. The lack of hadrons among the decay products makes the matrix element directly sensitive to the \u03b7 meson transition form factor [1]. The knowledge of the \u03b7 meson coupling to virtual photons is important for the calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, being pseudoscalar exchange the major contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering.",

In Table 1, number of events in data, N(data), MC signal efficiencies, \u03b5(sig), and background rejection factor R, defined as the ratio of analysis efficiency between signal and background, are also reported. The R value has been evaluated for three different categories: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 with \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 (R \u03b7\u2192e + e \u2212 \u03b3 ), \u03c6 \u2192 KK and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 (R \u03c6\u2192KK /\u03c1\u03c0 ) and all other \u03c6 decays products (R others ). After all cuts, background from kaons and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events is negligible. The same holds for all other \u03c6 decays but \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 which, as will be shown in the next section, results in \u223c 15% contamination level. Systematics on the Monte Carlo description of photon conversion have been studied using events with similar characteristics. A clean control sample is provided by the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 , \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay chain, where simple analysis cuts provide a good data-MC agreement, with negligible background contamination. As for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 channel, before dedicated analysis cuts the control sample is significantly contaminated by background from photon conversion (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 with photon converting on beam pipe or drift chamber walls). This background is completely removed rejecting events with D ee (DCW) < 10 cm and M ee (DCW) < 80 MeV. For the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 channel this cut has not been applied because, having two electrons and two positrons in the final state, the search for a conversion has to be performed over all the four e + e \u2212 combinations, thus spreading the signal contribution in the M ee (DCW)-D ee (DCW) plane and lowering significantly the analysis efficiency. Removing the cuts on M ee -D ee planes in the control sample, a clear background contamination from photon conversion is visible. Data-MC comparison shows that, increasing in the simulation the probability of conversion by 10%, an excellent agreement is found. A 10% systematic error is then assigned to photon conversion and added to the uncertainties coming from MC statistics and BR(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 ) measurement [3]: N(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 ) = 80 \u00b1 3 MC \u00b1 8 BR \u00b1 8 syst .",

The resulting \u03c7 2 /ndf is 43.9/34,   (1) where N \u03b7\u2192e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 (\u03b3 ) is the number of signal events and \u03b7\u2192e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 (\u03b3 ) is the efficiency taken from MC. The number of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 events, N \u03b7\u03b3 , has been obtained using the formula N \u03b7\u03b3 = L \u2022 \u03c3 \u03c6\u2192\u03b7\u03b3 , where L is the integrated luminosity and the cross section \u03c3 \u03c6\u2192\u03b7\u03b3 has been evaluated taking into account the \u03c6 meson line shape on a run by run basis [16]. Inserting all the numbers quoted in Table 2, the value: BR \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 (\u03b3 ) = (2.44 \u00b1 0.19 stat+bckg ) \u00d7 10 \u22125",
