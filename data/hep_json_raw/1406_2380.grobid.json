            "text": "We present the observation of doubly-produced J/\u03c8 mesons with the D0 detector at Fermilab in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The production cross section for both singly and doubly-produced J/\u03c8 mesons is measured using a sample with an integrated luminosity of 8.1 fb \u22121 . For the first time, the double J/\u03c8 production cross section is separated into contributions due to single and double parton scatterings. Using these measurements, we determine the effective cross section \u03c3 eff , a parameter characterizing an effective spatial area of the parton-parton interactions and related to the parton spatial density inside the nucleon. Heavy quarkonium is a well established probe of both quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and possible new bound states of hadronic matter, e.g., tetraquarks [1,2]. Production of multiple quarkonium states provides insight into the parton structure of the nucleon and partonto-hadron fragmentation effects. In pp collisions, there are three main production mechanisms for J/\u03c8 mesons: prompt production (i.e. directly at the interaction point) of J/\u03c8, and prompt production of heavier charmonium states, such as the 3 P 1 state \u03c7 1c and the 3 P 2 state \u03c7 2c that decay to J/\u03c8 + \u03b3, or decay to J/\u03c8 + X of directly produced \u03c8(2S), and non-prompt B hadron decays. The first observation of J/\u03c8 meson pair production was made in 1982 by the NA3 Collaboration [3,4]. The LHCb Collaboration has measured the double J/\u03c8 production cross section in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [5]. At",

A number of discussions of early experimental results [7,8] and more recent LHCb results [6,9], show that the fraction of DP events at the Tevatron and especially at the LHC can be quite substantial. Since the initial state is dominated by gg scattering, the fraction of DP scatterings representing simultaneous, independent parton interactions, should significantly depend on the spatial distribution of gluons in a proton [10]. Other DP studies involving vector bosons and jets probe the spatial distributions in processes with quark-quark or quark-gluon initial states [11][12][13][14][15][16]. The measurement of the SP production cross section provides unique information to constrain parametrizations of the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) at low parton momentum fraction and energy scale, where the gluon PDF has large uncertainty [17]. The production of J/\u03c8 mesons may proceed via two modes, color singlet and color octet [1,8,18,20]. Predictions carried out using nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) show that the color singlet process in SP scattering contributes \u2248 90% for the region of transverse momenta, p J/\u03c8 T \u2265 4 GeV/c, relevant for this measurement [8,18].",

The muon candidates must satisfy timing requirements to suppress cosmic rays. Their distance of closest approach to the beam line has to be less than 0.5 cm and their matching tracks have to pass within 2 cm along the beam (z) axis of the event interaction vertex. The pp interaction vertex should be within 60 cm of the center of the detector along beam axis.

Events having two such pairs of muons are identified as DJ candidates.

We use the fitted parameters to estimate the background in the signal window 2.85 < M \u00b5\u00b5 < 3.35 GeV for both J/\u03c8 meson candidates and compute the fraction of the accidental+J2\u00b5 background events to be f acc,J2\u00b5 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.05. To estimate the fraction of the prompt double J/\u03c8 events, we use a template fit to the 2D c\u03c4 distribution in DJ data. The c\u03c4 template for double prompt mesons is obtained from the signal MC sample. The double nonprompt template is created from the bb MC sample, in which B hadron decays produce two J/\u03c8 mesons. We also create a prompt+non-prompt template by randomly choosing c\u03c4 values from the prompt and non-prompt templates. Before fitting, the accidental and J2\u00b5 background is subtracted from the data according to its fraction (f acc,J2\u00b5 ) with the uncertainty propagated into an uncertaity on the prompt fraction. The 2D c\u03c4 template for this backgound is built using data outside the signal mass window. The prompt fraction of DJ events in our selection is found to be f prompt = 0.592 \u00b1 0.101, while the non-prompt and prompt+non-prompt events contribute 0.373 \u00b1 0.073 and 0.035 \u00b1 0.073, respectively. The main source of systematic uncertainty for the prompt fraction is the template fitting, and the uncertainty related with the subtraction of the accidental background from the data.",

To discriminate between the two mechanisms, we exploit the distribution of the pseudorapidity difference between the two J/\u03c8 candidates, |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| which is stable against radiation and instrinsic parton p T effects [6,9]. For the two J/\u03c8 mesons produced from two almost uncorrelated parton scatterings with smaller (on average) parton momentum fractions than in the SP scattering, the |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| distribution is expected to be broader. We use the DP and SP templates produced by MC to obtain the DP and SP fractions from a maximum likelihood fit to the |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| distribution in DJ data. Contributions from the accidental background, non-prompt and prompt+non-prompt double J/\u03c8 events are subtracted from data. The fit result is shown in Fig. 4. In the region |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| 2, the data are dominated by DP events, as predicted in Ref. [6]. A possible contribution from pseudo-diffractive gluon-gluon scattering should give a negligible contribution [6]. To estimate the systematic uncertainties of the DP and SP fractions, we vary the subtraction of accidental, nonprompt and prompt+non-prompt backgrounds within their uncertainties. To conservatively estimate systematic uncertainty related to the prompt+non-prompt background, it is assumed to be either 100% SP-or DP-like. We also create a data-like DP template combining two J/\u03c8 meson candidates from two events randomly selected from the single J/\u03c8 data sample, emulat-ing two independent scatterings each with a single J/\u03c8 final state. This template is corrected for the accidental and non-prompt backgrounds in data. We extract the DP and SP fractions from the fit to the DJ data sample. We find the fractions to be f DP = 0.42 \u00b1 0.12 and f SP = 0.58 \u00b1 0.12. These results are averaged over those obtained with the two SP (herwig++ and DJpsiFDC) and two DP (pythia and data-like) models. The main sources of the uncertainties on DP (SP) fractions are the background subtraction, 18.4% (13.4%), the model dependence, 19.3% (14%), and the template fit, 7.1% (6.3%). The uncertainty due to the model dependence is estimated by varying the DP and SP models, and mainly caused by the difference between the two DP models. Variation of the gluon PDF [17] results in a small change of the DP and SP |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| templates and introduces a negligible uncertainty on the DP fraction. We verify that we do not introduce a bias by determining the prompt, SP, and DP fractions in data by doing two successive fits of the c\u03c4 and |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| distributions. For this purpose, we perform a simultaneous 2D fit for the non-prompt, SP, and DP fractions using templates as functions of inclusive c\u03c4 and |\u2206\u03b7(J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8)| to the data corrected for the accidental and prompt+nonprompt backgrounds. The fractions of prompt DP and SP events determined by this procedure are in agreement within uncertainties with the central result obtained by the two successive fits.

The main sources of systematic uncertainty in the \u03c3 eff measurement are trigger efficiency and the fraction of DP events. By substituting the measured single J/\u03c8 and double J/\u03c8 DP cross sections (Eqs. 2 and 7) into Eq. 1, we obtain \u03c3 eff = 4.8 \u00b1 0.5(stat) \u00b1 2.5(syst) mb. (13) In conclusion, we have observed double J/\u03c8 production at the Tevatron and measured its cross section. We show that this production is caused by single and double parton scatterings. The measured SP cross section may indicate a need for a higher gluon PDF at small parton momenta and small energy scale, and higher order corrections to the theoretical predictions. The measured \u03c3 eff agrees with the result reported by the AFS Collaboration (\u2248 5 mb [39]), and is in agreement with the \u03c3 eff obtained by CDF [12] in the 4-jet final state (12.1 +10.7 \u22125.4 mb). However, it is lower than the result obtained by CDF [13] (14.5 \u00b1 1.7(stat) +1.7 \u22122.3 (syst)) and the D0 [14] result (12.7 \u00b1 0.2(stat) \u00b1 1.3(syst)) in \u03b3 + 3-jet events, and by ATLAS [15] (15 \u00b1 3(stat) +5 \u22123 (syst)) and by CMS [16] (20.7 \u00b1 0.8(stat) \u00b1 6.6(syst)) in the W +2-jet final state. We note that initial state in the DP double J/\u03c8 production is very similar to 4-jet production at low p T which is dominated by gluons, while \u03b3(W )+jets events are produced in quark interactions, qq, qg, and qq \u2032 . The measured \u03c3 eff may indicate a smaller average distance between gluons than between quarks or between a quark and a gluon, in the transverse space. This result is in a qualitative agreement with the pion cloud model predicting a smaller nucleon's average gluonic transverse size than that for singlet quarks [40].",
