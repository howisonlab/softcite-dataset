            "text": "A search for flavour-changing neutral current decays of a top quark to an uptype quark (q = u, c) and the Standard Model Higgs boson, where the Higgs boson decays to bb, is presented. The analysis searches for top quark pair events in which one top quark decays to W b, with the W boson decaying leptonically, and the other top quark decays to Hq. The search is based on pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and uses an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon and at least four jets. The search exploits the high multiplicity of bquark jets characteristic of signal events, and employs a likelihood discriminant that uses the kinematic differences between the signal and the background, which is dominated by tt \u2192 W bW b decays. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits of 0.56% (0.42%) and 0.61% (0.64%) are derived for the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios respectively. The combination of this search with other ATLAS searches in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 decay modes significantly improves the sensitivity, yielding observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits on the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios of 0.46% (0.25%) and 0.45% (0.29%) respectively. The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the |\u03bb tcH | and |\u03bb tuH | couplings are 0.13 (0.10) and 0.13 (0.10) respectively. These are the most restrictive direct bounds on tqH interactions measured so far.",

            "text": "Following the observation of a Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2], a comprehensive programme of measurements of its properties is underway looking for deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. An interesting possibility is the presence of flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions between the Higgs boson, the top quark, and a u-or c-quark, tqH (q = u, c). Since the Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark, with a measured mass m H = 125.09 \u00b1 0.24 GeV [3], such interactions would manifest themselves as FCNC top quark decays, t \u2192 Hq. In the SM, such decays are extremely suppressed relative to the dominant t \u2192 W b decay mode, since tqH interactions are forbidden at the tree level and even suppressed at higher-orders in the perturbative expansion due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [4]. As a result, the SM predictions for the t \u2192 Hq branching ratios are exceedingly small: BR(t \u2192 Hu) \u223c 10 \u221217 and BR(t \u2192 Hc) \u223c 10 \u221215 [5][6][7][8]. On the other hand, large enhancements in these branching ratios are possible in some beyond-SM scenarios, where the GIM suppression can be relaxed and/or new particles can contribute to the loops, yielding effective couplings orders of magnitude larger than those of the SM. Examples include quark-singlet models [9], two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) of type I, with explicit flavour conservation, and of type II, such as the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [10][11][12], or supersymmetric models with R-parity violation [13]. In those scenarios, typical branching ratios can be as high as BR(t \u2192 Hq) \u223c 10 \u22125 . An even larger branching ratio of BR(t \u2192 Hc) \u223c 10 \u22123 can be reached in 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation (type III), since a tree-level FCNC coupling is not forbidden by any symmetry [14][15][16]. While other FCNC top couplings, tq\u03b3, tqZ, tqg, are also enhanced relative to the SM prediction in those scenarios beyond the SM, the largest enhancements are typically for the tqH couplings, and in particular the tcH coupling. See ref. [7] for a review. Searches for t \u2192 Hq decays have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, taking advantage of the large samples of tt events collected during Run 1 of the LHC. In these searches, one of the top quarks is required to decay into W b, while the other top quark decays into Hq, yielding tt \u2192 W bHq. 1 Assuming SM decays for the Higgs boson and m H = 125 GeV, the most sensitive single-channel searches have been performed in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode which, despite the tiny branching ratio of BR(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) 0.2%, is characterised by very small background and excellent diphoton mass resolution. The resulting observed (expected) 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on BR(t \u2192 Hq) are 0.79% (0.51%) and 0.69% (0.81%), respectively from the ATLAS [17] and CMS [18] collaborations. These searches are insensitive to the difference between t \u2192 Hu and t \u2192 Hc, and thus the above limits can be interpreted as applying to the sum BR(t \u2192 Hu)+BR(t \u2192 Hc). The CMS Collaboration has also reinterpreted searches in multilepton (three or four leptons) final states [18] in the context of tt \u2192 W bHq with H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 , resulting in an observed (expected) upper limit of BR(t \u2192 Hc) < 1.28% (1.17%) at the 95% CL. Multilepton searches are able to exploit a significantly larger branching ratio for the Higgs boson JHEP12(2015)061 decay compared to the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode, and are also characterised by relatively small backgrounds. However, in general they do not have good mass resolution, 2 so any excess would be hard to interpret as originating from t \u2192 Hq decays. The combination of CMS searches in diphoton and multilepton (three or four leptons) final states yields an observed (expected) upper limit of BR(t \u2192 Hc) < 0.56% (0.65%) at the 95% CL [18].",

This search is focused on the tt \u2192 W bHq (q = u, c) process, with W \u2192 \u03bd ( = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ) and H \u2192 bb, resulting in a lepton-plus-jets final state with high b-jet multiplicity, which can be effectively exploited to suppress the overwhelming tt background. Early studies of the prospects for this search at the LHC were performed in ref. [20]. Only events with an electron or muon, including those produced via leptonically decaying taus, are considered. The lepton-plus-jets final state also allows the kinematic reconstruction of the final state and in particular the dijet invariant mass spectrum from the H \u2192 bb decay, providing additional handles that would help in detecting tt \u2192 W bHq events. Most of this paper is devoted to the discussion of this particular search, for which background estimation techniques, systematic uncertainties and statistical treatment closely follow those used in recent ATLAS searches using the same final-state signature [21,22]. This paper also includes a reinterpretation of the ATLAS search for ttH associated production, with H \u2192 W W * , ZZ * , \u03c4 \u03c4 , resulting in multilepton final states [23]. This reinterpretation only considers the final states with a significant expected contribution from tt \u2192 W bHq, H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 signal, namely two same-charge leptons with and without an identified hadronic tau lepton and three leptons. A combination of the three ATLAS searches for tt \u2192 W bHq, probing the H \u2192 bb, H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 , and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay modes, is performed and bounds are set on BR(t \u2192 Hc) and BR(t \u2192 Hu), as well as on the corresponding non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings.",

The inner detector provides tracking information from silicon pixel and microstrip detectors in the pseudorapidity 3 range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and from a straw-tube transition radiation tracker covering |\u03b7| < 2.0, all immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. The electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeter uses lead as the absorber material and liquid-argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. Hadron calorimetry is also based on the sampling technique, with either scintillator tiles or LAr as the active medium, and with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. The calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 4.9. The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muons with |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers located in a toroidal field of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T in the central and end-cap regions of ATLAS, respectively. The muon spectrometer is also instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. A three-level trigger system [25] is used to select interesting events. The first-level trigger is implemented in custom electronics and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels exploiting the full detector information and yielding a typical recorded event rate of 400 Hz during 2012.",

Prior to jet finding, a local cluster calibration scheme [34] is applied to correct the topological cluster energies for the non-compensating response of the calorimeter, as well as for the energy lost in dead material and via out-of-cluster leakage. The corrections are obtained from simulations of charged and neutral particles. After energy calibration [35], jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To reduce the contamination due to jets originating from pileup interactions, a requirement on the absolute value of the jet vertex fraction (JVF) variable above 0.5 is applied to jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. This requirement ensures that at least 50% of the scalar sum of the p T of the tracks with p T > 1 GeV associated with a jet comes from tracks originating from the primary vertex. During jet reconstruction, no distinction is made between identified electrons and jet energy deposits. Therefore, if any of the jets lie within \u2206R = 0.2 of a selected electron, the closest jet is discarded in order to avoid double-counting of electrons as jets. Finally, any electron or muon within \u2206R = 0.4 of a selected jet is discarded.",

An alternative sample, used to study the uncertainty related to the hadronisation model, is interfaced to Herwig v6.520 [47] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and Jimmy v4.31 [48] to simulate the UE. All samples are generated assuming a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV and top quark decays exclusively through t \u2192 W b. The tt process is normalised to a cross section of 253 +15 \u221216 pb, computed using Top++ v2.0 [49] at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [50][51][52][53][54], and using the MSTW 2008 NNLO [55,56] PDF set. Theoretical uncertainties result from variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as from uncertainties on the PDF and \u03b1 S . The latter two represent the largest contribution to the overall theoretical uncertainty on the cross section and were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [57] with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO [44,58] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [59] PDF sets. In the case where a non-zero BR(t \u2192 Hq) is assumed, an additional factor of [1 \u2212 BR(t \u2192 Hq)] 2 is applied to the sample normalisation. It is not possible to generate the tt \u2192 W bHq signal with Powheg-Box, and a different event generator is used instead, as discussed below.",

The first two categories are generically referred to as tt+HF events (with HF standing for \"heavy flavour\"), while the latter category also includes events with no additional jets.

This correction significantly improves agreement between simulation and data at \u221a s = 8 TeV in distributions such as the jet multiplicity and the p T of decay products of the tt system [21], and is applied only to tt+light-jets and tt + cc events. The modelling of the tt + bb background is improved by reweighting the Powheg-Box+Pythia prediction to an NLO prediction of tt + bb with massive b quarks and including parton showering [62], based on Sherpa+OpenLoops [63,64] using the CT10 PDF set.

To avoid double-counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower, a parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [72] is employed. The W +jets samples are generated separately for W +lightjets, W bb+jets, W cc+jets, and W c+jets. The Z+jets samples are generated separately for Z+light-jets, Zbb+jets, and Zcc+jets. Overlap between V QQ+jets (V = W, Z and Q = b, c) events generated from the matrix-element calculation and those generated from parton-shower evolution in the W/Z+light-jets samples is avoided via an algorithm based on the angular separation between the extra heavy quarks: if \u2206R(Q,Q) > 0.4, the matrixelement prediction is used, otherwise the parton-shower prediction is used. Both the W +jets and Z+jets background contributions are normalised to their inclusive NNLO theoretical cross sections [73]. Further corrections are applied to W/Z+jets events in order to better describe data in the preselected sample. Normalisation factors for each of the W +jets categories (W bb+jets, W cc+jets, W c+jets and W +light-jets) are derived for events with one lepton and at least four jets by simultaneously analysing six different event categories, defined by the b-tag multiplicity (0, 1 and \u22652) and the sign of the lepton charge [74]. The b-tag multiplicity provides information about the heavy-flavour composition of the W +jets background, while the lepton charge is used to determine the normalisation of each component, exploiting the expected charge asymmetry for W +jets production in pp collisions as predicted by Alpgen. In the case of Z+jets events, a correction to the heavy-flavour fraction is derived to reproduce the relative rates of Z+2-jets events with zero and one b-tagged jet observed in data. In addition, the Z boson p T spectrum is compared between data and the simulation in Z+2-jets events, and a reweighting function is derived in order to improve the modelling. This reweighting function is also applied to the W +jets simulated sample and it was verified that this correction further improves the agreement between data and simulation for W +jets events. In any case, W/Z+jets events constitute a very small background in this analysis after final event selection.",

In the muon channel, the multijet background is predominantly from non-prompt muons. Its normalisation and shape are estimated directly from data by using the \"matrix method\" technique [39], which exploits differences in leptonidentification-related properties between prompt and isolated leptons and leptons that are either non-isolated or result from the misidentification of photons or jets.

Two separate samples are generated corresponding to tt \u2192 W bHc and tt \u2192 W bHu, with the W boson forced to decay leptonically, W \u2192 \u03bd ( = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ), The top quark and Higgs boson masses are set to 172.5 GeV and 125 GeV, respectively. The Higgs boson is allowed to decay to all SM particles with branching ratios as given in ref. [89]. The signal sample is normalised to the same NNLO cross section as used for the tt \u2192 W bW b sample, and the corresponding branching ratios: \u03c3(tt \u2192 W (\u2192 \u03bd)bHq) = 2BR(t \u2192 Hq)[1 \u2212 BR(t \u2192 Hq)]BR(W \u2192 \u03bd)\u03c3 tt , with BR(W \u2192 \u03bd) = 0.324 and BR(t \u2192 Hq) depending on the branching ratio being tested. Typically a reference branching ratio of BR(t \u2192 Hq) = 1% is used. The case of both top quarks decaying into Hq is neglected in the analysis given existing upper limits on BR(t \u2192 Hq) (see section 1). In order to improve the modelling of the signal kinematics, a two-step reweighting procedure is applied: the first step is designed to correct the spectrum of top quark p T and tt system p T to match that of the uncorrected tt \u2192 W bW b Powheg-Box+Pythia sample; the second step involves the same correction to the top quark p T and tt system p T applied to the tt+jets background (see discussion above).",

Because of the better signal-to-background ratio in the (4 j, 4 b) channel, this analysis is expected to have better sensitivity for tt \u2192 W bHc than for tt \u2192 W bHu signal. The rest of the channels have significantly lower signal-tobackground ratios, but they are useful for calibrating the tt+jets background prediction and constraining the related systematic uncertainties (see section 7) through a likelihood fit to data (see section 8). This strategy was first used in the ATLAS search for ttH associated production, with H \u2192 bb [21], and is adopted in this analysis.

The corresponding pdfs are constructed as unit-normalised onedimensional histograms. To compute M \u03bdb , the neutrino four-momentum is needed, which is reconstructed as follows. Initially, the x and y components of the neutrino momentum, p x,\u03bd and p y,\u03bd , are identified with those of the reconstructed E miss T vector. The z component of the neutrino momentum, p z,\u03bd , is inferred by solving M 2 W = (p + p \u03bd ) 2 , with M W = 80.4 GeV being the W boson mass. If two real solutions (\"2sol\") exist, they are sorted according to their absolute value of |p z,\u03bd | i.e., |p z,\u03bd1 | < |p z,\u03bd2 |. It is found that in 62% of the cases p z,\u03bd1 is closer than p z,\u03bd2 to the generator-level neutrino p z,\u03bd . In this case, two different pdfs are constructed, one for each solution, and P sig 2sol (M \u03bdb ) is defined as the average of the two pdfs weighted by their fractions (0.62 for p z,\u03bd1 and 0.38 for p z,\u03bd2 ). If no real solution (\"nosol\") exists, which happens in about 30% of the cases, the p x,\u03bd and p y,\u03bd components are scaled by a common factor until the discriminant of the quadratic equation is exactly zero, yielding only one solution for p z,\u03bd . This solution for p z,\u03bd is used to compute M \u03bdb , from which the corresponding P sig nosol (M \u03bdb ) is constructed. In the calculation of P sig kin (x) from equation (6.2), P sig (M \u03bdb ) is identified with P sig 2sol (M \u03bdb ) or with P sig nosol (M \u03bdb ), depending on how many neutrino solutions can be found for the event.

Table 1 presents a list of all systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis and indicates whether they are taken to be normalisation-only, or to affect both shape and normalisation. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty vary depending on the analysis channel considered, but they typically originate from tt+jets modelling (including tt+HF) and btagging. For example, the total systematic uncertainty in the background normalisation in the (4 j, 4 b) channel, which dominates the sensitivity in the case of the tt \u2192 W bHc search, is approximately 20%, with the largest contributions originating from tt+HF normalisation, b-tagging efficiency, c-tagging efficiency, light-jet tagging efficiency and tt cross section. However, as shown in section 9, the fit to data in the nine analysis channels allows the overall background uncertainty to be reduced significantly, to approximately 4.4%. The reduced uncertainty results from the significant constraints provided by the data on some systematic uncertainties, as well as the anti-correlations among sources of systematic uncertainty resulting from the fit to the data. The total systematic uncertainty on the tt \u2192 W bHc signal normalisation in the (4 j, 4 b) channel is approximately 17%, with similar contributions from uncertainties related to b-tagging and overall signal modelling. After the fit, this uncertainty is reduced to 7.8%.

Additional uncertainties originating from the modelling of the underlying JHEP12(2015)061 event, in particular its impact on the p T scale and resolution of unclustered energy, are negligibly small. The leading uncertainties associated with reconstructed objects in this analysis originate from the modelling of the b-, c-, and light-jet-tagging efficiencies in the simulation, which is corrected to match the efficiencies measured in data control samples [36,95] through dedicated scale factors. Uncertainties on these factors include a total of six independent sources affecting b-jets and four independent sources affecting c-jets. Each of these uncertainties has a different jet-p T dependence. Twelve sources of uncertainty affecting light jets are considered, which depend on jet p T and \u03b7. The above sources of systematic uncertainty are taken as uncorrelated between b-jets, c-jets, and light-jets. They have their largest impact in the (4 j, 4 b) channel, resulting in 10%, 13%, and 18% normalisation uncertainties on the tt + bb, tt + cc, and tt+light-jets background associated with the uncertainties on the b-, c-, and light-jet-tagging scale factors, respectively. An additional uncertainty is included due to the extrapolation of these scale factors to jets with p T beyond the kinematic reach of the data calibration samples used (p T > 300 GeV for b-and c-jets, and p T > 750 GeV for light-jets), taken to be correlated among the three jet flavours. This uncertainty has a very small impact in this analysis (e.g. < 0.2% on the signal and background normalisations in the (4 j, 4 b) channel).",

Uncertainties associated with the reweighting procedure applied to tt+light-jets and tt + cc processes include the nine leading sources of uncertainty in the differential cross-section measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV [61]. Additional uncertainties assigned to the modelling of the tt + cc background include a 50% normalisation uncertainty, the full differences between applying and not applying the reweightings of the top quark and tt p T spectra, as well as smaller uncertainties associated with the choice of LO generator. Uncertainties affecting the modelling of tt + bb production include a normalisation uncertainty of 50% (taken to be uncorrelated with the same uncertainty assigned to the tt + cc background) and shape uncertainties (including inter-category migration effects) associated with the NLO prediction from Sherpa+OpenLoops, which is used for reweighting of the default Powheg-Box tt + bb prediction. These include three different scale variations, a different shower-recoil model scheme, and two alternative PDF sets (MSTW and NNPDF). Additional uncertainties are assessed for the contributions to the tt + bb background originating from multiple parton interactions or final-state radiation from top decay products, which are not part of the NLO prediction.

Figures 4-6 show a comparison of the data and prediction in the final discriminant in each of the analysis channels, both preand post-fit to data, in the case of the tt \u2192 W bHc search. The post-fit yields can be found in appendix A. The best-fit branching ratio obtained is BR(t \u2192 Hc) = [0.17 \u00b1 0.12 (stat.) \u00b1 0.17 (syst.)]%, assuming that BR(t \u2192 Hu) = 0. A similar fit is performed for the tt \u2192 W bHu search, yielding BR(t \u2192 Hu) = [\u22120.07 \u00b1 0.17 (stat.) \u00b1 0.28 (syst.)]%, assuming that BR(t \u2192 Hc) = 0. The different measured values for the two branching ratios is the result of the different sensitivities of the tt \u2192 W bHc and tt \u2192 W bHu searches, as discussed in section 6.1. The large number of events in the analysis channels considered, together with their different background compositions, allows the fit to place constraints on the combined effect of several sources of systematic uncertainty. As a result, an improved background prediction is obtained with significantly reduced uncertainty, not only in the signal-depleted channels, but also in the most sensitive analysis channels for this search, (4 j, 3 b) and (4 j, 4 b). The channels with two b-tags are used to constrain the leading uncertainties affecting the tt+light-jets background prediction, while the channels with \u22655 jets and \u22653 b-tags are JHEP12(2015)061 sensitive to the uncertainties affecting the tt+HF background prediction. In particular, one of the main corrections applied by the fit is an increase of the tt + bb normalisation by approximately 20% relative to the nominal prediction by adjusting the corresponding nuisance parameter. This results in an improved agreement between data and prediction in the (5 j, \u22654 b) and (\u22656 j, \u22654 b) channels, where the tt + bb process provides a significant, or, in the latter case, dominant background contribution. 6 In addition, the corresponding uncertainty is reduced from the initial 50% down to about 16%. This correction is in agreement with that found in ref. [21]. However, in contrast with ref.",

The significant impact from light-jet tagging results from the large fraction of tt+light-jets background present in the (4 j, 4 b) channel, which peaks at high values of the final discriminant, like the signal, and thus cannot be strongly constrained by the fit. Because of this, this uncertainty remains the leading one after the fit. In contrast, the uncertainty related to tt modelling is significantly constrained by the fit since it has a large impact (\u223c5-16%) on the tt+light-jets background normalisation in the highly populated channels with two b-tags. As a result, this uncertainty is ranked only fourth in importance after the fit, becoming comparable to uncertainties such as the choice of renormalisation scale for tt + bb, the leading uncertainty for c-jet tagging and the tt + cc normalisation. Of these, the nuisance parameter associated with the choice of the renormalisation scale for tt + bb is slightly pulled (by half of the prior uncertainty) to improve agreement with the data in the (4 j, 4 b) and (5 j, 4 b) channels. In these channels, this uncertainty causes variations of up to \u223c5% in the bin contents in some regions of the final discriminant, i.e. distorting its shape compared to that of the nominal prediction, but the sensitivity is not sufficient to constrain it significantly.

Because the number of non-prompt leptons increases significantly as the lepton p T requirement is lowered, this region is dominated by the non-prompt contribution for any non-excluded value of BR(t \u2192 Hq). To extract the non-prompt background yields in these regions, binned likelihood fits to the subleading lepton p T distribution are performed, accounting for non-prompt lepton backgrounds, sources of prompt leptons (normalised to the SM expectation), and a potential tt \u2192 W bHq contribution. The fitted tt \u2192 W bHq contribution is in all cases found to be compatible with zero. The obtained best-fit non-prompt background yields in these low-p T control regions are used to normalise the simulation and obtain estimates for the background in the 2 0\u03c4 had signal regions. These are found to be compatible with the nominal data-driven predictions within the stated uncertainties. The nominal predictions of the non-prompt backgrounds and their associated uncertainties are therefore used without modification in this reinterpretation.

The analysis searches for top quark pair events in which one top quark decays to W b, with the W boson decaying leptonically, and the other top quark decays to Hq. The search is based on pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and uses an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon with moderately high transverse momentum and at least four jets. In this search the dominant background process is tt \u2192 W bW b. To separate the signal from the background, the search exploits the high multiplicity of b-quark jets characteristic of signal events, and JHEP12(2015)061 employs a likelihood discriminant that combines information from invariant mass distributions and the flavour of the jets. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits of 0.56% (0.42%) and 0.61% (0.64%) are derived for the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios respectively.",

All searches discussed in this paper have comparable sensitivity, and thus their combination represents a significant improvement over the individual results. The observed (expected) 95% CL combined upper limits on the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios are 0.46% (0.25%) and 0.45% (0.29%) respectively.
