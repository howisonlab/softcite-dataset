The inclusive search for the SM Higgs decay to two b quarks at the LHC is of great interest, since the measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to b quarks is an important test of the SM [4]. Several extensions of the SM predict that new heavy particles that decay to two energetic b quarks could be accessible at LHC collision energies [5][6][7]. A sizeable Z \u2192 bb event sample will enable the measurement of the bb forward-central asymmetry at the Z pole, which could be enhanced by the contributions from new physics processes [8]. The forward-central asymmetry in inclusive bb events has previously been measured by the LHCb collaboration [9].",

The analysis of the ATLAS collaboration reconstructed boosted Z \u2192 bb candidates in the central region of pp collisions at 8 TeV, with pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.5, and determined the cross-section with a relative uncertainty of 16%. The CMS collaboration made the first observation of the Z \u2192 bb decay in a single-jet topology in the same pseudorapidity region, with a significance of 5.1 standard deviations. This Letter describes a new method to study the Z \u2192 bb decay, performed on pp collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 . The low trigger thresholds on the particle energies that are employed at LHCb and the excellent b-jet identification performance make it possible to select candidates within a large invariant mass range, including those with masses below the Z -boson pole. Events are selected requiring two b-jet candidates, referred to as a b dijet, and an additional jet that balances the transverse momentum of the bb system. The invariant mass distribution of the b dijet is used to determine the Z \u2192 bb yield and the b-jet energy scale. The invariant mass distribution of the QCD background is determined using a control region that is defined through observables related to the b-dijet system and to the associated balancing jet. Simulated data are used to evaluate the reconstruction efficiency and the detector acceptance, enabling a measurement of the Z production cross-section multiplied by the Z \u2192 bb branching fraction.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a siliconstrip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 1 The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 the number of hits in the SPD is applied in order to prevent highmultiplicity events from dominating the processing time. At the software trigger stage events are required to have a two-, threeor four-track secondary vertex (SV) with significant displacement from any primary vertex. A multivariate algorithm [15] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron, strongly suppressing the contamination from charmed hadrons. Simulated events generated with Pythia [16], with a specific LHCb configuration [17], are used to model the properties of the signal Z \u2192 bb events and backgrounds such as Z \u2192 cc, W \u2192 qq decays and tt events. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [18], where the final-state radiation is generated using Photos [19]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [20] as described in Ref. [21].",

The two heavy-flavour jets are each required to have transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV, pseudorapidities in the range 2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.2, and a combined invariant mass (m jj ) in the range 45 < m jj < 165 GeV. The fiducial region of the measurement within which the cross-section is determined is defined by the kinematical requirements described above applied to particle-level jets, which are jets reconstructed in the simulation from stable particles (i.e. particles with lifetime in excess of 10 ps, excluding neutrinos) using the default reconstruction algorithm.",

A uniform Gradient Boost Boosted Decision Tree technique [31] is adopted, in order to ensure a selection efficiency with a low dependence on the dijet invariant mass. The classifier is trained using four kinematical variables of the three-jet system, chosen for both their low correlation with the dijet invariant mass and for their discriminating power. The variables are the absolute pseudorapidity difference between the two heavy-flavour jets, the p T of the balancing jet, the angle between the balancing-jet momentum and the Z -boson candidate momentum in the azimuthal plane with respect to the beam axis, and the polar angle between the balancing-jet momentum and the Z -boson flight direction in the Z -boson rest frame. The classifier is trained using 5% of the data sample to represent the combinatorial QCD background. This training sample has a negligible Z \u2192 bb, Z \u2192 cc, W \u2192 qq and tt contamination and it is not used in the dijet invariant mass fit described below. The signal process is modelled using simulated Z \u2192 bb events.

Since one of the two b-jet candidates must be tagged by a SV selected by the software trigger, the uncertainty on this trigger efficiency is included in this contribution. The systematic uncertainty associated with the hardware trigger efficiency is determined by measuring the efficiency with a tag-and-probe technique, using the high purity Z (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) + jet data sample [24]. In order to avoid trigger bias on the jet selection, the tag is the muon that triggered the event and the probe is the associated jet. The hardware trigger efficiency measured on probe jets is compared between data and simulation and the maximum difference in intervals of the jet p T is taken as an uncertainty. The latter does not take into account the systematic uncertainty on the GEC efficiency, which is determined separately by studying its dependence on the b-dijet invariant mass and assigning the largest variation as the uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty on the jet energy correction includes biases due to jet flavour dependence, reconstruction of tracks which are not associated to a real particle, the track momentum resolution and residual differences between simulation and data, as described in Refs. [24,25]. The jet energy resolution is modelled in simulation with an uncertainty measured in Refs. [23,25]. The uncertainties related to the jet reconstruction and identification are taken from Ref.

This bias is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty associated with the transfer functions is evaluated by repeating the fit using second-order polynomial functions instead of linear functions. In these fits the coefficients of the quadratic terms are varied in a range consistent with the data in the invariant mass sidebands used in the determination of the transfer functions. The maximum variation with respect to the default measurement is taken as the uncertainty. The efficiency ratio R is determined using both Z (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) + jet data and simulation, and the observed difference is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with a possible bias introduced by the fit procedure is determined using pseudoexperiments.",

The uncertainty on the strong coupling is included by varying it within its uncertainty and recalculating the cross-section. The uncertainty on the PDFs is estimated by taking the variance of the cross-section predictions, where each replica of the NNPDF3.0 set is used in turn. The prediction and the measurement are compatible within one standard deviation. The additional data being collected by the LHCb collaboration will allow a more stringent comparison with the theoretical prediction in the future.
