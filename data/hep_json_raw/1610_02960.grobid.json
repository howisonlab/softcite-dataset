The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 2.7 fb \u22121 , respectively. The Z bosons are reconstructed from opposite-sign electron or muon pairs. No statistically significant deviation from the standard model predictions has been found in the 200-2000 GeV mass range. Upper limits at 95% confidence level have been derived on the product of the scalar particle production cross section and the branching fraction of the Z decaying into electrons or muons, which range from 280 to 20 fb for resonance masses between 200 and 2000 GeV.",

            "text": "The ATLAS and CMS experiments have observed [1][2][3] a standard model (SM) like Higgs boson at 125 GeV [4]. While this discovery has reaffirmed the SM, it is widely believed that the SM is a low-energy approximation of a more complex theory [5]. An enhancement with respect to the SM in the rate of rare decays of the 125 GeV boson or the discovery of additional scalar or pseudoscalar bosons would provide evidence that this is the case. Searches for the rare decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon have been conducted by both ATLAS and CMS [6,7], but have insufficient sensitivity to probe the SM Higgs boson hypothesis. In the context of the wider search for new resonances in the diphoton final state [8][9][10], information from the Z\u03b3 channel provides important complementary information. For example, an extended SM incorporating a scalar (or pseudoscalar) decaying to two photons would imply that Z\u03b3 decays should be observed as well [11].",

The dominant backgrounds consist of the irreducible contribution from the continuum Z\u03b3 production and the reducible backgrounds from either final-state radiation in Z JHEP01 (2017)076boson decays or Z boson production in association with one or more jets (Z plus jets), where a jet is misidentified as a photon.

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, 13 m in length and 6 m in diameter, which provides an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume there are several particle detection systems. Charged-particle trajectories are measured by silicon pixel and strip trackers, covering 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is partitioned into a barrel region with |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| = 3. A brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter surrounds the ECAL volume and covers the region |\u03b7| < 3. Iron forward calorimeters with quartz fibers, read out by photomultipliers, extend the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 5. The calorimeters provide measurements of the energy of photons, electrons, and hadronic jets. Lead and silicon-strip preshower detectors are located in front of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction. A two-tier trigger system selects proton-proton collision events of interest.",

The relative isolation of the lepton is quantified by summing the transverse momenta of the relevant PF candidates within this cone, excluding the lepton itself. To account for the contamination from pileup interactions, charged particles originating from additional vertices are excluded from the estimate, and a correction is applied to account for the neutral PF objects originating from pileup activity, which cannot be excluded by vertex identification. The resulting quantity, divided by the lepton transverse momentum, is required to be less than 0.4 for both electrons and muons in the analysis of 8 TeV data, and less than 0.1 (0.2) for electrons (muons) in 13 TeV data. This requirement rejects misidentified leptons and background arising from hadronic jets. Finally, the separation between each lepton and the photon must satisfy \u2206R > 0.4 in order to reject events with final-state radiation. The invariant mass of the dilepton system is required to be greater than 50 GeV. In the selection used in 8 TeV data, no upper dilepton mass condition is needed, while in the selection used in 13 TeV data the dilepton mass is required to be below 130 GeV. The minimum dilepton mass requirement rejects contributions from pp \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 * , where an internal conversion of the photon produces a dilepton pair. In the rare cases where more than one dilepton pair is present, the one with an invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass is taken. The final set of requirements combines the information from the photon and the leptons: (i) the invariant mass M \u03b3 of the + \u2212 \u03b3 system (where = e, \u00b5), is required to be above 150 (200) GeV in the analysis of 8 (13) TeV data; and (ii) the ratio of the photon transverse energy to M \u03b3 must be greater than 0.27. This latter requirement suppresses backgrounds due to misidentification of photons, without significant loss in signal sensitivity and without introducing a bias in the M \u03b3 spectrum.",

Figure 5 shows the observed background-only p-values for the 8 TeV search (blue, dotted), the 13 TeV search (red, dashed), and their combination (black). The fluctuation at M \u03b3 \u2248 370 GeV corresponds to a local significance of 2.6 \u03c3, and a global significance smaller than one standard deviation, once the 'look-elsewhere' effect has been taken into account [34]. This has been computed by counting the fraction of times the background-only p-value crosses the level corresponding to 0.5 standard deviations in the full mass range in which limits are set.",

The background is measured directly from data and localized excesses are looked for. No significant deviation with respect to the standard model expectation is found. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of narrow resonances, ranging from 280 to 20 fb for resonance masses from 200 to 2000 GeV.",
