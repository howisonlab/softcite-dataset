Its current best determination was obtained by LHCb from a combination of measurements concerning B + , B 0 and B 0 s decays to final states with a D (s) meson and one or more light mesons [6]. Decay-time-dependent analyses of tree-level B 0 (s) \u2192 D \u2213 (s) h \u00b1 (h = \u03c0, K) decays 1 are sensitive to the angle \u03b3 through CP violation in the interference of mixing and decay JHEP03(2018)059 amplitudes [7][8][9][10]. A comparison between the value of the CKM angle \u03b3 obtained from treelevel processes, with the measurements of \u03b3 and other unitary triangle parameters in looplevel processes, provides a powerful consistency check of the SM picture of CP violation. Due to the interference between mixing and decay amplitudes, the physical CP -violating parameters in these decays are functions of a combination of the angle \u03b3 and the relevant mixing phase, namely \u03b3 + 2\u03b2 (\u03b2 \u2261 arg(\u2212",

After the event selection, an unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit, referred to as the multivariate fit, is performed to separate signal B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 candidates from background contributions. The multivariate fit uses the B 0 s and D \u2212 s invariant masses and the log-likelihood difference between the pion and kaon hypotheses, L(K/\u03c0), for the K \u00b1 candidate. Using information from this fit, signal weights for each candidate are obtained using the sPlot technique [21]. At the second stage, the CP violation parameters are measured from a fit to the weighted decay-time distribution, referred to as the sFit [22] procedure, where the initial flavour of the B 0 s candidate is inferred by means of several flavour-tagging algorithms optimised using data and simulation samples. The full procedure is validated using the flavour-specific B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decay, yielding approximately 16 times more signal than B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 decays. Precise determination of the decay-time resolution model and of the decay-time acceptance, as well as the calibration of the flavour-tagging algorithms, are obtained from B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decays and subsequently used in the sFit procedure to the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 candidates. The analysis strategy largely follows that described in ref. [19]. Most of the inputs are updated, in particular the candidate selection, the flavour tagging calibration and the decay-time resolution are optimised on the current data and simulation samples.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [25], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [26] placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data taking to control systematic effects. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Particle identification (PID) of charged hadrons is achieved using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [27].",

A scale factor accounting for data-simulation differences in the signal width is left free in the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + fit and is subsequently fixed to its measured value in the fit tothe B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 sample.The functional form of the combinatorial background is taken from the B 0 s invariant mass sideband (above 5800 MeV/c 2 ), with all parameters left free to vary in the multivariate fit. It is parametrised separately for each D \u2212 s mode either by an exponential function or by the sum of an exponential function and a constant offset. The shapes of the fully or partially reconstructed backgrounds are fixed from simulated events, corrected to reproduce the PID efficiency and kinematics in data, using a nonparametric kernel estimation method (KEYS) [42]. An exception is background due to B 0 mesons decaying to the same final state as signal, which is parametrised by the signal PDF shifted by the known B 0 -B 0 s mass difference. The D \u2212 s invariant mass is also described by a sum of two Crystal Ball functions with a common mean. The signal PDFs are obtained from simulation separately for each D \u2212 s decay mode. As for the B 0 s invariant mass signal shape, only the common mean and the width scale factor are left free in the fits; the B 0 s and D \u2212 s scale factors are different. The combinatorial background consists of random combinations of tracks that do not originate from a D \u2212 s meson decay and backgrounds that contain a true D \u2212 s decay combined with a random companion track. Its shape is parametrised, separately for each D \u2212 s decay mode, by a combination of an exponential function and the corresponding D \u2212 s signal PDF.
