The measurements are performed in single-lepton and dilepton final states in a fiducial volume. Events with exactly one photon, one or two leptons, a channel-dependent minimum number of jets, and at least one b-jet are selected. Neural network algorithms are used to separate the signal from the backgrounds. The fiducial cross-sections are measured to be 521 \u00b1 9(stat.) \u00b1 41(sys.) fb and 69 \u00b1 3(stat.) \u00b1 4(sys.) fb for the single-lepton and dilepton channels, respectively. The differential cross-sections are measured as a function of photon transverse momentum, photon absolute pseudorapidity, and angular distance between the photon and its closest lepton in both channels, as well as azimuthal opening angle and absolute pseudorapidity difference between the two leptons in the dilepton channel. All measurements are in agreement with the theoretical predictions.",

Studies of the production and kinematic properties of a top-quark pair in association with a photon (tt\u03b3 ) probe the t\u03b3 electroweak coupling. For instance, deviations in the transverse momentum ( p T ) spectrum of the photon from the SM prediction could point to new physics through anomalous dipole moments of the top quark [1][2][3]. A precision measurement of the tt\u03b3 production cross-section could effectively constrain some of the Wilson coefficients in top-quark effective field theories [4]. Furthermore, differential distributions of photon production in tt events could provide insight on e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch the tt production mechanism, in particular about the tt spin correlation and the charge asymmetry [5].",

The photon can originate not only from a top quark, but also from its charged decay products, including a charged fermion (quark or lepton) from the decay of the W -boson. In addition, it can be radiated from an incoming charged parton. In this analysis, no attempt is made to separate these different sources of photons, but criteria are applied to suppress those radiated from topquark decay products: e.g. by requiring the photon to have a large angular distance from the lepton(s). In each channel, the fiducial inclusive cross-section, referred to as fiducial crosssection in the following for simplicity, is measured with a likelihood fit to the output of a neural network trained to differentiate between signal and background events. In both channels, differential cross-sections, normalized to unity, are measured in the same fiducial region without performing the likelihood fit, as a function of the photon p T , the photon |\u03b7|, and the distance R between the photon and its closest lepton. The distance R between two objects is defined as the quadratic sum of their pseudorapidity difference \u03b7 and azimuthal opening angle \u03c6. In the dilepton channel, the normalized differential cross-sections are also measured as a function of the absolute pseudorapidity difference | \u03b7| and \u03c6 between the two leptons, the latter being sensitive to the spin correlation of the tt pair .The measured cross-sections are compared to predictions from leading order (LO) generators. The predictions for the inclusive cross-sections are corrected by next-to-leading order (NLO) k-factors [10] in the strong interaction, calculated at parton level.",

It surrounds the beam pipe and is located inside a superconducting solenoid, operating with a magnetic field of 2 T. An additional silicon pixel layer, the insertable B-layer, was added between 3 and 4 cm from the beam line to improve b-hadron tagging [12,13] for Run 2. The calorimeter outside the ID is divided into two subsystems. The inner subsystem is the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and the second is the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). The outermost layer is the third main component of the ATLAS detector: the muon spectrometer (MS), which is within a magnetic field provided by air-core toroid magnets with a bending integral of about 2.5 Tm in the barrel and up to 6 Tm in the endcaps. The ID provides tracking information from silicon pixel and silicon microstrip detectors in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and from a transition radiation tracker (TRT) covering |\u03b7| < 2.0. The magnetic field of the superconducting solenoid bends charged particles for the momentum measurement. The ECAL uses lead absorbers and liquid argon (LAr) as active medium and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. The HCAL is composed of a steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, that cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements respectively, and covering the region 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The MS measures the deflection of muon tracks within |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers in toroidal fields of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T in the central and end-cap regions, respectively. The MS is instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

The production of a vector boson (V = W, Z ) in association with a photon (V \u03b3 ) was simulated with Sherpa v2.2.2 [27], and the inclusive production of V +jets [28] was simulated with Sherpa v2.2.1, both using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set. The s-channel single top quark and t W samples [24] were produced with Powheg-Box v1 using the CT10 (NLO) PDF set [29], interfaced with Pythia v6.428 using the Perugia 2012 tune set [30] and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [23]. The t-channel single top quark was produced with the same generator and parton shower, with the four-flavour scheme and the corresponding CT104fs PDF set [23]. The diboson samples of W W , W Z and Z Z [31] were generated by Sherpa v2.1, using the CT10 (NLO) PDF set. The tt V samples [32] were generated with MG5_aMC v2.2 using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set, interfaced with Pythia v8.210 using the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. For all samples without photon radiation in the matrix element calculation, the radiation was simulated by the corresponding parton shower. The EvtGen program [33] was used to simulate the decay of bottom and charm hadrons, except for the Sherpa samples. All these samples were generated with NLO precision in QCD and, in the case of Sherpa samples, the NLO calculations were performed for up to one or two additional partons.",

An alternative tt sample was generated to enhance the parton shower radiation, with the renormalization and factorization scales varied down by a factor of two, the high radiation variation of the A14 Var3c tune parameter and the h damp value increased by a factor of two. A corresponding tt sample with reduced parton shower radiation was generated with the renormalization and factorization scales multiplied by a factor of two and the low radiation variation of the A14 Var3c tune parameter. The uncertainty arising from the choice of tt generator is evaluated using a Sherpa v2.2 sample.

These decomposed uncertainties are illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12 for the single-lepton and dilepton channels, respectively. For the single-lepton channel, the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the tt modelling, which is used to model the shapes of the hadronic-fake and electronfake backgrounds. For the dilepton channel, the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the Z \u03b3 modelling, mostly from the comparison between Sherpa and MG5_aMC+Pythia 8 generators. Because the unfolding is performed with the distributions before the fit, the background modelling uncertain- ties are not constrained as in the case of fiducial cross-section measurement where a fit to ELD distribution is performed, and thus they have a much larger impact on the result. The differences between the unfolded and the predicted distributions are quantified by the chi-squared per degree of freedom \u03c7 2 /ndf, where the \u03c7 2 is",
