In this Letter, results from both experiments are combined with those from the Bugey-3 reactor neutrino experiment to constrain oscillations into light sterile neutrinos. The three experiments are sensitive to complementary regions of parameter space, enabling the combined analysis to probe regions allowed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments in a minimally extended four-neutrino flavor framework. Stringent limits on sin 2 2\u03b8\u00b5e are set over six orders of magnitude in the sterile mass-squared splitting \u2206m 2 41 . The sterile-neutrino mixing phase space allowed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments is excluded for \u2206m 2 41 < 0.8 eV 2 at 95% CLs.",

For \u2206m 2 41 \u2208 (0.005, 0.05) eV 2 , the muon neutrino CC spectrum in the FD would display deviations from three-flavor oscillations. For rapid oscillations driven by \u2206m 2 41 \u2208 (0.05, 0.5) eV 2 , the combination of finite detector energy resolution and rapid oscillations at the FD location would result in an apparent event rate depletion between the ND and FD. For larger sterile neutrino masses, corresponding to \u2206m 2 41 >0.5 eV 2 , oscillations into sterile neutrinos would distort the ND CC energy spectrum. Additional sensitivity is obtained by analyzing the reconstructed energy spectrum for NC candidates. The NC cross sections and interaction topologies are identical for all three active neutrino flavors, rendering the NC spectrum insensitive to standard oscillations, but mixing with a sterile neutrino state would deplete the NC energy spectrum at the FD, as the sterile neutrino would not interact in the detector. For large sterile neutrino masses, such depletion would also be measurable at the ND.",

            "text": "The Daya Bay experiment measures electron antineutrinos via inverse beta decay (IBD):\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n. The antineutrinos are produced by six reactor cores and detected in eight identical Gd-doped liquid-scintillator detectors (ADs) [33] in three underground experimental halls (EHs). The fluxaveraged baselines for EH1, EH2, and EH3 are 520, 570, and 1590 m, respectively. The target mass in each of the two near EHs is 40 tons, and that in the far EH is 80 tons. Details of the IBD event selection, background estimates, and assessment of systematic uncertainties can be found in [29,34]. By searching for distortions in the\u03bd e energy spectra, the experiment is sensitive to sin 2 2\u03b8 14 for a mass-splitting \u2206m 2 41 \u2208 (0.0003, 0.2) eV 2 . For \u2206m 2 41 > 0.2 eV 2 , spectral distortions cannot be resolved by the detector. Instead, the measured antineutrino flux can be compared with the predicted flux to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space. Recently, Daya Bay published its measurement of the overall antineutrino flux [35]. The result is consistent with previous measurements at short baselines, which prefer 5% lower values than the latest calculations [36,37], a deficit commonly referred to as the reactor antineutrino anomaly [38]. However, the reactor spectrum measurement from Daya Bay [35] (and from RENO [30] and Double Chooz [31]) shows clear discrepancies with the latest calculations, which indicates an underestimation of their uncertainties. The uncertainties on the antineutrino flux models for this analysis are increased to 5% from the original 2% as suggested by [39,40]. The Daya Bay Collaboration has recently updated the sterile neutrino search result in [14] with limits on sin 2 2\u03b8 14 improved by about a factor of two with respect to previous results [41]. This data set is used in producing the combined results presented here.",

The first analysis uses the predicted\u03bd e spectrum to generate the predicted prompt spectrum for each AD simultaneously, taking into account detector effects such as energy resolution, nonlinearity, detector efficiency, and oscillation parameters described in [29]. A log-likelihood function is constructed with nuisance parameters to include the detector-related uncertainties and a covariance matrix to incorporate the uncertainties on reactor neutrino flux prediction. The Gaussian CL s method is used to calculate the excluded region. The second analysis uses the observed spectra at the near sites to predict the far site spectra to further reduce the dependency on reactor antineutrino flux models. Both analyses yield consistent results [14].  [16], for the reproduced Bugey-3 with adjusted fluxes, for the Daya Bay result [14], and for the combined Daya Bay and reproduced Bugey-3 results.

To achieve the combination with Daya Bay, two changes are made in the reproduced Bugey-3 analysis: the change in cross section of the IBD process due to the updated neutron decay time [6] is applied; and the antineutrino flux is adjusted from the ILL+Vogel model [43,44] to that of Huber [36] and Mueller [37], for consistency with the prediction used by Daya Bay. These adjustments change the reproduced contour with respect to the original Bugey-3 one, in particular by reducing sensitivity to regions with \u2206m 2 41 > 3 eV 2 , with less noticeable effects for smaller \u2206m 2 41 values. The reproduced Bugey-3 limit on the sterile neutrino mixing, and the limit obtained by combining Bugey-3 with Daya Bay results through a \u03c7 2 fit, with common overall normalization and oscillation parameters, are shown in Fig. 2.",

We then combine pairs of grid points from the MINOS and the Daya Bay/Bugey-3 results at fixed values of \u2206m 2 41 to obtain constraints on electron neutrino or antineutrino appearance due to oscillations into sterile neutrinos. Since the systematic uncertainties of accelerator and reactor experiments are largely uncorrelated, for each (sin 2 2\u03b8 14 , sin 2 \u03b8 24 , \u2206m 2 41 ) grid point, a combined \u2206\u03c7 2 obs is constructed from the sum of the corresponding MINOS and Daya Bay/Bugey-3 \u2206\u03c7 2 obs values.

A \u2206\u03c7 2 value of 48.2 is found between the data and this 4\u03bd prediction.

Eq. (5)). To obtain a singlevalued function, we make the conservative choice of selecting the largest CL s value for any given sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e . The 90% CL s exclusion contour resulting from this procedure is shown in Fig. 4. Under the assumption of CPT conservation, the combined constraints are equally valid in constraining electron neutrino or antineutrino appearance. The combined results of Daya Bay/Bugey-3 and MINOS constrain sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e < [3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (90% CL s ), 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (95% CL s )] for \u2206m 2 41 = 1.2 eV 2 . In conclusion, we have combined constraints on sin 2 2\u03b8 14 derived from a search for electron antineutrino disappearance at the Daya Bay and Bugey-3 reactor experiments with constraints on sin 2 \u03b8 24 derived from a search for muon (anti)neutrino disappearance in the NuMI beam at the MINOS experiment. Assuming a four-flavor model of active-sterile oscillations, we constrain sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e , the parameter controlling electron (anti)neutrino appearance at short-baseline experiments, over six orders of magnitude in \u2206m 2 41 . We set the strongest constraint to date and exclude the sterile neutrino mixing phase space allowed by the LSND and Mini-BooNE experiments for \u2206m 2 41 < 0.8 eV 2 at a 95% CL s . Our results are in good agreement with results from global fits (see [13,47] and references therein) at specific parameter choices, however they differ in detail over the range of parameter space. The results explicitly show the strong ten-  [45] and NOMAD [46] are also shown.
