In this analysis the reconstruction of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons has been done via photon conversions in the central tracking system of ALICE. Therefore, this method is completely independent from the electromagnetic calorimeters. It makes the \u03c0 0 (\u03b7) measurement possible down to p t = 0.4 (0.6) GeV/c with a very good resolution and a very small background. For 10 8 pp collisions the p t reach is 7 GeV/c. The results are compared to NLO pQCD calculations.",

The measurement of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra provides a test of the applicability of pertubative QCD (pQCD) calculations at this energy. These spectra are also essential to extract direct photons from the large decay background coming mainly from \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 decays. Once the direct photon spectrum is extracted in heavy ion collisions, one can obtain information like temperature and pressure about the quark gluon plasma (QGP). In addition, the corrected \u03c0 0 transverse momentum spectrum in proton-proton collisions will serve as a baseline to study a possible \u03c0 0 suppression in heavy ion collisions at LHC energies.",

For both mesons the decay into two photons are the main decay channels with a branching ratio of 98.8% and 39.3%, respectively. A photon with an energy above 1.02 MeV interacts with matter mainly via pair production. It converts in the Coulomb field of a nucleus into an e + e \u2212 pair. The photon reconstruction is done with an algorithm for displaced vertices. These can be either K 0 s , \u039b or\u039b decays, photon conversions or hadronic interactions in the detector material. In order to select photons from this sample, several cuts are applied. These are for example constraints on the energy loss of the track in the TPC to identify electron and positron candidates and on the mass and the pointing direction of the reconstructed photon candidate [3]. Furthermore, a condition is used that the tracks should be parallel at the conversion point, otherwise the resolution of the location suffers. With the conversion method a precise \u03b3-ray tomography of the ALICE experiment can be obtained with a resolution of the location of the conversion points better than 3 cm in radial direction R, 1.5 cm in beam direction Z and 2.5 mrad in \u03d5 (see figure 2). This provides an important check of the amount of material in the detector and its implementation in GEANT. From detailed comparison of data and simulation the material budget of 0.11 X 0 is known with an accuracy of \u00b16% within a photon acceptance of |\u03b7| < 0.9 (figure 3). To determine the conversion probability and the reconstruction efficiency for photons, studies using simulated data have been performed. Within the chosen acceptance the conversion probability is 8.5% for p t > 0.8 GeV/c. The photon reconstruction efficiency, defined as reconstructed photons, that are verified by their Monte Carlo information, divided by the number of converted photons, is found to be around 65% at high p t . Since conversion probability and reconstruction efficiency enter squared in the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson reconstruction due to the fact of the decay into two photons the efficiency of the method is below 0.3%.

Clear peaks at the mass positions of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons on top of a combinatorial background can be seen. In order to extract the meson yields the invariant mass distribution is sliced into several p t bins. For the \u03c0 0 meson a clear peak is visible in the p t range from 0.4 GeV/c to 7 GeV/c and for the \u03b7 in a range of 0.6 GeV/c to 6 GeV/c, respectively. For the determination of the combinatorial background a mixed event technique within the same photon multiplicity and z vertex position class is used. The calculated background is normalized for every p t bin in the invariant mass range from 0.17 to 0.3 GeV/c 2 for the \u03c0 0 and 0.58 to 0.62 GeV/c 2 for the \u03b7, respectively, and subtracted.
