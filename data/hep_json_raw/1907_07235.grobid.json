The decay modes considered are final states that arise when one of the pseudoscalars decays to a pair of tau leptons, and the other one either into a pair of tau leptons or muons. The search is based on proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The 2\u03bc2\u03c4 and 4\u03c4 channels are used in combination to constrain the product of the Higgs boson production cross section and the branching fraction into 4\u03c4 final state, \u03c3 B, exploiting the linear dependence of the fermionic coupling strength of pseudoscalar bosons on the fermion mass. No significant excess is observed beyond the expectation from the standard model. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% confidence level on \u03c3 B, relative to the standard model Higgs boson production cross section, are set respectively between 0.022 and 0.23 and between 0.027 and 0.19 in the mass range probed by the analysis.",

The present analysis examines theoretical models that contain two Higgs doublets and an additional complex singlet Higgs field (denoted hereafter as 2HD+1S), that does not couple at tree level to fermions or gauge bosons and interacts only with itself and the Higgs doublets [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. In CP conserving models, which are considered in this Letter, the Higgs sector features seven physical states, namely three CP-even, two CP-odd, and two charged bosons, where one of the CP-even states corresponds to the H. This kind of Higgs sector is realized, for example, in next-to-minimal supersymmetric models that solve the so-called \u03bc problem of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM [11]. A large set of the 2HD+1S models is allowed by measurements and constraints set by searches for additional Higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles [12][13][14][15][16][17].",

This Letter addresses specific 2HD+1S models in which the lightest pseudoscalar boson (a 1 ) with mass 2m a 1 < 125 GeV has a large singlet component, and therefore its couplings to SM particles are significantly reduced. For this reason, analyses using direct production modes of a 1 , such as gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) or b quark associated production, have limited sensitivity. The a 1 boson is nonetheless potentially accessible in the H decay to two pseudoscalar bosons. The a 1 states can be identified via their decay into a pair of fermions [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. Constraints on the H couplings allow a branching fraction for H decays into non-SM particles as large as 34% [26], which can potentially accommodate the H \u2192 a 1 a 1 decay at a rate sufficiently high for detection at the LHC.",

            "text": "The branching fraction a 1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 depends on the details of the model, namely the parameter tan \u03b2, the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and on which Higgs doublet couples to either charged leptons, up-type quarks or down-type quarks [41]. In Type-II 2HD+1S models, where one Higgs doublet couples to up-type fermions while the other couples to down-type fermions, the a 1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay rate gets enhanced at large values of tan \u03b2. The branching fraction of this decay reaches values above 90% at tan \u03b2 > 3 for 2m \u03c4 < m a 1 < 2m b , where m \u03c4 is the mass of the tau lepton and m b is the mass of the bottom quark. For higher values of m a 1 the branching fraction decreases to 5-6% since the decay into a pair of bottom quarks becomes kinematically possible and overwhelms the decay into a pair of tau leptons. However, in some of the 2HD+1S models the a 1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay may be dominant even above the a 1 \u2192 bb decay threshold. This is realized, e.g., for tan \u03b2 > 1 in the Type-III 2HD+1S models, where one Higgs doublet couples to charged leptons, whereas the other doublet couples to quarks [41]. The signal topology targeted by the present analysis is illustrated in Fig. 1. Each a 1 boson is identified by the presence of a muon and only one additional charged particle, the objective of this approach being the decay channels a 1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and a 1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 one-prong . The \u03c4 \u03bc denotes the muonic tau lepton decay, and \u03c4 one-prong stands for its leptonic or one-prong hadronic decay. The three-prong modes are not used because of the very high QCD multijet background and lower reconstruction signal efficiency.",

This will result in a signature with two muons, each of which is accompanied by a nearby particle of opposite charge. The search focuses primarily on the dominant ggF process, in which the H state is produced with relatively small transverse momentum p T , and the a 1 pseudoscalars are emitted nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane, with a large separation in azimuth \u03c6 between the particles originating from one of the a 1 decays and those of the other a 1 . In the ggF process, the H can be also produced with a relatively high Lorentz boost when a hard gluon is radiated from the initial-state gluons or from the heavy-quark loop. In this case, the separation in \u03c6 is reduced, but the separation in pseudorapidity \u03b7 can be large.",

This observation indicates that the invariant mass of the muontrack system, making up an a 1 candidate, weakly depends on the isolation requirement imposed on the second muon, thus supporting the assumption that the f 1D (i) distribution can be determined from the N 23 CR. The potential dependence of the muon-track invariant mass distribution on the isolation requirement imposed on the second muon is verified also by comparing shapes in the control regions N 23 and N 45 . The latter CR is defined by requiring the presence of 4 or 5 \"isolation\" tracks nearby to the second muon, while the first muon-track pair passes selection criteria for the a 1 candidate. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4. A slight difference is observed between distributions in these two CRs. This difference is taken as a shape uncertainty in the normalized template f 1D ( j) entering Eq. (3). Fig. 5 presents the normalized invariant mass distribution of the muon-track system for data selected in the SR and for the background model derived from the N 23 CR. The data and background distributions are compared to the signal distributions, obtained from simulation, for four representative mass hypotheses, m a 1 = 4, 7, 10, and 15 GeV. The invariant mass of the muon-track system is found to have higher discrimination power between the background and the signal at higher m a 1 . For lower masses, the signal shape becomes more background like, resulting in a reduction of discrimination power.",

It consists of events that contain two SC muons passing the identification and kinematic selection criteria outlined in Section 4. Each muon is required to have two or three nearby tracks. One of them should belong to the category of \"signal\" tracks, whereas remaining tracks should belong to the category of \"soft\" tracks. About 36k data events are selected in this CR. The simulation predicts that the QCD multijet events dominate this CR, comprising more than 99% of selected events. It was also found that the overall background-to-signal ratio is enhanced compared to the SR by a factor of 30 to 40, depending on the mass hypothesis, m a 1 . The event sample in this region is used to build the normalized distribution f 2D (i, j). Finally, the correlation factors C (i, j) are obtained according to Eq. (3) as  where f 1D (i) is the 1D normalized distribution with two entries per event (m 1 and m 2 ). The correlation factors C (i, j) derived from data in the Loose-Iso CR are presented in Fig. 6. To obtain estimates of C (i, j) in the signal region, the correlation factors derived in the Loose-Iso CR have to be corrected for the difference in C (i, j) between the signal region and Loose-Iso CR. This difference is assessed by comparing samples of simulated background events. The correlation factors estimated from simulation in the signal region and the Loose-Iso CR are presented in Fig. 7. The correlation factors in the signal region are then computed as",

The normalization of both signal and background are allowed to float freely in the fit. The systematic uncertainties affecting the normalization of the signal templates are incorporated in the fit via nuisance parameters with a log-normal prior probability density function. The shape-altering systematic uncertainties are represented by nuisance parameters whose variations cause continuous morphing of the signal or background template shape, and are assigned a Gaussian prior probability density functions. The bin-by-bin statistical uncertainties are assigned gamma prior probability density functions. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of (m 1 , m 2 ), where the notation for the bins follows that of Fig. 2.
