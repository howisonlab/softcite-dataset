            "text": "A scalar boson was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2] in 2012. It has been shown to have properties consistent with those predicted for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, H, through spin and coupling measurements [3,[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. These measurements are based on production of the Higgs boson via gluon-gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion and in association with a W or Z boson or a top quark pair. The SM predicts non-resonant Higgs boson pair production via top quark loops as well as through self-coupling. The SM HH production cross-section is computed to be 33.4 fb [11,12] at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including resummation of soft-gluon emission at next-to-next-toleading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for m H = 125.09 GeV. The actual production rate could be larger than that predicted in the SM due to a variety of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics effects. One such extension includes a modification to the SM Higgs self-coupling, \u03bb HHH , and another the existence of a new heavy resonance which decays into a pair of Higgs bosons. An important Higgs boson decay channel is H \u2192 V V ( * ) in which V can be either a W or Z boson, on or off-shell, and this paper focuses on the 4W final state [13] in both SM and BSM HH production scenarios. This work investigates HH production through three different processes. The first is (1.1) the SM HH production (non-resonant HH). The second and third are both BSM processes inspired by an extended Higgs sector, such as a two-Higgs-doublet model [14], in JHEP05(2019)124 which a neutral heavy Higgs boson, X [15] is produced and decays either (1.2) directly into two SM Higgs bosons (resonant HH) or (1.3) into a pair of new scalar bosons, S (X \u2192 SS), each of which in turn decays to other SM particles with the same mass-dependent branching ratios of the SM H. The reactions considered in this work are:",

Therefore, three final states are searched for with two, three, or four leptons (plus missing energy and multiple jets), which allow any of the mentioned production modes to be probed. The production of a new X scalar (1.2) would be seen as a local excess in the reconstructed di-Higgs mass spectrum. It is assumed in this work that m X > 2m H such that both H are produced on their mass shell. In the other extended Higgs sector model (1.3) X \u2192 SS is assumed to be the dominant X decay mode. In this scenario, the W W ( * ) W W ( * ) channel is the dominant decay mode for the mass ranges 270 GeV < m X < 2m t and 135 GeV < m S < m X /2, where m t , m X and m S are the mass of the top quark, X, and S scalars, respectively. The mass range m X > 2m t , where X \u2192 tt is expected to dominate, is not considered. It is assumed that m S > 135 GeV such that S \u2192 W W ( * ) is the dominant decay mode. It is also assumed that m S < m X /2 such that both S bosons are produced on their mass shell.",

Events are required to have N jets \u2265 2 and E miss T > 10 (30) GeV for the two (three) lepton channel. In order to suppress backgrounds containing a Z boson in the same-sign ee channel (due to the misidentification of an electron's charge) and in the three lepton channel, events are removed if they contained a same-flavour lepton pair with an invariant mass, m , near the Z boson mass: |m \u2212 m Z | < 10 GeV. In order to reduce the backgrounds from non-prompt leptons, the leading (subleading) lepton is required to have p T > 30 (20) GeV in the two lepton channel. The two leptons with the same charge are both required to have p T > 20 GeV in the three lepton channel. For non-resonant production and resonant production with m X > 300 GeV, signal events tend to have jets with larger p T compared to low m X resonant production scenarios and thus N jets \u2265 3 is required in the two lepton channel to account for more jets passing the p T requirement. Additionally, events containing a same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pair with an invariant mass m < 15 GeV are also removed in order to suppress backgrounds from hadron resonances or virtual photons. Following this preselection, a number of observables are considered and four variables are chosen based on the ranking of the generic algorithm [57] and the correlations betweeen variables. These four variables that consist of the angular separation between each lepton and the nearest jet as well as invariant masses among different combinations of the leptons and jets are used for further selection. The final selections on these variables are optimised in order to maximise signal significance. One of these variables is the invariant mass of two (three) leptons in the two (three) lepton channel and is shown in figure 1a (1b) to illustrate its discriminating power. The optimisation procedure using all four variables is performed separately for each analysis channel, each signal mass point, each lepton flavour category (for the two lepton channel), and each number of same-flavour opposite-sign (N SFOS ) lepton pairs (for the three lepton channel). The optimised selection criteria are listed in tables 3-9 in the appendix. Events in the four lepton channel are required to have exactly four leptons with i\u2208 q i = 0. At least one of the leptons is required to have p T > 22 GeV. Events that contain a SFOS lepton pair with m < 4 GeV are removed. Following this preselection, selections on the invariant masses and angular separation of lepton pairs are implemented to reject backgrounds containing a Z boson or non-prompt leptons or other objects incorrectly identified as leptons, known as fake leptons. A summary of the selection criteria used in the four lepton channel is shown in tables 10-11 in the appendix. Figure 1c shows the kinematic distribution of the four lepton invariant mass.",

Fake-lepton and nonprompt-lepton contributions from misidentification of hadronic jets as leptons, semileptonic decay of heavy-flavour hadrons and photon conversions from neutral pion decays are estimated using data with a fake-factor method [59]. The method defines \"tight\" leptons as leptons passing all requirements described in section 3 and \"anti-tight\" leptons as leptons failing the isolation or identification requirements. The fake factor is calculated as the ratio of events with tight leptons to events with one tight lepton replaced by an anti-tight lepton in the data control samples. The control samples of the two and three lepton channels are ensured to be largely orthogonal to corresponding preselection samples by requiring a lower jet multiplicity. A control sample containing three leptons with enriched Z+jets processes is used in the four lepton channel to extract the fake factors. All simulated prompt-lepton contributions are subtracted from the data before measuring the fake factor. The fakelepton background contributions are estimated by applying the fake factors to events with the same selection as for the signal regions but with at least one anti-tight lepton replacing one of the prompt leptons. The fake factors in the four lepton channel are applied to events in two control samples, one with three tight leptons and one anti-tight lepton and the other with two tight leptons and two anti-tight leptons.",

They include uncertainties related to the electron and jet energy measurements [51], muon momentum measurement, E miss T modelling [55], and lepton reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies. The dominant systematic uncertainty in the fake-lepton background estimations arises from a closure test of the fake-factor method and the relative contributions from heavy-flavour hadron decays and photon conversions. Pileup modelling, b-tagging efficiencies, and jet pileup rejection modelling are also included. Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated for all simulated samples. These include uncertainties in PDF, QCD scale, and parton shower modelling that impact efficiency times acceptance for signal samples and uncertainties in the production cross-sections for simulated background samples. The statistical uncertainties in MC signal and background samples as well as in data control regions are included as systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties with the largest impact on the HH production crosssection (times branching ratio) limits come from the jet energy scale and resolution with a relative impact compared to the total systematic plus statistical uncertainty of 45% (29%-55%) and fake-lepton background estimations with a relative impact of 42% (31%-54%) for the non-resonant (resonant) production searches. Theoretical uncertainties are found to have a relative impact of 23% (24%-36%) for the non-resonant (resonant) production searches. The relative impact of jet energy measurements, fake-lepton background estimations, and theoretical uncertainties in the X \u2192 SS analysis are 38%-51%, 37%-52% and 25%-32%, respectively. Other experimental uncertainties due to lepton, pileup, b-tagging, pileup jet rejection, prompt-lepton background estimations, and E miss T modelling are found to have a small impact on the results. The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is 2.1%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [26], and using the LUCID-2 detector for the baseline luminosity measurements [60], from calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans. It has a 5%-10% relative impact due to its simultaneous effect on the signal and background estimates. All simulated processes except ZZ are affected by the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement. The relative impact of all systematic uncertainties is found to be 71% (60%-79%) for the non-resonant (resonant) production searches. In addition to the systematic effects, the statistical uncertainties are found to have a relative impact of 71% (61%-80%) for the non-resonant (resonant) production searches.",
