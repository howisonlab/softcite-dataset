            "text": "The prediction of new heavy quarks is a common feature of many theories of physics beyond the standard model (SM). In composite Higgs models [1][2][3], heavy partners of the SM top quark solve the hierarchy problem caused by quadratic divergences in the quantum-loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass by providing contributions that offset those due to the SM top quark. Often in such models, new color-triplet partners are predicted, with one of them having an exotic electric charge of 5/3 times the charge of the positron, referred to as X 5/3 . In partially composite scenarios [4], these exotically charged fermions need not contribute to the gluon-gluon fusion production mode of the Higgs boson [5] and hence such measurements set no constraints on the mass of the X 5/3 particle. This paper describes -1 - a search for such a fermionic top quark partner, using proton-proton (pp) collision data collected during 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .",

            "text": "The dominant mechanism for X 5/3 production, shown in figure 1, is via quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes, which yield particle-antiparticle pairs, since the X 5/3 carries color charge. The X 5/3 particle can also be singly produced via electroweak processes, but that production mode is model dependent and is not considered here. Since the pair production involves exclusively the SM QCD coupling, the tree-level cross section is independent of the X 5/3 properties, other than its mass. The X 5/3 particle is assumed to decay into a top quark and a W boson with a branching fraction of 100%, since this is the dominant decay mode in many models [6]. The decay can occur through either righthanded (RH) or left-handed (LH) couplings to W bosons, and this search presents results for either fully RH or fully LH decays. Thus we have not restricted the interpretation of the results to the case of vector-like quarks, whose left-handed and right-handed chirality states have the same transformation properties under the weak isospin SU(2) gauge group, although limits obtained with this assumption would be very similar to those set for pure-LH or pure-RH couplings. This search focuses on two different final states consisting of either exactly one lepton or multiple leptons with the requirement that there be a pair of same-sign leptons. In both cases, additional hadronic activity in the event is required. Throughout the paper, the word lepton refers to an electron or a muon. Although leptonic tau decays are not specifically targeted in this analysis, their contribution to the signal efficiency is taken into account. The same-sign dilepton final state relies on its relatively clean signature and the large amount of jet activity from the other X 5/3 particle in the event to discriminate against background processes. The single-lepton channel exploits the shape of the distribution of the visible mass of the top quark reconstructed in the detector to discriminate against background events.",

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [15]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to less than 1 kHz before data storage.",

The SSP background consists of SM processes that give prompt, same-sign dilepton signatures, where a prompt lepton is defined as one originating from the direct decay of either a W or Z boson. The contribution of these processes to the signal region is estimated using simulation. The ChargeMisID background is composed of events that contain two opposite-sign leptons, but have the charge of one lepton mismeasured. This contribution is estimated from data. The Nonprompt background consists of events that contain at least one nonprompt lepton passing the lepton selection criteria.

The same-sign lepton pair that maximizes the scalar p T sum of its constituents is taken as the signal pair. Because the same-sign dilepton final state sample was collected in two different triggering eras, different p T requirements are placed on the pair according to the triggering era in order to ensure that the trigger has reached full efficiency. For the early (late) triggering era, the leading lepton is required to have p T > 40 40GeV while the subleading lepton is required to have p T > 35 (30) GeV.A set of preselection requirements is defined as follows. First, the invariant mass of the same-sign lepton pair is required to be greater than 20 GeV (quarkonia veto) and the event is required to contain at least two AK4 jets passing the requirements outlined above. Second, events containing a Z boson are removed by vetoing any event with an oppositesign, same-flavor pair of leptons having an invariant mass within 15 GeV of the mass of the Z boson. For the dielectron channel, this requirement is extended to the pair of same-sign electrons as well, in order to veto ChargeMisID background events.

For electrons, the probability of charge misidentification is measured using observed DY events by requiring a pair of electrons with an invariant mass (driven by ECAL information) between 81 and 111 GeV. The charge misidentification probability is binned by |\u03b7| of the electron, and split into three different p T regions: below 100 GeV, between 100 and 200 GeV, and above 200 GeV. These regions capture the effects of the differences in charge consistency requirements for low-and high-p T electrons, as well as any remaining inherent dependence of the charge misidentification probability on the electron p T . Values of the charge misidentification probability range from 10 \u22124 for low-p T electrons in the central part of the detector to a few percent for high-p T electrons in the forward region of the detector.",

For the same-sign dilepton final state, the uncertainty in the lepton triggering efficiency is 3% while for the single-lepton final state it ranges between 2 and 5%. In both final states, this uncertainty is applied per event. The JES and JER uncertainties are estimated by varying the relevant parameters up and down by one standard deviation (s.d.) and repeating the analysis selections. The pileup uncertainty is assessed by varying the total inelastic cross section (\u03c3 inel. ) used in the pileup reweighting by \u00b14.6% [57]. The uncertainty in the theoretical cross section from renormalization and factorization energy scales is estimated by independently varying the scales up and down by a factor of two and taking the maximum variation as the uncertainty.

The distributions in each category have variable-size bins, chosen so that the statistical uncertainty in the total background in each bin is less than 30%. The lower panel in each plot shows the difference between the observed and the predicted numbers of events in that bin divided by the total uncertainty. The total uncertainty is calculated as the sum in quadrature of the statistical uncertainty in the observed measurement and the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the background-only fit to data.",
