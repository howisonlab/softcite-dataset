The charmed mesons have been reconstructed in the range of transverse momentum 3.5 < p T (D) < 100 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7(D)| < 2.1. The differential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity were measured for D * \u00b1 and D \u00b1 production. The next-to-leading-order QCD predictions are consistent with the data in the visible kinematic region within the large theoretical uncertainties. Using the visible D cross sections and an extrapolation to the full kinematic phase space, the strangeness-suppression factor in charm fragmentation, the fraction of charged non-strange D mesons produced in a vector state, and the total cross section of charm production at \u221a s = 7 TeV were derived.",

Associated production of D mesons and W bosons has been also studied by the ATLAS Collaboration [4]. Production of D mesons in the hadronisation of charm quarks has been studied by the ALICE Collaboration in the central rapidity range (|y| < 0.5) [5,6] and by the LHCb Collaboration at forward rapidities (2.0 < y < 4.5) [7].

The MBTS are mounted at each end of the inner detector in front of the liquid-argon end-cap calorimeter cryostats at z = \u00b13.56 m and are segmented into eight sectors in azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity (2.09 < |\u03b7| < 2.82 and 2.82 < |\u03b7| < 3.84). The MBTS trigger used in this analysis is configured to require at least one hit above threshold. The second minimum-bias trigger uses the inner detector at the second-level trigger to select inelastic events on randomly chosen bunch crossings (Random). For D mesons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV (high-p T range), the first-level calorimeter-based jet triggers are used. The jet triggers use coarse detector information to identify areas in the calorimeter with energy deposits above certain thresholds. A simplified jet-finding algorithm based on a sliding window of configurable size is used to trigger events. The algorithm uses towers with a granularity of \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03b7 = 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 as inputs. In this paper, the first-level jet triggers with energy thresholds of 5, 10 and 15 GeV are used. No further jet selection requirements are applied at the second and third trigger levels. The integrated luminosity is calculated by measuring interaction rates using several ATLAS devices at small angles to the beam direction, with the absolute calibration obtained from beamseparation scans. The uncertainty of the luminosity measurement for the event sample used in this analysis is estimated to be 3.5% [10].",

In the massive scheme, the heavy quark Q appears only in the final state and the m 2 Q /p 2 T,Q power terms of the perturbative series are correctly accounted for, where p T,Q is the transverse momentum of the heavy quark and m Q is its pole mass. The massive-scheme calculations are not reliable for p T,Q m Q due to neglected terms of the type ln(p 2 T,Q /m 2 Q ). In the massless scheme, the heavy quark occurs as an initial-state parton and the large logarithmic terms are absorbed into the heavy-quark contribution to the proton PDF, and into the fragmentation functions of the heavyquark transition to a hadron. The massless calculations are reliable only for p T,Q m Q due to the assumption that m Q = 0. The FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations were developed to obtain reliable predictions for p T,Q \u2248 m Q . In FONLL, the massive and massless predictions are matched exactly up to O(\u03b1 3 s ), and spurious higher-order terms with potentially unphysical behaviour are damped using a weighting function. The FONLL parton cross sections are convolved with non-perturbative fragmentation functions. GM-VFNS combines the massless predictions with the massive m 2 Q /p 2 T,Q power terms and derives subtraction terms by comparing the massive and massless cross sections in the limit m Q \u2192 0. The large logarithmic terms in GM-VFNS remain absorbed in the PDF and in perturbatively evolved fragmentation functions with a nonperturbative input. Unlike other calculations, GM-VFNS considers fragmentation to D mesons from light quarks and gluons in addition to the heavy-quark fragmentation [29].",

The crossing angle of the colliding protons was either zero or negligible in the rapidity range of the measurement. To measure D mesons with p T < 20 GeV, the events collected with the minimum-bias MBTS and Random triggers are used; these triggers are unbiased for the events of interest [9]. However, the rate from the triggers exceeded the allotted trigger bandwidth after the initial data-taking period and thus prescale factors were applied to reduce the output rate. Taking into account the prescale factors, the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 nb \u22121 . To measure D mesons in the intervals 20 < p T < 30 GeV, 30 < p T < 40 GeV and 40 < p T < 100 GeV, the first-level jet triggers with energy thresholds of 5, 10 and 15 GeV, respectively, are used. The trigger efficiencies for the corresponding D meson p T ranges are above 90%. The efficiencies are derived from the MC simulation. The simulation uncertainties are estimated from data-MC comparisons using independent trigger selections with softer thresholds on the jet energy or energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The triggers with energy thresholds of 5 and 10 GeV were prescaled during some parts of the data-taking period; their corresponding integrated luminosities are 28 nb \u22121 and 90 nb \u22121 , respectively. The data sample taken with the unprescaled jet trigger with the energy threshold of 15 GeV corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 280 nb \u22121 .",

The systematic uncertainty fractions corresponding to the tracking (\u03b4 2 ) uncertainties ( are consistent with the data within the large theoretical uncertainties, with the central values of the predictions lying below the measurements. The GM-VFNS predictions agree with data. The differential cross sections d\u03c3/dp T and d\u03c3/d|\u03b7| for D * \u00b1 and D \u00b1 production are shown in Tables 4-6 and compared in Figs. 4-6 with the NLO QCD predictions. The FONLL, MC@NLO and POWHEG predictions are generally below the data. They are consistent with the data in the measured p T (D) and |\u03b7(D)| ranges within the large theoretical uncertainties. The FONLL and POWHEG predictions reproduce shapes of the data distributions. The p T shape of the MC@NLO prediction is harder than that for the data. The |\u03b7| shape of the MC@NLO prediction in the high-p T range differs from the data and all other predictions. The GM-VFNS predictions agree with data in both shape and normalisation. ",

            "text": "Reconstruction of D + s mesonsThe D + s mesons are reconstructed from the decay D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + with \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 . In each event, tracks from particles with opposite charges and p T > 1 GeV are assigned the kaon mass and combined in pairs to form \u03c6 candidates. Any additional track with p T > 1 GeV is assigned the pion mass and combined with the \u03c6 candidate to form a D + s candidate. Only three-track combinations successfully fitted to a common vertex are kept. The \u03c6 candidate invariant mass, m(KK), and the D + s candidate invariant mass, m(KK\u03c0), are calculated using the track momenta refitted to the common vertex. To suppress combinatorial background the following requirements are used:\u2022 \u03c7 2 < 12, where \u03c7 2 is the D + s candidate vertex fit quality. \u2022 |d 0 (D + s )| < 0.15 mm. \u2022 |z 0 (D + s ) sin \u03b8(D + s )| < 0.3 mm. \u2022 L xy (D + s ) > 0.4 mm. \u2022 \u22120.8 < cos \u03b8 * (\u03c0) < 0.7, where \u03b8 * (\u03c0)is the angle between the pion in the KK\u03c0 rest frame and the KK\u03c0 line of flight in the laboratory frame.\u2022 | cos 3 \u03b8 (K)| > 0.2,where \u03b8 (K) is the angle between either of the kaons and the pion in the KK rest frame. The decay of the pseudoscalar D + s meson to the \u03c6 (vector) plus \u03c0 + (pseudoscalar) final state results in an alignment of the spin of the \u03c6 meson transverse to the direction of motion of the \u03c6 relative to the D + s . Consequently, the distribution of cos \u03b8 (K) follows a cos 2 \u03b8 (K) shape, implying a uniform distribution for cos 3 \u03b8 (K). In contrast, the cos \u03b8 (K) distribution of the combinatorial background is uniform and its cos 3 \u03b8 (K) distribution peaks at zero. The requirement suppresses the background significantly while reducing the signal by 20%. Small contributions, affecting mass ranges outside the expected D + s signal, from the decays D + s \u2192 \u03c6K + , D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , D + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + are subtracted using the simulated reflection shapes normalised to the measured D + and D + s rates. Fig. 3 shows the m(KK\u03c0) distributions for low-p T and high-p T D + s candidates with m(KK) within \u00b17 MeV of the world average \u03c6 mass [47]. Sizeable signals are seen around the world average value of the D + s mass, 1968.30 \u00b1 0.11 MeV [47]. Smaller signals are visible around the world average value of m(D + ), as expected from the decay D + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + with \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 . The m(KK\u03c0) distributions are fitted to the sum of two modified Gaussian functions describing the D + s and D + signals and a quadratic exponential function describing the non-resonant background. For the small D + signals, the signal positions are fixed to the D + s signal positions minus the world average value of m(D + s ) \u2212 m(D + ) [47], and their widths are fixed using the D + s signal widths and the MC ratio of the D + and D + s widths. The fitted D \u00b1 s yields are N(D \u00b1 s ) = 313 \u00b1 60 (stat) and N(D \u00b1 s ) = 158 \u00b1 25 (stat) for the low-p T and high-p T ranges, respectively. The combined D + s mass value is 1971.2 \u00b1 2.0 (stat) MeV, in agreement with the world average. The widths of the signals are \u223c15 MeV, in agreement with the MC expectations.",
