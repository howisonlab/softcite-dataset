It is necessary to measure reactor neutrino disappearance with precision 1% or better to detect finite value of \u03b8 13 . This requirement is the most strict compared to other reactor neutrino experiments performed so far. The Double Chooz experiment makes use of a number of techniques to reduce the possible errors to achieve the sensitivity. The detector is now under construction and it is expected to take first neutrino data in 2009 and to measure sin 2 2\u03b8 13 with a sensitivity of 0.03 (90%C.L.) In this proceedings, the technical concepts of Double Chooz detector are explained stressing on how it copes with the systematic errors.",

            "text": "In DoubleChooz experiment, two neutrino detectors of identical structure are placed undergrounds of near (L~400m) and far (L~1,050m) locations from the reactors. The near detector measures the neutrino flux and spectrum with high statistics while the effect of neutrino oscillation is small. The far detector looks for the deficit of event rate and the distortion of the energy spectrum with respect to the spectrum measured by the near detector. With this way, most of the systematic uncertainties associated with neutrino flux and spectrum and detector efficiencies are cancelled out [4]. Because the residual systematic uncertainties come in from the differences of the responses of the two neutrino detectors, the detectors were very carefully designed to reduce possible difference. Fig.-1 shows the DC detector. The main detector components are, from inner to outer, (1) \u03bd-target, (2) \u03b3-catcher, (3) Buffer oil & Photo multiplier tubes (PMTs), (4) Inner muon veto & PMTs, (5) Outer muon veto and (6) Calibration system. (1) is made of 0.1% Gadolinium loaded liquid scintillator with volume 10.3m 3 . This scintillator was newly developed by stressing a long term stability in mind. In order to accurately know the near/far ratio of the number of target protons, the liquid scintillator for both near and far detectors will be formulated in the same batch and the mass of the introduced scintillator will be measured by same precise weighing scale. (2) is Gd unloaded liquid scintillator, which has same light output and same specific density as (1). This layer is used to catch the g-rays which escape from the n-target region and to reconstruct original energy of the positron signal and the Gd signal to reduce the systematic error associated with the event selections. (3) is non-scintillating paraffin oil. This layer is used to shield \u03b3-rays and neutrons from PMTs and outside. There are 390 10\" diameter low background PMT arrays in the buffer oil. Low background PMTs are essential because they dominate the \u03b3-ray backgrounds whose energy is around the oscillation dip in the energy spectrum of neutrinos. ",

There is no geometrical fiducial cut, which usually introduces large systematic uncertainty. Instead, the fiducial is defined by the existence of the Gd signal, which corresponds to the precisely measured \u03bd-target mass. Although there is neutron spill-in/out effect, it is same for both the near and far detector. Since there are only a small number of events at the energy criteria, the efficiencies of (i) and (ii) cuts are insensitive to the error of the energy calibration. Since the timing can be determined with a precision of ~ns, the uncertainty of the cut (iii) is also very small.",

The Chooz experiment started data taking before the operation of Chooz reactors and successfully took reactor-OFF data. Based on MC simulation calibrated by the reactor-OFF data, the background of the DC detector, which has improved shields, is known to be very small. This is an unique feature compared with other reactor\u03b8 13 experiments. The S/N of the near detector is better than far detector and background is also negligible. With all these treatments, the systematic uncertainty of 0.6% or better is expected for the accuracy of deficit measurement. The Chooz power station has two large PWR reactor cores of 4.2GW, each emits \u20ac ~10 21 \u03bd e s isotropically. The far detector can take 40,000 \u20ac \u03bd e events and the near detector can take 500,000 \u20ac \u03bd e events in 3 years, which corresponds to statistic error of 0.5%.
