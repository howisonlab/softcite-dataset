The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, produced at the CERN LHC. No excess of events is observed beyond expectations from standard model processes. The result of the search is interpreted in the context of a general model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, where the charged and neutral winos are the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles. Within this model, winos with a mass up to 360 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. Two simplified models inspired by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking are also examined, and used to derive upper limits on the production cross sections of specific supersymmetric processes.",

The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [5][6][7] provides a calculable framework with a fully known particle content, introducing a superpartner for each SM particle. For example, squarks, gluinos, and gravitinos are the SUSY partners of quarks, gluons, and gravitons, respectively. The MSSM has guided the search program for physics beyond the SM at facilities such as the Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC. Existing searches have not yet found evidence for SUSY, but a large parameter space of the MSSM remains to be explored.",

            "text": "Within the MSSM, scenarios based on gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] are of particular interest because of their ability to naturally circumvent the so-called SUSY flavour problem [19]. The framework of general gauge mediation (GGM) [20] offers a clear definition of GMSB and establishes its key aspects. For example, GMSB predicts the gravitino ( G) to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The combination of this feature and the weakness of the coupling of G to other MSSM particles E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. has specific consequences in collider phenomenology. Under the assumption that R-parity [6] is conserved, SUSY particles are pairproduced at the LHC. Except for direct LSP pair production, each SUSY particle initiates a decay chain that yields the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Branching fraction for the SUSY particle decay involving G is negligible except for the NLSP, leaving the decay of the NLSP to its SM partner and the G as effectively the only gravitino production mechanism. The gravitino escapes detection, leading to missing momentum in the event. The signature of a GMSB signal is thus strongly dependent on the identity of the NLSP. In most GMSB models, the NLSP is taken to be a bino-or wino-like lightest neutralino, where a bino and wino are the superpartners of the SM U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields, respectively. Previous searches for a GMSB signal typically exploited the diphoton signature [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29], in which each of the two bino-like neutralinos decays promptly into a photon and a gravitino. Similar scenarios with nonprompt NLSP decays have also been considered [30,31]. Thus far, no evidence for GMSB SUSY has been observed, resulting in upper limits on the production cross sections given as a function of the SUSY particle masses, the NLSP lifetime, or other model parameters.",

Although the lifetime of the NLSP is effectively a free parameter in GGM phenomenology, a prompt decay of winos is assumed in this analysis. A signature of at least one photon (\u03b3 ), one electron or muon ( ), and large missing transverse momentum ( p miss T ) is used in this search. The photon is assumed to be emitted by a neutralino NLSP, and the leptons by either a charged or neutral NLSP decaying to a W or Z boson, respectively. This signature suppresses many SM backgrounds, obviating the need for additional requirements such as associated jet activity. The diagrams in Fig. 1 provide examples of the decay chains studied in this analysis. The present search is sensitive to the direct electroweakino production mode of Fig. 1(a), where the winos are produced without involving coloured SUSY particles, but also to strong production modes such as the gluino ( g) pair-production process shown in Fig. 1(b). Similar searches were conducted by the ATLAS [33] and CMS [34,35]  analyses sees an excess of events over the respective SM predictions. The wino co-NLSP model has also been probed through the signatures of three leptons or two leptons and two jets [37,38], which target the decay of the neutralino NLSP to a gravitino and a Z boson rather than to a gravitino and a photon. None of these analyses observed a significant excess of events over their respective SM predictions.",

Only photons from clusters in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.44 are included in this analysis. These clusters were selected as photon candidates by a set of criteria that are designed to achieve a 90% identification efficiency for true photons. For a cluster to be identified as a photon, its shape must be consistent with that expected from a photon, and the en-ergy detected in the HCAL behind the cluster cannot exceed 5% of the ECAL energy. To further suppress the misidentification of hadrons as photons, a PF-based isolation requirement is imposed. is also based on the PF objects. All reconstructed PF candidates are clustered into jets using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [46,47], with a distance parameter of 0.5. Jet objects are used to calculate the H T variable, defined as the scalar p T sum of jets. To be considered in the H T sum, a jet must have a calibrated and pileup-corrected [48] p T value greater than 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and be consistent with an origin at the primary vertex [49]. In addition, it must be no closer than R = 0.5 to the photon or lepton candidates. The missing momentum p miss T is given by the negative of the vector p T sum of all PF objects, with jet-energy corrections applied. The magnitude of p miss T is referred to as E miss T .",

The dominant background processes in this category are Drell-Yan dielectron (qq \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and W (\u2192 \u03bd) + jets production, in which an electron or jet, respectively, is misidentified as a photon. Minor contributions arise from tt events with leptonic top quark decays, for both the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 channels. Events with tt production also contribute to the background if a jet is misidentified as a photon. An electron can be misidentified as a photon if it fails to register track seeds due to detector inefficiencies such as non-operational sensors in the tracker. A jet can be misidentified as a photon if a large fraction of its energy is carried by mesons decaying to photons, such as \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 . These two types of background are estimated from data using weighted control samples. The method proceeds in two steps. First, a control sample enriched in particles that are prone to be misidentified as photon candidates, i.e., electrons or neutral hadrons, is selected by inverting certain criteria in the photon identification, while keeping the other selection requirements identical to those for signal candidates. This control sample is called the proxy sample. The second step is to determine the transfer factor N misid /N proxy , where N misid is the estimate of the number of misidentified events in the signal candidate sample and N proxy is the number of events in the proxy sample. The proxy sample is then scaled by the transfer factor. The definition of the proxy sample is tuned to make its kinematic properties similar to those of events with misidentified photons. Thus, this two-step procedure takes the set of misidentified events in a control region where the SUSY signal contribution is expected to be negligible, e.g. in events with small E miss T , and utilizes it to model the distribution of the misidentified background for a given kinematic variable. In particular, from the extrapolation of the observed events in the control region, the method predicts an expectation for the number of events and corresponding kinematic distribution in the signal region. A detailed validation of this background estimation is performed by applying the method to Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples, and comparing the outcome of this procedure to the known generated MC content. Good agreement is found in all such tests.",

The proxy sample for events with a jet-to-photon misidentification is constructed by inverting the requirements on the variable describing the ECAL cluster shape (\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 in Ref. [41]) and on one of the isolation variables in the photon selection. The transfer factor for the hadronic-proxy sample is determined through an assessment of the fraction of events with jet-to-photon misidentification among the photon candidates. This fraction is denoted as the \"hadron fraction\". This measurement is performed in a low-E miss T control sample from a fit to the distribution of \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 based on two templates, one representing pure photons and one modelling the events with jet-to-photon misidentification. The fit is performed with photon candidates in muon-photon events, where a very small contamination of misidentified electrons is expected in the photon sample. The pure photon template is obtained from Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 data by tagging two muons and requiring the three-body \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 invariant mass to be consistent with the Z boson mass. The template that models events with jet-to-photon misidentification is obtained by inverting the isolation requirement on the signal-photon candidates. The hadron fraction is measured in p T bins of the photon candidate and decreases, in general, as a function of p T . In the e\u03b3 channel, its value varies from 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 at p T = 40 GeV to 0.08 \u00b1 0.02 at p T = 120 GeV. In the \u03bc\u03b3 channel, the corresponding values are 0.30 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.09 \u00b1 0.02. The uncertainties are dominantly due to possible mismodelling of the fit templates. The small difference in the hadron fraction of the photon candidates between the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 channels originates from small differences in trigger requirements on the photon object between the diphoton and muon-photon triggers used to select the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 data sets.",

A misidentified lepton is defined as a reconstructed lepton that does not arise directly from W or Z boson decays, nor from \u03c4 decays that originate from a W or Z boson. Misidentified-lepton events arise primarily from the decay of heavy-flavour quarks and from hadrons misidentified as leptons, with other sources such as decays-in-flight constituting a much smaller contribution. Events where both the lepton and photon are misidentified, which constitute up to 30% of the total misidentified-photon background, are already accounted for by the procedure described in Section 4.1. The SM electroweak background is dominated by events with V\u03b3 (V = W, Z) production. In particular, W\u03b3 events have the same signature as signal events: an energetic photon, a lepton, and significant E miss T . The EWK background includes rare multiboson events and events with tt\u03b3 production, which we collectively refer to as the \"rare EWK\" background.

This is accomplished through a two-component template fit describing the V\u03b3 and misidentified-lepton backgrounds. The templates originate from two background samples obtained using the event selection criteria for the V\u03b3 MC sample and for the misidentified-lepton proxy sample. = 40 GeV is applied to reduce the contribution of Z\u03b3 events. Expected contributions from the misidentified-photon background and rare EWK backgrounds are subtracted from the data distribution before the fit. The fit provides scale factors for the template histograms that are used directly as transfer factors for the V\u03b3 and the misidentified-lepton proxy samples. Besides avoiding a reliance on the value of the theoretical V\u03b3 cross section, which is observed to underestimate the measured production rate of W\u03b3 events [57,58], this method has the benefit that it does not double count the contributions of background events with both a misidentified photon and lepton. This class of events is already accounted for in the misidentified-photon background sample, as mentioned above. Fig. 2 shows the results of the template fit, which is performed in the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 channels independently. The resulting scale factors for the V\u03b3 background in the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 channels are 1.59 \u00b1 0.27 and 1.47 \u00b1 0.16, respectively, which are similar to each other as expected. The uncertainties in the scale factors are estimated through toy MC studies repeating the fit after changing the contributions of the subtracted misidentified-photon and rare EWK components by their uncertainties. Table 2 summarizes the sources of systematic uncertainty for the background predictions and the signal yields. For each source, the size of the uncertainty is given (in percentage) relative to the number of events in the corresponding background or signal sample. For the background, the size of the uncertainty relative to the total number of background events is also shown. If the relative uncertainties differ significantly among background sam- Table 2 Summary of systematic uncertainties. The third column gives the uncertainty relative to the number of events in the corresponding background or signal sample. The fourth column shows, for the background terms, the uncertainty relative to the total number of background events in the signal region. ples because of statistical fluctuations due to the limited number of events available for the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties, the range from the minimum to the maximum relative uncertainty is shown. The dominant experimental uncertainty for the background prediction is due to the normalization scale factors applied to the rare EWK and V\u03b3 samples. For the rare EWK sample, a 50% uncertainty is assigned as a conservative approximation of the uncertainty in the NLO-to-LO cross section ratio of tt\u03b3 production, which is the dominant component in this sample. Also, for the rare EWK sample, we evaluate the uncertainty due to the luminosity determination [59]. Normalization uncertainties in the background estimates of events with misidentified photons or leptons are absorbed in the uncertainty of the V\u03b3 scale factor through the uncertainty estimation in the \u03c6( , p miss T ) template fit described above. Subdominant systematic uncertainties arise from potential mismodelling of the shapes of the V\u03b3 and proxy samples for misidentified photons and leptons. For simulation-based background estimates, differences with respect to the data in the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER) are considered as systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty associated with the JES is evaluated by varying the scale by \u00b11\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the half-width of the 68% confidence interval around the nominal value, and recalculating the E miss T , M T , and H T values in the V\u03b3 and rare EWK samples, and similarly for the JER term. The shift in the expected event yield in the signal region is taken as the estimate of the systematic uncertainty. Table 2 also lists the systematic uncertainties considered for the signal MC samples that are used for the interpretation of the result of this search. The uncertainties due to the JES and JER are evaluated using the procedure described above. In addition, for the signal samples, uncertainties in the description of initial-state radiation as well as the renormalization scale and PDF [60] are considered.  [200,300], and >300 GeV, respectively). The data are found to be consistent with the background prediction in all regions. Thus no significant excess of events beyond the SM expectation is observed.",

All SUSY particles except for the gluino and winos are considered in the limit of very large mass values such that they do not participate in the interactions. In this limit, the lightest chargino and neutralino become purely wino-like. There is no restriction on the decays, but the gluino always undergoes at least a three-body decay and the charged wino decays to a W boson and the gravitino. The neutral wino decays to a gravitino and either a photon or a Z boson, with branching fractions dictated by the weak mixing angle and the wino mass. In the generated scans, the gluino mass (M g ) ranges from 715 to 1415 GeV in 50 GeV steps, and the wino mass (M W ) from 205 GeV to [M g \u2212 10 GeV], also in 50 GeV steps.",

The cross section for each mass point is determined to NLO accuracy in quantum chromodynamics using the prospino 2.1 [67] program. This cross section result, along with its uncertainty, is used to derive 95% CL exclusion limits on the SUSY particle masses. In this inclusive GMSB model, electroweak production will always take place when the wino is light, independent of the gluino mass. Thus the exclusion curve becomes horizontal for M W \u2248 360 GeV. Note that for this and for all other instances in this paper where a numerical result is quoted for a mass limit, the result is based on the theoretical prediction for the cross section minus its 1\u03c3 uncertainty. The expected distributions for signal in Fig. 3 correspond to the GMSB model for the mass point (M g , M W ) = (915, 405) GeV.

            "text": "The two simplified models considered are denoted the TChiWg and T5Wg models. The TChiWg model is initiated by the direct production of hypothetical particles \u03c7 \u00b1 and \u03c7 0 , whose decays are restricted to W \u00b1 G and \u03b3 G, respectively. The gravitino G is nearly massless as in GMSB models. Thus, this model can be identified with electroweak production in the GMSB wino co-NLSP model, depicted by the diagram in Fig. 1(a), differing only in the decay branching fractions. The particles \u03c7 \u00b1 and \u03c7 0 are therefore identified with gauginos in the remainder of this paper. A mass range of 100 \u2264 M \u03c7 \u2264 800 GeV is considered, where M \u03c7 is the degenerate mass of the gauginos. The generation of events for the T5Wg model, corresponding to the diagram in Fig. 1(b), starts with the pair production of gluinos. The two gluinos undergo three-body decays g \u2192 qq \u03c7 \u00b1 and g \u2192 qq \u03c7 0 , followed by the decays of the \u03c7 \u00b1 and \u03c7 0 as discussed above. The T5Wg samples are gener- Events for both models are generated with the MadGraph 5 1.3 program, with up to two final-state partons in addition to the hard interaction. The events are then interfaced to pythia 6.4, which is used to describe the SUSY decay chains and parton showers. The neutralino-chargino and the gluino pair production cross sections are calculated to NLO and NLO + NLL (next-to-leading logarithm) accuracy [60], respectively, and used to derive 95% exclusion limits. Fig. 6(a) shows the computed 95% CL cross section upper limit for the TChiWg model as a function of M \u03c7 , together with the theoretical cross section. Assuming a 100% branching fraction for \u03c7 0 \u2192 \u03b3 G, the mass range 100 < M \u03c7 < 540 GeV is excluded, where the lower limit corresponds to the lowest M \u03c7 included in the scan. Assuming a more physically motivated branching fraction through a rescaling of the theoretical cross section by the weak mixing angle, the exclusion range is 100 < M \u03c7 < 340 GeV. The latter result is similar to the limit M W < 360 GeV obtained from the GMSB model with a wino-like NLSP. The production cross section of the T5Wg model is determined solely by M g . Nevertheless, the M g \u2212 M \u03c7 mass difference affects the H T and E miss T spectra, resulting in nontrivial exclusion-limit contours in the M \u03c7 -M g plane. The 95% CL cross section upper limits and exclusion contours for the T5Wg model are shown in Fig. 6(b). For M \u03c7 > 200 GeV, pair production of gluinos is excluded for gluino masses below 1 TeV. For 500 < M \u03c7 < 700 GeV, gluinos below approximately 1.1 TeV are excluded.",
