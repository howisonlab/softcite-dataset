The observation of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and with properties consistent with the SM expectations [1][2][3] completed the SM. However, in the absence of enormous orderdependent cancellations, also known as fine-tuning, large SM quantum corrections would shift the bare Higgs boson mass to values far beyond the electroweak scale. New physics is required to stabilize the Higgs boson mass naturally at the electroweak scale, i.e. without invoking fine-tuning.",

We observe that in the W+jets simulated sample, the number of events at large jet p T distributions is overestimated as compared with the distributions measured in data. We derive a correction for the W+jets simulation as a function of the H T variable, defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets with p T > 30 GeV. The data to simulation ratio of the H T distribution is well described by a 2-parameter linear fit with a negative slope. A correction to the modeling of the W+jets H T spectrum is made using the results of the fit. After the correction is applied, good agreement in the modeling of all kinematic variables is observed. Distributions of S T and the invariant mass of the bW system in the W+jets sample are shown in Fig. 3.",

            "text": "Good agreement between the event yields in the data and in the SM prediction is observed within uncertainties, as shown in Table 2. The sum of the SM backgrounds and a hypothesized signal for the combined electron and muon channels is fitted to the observed spectrum of M inv . The fit uses a binned likelihood method, where the binning of the distributions is chosen in such a way that the statistical uncertainty in the MC estimation of total background per bin is always less than 20%. Contributions from the SM processes are allowed to float independently within their systematic uncertainties, using log-normal priors [53,54]. The nuisance parameters describing the shape uncertainties are constrained using Gaussian priors. The shapes of the M inv distributions for backgrounds and signal are parametrized and varied according to the  nuisance parameters. The post-fit M inv distribution, with the shape and background normalizations corresponding to the maximum likelihood values, is presented in Fig. 4. All corrections derived from the background-enriched regions are propagated to the signal region and appropriate systematic uncertainties are assigned. Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross section of the Y/T \u2192 bW process are computed using a Bayesian approach [55], where the likelihood is marginalized with respect to the nuisance parameters representing systematic uncertainties. The expected limit is calculated by resampling the data from the background distribution. The 95% CL expected and observed upper limits are listed in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 5. The observed limits at high VLQ mass reflect a 2\u03c3 deficit of events above 1.0 TeV in the M inv distribution. The limits are derived assuming a narrow width for the VLQ. The VLQ width is proportional to the square of the coupling, and is negligible compared to the experimental resolution for couplings below 0.5, for the range of VLQ masses considered in this paper. In the framework of the model considered, Y quarks with a coupling of 0.5 and B(Y \u2192 bW) = 100% are excluded in the mass range from 0.85 to 1.40 TeV. This result may be compared with the expected region of excluded masses, which extends up to 1.0 TeV. In the case of T quarks with a coupling of 0.5, the theoretical cross section, the selection efficiency and the M inv distribution are the same as those for the production and decay of Y quarks, but the expected decay branching fraction B(T \u2192 bW) is 50%, only half that expected for B(Y \u2192 bW). Thus mass exclusion limits similar to those achieved for the Y quark would only be obtained for B(T \u2192 bW) = 100%.",

The mass of the vector-like quark is reconstructed by forming the invariant mass of the leading btagged jet, electron or muon, and missing transverse momentum in the event, and a fit to the invariant mass spectrum is performed. No evidence of an excess due to new physics is observed. Upper limits at 95% CL are set on the cross sections for single production of vector-like Y and T quarks in the mass range from 0.70 to 1.80 TeV. In the framework of the model considered, Y quarks with a coupling of 0.5 and B(Y \u2192 bW) = 100% are excluded in the mass range from 0.85 to 1.40 TeV. This result may be compared with the expected region of excluded masses, which extends up to 1.0 TeV.
