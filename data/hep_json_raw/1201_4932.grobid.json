The data are compared to LO predictions from pythia, herwig++ and alpgen event generators. The data are also compared to NLO parton shower prediction from POWHEG, when interfaced to pythia or herwig parton shower, and all order resummation prediction from HEJ. In most of the phase-space regions presented, the experimental uncertainty is much smaller than the spread of LO Monte Carlo event generator predictions. In general, powheg+pythia gave the best description of the data.",

            "text": "In this measurement, the QCD activity, or the absence of additional jet activity in dijet production is studied using a jet veto. Diverse perturbative QCD effects between widely separated jets can be investigated, the veto scale being much larger than \u039b QCD . First, BFKL-like dynamics are expected to become increasingly important for large rapidity intervals [1,2]. Alternatively, the effects of wide-angle soft-gluon radiation can be studied in the limit that the average dijet transverse momentum is much larger than the scale used to veto on additional jet activity [3]. Finally, colour singlet exchange is expected to be important if both limits are satisfied at the same time, i.e the jets are widely separated and the jet veto scale is small in comparison to the dijet transverse momentum. This work aims at measuring and comparing the effects of QCD radiation to standard event generators in those regions of phase space explored for the first time [4]. This jet veto measurement is also very useful to constrain the theoretical modelling in the current search for Higgs production via vector boson fusion and future precision Higgs measurements [5].",

Jets are required to have transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and rapidity |y| < 4.4. The dijet system is identified using two di fferent selection criteria. In the first, the dijet system is made of the two highest transverse momentum jets in the event, which probes wide-angle soft gluon radiation in p T -ordered jet configurations. In the second, the most forward and the most backward jets in the a e-mail: pauline.bernat@cern.ch event are used, which favours BFKL-like dynamics because the dijet invariant mass is much larger than the transverse momentum of the jets. For both definitions, the mean transverse momentum of the jets that define the dijet system, p T , is required to be greater than 50 GeV. The variable used to quantify the amount of additional radiation in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system is the gap fraction. This is the fraction of events with no additional jet with a transverse momentum greater than a given veto scale, Q 0 , in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system 1 . By default, Q 0 = 20 GeV. The measurements are fully corrected for experimental effects. The final distributions therefore correspond to the 'hadron-level', in which the jets are reconstructed using all final state particles that have a proper lifetime longer than 10 ps.",

The systematic uncertainty on the detector correction was determined considering both the physics modelling uncertainty, accounting for any deviation between data and Monte Carlo (MC) and JES uncertainty impact on shapes, and the detector modelling uncertainty, estimated by varying the jet reconstruction efficiency and the jet energy resolution within the allowed uncertainties as determined from the data, and reweighting the z-vertex distribution. The total systematic uncertainty in the detector correction was defined as the quadrature sum of the physics/detector modelling uncertainties and the statistical uncertainty of the pythia samples.

            "text": "A central jet veto was used to study the fraction of events that do not contain hadronic activity in the rapidity interval bounded by a dijet system (gap fraction). Data were compared to diverse LO Monte Carlo event generators and NLO predictions at large rapidity difference and mean transverse momentum of the jets. In most of the phase-space regions presented, the experimental uncertainty is smaller than the theoretical uncertainty. Furthermore, the experimental uncertainty is much smaller than the spread of LO predictions. This measurement of the QCD radiation between widely separated jets can be used to constrain the Monte Carlo simulations for measurements that are sensitive to higher order QCD emissions. The dijet system is defined as the most forward and the most backward jets in the event. In (a) the veto scale is set to the default value (20 GeV) while in (b) it is set to Q 0 = p T . The data are compared to the hej and powheg predictions. The data and theory are presented in the same way as Fig. 2.",
