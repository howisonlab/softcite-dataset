New limits on this decay channel from recent LHC data have been used to claim that these limits restrict the SUSY parameter space even more than the direct searches. However, direct searches are hardly dependent on tan \u03b2, while Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is proportional to tan 6 \u03b2. The relic density constraint requires large tan \u03b2 in a large region of the parameter space, which can lead to large values of B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Nevertheless, the experimental upper limit on Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is not constraining the parameter space of the CMSSM more than the direct searches and the present Higgs limits, if combined with the relic density. We also observe SUSY parameter regions with negative interferences, where the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 value is up to a factor three below the SM expectation, even at large values of tan \u03b2.",

            "text": "Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC), like the leptonic decays of neutral B-mesons, are strongly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM), since they can only occur via loops involving the weak bosons. These decays are helicity suppressed, so the amplitudes are proportional to the mass of final state particles and the highest rates will be into tau leptons. The experimental signature for leptonic decays is clear: search for an invariant mass in the mass window of the B-meson. This is easier for muonic decays. Hence, muonic B-decays have been investigated in much more detail at hadron colliders, especially since these decays can be strongly enhanced by loop corrections involving particles beyond the SM, like Supersymmetry [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay mode has received significant attention [7][8][9] after the CDF collaboration announced a measurement a factor five to six above the expected SM value [10]. However, the excess was not confirmed by subsequent LHC measurements [11], but Figure 1: Annihilation diagrams for the lightest neutralino, which is a linear combination of the gaugino and Higgsino states:",

However, the excluded parameter space depends strongly on the choice of tan \u03b2 since the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 rate varies as tan 6 \u03b2. The relic density constraint correlates tan \u03b2 with the SUSY mass parameters [13], so if one combines the cosmological constraint with the accelerator constraints there is no arbitrary choice for tan \u03b2 anymore. Although the relic density requires a large value of tan \u03b2 in a large region of parameter space, we show that the excluded SUSY mass ranges are well below the LHC constraints from direct searches [14][15][16][17] and the limits on the pseudo-scalar Higgs [18,19]. In principle, other constraints, like g-2, b \u2192 s\u03b3 and B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd could also be considered. However taking these into account requires a careful treatment of the non-gaussian systematic errors. which is beyond the scope of the present letter. Numerous studies combining these variables with the recent LHC data have appeared [20][21][22].",

These are the regions, where the Next-to-Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (NLSP) and LSP are nearly mass-degenerate. In this case they co-exist in the early universe until the common freeze-out temperature and can co-annihilate. This happens if the stau and neutralino are degenerate and coannihilate into a tau [35]. For this to happen the values of m 0 and m 1/2 have to be fine-tuned to a high degree, so it happens only in a thin stripe in the m 0 \u2212 m 1/2 plane, as will be shown below. Another coannihilation region happens at the border of parameter space, where electroweak symmetry breaking does not occur anymore, since here the Higgs mixing parameter becomes negative. In the transition region \u00b5 becomes small and the lightest chargino and lightest neutralino become nearly degenerate Higgsinos, as is obvious from the mass matrices, which have as lowest eigenvalues either a gaugino mass term or a Higgsino mass term, if the mixing is neglected. In this case gauginos can co-annihilate into a W-boson [36].",

Such a high cross section can be obtained only close to the resonance, i.e. m A \u2248 2m \u03c7 . Actually on the resonance the cross section is too high, so one needs to be in the tail of the resonance, i.e. m A \u2248 2.2m \u03c7 or m A \u2248 1.  [18]. Also the excluded region from the direct searches has been indicated using the CMS data [16]. Similar results were obtained by other searches [14,15,17]. The relic density constraint can be fulfilled with the parameters of Fig. 2, as demonstrated in the left panel of Fig. 3. The top left is excluded, since here the LSP is not a neutral particle, but the stau is the LSP. In the co-annihilation regions the annihilation via the pseudo-scalar Higgs exchange has to be suppressed, thus requiring a larger value of m A and a corresponding lower value of tan \u03b2, as demonstrated in the right panel of Fig. 3. It is just a more detailed plot of the right hand panel of Fig. 2 for two values of m 1/2 . In summary, if one allows tan \u03b2 to vary in the m 0 \u2212 m 1/2 plane, one obtains the observed relic density for any combination of m 0 and m 1/2 , i.e. the relic density allows all masses for the SUSY sparticles. However, the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 constraint has to be investigated for the large values of tan \u03b2 required by the relic density.  ",

One observes that the limit from Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is well below the limits from the direct and Higgs searches shown in Fig. 2. The reason for the two-lobed excluded regions is the following: at small values of m 0 the trilinear coupling cannot be made large enough to suppress Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) enough, because the staus become tachyonic. At intermediate values of m 0 the trilinear couplings can be made large enough, but at larger values of m 0 the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass m A becomes too large for large A 0 values (see Fig. 8 right) and the relic density becomes too large as well. For values of m 0 well above 1 TeV the loop contributions are suppressed enough to fulfill the Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) constraint. These results are demonstrated in Fig. 8, which displays the values of Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and the pseudoscalar Higgs mass in the A 0 -tan \u03b2 plane for m 0 = 1000 and m 1/2 = 250 GeV, i.e. in the excluded lobe on the right hand side in Fig. 7. The green region in the left pannel of Fig. 8 corresponds to values close to the SM value for Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), but at large positive values of A 0 and large values of tan \u03b2 the Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) value drops below the SM value (blue upper right region), while at lower values of A 0 one observes the famous large tan \u03b2 enhancement (red bottom right region). In the right top corner the staus become tachyonic, so this theoretically disfavored region is left white. Surprisingly, values of Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) can fall up to a factor three below the SM value, which can be explained as follows. In Eq. 4 sin(2\u03b8t) can change sign, depending on the value of the off-diagonal element in the stop mixing matrix A t \u2212 \u00b5/ tan \u03b2. Hence, C P can change sign as well and the term (",

The latter requires large tan \u03b2 values in the regions outside the co-annihilation regions and since Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is proportional to tan 6 \u03b2 one could expect strong constraints from the recent upper limits. However, the Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) approaches zero in case the splitting between the stop1 and stop2 masses approaches zero. This splitting is determined by the off-diagonal element A t \u2212 \u00b5/ tan \u03b2 of the stop mixing matrix, which can be made small for large tan \u03b2 and a positive value of the trilinear coupling A 0 at the GUT scale. From a simultaneous fit of A 0 and tan \u03b2 to the combined data of Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and relic density we find the excluded regions from these constraints to be well below the constraints from the Higgs searches and direct searches at the LHC. This holds even in the case that a hypothetical limit on Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) of two times the SM value would be obtained. It is also shown that at large values of both, tan \u03b2 and the trilinear coupling, negative interferences can lead to Br(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) values a factor three below the SM value, so even if values below the SM are found experimentally, this does not exclude supersymmetry, but constrains the parameter space.",

The production cross section of the pseudo-scalar Higgs at the LHC is proportional to tan 2 \u03b2, so the present limits from LHC are proportional to tan \u03b2 2 as well. At tan \u03b2=50 the present limit on m A is about 450 GeV, so the limit on m 1/2 is close to it.
