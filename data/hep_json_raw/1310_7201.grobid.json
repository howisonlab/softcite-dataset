The parameter A \u0393 is the asymmetry of the effective lifetimes measured in decays of D 0 andD 0 mesons to the CP eigenstates K \u2212 K \u00fe and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe .

The results represent the world's best measurements of these quantities. They show no difference in A \u0393 between the two final states and no indication of CP violation.",

CP violation was subsequently discovered in the B 0 and B 0 s systems [2][3][4]. Charmed mesons form the only neutral meson-antimeson system in which CP violation has yet to be observed unambiguously. This system is the only one in which mesons of up-type quarks participate in matter-antimatter transitions, a loop-level process in the standard model (SM). This charm mixing process has recently been observed for the first time unambiguously in single measurements [5][6][7]. The theoretical calculation of charm mixing and CP violation is challenging for the charm quark [8][9][10][11][12]. Significant enhancement of mixing or CP violation would be an indication of physics beyond the SM.",

Here, effective lifetimes refer to lifetimes measured using a single-exponential model in a specific decay mode. Currently available measurements of A \u0393 [15,16] are in agreement with no CP violation at the per mille level [13]. This Letter reports measurements of A \u0393 in the CP-even final states K \u2212 K \u00fe and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe using 1.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy at the LHC recorded with the LHCb detector in 2011. In the SM, the phase \u03d5 is final-state independent and thus measurements in the two final states are expected to yield the same results. At the level of precision of the measurements presented here, differences due to direct CP violation are negligible. However, contributions to \u03d5 from physics beyond the SM may lead to different results. Even small final-state differences in the phase \u0394\u03d5 can lead to measurable effects in the observables of the order of x\u0394\u03d5, for sufficiently small phases \u03d5 in both final states [17]. In addition, the measurements of A \u0393 in both final states are important to quantify the contribution of indirect CP violation to the observable \u0394A CP , which measures the difference in decaytime integrated CP asymmetry of [18,19].",

The signal peaks in m\u00f0hh\u00de and \u0394m are described by the sum of three Gaussian functions. For the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe final state a power-law tail is added to the m\u00f0hh\u00de distribution to describe the radiative tail [23]. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function in m\u00f0hh\u00de and a threshold function in \u0394m.",

As this cannot be guaranteed to cancel, a systematic uncertainty is assigned. The unbinned method is not affected by this as it is not sensitive to the overall normalization of the D 0 andD 0 samples. In general, the two methods are subject to different sets of systematic effects due to the different ways in which they extract the results. The systematic uncertainties for the binned method are larger due to the fact that the fits are performed independently in each decaytime bin. This can lead to instabilities in the behavior of particular fit components with time, an effect which is minimized in the unbinned fit. The effects of such instabilities are determined by running simulated pseudoexperiments.",

The result for the K \u2212 K \u00fe final state is obtained based on an independent data set to the previous LHCb measurement [15], with which it agrees well. The results show no significant difference between the two final states and both results are in agreement with zero, thus indicating the absence of indirect CP violation at this level of precision.",
