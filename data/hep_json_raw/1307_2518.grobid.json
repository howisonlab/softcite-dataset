These models include axigluons, colorons, diquarks, excited quarks, Randall-Sundrum gravitons, string resonances, and Z' models, among others. Other models make the prediction that high-p T jets will be suppressed, resulting in jet extinction. Using the data collected in 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, the CMS collaboration has made a baseline inclusive jet cross section measurement for comparison with new-physics searches, and then performed searches for jet extinction and resonances that decay to two hadronic jets. The results of these searches will be presented. No evidence of new physics has been observed, and these results set new limits on the parameters of these models.",

The measurement uses six, staggered triggers to cover a p T range from 74-2500 GeV and a range of parton momentum fraction x from 0.019-0.625. The data are corrected for detector smearing effects and jet energy resolution. The dominant systematic uncertainty for data comes from the jet energy scale and ranges from 15-40%.

However, nonperturbative processes could produce black holes that decay to a high multiplicity of low-energy jets [23]. Such black hole decays might be difficult to distinguish from the low-energy SM background, but their effect on the jetp T spectrum would be dramatic. At a certain energy scale, black holes would dominate and thereby suppress the production of high-p T jets, causing jet extinction at the high end of the jet-p T spectrum.",
