We set upper limits at the 95% C.L. on the product of production cross section and branching ratio for a scalar resonance decaying into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pairs, and we interpret these limits as limits on the production of Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and as constraints in the MSSM parameter space.",

Additional backgrounds include tt and SM diboson production. The backgrounds from Z+jets, W +jets, and tt production are modeled using alpgen [12], with parton showering and hadronization provided by pythia. The alpgengenerated samples make use of the MLM [13] jet-parton matching scheme to improve the jet multiplicity modeling. Diboson processes (WW, WZ, ZZ) are simulated using pythia. In all cases tauola [14] is used to model the tau lepton decays. Simulated events are then processed by a geant-based [15] simulation of the D0 detector, and data events from random beam crossings are overlaid to model detector noise and multiple pp interactions. Higher order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations of cross sections are used to normalize the simulated background samples, except for the background from multijet production, for which the normalization and differential distributions are derived from data.",

Several sources of systematic uncertainty affect both the signal efficiency and background estimation. Both uncertainties that modify only the normalization and uncertainties that change the shape of the M vis distribution are taken into account.

Uncertainties arising from modeling of the Z boson transverse momentum and the \u03c4 h energy scales modify the shape of the M vis distribution. The M vis distribution is used to calculate upper limits on the cross section based on a modified frequentist method with a log-likelihood ratio test statistics [18] and a profiling technique to reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties [19]. The value of CL s , is calculated as CL s = CL s+b /CL b , where CL s+b and CL b are the p-values under signal+background and background-only hypotheses, respectively. The expected and observed limits are calculated by scaling the signal until 1 \u2212 CL s reaches 0.95. The combined limits on the product of production cross section and branching ratio into tau lepton pairs are given in Fig. 2 and Table II as a function of M \u03c6 . The combined limits assume a scalar resonance with the decay width of a SM Higgs boson, which is negligible compared to the experimental resolution on M vis . In addition to M A and tan \u03b2, the masses and couplings of the Higgs bosons in the MSSM depend on additional parameters through radiative corrections. The production cross section limits are therefore translated into exclusions in the tan\u03b2 versus M A plane for two representative MSSM scenarios assuming a CP-conserving Higgs sector [20], the m max h scenario [21] and the no-mixing scenario [22] with a Higgs mass parameter \u00b5 = +200 GeV. The signal cross sections and branching ratios are calculated using the feynhiggs [23] program, where the gg \u2192 \u03c6 production cross section is taken from [24] and the bb \u2192 \u03c6 production cross section from [25].",

In the (M A , tan \u03b2) region where this analysis sets 95% C.L. limits, and for \u00b5 = +200 GeV, the Higgs boson width is smaller than 0.1M \u03c6 and less than half of the experimental resolution on M vis . The signal cross section in this channel is largely insensitive to sign(\u00b5). The ratio of the gg \u2192 \u03c6 and bb \u2192 \u03c6 cross sections also depends on tan \u03b2. For this inclusive search, the difference between the efficiencies of the two production mechanisms is small and can be neglected.",
