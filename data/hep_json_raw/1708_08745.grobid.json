            "text": "An invariant differential cross section measurement of inclusive \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson production at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV was carried out by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The spectra of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons were measured in transverse momentum ranges of 0.3 < p T < 35 GeV/c and 0.5 < p T < 35 GeV/c, respectively. Next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations using fragmentation functions DSS14 for the \u03c0 0 and AESSS for the \u03b7 overestimate the cross sections of both neutral mesons, although such calculations agree with the measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio within uncertainties. The results were also compared with PYTHIA 8.2 predictions for which the Monash 2013 tune yields the best agreement with the measured neutral meson spectra. The measurements confirm a universal behavior of the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio seen for NA27, PHENIX and ALICE data for pp collisions from \u221a s = 27.5 GeV to \u221a s = 8 TeV within experimental uncertainties. A relation between the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 production cross sections for pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV is given by m T scaling for p T > 3.5 GeV/c. However, a deviation from this empirical scaling rule is observed for transverse momenta below p T < 3.5 GeV/c in the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio with a significance of 6.2\u03c3 .",

            "text": "Measuring identified particle production in proton-proton (pp) collisions over wide kinematic ranges is considered an informative probe of strong interactions at high energies. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction [1]. It succeeds in providing a qualitative description of a wide range of phenomena in hadronic collisions. At typical hadron collider energies its perturbative expansion (pQCD) permits a detailed quantitative comparison with experimental data. However, it remains a challenge to provide a consistent description of hadron spectra at all collision energies reached experimentally. In theoretical models, particle production is usually divided into e-mail: alice-publications@cern.ch two categories: the \"soft\" scattering regime describing particle production involving small momentum transfers and the \"hard\" scattering regime, responsible for producing particles with momenta of several GeV/c or more.",

            "text": "Only \"hard\" scattering processes with a sufficiently large transverse momentum transfer, Q 2 , can be calculated using methods based on pQCD. High-momentum particles originate from the fragmentation of partons produced in scattering processes with large Q 2 . The theoretical description of a \"hard\" scattering process can be factorized into parton distribution functions (PDFs), the QCD matrix element and fragmentation functions (FFs). PDFs describe the fraction of the proton's longitudinal momentum carried by a scattered parton, x, and FFs describe the ratio of the observed hadron momentum to the final-state parton momentum, z, respectively. Comprehensive parametrizations of PDFs and FFs are derived from global fits to the experimental data at various collision energies. The energies reached at the LHC [2] open up the domains in x and z not accessible at lower energy. In the past, experiments at the LHC consequently found discrepancies between the measured \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson spectra [3][4][5] and pQCD calculations based on fragmentation functions, which include mostly data from experiments below the TeV scale [6]. Since the gluon contribution becomes more dominant with increased center of mass energy, \u221a s [7], \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson spectra at LHC energies provide new constraints on the gluon to light-flavor hadron fragmentation functions. Recent progress in comprehensive global QCD analysis of parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order (NLO) [8] derived from inclusive pion production in semi-inclusive electronpositron annihilation, deep-inelastic scattering and pp collisions over a wide energy range, including the LHC results [3], achieves a good and consistent description of pion spectra, including the latest measurements of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [9] and 7 TeV [3]. One of the conclusions of that analysis was that meson production from gluon fragmentation is reduced, which turns out to be at tension with previously available data obtained at RHIC [10].",

Section 3 describes the datasets, the event selection and also introduces the calorimeter triggers used in this analysis. In Sect. 4, the reconstruction principles for neutral mesons are introduced.

These electron-positron pairs, originating at secondary vertices (V 0 ), are reconstructed by the main tracking systems in ALICE centered at mid-rapidity and consisting of the inner tracking system (ITS) [26] and the TPC [25]. The aforementioned detectors are described below, noting the detector configurations during pp data taking at \u221a s = 8 TeV in 2012.",

The relative energy calibration of the detector is performed by measuring, in each cell, the reconstructed \u03c0 0 mass in the invariant mass distribution of photon pairs built with one photon in the given cell. The achieved calibration level is estimated to be 3% and adds up quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution.",

Charged tracks originating from the primary vertex can be reconstructed down to p T \u2248 100 MeV/c and charged secondaries down to p T \u2248 50 MeV/c [22]. The TPC provides particle identification via the measurement of energy loss, dE/dx, with a resolution of \u2248 5% [25]. Beyond the outer radius of the TPC, the transition radiation detector (TRD) and the time-of-flight detector (TOF) provide additional particle identification information, as well as allowing for improved momentum resolution and added triggering capability. The detectors represent most of the material between the TPC and the EMCal and hence dominate the material budget in front of the EMCal.

The MB trigger is a hardware Level-0 (L0) trigger [29]. It requires at least one hit in each V0A and V0C [28]. Both calorimeters also provide L0 triggers: EMC-L0 [30] and PHOS-L0 [31].

The ratios are expected to follow a constant for high cluster energies, the so-called plateau region, assuming the triggers only enhance the rate of clusters but do not affect their reconstruction efficiency. To reduce the statistical uncertainties, the R Fs are always determined with respect to the next lower threshold trigger. The cluster energy ratios have a steep turn-on near the respective trigger threshold energies. Since the EMC-L0 trigger becomes fully efficient only above its triggering threshold of E EMC-L0 \u2248 2 GeV, there is a change of slope visible in the turn-on region of the EMC-L1 trigger. The turn-on curve of the PHOS-L0 trigger also changes its slope due to a non-uniformity of the channels hardware gains. However, only the R F plateau regions are mainly relevant for analysis, as they are needed to correctly normalize the triggered data, which are found to be: R F EMC-L0 = 67.0 \u00b1 1.1, R F PHOS-L0 = (12.4 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10 3 and R F EMC-L1 = (14.9 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 3 . The last factor is obtained by multiplying the two given rejection factors of the two EMCal triggers, see Fig. 1, as the R F for EMC-L1 to MB trigger is of interest.",

The neutral mesons are reconstructed using the two electromagnetic calorimeters, EMCal and PHOS, a photon conversion method (PCM) and a hybrid method, PCM-EMCal, which combines one photon candidate from the PCM and one from the EMCal, resulting in four (three) different methods for the reconstruction of \u03c0 0 (\u03b7) mesons. The reconstruction of \u03b7 mesons is not accessible by PHOS due to the limited detector acceptance and, compared to the \u03c0 0 , the wider opening angle of the decay photons. The hybrid PCM-EMCal method benefits from the high momentum resolution of the PCM, a high reconstruction efficiency and, crucially, the triggering capabilities of the EMCal. Moreover, an extended p T coverage is achieved compared to the standalone EMCal measurement, as there is no limitation due to cluster merging effects, discussed later in this section. Photons and electrons/positrons generate electromagnetic showers when they enter an electromagnetic calorimeter. They usually spread their energy over multiple adjacent calorimeter cells. In order to reconstruct the full energy of impinging particles, those adjacent cells need to be grouped into clusters, which is realized by a clusterization algorithm. In the first step, the algorithm looks for the cell that recorded the highest energy in the event, exceeding the seed energy, E seed . After the identification of such a seed cell, adjacent cells with recorded energies above a minimum energy, E min , are added to the cluster. For the EMCal, the clusterization algorithm adds cells to the cluster as long as their recorded Table 1 The analyzed luminosities considering the individual statistics for the different reconstruction methods and triggers.

After the cell-bycell energy calibration of the EMCal [23,27], an improved correction for the relative energy scale as well as for the residual geometrical misalignment of the EMCal between data and MC simulations is derived by making use of the good momentum resolution of the PCM photon in the hybrid PCM-EMCal method. Using this method, the \u03c0 0 mass is evaluated as a function of EMCal cluster energy, E cluster , for data and MC. Therefrom, a cluster energy correction is deduced for the simulation, for which the reconstructed \u03c0 0 masses are adjusted to the measured mass positions in data. For E cluster \u2248 1 GeV, the correction is of the order of 2% and rises up to 4% for higher energies. Thus, a precise energy calibration scheme for the relevant energy regions is available which is found to be consistent for the EMCal and hybrid PCM-EMCal methods for \u03c0 0 as well as \u03b7 mesons at the same time, hence demonstrating the validity of the procedure. After applying this calibration in the analysis, the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mass values in data and MC are obtained for each p T bin and their ratio is computed. Then, the ratios are plotted versus p T and fitted with a constant, giving access to the residual miscalibration of the meson mass values between data and MC. Such residual offsets of 0.005 \u00b1 0.043 and 0.14 \u00b1 0.13% are found for \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons for the EMCal analysis, whereas 0.002 \u00b1 0.042 and 0.02 \u00b1 0.14% are obtained for PCM-EMCal, illustrating the performance of the calibration procedure. For the PHOS, the energy deposition in each cell is calibrated by adjusting the \u03c0 0 peak position in the invariant mass spectra of photon pairs to the true mass of the \u03c0 0 meson. The accuracy of this calibration procedure is estimated to be better than 1%. It is evaluated from a comparison of the \u03c0 0 peak width in calibrated data and MC simulations by introducing random, normal-distributed decalibration parameters to the MC simulation.",

For the photon reconstruction with PHOS, relatively loose identification cuts are applied because the shower overlap is negligible and the combinatorial background is found to be small in pp collisions. A minimum cluster energy, E cluster > 0.3 GeV, as well as a minimum number of cells forming a cluster, N cell \u2265 3, are required in order to reject electronic noise and minimum ionizing particles which deposit about 270 MeV in the PHOS. For the EMCal, a minimum energy cut of E cluster > 0.7 GeV is applied and the minimum number of cells grouped in a cluster is set to N cell \u2265 2. Furthermore, the selection criteria of |\u03b7| < 0.67 and 1.40 < \u03d5 < 3.15 rad are imposed for EMCal clusters. Pileup from multiple events, which may occur within a readout interval of the front-end electronics, is rejected by applying a cluster timing cut relative to the collision time of \u221225 < t cluster < 25 ns for the PHOS and \u2212 35 < t cluster < 25 ns for the EMCal. Thus, photon candidates from different bunch crossings are removed with high efficiency of > 99%. For the EMCal, all clusters matched with a primary charged track are rejected. This track matching procedure, referred to as general track matching, uses a track p T -dependent matching in \u03b7 and \u03d5, beginning from | \u03b7| < 0.04 and | \u03d5| < 0.09 for very low track momenta of p T < 0.5 GeV/c and going down to | \u03b7| < 0.01 and | \u03d5| < 0.015 for highest track momenta, using the p T -dependent matching conditions | \u03b7| < 0.01 + ( p T + 4.07) \u22122.5 and | \u03d5| < 0.015 + ( p T + 3.65) \u22122 . Applying these conditions, a primary track to cluster matching efficiency of more than 95% is obtained over the full p T range, rising above 98% for the analyzed EMCal triggered datasets for p T beyond 10 GeV/c. To further enhance the photon purity and to reject neutral hadrons, a cluster shape cut of 0.1 \u2264 \u03c3 2 long \u2264 0.7 is applied for EMCal clusters, where \u03c3 2 long stands for the smaller eigenvalue of the dispersion matrix of the shower shape ellipse defined by the responding cells and their energy contributions to the cluster [9,39]. The lower threshold of \u03c3 2 long is chosen to remove contamination caused by neutrons hitting the APDs of the readout electronics.",

The reconstruction of such photon conversion candidates using PCM may be divided into three major steps: (i) tracking of charged particles and secondary vertex (V 0 ) finding [37]; (ii) particle identification and (iii) photon candidate reconstruction and subsequent selection. The V 0 s used in this analysis are obtained during data reconstruction using all available tracking information, recalculating the momenta of the daughter tracks under the assumption that both daughters are created with parallel momentum vectors at the V 0 . The tracks associated with secondary vertices are required to have a minimum momentum of p track T > 50 MeV/c and at least 60% of clusters from the maximum possible number of clusters, that a particle track can create in the TPC along its path, need to be found. In order to reduce the contamination from Dalitz decays, conversion candidates are only considered with a vertex at a radial distance of at least R > 5 cm. In addition, a line-cut is applied to restrict the geometrical \u03b7 distribution of the V 0 s in order to remove photon candidates that would otherwise appear outside the angular dimensions of the detector. The condition R conv > |Z conv |S ZR \u2212 7 cm is applied with S ZR = tan (2 arctan(exp(\u2212\u03b7 cut ))) and \u03b7 cut = 0.9, where the coordinates R conv and Z conv are determined with respect to the nominal center of the detector. Additional constraints are imposed on R conv < 180 cm and |Z conv | < 240 cm to ensure that the reconstruction of secondary tracks is performed inside the TPC. Electrons and positrons from photon conversions are identified via their energy deposit, dE/dx, in the TPC. The difference of the measured dE/dx value from the hypothesis of the electron/positron energy loss is used for particle identification. The dE/dx of measured charged tracks is required to be within \u2212 3 < n\u03c3 e < 5 of the expected energy loss, which is a p T -dependent observable defined by n\u03c3 e = (dE/dx\u2212 dE/dx e )/\u03c3 e with the average energy loss of the electron/positron, dE/dx e , and the Gaussian width of the fit to the measured dE/dx distribution, \u03c3 e . To further reduce charged pion contamination as the pion dE/dxband begins to merge with the electron/positron dE/dx-band above p 4 GeV/c, a cut based on the separation from the hypothesis of charged pion energy loss is applied in n\u03c3 \u03c0 , analog to the previous definition. Tracks with energy losses closer to the pion line than |n\u03c3 \u03c0 | < 1 are removed, which is done up to 3.5 GeV/c. The non-photon V 0 can-didate contamination is further suppressed by a triangular two-dimensional cut, | pair | < pair,max (1 \u2212 \u03c7 2 red /\u03c7 2 red,max ), with \u03c7 2 red,max = 30 and pair,max = 0.1. This cut is based on the reduced \u03c7 2 of the Kalman-filter [40] hypothesis for the e + e \u2212 pair and on the angle pair between the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field of the ALICE magnet and the e + e \u2212 pair plane. Furthermore, a cut on the cosine of the pointing angle of cos(\u03b8 PA ) > 0.85 is performed, where the pointing angle, \u03b8 PA , is the angle between the reconstructed photon momentum vector and the vector joining the collision vertex. The remaining K 0 S , and contamination is removed by selecting q T < q T,max 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2 /\u03b1 2 max on the Armenteros-Podolanski plot [41] with q T,max = 0.05 GeV/c and \u03b1 max = 0.95. Additionally, the PCM measurement requires an out-of-bunch pileup correction which estimates the contamination of photon candidates from multiple events overlapping in the TPC. The correction is based on a study of the distance of closest approach (DCA) of the conversion photon candidates which is the smallest distance in beam direction, z, between the primary vertex and the momentum vector of the photon candidate. Photon candidates from different events generate a broad underlying Gaussian-like DCA distribution, which is fitted in order to estimate the outof-bunch pileup contribution. The correction is found to be p T -dependent and ranges from 42% at low p T \u2248 0.35 GeV/c to 10% at high p T \u2248 11 GeV/c.",

In context of the PCM, a wider cut of \u2212 4 < n\u03c3 e < 5 concerning the electron/positron energy loss hypothesis is used for the hybrid method and the p T restriction of the charged pion dE/dx cut is loosened. Only the upper value of the cut on the short axis of the moment of the shower shape for the EMCal is changed and required to be \u03c3 2 long \u2264 0.5 in order to further reject contamination of hadrons [9]. Due to the timing constraint of the EMCal restricting clusters to triggered bunch crossings, no DCA or additional out-of-bunch pileup rejection is needed for the hybrid method. In addition to the general matching of primary charged particles to EMCal clusters already described, a dedicated track matching procedure for the two charged V 0 daughters with respect to EMCal clusters is applied. This cluster-V 0 track matching is the most important ingredient for the hybrid analysis, as pairing one leg of the V 0 candidate with the EMCal cluster generated by one of these secondary charged tracks itself, leads to an auto-correlation and causes a broad peak between the masses of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons at around 300 MeV/c. The same parameters from the general track matching procedure are found to remove about 99% of such candidates.",

            "text": "Invariant mass distributions of photon pairs, shown in which have been subtracted from raw real events to obtain the signal displayed with red data points. The blue curves represent fits to the background-subtracted invariant mass spectra. Additional examples of invariant mass distributions for the different methods are given in Ref. [38] the neutral meson signal for photon candidate pairs from the same, real event. An opening angle cut of 17 mrad for the angle between the momentum vectors of the two paired photon candidates is applied for the EMCal measurement. Requiring a minimum separation between such pairs is needed to ensure a proper background description by event mixing, in which two clusters from different events might otherwise be separated by an arbitrarily small distance. In same events, such cluster configurations would overlap partially or even merge into single clusters, which has been explicitly considered for event mixing by not allowing the cells with largest deposited energies of respective clusters to be direct neighbors on the EMCal surface. For the PCM and hybrid PCM-EMCal methods, an opening angle cut of 5 mrad is further applied between the momentum vectors of the pair of conversion photon candidates and accordingly,    [38] the pair of PCM and EMCal photon candidates. Furthermore, pairs are restricted to a rapidity of |y| < 0.12 for the PHOS and |y| < 0.8 for all other methods. The uncorrelated combinatorial background is estimated by using an event mixing technique, in which photon candidates from different events are paired in order to prevent correlations between the candidates. Different event pools are used for this purpose, binned by primary vertex position, photon candidate multiplicity and transverse momentum to ensure the mixing of similar events only. In contrast to sameevent combinations to extract the neutral meson signal, the mixed-event background is obtained with up to 80 different events, stored in each of the event pools, in order to minimize its statistical uncertainties. Therefore, the mixed-event background needs to be scaled to match the integral of the raw signal in the vicinity of the right side of the neutral meson peak, just outside the peak integration interval, after which it is subtracted from the raw distribution. The backgroundsubtracted signal is then fitted to determine the mass peak position and width of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons for every p T bin. A function composed of a Gaussian modified by an exponential tail at the low mass side [42] is used for this purpose. The low mass tail accounts for late conversions of one or both photons for the EMCal method and for energy loss effects due to bremsstrahlung for the PCM and hybrid PCM-EMCal methods. To reflect the residual correlated background components which remain after the subtraction of the mixedevent background, the fitting is performed by including an additional first order polynomial function (deduced from MC simulations), which is also shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and which is further being subtracted from the invariant mass distribution. In contrast, a slightly different approach for the background description is followed for the PHOS as its limited acceptance results in a more complicated shape of the combinatorial background around the signal peak, especially at low p T . As both correlated and combinatorial backgrounds are influenced in the same manner, the ratio of the raw signal and mixed-event distributions is constructed and fitted with first or second order polynomial function outside the peak region. Then, the mixed-event distribution is scaled with the obtained polynomial function and subtracted from the raw signal, which can be followed in Fig. 2. A Crystal Ball function [43] is used as the main fit function for the PHOS method which also reproduces the tail at the low mass region to take into account the late conversion of photons in front of the calorimeter. The signal distribution is then obtained by subtracting the scaled mixed-event background from the raw invariant mass distribution. The resulting backgroundsubtracted signal distributions as well as raw signals from real events, the normalized mixed-event and residual background distributions are shown in Figs. 2, 3 and in Ref. [38] for the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson mass region, respectively, for given example p T bins, illustrating the meson reconstruction over the full reported p T range.",

PYTHIA8 [18] and PHOJET [44] event generators with minimum bias processes are used for this purpose. The correction factors for both MC productions are found to be consistent and, hence, are combined. To generate enough statistics for high meson momenta to be able to correct the raw yields obtained with triggered data, a PYTHIA8 simulation is used that is enriched with jets, generated in bins of hard scatterings, p T,hard . Particles generated by the event generators are propagated through the ALICE detector using GEANT3 [45] which realistically reproduces interactions between the particles and the detector material. In the simulation, the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis cuts are applied as for real data. In Fig. 4, the reconstructed \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mass peak positions and widths are compared as a function of p T between data and MC to confirm a proper detector response in the simulation. The normalized correction factors, , for each method, containing the specific detector acceptances as well as the full reconstruction efficiencies, are shown in Fig. 5. For the EMCal analysis, the correction factor for the \u03c0 0 is observed to decrease for p T 10 GeV/c. This is due to the effect of cluster merging, as due to the Lorentz boost the opening angles of \u03c0 0 mesons become too small to resolve adjacent clusters given the finite segmentation of the calorimeter. While the dominant symmetric decays are first to merge, the asymmetric decay contributions become more relevant at higher momenta. Above a certain limiting momentum, it is no longer possible to separate the two decay photons of the \u03c0 0 , creating merged clusters that significantly reduce the reconstruction efficiency in the EMCal as seen in Fig. 5. Thus, the natural upper limit for the \u03c0 0 reconstruction with the EMCal is of the order of p \u03c0 0 T \u2248 20 GeV/c. In contrast, the PCM-EMCal hybrid approach overcomes the limitations of the EMCal cell segmentation and makes it possible to reconstruct \u03c0 0 mesons up to p T \u2248 35 GeV/c as reported in this paper. For the PHOS, such cluster merging effects are negligible for the reported p T range owing to the high granularity of the calorimeter. Since the opening angles of photons from \u03b7 meson decays are much larger compared to the \u03c0 0 , merging effects are negligible for all approaches over the full reported p T range in this case.",

            "text": "For the \u03c0 0 measurement by PHOS, the systematic uncertainty related to the signal extraction is evaluated by varying the fitting range and the assumptions about the mass peak and background shapes. The systematic uncertainty related to the material budget is taken from Ref. [3], which is estimated by comparing the results of the analysis with and without magnetic field in the ALICE solenoid. Photons, which converted to e + e \u2212 pairs within the detector material, are most likely being reconstructed as two clusters in the presence of a magnetic field. Without a field, the secondary tracks from photon conversions are less separated and can be dominantly detected as single clusters, building the correct invariant masses for \u03c0 0 s in a di-cluster analysis. Therefore, comparing the \u03c0 0 spectra from data and MC with nominal and zero magnetic fields is a straightforward method to evaluate the uncertainty of the material budget description in simulations. Systematic uncertainties due to the cluster energy calibration are decomposed into the uncertainty of the energy scale of clusters and non-linearity effects. The energy scale Table 2 Summary of relative systematic uncertainties in percent for selected p T bins for the reconstruction of \u03c0 0 mesons. The statistical uncertainties are given in addition to the total systematic uncertainties for each bin. Moreover, the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are also listed, obtained by applying the BLUE method [49][50][51][52][53] for all reconstruction methods available in the given p T bin, considering the uncertainty correlations for the different methods (see Sect. 6 for further details). The uncertainty from \u03c3 MBAND determination of 2.6%, see Ref. [35], is independent from the reported measurements and is separately indicated in the following plots below p T interval 1.  uncertainty of 0.1% is estimated from a comparison of the \u03c0 0 mass peak position for the two-photon invariant mass spectra in data and MC. This energy uncertainty is translated to an uncertainty of the \u03c0 0 yield by convolution with the shape of the p T spectrum. The systematic uncertainty due to the non-linearity correction is evaluated by introducing different non-linearity correction schemes and calibration parameters for the MC simulation, whereas the p T dependence of the \u03c0 0 peak position and width is always kept consistent with data. The efficiency uncertainty consists of acceptance variations and differences between MC event generators. The acceptance uncertainty is estimated by changing the good cluster selection criteria, and the MC generator-dependent uncertainty is evaluated by comparing efficiencies of MB MC generators and single particle MC simulation which generates events containing single neutral mesons with realistic transverse momentum and rapidity distributions. Moreover, it includes the trigger efficiency uncertainty for the high energy photon trigger analysis, which is estimated by comparing the trigger turn-on curve from data with MC simulations. \"Trigger normalization & pileup\" summarizes systematic uncertainties due to the trigger normalization factor and pileup effects. The uncertainty related to the trigger normalization factor is estimated by changing the range of the fit to determine the rejection factor (R F). Furthermore, the out-of-bunch pileup contribution is evaluated by varying the timing cut to accept clusters. For the PCM measurement, the main source of systematic uncertainty is the material budget, for which the same value is used as previously calculated in Ref. [3]. The signal extraction uncertainty is estimated by changing the integration window around the invariant mass peak, the normalization range of the mixed-event background and by using different order polynomials as well as other fit functions to evaluate the remaining background contribution. \"Track reconstruction\" summarizes the systematic uncertainties found by requiring different numbers of TPC clusters and by applying different minimum transverse momentum cuts on tracks. The systematic uncertainties due to the electron identification (\"electron PID\" and \"PCM photon PID\") are determined by varying the PID cuts, which are elaborated in Sect. 4, and by comparing the respective results. For PCM, the \"trigger normalization & pileup\" uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the DCAz background description for the out-of-bunch pileup estimation. Furthermore, it contains the systematic uncertainty due to the pileup rejection by the SPD due to its finite efficiency to remove pileup events.",

The uncertainty is assessed by running the analysis only with/without TRD modules in front of the EMCal, since part of the data taking in 2012 occurred with the EMCal only partially obscured by the TRD. Since TRD and TOF have similar material budgets, the same uncertainty is assigned to the TOF as well, which covered the full polar angle so that a similar assessment as for the TRD is not feasible. Both uncertainties are quadratically combined to arrive at the given uncertainties which are listed in the tables. The signal extraction uncertainty contains the systematic uncertainties obtained from variations of the background normalization region, the choice of the background fit function and integration intervals, analog to the PCM method, as well as from variations of the minimum opening angle cut on the meson level. The systematic uncertainty denoted as \"cluster description\" reflects the mismatch of the description of the clusterization process between data and MC simulations, giving rise to modified reconstruction efficiencies, which includes the following cluster related quantities: minimum energy, shower shape, number of cells and timing as well as variations of the energy thresholds used for the clusterization process.",

The fit parameters extracted from both the TCM and Tsallis fits are summarized in Table 5. The TCM is chosen as the standard fit function, since it better describes the spectra at low and high p T than the Tsallis counterpart [38]. This is also reflected in the smaller values obtained for the reduced \u03c7 2 red of the respective fits, which are also recorded in Table 5. These values are calculated without assuming any correlation of systematic uncertainties and are found to be rather small for both fits, as the total uncertainties of meson spectra are used for their calculation. A direct comparison of TCM and Tsallis fits can be found in Fig. 7, where both fits are plotted, in addition to the measured spectra and theory calculations.",

            "text": "The measured invariant differential cross sections are compared with NLO pQCD calculations [8,11] using MSTW08 (PDF) [16] with DSS14 (FF) [8] for \u03c0 0 and CTEQ6M5 (PDF) [17] with AESSS (FF) [11] for the \u03b7 meson. The same factorization scale value, \u03bc, (0.5 p T < \u03bc < 2 p T ) is chosen for the factorization, renormalisation and fragmentation scales used in the NLO pQCD calculations. For the \u03c0 0 the NLO PDF, pQCD and FF combination describes the RHIC data rather well [57], whereas for \u221a s = 2.76 TeV pQCD overpredicts ALICE data by 30% at moderate p T and agrees at higher p T [9]. The ratios of data and NLO pQCD predictions to the TCM fits of neutral meson spectra are shown in Fig. 7. The largest uncertainty of the NLO pQCD calculation is due to the choice of \u03bc. For all \u03bc values, these calculations overestimate the measured data for both \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons. This is also observed for meson measurements at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV by ALICE [9], although better description of data is achieved for \u03bc = 2 p T , for which calculations are above data by 10\u221240% depending on p T . It has to be noted that FF uncertainties of NLO pQCD calculations have been considerably reduced after including the published \u03c0 0 measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV [3] for DSS14. Including precise new data for \u03b7 meson production measured at \u221a s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV [3,9] will also help to considerably reduce NLO pQCD uncertainty bands in that case. In addition, the reported neutral meson measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV are compared to PYTHIA8.210 [18] references; Tune 4C [19] and Monash 2013 tune [20]. To enable a proper comparison of the PYTHIA tunes with the measured neutral meson spectra, \u03c0 0 from decays of long-living strange particles (K 0 S , , and ) are excluded. The Tune 4C calculation is about 30% above the \u03c0 0 measurement for p T > 1.5 GeV/c. In contrast, the Monash 2013 tune reproduces the \u03c0 0 spectrum within 10% for almost the complete transverse momentum range, although both tunes are not able to describe the shape of the measured spectrum indicated by the bump at approximately 3 GeV/c. Concerning the \u03b7 meson, both tunes reproduce the measured spectrum for p T > 1.5 GeV/c within uncertainties. At lower momenta p T < 1.5 GeV/c, both tunes follow the same trend and deviate significantly in magnitude and shape from data. The tuning parameters of the soft QCD part of PYTHIA apparently fail to describe the measured \u03b7 meson spectrum below p T < 1.5 GeV/c, whereas there is further tension up to p T \u2248 3.5 GeV/c. On the other hand, both PYTHIA tunes are consistent within uncertainties with the measured \u03c0 0 spectrum for the low transverse momentum interval 0.3 < p T < 1.5 GeV/c.",

            "text": "The mean transverse momenta, p T , are determined for the neutral meson spectra shown in Fig. 7. Three different fit functions are used in this context: a TCM, Eq. 3, a Tsallis, Eq. 4, and a modified Hagedorn [58] fit that is used as the default fit function, since it yields the best agreement with data at lowest p T measured [38]. The obtained values for \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons are listed in Table 6, where statistical and systematic uncertainties are quoted. The additional uncertainty term denoted with \"fit sys\" reflects the choice of the fitting function. Moreover, the introduced fit functions are also used to calculate the integrated yields, dN /dy| y \u2248 0 , for both neutral mesons in inelastic events. The cross section for inelastic pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, \u03c3 INEL = 74.7 \u00b1 1.7 mb [59], is used for this purpose. The obtained yields are given in Table  6, which are based on extrapolation fractions, F extpol , of about 45% for the \u03c0 0 and about 34% for the \u03b7 meson. Additionally, the integrated \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio is estimated and can be found in Table 6 as well. For the recent paper by ALICE on neutral meson production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [9], the mean p T as well as the integrated yields are also calculated for the reported spectra, which are furthermore added to Table  6. The inelastic pp cross section at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, quoted in Ref. [9] as well, is used to calculate the integrated yields which include extrapolation fractions of about 59% for the \u03c0 0 and about 52% for the \u03b7 meson. The obtained values for p T and dN /dy| y \u2248 0 for both neutral mesons are compared with measurements of average transverse momenta of charged particles [60] and with results concerning charged-particle multiplicity [61]. Due to a large extrapolation fraction of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson spectra with respect to charged particles and the given systematics for the lowest transverse momenta, the uncertainties of p T and dN /dy| y \u2248 0 are found to be larger. Hence, the integrated \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios are also affected. Nevertheless, all values quoted in this paragraph are consistent within experimental uncertainties with the results from charged particle measurements [47,62]. Within their substantial uncertainties, the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios at both pp energies are found to be consistent as well.",

            "text": "The validity of m T scaling is tested by means of the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio. For this purpose, the TCM parameterization of the measured \u03c0 0 spectrum, given in Table 5, is used to obtain the \u03b7 spectrum via the application of m T scaling by replacing the \u03c0 0 mass with the \u03b7 mass and using the normalization ratio C \u03b7 /C \u03c0 0 = 0.455. From these two spectra, the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio is constructed, plotted as blue curve in the right part of Fig. 8. The measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio is consistent with the m T scaling prediction (blue curve) above p T > 3.5 GeV/c. However, for smaller transverse momenta of p T < 3.5 GeV/c the ratio of the measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio over the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio obtained with m T scaling, which can be found in Ref. [38], constantly decreases and reaches about 45% at around 1 GeV/c. For the region below 3.5 GeV/c, m T scaling is observed to be clearly broken with a significance of 6.2\u03c3 . Given this observation, the measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV, previously reported by ALICE [3,9], are re-evaluated. Whereas there is indication for a m T scaling violation with 2.1\u03c3 for 2.76 TeV, we also observe a significant disagreement of 5.7\u03c3 for 7 TeV. Hence, both ratios are found to be consistent with our observation at 8 TeV. Furthermore, both \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios are fitted with a constant for p T > 3.5 GeV/c, yielding values of C \u03b7/\u03c0 0 = 0.474 \u00b1 0.015(stat) \u00b1 0.024(sys) for 2.76 TeV and C \u03b7/\u03c0 0 = 0.476 \u00b1 0.020(stat) \u00b1 0.020(sys) for 7 TeV. They are consistent within uncertainties with the measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio at 8 TeV for the given p T range. Therefore, all three ALICE measurements are simultaneously fitted with a constant for p T > 3.5 GeV/c in order to obtain a combined value of C \u03b7/\u03c0 0 = 0.459 \u00b1 0.006(stat) \u00b1 0.011(sys). For the region p T < 3.5 GeV/c, all collision energies covered by ALICE also agree within experimental uncertainties, so that \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios may be claimed to be consistent within accuracy for ALICE measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV.",

            "text": "Before the LHC era, the precision of \u03b7/\u03c0 0 measurements was not sufficient to probe m T scaling over broad ranges of p T with high statistics. PHENIX and NA27 provide the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio with highest accuracy at high and low p T and therefore are compared to the reported measurement. PHENIX measurements for pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV are available only for p T region > 2.25 GeV/c [63], where \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra are already described by m T scaling. However, PHENIX notably does not apply any secondary \u03c0 0 correction concerning weak decays, which further has to be taken into account when comparing with data points from ALICE. Measurements of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra in pp collisions at \u221a s = 27.5 GeV from NA27 [64] are used to obtain the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio in the p T range of 0.4 < p T < 1.6 GeV/c. The paper does not mention a secondary correction of \u03c0 0 spectrum; however, it cannot significantly change the conclusions to be drawn from the measurement. Although the NA27 measurement provides the world's most precise published data points for the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio at low p T < 2.0 GeV/c in the pre-LHC era for pp collisions, it is not conclusive concerning m T scaling violation. The first NA27 points at p T < 1 GeV/c are consistent with both the m T scaling curve and the new data from pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV within uncertainties, whereas for p T > 1 GeV/c the results of NA27 show a tendency to be above the m T scaling prediction, although uncertainties become significant. A clearer confirmation of the m T scaling at low p T is observed for other particle species, such as kaons, \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [13]. Whether the magnitude of m T scaling violation depends on the collision energy can be clarified in future by ongoing analysis of hadron spectra measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV delivered by the LHC.",

NLO pQCD calculations with MSTW08 (PDF) with DSS14 (FF) for the \u03c0 0 and CTEQ6M5 (PDF) with AESSS (FF) for the \u03b7 meson overestimate the measured spectra of both neutral mesons. This discrepancy is also reported for pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV by ALICE. However, the ratio of \u03b7/\u03c0 0 is reproduced by NLO pQCD calculations within uncertainties, which is a test for the FFs in the factorized picture of pQCD. The prediction from PYTHIA8.2 Tune 4C describes the \u03b7 spectrum within uncertainties for p T > 1.5 GeV/c, but it is about 30% larger than the measured \u03c0 0 production cross section. On the other hand, the Monash 2013 tune agrees with the reported neutral meson measurements within 10% for p T > 1.5 GeV/c. Both PYTHIA8.2 tunes are able to reproduce the \u03c0 0 spectrum below p T < 1.5 GeV/c within uncertainties, but fail to describe the \u03b7 spectrum in this region. The \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio is described by m T scaling for p T > 3.5 GeV/c, whereas a deviation from this empirical scaling law is found for p T < 3.5 GeV/c with a significance of 6.2\u03c3 . Within experimental uncertainties, the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratios measured by NA27, PHENIX and ALICE are in agreement for the covered transverse momentum intervals of each measurement, representing pp collisions starting at center of mass energies of \u221a s = 27.5 GeV up to \u221a s = 8 TeV. mann for providing the pQCD calculations.
