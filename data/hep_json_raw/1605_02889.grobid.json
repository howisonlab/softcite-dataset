Owing to purification of the xenon-loaded liquid scintillator, we achieved a significant reduction of the 110m Ag contaminant identified in previous searches. Combining the results from the first and second phase, we obtain a lower limit for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 1.07 \u00d7 10 26 yr at 90% C.L., an almost sixfold improvement over previous limits. Using commonly adopted nuclear matrix element calculations, the corresponding upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass are in the range 61 -165 meV. For the most optimistic nuclear matrix elements, this limit reaches the bottom of the quasi-degenerate neutrino mass region.",

Observation of this decay would demonstrate the non-conservation of lepton number, and prove that neutrinos have a Majorana mass component. In the framework of light Majorana neutrino exchange, its decay rate is proportional to the square of the effective Majorana neutrino mass m \u03b2\u03b2 \u2261 i U 2 ei m \u03bdi . Recent 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 searches [1] involving 76 Ge (GERDA [2]) and 136 Xe (KamLAND-Zen [3] and EXO-200 [4]) provide upper limits on m \u03b2\u03b2 of \u223c0.2 -0.4 eV using available nuclear matrix element (NME) values from the literature. The sensitivities of these searches correspond to mass scales in the so-called quasi-degenerate mass region.",

The KamLAND-Zen detector consists of 13 tons of Xe-loaded liquid scintillator (Xe-LS) contained in a 3.08-m-diameter spherical inner balloon (IB) located at the center of the KamLAND detector. The IB is constructed from 25-\u00b5m-thick transparent nylon film and is surrounded by 1 kton of liquid scintillator (LS) contained in a 13-m-diameter spherical outer balloon (OB). The outer LS acts as an active shield. The scintillation photons are viewed by 1,879 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on the inner surface of the containment vessel. The Xe-LS consists of 80.7% decane and 19.3% pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) by volume, 2.29 g/liter of the fluor PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole), and (2.91 \u00b1 0.04)% by weight of isotopically enriched xenon gas. The isotopic abundances in the enriched xenon were measured by a residual gas analyzer to be (90.77 \u00b1 0.08)% 136 Xe, (8.96 \u00b1 0.02)% 134 Xe. Other xenon isotopes have negligible presence. The two electrons emitted from 136 Xe \u03b2\u03b2 decay produce scintillation light and their summed energy is observed. Hypothetical 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays would produce a peak at the Q-value of the decay, distinguishable from 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays which have a continuous spectrum.",

The sensitivity of the Phase-I search was limited by the presence of an unexpected background peak, consistent with 110m Ag \u03b2 \u2212 decay (\u03c4 = 360 day, Q = 3.01 MeV), just above the 2.458 MeV Q-value of 136 Xe \u03b2\u03b2 decay. After completing Phase-I, we embarked on a Xe-LS purification campaign that continued for 18 months. First we extracted the Xe-LS in small batches from the IB through a Teflon tube whose intake was near the bottom of the IB volume. We then isolated and stored the Xe before placing the Xe-depleted LS back to the top of the IB where it was later replaced by new LS. This new LS was initially purified by water extraction followed by vacuum distillation. The replacement of the Xe-depleted LS was performed in three cycles equivalent to one IB volume exchange for each cycle. The LS was purified by vacuum distillation during each cycle. We also purified a mix of recovered and new Xe through distillation and refining with a heated zirconium getter. Finally, the Xe was dissolved into the purified LS. In December 2013, we started the second science run (Phase-II), and found a reduction of 110m Ag by more than a factor of 10. We report on the analysis of the complete Phase-II data set, collected between December 11, 2013, and October 27, 2015. The total livetime is 534.5 days after muon spallation cuts, discussed later. This corresponds to an exposure of 504 kg-yr of 136 Xe with the whole Xe-LS volume.",

The event position reconstruction -determined from the scintillation photon arrival times -reproduces the known source positions to within 2.0 cm; the reconstruction performance is better than 1.0 cm for events occurring within 1 m of the IB center. The energy scale was studied using \u03b3-rays from 60 Co, 68 Ge, and 137 Cs radioactive sources, \u03b3-rays from the capture of spallation neutrons on protons and 12 C, and \u03b2 + \u03b3-ray emissions from 214 Bi, a daughter of 222 Rn (\u03c4 = 5.5 day) that was introduced during the Xe-LS purification. The calibration data indicate that the reconstructed energy varies by less than 1.0% throughout the Xe-LS volume, and the time variation of the energy scale is less than 1.0%. Uncertainties from the nonlinear energy response due to scintillator quenching and Cherenkov light production are constrained by the calibrations. The light yield of the Xe-LS is 7% lower than that of the outer LS, which is corrected in the detector simulation, while the non-linearities for both the LS regions are consistent. The observed energy resolution is \u03c3 \u223c 7.3%/ E(MeV), slightly worse relative to Phase-I due to an increased number of dead PMTs.",

            "text": "We apply the following series of cuts to select \u03b2\u03b2 decay events: (i) The reconstructed vertex must be within 2.0 m of the detector center. (ii) Muons and events within 2 ms after muons are rejected. (iii) 214 Bi-214 Po (\u03c4 =237 \u00b5s) decays are eliminated by a delayed coincidence tag, requiring the time and distance between the prompt 214 Bi and delayed 214 Po decay-events to be less than 1.9 ms and 1.7 m, respectively. The cut removes (99.95 \u00b1 0.01)% of 214 Bi-214 Po decays, where the inefficiency is dominated by the timing cut, and the uncertainty is estimated from analysis of periods with high Rn levels. The same cut is not effective for 212 Bi-212 Po (\u03c4 =0.4 \u00b5s) decays which occur within a single \u223c200-ns-long data acquisition event window. Therefore, the cut is augmented with a double-pulse identification in the photon arrival time distribution after subtracting the time of flight from the vertex to each PMT. The 212 Bi-212 Po rejection efficiency is (95 \u00b1 3)%, confirmed with high-Rn data. (iv) Reactor \u03bd e 's identified by a delayed coincidence of positrons and neutron-capture \u03b3's [6] are discarded. (v) Poorly reconstructed events are rejected. These events are tagged using a vertex-time-charge discriminator which measures how well the observed PMT time-charge distributions agree with those expected based on the reconstructed vertex [7]. The total cut inefficiency for \u03b2\u03b2 events is less than 0.1%. Background sources external to the Xe-LS are dominated by radioactive impurities on the IB film. Based on a spectral fit to events reconstructed around the IB, we find that the dominant background sources are 134 Cs (\u03b2 + \u03b3, \u03c4 = 2.97 yr) in the energy region 1.2 < E < 2.0 MeV (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window), and 214 Bi in the region 2.3 < E < 2.7 MeV (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window). The observed activity ratio of 134 Cs to 137 Cs (0.662 MeV \u03b3, \u03c4 = 43.4 yr) indicates that the IB film was contaminated by fallout from the Fukushima-I reactor accident in 2011 [8]. 214 Bi is a daughter of 238 U, a naturally occurring contaminant. The observed rate of 214 Bi decays indicates that the 238 U concentration in the nylon film is 0.16 ppb assuming secular equilib- rium, while the ex situ measurement by ICP-MS yielded 2 ppt. The non-uniform 214 Bi event distribution observed on the IB indicates that this discrepancy is caused by dust contamination rather than decay chain non-equilibrium. Figure 1 (a) shows the vertex distribution of candidate events, and the predicted 214 Bi background events from a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window. The z-distribution of 214 Bi decays on the IB is evaluated from the data, and used for the radioactive decay model in the MC. For the 214 Bi background, the vertex dispersion model was constructed from a full MC simulation based on Geant4 [9, 10] including decay-particle tracking, scintillation photon processes, and finite PMT timing resolution. This MC reproduces the observed vertex distance between 214 Bi and 214 Po sequential decay events from the initial 222 Rn contamination within the Xe-LS. An enlarged 3.5-m-radius spherical volume was used to study a high statistics sample of muon spallation products and better constrain their background contributions. This included a region outside the IB. We assess a 22% systematic uncertainty on the calculated spallation yields in the Xe-LS, taking account of the observed (20 \u00b1 2)% increase in the spallation neutron flux in the Xe-LS relative to the outer LS. In the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window, events from 10 C decays (\u03b2 + , \u03c4 = 27.8 s, Q = 3.65 MeV) dominate the contribution from muon spallation. A triple-coincidence tag of a muon, a neutron identified by neutron-capture \u03b3-rays, and the 10 C decay [11], reduces the 10 C background with an efficiency of (64 \u00b1 4)%. Postmuon spallation-neutron events are recorded by newly introduced dead-time free electronics. We apply spherical volume cuts (\u2206R < 1.6 m) around the reconstructed neutron ver-tices for 180 s after the preceding muon. We estimate that the remaining 10 C background after cuts is (1.01 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7 10 \u22122 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 , where ton is a unit of Xe-LS mass. Other shorter-lived products, e.g., 6 He and 12 B, are also reduced by the triple-coincidence tag and have a minor contribution to the background. The dead-time introduced by all the spallation cuts is 7%. In the Xe-LS, long-lived 137 Xe (\u03b2 \u2212 , \u03c4 = 5.5 min, Q = 4.17 MeV) is a background source produced by neutron capture on 136 Xe. Based on the spallation neutron rate and the 136 Xe capture cross section [12], the production yield of 137 Xe is estimated to be (3.9\u00b12.0)\u00d710 \u22123 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 , which is consistent with the simulation study in FLUKA [13,14].",

However, the sensitivity is dominated by the innermost 1-m-radius spherical volume due to the background from the IB. The region outside this radius serves to strongly constrain the tails of the IB background extending into the innermost region. Further, anticipating the decay of the 110m Ag background identified in Phase-I, we divide the Phase-II data set into two equal time periods (Period-1 and Period-2) each roughly equal to one average lifetime of the 110m Ag decay rate. Table I lists the number of observed events, and the estimated and bestfit background contributions in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window within a 1m-radius spherical volume for each of the two time periods. The fit is described in detail below. We find a precipitous decrease in the event rate in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window in Period-2. The Period-2 background components are well-constrained near the values listed in Table I with the exception of 110m Ag. The hypothesis of standard radioactive decay of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window background with the decay rate of 110m Ag is disfavored relative to the hypothesis of a faster reduction at 96% C.L. The origin of this apparent reduction of 110m Ag is unknown, but we speculate that much of it settled to the bottom of the IB where only a small fraction of 110m Ag decays are reconstructed in the inner Xe-LS volume. In order to allow the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window background the greatest freedom in the fit, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay analyses are performed independently for Period-1 and Period-2.",

To obtain a 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate free of such systematic uncertainty, we perform a separate estimate using a likelihood fit to the binned energy spectrum of the selected candidates between 0.5 MeV and 4.8 MeV, limited to a volume within the 1-m-radius spherical fiducial volume (FV 2\u03bd ). The corresponding fiducial exposure of 136 Xe is 126 kg-yr. The contributions from major backgrounds in the Xe-LS, such as 85 Kr, 40 K, 210 Bi, and the 228 Th-208 Pb sub-chain of the 232 Th series are free parameters and are left unconstrained in the spectral fit. We confirmed that the 134 Cs contribution in the Xe-LS is negligible from a fit. The contributions from the 222 Rn-210 Pb sub-chain of the 238 U series, muon spallation products, and detector energy response model parameters are allowed to vary but are constrained by their independent estimations. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 de- cay rates for Period-1 and Period-2 are 100.1 +1.1 \u22121.8 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 and 100.1 +1.0 \u22120.9 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 , respectively, and are in agreement within the statistical uncertainties. The resolution tail in 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays is an important background in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 analysis. Such tail events are reproduced in 214 Bi decays with high-Rn data assuming the Gaussian resolution, indicating that a contribution from energy reconstruction failures is negligible.",

So we divide the FV into 20-equal-volume bins for each of the upper and lower hemispheres (see Fig. 1 (a)). We perform a simultaneous fit to the energy spectra for all volume bins. The z-dependence of 214 Bi on the IB film is extracted from a fixed energy window dominated by these events. The 214 Bi background contribution is then broken into two independent distributions in the upper and lower hemispheres whose normalizations are floated as free parameters. The fit reproduces the energy spectra for each volume bin; Fig. 1 (b) shows an example of the energy spectrum in a volume bin with high 214 Bi background events around the IB film. The radial dependences of candidate events and best-fit background contributions in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window are illustrated in Fig. 1 (c). The possible background contributions from 110m Ag are free parameters in the fit. We consider three independent components: 110m Ag uniformly dispersed in the Xe-LS volume, and on the surfaces of each the lower and upper IB films. We also examined non-uniform 110m Ag sources, with different assumed radial dependences, in the Xe-LS but determined that this has little impact on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 limit.",

To demonstrate the low background levels achieved in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 region, Fig. 2 shows the energy spectra within a 1-m-radius, together with the bestfit background composition and the 90% C.L. upper limit for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays.

Our search constrains the mass scale to lie below \u223c100 meV, and the most advantageous nuclear matrix element calculations indicate an effective Majorana neutrino mass limit near the bottom of the quasi-degenerate neutrino mass region. The current KamLAND-Zen search is limited by backgrounds from 214 Bi, 110m Ag, muon spallation and partially by the tail of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays. In order to improve the search sensitivity, we plan to upgrade the KamLAND-Zen experiment with a larger Xe-LS volume loaded with 800 kg of enriched Xe, corresponding to a twofold increase in 136 Xe, contained in a larger balloon with lower radioactive background contaminants. If further radioactive background reduction is achieved, the background will be dominated by muon spallation, which can be further reduced by optimization of the spallation cut criteria. Such an improved search will allow m \u03b2\u03b2 to be probed below 50 meV, starting to constrain the inverted mass hierarchy region under the assumption that neutrinos are Majorana particles. The sensitivity of the experiment can be pushed further by improving the energy resolution to minimize the leakage of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 tail into the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 analysis window. Such improvement is the target of a future detector upgrade.",
