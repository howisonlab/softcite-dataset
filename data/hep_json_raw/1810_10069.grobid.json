The search is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 16.1 fb \u22121 from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. The dark quark is charged only under a new quantum-chromodynamics-like force, and forms an \"emerging jet\" via a parton shower, containing long-lived dark hadrons that give rise to displaced vertices when decaying to standard model hadrons. The data are consistent with the expectation from standard model processes. Limits are set at 95% confidence level excluding dark pion decay lengths between 5 and 225 mm for dark mediators with masses between 400 and 1250 GeV. Decay lengths smaller than 5 and greater than 225 mm are also excluded in the lower part of this mass range. The dependence of the limit on the dark pion mass is weak for masses between 1 and 10 GeV. This analysis is the first dedicated search for the pair production of a new particle that decays to a jet and an emerging jet.",

            "text": "Although many astrophysical observations indicate the existence of dark matter [1], it has yet to be observed in the laboratory. While it is possible that dark matter has only gravitational interactions, many compelling models of new physics contain a dark matter candidate that interacts with quarks. One class of models includes new, electrically-neutral fermions called \"dark quarks\", Q DK , which are not charged under the forces of the standard model (SM) but are charged under a new force in the dark sector (\"dark QCD\") that has confining properties similar to quantum chromodynamics (SM QCD) [2,3]. Unlike models based on the popular weakly interacting neutral particle paradigm [4], such models naturally explain the observed mass densities of baryonic matter and dark matter [5].",

Emerging jets contain electrically charged SM particles that are consistent with having been created in the decays of new long-lived neutral particles (dark hadrons), produced in a parton-shower process by dark QCD. In this model, dark QCD has an SU(N C DK ) symmetry, where N C DK is the number of dark colors. The particle content of the model consists of the dark fermions, the dark gluons associated with the force, and a mediator particle that is charged under both the new dark force and under SM QCD, thus allowing interactions with quarks. The dark fermions are bound by the new force into dark hadrons. These hadrons decay via the mediator to SM hadrons. Figure 1.

There are restrictions on the values of the Yukawa couplings from searches for flavor-changing neutral currents, neutral meson mixing, and rare decays [8][9][10][11].

The signature for this search thus consists of four high transverse momentum (p T ) jets, two from down quarks and two from dark quarks. The dark quark jets contain many displaced vertices arising from the decays of the dark pions produced in the dark parton shower and fragmentation. For models with dark hadron decay lengths comparable to the size of the detector, there can also be significant missing transverse momentum (p miss T ). The main background for this signature is SM four-jet production, where jet(s) are tagged as emerging either because they contain long-lived B mesons or because of track misreconstruction, and large artificial p miss T is created because of jet energy mismeasurement. We use a photon+jets data sample to measure the probability for an SM jet to pass selection criteria designed for emerging jets, and use this probability in estimating the background, as described in section 5.",

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of the momenta of associated particles. Additional identification criteria for the emerging jets are given in section 4. For the SM jets, the momentum is found in the simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum for jets, created from the fragmentation of SM quarks and gluons, over the entire p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, charged hadrons not associated with the PV are removed from the list of reconstructed particles using the pileup charged-hadron subtraction algorithm [19], while an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions [20][21][22]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and are confirmed with in situ measurements with the energy balance of Drell-Yan+jet, dijet, multijet, and photon+jet events [23].",

These samples are also used for the construction of the templates for background estimation and the validation of background estimation techniques. The simulation of SM processes, unless otherwise stated, is performed at leading order in the strong coupling constant using MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 [25] or pythia 8.2 [26] with the NNPDF3.0 [27] parton distribution functions (PDFs). The strong coupling constant at the Z mass scale is set to 0.130 in the generator. Parton shower development and hadronization are simulated with pythia using the underlying-event tune CUETP8M1 [28]. Signal samples are generated with the \"hidden valley\" model framework in pythia 8.212, using modifications discussed in ref. [7]. The model has several parameters: the mass of the mediator particle, the width of the mediator particle, the number of dark colors, the number of dark flavors, the matrix of Yukawa couplings between the Q DK and the quarks with the same electric charge as the mediator, the dark force confinement scale, the masses of the Q DK (one for each dark flavor), the mass of the dark pion, the dark pion proper decay length, and the mass of the dark rho meson. Following ref. [7], we assume that there are three dark colors and seven dark flavors as suggested in ref. [6]. We assume that all Q DK (and therefore dark pions) are mass degenerate and that the Q DK mass equals the dark force confinement scale. The mass of the dark pion is assumed to be one half the mass of the Q DK . The mass of the dark rho meson is taken to be four times larger than -  1,2,5,25,45,60,100,150,225, 300, 500, 1000 the mass of the dark pion. The width of the mediator particle is assumed to be small as compared with the detector mass resolution. These assumptions leave the mediator mass m X DK , the dark pion mass m \u03c0 DK , and the dark pion proper decay length c\u03c4 \u03c0 DK as free parameters. Samples are generated for all permutations of the values of these parameters listed in table 1. Each set of values defines a single model.",

Two basic categories of selections -7 -JHEP02(2019)179 emerge. Other than set 3, the signal region selection sets require two jets pass emerging jet criteria, and have no requirement on p miss T . Selection set 3 requires that one jet satisfies the emerging jet criteria, and includes a requirement on p miss T .

Selection set 3 is used for signal models with dark pions with large proper decay lengths. The selection on IP 2D is large enough that it removes most events containing b quark jets with tracks with large impact parameters due to the b lifetime; most SM jets thus selected have tracks with large impact parameters due to misreconstruction.

The sample with an enhanced fraction of b jets is selected by requiring the event to contain at least one additional jet with p T > 50 GeV, beyond the one used in the misidentification probability calculation, that has a value for the discriminator of the CSVv2 algorithm greater than 0.8. The sample with suppressed probability of containing a b jet requires an additional jet with p T > 50 GeV with a CSVv2 discriminator value below 0.2.

The dark quark is assumed to be charged only under a new quantumchromodynamics-like dark force, and to form an emerging jet via a parton shower, containing long-lived dark hadrons that give rise to displaced vertices when decaying to standard model hadrons. The data are consistent with the expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits are set at 95% confidence level excluding dark pion decay lengths between 5 and 225 mm for dark mediators with masses between 400 and 1250 GeV. Decay lengths smaller than 5 and greater than 225 mm are also excluded in the lower part of this mass range. The dependence of the limit on the dark pion mass is weak for masses between JHEP02(2019)179 1 and 10 GeV. This analysis is the first dedicated search for the pair production of a new particle that decays to a jet and an emerging jet.",
