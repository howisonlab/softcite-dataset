These data are required to improve predictions of the neutrino flux for the T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. A set of data collected during the first NA61/SHINE run in 2007 with an isotropic graphite target with a thickness of 4% of a nuclear interaction length was used for the analysis. The measured p + C inelastic and production cross sections are 257.2 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 8.9 and 229.3 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 9.0 mb, respectively. Inclusive production cross sections for negatively and positively charged pions are presented as functions of laboratory momentum in ten intervals of the laboratory polar angle covering the range from 0 up to 420 mrad. The spectra are compared with predictions of several hadron production models.",

            "text": "The NA61/SHINE (SPS heavy ion and neutrino experiment) experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) pursues a rich physics program in various fields [1][2][3][4]. First, precise hadron production measurements are performed for improving calculations of the neutrino flux in the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment [5], as well as for more reliable simulations of cosmic-ray air showers in the Pierre Auger and KASCADE experiments [6,7]. Second, p + p, p + Pb, and nucleus + nucleus collisions will be studied extensively at SPS energies. A collision energy and system size scan will be performed with the aim of studying properties of the onset of deconfinement and searching for the critical point of strongly interacting matter. This paper presents the first NA61/SHINE results on charged pion spectra in p + C interactions at 31 GeV/c, which are needed for an accurate neutrino flux prediction in the T2K experiment. The results are based on the data collected during the first run in 2007. NA61/SHINE is a large-acceptance hadron spectrometer [1]. Its main detector components, software, calibration, and analysis methods were inherited from the NA49 experiment [8,9].",

            "text": "T2K is a long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan, which uses a high-intensity neutrino beam produced at J-PARC. 1 It aims to precisely measure the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e appearance and \u03bd \u03bc disappearance [5]. In order to generate the neutrino beam a high-intensity 30 GeV (kinetic energy) proton beam impinging on a 90-cm-long graphite target is used, where \u03c0 and K mesons decaying into (anti)neutrinos are produced. The neutrino fluxes and spectra are then measured both at the near-detector complex, 280 m from the target, and by the Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector located 295 km away from the neutrino source and 2.5 \u2022 off-axis. Neutrino oscillations are probed by comparing the neutrino flux measured at SK to the predicted one. In order to predict the flux at SK one uses the near-detector measurements and extrapolates them to SK with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. Up to now, these Monte Carlo predictions have been based on hadron production models only. For more precise predictions, which would allow the reduction of systematic uncertainties to the level needed for the T2K physics goals, measurements of pion and kaon production off carbon targets are essential [1][2][3]. The purpose of the NA61/SHINE measurements for T2K is to provide this information at exactly the proton extraction energy of the J-PARC Main Ring synchrotron, namely, 30 GeV kinetic energy (approximately 31 GeV/c momentum). Presently, the T2K neutrino beamline is set up to focus positively charged hadrons, in such a way that it produces a \u03bd \u03bc beam. Spectra of positively charged pions presented in this paper constitute directly an essential ingredient in the neutrino flux calculation. The kinematic region of interest for positively charged pions whose daughter muon neutrinos pass through the SK detector is shown in Fig. 1 The prediction from the T2K beam simulation: the {p, \u03b8} distribution for positively charged pions weighted by the probability that their decay produces a muon neutrino passing through the SK detector. p-the momentum of a given particle and \u03b8 -its polar angle in the laboratory frame.",

Incident proton momenta from 3 up to 12 GeV/c were explored by the HARP Collaboration [14] for a large variety of nuclear targets, including carbon [15]. Almost 40 years ago an experiment was performed at CERN at 24 GeV/c [16]. Several targets were used but the momentum and angular range of produced particles was limited to angles from 17 to 127 mrad and momenta from 4 to 18 GeV/c. Recently the MIPP particle production experiment at Fermilab presented preliminary results from its first data collected at 120 GeV/c [17]. Precise measurements of pion production in proton-carbon interactions at 158 GeV/c are available from the NA49 Collaboration [9].",

A set of scintillation and Cherenkov counters as well as beam position detectors (BPDs) upstream of the spectrometer provide timing reference, identification, and position measurements of the incoming beam particles. Details on this system are presented in Sec. III. The main tracking devices of the spectrometer are large-volume time projection chambers (TPCs). Two of them, the vertex TPCs (VTPC-1 and VTPC-2 in Fig. 2), are located in a free gap of 100 cm between the upper and lower coils of the two superconducting dipole magnets. Their maximum combined bending power is 9 Tm. In order to optimize the acceptance of the detector at 31 GeV/c beam momentum, the magnetic field used during the 2007 data-taking period was set to a bending power of 1.14 Tm. Two large-volume main TPCs (MTPC-L and MTPC-R) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically to the beam line. The TPCs are filled with Ar:CO 2 gas mixtures in proportions 90:10 for VTPCs and 95:5 for MTPCs. The particle identification capability of the TPCs based on measurements of the specific energy loss dE/dx is augmented by time-of-flight measurements (tof ) using time-of-flight (ToF) detectors. The ToF-L and ToF-R arrays of scintillator pixels have a time resolution of better than 90 ps [8]. Before the 2007 run the experiment was upgraded with a new forward time-of-flight detector (ToF-F) in order to extend the acceptance. The ToF-F consists of 64 scintillator bars with photomultiplier (PMT) readout at both ends resulting in a time resolution of about 115 ps. The target under study is installed 80 cm in front of the VTPC-1. The results presented here were obtained with an isotropic graphite target of dimensions 2.5 (W ) \u00d7 2.5 (H ) \u00d7 2 (L) cm and with a density of \u03c1 = 1.84 g/cm 3 .

The beam is transported along the H2 beamline toward the experiment. Collimators in the beamline are adjusted to get an average beam particle rate of 15 kHz. The setup of beam detectors is illustrated in the inset on Fig. 2. Protons from the secondary hadron beam are identified by two Cherenkov counters, a CEDAR [18] and a threshold counter, labeled C1 and C2, respectively. The CEDAR counter, using a sixfold coincidence, provides positive identification of protons, while the threshold Cherenkov counter, operated at pressure lower than the proton threshold, is used in anticoincidence in the trigger logic. The fraction of protons in the beam was about 14%. A selection based on signals from Cherenkov counters allowed the identification of beam protons with a purity of about 99%. A consistent value for the purity was found by bending the beam into the TPCs with the full magnetic field and using the dE/dx identification method.",

Measurements of tof are not available for low-momentum particles since they do not reach the ToF-F detectors. A reliable identification of \u03c0 + mesons was not possible at momenta above 1 GeV/c where the Bethe-Bloch (BB) curves for pions, kaons, and protons cross each other (see Fig. 8). On the other hand, for \u03c0 \u2212 mesons, where the contribution of K \u2212 and antiprotons is almost negligible, the dE/dx analysis could be extended in momentum up to 3 GeV/c, allowing consistency checks with the other analysis methods in the region of overlap.  The procedure of particle identification, described below, is tailored to the region where a fast change of energy loss with momentum is observed. In order to optimize the parametrization of the BB function, samples of e \u00b1 , \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p, and d tracks with reliable particle identification were chosen in the \u03b2\u03b3 range from 0.2 up to 100. The dependence of the BB function on \u03b2\u03b3 was then fitted to the data using the Sternheimer and Peierls parametrization of Ref. [29]. This  function was then used to calculate for every track of a given momentum the expected (dE/dx) BB values for all possible identification hypotheses for comparison with the measured mean (dE/dx) data . A small (a few percent) dependence of the mean (dE/dx) data on the track polar angle had to be corrected for.",

V A were applied. In addition only tracks which gave a signal in the ToF-F detector were selected. Two independent topologies of tracks, emitted to the left and to the right with respect to the incoming beam direction, have different acceptances. The analysis was performed for each topology separately. When both topologies are present the final result is the weighted average of the two. Momentum-dependent azimuthal angle cuts were applied such that in these angular intervals the detector acceptance was close to 100%. These cuts select tracks with a large number of measured points as well, thus with a high reconstruction efficiency. The averaged individual as well as combined global correction factors are shown in Fig. 19 for illustration. The pion accumulations in these distributions were parametrized by a product of Gaussian functions in m 2 and dE/dx. In each (p,\u03b8 ) bin the bin-by-bin maximum likelihood method was applied to fit yields of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 mesons. In the fit the signal shapes parametrized in the first step were allowed to vary within narrow limits.

Systematic errors on the pion spectra were estimated by varying track selection and identification criteria as well as parameters used to calculate the corrections. The following track selection criteria were varied: the minimum number of points measured on the track, the azimuthal angle, and the impact parameter cuts. It was found that the influence of such changes is small as compared to the statistical errors. The accuracy of corrections for acceptance and reconstruction efficiency was checked by comparison of the results obtained with independent track topologies as well as using two different algorithms for merging track segments from different TPCs into global tracks (track merging algorithm). The dominant contributions to the systematic error for all three analysis methods come from the uncertainty in the correction for secondary interactions and for weak decays of strange particles. We assigned an uncertainty of 30% of the correction for both sources.

In the h \u2212 analysis a 20% uncertainty in the correction for electron admixture to the pion sample was assumed. Examples of systematic errors for all three analyses are presented in the bottom panels of Figs. 16, 18, and 19. Losses of inelastic interactions because an emitted particle hits the S4 counter were estimated to be negligibly small, namely, about 1% or smaller in the relevant phase space for the analysis. The total systematic error was calculated as a sum of different contributions added in quadrature. It does not include the overall uncertainty due to the normalization procedure, namely, 2.5% and 2.3% for the normalization to the inclusive cross section and mean pion multiplicity in production events, respectively. Statistical and systematic uncertainties were added in quadrature in order to calculate the total error. The first quoted error always refers to the statistical and the second to the systematic uncertainty.",

            "text": "The data presented in this paper already provide important information for calculating the T2K neutrino flux. Meanwhile, a much larger data set with both the thin (4% \u03bb I ) and the T2K replica carbon targets was recorded in 2009 and 2010 and is presently being analyzed. This will lead to results of higher precision for pions and extend the measurements to other hadron species such as charged kaons, protons, K 0 S and . The new data will allow a further significant reduction of the uncertainties in the prediction of the neutrino flux in the T2K experiment.
