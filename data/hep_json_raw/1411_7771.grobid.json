Our result is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions as well as with a recent measurement from LHCb. We observe no statistically significant signal for the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and set a 90% confidence-level upper limit on its branching fraction at 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .

            "text": "PACS numbers: 13.20.He, 14.40.Nd In the Standard Model (SM), the exclusive decays B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 are explained by the radiative transitions b \u2192 s\u03b3\u03b3 and b \u2192 s\u03b3, respectively. The leading-order Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Fig. 1. Within the SM framework, the branching fraction (BF) for B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 is expected to be about 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 with 30% uncertainty [1,2]. First observation of this decay was made by the Belle Collaboration using 23.6 fb \u22121 of data collected at the \u03a5(5S) resonance and its BF was measured to be (5.7 +2.2 \u22121.9 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [3]. The latest tabulated world-average value is (3.6 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [4]. These experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the good agreement between theory and experimental results on exclusive decays mediated by b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions [1,2,5,6] as well as on inclusive B \u2192 X s \u03b3 rates [6][7][8] rules out large contributions to B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 from physics beyond the SM. However, potential contributions from new physics could remain hidden within the large uncertainties in the SM predictions [9,10]. The decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 has not been observed yet. Currently, the upper limit on its BF is 8.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 90% confidence level (CL) [3]. This is almost an order of magnitude larger than the range covered by published theoretical calcula-tions [11][12][13]. The B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 BF is also constrained by the B \u2192 X s \u03b3 results in the R-parity conserving SUSY scenario [9]. However, in the R-parity violating (RPV) case, the possible contribution from \u03bb-irreducible diagrams [14] (which have a negligible impact on the b \u2192 s\u03b3 amplitude at one loop) may enhance its BF by more than an order of magnitude [9]. The results presented in this paper are based on 121.4 fb \u22121 of data collected at the \u03a5(5S) resonance with the Belle detector [15,16] at the KEKB [17] asymmetricenergy e + e \u2212 collider at KEK in Japan. The Belle detector consists of a 4-layer silicon vertex detector (SVD), a central drift chamber (CDC), aerogel Cherenkov counters (ACC), time-of-flight counters (TOF) and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL). These detector components are located inside a solenoid with a magnetic field of 1.5 T whose flux-return yoke is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and muons. The bb production cross section at the \u03a5(5S) center of mass (CM) energy is measured to be \u03c3 \u03a5(5S) bb = (0.340 \u00b1 0.016) nb [18], while the fraction of B s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 decays are generated using EvtGen [19]; the response of the detector is simulated using GEANT3 [20], with beam-related backgrounds from data added to the simulated samples. Charged tracks are required to originate from the interaction point (IP) by satisfying the criteria dr < 0.5 cm and |dz | < 3 cm, where |dz | and dr are the distances of closest approach to the IP along the z axis (collinear with the positron beam) and in the transverse r-\u03c6 plane, respectively. Kaons are identified with an efficiency of about 85% by requiring L K /(L K +L \u03c0 ) > 0.6, where L K and L \u03c0 are the likelihoods of the track being due to a kaon and pion, respectively, obtained using information from ACC, CDC and TOF. Tracks failing this requirement are assumed to be pions. To be reconstructed as a \u03c6 meson candidate, a pair of oppositely charged kaons must have an invariant mass within \u00b112 MeV/c 2 (\u00b1 2.5 \u03c3) of the nominal \u03c6 mass. Similarly, the K * 0 candidates in the B 0 \u2192 K * (892) 0 \u03b3 control sample are reconstructed with oppositely charged kaon and pion candidates by",

The \u03c6 helicity angle (\u03b8 hel ) is the angle between the B 0 s momentum and that of one of the \u03c6 daughters in the \u03c6 rest frame. The total fit probability distribution function (PDF) consists of two components: signal and qq background. The signal component is further composed of signal coming from B * sB * s , B * sBs and B sBs decays, the relative fractions being fixed to the values measured in Ref. [18]. Backgrounds arising from B s and non-B s decays are combined with the qq continuum as they have a small contribution and do not peak in the signal region. MC samples are used to parameterize the signal and background PDFs. The PDF for each component is represented by the product of one-dimensional functions since the correlations among the variables are negligible. The M bc , \u2206E, cos \u03b8 hel and C \u2032 NB shapes of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 signal are modeled with the sum of a Crystal Ball (CB) [23] and Gaussian function with a common mean, a CB function, a sin 2 \u03b8 hel distribution and the sum of two Gaussian functions, respectively. The background PDFs are described by an ARGUS function [24] for M bc with its endpoint fixed to 5.434 GeV/c 2 , a first-order Chebychev polynomial for \u2206E, a parabola for cos \u03b8 hel and a Gaussian function for C \u2032 NB . For the B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode, the signal M bc distributions are parameterized with a combination of CB and Gaussian functions with a common mean and the signal \u2206E distributions are modeled with CB functions. The background is described by an ARGUS function for M bc and a firstorder Chebychev polynomial for \u2206E. For both analyses, the signal parameters are determined from MC except for the means and widths of the M bc and \u2206E distributions describing the B * sB * s contribution. The widths of M bc and \u2206E are calibrated using correction factors obtained from the B 0 \u2192 K * (892) 0 \u03b3 control sample. As a cross-check, the branching fraction of this mode is measured and found to be in good agreement with the world average [6]. The M bc mean is similarly adjusted using information from the B s \u2192 D s \u03c0 analysis [18]. The \u2206E mean of the B * sB * s component is allowed to float in the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 analysis. For the B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode, we fix the \u2206E mean to the signal MC value, as the correction to the \u2206E mean, obtained from the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 analysis, is found to be within the statistical error. The uncertainty associated with this procedure is included as a systematic uncertainty for this mode. All background parameters apart from the ARGUS endpoint are allowed to float. In total, we have nine free parameters for the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 fit which are the signal and background yields, \u2206E mean of the B * sB * s component and the background shape parameters. Similarly, for the B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 fit we have four free parameters which are the signal and background yields and the background shape parameters.",

The uncertainty due to PDF parameterization is estimated by the variation in the signal yield when varying each fixed parameter by \u00b11\u03c3. To investigate the extent of a bias in the fit, pseudo-experiments are generated using the same PDFs as in the final fit but with the signal and background yields fixed to the expected values. Events generated from the pseudoexperiments are then fitted to obtain the yield and residual distributions. The observed biases of \u22120.28 \u00b1 0.08 and \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.07 for B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 and B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 are corrected and their uncertainties are assigned as systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties due to kaon identification and tracking efficiency are 1.3% and 0.3%, measured using control samples of  in the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 analysis, which is taken from [4]. To conclude, we have used the entire Belle \u03a5(5S) dataset to measure B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3) = (3.6 \u00b1 0.5(stat.) \u00b1 0.3(syst.) \u00b1 0.6(f s )) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . This improved measurement supersedes our earlier result [3] and is consistent with the-oretical predictions [1,2] and a recent LHCb result [25]. We search for the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, where we observe no statistically significant signal, and set the 90% CL upper limit on its BF at 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . This result is an improvement by a factor of about three over the previous published result, consistent with the expected sensitivity for our data sample. This result rules out large contributions to the B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction from RPV SUSY. It also indicates that the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 could be observed at the upcoming Belle II experiment with a dedicated run at the \u03a5(5S) resonance.",
