Its value can be measured in tree-level processes such as B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 and B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 , where D is a superposition of the D 0 and D 0 flavour eigenstates, and K * 0 is the K * (892) 0 meson. Since loop corrections to these processes are of higher order, the associated theoretical uncertainty on \u03b3 is negligible [3]. As such, measurements of \u03b3 in tree-level decays provide a reference value, allowing searches for potential deviations due to physics beyond the Standard Model in other processes. The combination of measurements by the BaBar [4] and Belle [5] collaborations gives \u03b3 = (67 \u00b1 11) \u2022 [6], whilst an average value of LHCb determinations in 2014 gave \u03b3 = 73 +9 \u221210",

The strategy of using B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 decays to determine \u03b3 from an amplitude analysis of D-meson decays to the three-body final state K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was first proposed in refs. [11,12]. The method requires knowledge of the D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay amplitude across the phase space, and in particular the variation of its strong phase. This may be obtained either by using a model to describe the D-meson decay amplitude in phase space (model-dependent approach), or by using measurements of the phase behaviour of the amplitude (modelindependent approach). The model-independent strategy, used by Belle [13] and LHCb [14,15], incorporates measurements from CLEO [16] of the D decay strong phase in bins across the phase space. The present paper reports a new unbinned model-dependent measurement, following the method used by the BaBar [17][18][19], Belle [20][21][22] and LHCb [23] collaborations in their analyses of B \u00b1 \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * )\u00b1 decays. This method allows the statistical power of the data to be fully exploited.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum p of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors.

Likewise, after a kinematic fit to constrain the B 0 candidate to point towards the PV and the K 0 S candidate to have the K 0 S mass, the reconstructed D-meson candidate must lie within \u00b130 MeV of the D 0 mass. To reconstruct the B 0 mass, a third kinematic fit of the whole decay chain is used, constraining the B 0 candidate to point towards the PV and the D and K 0 S to have their nominal masses. The \u03c7 2 of this fit is used in the multivariate classifier described below. This fit improves the resolution of the m 2 \u00b1 invariant masses and ensures that the reconstructed D candidates are constrained to lie within the kinematic boundaries of the phase space. The K * 0 candidate must have a mass within \u00b150 MeV of the world average value and |cos \u03b8 * | > 0.4, where the decay angle \u03b8 * is defined in the K * 0 rest frame as the angle between the momentum of the kaon daughter of the K * 0 , and the direction opposite to the B 0 momentum.

A boosted decision tree (BDT) [43,44] is trained on simulated signal events and background candidates lying in the high B 0 mass sideband [5500, 6000] MeV in data. This mass range partially overlaps with the range of the invariant mass fit described below. To avoid a potential fit bias, the candidates are randomly split into two disjoint subsamples, A and B, and two independent BDTs (BDTA and BDTB) are trained with them. These classifiers are then applied to the complementary samples. The BDTs are based on 16 discriminating variables: the B 0 meson \u03c7 2 IP , the sum of the \u03c7 2 IP of the K 0 S daughter pions, the sum of the \u03c7 2 IP of the final state particles except the K 0 S daughters, the B 0 and D decay vertex \u03c7 2 , the values of the flight distance significance with respect to the PV for the B 0 , D and K 0 S mesons, the D (K 0 S ) flight distance significance with respect to the B 0 (D) decay vertex, the transverse momenta of the B 0 , D and K * 0 , the cosine of the angle between the momentum direction of the B 0 and the displacement vector from the PV to the B 0 decay vertex, the decay angle of the K * 0 and the \u03c7 2 of the kinematic fit of the whole decay chain. Since some of the variables have different distributions for long or downstream candidates, the two event categories have separate BDTs, giving a total of four independent BDTs.

Candidate events are divided into four subsamples, according to K 0 S type (long or downstream), and whether the candidate is identified as a B 0 or B 0 -meson decay. In the B-candidate invariant mass fit, the B 0 and B 0 samples are combined, since identical distributions are expected for this variable, whilst in the CP violation observables fit (CP fit) they are kept separate. The fit model is similar to that used in the analysis of B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 decays with D-meson decays to two-body final states [25]. The B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 components are each described as the sum of two Crystal Ball functions [46] sharing the same central value, with the relative yields of the two functions and the tail parameters fixed from simulation. The separation between the central values of the B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 PDFs is fixed to the known B 0 -B 0 s mass difference. The ratio of the B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 yields is constrained to be the same in both the long and downstream subsamples. The combinatorial background is described with an exponential PDF. Partially reconstructed B 0 (s) \u2192 D * ( ) K * 0 decays are described with non-parametric functions obtained by applying kernel density estimation [47] to distributions of simulated events. These distributions depend on the helicity state of the D * 0 meson. Due to parity conservation in D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3 and D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 decays, two of the three helicity amplitudes have the same invariant mass distribution.  Figure 2. Invariant mass distribution for B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 long and downstream candidates. The fit result, including signal and background components, is superimposed (solid blue). The points are data, and the different fit components are given in the legend. The two vertical lines represent the signal region in which the CP fit is performed. functions, with the fraction of the longitudinal polarisation in the B 0 s \u2192 D * K * 0 decays unknown and accounted for with a free parameter in the fit. Each of the two functions describing the different helicity states is a weighted sum of non-parametric functions obtained from simulated B 0 s \u2192 D * (D 0 \u03b3)K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 D * (D 0 \u03c0 0 )K * 0 decays, taking into account the known D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 and D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3 branching fractions [48] and the appropriate efficiencies. The PDF for B 0 \u2192 D * K * 0 decays is obtained from that for B 0 s \u2192 D * K * 0 decays, by applying a shift corresponding to the known B 0 -B 0 s mass difference. In the nominal fit, the polarisation fraction is assumed to be the same for B 0 \u2192 D * K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 D * K * 0 decays. The effect of this assumption is taken into account in the systematic uncertainties. The B 0 \u2192 D\u03c1 0 component is also described with a non-parametric function obtained from the simulation, using a data-driven calibration to describe the pion-kaon misidentification efficiency. This component has a very low yield and, to improve the stability of the fit, a Gaussian constraint is applied, requiring the ratio of yields of B 0 \u2192 D\u03c1 0 and B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 to be consistent with its expected value.",

These results are consistent with, and have lower total uncertainties than those reported in ref. [28], where a model independent analysis method is used.
