            "text": "The measurement of charm and beauty production cross sections in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) constitutes an important test of perturbative Quantum Chromo-Dynamic (pQCD) calculations at the highest available collider energies. These calculations use the factorization approach to describe heavy-flavour hadron production as a convolution of three terms: the parton distribution function, the hard parton scattering cross section and the fragmentation function. The parton distribution function describes the initial distribution of quarks and gluons from the colliding protons. The hard parton scattering cross section is calculated as a perturbative series in the coupling constant of strong interaction. The fragmentation function parametrizes the relative production yield and momentum distribution for a heavy quark that hadronizes to particular hadron species. The production cross section of beauty hadrons at Tevatron ( \u221a s = 1.96 TeV) [1][2][3] and at the LHC ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) [4,5] is well described by perturbative calculations at next-to-leading order (e.g. GM-VFNS [6,7]) or at fixed order with next-to-leading-log resummation (FONLL [8,9]). The production cross section of charmed hadrons at Tevatron [10][11][12] and at the LHC [13][14][15][16], as well as the RHIC heavy-flavour decay lepton measurements at \u221a s = 200 GeV [17][18][19], are also well reproduced within the uncertainties of the pQCD calculations. However, the overall comparison suggests that the calculation, as obtained with its central parameters, underestimates charm production. The measurement of charm production as a function of the centre-of-mass energy therefore provides an interesting probe of pQCD. The relative abundances of open charmed hadrons also test the statistical hadronization scenario [20] of charm quarks into hadrons, which then",

Finally, heavy quarks provide a unique probe for studies of the properties of the QCD matter created in Pb-Pb collisions at unprecedented high energies at the LHC (see e.g. [21,22]). Heavy-quark production rates in pp collisions provide the necessary baseline for such studies and motivates the measurement reported in this paper. We present the measurement of the production cross section of the prompt (B feeddown subtracted) charmed mesons D 0 , D + , and D * + , in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV in |y| < 0.5, reconstructed in the range 2 < p t < 12 GeV/c (1 < p t < 12 GeV/c for the D 0 ) with the ALICE experiment [23]. The apparatus is described in section 2, along with the data sample used for the measurement. The D meson analysis (reconstruction, signal extraction, corrections, systematic uncertainties) is presented in section 3. The p tdifferential cross sections are reported in section 4, and are compared to theoretical QCD calculations and to the ALICE measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV [13] scaled to \u221a s = 2.76 TeV by a pQCD-driven scaling [24]. In section 5, the visible cross sections at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV are extrapolated to the full phase space to calculate the fraction of cd D mesons produced in a vector state and the total cc production cross section at these two energies. The results are compared with existing measurements and predictions.",

In the following, the detectors utilized for the D meson analysis are discussed. A detailed description of the ALICE apparatus is given in ref. [23]. The central barrel detectors are contained in a large solenoidal magnet, which provides a magnetic field of 0.5 T along the beam direction. The closest detector to the beam axis (z) is the Inner Tracking System (ITS). It is made of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors with radii between 3.9 and 43.0 cm. The two innermost layers, with radii 3.9 cm (0.9 cm from the beam vacuum tube) and 7.6 cm, are equipped with Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD). The two intermediate layers (at radii of 15.0 and 23.9 cm) are made of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD). Finally the two outermost layers are equipped with Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD) and are located at radii of 38.0 and 43.0 cm. The total material budget of the ITS is on average 7.7% of a radiation length for charged particles crossing the ITS perpendicularly to the detector surfaces (\u03b7 = 0) [23,25]. The experiment's low magnetic field allows to track low p t hadrons (about 80 MeV/c for pions). In the present analysis, the main role of the ITS was to resolve the topology of the hadronic decays of the D mesons by identifying the secondary vertex of the decay. A particularity of the data sample collected in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV was that, in order to collect a higher statistics data sample, minimum-bias events were triggered independently of the SDD readout state. This resulted in a fraction of events missing the SDD information. To have a homogeneously reconstructed sample of tracks, the SDD points were always excluded from the track reconstruction used for this analysis. The ITS is surrounded by a 510 cm long cylindrical Time Projection Chamber (TPC) that covers |\u03b7| < 0.9 [26]. It provides track reconstruction with up to 159 points along",

The decays of D 0 and D + are weak processes with mean proper decay lengths c\u03c4 \u2248 123 and 312 \u00b5m. Their secondary decay vertices are then typically displaced by a few hundred \u00b5m from the primary interaction vertex. The analysis strategy for the D 0 and D + was based on the reconstruction and selection of secondary vertex topologies with significant separation from the primary vertex. The topological reconstruction of the decay allowed for an efficient rejection of the combinatorial background from uncorrelated tracks. The identification of the charged kaon using the TPC and the TOF detectors provided additional background rejection in the low-momentum region. Finally, the signal was extracted by an invariant mass analysis of the candidate pairs and triplets. In the D * + case, since the decay proceeds via the strong interaction, it is not possible to resolve the secondary D * + vertex. The analysis exploited the topological selection criteria applied in the D 0 meson analysis. The D * + signal was observed calculating the invariant-mass difference \u2206m = m D * + \u2212 m D 0 between the reconstructed D * + and the decay D 0 , as a narrow peak at \u2206m \u2248 145.4 MeV/c 2 close to the threshold and thus in a rather low combinatorial background region. Furthermore, the resolution in \u2206m is mostly defined by the pion momentum resolution.",

Secondary vertices of D 0 and D + meson candidates were reconstructed, with the same algorithm used to compute the primary vertex, from tracks having |\u03b7| < 0.8, p t > 0.3 GeV/c. Tracks were also required to have at least 70 space points (out of a maximum of 159) and \u03c7 2 /ndf < 2 in the TPC, and at least one hit in either of the two layers of the SPD. Only tracks compatible with a kaon or a pion were kept. The particle identification criteria consisted in a 3\u03c3 compatibility cut between the measured and expected signals, using the specific energy deposit and the time-of-flight from the TPC and TOF detectors, respectively. This conservative strategy was aimed at keeping \u223c 100% of the signal (see section 3.2). Exception was done for D 0 with p t < 2 GeV/c, where stricter requirements for the decay kaon identification in either the TPC or the TOF detectors were considered. These requirements were dependent on the track momentum. Tracks with no associated signal in the TOF detector were identified using only the TPC information.

The rapidity acceptance correction, using the factor 2 y fid , assumes that the rapidity distribution of D mesons is uniform in the range |y| < y fid . This assumption was verified using the PYTHIA 6.4.21 [29] event generator with Perugia-0 tune [30] and the FONLL pQCD calculation [8,9,31]. Both calculations generate a D meson yield that is uniform within 1% in the range |y| < 0.8. The efficiencies were calculated from a Monte Carlo simulation using the PYTHIA 6.4.21 [29] event generator with the Perugia-0 tune [30] and GEANT3 [32]. The LHC beam conditions and the apparatus configuration (inactive channels, noise, calibration, alignment) were considered taking into account their evolution with time. The acceptance correction was evaluated to account for the fiducial rapidity cut, y fid . A fraction of the reconstructed D mesons comes from B meson decays. Since these are characterized by a relatively long life time (B meson c\u03c4 \u2248 460-490 \u00b5m [33]), the decay tracks of D mesons from B decays are further displaced from the primary vertex, and the selection criteria enhance their relative contribution to the raw yields. Their contribution was evaluated using FONLL pQCD calculations [8,9,31] of the beauty production cross section and the B \u2192 D decay kinematics from the EvtGen package [34], with the procedure described in ref. [13], and was subtracted from the raw yields. The prompt fraction, f prompt , ranges within 88% to 98% depending on the D meson and p t interval. These FONLL pQCD calculations were chosen since they reproduce the Tevatron [2] and LHC [4,5] measurements discussed above. The corrected yields were then divided by a factor of two to obtain the averaged yield of the D mesons and their charge conjugates. They were finally normalized by their decay branching ratio, BR, and the sample integrated luminosity L int = 1.1 nb \u22121 [28].",

The systematic uncertainties from the yield extraction were JHEP07(2012)191 determined, in each p t interval, by studying the yield variation as obtained with a different background fit function (exponential, polynomial, linear) and by counting the signal in the candidates invariant mass range (\u00b13\u03c3) after subtracting the background (evaluated by fitting the distribution side bands). The yield extraction systematic uncertainties were set to one half of the full spread of the yield variation in each p t interval. The uncertainty on the single track efficiency was evaluated to be 5% (per track), by taking into account the influence of the track finding in the TPC, the prolongation from the TPC to ITS, and the track quality criteria. This was estimated by comparing the relative variation of the efficiency in data and simulations and by varying the track selection criteria. This track efficiency uncertainty results into an uncertainty of 10% for the two-body decay of D 0 mesons and of 15% for the three-body decay of D + and D * + mesons. The influence of the analysis cuts amounts to about 15%, and accounts for possible discrepancies of the D meson selection variables in data and simulations. The distributions of these variables in data, dominated by background candidates, and in simulations were compared and found to be compatible. The uncertainty was estimated by repeating the analysis with different sets of cuts and set to one half of the spread of the corrected yields. The uncertainty associated to the particle identification (PID) selections was studied by comparing the corrected invariant yields with and without PID. As the p t bins used in this analysis are finite and the transverse momentum distribution of the candidates is steep, the Monte Carlo p t shape could influence the acceptance and efficiency corrections per p t bin. These corrections were computed with different p t shapes (PYTHIA, FONLL, flat p t ) and their influence was found to be 3% for D meson with p t < 2 GeV/c, and of 1% for larger p t . The particle and anti-particle yields were evaluated independently per p t bin and found to be in agreement within statistical uncertainties (of about 30% for the D 0 analysis). The systematic uncertainty on the subtraction of the B feed-down contribution, explained in detail in ref. [13], accounts for the full variation of this correction considering either only the FONLL B feed-down prediction or the ratio of the prompt and B feed-down calculations, and includes the uncertainties of the theoretical calculations. Finally, the uncertainties of the correction for the D meson decay branching ratio (BR) and the luminosity (overall normalization) were evaluated as described above, and are presented in table 2.",

FONLL calculation varies the charm quark mass within 1.3 < m c < 1.7 GeV/c 2 while GM-VFNS assumes m c = 1.5 GeV/c 2 . The FONLL and GM-VFNS theoretical predictions are compatible with the measurements within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Nevertheless, it can be noted that the central prediction of FONLL tends to underestimate charm production whereas the central GM-VFNS calculation seems to overestimate it, as seen in the lower panels of figure 3. This behaviour is in accordance with our results on the prompt D 0 , D + , and D * + mesons p t -differential cross sections at \u221a s = 7 TeV [13].",

The argument of na\u00efve spin counting originates from heavy-quark effective theory assuming large enough heavy-quark masses, leading to a negligible effect due to the mass difference between D * + and D + . In the PYTHIA 6.4.21 [29] event generator the value for P v is set by an input parameter (PARJ(13)) with a default value of P Pythia v = 0.75. We note, that there is only one parameter defining the probability that a charm or heavier meson has spin 1. Calculations combining the Lund symmetric fragmentation function with exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficient coupling from the virtual quark-antiquark pair to the final hadron state functions predicts P Lund frag v \u2248 0.63 [43] in good agreement with data. We note that in this model, due to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient coupling, spin counting is automatic while differences in the hadron mass are taken into account in the fragmentation function by an exponential term. On the other hand, in the Statistical Model [20,21], the ratio of the total yields of the directly formed",

The results are: The dependence of the total nucleon-nucleon charm production cross section [14][15][16][46][47][48] on the collision energy is shown in figure 5 (right). The uncertainty boxes around the ATLAS [14,15] and ALICE [13] points denote the extrapolation uncertainties alone, whilst the uncertainty bars are the overall uncertainties. Note that in case of proton-nucleus (pA) or deuteron-nucleus (dA) collisions, the measured cross sections have been scaled down by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions calculated in a Glauber model of the proton-nucleus or the deuteron-nucleus collision geometry. At \u221a s = 7 TeV, our result and preliminary measurements by the ATLAS [14,15] and the LHCb Collaboration [16] are in fair agreement. The curves show the calculations at next-to-leading-order within the MNR framework [49] together with its uncertainties using the same parameters (and parameter uncertainties) mentioned before for FONLL. The dependence on the collision energy is described by pQCD calculations. We observe that all data points populate the upper band of the theoretical prediction.",

            "text": "The measurement of the production of D mesons at mid-rapidity, |y| < 0.5, in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV from the hadronic decay channels D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , and D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , and their charge conjugates, has been reported. The transverse momentum distributions are in agreement with pQCD calculations, even though the central prediction of FONLL [8,9,31] (GM-VFNS [6,7,35]) seems to underestimate (overestimate) charm production. The p t -differential cross sections are also in agreement with a rescaled reference computed from the cross section measured at a higher collision energy \u221a s = 7 TeV with high statistics. The rescaling to the lower collision energy [24] was performed by applying the collision energy dependence as computed by FONLL calculations. These two measurements, taken together, validate the \u221a s-scaling procedure and provide a reference for studying the QCD matter effects on charm quark production in Pb-Pb collisions at -14 -",
