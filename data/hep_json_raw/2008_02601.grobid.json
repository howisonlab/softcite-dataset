The pp collisions are generated at center of mass energies of \u221a s = 2.36, 7, 8, and 13 TeV, i.e. the energies at which the LHC has operated so far, using PYTHIA and HERWIG event generators. We have also studied the average of the maximum charged-particle density versus the event multiplicity for all events, using the different pseudorapidity windows. This study prepares for the multiparticle production background expected in a future search for anomalous high-density multiplicity fluctuations using the LHC data.",

While searching for physics beyond the Standard Model have been an intense study area using the LHC data, during the last 10 years, for hunting new particles or interactions, here we are interested in the potential to search for the production of anomalous high-density spikes\" of the number of particles produced in narrow pseudorapidity intervals. Events producing such anomalous particle clusters are called ring-like or spike events, 1 since the particles typically tend to be emitted with nearly equal polar angle but extend in the full azimuthal angular phase space region, hence they can form a ring of particles in a plane perpendicular to the axis of collision.",

They studied the distribution of events versus the maximum charged-particle density (n ch ) found in a rapidity window (\u2206y) = 0.1, and reported that the number of events (N ) decreases with increasing of n ch , following an approximate exponential dependence dN/dn ch = a exp(\u2212bn ch ). In addition to the smooth exponential decrease of the data, they observed a single outlying anomalous event with 10 charged particles within a very narrow rapidity window of \u2206y = 0.098, corresponding to a density of about 100 particles per unit of rapidity. This is a higher density than what was observed by the UA5 experiment, despite that the C.M. energy for the collisions at the UA5 is about 25 times larger. The anomalous event is reported to have an expectation probability of 10 \u22123 which calculated from the exponential fit to the data, and the cluster of tracks is located very centrally in the event, near rapidity (y) = 0. The 10 particles are very uniformly distributed in the azimuthal angle (\u03c6), and hence they don't show the typical characteristics of a mini-jet formation.",

Interestingly, in 2010, at the startup of the LHC at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, when the first pp collisions at C.M. energy of 7 TeV were produced, the highest energy produced in the laboratory at that time, unexpected correlations were observed in minimum bias and high multiplicity events by the CMS experiment which were until then thought to be only produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions 17 and until then had been linked to the possible formation of QGP. The same intriguing phenomenon was subsequently observed by all LHC central detectors and with data at a higher energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV (e.g. for CMS see Ref. 18 ). This was a very surprising result and so far has not been fully understood.

            "text": "The event generation for both generators consists of several steps starting typically from a hard scattering process, followed by initial-and final-state parton showering, multi-parton interactions, and the final hadronization process. HER-WIG and PYTHIA use different model approaches for these steps, e.g. PYTHIA uses a p T -ordered approach 21 for modeling of parton shower while HERWIG deploys angular-ordered showers. 22 Multi-parton scattering in PYTHIA uses the original impact parameter model 23 while HERWIG applies the eikonal multiple partonic scattering model. 24 The last step is the hadronization (fragmentation) of partons into hadrons; this process is performed in PYTHIA with the Lund string fragmentation model 25,26 and an alternative model used by HERWIG is based on cluster fragmentation. 27 Both Monte Carlo programs include a model to generate soft Study of charged-particle multiplicity fluctuations in pp collisions 5 hadronic collisions which make up the largest part of a sample of minimum bias events. Note also that, the minimum bias events contain not only soft events but a mix of all event classes produced in the pp interactions according to their relative cross-sections.",

This is not unexpected and, in most part, due to the different hadronization model used in these two Monte Carlo programs.Similar distributions for high multiplicity selected events are shown inFigs. 2.(a,c,e) for PYTHIA and HERWIG at \u221a s =2.36 and 7 TeV respectively, andFigs. 2.(b,d,f)are for \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV. It is interesting to notice that the effect of the 100 MeV p T cut-off in the collider experiments does not have a significant impact on this measurement as expected by PYTHIA and still small but slightly larger as expected by HERWIG. The influence of the p T cut predicted by PYTHIA is shown inFig. 3, which compares the distributions with and without the p T > 100 MeV cut, at C.M. energy of 13 TeV and \u2206\u03b7 = 0.1.",

Figs. 1.(b,d,f) show the same distributions for collision energies 8 and 13 TeV. All figuresshow, for a minimum of two particles, the expected number of events is decreasing with increasing of n ch for n ch > 5, and the width of the distributions increases with increasing of the C.M. energy: for higher energies larger values of n ch are reached, as expected. For all energies, the relative number of events with large density produced by PYTHIA is slightly higher than the events produced by HERWIG. In fact, the ratio of the PYTHIA to HERWIG dN/dn ch distribution shows that the ratio is fairly constant up to n ch is 5 (10) for the search with \u2206\u03b7 = 0.1 (0.5) but rises to a value of 2-4 at the highest densities.
