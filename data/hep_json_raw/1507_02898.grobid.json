The data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, collected with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The analyses pursue different inclusive search strategies. One analysis requires at least one photon, at least two jets, and a large amount of transverse momentum imbalance, while the other selects events with at least two photons and at least one jet, and uses the razor variables to search for signal events. The background expected from standard model processes is evaluated mainly from data. The results are interpreted in the context of general gaugemediated supersymmetry, with the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle either a bino-or wino-like neutralino, and within simplified model scenarios. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are obtained for cross sections as functions of the masses of the intermediate supersymmetric particles.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] is a popular extension of the standard model, which offers a solution to the hierarchy problem [8] by introducing a supersymmetric partner for each standard model particle. In models with conserved R-parity [9,10], as are considered here, SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. If the LSP is weakly interacting, it escapes without detection, resulting in events with an imbalanc\u1ebd p miss T in transverse momentum. Models of SUSY with gauge-mediated symmetry breaking [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] predict that the gravitino (G) is the LSP. If the next-to-lightest SUSY particle is a neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) with a bino or wino component, photons with large transverse momenta (p T ) may be produced in\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3G decays. The event contains jets if the\u03c7 0 1 originates from the cascade decay of a strongly coupled SUSY particle (a squark or a gluino).",

The discriminating variables are E miss T for the single-photon analysis, and the razor variables M R and R 2 [18,19] for the double-photon analysis, where E miss T is the magnitude of p miss T .

No evidence for a signal was found, and models with production cross sections larger than \u224810 fb \u22121 were excluded in the context of general gauge-mediation (GGM) SUSY scenarios [24][25][26][27][28][29]. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the CMS detector, in Sec. III the benchmark signal models, and in Sec. IV the part of the event reconstruction strategy that is common to the two analyses. The specific aspects of the single-and double-photon searches are discussed in Secs. V and VI, respectively. The results of the analyses are presented in Sec. VIII. A summary is given in Sec. IX.",

IV. If a jet (possibly including the photon) is reconstructed within \u0394R < 0.2 of the photon candidate and the p T value of the jet is less than 3 times that of the photon candidate itself, it is referred to as the \"photon jet.\" If such a jet is found, p \u00c3 T is defined as the p T value of the photon jet. Otherwise, p \u00c3 T is the p T value of the photon candidate. We require photon candidates to satisfy p \u00c3 T > 110 GeV and j\u03b7j < 1.44. Also, in the subsequent analysis, we make use of the variable H \u00c3 T , defined as for H T in the previous paragraph but including the p \u00c3 T values of all selected photon candidates.

We require events to satisfy H \u00c3 T \u2265 500 GeV. The sample of events with isolated photons so selected is referred to as the \u03b3 tight sample.

This class of events contains both genuine photons and spurious photon candidates from jets. This is by far the largest contribution to the background. (ii) events with genuine E miss T originating from the leptonic decay of W bosons, both directly produced and originating from top quark decays, which we refer to as electroweak (EW) background. (iii) rare processes with initial-or final-state photon radiation (ISR/FSR), such as \u03b3W, \u03b3Z (especially \u03b3Z \u2192 \u03b3\u03bd\u03bd), and \u03b3tt production. The kinematic properties of the multijet background are estimated from a control sample of photon candidates with isolation-variable values (I \u03c0 , I n , I \u03b3 ) too large to satisfy the signal photon selection. We refer to these events as the \u03b3 loose sample. Photon candidates of this kind typically originate from jets with anomalous fractions of energy deposited in the ECAL. Other than the orthogonal requirement of a \u03b3 loose rather than a \u03b3 tight candidate, events in this control sample are selected with the same requirements as the \u03b3 tight sample, as summarized in Table I. Despite the different isolation requirement, this sample has properties similar to those of the \u03b3 tight sample, due to the use of p \u00c3 T rather than photon p T in the definition of the event kinematic variables. Moreover, events in the \u03b3 loose control sample are corrected for a residual difference with respect to the \u03b3 tight sample in the distributions of p \u00c3 T and hadronic recoil p T , estimated from events with E miss T < 100 GeV. The corrected distribution of a given kinematic property (e.g., E miss T ) for \u03b3 loose events provides an estimate of the corresponding distribution for \u03b3 tight events. The uncertainty in the correction factors, propagated to the prediction, is fully correlated among bins in the signal region and is treated as a systematic uncertainty in the background yield. The limited statistical precision of the control sample dominates the total systematic uncertainty. Figure 2 (left) shows the E miss T distribution from the \u03b3 tight sample and the corresponding prediction from the \u03b3 loose sample, for simulated multijet and \u03b3 \u00fe jet events. No discrepancy is observed within the quoted uncertainties.",

The single-photon search characterizes a potential signal as an excess in the tail of the E miss T spectrum beyond 100 GeV, while the double-photon search exploits the razor variables M R and R 2 . These searches are based on pp collision data collected with the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . No evidence for supersymmetry production is found, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the production cross sections, in the context of simplified models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking and general gauge-mediation (GGM) models. Lower limits from the double-photon razor analysis range beyond 1.3 TeV for the gluino mass and beyond 1.5 TeV for the squark mass for bino-like neutralino mixings in the studied GGM phase space, extending previous limits [23] by up to 300 and 500 GeV, respectively. The limits from the singlephoton analysis for wino-like neutralino mixings range beyond 0.8 TeV for the gluino mass and 1 TeV for the squark mass in the same GGM phase space, extending previous limits by about 100 and 200 GeV. Within the discussed supersymmetry scenarios, these results represent the current most stringent limits.",
