The fiducial cross sections for ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + and ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd are measured in selected phase-space regions. The total cross section for ZZ events produced with both Z bosons in the mass range 66 to 116 GeV is measured from the combination of the two channels to be 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 (stat) \u00b1 0.3 (syst) \u22120.2 \u22120.1 (lumi) pb, which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of 6.6 +0.7 \u22120.6 pb. The differential cross sections in bins of various kinematic variables are presented. The differential event yield as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading Z boson is used to set limits on anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings in ZZ production.",

            "text": "The production of electroweak gauge boson pairs provides an opportunity to perform precision studies of the electroweak sector by looking for deviations from the predicted total and differential production cross sections, which could be an indication of new resonances or couplings not included in the Standard Model (SM). Pairs of Z bosons may be produced at lowest order via quark-antiquark (qq) annihilation, as well as through gluon-gluon fusion via a quark loop. In \u221a s = TeV proton-proton (pp) collisions, approximately 6% of the predicted total cross section is due to gluon-gluon fusion [1]. A pair of Z bosons may also be produced by the decay of a Higgs boson. Lowest-order Feynman diagrams for SM production of ZZ dibosons are given in figures 1a, 1b and 1d to 1f. These represent the dominant mechanisms for ZZ diboson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The self-couplings of the electroweak gauge bosons are fixed by the form of the SM Lagrangian. Consequently, neutral triple gauge couplings such as ZZZ and ZZ\u03b3 are not present in the SM, making the contribution from the s-channel diagram zero (figure 1c).",

            "text": "Many extensions to the SM predict new scalar, vector, or tensor particles, which can decay to pairs of electroweak bosons. For example, diboson resonances are predicted in technicolour models [2][3][4][5], models with warped extra dimensions [6][7][8], extended gauge models [9,10], and grand unified theories [11]. Furthermore, extensions to the SM such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions predict new particles, which can either produce boson pairs directly, in cascade decays, or indirectly via loops. At higher orders, loop contributions involving new particles can lead to effective anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings (aTGCs) as large as 10 \u22123 [12]. Any significant deviation in the observed production cross section relative to the SM predictions can indicate a potential source of new physics. Thus, ZZ production is important not only for precision tests of the electroweak sector and pQCD, but also for searches for new physics processes.",

            "text": "This paper presents measurements of the fiducial, total and differential cross sections for ZZ production in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV using 20.3 fb \u22121 of data. These have been measured by both the ATLAS [13] and CMS [14] Collaborations at 7 TeV. Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration has measured the fiducial and total cross section for ZZ production at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV [15] and the cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the four-lepton system at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV [16]. The CMS Collaboration has recently measured the ZZ production cross section at 8 TeV [17]. This paper also presents limits on ZZZ and ZZ\u03b3 aTGCs within the context of an effective Lagrangian framework [18]. The limits obtained by both ATLAS [13] and CMS [14] using the full 7 TeV data sets are approximately 10 to 20 times stricter than limits set at LEP2 [19] and the Tevatron [20]. More recently, limits on aTGCs have been set by the JHEP01(2017)099 CMS Collaboration using the full 8 TeV data set of 19.6 fb \u22121 in the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + channel ( = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ) [17]. CMS has also measured the ZZ production cross section using the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd decay mode and set limits on aTGCs using the combination of 5 fb \u22121 of data at 7 TeV and 19.6 fb \u22121 of data at 8 TeV [21]. The paper is organized as follows. An overview of the ATLAS detector is given in section 2. Section 3 defines the phase space in which the cross sections are measured, while section 4 gives the SM predictions. The simulated signal and background samples used for this analysis are given in section 5. Data samples, reconstruction of leptons, jets and E miss T , and event selection for each final state are presented in section 6. The estimation of background contributions to the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + and ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd channels, using a combination of simulation-based and data-driven techniques, is discussed in section 7. The observed and expected event yields are presented in section 8, while section 9 describes the correction factors and detector acceptance for this measurement. Section 10 describes the experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties considered. Section 11 presents the results of the total and differential cross-section measurements. Limits on aTGCs are discussed in section 12 in the context of an effective Lagrangian framework. Finally, section 13 presents the conclusions.",

For the Powheg-Box contribution, a scale uncertainty of +3.1% \u22122.3% [32] is included. For the gluon-gluon fusion contribution, recent publications [33][34][35] suggest an increase of the ZZ production cross section by up to a factor of about two, when the calculation is performed at higher orders in QCD. This calculation is sensitive to the choice of PDF set and even more to the \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F scales. As this correction is not available differentially for all distributions and all final states analysed in this paper, no reweighting is applied to the prediction of gg2VV. In order to account for these higher-order QCD effects, the scale uncertainty for gg2VV is set JHEP01(2017)099 to \u00b160%. PDF and scale uncertainties are added linearly following the recommendation of ref. [36]. The jet veto uncertainty obtained using the Stewart and Tackmann method [37] is shown in table 8 and is added in quadrature to the systematic uncertainty of the fiducial cross sections for each ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd final state. This method uses samples for ZZ and Z production when varying the QCD scale to estimate the uncertainty associated with selecting events with zero jets by examining the uncertainty for selecting events with one or more jets. This approach is conservative and it covers further uncertainties from higher-order QCD effects.",

Events with a forward electron have the additional requirement that the central electron that is paired with the forward electron must have a transverse momentum of at least 20 GeV instead of 7 GeV.",

The leptons of background events in the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + channel can either be \"true\" leptons from the decays of Z bosons, W \u00b1 bosons, or top quarks or they can be \"fake\" leptons that are defined as jets which are misidentified as leptons or leptons that come from hadronic decays. Background events in which all four leptons are true leptons are called the \"irreducible background\" as these events have the same signature as -9 - the signal events in this channel. In the SM, there are few final states with significant cross sections that can produce four true leptons. The largest sources of irreducible backgrounds are ttZ and ZZZ * /ZW W * production and events with DPI that separately produce Z bosons that each decay to two leptons. The contributions from each of these background sources are estimated from MC simulations that have been scaled to 20.3 fb \u22121 and can be found in table 3. The systematic uncertainty for the irreducible background is neglected. The cross sections for these processes are much smaller than for the signal, and their overall contribution to the total background is small. Background events containing one or more fake leptons, constitute the \"reducible background\". The dominant reducible background contributions to ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + production are Z + jets, W W + jets, and top quark (tt and single-top quark) events in which two prompt leptons are paired with two jets or leptons from a heavy-flavour decay which are misidentified as isolated leptons. Additional background arises from W Z+jets events containing three true leptons and one fake lepton. To estimate backgrounds containing fake leptons, the data-driven method employed in the ATLAS measurement at 7 TeV [13] is used and only a summary of the relevant parameters is given here.",

A fiducial cross section is extracted for every final state in both the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + and ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd channels. The information from these final states is combined to measure a single pp \u2192 ZZ total cross section in the total phase space (66 < m \u2212 + < 116 GeV) using the detector acceptance and branching fraction of ZZ to a given four-lepton or dilepton + \u03bd\u03bd final state. For each measurement, a likelihood method is used to extract the expected ZZ event rate according to a Poisson probability distribution, as described in ref. [68]. The likelihood is maximized with respect to the cross section. For fiducial (total) cross-section measurements, sources of systematic uncertainties affecting backgrounds, object reconstruction and identification efficiencies, detector acceptance and luminosity are included as nuisance parameters and the affected terms are allowed to fluctuate according to Gaussian probability distributions with widths equal to the uncertainties. The measured cross sections for the ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 + and ZZ \u2192 \u2212 + \u03bd\u03bd channels are given in table 9 and the ratios of these measurements with respect to the SM predictions are shown in figure 5.",

The unfolding algorithm combines the measured spectrum with the response matrix to form a likelihood, takes as input a prior for the specific kinematic variable and iterates using the posterior distribution as prior for the next iteration. The SM prediction calculated using the PowhegBox and gg2VV generators is used as the initial prior and three iterations are performed.

The ZZV couplings in ZZ production considered here are distinct from the Z\u03b3V couplings probed in Z\u03b3 production in e \u2212 e + and hadronic collisions. Additional anomalous couplings can contribute when the Z bosons are off-shell [76], although these couplings are highly suppressed near the Z boson resonance.",

Simulated samples are produced using a generator which contains matrix elements with aTGCs at various strengths with one reference sample generated at the SM points of zero for all couplings, and at least two other samples with non-zero couplings in various combinations. The signal yield is obtained as the simulated samples are reweighted from one aTGC point to another using a framework [77] which allows the kinematic properties to be reweighted on an event-by-event basis. The matrix elements used for reweighting are extracted from the Baur, Han and Ohnemus (BHO) [78] generator. The event yields are then expressed as a function of the aTGC parameters, which contains terms both linearly and quadratically proportional to the couplings. The expected number of events generated by Sherpa (only qq \u2192 ZZ) is then normalized to the prediction of PowhegBox + gg2VV.",
