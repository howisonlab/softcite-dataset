The diphoton final state provides a clean experimental signature with excellent invariantmass resolution and moderate backgrounds. This Letter presents an update of the searches for new high-mass states decaying into two photons, using both 2015 and 2016 proton-proton (pp) collision datasets recorded at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb \u22121 . The analysis closely follows that described in Ref. [1], and includes small improvements in the photon reconstruction, selection and energy calibration. From the many extensions of the SM that predict new high-mass resonances decaying into two photons, the two benchmark signal models studied in Ref. [1] are considered: a spin-0 resonance ( X ) as predicted in theories with an extended Higgs sector [2][3][4][5][6][7][8], and the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) [9] spin-2 graviton excitation (G * ) of a Randall-Sundrum [10] model with one warped extra dimension, later referred to as RS1. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported a modest excess in the diphoton invariant-mass spectra with respect to the SM continuum background near a mass value of 750 GeV [1,11], using 3.2-3.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded in 2015 at the LHC. The ATLAS result corresponds to a global significance of 2.1 standard deviations (\u03c3 ).",

In addition to searching for a resonant signal, data are interpreted using the model proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali (ADD) [13]. Motivated by the weakness of gravity, the ADD model predicts the existence of n extra dimensions of spacetime where only gravity can propagate. If the ultraviolet cutoff scale (M S ) of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum is lower than the Planck scale in the (4 + n)-dimensional space-time, the extra dimensions may be detected via virtual KK graviton exchange before being observed via direct KK graviton emission. The strength of gravity in the presence of extra dimensions is typically parameterized by",

Several theoretical formalisms exist in the literature [14][15][16]. While the definition of \u03b7 G is consistent, each formalism uses a different convention for F , which consequently leads to a different definition of M S . The KK graviton exchange creates a set of finely spaced resonances, which manifests itself as a non-resonant deviation from the expected SM background in the diphoton mass distribution due to limited experimental resolution. The effective diphoton cross section is the result of the SM and ADD amplitudes, as well as their interference. The interference term in the effective cross section is linear in \u03b7 G and the pure KK graviton exchange term is quadratic in \u03b7 G .",

The ID consists of fine-granularity silicon pixel and microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 complemented by a gas-filled straw-tube transition radiation tracker (TRT) at larger radii which covers the region |\u03b7| < 2.0 and provides electron identification capabilities. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a lead/liquidargon sampling calorimeter with accordion geometry. It is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end-cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5, it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. A thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in upstream energy losses. Hadronic calorimetry in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers and scintillator tiles as the active medium. Liquid-argon calorimetry with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A forward calorimeter using copper and tungsten absorbers with liquid argon completes the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer, located beyond the calorimeters, consists of three large air-core superconducting toroid systems with precision tracking chambers providing accurate muon tracking for |\u03b7| < 2.7 and fast detectors for triggering for |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

Compared to the processing used in Ref.

For an average number of interactions per bunch crossing close to 40, the re-optimized algorithm maintains the same reconstruction efficiency for genuine photon conversions, while the rate of unconverted photons reconstructed as converted is reduced from around 20% to around 5%. In addition, a small bias in the track parameters was corrected. These changes lead to small event-by-event differences between the two reconstructions in the classification of the photons as either converted or unconverted.",

The uncertainty in the photon energy scale for E T > 100 GeV is typically 0.5-1.5% depending on \u03b7. The uncertainty in the photon energy resolution is driven by the uncertainty in the constant term in the E T range relevant to this analysis.

The 2\u00d72D sideband method and the matrix method are based on sidebands constructed by inverting photon identification and isolation requirements. The results from these two methods are in good agreement as shown in Fig. 1. The selected samples consist mainly of events from diphoton production, with a purity estimated by the 2\u00d72D sideband method to be (91 +3 \u22127 )% for the spin-0 selection and (91 +3 \u22128 )% for the spin-2 selection, increasing by a few percent with m \u03b3 \u03b3 . Uncertainties in these purity estimates originate from the statistical uncertainty in the data sample, the definition of the control region failing the tight identification requirement, the event generator dependence (difference between Sherpa 2.2.1 and Pythia8), the modelling of the isolation and shower-shape distributions, and possible correlations between the isolation variables and the inverted identification criteria. The remaining background is mostly composed of photon+jet and dijet production, with one or two jets misidentified as photons. Backgrounds from other sources are negligible. The composition derived from the 2\u00d72D sideband method is used to select the function to model the background in the spin-0 resonance search. In the background estimate used for the spin-2 resonance and non-resonant signal searches, the composition of the data sample is determined by a third method, which exploits the isolation profile of the two photons in the calorimeter, with consistent results obtained for the spin-2 selection as mentioned above.",

The detector resolution is modelled by a double-sided Crystal Ball (DSCB) function, composed of a Gaussian core with power-law tails [1]. The line-shape at the particle level for each signal model is taken to be the product of the analytic differential cross-section expression for particle production and decay to photons, and a parametrised form of the parton luminosity. The signal model is in good agreement with invariant-mass distributions from simulated signal samples introduced in Section 3 with corresponding values of resonance mass and width (k/M Pl ) for the spin-0 (spin-2) case. Potential differences in the tails between the signal model and the simulation are found to have negligible impact on the extracted signal yield.

For mass-dependent uncertainties, the quoted mass ranges cover 200 GeV (500 GeV) until 2700 GeV for the spin-0 (spin-2) resonance search. In the spin-2 searches the PDF uncertainty in the irreducible background component dominates the total uncertainty beyond 2700 GeV, rising to 130% at 5000 GeV. distributions from MC simulations, within the uncertainties in the measured background composition and PDF set. The potential bias due to the choice of the functional form is estimated by the fitted signal yield (\"spurious signal\") in these background distributions, and is considered as a systematic uncertainty. The spurious signal is required to be less than 30% of the statistical uncertainty in the fitted signal yield (from the background distributions) over most of the investigated mass range. Below 400 GeV, where the statistical uncertainty in the MC sample used to determine the spurious signal uncertainty is comparable to the maximum spurious signal allowed, the criterion is relaxed to 50%. In the spin-2 resonance search and also in the non-resonant signal search, both of which target KK graviton signals at the TeV scale, the small number of data events at high m \u03b3 \u03b3 values does not effectively constrain the invariant-mass distribution of the background. The shape of the distribution of the irreducible diphoton background is thus predicted using the Diphox [44] computation at NLO in QCD, which is found to be in good agreement with the predictions from Sherpa version 2.2.2 [45] using the same order in QCD. The background from photon+jet and dijet events is added using control samples from the data with the same method as discussed in Ref. [1]. An alternative method, based on the rate of jets misidentified as photons extracted from inclusive photon data and applied to similar control samples, gives compatible results. The different background components are combined according to the decomposition studies in data reported in Section 4 for the m \u03b3 \u03b3 distribution of the total background. The normalization of the background is a free parameter in the maximum-likelihood fit to the data spectrum. Uncertainty in the total background's shape results from uncertainties in both the shape and the relative normalization of each component [1], including the shape of the reducible background, the relative normalization of the reducible and irreducible backgrounds, the impact of the parton-level isolation requirement in Diphox, and the effect of the uncertainties in the scales and PDF set used in the Diphox computation. These un-certainties are taken to be correlated across the entire mass range. Statistical uncertainties in the simulated samples are also considered in each bin. The uncertainty from the parton-level isolation requirement in Diphox is constrained by the low-mass sideband of the data m \u03b3 \u03b3 spectrum in the maximum-likelihood fit, and thus reduces to about 1% across most of the mass range.",

Fig. 4(b) shows the limits on the KK graviton cross section times branching ratio to two photons as a function of the resonance mass with k/M Pl = 0.1. The cross sections predicted by the benchmark model are computed at LO in QCD using Pythia8, and are shown on the same figure. The uncertainty band on the predictions represents the PDF uncertainty estimated from the variations of the NNPDF23LO PDF set. The observed limits on the cross section times branching ratio range from 4.6 fb to about 0.1 fb for a KK graviton mass between 500 GeV and 5000 GeV. The RS1 model with k/M Pl = 0.1 is excluded for m G * below 4.1 TeV, based on the observed limit determined with pseudo-experiments. The impact of systematic uncertainties on the expected limit is below 5% over the entire mass range, and typically 2-3% below 2 TeV. The spin-2 spectrum shown in Fig. 2(b) is also interpreted in the context of the ADD model. A counting experiment is performed in the signal region m \u03b3 \u03b3 > 2240 GeV. In this region, four events are observed in data for 4.3 \u00b1 1.0 expected. The expected 95% CL upper limit on the number of excess events is 5.4, and the observed limit has the same value. The limit on the number of events can be translated into a lower limit on the ultraviolet cutoff scale M S in the ADD model for different theoretical formalisms as summarized in Table 3. Besides the GRW formalism used for the simulation, the Han-Lykken-Zhang (HLZ) [15] formalism and the Hewett [16] formalism with positive interference are also considered. A K-factor of about 1.4 was computed using ADD samples generated at LO and NLO using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, and is included in the results to indicate the potential impact from the higher-order calculation.

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The transverse energy is defined as E T = E sin(\u03b8 ).",
