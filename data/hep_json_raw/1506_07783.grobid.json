            "text": "It is widely believed that strong interactions are governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which implies that the structure of both atomic nuclei and their constituent nucleons are fully described by the interactions of quarks and gluons. However, at separation distances typically found between the nucleons within an atomic nucleus (\u223c1 fm), color confinement suggests that the interactions between nucleons can be described by the exchange of colorless particles. Effective theories based on the interactions between nucleons and mesons can therefore be constructed to describe nuclear structure, and such interactions can be directly probed by experiments that study the scattering of pions off of atomic nuclei.",

            "text": "Over the past forty years, an extensive set of pion scattering experiments have been conducted at various meson factories, such as the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) in the United States, the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland, and the TRIUMF laboratory in Canada . Although these data have provided very detailed measurements of differential cross sections for a variety of final-state kinematic variables, the uncertainties on the inclusive cross sections for processes such as pion absorption and charge exchange (see Fig. 1) range from 10% to 30% for light nuclei, such as carbon and oxygen. Of particular interest are pion absorption measurements, in which an incident \u03c0 + interaction fails to produce a pion in the final state. Since a pion cannot be absorbed by a nucleon in a manner that conserves energy and momentum, absorption interactions must involve coupled states of at least two nucleons. Pion absorption measurements therefore provide unique insight into nuclear structure by directly probing the correlations between component nucleons.",

            "text": "Beyond intrinsic theoretical interest in nuclear structure, pion interactions can play a critical role in understanding systematic uncertainties in experiments conducted at the GeV energy scale. One such field that is sensitive to pioncross-section uncertainties is the study of neutrinos. When a neutrino interacts with an atomic nucleus via a charged current interaction, a charge lepton is produced. In experiments studying the interactions of neutrinos with incident energy around 1 GeV, the energy of the neutrino is typically inferred from the measured kinematics of the outgoing lepton and the assumed recoil mass of the target nucleon. Around this energy, the cross section for neutrino-induced pion production is large. If pions are produced but not detected due to interactions within the target nucleus or after exiting the nucleus, the inferred neutrino energy will be biased. Pions with momenta of a few hundred MeV/c interact primarily in three modes as shown in Fig. 1: (1) Hadronic scattering through inelastic (quasi-elastic) and elastic channels (SCAT), (2) absorption (ABS), and (3) charge exchange (CX). Interactions in which a \u03c0 \u00b1 does not produce a \u03c0 \u00b1 , such as pion absorption and charge exchange interactions, can be particularly challenging to reconstruct, since low-energy nucleons and photons from \u03c0 0 decay can be difficult to detect. The contribution of double-charge-exchange interactions is small for light nuclei.",

In order to identify the scattered pion track which is reconstructed only in U or V projection, the dQ/dx cut is also applied for the 2D tracks. For the 2D tracks, the dQ/dx is calculated by using the track length projected onto 2D, which is shorter than the actual 3D track length. Therefore, dQ/dx is overestimated for 2D tracks.

Also, due to finite dQ/dx resolution, pion tracks are sometimes misidentified as protons. These background events pass the event selection. Although the cross section of pion elastic scattering in the MC is tuned to results from previous experiments, a linear interpolation of the data points from the previous measurements does not perfectly reproduce the actual cross section. The estimation of the uncertainty for the number of predicted background events is described in Sec. V A 9.",

The inclusive \u03c0 + -C inelastic scattering, ABS, and CX cross sections were also tuned. Figures 16 and 17 shows the comparison of the cross sections between the previous experiments and the default GEANT4 MC data, for elastic and inelastic processes. There are disagreements between GEANT4 cross section (ver9.4, QGSP-BERT) and the measurements from the previous experiments, especially for \u03c0 -H elastic scattering process. Table IV summarizes the data from previous experiments that we used for the tuning. The momentum of pions after inelastic scattering is predicted by using the NEUT cascade model [31] because there are no available data. Figures 18 and 19 shows the number of tracks and angular distribution for the reconstructed tracks before and after the tuning, for the p \u03c0 = 237.2 MeV/c data set. The No final \u03c0 + cut is not applied for these plots. The forward-angle multipletrack events increased after the tuning, mainly due to the increase of \u03c0 -H elastic cross section. The agreement between data and MC is much better with the tuning, although there are still small disagreements because the linear interpolation does not perfectly reproduce the data. The difference between data and MC is included in the systematic error. Figure 20 shows the angular distribution of the reconstructed tracks before and after applying the No final \u03c0 + cut, for 201.6, 237.2, 295.1 MeV/c data sets. In case there are multiple tracks in the final state, only the track with the smallest value of dQ/dx is selected to fill the histograms in these plots. Figure 21 shows the number of tracks distribution before and after applying the No final \u03c0 + cut. After applying the No final \u03c0 + cut, the fraction of ABS and CX events increase, and the agreement between data and MC becomes worse. This is expected because the kinematics of the final-state particles for ABS and CX interactions is not tuned. The event selection efficiency is affected by this difference, so it is taken into account in the systematic error.",

When a backward-going (\u03b8 > 160 \u2022 ) proton track exists, the incident track may not be identified because it overlaps with the proton track. Therefore, the event selection efficiency is affected by the fraction of ABS and CX events associated with forward and backward proton tracks. Figure 22 shows the angular distributions for backwardgoing proton-like tracks for data and MC with p \u03c0 = 237.2 MeV/c setting.

In the case of forward-going proton-like tracks the data is found to be 1.3 times larger in the region below \u03b8 < 20 \u2022 . The effect of this difference to the event selection efficiency is estimated by using a reweighted MC sample in which the fraction of events with a forward-or backward-going proton track is increased to reproduce the data. Figure 23 shows the angular distribution of proton-like tracks for nominal and reweighted MC. The event selection efficiency is compared between nominal and the reweighted MC, and the difference is assigned as a systematic error.

The probability to misidentify a proton track as a pion track is estimated from the probability to pass dQ/dx cut in one projection (U or V) but not in the other projection. As mentioned in Sec. III B, dQ/dx is calculated from U or V projection and not from both projections to minimize the effect of saturation of the electronics. Figure 24 shows an example of the dQ/dx distribution in one projection, when dQ/dx is required to be above threshold in the other projection. The probability to pass the dQ/dx cut in one projection but not in the other projection is compared between data and MC. For example, in Figure 24, the fraction of events below the threshold is 5% for data, while it is 4% for MC. Therefore, 25% error is applied for the number of ABS and CX events with proton-like tracks reconstructed in this angular region and at this momentum. Although this error is not small, the effect on the total cross section is not significantly large because the efficiency of the dQ/dx cut is large (\u223c90%) and the number of ABS or CX events which do not pass this cut is small.",
