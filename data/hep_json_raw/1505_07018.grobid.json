The search is performed with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. The lepton-plus-jets final state is used, where the top pair decays to W + bW \u2212b , with one W boson decaying leptonically and the other hadronically. The invariant mass spectrum of top quark pairs is examined for local excesses or deficits that are inconsistent with the Standard Model predictions. No evidence for a top quark pair resonance is found, and 95% confidence-level limits on the production rate are determined for massive states in benchmark models. The upper limits on the cross-section times branching ratio of a narrow Z boson decaying to top pairs range from 4.2 pb to 0.03 pb for resonance masses from 0.4 TeV to 3.0 TeV. A narrow leptophobic topcolour Z boson with mass below 1.8 TeV is excluded. Upper limits are set on the cross-section times branching ratio for a broad colour-octet resonance with \u0393/m = 15% decaying to tt. These range from 4.8 pb to 0.03 pb for masses from 0.4 TeV to 3.0 TeV. A Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon in a Randall-Sundrum model is excluded for masses below 2.2 TeV.",

At least one of the hadronic jets is required to be consistent with having originated from a b-quark. An estimator of the tt invariant mass (m reco tt ) is constructed with the events divided into two orthogonal classes by topology: the boosted topology, where the decay products of the hadronically decaying top quark are expected to be fully enclosed within one large-radius jet, and the resolved topology where four smallradius jets are reconstructed and attributed to the bbqq quarks. The m reco tt spectrum is scanned for localised deviations relative to the expectations from the background processes. The compatibility of the data and expectations is assessed, and limits on the production cross-section for new particles are set.",

The benchmark models adopted in this search include colour-singlet and colour-octet bosons with spin 0, 1 and 2 and masses from 0.4 to 3 TeV. The resonance width for the specific models varies from very narrow (1%) to a size similar to that of the experimental resolution (15%). Furthermore, the dependence of the limits on the resonance width is explored for heavy gluons up to a width of 40%.

Specifically, heavy Kaluza-Klein gluons, g KK , as produced in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models with a single warped extra dimension [30], are used as a benchmark in this search. In this model, the g KK has a nominal width of 15.3% of its mass. Previous searches using \u221a s = 7 TeV ATLAS data [16] exclude a g KK with a mass less than 2.1 TeV. The CMS Collaboration searched for similar resonances [18], using a slightly different benchmark model [31]. The CMS choice leads to a larger natural width of 20% and a larger production cross-section, and, for such a scenario, CMS excludes the existence of a g KK with mass less than 2.5 TeV. In the analysis presented here, the sensitivity to the width of the colour octet is also tested for widths from 10% to 40% of the resonance mass.",

The search uses a Randall-Sundrum model with extra dimensions where the SM fields are in the warped bulk and the fermions are localised appropriately to explain the flavour structure of the SM [12,32,33]. This kind of graviton is commonly referred to as a \"Bulk\" RS graviton and is characterised by a dimensionless coupling constant k/M Pl \u223c 1, where k is the curvature of the warped extra dimension andM Pl = M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass. For such gravitons, decays to light fermions are suppressed, and the branching ratio to photons is negligible. The branching ratios to tt, W W , ZZ and HH are significant. In the model used, k/M Pl is chosen to be 1, and the G KK width varies from 3% to 6% in the mass range 400-2000 GeV. The branching ratio of G KK decay into a tt pair rapidly increases from 18% to -3 -",

Lepton-plus-jets events were collected using single-electron and single-muon triggers with thresholds chosen in each case such that the efficiency is uniform for leptons satisfying offline selections including transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV. The ATLAS muon trigger system suffers from a 20% inefficiency, relative to the offline event selection used in this analysis, largely due to a lack of geometrical coverage by muon chambers owing to support structures in those regions [37]. To mitigate this loss of efficiency, a large-radius-jet trigger, which triggers on anti-k t jets (see section 5) with radius parameter R = 1.0, was used to collect muon-plus-jets events which failed the muon trigger. This large-radius-jet trigger recorded 17.4 fb \u22121 data. The chosen trigger threshold yields a uniform efficiency exceeding 99% for events containing a large-radius jet with reconstructed p T > 380 GeV. For tt events with invariant masses above 1.5 TeV, this addition increased the overall trigger efficiency in the muon channel to 96%. 2 Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples were used for signal processes, as well as background processes producing jets and prompt leptons. The MC samples are employed to develop the event selection, provide SM background estimates, and evaluate signal efficiencies. Background contributions from processes in which there are no genuine prompt isolated leptons were estimated directly from the data as described in section 7. The MC samples were processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation [38] based on Geant4 [39] or through a faster simulation making use of parameterised showers in the calorimeters [40]. Additional simulated proton-proton collisions generated using Pythia v8.1 [41] were overlaid to simulate the effects of additional collisions from the same and nearby bunch crossings (pile-up). All simulated events were then processed using the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis chain as the data. The simulated trigger and selection efficiencies were corrected to agree with the performance observed in data.",

Small-radius jets are required to satisfy p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, while large-radius jets are required to satisfy p T > 300 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. Low-p T central small-radius jets (p T < 50 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4) are required to have a jet vertex fraction [93] greater than 0.5. The jet vertex fraction is defined as the total transverse momentum (using a scalar sum) of tracks in the jet that are associated with the primary vertex divided by the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of all tracks in the jet. This variable suppresses jets arising from pile-up effects. Largeradius jets have jet trimming [17] applied. In trimming, subjets are formed by applying a jet algorithm with smaller radius parameter, R sub , and then soft subjets with less than a certain fraction, f cut , of the original jet p T are removed. The properties of the trimmed jet are then calculated using the surviving subjets. This procedure mitigates the effect of pile-up [94]. The trimming parameters used in this search are f cut = 0.05 and R sub = 0.3, and the inclusive k t [95] algorithm is used to form the subjets.",

            "text": "One of the dominant uncertainties affecting reconstructed objects is the jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty, especially for large-radius jets [91,92]. Uncertainties on the jet mass scale (JMS) and the k t splitting scales [92] are also important for this analysis. These uncertainties have an impact of 10% on the overall background yield in the boosted selection. The impact on the background estimates falls with increasing m reco tt , varying from 22% at lowest masses to about 7% above 1.5 TeV. The impact is smaller for the resolved selection, since the large-radius jets are only used indirectly there via the vetoing of events that satisfy the boosted selection. For large-radius jets, uncertainties on the jet energy resolution (JER) and jet mass resolution (JMR) are also considered. These are less significant than the JES. For small-radius jets, the uncertainties on the JES, the jet reconstruction efficiency and the jet energy resolution are considered [88,90]. The small-radius JES uncertainty is one of the most significant systematic uncertainties in the resolved selection, affecting the overall expected yield by 6%. The effect of uncertainties associated with the jet vertex fraction is also considered. The b-tagging uncertainty is modelled through simultaneous variations of the uncertainties on the efficiency and rejection [112,113]. An additional b-tagging uncertainty 6 is applied for high-momentum jets (p T > 300 GeV) to account for uncertainties on the modelling of the track reconstruction in high-p T environments, which is one of the dominant uncertainties for high-mass signals.",

The QED ISR/FSR uncertainty is negligible at this level. The dependency of the m reco tt shape on the choice of NLO generator is accounted for by using the difference between samples generated with MC@NLO and Powheg-Box+Herwig as a systematic uncertainty. The parton showering and fragmentation uncertainty on the tt background is estimated by comparing the results from a sample generated with Powheg-Box [48], interfaced with Pythia or Herwig. The uncertainty on the m reco tt distribution arising from the uncertainty in the top quark mass is evaluated by comparing the m reco tt spectrum using the nominal sample to those generated with top quark masses of 170 and 175 GeV, and multiplying the difference by 0.4 (to approximate a one standard deviation uncertainty, corresponding to \u00b11.0 GeV). The uncertainty on the electroweak corrections to top quark pair production is modelled by changing the difference of each correction factor from unity by \u00b110%.",

Observed and expected upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio to tt final states as a function of the mass of (a) Topcolour-assisted-technicolour Z TC2 , (b) Bulk RS Kaluza-Klein gluon, (c) Bulk RS Kaluza-Klein graviton, (d) scalar resonance. The expected limits are derived from nominal (pre-fit) background estimates. The theoretical predictions for the production cross-section times branching ratio at the corresponding masses are also shown. prediction as seen in figure 9 is slightly higher than the data, which would lead to the anticipation that the observed limits should be slightly better than the expected ones. However, the central values of some nuisance parameters are significantly shifted in the fit. In the high-m reco tt region one of the dominant uncertainties is the high-p T jet b-tagging extrapolation uncertainty, as detailed in section 8. This uncertainty is reduced to half of its original size by the fit, and the central value is also shifted downwards by approximately one pre-fit standard deviation. As this uncertainty is associated with reconstructed physics objects, it has correlated effects on the predictions of BSM signal and SM background. The 1\u03c3 change in the central value of this nuisance parameter reduces the acceptance of high-mass signals in the boosted selection considerably: approximately 25% for a Z with a mass of 2 TeV. As a consequence, the observed upper limits on the cross-section obtained from the fit to the data are larger than the expected ones fitted to the nominal background estimates. Constraints from the fit are also observed in the nuisance parameters  Figure 12. Observed and expected upper limits on the production cross-section for a Kaluza-Klein gluon times its branching ratio to tt, as a function of its width, for three representative mass values. The expected limits are derived from nominal (pre-fit) background estimates. The theoretical predictions for the production cross-section times branching ratio at the corresponding widths are also shown. associated with other major systematic uncertainties such as the PDF, the shape of W +jets background, the energy and mass scales for both the large-radius and small-radius jets, btagging efficiencies, and tt MC modelling. These constraints are understood through their impact on the fitted m reco tt distributions. A few of the other nuisance parameters also have their central values changed slightly by the fit, but their impact on the signal acceptance and hence cross-section limits are much smaller than the one detailed above.",

Indeed an equally good fit can be obtained by introducing an additional ad hoc uncertainty in the modelling of the SM tt background with a similar dependency on m reco tt . Such a mis-modelling would not reduce the signal acceptance and results in more stringent limits on the cross-section times tt branching ratio. Ultimately, no method was found to unambiguously ascertain the origin of this mis-modelling. The limits presented here are those with a 1\u03c3 change in the fitted value of the nuisance parameter associated with the high-p T jet b-tagging extrapolation uncertainty, which correspond to more conservative results.

The search uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No excess of events beyond the Standard Model predictions is observed in the tt invariant mass spectra. Upper limits on the cross-section times branching ratio are set for four different signal models: a narrow (\u2264 3% width) Z boson, a broad (15.3% width) Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gluon, a Bulk Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein graviton, and a narrow scalar resonance. Based on these results, the existence of a narrow leptophobic topcolour Z in the range 0.4 TeV < m Z < 1.8 TeV is excluded at 95% CL. A broad Kaluza-Klein gluon with mass between 0.4 TeV and 2.2 TeV is also excluded at 95% CL.
