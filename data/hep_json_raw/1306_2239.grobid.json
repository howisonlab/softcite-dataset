            "text": "The measurement of CP asymmetries in flavour-changing neutral-current processes provides a crucial test of the Standard Model (SM). In particular, loop-mediated (penguin) decays of B mesons are sensitive probes for physics beyond the SM. Transitions between the quarks of the third and second generation (b \u2192 s) or between the quarks of the third and first generation (b \u2192 d) are complementary since SM CP violation is tiny in b \u2192 s transitions and an observation of CP violation would indicate physics beyond the SM. For b \u2192 d transitions the SM branching fraction is an order of magnitude smaller than b \u2192 s due to the relative suppression of |V td | 2 /|V ts | 2 . It is particularly useful to have experimental information on pairs of channels related by d \u2194 s exchange symmetry to test that the QCD contribution to the decay is independent of the initial B 0 or B 0 s meson. The BaBar and Belle experiments have performed measurements of b \u2192 sqq processes, such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S , B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 K 0 S and B 0 \u2192 f 0 K 0 S [1][2][3], and of b \u2192 dqq penguin diagrams, such as B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S and B + \u2192 K + K 0 S [4,5]. These modes contain pseudo-scalar or scalar mesons in their final state whereas B 0 (s) \u2192 V V decays, where V and V are light vector mesons, provide a valuable additional source of information because the angular distributions give insight into the physics of hadronic B meson decays and the interplay -1 -",

This decay is closely linked to B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 , differing in the spectator quark and the final quark in the loop, as shown in figure 1. 1 From the aforementioned relation between b \u2192 s and b \u2192 d transitions, their relative branching fractions should scale as |V td | 2 /|V ts | 2 and their polarization fractions are expected to be very similar. Moreover, since both decays share the same final state, except for charge conjugation, B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 is the ideal normalization channel for the determination of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 branching fraction. The B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 decay is also related to B 0 \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 , since their loop diagrams only differ in the spectator quark (s instead of d), although it has been suggested that S-wave interference effects might break the SU(3) symmetry relating two channels [27]. Finally, it is also interesting to explore the relation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 decay with the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 mode since the penguin loop diagrams of these modes are related by the d \u2194 s exchange. The B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 decay also has a b \u2192 u tree diagram, but it is expected that the penguin contribution is dominant, since the branching fraction JHEP11(2013)092 Figure 1.

The fit model is validated with 10, 000 pseudo-experiments, generated with simplified simulations, which show that the signal yields are unbiased. Table 1 summarizes the signal and background contributions resulting from the fit. A likelihood ratio test is employed to assess the statistical significance of the B 0 In order to explore systematic effects in the signal yield originating in the fit model two effects were considered. First, the amount of B 0 \u2192 (K + K \u2212 )(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) events under the B 0 s \u2192 (K + K \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) signal is governed by the 24.74 MeV/c 2 factor in eq. (5.1). Similarly, the contamination of misidentified \u039b 0 b decays under the signal is controlled by a tail that is parametrized. An extended likelihood is built by multiplying the original likelihood function by Gaussian distributions of these two nuissance parameters with standard deviations of 20% of their nominal values at which they are centered. The corresponding systematic uncertainty in the signal yield is obtained by performing a fit that maximizes this modified likelihood. The systematic contribution is calculated subtracting the statistical uncertainty in quadrature and found to be \u00b11.2 events. Including this uncertainty results in a significance of 6.2\u03c3. Effects of other systematic uncertainties, discussed in section 9, have negiglible impact in the signal significance.",
