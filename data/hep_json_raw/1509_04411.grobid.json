We have extended and enhanced our earlier analysis to include recent developments in the understanding of the effects of gravity in depolarizing ultracold neutrons; an improved calculation of the spectrum of the neutrons; and conservative estimates of other possible systematic errors, which are also shown to be consistent with more recent measurements undertaken with the apparatus. We obtain a net result of d n \u00bc \u22120.21 AE 1.82 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm, which may be interpreted as a slightly revised upper limit on the magnitude of the EDM of 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm (90% C.L.) or 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm (95% C.L.).",

However, in the presence of a magnetic-field gradient, the mercury (and, to a far lesser extent, neutron) frequency acquires a component that is linear in the applied electric field [4], and thus mimics the signal for an EDM. We have no direct measurement of the applied B-field gradient, but since the neutrons have a lower center of mass than the (thermal) mercury atoms, any change in the gradient results in a change in the neutron-tomercury frequency ratio. A linear dependence of the measured apparent EDM as a function of this ratio therefore emerges, as shown in Fig. 2 of [1] and reproduced here in Fig. 1, with a positive (negative) slope for a downwards (upwards) direction of the applied magnetic fieldB. We discuss this further in Sec. IV below.",

As discussed in [3], the Hg frequency was determined by fitting a 15 s averaging period at either end of the cycle in order to determine the phase, and hence the integrated phase difference accumulated over the time between them. The corresponding phases for the neutrons, on the other hand, are determined by the 2 s spin-flip pulses at either end. The field jumps can occur at any point during the 220 s measurement cycle. If they occur outside the Ramsey sequence, they are of little concern. If they occur between the 15 s windows, they can be regarded as appropriately compensated. That leaves a potential 30 s period during which there is a risk of incomplete compensation, i.e. 1=7 of such jumps can be expected to affect the measurement to a greater or lesser extent. On average, these potentially risky field jumps would occur halfway through the 15 s window, i.e. about 1=20 of the way through the Ramsey measurement. The mercury frequency-jump distribution was truncated at AE60 \u03bcHz, corresponding to a change in neutron frequency of 230 \u03bcHz over this 1=20 of the Ramsey period. When averaged over the entire Ramsey period, the neutrons would therefore see a frequency shift of up to 11 \u03bcHz, or 0.4 ppm, that would not be compensated properly by the mercury. Including the aforementioned 1=7 probability, this corresponds (even at the extremes of the frequency-jump distribution) to a potential error in R 0 of 0.06 ppm on the rare cycles within which such jumps occur, to be compared with a typical statistical uncertainty on the neutron frequency of about 0.7 ppm.",

Under the assumption that leakage currents would run along preferred established paths-rather than averaging out over different paths-then if such leakage currents were to generate EDM signals, measurement cycles with high leakage currents would be expected to show a greaterthan-average departure from the Ramsey curve, and thus to have high Ramsey-residual stretch values [Eq.

The widths of these Gaussians are plotted against leakage current in Fig. 7. No consistent trend is visible.

At the start of its trajectory, just left of center at the bottom, it is subject to the radial field B r as well as to the sidewaysB v component, yielding a diagonal resultant. As it traverses the trap, the B r component shrinks and then reverses direction, causing a smooth rotation of the net additional effective B field. Eventually, the particle reaches the far end of the trap, is reflected from the wall and begins its trajectory back. However, theB v component then faces in the opposite direction: therefore, after a discrete jump at the point of reflection, the additional net effective field component continues to rotate in the same direction. The particle thus sees a rotating field in the x-y plane, which, through the Ramsey-Bloch-Siegert [13,14] mechanism, \"pulls\" its resonant frequency away from the central value. When averaged over both directions of a given trajectory, the net frequency shift is proportional to E, and it therefore mimics an EDM signal. The size of this false-EDM effect depends upon the relative magnitudes of the orbital-trajectory frequency of the particle and its Larmor precession frequency. The neutrons are in the adiabatic limit, where their rapidly precessing spins can follow the variations in field. In that case, the false EDM is given by [4] ",

This fitted value of the slope was particularly influenced by one run (number 1900) that was taken at a large applied \u2202B z =\u2202z (giving it significant leverage) and which departed from the fitted line by 2.7\u03c3: excluding that run would have changed the value of the fitted slope to 1.63 AE 0.27 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm=ppm and increased the crossing-point EDM value by 0.22 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm, but there appeared to be no a priori reason to do so. The run was therefore included both in the initial 2006 analysis [1] and in the analysis that follows here. According to Eq. (21), the slope k is expected to be inversely proportional to \u0394h. We shall discuss the estimation of \u0394h in Sec. IV C. The relationship between R and d n;Hg;f is also affected substantially by the phenomenon of gravitationally enhanced depolarization [18], and this will be discussed in Sec. IV D below. In addition, the slope k can be altered by a few percent (although still remaining highly symmetric under B 0 reversal) by various other mechanisms including the UCNs' own false-EDM signal (a 2% effect); a slight reduction in mean free path due to cavities and grooves in the electrodes as well as to the presence of 10 \u22123 torr of He gas to prevent sparks [4,19] (1%); and a possible bias in the volume-averaged frequency measurement due to asymmetric surface relaxation of the Hg, e.g. if there is a preferential depolarization on one electrode or the other (up to 5%).",

The (sometimes surprising) consequences of this effect have only recently been studied in detail [18,23], and have now been validated by comparison with data [24,25]. This stratification results in a dephasing of the ensemble in addition to that arising from the intrinsic depolarization that naturally occurs within each energy bin. Since lower-energy neutrons preferentially populate the bottom of the bottle, this dephasing is asymmetric, and results in a (strongly spectrum dependent) frequency shift. Calculations in [18] were based upon a Maxwellian velocity distribution with a sharp 93 cm height-equivalent energy cutoff. The simulated spectrum shown in Fig. 11 is much softer than this, showing a clear peak at 20-30 cm height-equivalent energy. Under these conditions the gravitational-depolarization effect distorts the shape of the crossing lines, significantly enhancing the slope for measurements beyond a few ppm from the origin, as shown explicitly in Fig. 13. The solid red line is the best linear fit to the data, mirroring the lines shown in Fig. 1, whereas the dashed green line is the expectation from Eq. (21).

Effects of intrinsic depolarization were explicitly included in this model, although perhaps not perfectly since (as discussed in [18]) it has a significant dependence upon the specularity of reflections within the trap. However, its contribution to the frequency-shift effect is negligible [24]; primarily, it simply smears the phases. Additionally, it is worth noting that in principle the effective UCN spectrum could be slightly influenced, leading to different slopes k \u2191 , k \u2193 for the two B 0 field directions, if the spin relaxation were substantially different for the two configurations. This extra relaxation, if it existed, would be expected to be UCN-velocity dependent, and so would change the effective UCN energy spectrum. However, the observed polarization product \u03b1 (i.e. the visibility of the Ramsey fringes) is identical at the 2% level for the two B-field polarities. This suggests [24] that the average UCN energy, and therefore \u0394h (which is approximately inversely proportional to the energy) should be the same to better than a few percent between the two polarities. It is difficult to conceive of a mechanism that would change the slope more significantly than this upon field reversal.",

This revealed the presence of such horizontal field components, quadrupolar in form and a few nT in magnitude throughout the 12 cm height of the measurement bottle. The magnitude of these quadrupole fields also depends slightly upon the orientation (upwards or downwards) of the B 0 holding field. This is to be expected, since the B 0 return flux passes through the innermost mu-metal shield: indeed, about 40% of the B 0 field arises not from the B 0 coil directly but from the magnetization of the shields. The geometry of the 1.15 m diameter mu-metal shield around the B 0 coil has irregularities on the scale of a few millimeters, so it seems reasonable to expect that aberrations in the B 0 field near the outer edges of the trap should be of the order of a few nT. Unlike the remanent fields arising from any permanent magnetization of the shields themselves, any B 0xy fields will reverse when B 0 is reversed. Contributions from these two different sources may therefore add in one field direction and subtract in the other, leading to a differential shift of all R a values, and thus of the two lines, thereby changing the EDM value d \u00d7 at the crossing point of Fig. 1.",

The results of a detailed fluxgate scan taken in 2010 within the rebuilt shields is shown in Fig. 14, and here a quadrupole-type field pattern can be seen clearly. A detailed harmonic analysis of the field shape yielded an average q value of \u22121.29 \u00f03.24\u00de nT=m for B 0 up (down), which would imply corresponding quadrupole shifts of \u03b4R Q \u00bc 0.02 \u00f00.14\u00de ppm for the two respective B 0 directions. We do not include these figures in our analysis at this point, but we will return to the issue briefly during our conclusions.",

As discussed above, this door sits at the bottom of a small cavity, 4.0 cm deep and 6.8 cm in diameter, at the center of the lower electrode. As detailed in Sec. VI, measurements were made of the neutron and mercury response in a storage trap with a ceiling of variable height, and the results provided clear evidence for the existence of both dipole and quadrupole fields. This conclusion was reinforced by measurements undertaken some years later when, as part of the process of characterizing the system during its removal to PSI, scans were made of the components. A crank-andsliding-plate assembly that converted rotation of the driving shaft into the linear motion of the neutron door was revealed to be slightly magnetic, with summary records showing that a sensor several centimeters away registered a field of 2.5 nT. A disk that constituted the lower part of the door itself also yielded a total field of about 100 pT at a distance of \u223c13 cm from the sensor. Various other parts, designated \"screws,\" \"piston,\" \"Al frame\" and so on, were tabulated as having associated fields of a few pT to a few tens of pT. Detailed records of orientations and positions were not kept, since the primary goal at that time was merely to determine whether or not the components were magnetic. It is therefore not possible at this point to specify the dipole position and strength precisely from the information now available, so as in the 2006 analysis we rely upon the contemporary measurements and regard the later scans merely as qualitative supporting evidence, but it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that there were fields of \u223c nT strength and approximately dipolar in nature in the vicinity of the UCN door. The picture is also consistent with measurements undertaken (after the EDM measurements, but prior to moving the apparatus to PSI) with a fluxgate magnetometer located in the vertical neutron guide immediately underneath the neutron door. This registered a slight change (circa 1 nT) in the ambient magnetic field when the door mechanism was operated.",

However, we note that the associated frequency shifts arise via h\u2202B z =\u2202zi, which would be much lower in the case of a horizontal orientation (not least due to cancellation of the respective field components from opposite ends of the dipole). Furthermore, the analysis of [17] (and in particular Fig. 2 therein) shows both that a horizontal alignment (for a dipole within a few centimeters of the axis) yields a much smaller EDM contribution than does a vertical alignment, and also that the EDM contribution (of the vertically aligned dipole, again within a few centimeters of the axis) has very little sensitivity to the radial position. We therefore conclude that our model accounts in a reasonable manner for the most important contributions.",

If present throughout our measurements, this could have contributed a false EDM of up to AE4.0 \u00d7 10 \u221228 ecm (according to the Pignol-Roccia analysis). In order to be conservative, though, we retain the full AE6.0 \u00d7 10 \u221227 e cm contribution to the systematic uncertainty, in order to accommodate both the possible undetected presence of a (further) PMD and the fact that we have not modeled the actual door dipole perfectly.",

Such shifts are produced by any small component, parallel to B 0 , of the 204 Hg probe light beam passing through the precessing 199 Hg atoms. This component, and the consequent R a shift, reverse sign on reversal of B 0 . False EDM signals can thenarise in two distinct ways: (i) Direct: If any changes in intensity are correlated with the electric field direction, the resultant frequency shift would mimic an EDM. (ii) Indirect: Even if the intensity of the light is completely constant, the light shifts move the data points of the two lines in Fig. 1 in opposite (horizontal) directions, and thus contribute a vertical offset to the crossing point. A slight dependence of R a on the incident light intensity was indeed found during the 2006 analysis, the magnitude \u223c0.2 ppm being in agreement with theory. (Similarly small shifts were found in a recent measurement of the ratio of the neutron to 199 Hg gyromagnetic ratios, using the upgraded nEDM apparatus at PSI with similar Hg discharge bulbs but with a new storage chamber [9].) A correction to d meas was made on a run-by-run basis, leading to an overall correction of \u00f03.5 AE 0.8\u00de \u00d7 10 \u221227 e cm. For this analysis we have simply applied exactly the same set of (almost imperceptible) shifts to the data, prior to the crossing-lines fitting procedure. Since the dependence should thereby have been removed, we expect no remaining net bias from this source. Details of the light-shift analysis are discussed extensively in [3], and will not be addressed further here.",

These differences would have reduced the quadrupole shifts by a factor Q \u223c 0.59. (Note that, although the quadrupole shifts are reduced in this way, the shifts due to Earth's rotation are not.) The roof and floor were coated with deuterated polystyrene (DPS) rather than the diamondlike carbon used for the main data-taking trap, but the DPS tended to flake away, leaving some bare aluminum exposed: the resulting UCN spectrum would therefore have had a slightly lower end-point cutoff than in the data-taking trap, although after some tens of seconds of storage this would have made little difference. Measurements were taken at storage times of several tens of seconds' duration rather than the full 135 s, because with the reduced-height bottle the loss rates were much higher. Spectrum calculations were carried out exactly as described above for the data-taking bottle, assuming the same initial spectrum and per-collision loss rates.

The procedure was repeated for B 0 up, although in this case measurements were only made for trap heights of 59 and 109 mm. We denote the values of R 0 in this \"gradient-compensated\" environment as R 0 gc \u00f0H\u00de. Naturally, it was not possible in reality to trim the gradients perfectly, but studying the Hg response enabled appropriate corrections to be made. For this analysis we have restricted ourselves to the 11 measurement runs for which such gradient corrections to R 0 amount to less than 0.5 ppm.",

The contributions to the mercury and UCN frequencies, and hence the expected ratio R a , could then be calculated as a function of the height H of the trap roof. Each iteration of the fit used its selected values for the strength and position of the dipole, for R \u03b3 , and for the quadrupole shifts.

The effects of such collisions, in which the neutron energy changes by only a small amount so that it remains in the UCN range, have been looked for by Richardson [30]. For a greased surface, an upper limit of 50 feV for the energy change per wall collision was established, from which it can be calculated that the maximum movement will be no more than 1 mm during the 130 s Ramsey measurement period. If the volume-averaged angles between E, B and v are each as high as 2\u00b0\u00bc 0.035 radians, the induced false EDM will be 1 \u00d7 10 \u221230 e cm. (Note that such warming is distinct from the changing \u0394h arising from the preferential loss of faster UCNs: the latter do not ultimately contribute  to the EDM measurement, and so cannot generate a systematic error.) If there is a difference in a transverse coordinate x between where the neutrons enter the trap and their average center of mass during the storage time, the net average velocity is \u03b7 \u00bc x=T s . The effect of any such motion will be greatly reduced by the fact that it is only motion during the storage time between the two oscillating fields that affects the precession frequency. Since the trap is filled for 20 s, which in our apparatus is roughly 1.3 filling-time constants, and this is followed by a 5 s settling period, the stored neutrons have spent an average of one filling-time constant in the trap before the first oscillating field is applied. Collisions with the wall are expected to destroy any nonrandom motion within 100 bounces, i.e., about 10 s, so that any such motion that results from the filling process will mostly have died away before the first oscillating field is applied. The position of the center of mass during storage is expected to be very close to the axis of the 67 mm diameter guide tube. In the unlikely event that the neutrons fill preferentially at x \u00bc 1 cm towards one side of the guide tube, and ignoring any damping of the motion in the trap during filling, we would be left with a net motion during the 130 s Ramsey measurement of up to \u223c5 mm. This effect would then contribute 2\u03f5 \u00d7 10 \u221228 e cm \u00bc 6 \u00d7 10 \u221230 e cm. This dominates the earlier result associated with warming, and therefore becomes our total uncertainty for first-order translational v \u00d7 E; to be conservative we round the value up to 1 \u00d7 10 \u221229 e cm.",

Furthermore, we have also looked carefully at the implications of the fields as defined by the maps produced by the 2010 scans at PSI. We do not consider it appropriate to apply the results directly to our data, not only because the field scans were carried out after a lapse of several years and following dismantling, shipping and reassembly of the shields, but also because the accuracy of measurements of small transverse field components, typically a fraction of a percent of the main vertical field strength, is limited by the mechanical precision of the mapper system itself. Nonetheless, we considered it useful to carry out the analysis with the quadrupole shifts \u03b4R Q fixed at the values defined by these more recent field measurements. The  resulting value of d n was 0.76 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm (again with the same uncertainty), although as might be expected \u03c7 2 =\u03bd for the global fit deteriorated somewhat to 1.48. The range of variation of all of these results is of the order of the uncertainty on our systematic errors, and all lie comfortably within our confidence-limit range. Ultimately, and in conclusion, after a thorough reevaluation of the previously known systematic effects and the inclusion of various other newly established effects, the overall corrections to the 2006 result have been found-both individually and collectively-to be relatively small compared with the statistical uncertainty. As a direct consequence, our new limit represents a departure of only a few percent from the earlier limit of jd n j < 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm (90% C.L.) [1] despite the very real differences between the two analyses.",

It has been very substantially upgraded, including in particular with the provision of an array of high-precision cesium magnetometers [37], for a further nEDM measurement [38] at the new UCN source at PSI [39]. Furthermore, an innovative new spin-echo based technique [25] allows both the measurement of the UCN spectrum within the apparatus and an accurate determination of magnetic-field gradients. It is currently running with a greater sensitivity than ever before, and, with potential systematic errors now being very tightly constrained, new results will be limited only by statistics for some time to come.",
