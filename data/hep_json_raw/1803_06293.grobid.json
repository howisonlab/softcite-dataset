Our data sample consists of an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilation data produced by the BEPCII collider and collected and analyzed with the BESIII detector. We exclusively reconstruct three D 0 and six D + hadronic decay modes and use the ratio of the yield of fully reconstructed DD events (\"double tags\") to the yield of all reconstructed D orD mesons (\"single tags\") to determine the number of D 0D0 and D + D \u2212 events, benefiting from the cancellation of many systematic uncertainties. Combining these yields with an independent determination of the integrated luminosity of the data sample, we find the cross sections to be \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192D 0D0 )=(3.615\u00b10.010\u00b10.038) nb and \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192D + D \u2212 )=(2.830\u00b10.011\u00b10.026) nb, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.",

            "text": "The \u03c8(3770) resonance is the lowest-energy charmonium state above the threshold for decay to charmed meson pairs. The expectation that the \u03c8(3770) should decay predominantly to D 0D0 and D + D \u2212 has been validated by experiment [1], although inconsistent results for the branching fraction of \u03c8(3770) to non-DD final states have been reported [2,3]. The cross sections \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192D 0D0 ) and \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192D + D \u2212 ) at center-of-mass energy E cm =3.773 GeV, the peak of the \u03c8(3770) resonance, can be measured precisely and are necessary input for normalizing some measurements of charmed meson properties in \u03c8(3770) decays. The most precise determinations to date are from the CLEO-c Collaboration [4] using 818 pb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilation data at E cm = 3774\u00b11 MeV, \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192D 0D0 )=(3.607\u00b10.017\u00b10.056) nb and \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + D \u2212 ) = (2.882\u00b10.018\u00b10.042) nb. In this paper we report measurements of the DD cross sections using fully reconstructed D 0 and D + mesons in a \u03c8(3770) data sample that is approximately 3.6 times larger than CLEO-c's. Here and throughout this paper, charge-conjugate modes are implied unless explicitly stated.",

We use ratios of fully reconstructed D mesons (\"single tags\") and DD events (\"double tags\") to determine the total numbers of DD pairs. This procedure benefits from the cancellation of systematic uncertainties associated with efficiencies and input branching fractions, giving better overall precision than measurements based on single tags. The production of D 0D0 pairs in a pure C =\u22121 state complicates the interpretation of measurements at \u03c8(3770) by introducing correlations between the D 0 andD 0 decays. We apply corrections derived by Asner and Sun [6] to remove the bias introduced by these correlations.",

Charged particles are reconstructed in a 43-layer helium-gas-based drift chamber (MDC), which has an average single-wire resolution of 135 \u00b5m. A uniform axial magnetic field of 1 T is provided by a superconducting solenoid, allowing the precise measurement of charged particle trajectories. The resolution varies as a function of momentum, and is 0.5% at 1.0 GeV/c. The MDC is also instrumented to measure the specific ionization (dE/dx) of charged particles for particle identification. Additional particle identification is provided by a time-of-flight system (TOF) constructed as a cylindrical (\"barrel\") structure with two 5-cm-thick plastic-scintillator layers and two \"end caps\" with one 5-cm layer. The time resolu-tion in the barrel is approximately 80 ps, and in the end caps it is 110 ps. Just beyond the TOF is an electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consisting of 6240 CsI(Tl) crystals, also configured as a barrel and two end caps. For 1.0-GeV photons, the energy resolution is 2.5% in the barrel and it is 5% in the end caps. This entire inner detector resides in the solenoidal magnet, which is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke instrumented with resistive-plate counters interleaved with steel for muon identification (MUC). More detailed information on the design and performance of the BESIII detector can be found in Ref. [9].",

The first of these requirements is \u2206E =E D \u2212E beam 0, where E D is the energy of the reconstructed D candidate and E beam is the beam energy. In calculating \u2206E we use the beam energy calibrated with D 0 and D + decays, combining groups of nearby runs to obtain sufficient statistics. Selection requirements on \u2206E are determined separately for each tag mode for data and MC to account for differing resolutions. As shown in Table 1, for modes decaying into all charged tracks, the requirements are set to \u00b13\u03c3 about the mean, while for modes with a \u03c0 0 , the requirements are asymmetric about the mean, extending on the low side to \u22124\u03c3 to accommodate the tail from the photon energy resolution. Figure 1 shows the data and MC overlays of the \u2206E distributions by mode. Table 1. The selected range on \u2206E is \u00b13\u03c3 about the mean, except that for modes with a \u03c0 0 an extended lower bound of \u22124\u03c3 is used. The resolutions and means are extracted by fitting with a double Gaussian, weighted by the two Gaussian yields, and determined separately for data and MC.",

To assess the uncertainty in the double-tag fitting procedure, we obtain double-tag yields and efficiencies with an alternative sideband-subtraction method, dividing the twodimensional M BC plane into sections representing the signal and various background components, as shown in Fig. 3. The signal area is the same as that used when fitting. Horizontal and vertical bands are used to represent combinations with one correctly and one incorrectly reconstructed D; a diagonal band represents the background from completely reconstructed continuum events or mispartitioned DD events; and two triangles are used to represent the remaining background, which is mostly flat. An estimate of the flat background is scaled by the ratios of the sizes of each of the other background regions and subtracted to obtain estimates of the non-flat backgrounds. These backgrounds are then scaled with area and ARGUS background parameters obtained from single-tag fits to determine the overall background subtraction and yield for the signal region for a specific tag mode. The difference in efficiency-corrected double-tag yields for each mode between this method and the standard procedure is taken as the systematic uncertainty associated with the double-tag fitting method.",

The net momentum of the two tracks is therefore close to zero, and typical QED events also have small net momentum. This small momentum produces M BC values close to the beam energy, so that residual cosmic ray and QED events passing the veto distort the M BC distribution. Because the processes responsible are not included in our MC samples or well described by the ARGUS background function, the fit results may be affected. To assess this effect, we performed alternative single-tag fits for D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + with a cut-off in M BC at 1.88 GeV/c 2 , excluding the range where cosmic and QED events can contribute.

The cross section for \u03c8(3770) production in radiative events depends on the cross section value at the lower effective E cm that results from ISR. While this may partially cancel in the ratio, we treat it separately for single and double tags because yields and efficiencies are affected with opposite signs, and because correlations are introduced for the doubletag fits that are not present in the single-tag fits. The MC-determined efficiencies are affected through the \u2206E requirements, which select against large ISR because the \u2206E calculation assumes that the energy available to the D is the full beam energy. The data yields are affected via the M BC fit shape, which acquires an asymmetric high-side tail through the contribution of \u03c8(3770) production via ISR. More ISR causes a larger high-side tail in both the single-and double-tag signal shapes. Additionally, because both D mesons lose energy when ISR occurs, double-tag events that include ISR will have a correlated shift in M BC , causing such events to align with the diagonal to the high-side of the signal region in the two-dimensional M BC plane. We use a preliminary BE-SIII measurement of the \u03c8(3770) line shape to re-weight the MC and repeat the D-counting procedure.
