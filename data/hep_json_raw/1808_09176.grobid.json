This allowed to select a clean sample of about 450 events with K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 decays with the energy of the photon in the kaon rest frame greater than 30 MeV. The measured branching fraction of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 , with E * \u03b3 > 30 MeV is equal to (0.71 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . The measured differential branching fraction over photon energy is compared with the prediction of the chiral perturbation theory to O( p 4 ). A search for an updown asymmetry of the photon with respect to the hadronic system decay plane is also performed.",

            "text": "The present experimental status of K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 is rather meagre. It was observed in one experiment on statistics of 7 events [1]. The photon energies in these events were low, that did not allow to search for deviations from a simple QED process of photon emission. The measured value of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 branching ratio [2] is (1.04 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10 \u22124 for E * \u03b3 > 5 MeV. In the present analysis we have a possibility for more detailed study of this decay using larger data sample collected by the OKA experiment. This decay has certain interest for the theory, in partica e-mail: Mikhail.Shapkin@ihep.ru b e-mail: Alexander.Sadovskiy@ihep.ru ular, for the chiral perturbation theory [3][4][5][6] (CHPT), which gives appropriate framework for analysis of such decays. To the lowest order in an expansion in momenta and meson masses, this radiative decay is completely determined [7] by the non-radiative amplitude for K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . However, at next-to-leading order, a full-fledged CHPT calculation of nonleptonic weak amplitudes of O( p 4 ) is required. Such a calculation is done in [8]. It is interesting to confront these results to the experimental data. In a decay in the beauty sector B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 the LHCb experiment has found significant up-down asymmetry of the photon with respect to the hadronic system decay plane [9]. This observable was proposed in [10], it is both P and T-odd. We perform an analogous study for the radiative kaon decay K \u2192 3\u03c0\u03b3 to search for new physics effects.",

To reinforce GS, a gamma detector (BGD), made of lead glass blocks located behind the DV is used as a veto at large angles, while low angle particles pass through a central opening. The wide aperture spectrometric magnet, SM (S P40 A) , with a field integral of \u223c 1 Tm serves as a spectrometer for the charged decay products together with corresponding tracking chambers: 2 mm PC's (PC 1,...,8 ), 9 mm diameter straw tubes ST (1,2,3) and 30 mm diameter drift tubes DT 1,2 . The matrix hodoscope HODO (matri x) is composed of 252 scintillator tiles with WLS+SiPM readout. It is used in the trigger, improves time resolution and links x-y projections of a track. Two scintillation counters S bk1 , S bk2 serve to suppress undecayed beam particles. At the end of the OKA setup there are two calorimeters: electromagnetic (GAMS-2000) made of lead glass blocks and a hadron one (HCAL (G D A) ) -100 iron-scintillator sandwiches. Finally, four partially overlapping muon counters are located downstream the HCAL. The data acquisition system of the OKA setup [12] operates at \u223c 25 kHz event rate with the mean event size of \u223c 4 kByte. The detailes of the setup and the beam can be found elsewhere [13].",

The main source of the background for the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 decay is the decay of kaon to three charged pions when the pions produce hadron showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter and, because of fluctuations, a part of a shower is not associated with a charged track by the reconstruction program. To suppress such kind of background a cut on M(\u03c0 \u03b3 ) is done. The reconstructed momentum of the 3\u03c0\u03b3 system should be equal to the momentum of the beam particle. This motivates the last two cuts listed above. For the illustration, the distributions of the square of the transverse momentum of the 3\u03c0\u03b3 system and the ratio of absolute value of its momentum to the momentum of the beam particle after all the previous cuts is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The invariant mass distribution of the 3\u03c0\u03b3 system after application of all the cuts listed above is shown in Fig. 4. We see clear separation of the signal, peaking around the nominal value of the kaon PDG [2] mass and the background concentrating at higher masses. The number of events in the signal region is about 450. As almost all the photons in the selected K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 events have the energy in the kaon rest frame greater than 0.03 GeV, in the following analysis we apply an additional explicit cut E * \u03b3 > 0.03 GeV.",

Vertical arrows show the selected signal region are shown together with the data. We define the mass range of 0.486-0.504 GeV as a signal region. The number of the decays of K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 is determined as the difference of the number of the data events in the signal region and the expected number of events from the background. The expected background contribution to the signal region is determined using Monte Carlo events for six main channels of the kaon decays described in the above section. To determine the branching fraction of the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 we use the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + as the normalization channel. It is triggered with the same multiplicity trigger (Tr HODO ) as the signal and selected with the same criteria as for the pions of the 3\u03c0\u03b3 decay, thus we expect the cancellation of many systematic effects related to pions in the ratio of the branching fractions Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 )/Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ). The invariant mass spectrum of the system of three charged pions for the same selection criteria as for the charged part of the 3\u03c0\u03b3 decay is shown in Fig. 6. The branching fraction of the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 is determined in the following way: where Br(3\u03c0) P DG is the branching fraction of the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + from PDG [2]; (3\u03c0) and (3\u03c0\u03b3 ) are the reconstruction efficiencies for the decays The main source of the systematic error is the uncertainty in the estimate of the background contribution to the signal region (see Figs. 4 and 5). For the estimation of this uncertainty we varied the normalization of the background distribution. This leads to the systematic uncertainty of about 0.027 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the branching fraction. Another source of systematic error is cut's related. To estimate that, the cuts were varied within experimental resolution around nominal value and the branching was recalculated. The maximal change in the branching was considered as the systematic error. Adding all the systematic errors in quadrature gives a total systematic error of 0.03 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .
