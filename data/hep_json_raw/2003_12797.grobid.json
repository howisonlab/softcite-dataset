The results are presented for photons with 25 < E \u03b3 T < 200 GeV in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.44, and for different centrality intervals for PbPb collisions. Photon production in PbPb collisions is consistent with that in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, demonstrating that photons do not interact with the quark-gluon plasma. Therefore, isolated photons can provide information about the initial energy of the associated parton in photon+jet measurements. The results are compared with predictions from the next-to-leading-order jetphox generator for different parton distribution functions (PDFs) and nuclear PDFs (nPDFs). The comparisons can help to constrain the nPDFs global fits.",

            "text": "One of the most important reasons for studying relativistic heavy ion collisions is understanding the deconfined state of matter, so called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is predicted by the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to exist at high temperatures and energy density [1][2][3][4]. In heavy ion collisions, the expectation is that high transverse momentum (p T ) photons do not strongly interact with the QGP and thus provide a direct way to test perturbative QCD (pQCD). Comparing photon production in proton-proton (pp) and heavy ion collisions is important to both establish that we understand the production of photons in collisions of nuclei and that the photons are not affected by the medium through which they pass. In contrast to photons, partons lose energy in the medium and their production is significantly modified compared to pp collisions [5][6][7]. The production of photons paired back-to-back with jets from fragmented partons has been studied at the CERN LHC [8][9][10][11] to test energy loss in the strongly interacting medium produced in heavy ion collisions. Prompt photons are defined to be those produced directly from the hard scattering of two partons, or fragmented collinearly from final-state partons at high-p T [12]. At leading order (LO), partons produce photons through two hard scattering subprocesses: Compton scattering qg \u2192 q\u03b3 and quark-antiquark annihilation qq \u2192 g\u03b3 , of which Compton scattering is dominant [12]. To identify photons from parton scattering requires that the photons JHEP07(2020)116 be isolated from other particles in order to reduce a large background of decay photons coming from neutral mesons (mostly \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 ). This isolation requirement also suppresses the contribution from fragmentation processes [12]. As a result, isolated photon production is sensitive to the gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs).",

This T AA can be interpreted as the NN-equivalent integrated luminosity per heavy ion collision. Here, dN AA /dp T is the yield in AA collisions in a p T interval and d\u03c3 pp /dp T is the differential cross section in inelastic pp collisions. A value of R AA = 1 indicates that PbPb collision data are compatible with a superposition of pp collisions, while a deviation from unity indicates either enhancement or suppression of isolated photon production. The R AA of isolated photons allows an estimation of possible modification of the PDFs in a nucleus compared to a simple incoherent superposition of nucleon PDFs [14,15]. A typical form of such modifications is to have suppression at low Bjorken x 10 \u22122 (shadowing), and enhancement at x \u223c 10 \u22121 (anti-shadowing) [16].",

Each HF calorimeter consists of 432 readout towers, containing long and short quartz fibers running parallel to the beam. The long fibers run the entire depth of the HF calorimeter (165 cm, or approximately 10 interaction lengths), while the short fibers start at a depth of 22 cm from the front of the detector. By reading out the two sets of fibers separately, it is possible to distinguish showers generated by electrons and photons, which deposit a large fraction of their energy in the long-fiber calorimeter segment, from those generated by hadrons, which produce on average nearly equal signals in both calorimeter segments. In PbPb collisions, the HF calorimeters are used to determine the centrality of the collision, which is defined by the geometrical overlap of the two colliding Pb nuclei [29]. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.",

The remaining background contributions from decay photons are suppressed by imposing the isolation requirement, resulting in a sample enriched in prompt photons. The generator-level isolation (I gen ) is defined as the E gen T sum of all the other final-state particles, excluding neutrinos, in a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.4 around the photon candidates.

The UE is corrected when measuring I in PbPb data by subtracting the average value of the energy in a rectangular area with length of 2\u2206R in the \u03b7-direction around a photon candidate and width of 2\u03c0 in the \u03c6-direction, while no UE correction is applied JHEP07 (2020)116in pp data.

The sideband region is chosen to be close to the signal region in order to reduce bias from the correlation between \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 and I. The signal contamination in the sideband region is estimated by taking the signal shape from simulation and normalizing with the fraction between the signal and the sideband regions. The normalized signal shape is then subtracted from the background template. The purity, which is the fraction of prompt photons within the remaining candidates, is determined from the template fit. An example is shown in figure 1 for the photons with 40 < E \u03b3 T < 50 GeV in the 10-30% centrality class. The purity decreases in more central collisions, reflecting an increase in background contributions. The raw signal yield (N \u03b3 raw ) is defined as the number of photon candidates passing all selection criteria.

The CT14(PbPb)/CT14(pp) ratio shows the isospin effect which is caused by the different ratios of u and d quarks in pp and PbPb collisions. The jetphox scale uncertainties for R AA are canceled in the ratio. The Hessian PDF uncertainties for R AA are calculated for 68% CL. The R AA measurements are consistent with the jetphox prediction within the quoted statistical and systematic uncertainties. The comparison of data and estimations is limited by the uncertainties, barring any firm conclusions for the moment.",

No significant modification of isolated photon cross sections in PbPb collisions with respect to scaled pp collisions is observed in the explored kinematic ranges at all collision centralities. Thus, isolated photons are not affected by the strongly interacting medium produced in heavy ion collisions, and they can be a valuable tool to access the initial p T of the associated parton in photon+jet events.

The vertical bars associated with symbols indicate the statistical uncertainties and the horizontal bars reflect the bin width. The total systematic uncertainties without the T AA uncertainty are shown as the colored boxes.
