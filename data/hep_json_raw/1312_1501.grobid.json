Compared to the 2005 ALEPH publication, the main improvement is related to the use of a new method to unfold the measured mass spectra from detector effects. This procedure also corrects a previous problem in the correlations between the unfolded mass bins. Results from QCD studies and for the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the anomalous muon magnetic moment are derived using the new spectral functions. They are found in agreement with published results based on the previous set of spectral functions.",

            "text": "Because of its relatively large mass and the simplicity of its decay mechanism, the \u03c4 lepton offers many interesting and sometimes unique possibilities for testing the Standard Model. Among these, the production of hadrons from the QCD vacuum has been widely studied. The \u03c4 data were proved to be complementary to data from e + e \u2212 annihilation, allowing one to perform detailed studies at the fundamental level through the determination of the spectral functions, which embody both the rich hadronic structure seen at low energy, and the quark behaviour relevant at higher energy. The spectral functions play an important role in the understanding of hadron dynamics at intermediate energies and they form a basic ingredient in QCD studies and in evaluating hadronic vacuum polarisation effects. Robust predictions of these effects are needed for precision tests of electroweak theory through the running of \u03b1 to the M Z scale, and to compute the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. For the a e-mail: zhangzq@lal.in2p3.fr latter application the spectral function of the \u03c0\u03c0 0 state is of paramount importance as it dominates the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution.",

A i j and P i j depend on the assumed true spectrum while P i j , which describes detector and final state radiation effects, to good approximation does not.

Differences between data and folded ('reconstructed') MC spectra are ascribed to differences in the unfolded ('true') spectra. At each step of the iterative re-weighting process, the data-MC differences of the reconstructed spectra are unfolded and added to the true MC spectrum. Such iterative procedures can result in a significant bias in the final results if statistical fluctuations are mis-interpreted as genuine differences between data and MC distributions. The method is therefore stabilised with the use of a regularisation function that suppresses large fluctuations in the unfolded data. The new unfolding method is using a weaker regularisation (based on the significance of the data-MC differences in each bin of the spectrum) than the SVD approach which imposes constraints on the average curvature of the spectrum [8]. Therefore, the new method induces less smoothing and correlations between mass bins. Details on the method are given in [5].",

To achieve this the true MC spectrum is reweighted using a smooth function to improve the agreement between data and the reconstructed MC. The so reweighted MC spectrum is then reconstructed and provided as input to the unfolding process that uses the same transfer matrix as for data. The comparison between the reweighted true MC spectrum and the unfolded one provides a measure of the bias introduced by the method. The results are shown in Fig. 2 for the \u03c0\u03c0 0 channel. After 5 iterations the relative difference is very small and negligible compared to the other sources of systematic uncertainties. Inserting additional statistical fluctuations in the closure test to decorrelate the MC events used in the unfolding from those entering the response matrix does not noticeably alter the result.",

The histograms show the relative difference (bias) between the true MC spectrum and the result after unfolding of the reconstructed distribution in two cases: after the first iteration (dashed) and after five iterations (solid bold). For comparison the relative statistical uncertainty on the pseudodata spectrum is indicated by the band between the two light histograms. The fluctuations in the unfolded spectrum after five iterations are of mainly statistical origin. Rebinning to broader bins reveals a negligible systematic bias level in the \u03c0\u03c0 0 mode near threshold and in the 0.8-1.0 GeV 2 region. One also observes some structures in the 3\u03c0\u03c0 0 mode which was not present in the previous analysis. In fact such a structure was already there in the raw mass spectrum, but was smoothed away by our implementation of the SVD unfolding. An increased statistical uncertainty is also observed near the edges of phase space due to the reduced regularisation in the unfolding method employed here.",

The updated spectral functions have been used to repeat the analyses of [3]: a phenomenological fit to the \u03c0\u03c0 0 mass spectrum, a QCD analysis using the vector, axial-vector, and total non-strange spectral functions, and the computation of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.
