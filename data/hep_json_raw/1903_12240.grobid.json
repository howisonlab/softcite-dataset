Theoretically, the spectra and properties of these states are well described by potential models [3]. In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in charmonium spectroscopy initially triggered by the discovery of the \u03c7 c1 (3872) meson 1 by the Belle experiment [4] and the subsequent observation of other states that do not fit into the conventional hidden-charm spectrum. To be confident that the new states are exotic in nature, all predicted cc states need to be accounted for.",

            "text": "Amongst the expected charmonia close to DD threshold, the states \u03b7 c2 (1 1 D 2 ) and \u03c8 3 (1 3 D 3 ) remain undiscovered [5,6]. Though the latter state lies above the open charm threshold, the decay to the DD final state is suppressed due to the F-wave centrifugal barrier factor. Consequently, the \u03c8 3 (1 3 D 3 ) state is expected to be narrow with a natural width of 1-2 MeV [7,8]. Predictions for the mass of this state lie in the range 3815-3863 MeV/c 2 [6,[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Since it has negative C parity, it cannot be produced in either \u03b3\u03b3 annihilation or gg fusion. In ref. [8] it is suggested that a possible production mechanism for this state is via electric-dipole radiative transitions from the \u03c7 c2 (2 3 P 2 ) tensor state. In this paper, the observation of a new cc meson decaying to both the D + D \u2212 and D 0 D 0 final states is reported. The data sample used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated JHEP07(2019)035 luminosity of 9 fb \u22121 recorded with the LHCb detector in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, during the years 2011-2018. The mass and width of the new state are quite similar to those expected for the missing \u03c8 3 (1 3 D 3 ) state with J PC = 3 \u2212\u2212 . In addition, the production of both \u03c8(3770) and \u03c7 c2 (3930) mesons is observed. The first state is well known through measurements at e + e \u2212 colliders, but so far it has only been observed in a hadronic environment in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mass spectrum of B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays 2 [16]. The latter state has only been previously observed in the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 DD process by the Belle and BaBar experiments [17,18]. Both analyses prefer a spin assignment of 2 for this state based upon one-dimensional angular distributions.",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [19,20] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [21], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [22,23] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The momentum scale is calibrated using samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays collected concurrently with the data sample used for this analysis [24,25]. The relative accuracy of this procedure is estimated to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 using samples of other fully reconstructed b hadrons, \u03a5 and K 0 S mesons. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [26]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [27].",

The selection starts from good-quality charged tracks with p T > 250 MeV/c that are inconsistent with being produced in a pp interaction vertex. Selected tracks are required to be identified as either kaons or pions using information from the RICH detectors, and are then used to build D 0 and D + candidates reconstructed in the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay modes. The tracks forming D 0 and D + candidates are required to originate from a common vertex. To reduce combinatorial background, the decay time of D 0 and D + candidates is required to exceed 100 \u00b5m/c and the momentum direction to be consistent with the vector from the primary to the secondary vertex. The latter requirement also reduces the contribution from charm hadrons produced in the weak decays of long-lived beauty hadrons. Selected D 0 and D + candidates, generically referred to as D candidates hereafter, with p T > 1 GeV/c are combined to form D 0 D 0 and D + D \u2212 candidates. A fit is performed for each DD candidate [40], such that both D mesons are required to originate from a common vertex that is consistent with the PV location. A requirement on the fit \u03c7 2 reduces, to a negligible level, the background from D and D candidates produced in two independent pp interactions, and further suppresses the contribution from beauty hadrons.",

The \u03c8(3770) \u2192 DD component is modelled as a relativistic multi-channel P-wave Breit-Wigner function [44,45], accounting for decays into D 0 D 0 , D + D \u2212 and non-DD final states [41], convolved with a double-Gaussian resolution model. The background is modelled as a product of a scaled two-body phase-space function and a second-order polynomial function. The shape of the feed-down contribution from \u03c7 c1 (3872) decays is described using simulated two-body \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 D * 0 D 0 and three-body \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 D 0 D 0 \u03c0 0 decays. The latter corresponds to off-shell decays of the intermediate D * 0 mesons [46,47]. The simulation of \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 D * 0 D 0 decays assumes that the D * 0 mesons are unpolarised and the three-body decay dynamics are not included. The contributions from the two-body and three-body decays of the \u03c7 c1 (3872) state are allowed to vary independently in the fit. A simultaneous binned extended maximum-likelihood fit to the D 0 D 0 and D + D \u2212 mass spectra is performed. In this fit, the mass and width of the X(3842) signal are fixed from the results of the unbinned fit in the narrow 3.80 < m(DD) < 3.88 GeV/c 2 region, the mass of the \u03c8(3770) state is allowed to vary, while the natural width of the \u03c8(3770) state is Gaussian-constrained to the known value of \u0393 \u03c8(3770) = 27.2 \u00b1 1.0 MeV [41]. The mass of the \u03c8(3770) state and the scale factor for the background two-body phase space function are common parameters and all other parameters are allowed to vary independently. The result of the fit to the D 0 D 0 and D + D \u2212 mass spectra is shown in figure 5 and the resulting parameters of interest are summarised in table 3. The fit quality in the region m D 0 D 0 < 3.74 GeV/c 2 is poor, possibly due to large effects of the neglected dynamics in \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 D 0 D 0 X decays. However, it is found that the exact description of the \u03c7 c1 (3872) contribution does not affect the measurement of the mass of the \u03c8(3770) state.",

For the X(3842) and \u03c7 c2 (3930) states, alternative signal descriptions with multi-channel relativistic Breit-Wigner functions with D 0 D 0 and D + D \u2212 and radiative non-DD decays are used.

The determination of the natural width of the X(3842) and \u03c7 c2 (3930) states relies on accurate modelling of the detector resolution. Comparing data and simulation for decay modes with low energy release such as the \u03c7 c1 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, agreement at the 10% level is found [48]. Even better agreement is found for b-hadron decays to pairs of open charm hadrons such as 49], where the energy release is larger. Hence, to estimate the corresponding uncertainty the resolution scale is varied by 10% and the fit is repeated. Alternative resolution models, such as a symmetric double-sided Crystal Ball function [50,51] and a symmetric variant of the Apollonios function [52] are used to estimate the uncertainty associated with this choice.",
