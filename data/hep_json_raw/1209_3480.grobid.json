In their Fig. 3, there is evidence for fine structure in the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0\u03c0 mass range 1700-1900 MeV. On a larger scale, there is a conspicuous broad peak centred at 2300 MeV with a full width at half-maximum of \u223c 750 MeV, see their Fig. 2(b). As a shorthand, this peak will be called Y (2300). No fine structure is visible in this broad peak from 2000 to 2800 MeV. It deserves attention, since it could be the 0 \u2212 glueball predicted by Morningstar and Peardon near this mass [2].",

There are three charge states for \u03c1\u03c1, so the relation is normally written g 2 (\u03c1\u03c1) = 3g 2 (\u03c9\u03c9), where g are coupling constants.

Here it is taken as a constant, the simplest possibility. For the numerator, a form factor F F (k) = exp(\u2212\u03b1k 2 ) is used, where k is the momentum of the \u03b7 \u2032 in the overall centre of mass. Good fits are obtained for \u03b1 = 1.5 to 3.0 (GeV/c) \u22122 , consistent with data on J/\u03c8 radiative decays [3]. The form factor arises from convolution of form factors for the outgoing \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 final state and the initial \u03b3\u03b3 interaction. The phase space factor \u03c1 is obtained from the integral over 3-body phase space, given by equations (39. 19) and (39.20) of the Particle Data Book [7].

These values provide an estimate of systematic errors for the mass and width of Y (2300). This extra component allows slightly more freedom in the low mass range considered in the previous section. The significance of the X(1835) contribution falls from 8.2 to 7.1 standard deviations, but there is no essential change to the fit, which is shown by the chain curve in Fig. 2.

In their centre of mass, they have only helicity amplitudes |1, 1 > and |1, \u22121 >, but no |1, 0 > component. If axes are used in the \u03b3\u03b3 rest frame with the z-axis along the direction of the photons, only the x and y components of the spin 2 combination contribute; their intensities add incoherently. To describe the f 2 it is necessary to rotate axes to its direction and then make a Lorentz boost to its rest frame. Using rotation matrices and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is prone to mistakes, but possible. A simpler approach is the so-called method of Wick rotations. Axes are first rotated to the direction of the f 2 using angles \u03b8, \u03c6. After expressing momenta of pions from the f 2 decay in this system, the Lorentz transformation of the pions is made to the f 2 rest frame. Finally, the axes in that frame are rotated back through angles \u2212\u03b8, \u2212\u03c6, taking care that the product of the two rotations is the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix with unit diagonal elements. The two rotation matrices cancel. The Lorentz boost changes the angles of the pions from the f 2 decay between the \u03b3\u03b3 rest frame and the f 2 rest frame, but the usual Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and spherical harmonics give the correct decay amplitude, which also requires the usual centrifugal barrier factors. A check on the procedure is that all amplitudes, including those for \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0\u03c0 used above, are orthogonal when integrated over all angles. If the experimental acceptance is included using the Monte Carlo simulation, the effects of cuts and acceptance are immediately apparent in the interferences between amplitudes. The third method is to use covariant tensor expressions for amplitudes, but this is unfamiliar to most experimentalists.",

Morningstar and Peardon predict that it will have a mass 1.50 \u00b1 0.04 times that of the 0 + glueball and 1.08 \u00b1 0.04 times that of the 2 ++ glueball. A second 0 + glueball is also predicted in this mass range.

There is a new quenched Lattice Gauge calculation of the glueball spectrum by Gregory et al. [13], who give a careful review. The present theoretical situation is that eigenvalues, i.e. masses, have been calculated. These are based on couplings to gluons. What is presently not clear is the effect of decays to qq nonets.

A natural interpretation of the X(1835) is that it is the n = 3 radial excitation of \u03b7(958) (n = 1) and \u03b7(1405/1475) (n = 2). For the latter, the evidence for two separate states is not conclusive; the stronger \u03b7(1475) decays dominantly to KK * (890) in a P-wave, and the k 3 increase of the P-wave shifts the average mass of the peak up by \u223c 35 MeV. Also Wu et al. [15] have proposed an interpretation of \u03b7(1405) in terms of a triangle graph where KK from KK * decay rescatter to \u03b7\u03c0. In J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(\u03b7\u03c0\u03c0), there is a large dispersive peak in Fig.  1(a) at 1500 MeV producing a strong enhancement of \u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0. Achasov and Shestakov suggested in 1985 a natural explanation for a very broad J P C = 0 \u2212 signal observed in J/\u03c8 radiative decays to \u03c1\u03c1 and \u03c9\u03c9 [17]. In a later paper they suggested why \u03b7(1440) and \u03b7(1475) are not observed in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions [18]; further consequences of this suggestion were studied there. A recent third paper reviews the question comprehensively including the latest data and makes recommendations for further work [19].",

The gluon interaction is likely to be of short range, judging by the funnel potential, but mixing with qq components which peak at larger radii reduces the zero-point energy. The sequence of peaks from \u03b7(958) to 2376 MeV lies close to a straight trajectory of M 2 v n with a slope of 1.18 GeV 2 , like that observed in Crystal Barrel data for many resonances, namely 1.143 \u00b1 0.013 GeV 2 [16].",
