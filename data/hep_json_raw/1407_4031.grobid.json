We select events consistent with the single top quark decay process t \u2192 W b \u2192 \u03bdb by requiring the presence of an electron or muon, a large imbalance of transverse momentum indicating the presence of a neutrino, and two or three jets including at least one originating from a bottom quark. An artificial neural network is used to discriminate the signal from backgrounds. We measure a single top quark production cross section of 3.04 +0.57 \u22120.53 pb and set a lower limit on the magnitude of the coupling between the top quark and bottom quark |V tb | > 0.78 at the 95% credibility level. In the standard model (SM) of fundamental interactions, top quarks are produced in hadron collisions primarily as top-antitop (tt) pairs via the strong interaction. The top quark was first observed in this production mode in 1995 [1]. The top quark is also produced singly via weak charged-current interactions. At the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton (pp) collider, single top quark production proceeds via the exchange of a virtual W boson in the t channel, via the decay of an intermediate W boson in the s channel, or in association with a W boson (Wt) [2]. The respective SM production cross sections at the Tevatron, calculated at approximate nextto-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in the strong coupling \u03b1 s , are \u03c3 t \u2248 2.10 pb [3], \u03c3 s \u2248 1.06 pb [4], and \u03c3 Wt \u2248 0.25 pb [5] for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV/c 2 .",

The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported measurements of single top quark production in the t channel in 2012 [12]. More recently, these experiments presented evidence of single top quark production via the Wt process [13], and CMS recently reported the observation of single top quark production via this process [14]. In addition, the CDF and D0 experiments separately reported evidence for s-channel production [15] and jointly reported the observation of s-channel single top quark production in 2014 [16]. The s-channel process is difficult to observe at the LHC due to the small signal-to-background ratio.",

In addition to the E T requirement, we further reduce the non-W background by using a dedicated selection that exploits the W boson transverse mass M W T [24] and the missing transverse energy significance [17]. Events with a reconstructed muon in the tight lepton category are required to have M W T > 10 GeV/c 2 , while the remaining muon events and events triggered by an electron must have M W T > 20 GeV/c 2 . Backgrounds are estimated using both data-driven algorithms and simulated data from Monte Carlo (MC) samples [17]. The diboson and tt processes are modeled using pythia [25], and the production of a W or Z boson associated with jets is modeled using alpgen [26]. The single top quark signal is modeled using powheg [27] at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in \u03b1 s . This measurement uses a NLO generator for the first time to model s-and t-channel single top quark production with the proper inclusion of the Wt contribution [28]. A top quark mass of 172.5 GeV/c 2 is assumed, which is fully consistent with recent measurements [29]. Each of the event generators uses the cteq5l parton distribution functions [30] as input except for powheg, which uses the cteq6.1 parton distribution functions [31]. Parton showering and hadronization is simulated using pythia tuned to underlying event data from the Tevatron [32]. The CDF II detector response is modeled using geant3 [33].",

Three different classes of uncertainty are considered: the uncertainty in the predicted rates of signal and background processes, the uncertainty in the shapes of the distributions of the discriminant variables, and the uncertainty arising from the simulated sample size in each bin of each discriminant distribution. In the pretag sample, discrepancies between data and the MC predictions are visible in certain regions of distributions such as jet \u03b7 and \u2206R( j 1 , j 2 ) = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 , where j 1 and j 2 are the momentum vectors of the two most energetic jets [17] (see Fig. 1). The inaccurate modeling of these distributions is potentially significant because jet-related variables are important inputs to the NN. We determine that the mismodeling is mainly due to W + LF events, and we account for the mismodeling by creating a modified W + LF background template in which events are reweighted to match pretag data in the jet E T , jet \u03b7, and \u2206\u03c6( j 1 , j 2 ) distributions [28].

We study the sensitivity of the resulting fit to the relative contribution of the t-channel and Wt processes (where the Wt contribution is taken to be approximately 10%) and find it to be negligible. The bestfit cross sections correspond to \u03c3 s = 1.81 +0.63 \u22120.58 pb and \u03c3 t+Wt = 1.66 +0.53 \u22120.47 pb, with a correlation factor of -24.3%. The uncertainties on these measurements are correlated because signal from both the s-channel and t-channel + Wt processes populate the signal-like bins of each of our discriminant variables. Regions of 68.3%, 95.5%, and 99.7% credibility are derived by evaluating the smallest region in area that contains the corresponding fractional integrals of the posterior-probability density distribution. The best-fit values, the credibility regions, and the SM predictions are shown in Fig. 3. These measurements are fully compatible with the SM predictions of \u03c3 s = 1.06 \u00b1 0.06 pb and \u03c3 t+Wt = 2.34 \u00b1 0.30 pb [3][4][5].",
