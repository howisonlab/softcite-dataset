The analysis uses 36.7 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the background prediction is observed. Results are interpreted in a SUSY simplified model where the lightest supersymmetric particle is the top squark,t, which decays promptly into two quarks through Rparity-violating couplings. Top squarks with masses in the range 100 GeV < mt < 410 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. If the decay is into a b-quark and a light quark, a dedicated selection requiring two b-tags is used to exclude masses in the ranges 100 GeV < mt < 470 GeV and 480 GeV < mt < 610 GeV. Additional limits are set on the pair-production of massive colour-octet resonances. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

The ME calculation was performed at leading order and, for the top squark signal, includes the emission of up to two additional partons. The merging with the parton shower was done using the CKKW-L [67] prescription, with a merging scale set to one quarter of the pairproduced resonance mass. The PDF set used for the generation is NNPDF23LO. For the top squark signal generation all the non-SM particle masses were set to 5 TeV except for the top squark mass (mt ) itself. The top squark was decayed in Pythia 8 assuming a 100% branching ratio intobs. Its width is expected to be small, and negligible with respect to the detector resolution. This set of samples is also used to interpret the analysis for the case where both top squarks decay into light quarks, since the analysis is not sensitive to the flavour content of the jets. The top squark pair-production cross-sections were calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy [68][69][70]. The nominal cross-section and its uncertainty were taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorisation and renormalisation scales, as described in Ref. [71]. The coloron samples were generated with the model described in Ref. [72], where the couplings of the vector colour octet to all particles except light quarks were set to zero. The LO cross-sections from the event generator were used. The coloron samples are also used to interpret the result in the context of sgluon pair-production, where they are scaled to the sgluon cross-section computed at NLO with MG5_aMC@NLO [73,74]. The sgluons are assumed to decay into two gluons, which in this analysis are not distinguished from quark-initiated jets.",

Figure 3 shows the expected m avg distribution for signal samples with different masses. For each mass hypothesis a counting experiment is performed in a window of the m avg variable optimised to maximise the expected signal significance. The windows range from a 10 GeV width for a 100 GeV top squark to a 200 GeV width for a 1500 GeV coloron. The mass window for the highest target mass considered, of 2000 GeV, has no upper edge. When the mass difference between two signal samples is smaller than the experimental resolution, their selected mass windows partially overlap.",

The shape of the m avg distribution is first predicted in a region with a b-tag veto (zero-tag) and then extrapolated to the b-tagged signal region. The m avg distribution in the zero-tag region is obtained with a data-driven estimate, analogously to the inclusive selection. The zero-tag prediction is then extrapolated to the b-tagged selection by means of projection factors computed bin by bin in m avg , similarly to the approach described in Ref. [44]. The projection factors, for a given m avg bin and region in the A-| cos(\u03b8 * )| plane, are defined as the ratio of the numbers of events with two b-tags and zero b-tags, N two\u2212b\u2212tags /N zero\u2212b\u2212tags , within that region. The method assumes the projection factors to be constant across the A-| cos(\u03b8 * )| plane. They are evaluated in region F, where a negligible signal contamination is expected. The contributions from multi-jet and tt production scale differently between the zero-and b-tagged selection. Hence, simulated samples are used to subtract the tt contribution in all control regions.

In each m avg mass window the difference between the observed data and the estimation in the VR (non-closure) is computed. The larger of the observed non-closure in the VR and the statistical uncertainty of the data-driven method is assigned as an uncertainty in the background estimates. To reduce the effect of statistical fluctuations in the non-closure and avoid quoting an unphysically small value of the systematic uncertainty for the mass windows where it changes sign, this uncertainty is further smoothed as a function of m avg . The Nadaraya-Watson [84,85] kernel regression estimate is used for the smoothing, with a bandwidth of 500 GeV (meaning that the quartiles of the kernels are placed at \u00b1125 GeV).

In addition, the difference in the prediction obtained by modifying the parton-shower intensity and the h damp parameter in the nominal sample is taken as an uncertainty. The tt systematic uncertainty on the total background is as large as 20% for m avg below 200 GeV, becoming negligible above 200 GeV.  The total detector-related uncertainties in the signal are about 10% for the inclusive SR and about 15% for the twob-tagged SR. For top squark production the nominal signal cross-sections and their uncertainties are taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions derived using different PDF sets and different factorisation and renormalisation scales, as described in Ref. [71]. The theoretical uncertainties in the acceptance of the signal simulation include variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales, the CKKW-L merging scales, and the value of the strong coupling constant in MG5_aMC@NLO as well as parton shower uncertainties in Pythia 8 evaluated from variations of the A14 parameter set.

The inclusive signal region is used to set a limit on top squark, sgluon and coloron production with decays into a pair of jets, while the b-tagged signal region is used to interpret the search for top squark pair production with decays into a b-and a light-quark jet. A profile likelihood ratio combining Poisson probabilities for signal and background is computed to determine the 95% CL interval for compatibility of the data with the signal-plus-background hypothesis (CL s+b ) [87]. A similar calculation is performed for the backgroundonly hypothesis (CL b ). From the ratio of these two quantities, the confidence level for the presence of a signal (CL s ) is determined [88]. Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters and are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions. The results are evaluated using pseudo-experiments. This procedure is implemented using a software framework for statistical data analysis, HistFitter [89]. The observed and expected 95% CL upper limits on the allowed cross-sections are shown in Fig. 9. For top squark decays into two quarks, the expected and observed mass range exclusions are between 100 and 430 GeV and between 100 and 410 GeV, respectively. This exclusion does also apply to the pair-production of other squarks, decaying, for example, to a d-and a uquark. If the top squark decay is into a b-quark and a lightquark, masses between 100 and 530 GeV are expected to be excluded, with the observed exclusion ranging from 100 to 470 GeV and from 480 to 610 GeV. Below top squark masses of about 200 GeV the signal acceptance rapidly drops due to the trigger and jet requirements, and the analysis sensitivity does not surpass the 8 TeV result, which was specifically optimised for low-mass signals. Pair-produced scalar gluons with decays into two gluons are excluded up to a mass of 800 GeV. Pair-produced colorons coupling only to light quarks are excluded up to a mass of 1500 GeV.    ground prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in a SUSY simplified model with a top squark as the lightest supersymmetric particle, which is pair-produced and decays promptly into two quarks through R-parity-violating couplings. For decays into two quarks, top squark masses in the range 100 GeV < mt < 410 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. If the top squark decays into a b-quark and a light quark, masses in the ranges 100 GeV < mt < 470 GeV and 480 GeV < mt < 610 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. Limits on the pair production of scalar gluons with decays into two gluons reach masses of 800 GeV. ",
