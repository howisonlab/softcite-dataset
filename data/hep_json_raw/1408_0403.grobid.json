For example, the production cross-sections for cc and bb quark-antiquark pairs are O(1 mb) and O(100 \u00b5b) respectively. Specific values depend on the kinematic region in which the measurement is made, with the production peaking at pseudorapidity values |\u03b7| \u223c 3, and are an increasing function of centre-of-mass energy. Therefore, per fb \u22121 of data collected at, for example, LHCb, over 10 11 bb quark pairs are, in principle, available, with the corresponding number for charm pairs an order of magnitude larger. The number that is actually recorded by each experiment depends critically on the trigger used for online selection.",

Measurements of the properties of heavy flavoured hadrons -including those of states that had not previously been observed -provide tests of the theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), in a regime where it is not well understood. In addition, heavy flavour phenomena such as mixing and rare decays are mediated by loop processes involving virtual particles, and are sensitive to possible non-Standard Model physics at high scales. In fact, precision measurements in the quark sector can be sensitive to new particles with masses much higher than the reach of the LHC collisions. Studies of these processes therefore provide a complementary approach to discover \"new physics\", and form a key part of the LHC programme to search beyond the Standard Model.",

Violation of the combined CP symmetry, that is symmetry under inversion of parity (P ) and of all internal quantum numbers (charge conjugation, C) is a prerequisite for the evolution of an asymmetric Universe. Within the Standard Model, CP violation arises due to a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix [1,2] that describes the relative coupling strengths of the charged-current weak interaction transitions between different flavours of quarks. While this gives a consistent description of all the CP violation effects that have been observed to date, additional sources of asymmetry must exist to explain the observed Universe. One of the highest priorities in contemporary particle physics is to discover new sources of CP violation, which may be present in the quark sector or may be manifest in other areas, for example neutrino oscillations.",

All the LHC detectors have well aligned and calibrated tracking detectors delivering performance close to design expectations. An important performance indicator of the tracking system is the mass resolution for the \u03a5 resonances decaying to the dimuon final state, shown in The key signatures that allow decays of heavy flavoured particles to be distinguished from random combinations of tracks are the presence of muons with comparatively large transverse momentum, and a displaced vertex due to the non-negligible lifetimes of the weakly decaying hadrons. ATLAS and CMS exploit only the former in their online selections, while LHCb makes extensive use in its trigger [9] of information from its vertex locator [10]. This, together with the particle identification capability provided by its ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [11], gives LHCb a broader heavy flavour physics programme than ATLAS and CMS. However, ATLAS and CMS benefit from higher integrated luminosities (\u223c 5 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u223c 20 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collisions collected in 2011 and 2012, respectively, for each experiment) and are therefore highly competitive for final states containing dimuon signatures. LHCb operates at a lower instantaneous luminosity to avoid saturating its trigger and causing over-occupancy of its subdetectors: the corresponding integrated luminosities are 1 fb \u22121 (2011) and 2 fb \u22121 (2012). The LHCb upgrade [12] will enable higher luminosity operation.",

Evidence for this putative J/\u03c8 \u03c6 resonance was reported by the CDF collaboration based on studies of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6K + decay chain [29]. However, a subsequent LHCb study found no evidence for this state and set upper limits on its existence [30]. An analysis by CMS [31] confirmed the existence of a peaking structure in the same region, and in addition found evidence for a second structure with m(J/\u03c8 \u03c6) \u223c 4300 MeV/c 2 , in same decay mode. Further study is needed to clarify whether these structures are resonant in nature.",

The large data samples collected by the LHC experiments has also allowed to explore in detail the properties of the b-baryon sector for the first time. One puzzle from studies at LEP and the Tevatron concerned the lifetime of the \u039b 0 b baryon. Theoretical predictions based on the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) give the ratio of the \u039b 0 b and B 0 lifetimes to be consistent with unity at the level of a few percent [45][46][47]. However, early measurements gave considerably smaller values. ATLAS, CMS and LHCb have all made measurements of this quantity [48][49][50] and find values more consistent with theory. The most precise measurements of the \u039b 0 b lifetime are obtained by LHCb with decays to the J/\u03c8 \u039b [51] and J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 [52] final states. These give \u03c4 (\u039b 0 b ) = 1.468 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.008 ps , within a few percent of the measured B 0 lifetime [53] as predicted by the HQE.",

It is expected to be negligibly small in the Standard Model, but the D0 collaboration has reported an anomalous asymmetry between positive and negative like-sign muon pairs [95]. The effect, which deviates from the Standard Model predictions by 3.6\u03c3, could be caused by non-zero a sl in either or both the B 0 and B 0 s systems. LHCb has measured a sl (B 0 s ) using B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u00b5 + X decays reconstructed in its 2011 data sample [96]. The result is the single most precise measurement of this quantity, and is in agreement with the Standard Model prediction, as are all other measurements of a sl (B 0 ) and a sl (B 0 s ) individually. The current situation is summarised in Fig. 6. Further improvements in precision are needed to shed light on whether the D0 result indicates new physics.",

Historically, this categorisation was important to test so-called \"superweak\" models. Direct CP violation can be observed as a difference in mixing-related CP violating effects in neutral meson decays to different final states, as seen in the kaon system [97,98]. Alternatively, if a sl is known to be small, direct CP violation can be seen in flavour-specific decays of neutral mesons, for example as an asymmetry in the yields of B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays [99,100]. This approach allowed LHCb to make the first observation of CP violation in the B 0 s system through the decay rate asymmetry of B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 s \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, [101,102] A CP (B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 (stat) \u00b1 0.01 (syst) .",

The flavour sector of the Standard Model presents several such features: there are no flavour changing neutral currents at tree-level, vertices involving quarks of different families are suppressed by CKM quark mixing matrix elements, and the V \u2212 A structure of the weak interaction leads to distinctive effects. Rare decays of B mesons to final states containing leptons or photons are particularly useful for Standard Model tests since observables can be calculated with reduced theoretical uncertainty compared to fully hadronic final states.",

The decay rate is suppressed by all three of the features mentioned above, and in particular the helicity suppression due to the V \u2212A structure of the weak interaction is expected to be alleviated in models with extended Higgs sectors, such as supersymmetry. Prior to LHC data taking, experimental limits [126,127] still allowed the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 rate to be enhanced by more than a factor of ten compared to its Standard Model prediction of (3.35\u00b10.28)\u00d710 \u22129 . However, a series of results from LHCb [128][129][130], CMS [131] and ATLAS [132] progressively reduced the phase space for new physics signals. In late 2012, LHCb announced the first evidence for the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay [133], and this was subsequently confirmed by both LHCb [134] and CMS [135] with their full Run I data sets.

Future updates with more statistics are nonetheless of great interest to reduce the uncertainty, to search for the B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay and to test the Standard Model prediction for the effective lifetime of the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay.

Such decays offer a wealth of asymmetries and angular observables that can be studied as functions of the dimuon invariant mass squared, q 2 , several of which have been shown to have reduced theoretical uncertainty. For example, although the absolute values of the branching fractions are hard to predict precisely, isospin and CP asymmetries, between B + and B 0 or B and B decays respectively, provide powerful null tests of the Standard Model. Evidence of isospin asymmetry in B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays [137] has not been confirmed in an update with larger statistics [138], and all CP asymmetry measurements in B \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays are also consistent with zero [139,140].",

In the Standard Model such an asymmetry arises, and varies with q 2 in a predictable way, due to interference between diagrams where the dimuon system is produced by virtual \u03b3 and Z 0 bosons. While previous measurements had shown evidence for a net forward-backward asymmetry when integrated over q 2 [141][142][143], a measurement from LHCb [144], shown in Fig. 9, was the first to pin down the shape of the variation and measure the q 2 at which the asymmetry crosses zero.
