These searches make use of proton-proton collision data, collected during 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the large hadron collider, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 14.7 fb \u22121 . Both searches target the pair production of supersymmetric particles, squarks or gluinos, which decay to final states containing a same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair via one of two mechanisms: a leptonically decaying Z boson in the final state, leading to a peak in the dilepton invariant-mass distribution around the Z boson mass; and decays of neutralinos (e.g.\u03c7 0 2 \u2192 + \u2212\u03c7 0 1 ), yielding a kinematic endpoint in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectation. Results are interpreted in simplified models of gluino-pair (squark-pair) production, and provide sensitivity to gluinos (squarks) with masses as large as 1.70 TeV (980 GeV).",

In this case, strongly interacting sparticles should be produced at a high enough rate to be detected by the experiments at the large hadron collider (LHC). For models with R-parity conservation [12], such sparticles would be pair-produced and are expected to decay into jets, perhaps leptons, and the lightest stable SUSY particle (LSP). The LSP is assumed to be only weakly interacting and therefore escapes the detector, resulting in events with potentially large missing transverse momentum ( p miss T , with magnitude E miss T ).

In this paper, two search channels are considered that target scenarios with same-flavour (SF) opposite-sign (OS) lepton (electron or muon) pairs. The first channel requires a lepton pair with an invariant mass m that is consistent with the Z boson mass m Z (\"on-shell Z \" channel), while the second channel considers all SFOS lepton pairs (\"edge\" channel). The presence of two leptons in the final state suppresses large SM backgrounds from, e.g., QCD multijet and W +jets production, providing a clean environment in which to search for new physics. As discussed further below, in such events the distribution of dilepton mass m may be used to characterise the nature of the SUSY particle decay and constrain mass differences between SUSY particles.",

Fig. 1 Example decay topologies for two of the simplified models considered, involving gluino-pair production, with the gluinos following an effective three-body decay forg \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 2 , with\u03c7 0 2 \u2192 Z ( * )\u03c7 0 1 (left) and\u03c7 0 2 \u2192\u02dc \u2213 \u00b1 /\u03bd\u03bd (right). For simplicity, no distinction is made between particles and antiparticles 3 SUSY signal models SUSY-inspired simplified models are considered as signal scenarios for these analyses. In all of these models, squarks or gluinos are directly pair-produced, decaying via an intermediate neutralino,\u03c7 0 2 , into the LSP (\u03c7 0 1 ). All sparticles not directly involved in the decay chains considered are effectively decoupled. Two example decay topologies are shown in Fig. 1. For all models with gluino-pair production, a threebody decay forg \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 2 is used. Signal models are generated in a grid over a two-dimensional space, varying the gluino or squark mass and the mass of either the\u03c7 0 2 or th\u1ebd \u03c7 0 1 . Three models, one with squark-pair production and two with gluino-pair production, which result exclusively in events with two on-shell Z bosons in the final state are considered for the on-shell search. For two of these models, signal mass points are generated across theg-\u03c7 0 2 (orq\u03c7 0 2 ) plane. These models are produced following the decays g \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 2 orq \u2192 q\u03c7 0 2 , with the\u03c7 0 1 (LSP) mass set to 1 GeV, inspired by SUSY scenarios with a low-mass LSP (e.g. generalised gauge mediation). These two models are referred to here as theg-\u03c7 0 2 on-shell andq-\u03c7 0 2 on-shell grids, respectively, and are summarised in Table 1. The third model is based on MSSM-inspired topologies [25][26][27] with potentially higher mass LSPs. Signal points are generated across theg-\u03c7 0 1 plane, and this model is thus referred to as theg-\u03c7 0 1 on-shell grid. In this case the\u03c7 0 2 mass is set to be 100 GeV above the\u03c7 0 1 mass, which in many models maximises the branching fraction of the\u03c7 0 2 decay to Z bosons. For the two models with gluino-pair production, since the gluino coupling to qq is flavour independent and the corresponding flavours of squarks are assumed to be mass degenerate, the branching fractions for q = u, d, c, s are each 25%. Other ATLAS searches are dedicated to final states with two leptons and heavy flavour jets [28,29]. For the model involving squark-pair production, the superpartners of the u, d, c and s quarks have the same mass, with the superpartners of the b and t quarks being decoupled.",

For m \u03c7 = m(\u03c7 0 2 ) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 1 ) > m Z , the Z boson is on-shell, leading to a peak in the m distribution at m Z , while for m \u03c7 < m Z , the Z boson is off-shell, leading to an edge in the dilepton mass distribution with a position below m Z .

For the slepton model, the masses of the superpartners of the left-handed leptons are set as the average of the\u03c7 0 2 and\u03c7 0 1 masses, while the superpartners of the right-handed leptons are decoupled. The three slepton flavours are mass-degenerate. In both these models theg and\u03c7 0 1 masses are free parameters that are varied to produce the two-dimensional signal grid.

Data events are collected using a combination of singlelepton and dilepton triggers [33], in order to maximise the signal acceptance. The dielectron, dimuon, and electron-muon triggers have leading-lepton p T thresholds in the range 12-24 GeV. Additional single-electron (single-muon) triggers are also used, with trigger p T thresholds of 60 (50) GeV, to increase the trigger efficiency for models with highp T leptons. Events are required to contain at least two selected leptons with p T > 25 GeV, making the selection fully efficient with respect to the trigger p T thresholds.",

For samples generated using Powheg Box V2 [38][39][40], Pythia 6.428 [41] is used to simulate the parton shower, hadronisation, and the underlying event. The CTEQ6L1 PDF set is used with the corresponding Perugia2012 [42] tune. In the case of both the MG5_aMC@NLO and Powheg samples, the EvtGen v1.2.0 program [43] is used for properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. Sherpa 2.1.1 [44] simulated samples use the CT10 PDF set with Sherpa's own internal parton shower [45] and hadronisation methods, as well as the Sherpa default underlying-event tune. Diboson processes with four charged leptons, three charged leptons and a neutrino or two charged leptons and two neutrinos are simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 generator. Matrix elements contain all diagrams with four electroweak vertices. They are calculated for up to one (4 , 2 + 2\u03bd) or zero (3 + 1\u03bd) partons at next-to-leading order in \u03b1 S (NLO) and up to three partons at LO using the Comix [46] and OpenLoops [47] matrix element generators and merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [48]. For the Z /\u03b3 * + jets background, Sherpa 2.1.1 is used to generate a sample with up to two additional partons at NLO and up to four at LO. For Monte Carlo (MC) closure studies, \u03b3 + jets events are generated at LO with up to four additional partons using Sherpa 2.1.1. Additional MC simulation samples of events with a leptonically decaying vector boson and photon (V \u03b3 , where V = W, Z ) are generated at LO using Sherpa 2.1.1. Matrix elements including all diagrams with three electroweak couplings are calculated with up to three partons. These samples are used to estimate backgrounds with real E miss T in \u03b3 + jets event samples. The SUSY signal samples are produced at LO using MG5_aMC@NLO with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set, interfaced with Pythia 8.186. The scale parameter for CKKW-L matching [49,50] is set at a quarter of the mass of the gluino. Up to one additional parton is included in the matrix element calculation. The underlying event is modelled using the A14 tune for all signal samples, and EvtGen is adopted to describe the properties of bottom and charm hadron decays. Signal cross sections are calculated at NLO in \u03b1 S . This includes the resummation of soft gluon emission at nextto-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO+NLL) [51][52][53][54][55].",

The selection criteria for both the baseline and signal objects differ from the requirements used in the Run-1 ATLAS Z +jets+E miss T search reported in Ref. [20], owing to the new silicon-pixel tracking layer and significant changes to the reconstruction software since 2012 data-taking. In particular, improvements in the lepton identification criteria have reduced the background due to hadrons misidentified as electrons.

Calibration corrections are applied to the jets based on a comparison to jets made of stable particles (those with lifetimes \u03c4 > 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 s) in the MC simulation. A residual correction is applied to jets in data, based on studies of p T balance between jets and wellcalibrated objects in the MC simulation and data [80,81]. Baseline jet candidates are required to have p T > 20 GeV and reside within the region |\u03b7| < 4.5. Signal jets are further required to satisfy p T > 30 GeV and reside within the region |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 must meet additional criteria designed to select jets from the hard-scatter interaction and reject those originating from pile-up. This is enforced by using the jet vertex tagger described in Ref. [82]. Finally, events containing a jet that does not pass specific jet quality requirements are vetoed from the analysis selection in order to remove events impacted by detector noise and non-collision backgrounds [83,84]. The MV2c10 boosted decision tree algorithm [85,86] identifies jets with |\u03b7| < 2.5 containing b-hadrons (b-jets) based on quantities such as the impact parameters of associated tracks and any reconstructed secondary vertices. A selection that provides 77% efficiency for tagging b-jets in simulated tt events is used. These tagged jets are called b-tagged jets.",

[20] an \"on-Z \" SR, denoted SRZ, is defined requiring E miss T > 225 GeV and H incl T > 600 GeV. The region is motivated by SUSY signals with high gluino or squark mass and high jet activity. Since b-jets are not always expected in the simplified models considered here, no requirement is placed on b-tagged jet multiplicity (n b\u2212jets ) so as to be as inclusive as possible and to be consistent with Ref.

Three regions are defined to target signal models with low, medium and high values of mg = m(g) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 1 ), denoted SR-low, SR-medium, and SR-high, respectively. All these regions require E miss T > 200 GeV. SR-medium and SR-high also include the requirements H T > 400 GeV and H T > 700 GeV, respectively, to further isolate highmg events. Here the leptons are not included in the H T definition to avoid introducing any bias in the m distribution. Events selected in SR-low, SR-medium and SR-high are further grouped into non-orthogonal m windows, which represent the search regions used in the edge analysis. The dilepton mass ranges of these are chosen to maximise sensitivity to the targeted signal models, with the window boundaries being motivated by the dilepton mass endpoints of generated signal points. In total, 24 m windows are defined by selecting ranges with the best expected sensitivity to signal models. Of these windows, nine are in SR-low, eight are in SR-medium and seven are in SR-high. Details of the m definitions in these regions are given along with the results in Sect. 9. Models without light sleptons are targeted by windows with m < 60 GeV or m < 80 GeV for m \u03c7 < m Z leading to off-shell Z bosons, and by the window with 81 < m < 101 GeV for m \u03c7 > m Z leading to on-shell Z bosons.

The difference in resolution between photons, electrons, and muons can be significant at high p T . Therefore, before the \u03c6(jet 12 , p miss T ) > 0.4 requirement is applied, the photon p T is smeared according to a Z \u2192 ee or Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc resolution function. The smearing function is derived by comparing the E miss T -projection along the boson momentum in Z /\u03b3 * + jets and \u03b3 + jets MC events in a 1-jet control region with no other event-level kinematic requirements. A deconvolution is applied to avoid including the photon resolution in the Z resolution. For each event, a photon p T smearing p T is obtained by sampling the smearing function. The photon p T is shifted by p T , with the parallel component of the E miss T being correspondingly adjusted by \u2212 p T .",

The real-lepton efficiency, real , is measured in Z \u2192 data events using a tag-and-probe method in CR-real, defined in Table 4. In this region the p T of the leading lepton is required to be >40 GeV, and only events with exactly two SFOS leptons are selected. The fake-lepton efficiency, fake , is measured in CR-fake, a region enriched with fake leptons by requiring same-sign lepton pairs. The lepton p T requirements are the same as those in CR-real, with the leading lepton being tagged as the \"real\" lepton and the fake efficiency being evaluated based on the sub-leading lepton in the event. An E miss T requirement of <125 GeV is used to reduce possible contamination from Beyond Standard Model processes. In this region the background due to promptlepton production, estimated from MC simulation, is subtracted from the total data contribution. Prompt-lepton production makes up 7% (11%) of the baseline electron (muon) sample and 10% (61%) of the signal electron (muon) sample in CR-fake. From the resulting data sample the fraction of events in which the baseline leptons pass a signallike selection yields the fake efficiency.

The rare top processes compose <5% of the expected SM background in the SRs and are taken directly from MC simulation. Production of W Z/Z Z dibosons constitutes about 30% of the expected background in SRZ and up to 20% in some edge SR m windows.

To validate the MC modelling of these backgrounds, VRs with three leptons (VR-WZ) and four leptons (VR-ZZ) are defined (selection shown in Table 3). In VR-WZ, from the three selected leptons in an event, the SFOS pair with m most consistent with the Z mass is indentified as the Z candidate. The transverse mass of the remaining lepton and the E miss T , m T ( 3 , E miss T ), is then required to be <100 GeV, forming the W candidate. In VR-ZZ an E miss T < 100 GeV requirement is used to suppress W Z and top processes. The yields and kinematic distributions observed in these regions are wellmodelled by MC simulation. In particular, the E miss T , H T , jet multiplicity, and boson p T distributions show good agreement. An additional three-lepton VR (VR-3L) is defined to provide validation of the diboson background in a region of phase space closer to the SR; good agreement is observed in this region as well.",

The boson p T reweighting procedure is assigned an uncertainty based on a comparison of the nominal results with those obtained by reweighting using three other kinematic variables, namely H T , Z -boson E T and jet multiplicity. For the smearing function, which is measured using MC events in a 1-jet control region, an uncertainty is derived by comparing the results obtained using the nominal smearing function with those obtained using a smearing function from a 2-jet sample of MC events, and also using a smearing function measured in a 1-jet data sample. An uncertainty of between 40-100% is assigned to account for different reweighting procedures and between 20-100% for the smearing procedure applied to \u03b3 +jets events. The smearing uncertainty dominates in SR-high, while the reweighting uncertainty dominates in SR-low and SR-medium, with both being around 60% in SRZ. The full reweighting and smearing procedure is carried out using \u03b3 + jets MC events such that an MC non-closure uncertainty can be derived by comparing the resulting \u03b3 + jets MC E miss T distribution to that in Z /\u03b3 * + jets MC events. The resulting uncertainty of up to 35% is calculated in the VRs, so as to maximise the number of events that contribute. An uncertainty of 16% is assessed for the V \u03b3 backgrounds, based on data-to-MC agreement in a V \u03b3 -enriched control region. This uncertainty is propagated to the final Z /\u03b3 * + jets estimate following the subtraction of the V \u03b3 background. In VR-low, a correction is applied to the E miss T distribution in \u03b3 + jets events to account for the fraction of Z /\u03b3 * + jets events in this H T -inclusive region expected to have boson p T less than 37 GeV. The full size of this correction (up to 50% for E miss T = 150 GeV) is applied as a systematic uncertainty. The m distribution assigned to \u03b3 + jets MC events is compared to that of Z /\u03b3 * + jets MC events, and the relative difference in a given m bin is assigned as an uncertainty. Finally, the statistical precision of the estimate also enters as a systematic uncertainty of \u223c10% in the final background estimate. After applying the correction procedure, differences in the number of b-tagged jets between Z /\u03b3 * + jets and \u03b3 + jets are found to be negligible, indicating good agreement in heavy-flavour content.",

For regions in which the data yield is less than expected, the discovery p value is truncated at 0.5 and the significance is set to zero. The flavour-symmetric, Z /\u03b3 * + jets and fake-lepton components are all derived using data-driven estimates described in Sect. 7. All remaining backgrounds are taken from MC simulation. The quoted uncertainties include statistical and systematic contributions. The individual uncertainties can be correlated and do not necessarily add up in quadrature to the total systematic uncertainty  [51][52][53][54][55], and the resulting uncertainties range from 16 to 30%. A breakdown of the dominant uncertainties in the background prediction in the SRs is provided in Table 8 for the on-shell Z and edge searches. Here these uncertainties are quoted relative to the total background. In the case of the edge regions a range is quoted, taking into account the relative contribution of the given uncertainty in each of the m ranges in SR-low, SR-medium and SR-high. The largest uncertainties in the signal regions are due to the size of the e\u03bc data sample in CR-FS, used to provide the flavour-symmetric background estimate, the combined systematic uncertainty in the same background, the systematic uncertainty in \u03b3 + jets, or, in the case of SRZ, the W Z/Z Z generator uncertainty. The statistical component of the uncertainty from the flavour-symmetry estimate is largest for the edge analysis in SR-medium and SR-high in the highest m regions. In the edge SRs the uncer-tainty in the W Z/Z Z background tends to be highest in the m ranges that include the Z window. The uncertainty in the fake-lepton background is largest in SR-high, where fake leptons can compose a larger fraction of the background. Experimental uncertainties have a far lower impact on the systematic uncertainty of the total background (<2%).",

Far from the exclusion boundary, although the signal contamination can be significant, the number of events appearing in the signal region is large enough that the points are still excluded, due to the relative branching fractions for the signal in the CR and SR. For example, for models with signal contamination of 50% in CR-FS the signal-to-background ratio in SRZ is \u223c10.",

The first search (onshell Z search) targets lepton pairs consistent with Z boson decay, while the second search (edge search) targets a kinematic endpoint feature in the dilepton mass distribution. For the edge search, a set of 24 mass ranges are considered, with different requirements on E miss T and H T , and different kinematic endpoint values in the dilepton invariant-mass distribution. The data in both searches are found to be consistent with the Standard Model prediction. The results are interpreted in simplified models of gluino-pair production and squark-pair production, and exclude gluinos (squarks) with masses as large as 1.7 TeV (980 GeV).  ",

The shape of the Z /\u03b3 * + jets m distribution is extracted from MC simulation and validated by comparing to data in events with lower E miss T requirements and a veto on b-tagged jets, to suppress the background from tt. The m distribution is modelled by parameterising the m in Z /\u03b3 * + jets events as a function of the difference between reconstructed and true Z boson p T in MC simulation. This parameterization ensures that the correlation between lepton momentum mismeasurement and observed m values far from the Z boson mass is preserved. Each photon event is assigned an m via a random sampling of the corresponding distribution, equating photon p T and the difference between true and reconstructed Z boson p T .
