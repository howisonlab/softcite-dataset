The measurement is presented in the form of distributions of azimuthal-angle differences, \u2206\u03c6, between the Mueller-Navelet jets, the average cosines of (\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6), 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6), and 3(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6), and ratios of these cosines. The jets are required to have transverse momenta, p T , in excess of 35 GeV and rapidities, |y|, of less than 4.7. The results are presented as a function of the rapidity separation, \u2206y, between the Mueller-Navelet jets, reaching \u2206y up to 9.4 for the first time. The results are compared to predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators and to analytical predictions based on the DGLAP and BFKL parton evolution schemes.",

In a kinematic region where semi-hard parton interactions are important, the azimuthal decorrelation will increase with increasing \u2206y = |y 1 \u2212 y 2 | between the jets [10,11], where y 1 and y 2 are rapidities of the most forward and the most backward jets (Mueller-Navelet jets, MN)  [9]. The large LHC centre-of-mass energy, and the large pseudorapidity coverage of the detectors, allows multijet production to be explored in a region of \u2206y that was previously kinematically inaccessible. The BFKL approach was derived in the infiniteenergy limit using the leading-logarithm (LL) approximation. At finite energy, the BFKL approach can be significantly improved using the next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) approximation [12][13][14][15], which incorporates further elements like energy-momentum conservation and correlations at small rapidities.",

If there are only two jets in the final state, they have to be approximately back-to-back in the azimuthal plane (\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0) and the average cosines equal unity: cos(n(\u03c0\u2212\u2206\u03c6)) = 1. Due to parton radiation, the (\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6) distribution has a non-zero width that is determined by Fourier harmonics involving cos(n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6)) . In the BFKL approach, an increasing rapidity interval between the MN jets leads to an increased number of emitted partons and thus to an increased azimuthal decorrelation: cos(n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6)) < 1. In the DGLAP picture within the LL approximation, in contrast, the partons emitted between the MN jets have much lower p T than the latter, and their emission does not depend on their rapidity separation. Hence, parton emissions from the parton cascade can change the azimuth of the parent partons to a much lesser extent than in the BFKL approach where the p T of mother and daughter partons can be very similar. However, when the MN jets are not the jets with the highest p T , then even in the DGLAP picture a significant decorrelation might be observed.",

[10,11,20,[22][23][24][25]. In addition, the ratios of the average cosines C 2 /C 1 and C 3 /C 2 are measured, as proposed in refs. [20,[23][24][25]. To cover all available \u2206y space, \u2206\u03c6 distributions are measured in three bins of rapidity separation: \u2206y < 3.0, 3.0 < \u2206y < 6.0, and 6.0 < \u2206y < 9.4. The average cosines may be expressed explicitly using conformal symmetries of the BFKL evolution equation [14], which are absent in the DGLAP evolution equation. Moreover, since one expects a suppression of DGLAP contributions in the two ratios [23], they are particularly sensitive to manifestations of BFKL effects. In addition, uncertainties related to the factorisation and renormalisation scales are reduced in the ratios [26].",

In the mentioned generators, different models are used for the simulation of multiparton interactions and hadronisation. The parameters of multiparton interactions in these tunes are adjusted to best describe LHC data. The MC generator powheg [34][35][36]-using the cteq6m parton distribution function [37], and interfaced with pythia 6 and 8 -is used to investigate the sensitivity of the measured jet observables to the contribution of next-to-leading-order (NLO) terms. The measurements are also compared to the DGLAP-based MC generator sherpa 1.4 [38], which uses tree-level matrix elements for 2 \u2192 2 + n-jets (with n = 0, 1, -3 -JHEP08 (2016)1392 in this work) matched to LL parton showers. Finally, data-theory comparisons are also performed using the analytical NLL BFKL predictions as obtained in ref. [39] at parton level, as well as with predictions obtained from the hej+ariadne generator package (version 0.99b) [40]. The latter consists of hej version 1.3.2 [41], which is based on LL BFKL matrix elements, and the hadronisation and parton-shower package of ariadne 4.12 [42].",

At large values of the rapidity separation (\u2206y 8), additional emissions are becoming kinematically suppressed due to energy-momentum conservation near the phase space boundary (\u2206y \u2248 10), resulting in an increase of the average cosines towards unity.

The measured observables include azimuthal-angle distributions, moments of the average cosines of the decorrelation angle, cos(n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6)) for n = 1, 2, 3, as well as ratios of the average cosines, as a function of the rapidity separation \u2206y between the MN jets.",
