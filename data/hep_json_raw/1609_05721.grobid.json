Differential cross sections with respect to the Z boson p T , the leading jet p T , and the number of jets are obtained using the \u221a s = 8 TeV data. The results are consistent with standard model predictions and constraints on anomalous triple gauge couplings are obtained.",

            "text": "The measurement of the production of electroweak heavy vector boson pairs (diboson production) in proton-proton collisions represents an important test of the standard model (SM) description of electroweak and strong interactions at the TeV scale. Diboson production is sensitive to the selfinteractions between electroweak gauge bosons as predicted by the SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y gauge structure of electroweak interactions. Triple and quartic gauge couplings (TGCs and QGCs) can be affected by new physics phenomena involving new particles at higher energy scales. The WZ cross section measured in this paper is sensitive to WWZ couplings, which are non-zero in the SM. WZ production also represents an important background in several searches for physics beyond the SM, such as the search for the SM Higgs boson [1], searches for new resonances [2,3], or supersymmetry [4][5][6][7].",

The measurements use purely leptonic final states in which the Z boson decays into a pair of electrons or muons, and the W boson decays into a neutrino and an electron or a muon. At leading order (LO) within the SM, WZ production in proton-proton collisions occurs through quark-antiquark interactions in the s-, t-, and u-channels, as illustrated by the Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 1. Among them, only the s-channel includes a TGC vertex. Our measured final states also include contributions from diagrams where the Z boson is replaced with a virtual photon (\u03b3 * ) and thus include W\u03b3 * production. We refer to the final states as WZ production because the Z contribution is dominant for the phase space of this measurement. Hadron collider WZ production has been previously observed at both the Tevatron [8,9] and the LHC [10][11][12][13][14][15].",

Using the larger integrated luminosity collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV, we also present measurements of the differential cross section as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum p T , the number of jets produced in association with the WZ pair, and the p T of the leading associated jet.

The search is formulated both in the framework of anomalous couplings and in an effective field theory approach. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.50. The ECAL provides coverage in |\u03b7| < 1.48 in a barrel region and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.00 in two endcap regions. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.40.",

The tt, tW, and qq \u2192 ZZ processes are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) with powheg 2.0 [19][20][21]. The gg \u2192 ZZ process is simulated at leading order (one loop) with gg2zz [22]. Other background processes are generated at LO with MadGraph and include Z +jets, W\u03b3 * (with m \u03b3 * < 12 GeV), Z\u03b3 as well as processes with at least three bosons in the decay chain comprised of WZZ, ZZZ, WWZ, WWW, ttW, ttZ, ttWW, tt\u03b3 and WW\u03b3 , collectively referred to as VVV. For the modeling of anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs), the NLO mcfm 6.3 [23] Monte Carlo program is used to compute weights that are applied to the WZ signal sample generated with MadGraph. In all samples, the parton-level events are interfaced with pythia 6.426 [24] to describe parton showering, hadronization, fragmentation, and the underlying event with the Z2* tune [25]. For LO generators, the default set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) used is CTEQ6L1 [26], while NLO CT10 [27] is used with NLO generators. For all processes, the detector response is simulated with a detailed description of the CMS detector, based on the Geant4 package [28]. The event reconstruction is performed with the same algorithms as are used for data. The simulated samples include additional interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). Simulated events are weighted so the pileup distribution in the simulation matches the one observed in data.",

Their identification relies on a multivariate regression technique that combines observables sensitive to the amount of bremsstrahlung along the electron trajectory, the geometrical and momentum matching between the electron trajectory in the tracker and the energy deposit in the calorimeter, as well as the shower shape. Muons are reconstructed using information from both the tracker and the muon spectrometer [32]. They must satisfy requirements on the number of hits in the layers of the tracker and in the muon spectrometer, and on the quality of the full track fit. All lepton candidates are required to be consistent with the primary vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with the highest p 2 T of its associated tracks. This criterion provides the correct assignment for the primary vertex in more than 99% of both signal and background events for the pileup distribution observed in data.

Consequently, the selected leptons are required to be isolated from other activity in the event to reduce the backgrounds from hadrons that are misidentified as leptons or from leptons produced in hadron decays when they occur inside or near hadronic jets. The separation between two reconstructed objects in the detector is measured with the variable R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 , where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. To measure the lepton isolation, we consider a R = 0.3 cone around the lepton candidate track direction at the event vertex. An isolation variable is then built as the scalar p T sum of all PF objects consistent with the chosen primary vertex, and contained within the cone. The contribution from the lepton candidate itself is excluded. For both electrons and muons a correction is applied to account for the energy contribution in the isolation cone due to pileup. In the case of electrons, the average energy density in the isolation cone due to pileup is determined event-by-event and is used to correct the isolation variable [33]. For muons, the pileup contribution from neutral particles to the isolation is estimated using charged particles associated with pileup interactions. This isolation variable is required to be smaller than about 10% of the candidate lepton p T . The exact threshold value depends on the lepton flavour and detector region, and also on the data taking period: for 7 TeV data, it is 13% (9%) for electrons measured in the ECAL barrel (endcaps) and 12% for muons, while for 8 TeV data it is 15% for all electrons. For muons, a modified strategy has been used for 8 TeV data to account for the higher pileup conditions in order to reduce the dependence of this variable on the number of pileup interactions. It uses a multivariate algorithm based on the p T sums of particles around the lepton candidates built for R cones of different sizes [1].",

The tight selection is identical to the one used in the final selection, while some of the lepton identification requirements used in the final selection are relaxed in the loose selection. The procedure starts from a sample, called the loose sample, with three leptons passing loose identification criteria and otherwise satisfying all other requirements of the WZ selection.

This yield is n ppp p 1 p 2 p 3 . The number of events with three prompt leptons in the loose sample, n ppp , is obtained by solving the set of linear Eq. (2). Independent samples are used to measure the efficiencies p and n [38]. The prompt lepton efficiency p is obtained from a Z \u2192 sample, while the nonprompt lepton efficiency n is measured using a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet sample. Events in this sample are triggered by a single lepton. The lepton selection used in these triggers is looser than the loose lepton selection referred to earlier in this section. The leading jet in the event is required to be well separated from the triggering lepton and have a transverse momentum larger than 50 GeV for the 7 TeV data sample, and larger than 35 20GeV for the 8 TeV sample if the triggering lepton is an electron (muon). Events with leptons from Z decays are rejected by requiring exactly one lepton in the final state. To reject events with leptons from W decays, both the missing transverse energy and the W transverse mass are required to be less than 20 GeV. This selection provides a clean sample to estimate the nonprompt lepton efficiency. Both efficiencies p and n are measured in several lepton ( p T , \u03b7) bins. For 7 TeV (8 TeV) data, the measured nonprompt efficiencies for leptons are in the range 1-6% (1-10%), while they are in the range 1-5% (7-20%) for muons. The measured prompt efficiencies lie between 60 and 95% for electrons, and between 71 and 99% for muons for both the 7 and 8 TeV data samples. Table 1 Expected and observed event yields at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV.

Backgrounds with at least three bosons in the decay chain com-prised of WZZ, ZZZ, WWZ, WWW, ttW, ttZ, ttWW, tt\u03b3 and WW\u03b3 events, are referred to as VVV. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown, except for the WZ signal where only statistical uncertainties are shown The number of events with nonprompt leptons in each final state obtained with this method is given in Table 1. While these results include the contribution of events with any number of misidentified leptons, simulation studies show that the contribution from backgrounds with two or three misidentified leptons, such as W+jets or QCD multijet processes, is negligible, so the nonprompt lepton background is completely dominated by tt and Z+jets processes.",

The effect of the muon momentum scale is estimated by varying the momentum of each muon in the simulated signal sample within the momentum scale uncertainty, which is 0.2% [32]. The same is done for electrons by varying the energy of reconstructed electrons within the uncertainty of the energy scale measurement, which is p T and \u03b7 dependent and is typically below 1%. The signal efficiency sig also depends on the uncertainties in the ratios of observedto-simulated efficiencies of the lepton trigger, reconstruction, and identification requirements. These ratios are used in the determination of sig to account for efficiency differences between data and simulation. They are varied within their uncertainties, which depend on the lepton p T and \u03b7 and are about 1%. The uncertainty from the E miss T calibration is determined by scaling up and down the energy of all objects used for the E miss T determination within their uncertainties. Finally, sig is affected by the uncertainty in the pileup contribution. Simulated events are reweighted to match the distribution of pileup interactions, which is estimated using a procedure that extracts the pileup from the instantaneous bunch luminosity and the total inelastic pp cross section. The weights applied to simulated events are changed by varying this cross section by 5% uncertainty [40].",

The expected p Z T spectrum for some aTGC values is obtained by  Fig. 8 Two-dimensional observed 95% CL limits and expected 68, 95 and 99% CL limits on anomalous coupling parameters \u03ba Z and g Z 1 normalizing the MadGraph events to the expected NLO SM cross section from mcfm, and then reweighting them to the expected cross section for that particular aTGC scenario, as obtained with MCFM, based on the generated value of p Z T . Samples for three 2D anomalous parameter grids are generated, \u03bb versus \u03ba Z , \u03bb versus g Z 1 , and \u03ba Z versus g Z 1 , where the third parameter is set to its SM value. The expected yield of the anomalous coupling signal in every p Z T bin is parametrized by a second-order polynomial as a function of two aTGC parameters for every channel. The observed p Z T spectrum is shown in Fig. 7 together with the expected spectra for a few different aTGC scenarios. A simultaneous fit to the values of aTGCs is performed [58] in all four lepton channels. A profile likelihood method, Wald gaussian approximation, and Wilks' theorem [59] are used to derive 1D and 2D limits at a 95% confidence level (CL) on each of the three aTGC parameters and every combination of two aTGC parameters, respectively, while all other parameters are set to their SM values. No significant deviation from the SM expectation is observed. Results can be found in Tables 8  and 9, and in Figs. 8, 9, and 10. Limits on aTGC parameters were previously set by LEP [60], ATLAS [11,14] and CMS [15]. LHC analyses using 8 TeV data are setting most stringent limits. Results in this paper show sensitivity similar to the results given by the ATLAS Collaboration in the same channel [11].",
