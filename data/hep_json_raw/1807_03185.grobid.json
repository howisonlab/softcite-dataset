In order to reach these goals, a study of hadron production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei. In this paper, I will review recent results on strangeness production in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions in the SPS energy range. Kinematic spectra and mean multiplicities of kaons obtained with various analysis methods will be shown. An overview of strangeness production and its dependence on system size in the vicinity of the phase transition will be presented as well.",

In the QGP phase, due to the lower mass of strange quarks (m s < T ), the strangeness yield becomes approximately proportional to the entropy (both \u221d T 3 ) and the strangeness to entropy production ratio becomes constant with energy. Therefore we expect a \"jump\" in the energy dependence from the quickly increasing strangeness yield for confined matter to the equilibrium value expected for deconfined matter. The non-monotonic energy dependence of the strangeness to entropy production ratio followed by a plateau at higher energies is expected as a direct consequence of the onset of deconfinement. Exact calculations within the SMES model [2] show higher values of the discussed ratio in the hadronic medium at the onset of deconfinement resulting in a very specific shape of the energy dependence, called the \"horn\".

The key observation is the clear qualitative difference between the results on small nuclei collisions (p+p, Be+Be) and those of larger sizes (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb). In particular, the measurements of transverse spectra and the K + /\u03c0 + ratio (at y\u22480) for Be+Be collisions fall very close to the results obtained for p+p, while the K + / \u03c0 + ratio (in 4\u03c0 acceptance) measured for Ar+Sc collisions falls closer to the results from Pb+Pb interactions.",

This leads to the question whether there might be a microscopic phenomenon leading to such a clear distinction between lighter (p+p, Be+Be) and heavier (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb) systems. One may hypothesize that in the first case we seem to observe reactions of independent binary N+N collisions, while in the latter the system evolves collectively as a whole. Figure 5 shows a schematic picture of the two onsets present in heavy-ion collisions: the onset of deconfinement and the the onset of fireball. We can distinguish four hypothetical domains in which hadron production properties should differ significantly.",
