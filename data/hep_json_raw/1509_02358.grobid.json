Three differential measurements are performed as a function of the invariant mass, transverse momentum and longitudinal boost of the tt system. The tt pairs are selected in the single-lepton channels (e or \u03bc) with at least four jets, and a likelihood fit is used to reconstruct the tt event kinematics. A Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to infer the asymmetry at parton level from the observed data distribution. The inclusive tt charge asymmetry is measured to be A C = 0.009 \u00b1 0.005 (stat. + syst.). The inclusive and differential measurements are compatible with the values predicted by the Standard Model. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

            "text": "The 8 TeV proton-proton ( pp) collision data delivered by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) represents a unique laboratory for precision measurements of the top-quark properties. One interesting feature of tt production is the difference in rapidity between top quarks and top antiquarks. In pp collisions, this distinct behaviour of top quarks and antiquarks is called the charge asymmetry, A C [defined in Eq. (1)]. The Standard Model (SM) expectation computed at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), including electroweak corrections, predicts A C to be at the one percent level [1]. Previous asymmetry measurements at the LHC by both the CMS and ATLAS collaborations based on the 7 TeV data, and by the CMS collaboration based on the 8 TeV data, do not report any significant deviation from the SM predictions [2][3][4][5][6][7]. Charge asymmetry measurements are largely limited by the size of the available data sample, and therefore the larger dataset recorded by the ATLAS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV allows for an improvement on the precision of the measurement from the \u221a s = 7 TeV dataset.",

In pp collisions at the LHC, since the colliding beams are symmetric, it is not possible to use the direction of the incoming quark to define an asymmetry. However, valence quarks carry on average a larger fraction of the proton momentum than sea antiquarks, hence top quarks are more forward and top antiquarks are more central. Using this feature it is possible to define a forward-central asymmetry for the tt production, referred to as the charge asymmetry, A C [8,12,13]:",

Several processes beyond the Standard Model (BSM) can alter A C [12,[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25], either with anomalous vector or axialvector couplings (e.g. axigluons) or via interference with SM processes. Different models also predict different asymmetries as a function of the invariant mass m tt , the transverse momentum p T,tt and the longitudinal boost \u03b2 z,tt along the z-axis 1 of the tt system [26]. The interest in precisely measuring charge asymmetries in top-quark pair production at the LHC has grown after the CDF and D0 collaborations reported measurements of A FB that were significantly larger than the SM predictions, in both the inclusive and differential case as a function of m tt and of the rapidity of the tt system, y tt [10,11,[27][28][29][30]. For the most general BSM scenarios [31], the A C measurements from the LHC are still compatible with the Tevatron results. However, for specific simple models [20], tension still exists between the LHC and Tevatron results. This motivates the interest in a more precise measurement of the tt production charge asymmetry at the LHC.",

The inner detector (ID) is composed of three subsystems: the pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker and the transition radiation tracker. The ID provides tracking information in the pseudorapidity 2 range |\u03b7| < 2.5, calorimeters measure energy deposits (clusters) for |\u03b7| < 4.9, and the muon spectrometer records tracks within |\u03b7| < 2.7. A three-level trigger system [34] is used to select interesting events. It consists of a level-1 hardware trigger, reducing the event rate to at most 75 kHz, followed by two software-based trigger levels, collectively referred to as the high-level trigger, yielding a recorded event rate of approximately 400 Hz on average, depending on the datataking conditions.",

The corrections are obtained from simulations of charged and neutral particles and validated with data. After energy calibration [43], jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jets from additional simultaneous pp interactions (pileup) are suppressed by requiring that the absolute value of the jet vertex fraction (JVF) 4 for candidates with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 is above 0.5 [44]. All highp T electrons are also reconstructed as jets, so the closest jet within R = 0.2 of a selected electron is discarded to avoid double counting of electrons as jets.

To avoid double counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower, a parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [73] is employed. The W +jets samples are generated separately for W +light-jets, W bb+jets, W cc+jets, and W c+jets. The Z +jets samples are generated separately for Z +light-jets, Zbb+jets, and Zcc+jets. Overlap between W/Z QQ+jets (Q = b, c) events generated from the matrix-element calculation and those generated from parton-shower evolution in the W/Z +light-jets samples is avoided via an algorithm based on the angular separation between the extra heavy quarks: if R(Q,Q) > 0.4, the matrix-element prediction is used, otherwise the parton-shower prediction is used. The Z +jets background is normalised to its inclusive NNLO theoretical cross section [74], while data is used to normalise W +jets (see below for details). Further corrections are applied to Z +jets simulated events in order to better describe data in the preselected sample. A correction to the heavyflavour fraction was derived to reproduce the relative rates of Z +2-jets events with zero and one b-tagged jets observed in data. In addition, the Z boson p T spectrum was compared between data and the simulation in Z +2-jets events, and a reweighting function was derived in order to improve the modelling as described in Ref. [75].",

This is due to the higher density of u quarks in protons with respect to d quarks, which causes more ud \u2192 W + to be produced than d\u016b \u2192 W \u2212 . The W boson charge asymmetry is then defined as the difference between the numbers of events with a single positive or negative lepton divided by the sum. The prediction for the W boson charge asymmetry in W +jets production is little affected by theoretical uncertainties and can be exploited, in combination with constraints from W + and W \u2212 data samples, to derive the correct overall normalisation for the MC sample prediction. The W boson charge asymmetry depends on the flavour composition of the sample, as the size and sign of the asymmetry varies for W bb+jets, W cc+jets, W c+jets, and W +light-jets production. The in situ calibration procedure embedded in the unfolding and described in Sect. 6.4, uses different signal and control regions to determine the normalisation of the W +jets background.",

For this purpose, two samples are defined after imposing the event selection described in Sect. 4, differing only in the lepton identification criteria: a \"tight\" sample and a \"loose\" sample, the former being a subset of the latter. The tight selection employs the final lepton identification criteria used in the analysis. For the loose selection, the lepton isolation requirements are omitted for both the muon and electron channels, and the quality requirements are also loosened for the electron channel. The method assumes that the number of selected events in each sample (N loose and N tight ) can be expressed as a linear combination of the numbers of events with real and fake leptons, so that the number of multijet events in the tight sample is given by",

The bottom part of each plot shows the ratio of the data to the predicted value together with combined statistical and systematic uncertainties egories of nuisance parameters are considered: the normalisation of the background processes (\u03b8 b ), and the uncertainties associated with the object identification, reconstruction and calibration (\u03b8 s ). While the first ones only affect the background predictions, the latter, referred to as object systematic uncertainties, affect both the reconstructed distribution for tt signal and the total background prediction. The W +jets calibration factors are found to be K bb/cc = 1.50 \u00b1 0.11, K c = 1.07\u00b10.27 and K light = 0.80\u00b10.04, where the uncertainties include both the statistical and systematic components.

These yields are shown after marginalisation of the nuisance parameters and the in situ calibration of the W +jets background, and the marginalized uncertainties are shown. The marginalized uncertainties for each background and signal component are correlated, and the correlation is taken into account in their combination parameters and W +jets in situ calibration are listed in Table 1, while Fig. 2 shows the good level of agreement between the data and expectation before and after marginalisation for the six channels. In both cases, the uncertainties that are marginalized are shown. Since these uncertainties are correlated for the background and signal components, the total combined marginalized uncertainty is smaller than the sum of the constituent parts.",

Instead, the expected impact of systematic uncertainties is studied with pseudo-data distributions corresponding to the sum of the background and signal predictions. For each source of uncertainty, the \u00b11\u03c3 variations of the predictions are used to build the pseudodata, and the unfolding procedure is repeated. The baseline background templates and response matrices, as in the actual measurements, are used. Table 2 shows the average asymmetry variation \u03b4 A C computed, for each source of uncertainty, as |A C (+1\u03c3 ) \u2212 A C (\u22121\u03c3 )|/2, but only the uncertainties having a variation above 10 % of the statistical uncertainty are reported in the table. The total uncertainty associated with the marginalised systematic uncertainties is estimated by subtracting in quadrature the statis- tical term from the total marginalised uncertainty. It yields 0.002 (category (a) in Table 2). The total, non-marginalised uncertainty associated with systematic uncertainties is estimated by summing in quadrature sources from category (b) in Table 2. The precision of the measurement is limited by the statistical uncertainty, and the main sources of systematic uncertainty are the signal modelling and the uncertainties with a large impact on the size of the W +jets background, such as the uncertainty on the jet energy scale and resolution.",

            "text": "The top-quark pair production charge asymmetry was measured with pp collisions at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV in tt events with a single lepton (electron or muon), at least four jets and large missing transverse momentum. The reconstruction of tt events was performed using a kinematic fit. The reconstructed inclusive distribution of |y| and the distributions as a function of m tt , p T,tt and \u03b2 z,tt were unfolded to obtain results that can be directly compared to theoretical computations. The measured inclusive tt production charge asymmetry is A C = 0.009 \u00b1 0.005 (stat.+ syst.), to be compared to the SM prediction A C = 0.0111 \u00b1 0.0004 [1]. All measurements presented in this paper are statistically limited and are found to be compatible with the SM prediction within the uncertainties. The precision of the measurements also allows for the exclusion of a large phase-space of the parameters describing various BSM models.",

The |y| distribution in four bins is considered for the tt-enriched event samples with exactly one and at least two b-jets; a single bin is considered for the background-enriched sample with zero b-jets. After the calibration, the background components are scaled to the measured values for the nuisance parameters, and the prediction for tt events in each bin is estimated by folding the measured parton-level parameters through the response matrix. The bottom part of each plot shows the ratio of the data to the predicted value together with combined statistical and systematic uncertainties",
