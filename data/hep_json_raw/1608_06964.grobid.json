Our analysis employs a model in which sterile neutrinos arise as Kaluza-Klein states in large extra dimensions and thus modify the neutrino oscillation probabilities due to mixing between active and sterile neutrino states. Using Fermilab's NuMI beam exposure of 10.56 \u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target, we combine muon neutrino charged current and neutral current",

The ratios of reconstructed energy spectra in the two detectors constrain the size of large extra dimensions to be smaller than 0.45 \u00b5m at 90% C.L. in the limit of a vanishing lightest active neutrino mass. Stronger limits are obtained for non-vanishing masses. Neutrino oscillation has been established through measurements of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator beam neutrinos [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. The underlying mechanism can be described by the unitary PMNS mixing matrix [8], which connects the three weak flavor eigenstates (\u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u03c4 ) with the three mass eigenstates (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 ). This matrix can be parameterized by three mixing angles, \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , and \u03b8 23 , and a CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP . Oscillation probabilities in vacuum depend upon the mixing parameters, neutrino energy, travel distance (baseline), and the squared neutrino mass differences \u2206m 2 ij \u2261 m 2 i \u2212 m 2 j (i, j = 1, 2, 3). Oscillation probabilities in long-baseline experiments can be further modified by matter effects [9]. Current data are well described by the three-flavor model. However, with increasing precision of experiments, one can test for discrepancies that could be accounted for by small modifications to the standard threeflavor model. One such scenario employs large extra dimensions.",

Adopting the Large Extra Dimension (LED) model of [14][15][16][17][18], all the Standard Model (SM) fields, including the three left-handed (active) neutrinos and the Higgs doublet, live on a four-dimensional brane, 3+1 spacetime. Three SM singlet fermion fields, one for each neutrino flavor, live in a higher-dimensional bulk, 3+1+d spacetime, with at least two compactified extra dimensions (d \u2265 2). To simplify matters, one of the extra dimensions can be compactified on a circle with radius R much larger than the size of the other dimensions, effectively making this a five-dimensional problem. The compactness of the extra dimension allows a decomposition of each bulk fermion in Fourier modes. From the couplings to gauge bosons, the zero modes can be identified as the active neutrinos, while the other modes are sterile neutrinos. All these states are collectively referred to as the KK towers. The Yukawa coupling between the bulk fermions and the active neutrinos leads to mixing between the SM and KK neutrinos, which alters the three-flavor oscillation probabilities. Hence, neutrino oscillation measurements can constrain the size of large extra dimensions.",

As stated in [18], there are three prominent features of LED visible in this figure: a displacement of the oscillation minimum with respect to the three-flavor case, a reduction of the integrated survival probability because of active-to-KK oscillation, and the appearance of modulations on the survival probability because of fast os- cillations to the KK states. With increasing energy, the amplitude of the modulations increases while their frequency decreases, making the effects of LED easier to observe away from the oscillation minimum.

            "text": "Constraints on this model based on atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator beam neutrino oscillation experiments are discussed in [17]. The authors derived a bound constraining R to be less than 0.82 \u00b5m at 90% C.L. The sensitivities of CHOOZ, KamLAND, and MINOS for this model were calculated in [18] using a modified version of the GLoBES software [24]. Assuming 7.24\u00d710 20 protonson-target (POT) for MINOS in \u03bd \u00b5 mode, a combined sensitivity of R < 0.75 (0.49) \u00b5m at 90% C.L. was obtained for normal (inverted) mass ordering and vanishing m 0 . The zenith distribution of atmospheric neutrino events collected by IceCube was analyzed in [25], where the authors showed that it is possible to exclude R 0.40 \u00b5m at 95% C.L. The above neutrino limits are about two orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from tabletop gravitational experiments [26]. Astrophysical and cosmological bounds are often much more stringent, but are model-dependent [26]. Collider experiments can set limits on the volume of the extra dimensions [26]. This paper presents an analysis, sensitive to LED, of the MI-NOS data set with a low-energy \u03bd \u00b5 mode exposure of 10.56 \u00d7 10 20 POT and a peak neutrino energy of 3 GeV.",
