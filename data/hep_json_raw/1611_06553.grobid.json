Assuming a standard axial-vector spin-dependent WIMP interaction with 129 Xe and 131 Xe nuclei, the most stringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross sections for WIMPs with masses above 10 GeV/c 2 are set in all dark matter direct detection experiments. The minimum upper limit of 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u221241 cm 2 at 90% confidence level is obtained for a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c 2 . This represents more than a factor of two improvement on the best available limits at this and higher masses. These improved cross-section limits provide more stringent constraints on the effective WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron couplings.",

These range from the dynamics, gravitational lensing, and clustering of galaxies to the necessity of DM to explain the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and the formation of cosmological structures. However, the particle nature of DM still remains elusive. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a class of hypothetical particles predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, are promising candidates for DM. Generic WIMP production and annihilation rates in the early universe would lead to a freeze-out WIMP density which could explain the observed DM relic density (the so-called \"WIMP miracle\" [1]). The detection of WIMP signals is the goal of many past, ongoing and future experiments, including direct detection experiments, indirect detection experiments, and experiments at colliders.",

The first two experiments, PandaX-I and PandaX-II, use xenon as a target to search for WIMPs. The third experiment PandaX-III [2], which is being prepared, will search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 136 Xe. PandaX-I, with a 120-kg xenon target, was completed in 2014. PandaX-II, with a half-ton xenon target, has been running since the end of 2015. Both the PandaX-I and PandaX-II experiments use a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber technique. With this technique, both the prompt scintillation photons (S1) produced in liquid xenon and the delayed electroluminescence photons (S2) produced in gaseous xenon for each physical event can be measured. This leads to powerful background suppression and signal-background discrimination. More detailed descriptions of the PandaX-I and PandaX-II experiments can be found in Refs. [3][4][5][6].",

This data set corresponds to a total exposure of 3.3\u00d710 4 kg-days. No excess of events was observed above the background, and WIMP-nucleon cross-section upper limits were set assuming a spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon interaction. The best upper limit of 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u221246 cm 2 for a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c 2 was obtained. In this paper we consider an axial-vector, spin-dependent (SD) interaction, which is well motivated if WIMPs have spin. An example of this would be the lightest neutralino in the supersymmetric theories, which offers one of the most promising DM explanations. Xenon-based experiments, such as PandaX, XENON and LUX, are sensitive to this interaction because xenon contains a significant fraction of isotopes with non-zero spin. LUX experiment [7], with a total exposure of 1.4\u00d710 4 kg-days, pushed down the SD WIMP-neutron and WIMP-proton cross-section limits to 9.4\u00d710 \u221241 cm 2 and 2.9\u00d710 \u221239 cm 2 , respectively, at a WIMP mass of 33 GeV/c 2 .

This is shown in Fig. 1. For both 129 Xe and 131 Xe, the neutron-only structure factor is much larger than protononly, since the total nuclear spin is dominated by the unpaired neutron. It is worth noting (as in Ref. [11]) that \"neutron/proton-only\" is simply a notation for convenience. When two-body currents are included, neutrons can contribute to the proton-only coupling. This in fact significantly enhances the proton-only while slightly reducing the neutron-only structure factor.   2 shows the calculated recoil-energy distributions without detector effects for two WIMP masses 40 GeV/c 2 and 400 GeV/c 2 , for neutron-only and proton-only cou-plings. Here the WIMP-neutron and WIMP-proton cross sections are assumed to be \u03c3 n = 10 \u221240 cm 2 and \u03c3 p = 3 \u00d7 10 \u221239 cm 2 , respectively. This allows the two cases be to compared directly. The recoil-energy distribution for proton-only coupling is harder than neutron-only, since the proton-only structure factor decreases more slowly at high recoil energies compared to the neutron-only.

            "text": "As in Ref. [6], the data set is divided into 15 time bins to take into account the temporal change of detector parameters and background rates. For each time bin, we simulate S1 and S2 signal distributions from the obtained WIMP nuclear recoil-energy distributions using the NEST model [15]. We apply the same S1 and S2 selections as in Ref. [6], requiring an S1 in the range of 3 photoelectrons (PE) and 45 PE and an S2 in the range of 100 PE (uncorrected) and 10000 PE. Fig. 3 shows the final detection efficiency per WIMP-xenon interaction (weighted average of 15 time bins) as a function of the WIMP mass for the neutron-only and protononly SD interactions. The efficiency for SI interaction is also included for comparison. Here, all measured efficiencies for data quality, S1 and S2 selections, as well as the additional boosted-decision-tree selection for suppressing accidental background have been taken into account. For SD interaction, the efficiency increases from approximately 2% (m = 10 GeV/c 2 ) to approximately 45% at high masses. The difference between proton-only and neutron-only couplings is due to the difference of the recoil-energy distributions (Fig. 2) and the dependence of the efficiency on recoil energy (Fig. 2 in Ref. [6]). The upper limits for the SD WIMP-nucleon cross sections are calculated with the same procedure as in Ref. [6]. Test statistics based on profile likelihood ratio [23,24] were constructed over grids of WIMP mass and cross section. Then, the 90% confidence level (CL) upper limits of cross sections were calculated using the CL s approach [25,26]. The results are shown in Fig. 4, with recent results from other experiments overlaid. The upper limits presented lie within the \u00b11\u03c3 sensitivity band. The lowest cross-section limit obtained is 4.1\u00d710 \u221241 cm 2 (1.2\u00d710 \u221239 cm 2 ) for WIMP-neutron (WIMP-proton) elastic scattering at a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c 2 . For neutron-only coupling, the lowest exclusion limits for WIMP above 10 GeV/c 2 in direct detection experiments are obtained. Under model assumptions, results from DM searches at colliders can also be interpreted as the WIMP-nucleon cross-section limits. For example, mono-jet search results from CMS [16] and ATLAS [18] have been interpreted in the framework of the so-called \"simplified\" DM model [17,27,28] which includes four parameters: the DM mass, the mediator mass, the coupling of the mediator to DM particles (g DM ) and the coupling of the mediator to quarks (g q ). Four coupling scenarios g q = g DM = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.45 have been considered in Ref. [17] for interpreting the CMS results. The ATLAS collaboration reported the limits for the couplings g q = 0.25 and g DM = 1. In Fig. 4 we include the limits obtained from the smallest and the largest couplings from CMS and the limits from ATLAS. These limits are particularly strong for low mass WIMPs, but one should note the strong model dependence. Our SD WIMP-proton cross-section limits are much weaker than the WIMP-neutron ones due to the even number  [7], XENON100 [8], CMS mono-jet [16,17], ATLAS mono-jet [18], PICO-2L [19],PICO-60 [20],IceCube [21] and Super-K [22]. The 1 and 2-\u03c3 sensitivity bands are shown in green and yellow, respectively. of protons and the unpaired neutron in 129 Xe and 131 Xe nuclei. PICO experiments [19,20], on the other hand, utilizing 19 F nuclei that contains unpaired protons, produced so far the most stringent constraints on the SD WIMP-proton cross sections in all direct search experiments. Indirect search experiments, IceCube [21] and Super-K [22], can produce more stringent limits, depending on WIMP masses and annihilation channels.",

For WIMPs with masses above 10 GeV/c 2 , the most stringent upper limits to date on the SD WIMP-neutron cross sections in all direct DM search experiments are set, with a lowest excluded value of 4.1\u00d710 \u221241 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c 2 . This result is complementary to the results obtained from WIMP searches performed at the LHC, which can produce strong limits particularly for low mass WIMPs, depending on the models and assumptions. For high mass WIMPs, the constraints on the effective WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron couplings have also been improved over previous results from direct DM search experiments. These constraints are complementary to experiments (such as PICO), which are more sensitive to WIMP-proton than WIMP-neutron coupling.",
