            "text": "Compact large extra dimensions (ED) are an intriguing proposed solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model (SM), which refers to the puzzling fact that the fundamental scale of gravity M Pl \u223c 10 19 GeV is so much higher than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale \u223c 10 3 GeV. With such a difference in scales, it is difficult to protect the Higgs boson mass from radiative corrections without a very high degree of fine-tuning. The original proposal to use ED to solve the hierarchy problem was presented by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD)  [1,2]. They posited a scenario wherein the SM is constrained to the common 3+1 space-time dimensions, while gravity is free to propagate through the entire multidimensional space. Thus, the gravitational flux in 3+1 dimensions is effectively diluted by virtue of the multidimensional Gauss's Law. The fundamental Planck scale M D is therefore related to the apparent scale M Pl according to the formula",

Decays to fermions are suppressed relative to photons because the graviton is spin-2 and the fermions cannot be produced in the s wave. Because the KK gravitons propagate through the compact extra dimensions, their wavefunction must satisfy periodic boundary conditions, which result in discrete energy levels with modal spacing of the order of the inverse ED size, from 1 meV to 100 MeV. This results in an apparent continuum spectrum of diphotons, rather than distinct resonances.",

The detector consists of an all-silicon tracker, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a hadronic sampling calorimeter (HCAL), all contained inside a large-bore 3.8 T superconducting solenoid. In the central region, the tracker consists of three layers of silicon pixel detectors, followed by 10 layers of single-and double-sided silicon-strip detectors. The calorimeter towers are projective and finely segmented, with \u2206\u03b7 \u2248 \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 0.087 in the central region. Moreover, each tower consists of a five-by-five transverse grid of ECAL crystals (\u2206\u03b7 \u2248 \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 0.0174), allowing precise reconstruction of the e/\u03b3 position and energy. Here, the pseudorapidity \u03b7 is defined as \u2212 ln(tan \u03b8 2 ), where \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the direction of the counterclockwise beam, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. Beyond the solenoid there are four layers of muon detectors, which are interspersed throughout the steel return yoke of the magnet. The instantaneous luminosity is measured with a relative uncertainty of 4% using information from forward hadronic calorimeters [12]. The CMS trigger system consists of two levels. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events for more refined selection and analysis at a rate of up to 80 kHz. The software-based High Level Trigger further decreases the rate to a maximum of \u223c 300 Hz for data storage. Events for the control samples used in this analysis were collected through a single-photon trigger, where the photon was required to have a transverse energy E T \u2261 JHEP05 (2011)085E sin \u03b8 of at least 20 or 30 GeV, depending on the data collection period. Events in the signal sample were also initially collected through a single E T > 20 GeV photon trigger. However, as the instantaneous luminosity increased, we switched to a double-photon trigger requiring both photons to have E T > 22 GeV.",

The invariant mass and photon pseudorapidity selection criteria are optimized to produce the highest sensitivity for values of M S and n ED to which the present data is sensitive. The optimization is performed first with a fixed M \u03b3\u03b3 requirement and a floating |\u03b7| requirement. We then alternate, floating the |\u03b7| requirement and fixing the M \u03b3\u03b3 requirement. This iterative optimization is continued until we converge on a final choice of |\u03b7| < 1.44 and M \u03b3\u03b3 > 500 GeV. The optimal choice for |\u03b7| was very close to the ECAL barrel-endcap boundary, so we chose the edge of the transition region into the boundary for simplicity. This defines the signal region.

The samples corresponding to numerator and denominator are defined such that they are mutually exclusive.

Because the energy of the LHC is significantly higher than the limits on M S we are able to set in this analysis, we take this effect into account by conservatively assuming that the signal cross section is zero for \u221a\u015d > M S . Under these assumptions, the limits on M S decrease by 5% for n ED = 2 (1.80 TeV) and 15% for n ED = 7 (1.31 TeV). A summary of the limits under the assumption of a truncated production cross section is also shown in table 3.",

The measured upper limit of 0.11 pb applies also to the cross section times branching fraction times acceptance of diphoton pairs with M \u03b3\u03b3 > 500 GeV and the following kinematic requirements on each of the two photons: E T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.44.",

We optimize the signal selection to reach maximum sensitivity in a counting experiment in a one-sided mass window by selecting events with centrally produced photons and large diphoton invariant mass. Given the absence of an excess over the SM direct diphoton background, we set lower limits on the cutoff scale M S in the range 1.6-2.3 TeV. While this analysis was being finalized, a phenomenological interpretation of the dijet angular distribution results from the CMS and ATLAS experiments appeared [26] and suggested even stronger limits on M S . However, a dedicated experimental analysis and interpretation of the dijet data in the models with large extra dimensions has yet to be conducted. The results presented in this paper extend the current limits reached at the Tevatron [9,10] in all but the n ED = 2 case.",
