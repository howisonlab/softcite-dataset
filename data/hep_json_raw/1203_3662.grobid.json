Following the observation of CP violation in the B 0 system [3], the focus has turned to testing the unitarity of the theory by over-constraining the sides and angles of this triangle. Most related measurements involve loop or box diagrams, and for which the CKM mechanism is typically assumed when interpreting data [4].

Analyses of [13,14] have yielded the most precise measurements of \u03b3 though a 5\u03c3 observation of CP violation from a single analysis has not been achieved. This work represents the first simultaneous analysis of For this analysis, it is required that one of the three tracks forming the B \u00b1 candidate points at a deposit in the hadron calorimeter, or that the hardware-trigger decision was taken independently of these tracks. A second trigger level, implemented entirely in software, receives 1 MHz of events and retains \u223c 0.3% of them. It searches for a track with large p T and large impact parameter (IP) with respect to the PV. This track is then required to be part of a secondary vertex with a high p T sum, significantly displaced from the PV. The displaced vertex is selected, with \u223c 75% efficiency, by an online decision tree algorithm that uses p T , \u03c7 2 IP , flight distance and vertex quality information of the B \u00b1 candidate. Full event reconstruction occurs offline, and after preselection around 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 events are available for final analysis.",

A instr. quantifies the uncertainty on the production, interaction and detection asymmetries. systematic uncertainty accounts for the imperfect modelling of the relative pion and kaon absorption in the tracking material, though no evidence of large imperfections are seen. The fit is constructed such that the observables of interest are parameters of the fit and all systematic uncertainties discussed above enter the fit as constant numbers in the model. To evaluate the effect of these systematic uncertainties, the fit is rerun many times varying each of the systematic constants by its uncertainty. The resulting spread (RMS) in the value of each observable is taken as the systematic uncertainty on that quantity and is summarised in Table 2. Correlations between the uncertainties are considered negligible so the total systematic uncertainty is just the sum in quadrature. For the ratios of partial widths in the favoured and CP modes, the uncertainties on the PID efficiency and the relative width of the D K \u00b1 and D\u03c0 \u00b1 peaks dominate.

In the top plots, the bachelor track passes the DLL K \u03c0 > 4 cut and the B candidates are reconstructed assigning this track the kaon mass. The remaining events are placed in the sample displayed on the bottom row and are reconstructed with a pion mass hypothesis.

This cut is tight enough that no cross feed occurs from the favoured mode into the CP modes. In contrast, the ADS mode suffers a potentially large cross feed from the favoured mode in the circumstance that both D daughters are misidentified (K \u2194 \u03c0 ). The invariant mass spectrum of such cross feed is broad but peaks around m D 0 PDG . It is reduced by vetoing any ADS candidate whose D candidate mass under the exchange of its daughter track mass hypotheses, lies within \u00b115 MeV/c 2 of m D 0PDG . Importantly for the measurements of R \u00b1h , this veto is also applied to the favoured mode. With the D mass selection and the D daughter PID requirements, this veto reduces the rate of cross feed to an almost negligible rate of (6 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10 \u22125 .",

Some of the most powerful methods for determining \u03b3 are measurements of the partial widths of B \u00b1 \u2192 D K \u00b1 decays where the D signifies a D 0 orD 0 meson. In this case, the amplitude for the B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 contribution is proportional to V cb whilst the B \u2212 \u2192D 0 K \u2212 amplitude depends on V ub . If the D final state is accessible for both D 0 andD 0 mesons, the interference of these two processes gives sensitivity to \u03b3 and may exhibit direct CP violation. This feature of open-charm B \u2212 decays was first recognised in its application to CP eigenstates, such as D \u2192 K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212",

The quantity s/ \u221a s + b serves as an optimisation metric. The BDT response peaks towards 0 for background and 1 for signal. The optimal cut is found to be > 0.92 for the ADS mode; this is also applied to the favoured mode. For the cleaner CP modes, a cut of BDT > 0.80 gives a similar background level but with a 20% higher signal efficiency. PID information is quantified as differences between the logarithm of likelihoods, ln L h , under different particle hypotheses (DLL). Daughter kaons of the D meson are required to have DLL K \u03c0 = ln L K \u2212 ln L \u03c0 > 2 and daughter pion must have DLL K \u03c0 < \u22122. Multiple candidates are arbitrated by choosing the candidate with the best-quality B \u00b1 vertex; only 26 events in the final sample of 157 927 require this consideration. The number of candidates from B decays that do not contain a true D meson can be reduced by requiring the flight distance significance of the D candidate from the B \u2212 vertex to be> 2.
