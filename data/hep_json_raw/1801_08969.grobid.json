            "text": "A revolution in elementary particle physics occurred during the period from the ICHEP1968 to the ICHEP1982 with the advent of the parton model from discoveries in Deeply Inelastic electron-proton Scattering at SLAC, neutrino experiments, hard-scattering observed in p+p collisions at the CERN ISR, the development of QCD, the discovery of the J/\u03a8 at BNL and SLAC and the clear observation of high transverse momentum jets at the CERN SPSp + p collider. These and other discoveries in this period led to the acceptance of QCD as the theory of the strong interactions. The desire to understand nuclear physics at high density such as in neutron stars led to the application of QCD to this problem and to the prediction of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in nuclei at high energy density and temperatures. This eventually led to the construction of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL to observe superdense nuclear matter in the laboratory. This article discusses how experimental methods and results which confirmed QCD at the first hadron collider, the CERN ISR, played an important role in experiments at the first heavy ion collider, RHIC, leading to the discovery of the QGP as a perfect liquid as well as discoveries at RHIC and the LHC which continue to the present day.",

The free partons each have longitudinal momentum a fraction x of the proton longitudinal momentum P where the probability of the parton to have the momentum xP is given by F 2 (x) where x = Q 2 /(2M \u03bd) and M is the mass of the proton. As an experimentalist, I had done muon-proton elastic scattering in the more usual frame where the proton is at rest in a liquid hydrogen target. The proton recoils with kinetic energy \u03bd from an elastic scattering by the \u00b5 (or e) with 4-momentum-transfer 2 Q 2 where \u03bd = Q 2 /(2M ) so that it was easy for me to understand that DIS of an e from a proton is just quasi-elastic scattering from a parton at rest with a fracton x of the mass of the proton which would become a fraction of the momentum in any moving frame.",

Don Perkins in his conclusions [Perkins 1973] from new measurements of neutrino scattering cross sections and nucleon structure functions from the CERN Gargamelle collaboration emphasized: i) that both \u03bd and\u03bd cross sections in the range 2-10 GeV are linear with energy, in accord with Bjorken scaling; . . . iv) In terms of constituent models, the fractional charged (Gell-Mann/Zweig) quark model [Gell-Mann 1964,Zweig 2010] is the only one that fits both the neutrino and electron data ( F \u03bdN 2 (x) dx/ F eN 2 (x) dx = 3.4 \u00b1 0.7 \u2248 18/5); v) The fractional nucleon 4-momentum carried by gluons is 50% and vi) by antiquark constituents is only \u223c 10% of that carried by quarks and antiquarks together. 2. The birth of QCD where Fritzsch and Gell-Mann  proposed that the three distinct colors assigned to the 3 s-quarks in the \u2126 \u2212 (sss) [Gell-Mann 2013] to allow them to be in the same state, avoiding simple Fermi statistics by obeying \"para-Fermi statistics of rank 3\" [Greenberg 1964], could also apply to gluons \"which could form a color-octet of neutral vector fields obeying the Yang-Mills equations\". 3. The discovery of enhanced particle production at large transverse momentum p T in p+p collisions at the CERN-ISR [Cool 1973] with a power-law shape, which depended on the c.m. energy of the collision, \u221a s, quite distinct from the exponential e \u22126p T [Cocconi 1961] spectrum at low p T < 1 GeV/c which depended minimally if at all on \u221a s (Fig. 2a). This was proof that the partons of DIS interacted strongly with each other rather than simply scatter electromagnetically which must occur in a p+p collision since the partons are charged (Fig. 2b) [Berman 1971].",

            "text": "2 Weak Bosons from strong interactions? 1960-1970 The completion of the two highest energy (\u223c 30 GeV) proton accelerators, the PS at CERN (November 1959) and the AGS at BNL (August 1960) opened the possibility of studying weak interactions at high energy rather than only by radioactive decay. The idea of the left-handed parity violating W \u00b1 bosons as the quanta of the weak interactions [Lee and Yang 1960] led to proposals for neutrino beams and experiments at the two laboratories [Pontecorvo 1959] [Schwartz 1960] to measure neutrino scattering and to discover the W which would prevent the otherwise pointlike neutrino interaction cross sections from increasing monotonically with energy until they violated unitarity [Lee 1961]. Although a Nobel Prize winning discovery, the muon neutrino [Danby 1962], was made with the first accelerator neutrino experiment, the W was not observed in the early neutrino experiments. Relatively low limits were set for the mass of the W \u00b1 (> 2 GeV) [Bernardini 1964] [Burns 1965a] because of the low energy neutrino beams with small neutrino cross sections and it was realized that p+p collisions might be more favorable for producing the W , e.g p+p\u2192 d + W + [Bernstein 1963] [Nearing 1963] [Piccioni 1966]. This last reference is interesting for three reasons: 1. There is a comment from A. (Antonino) Zichichi [Zichichi 1966] on studies at CERN to observe the W \u00b1 in p+p collisions, which is so clear that it deserves a verbatim quote:\"We would observe the \u00b5's from W -decays. By measuring the angular and momentum distribution at large angles of K and \u03c0's, we can predict the corresponding \u00b5-spectrum. We then see if the \u00b5's found at large angles agree with or exceed the expected numbers.\" The W \u00b1 would be visible above the background as a Jacobian peak at lepton transverse momentum p \u00b5 T = M W /2.",

Chilton, Saperstein and Shrauner [Chilton 1966] emphasized the need to know the time-like form factor of the proton to calculate the cross section for producing W 's and used the Conserved Vector Current (CVC) theory to estimate the W production cross section by relating it to di-muon production in the reaction p + p \u2192 \u00b5 + + \u00b5 \u2212 +anything.",

These developments led Leon Lederman to propose in August 1967 a more elegant beam dump di-muon experiment at the BNL-AGS (AGS 420) with a thick Uranium target and muon momentum measurement by range in a series of iron and concrete absorbers to search for W bosons, measure the time-like form factor and possibly look for 'massive' vector meson production. I had proposed a di-muon experiment in May 1967 (AGS 412) modifying an existing Harvard photoproduction experiment (AGS 310) so as to search for \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs produced in a Pb target by an incident muon beam-muon tridents. With three muons in the final state, two of them identical, we could test whether muons obeyed Fermi statistics or para-statistics and whether there was a force between muons other than electromagnetic.",

The high p T discovery represented totally new physics, strongly interacting partons, which excited me very much. I resigned from all my Fermilab proposals, and being on the faculty of the Rockefeller University since 1971 I was able to move to Geneva to be with the Rockefeller group there and continue the work of the CERN-Columbia-Rockefeller (CCR) series of experiments which helped lead to the confirmation of QCD as the theory of the strong interactions.",

Resonances were one of the original purposes of the experiment stated in the AGS 420 proposal, and were mentioned in the di-muon publication [Christenson 1970]: \"As seen in both the mass spectrum and the resultant cross section d\u03c3/dm, there is no forcing evidence of any resonant structure\" although \"Indeed in the mass region near 3.5 GeV/c 2 , the observed spectrum may be reproduced by a composite of a resonance and a steeper continuum.\" A proposal was actually made in September 1970 (AGS 549) by some younger members of the Lederman group to follow up the resonance possibility; but it never really got off the ground for various reasons. 1 As noted above the situation was finally cleared up in November 1974; but there were also many exciting developments in high p T physics and QCD from 1971 to 1974.",

More importantly, they also measured \u03c0 0 by conversion of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 decay photons in the ISR vacuum pipe but found no single e \u00b1 with p T > 3 GeV/c so set a limit for single electron production.

The \u03c0 0 were detected in two identical Pb Glass electromagnetic calorimeters preceded by tracking chambers located at 90 \u2022 on both sides of the colliding proton beams. The \u03c0 0 spectrum was measured in the range 2.4 \u2264 p T \u2264 9 GeV/c at 5 c.m. energies \u221a s = 23.5, 30.6, 44.8, 52.7 and 62.4 GeV.

CCRS and the Fermilab experiments all found that the ratio e, \u00b5/\u03c0 \u2248 10 \u22124 . There were no clear ideas about the source of these direct leptons at this time, as well summarized by Lederman at ICHEP1974 [Lederman 1974]. Following these results, many experiments that were not originally designed for these measurements, which are extremely difficult, also attempted to look for direct single leptons. This only added confusion to the situation because they mostly found results that were incorrect. A beautiful summary of all these experiments and their difficulty was again presented by Leon Lederman at the 1975 Lepton Photon Symposium [Lederman 1975] [Lederman 1976] paraphrased succintly as: \u00b5 \u00b1 : Muon detection requires an understanding of the trivial but devastating background of pion and kaon decay. e \u00b1 : Electron detection suffers from problems of conversions of photons (principally from \u03c0 0 decay)in any residual material, from Dalitz pairs, from electron decay of long-lived sources (K, \u039b, \u03a3, ...)",

Production of lepton pairs with large mass is well accounted for by the Drell-Yan process. The origin of direct single leptons is principally due to the production of lepton pairs. A dominant source of lepton pairs is at low effective mass, m < 600 MeV.\" I strenuously disagreed with him for the CCRS result in a comment [Tannenbaum 1977]. Here is why.",

We did this by adding material of a few percent of a radiation length X o in addition to the 0.016 X o thickness of the stainless steel corrugated vacuum pipe ( Fig. 5a) [B\u00fcsser 1976b]. Measurements were made for the accepted single e \u00b1 events and also for selected conversions by requiring double (or more) ionization in the H hodoscope. The data are normalized to the normal running conditions with only the ISR vacuum pipe of 0.016 X o .

Such copious \u03c6 production should be easy to detect via the principal decay mode K + K \u2212 , so we removed the Cerenkov counter from the trigger in 'arm2' and made a short run looking for charged hadron h + + h \u2212 pairs with p T > 1.6 GeV/c. We didn't find any and set a limit \u03c3 \u03c6 =\u2264 0.4\u03c3 \u03c0 0 to 90% confidence which implied that the possible \u03c6 contribution was less than 0.25 to 0.5 the observed single e \u00b1 signal. The result was that the direct single e \u00b1 cross section in the range 1.6 < p T < 4.7 GeV/c at \u221a s = 52.7 GeV is (1.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 that of the \u03c0 \u00b1 cross section ( Fig. 5b) [B\u00fcsser 1974].

However, we did find out the answer two weeks later with the 'November revolution' in particle physics caused by the discovery of a new \"heavy particle J with mass m = 3.1 GeV/c 2 and width approximately zero\" [Aubert 1974] in p+Be collisions at the BNL-AGS ( Fig. 6a) simultaneously with the same particle except called \u03a8 in e + + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons in the storage ring (SPEAR) at SLAC [Augustin 1974].",

Within another 2 weeks, just in time for a \"second narrow resonance\" the \u03a8 with m = 3.7 GeV/c 2 to be discovered at SLAC [Abrams 1974], two proposals for new e + e \u2212 measurements from members of CCRS were submitted to the ISRC. Also in this interval CCRS found the reason why we didn't find anything balancing our single e \u00b1 in the opposite spectrometer: a computer bug in 'arm1' that rejected tracks in the entire H hodoscope rather than just near the spaces between counters. In fact in the CCOR proposal [CCOR 1974] there were 7 e + e \u2212 events shown of which 4 clustered near m ee = 3 GeV/c 2 . The issue of why there were two proposals from CCRS members is also interesting. In May 1973, the CCR part of CCRS had made a proposal [CCOR 1973] 3 for a totally new detector with much larger solid angle than either the original CCR or CCRS experiments, which was approved in March 1974.

Meanwhile the rest of the CERN physicists were not idle and a series of Discussion Meetings was held in the CERN auditorium, the most memorable for me being the one on February 21, 1975: \"The new particles: what are CERN experimentalists doing?\" We in CCRS had the only J/\u03a8 data and I had collected the events we had found up to that time and submitted a plot to the ISR coordinator, Ugo Amaldi, who gave the ISR presentation. I was sitting in the front row. Carlo Rubbia (my boss when I was a CERN post-doc in 1965-66) was seated in the second row, one seat to my left. When Ugo showed the plot (Fig. 6b), Carlo got very excited and pointed at the event at 3.7 GeV/c 2 and asked loudly repeatedly \"What is that event at 3.7, what is that event at 3.7?\" We couldn't really claim that it was the \u03a8 , so I turned to Carlo and said, \"Oh Carlo, you are the expert in one-event experiments.\" It was amazing: laughter filled the auditorium, moving up the rows in a wave until everybody in the audience (except Carlo) was laughing-very memorable! The CCRS result was submitted for publication on 22 April 1975 [B\u00fcsser 1975a]  (Fig. 6c).",

The answer was NO as shown in the final CCRS paper on \"Electrons at the ISR\" (Fig. 7b) [B\u00fcsser 1976b] and also shown for charged hadron decays in Lederman's talk [Lederman 1975]  (Fig. 7a).  Fig. 18. The spectrum of single electrons predicted due to the production and decay of the J(3.1) for four assumed values of {p~). The J(3.l) cross section corresponding to these values of (p~) are given in table 17. Also shown is the charge-averaged invariant cross section for single-electron production at x/s = 52.7 GeV from table 11. The three lowest points come from the e/\u2022r \u00b0 data, and have been renormalized so as to agree with the other data for p~ > 1.3 GeV/c. Limits on the cross section of any particles, produced with similar dynamics to the J(3.1) and which undergo two-body decays to e+e -or e\u00b1v, can be obtained approximately from fig. 18 by sliding the (p~) = 1 GeV/c curve until its peak is at the appropriate transverse momentum and it fits the single-electron data above the peak. The limits thus obtained are given in fig. 19a. Another limit on the productio n of electron pairs with mass Mee >~ 4.0 GeV/c 2 is obtained from the fact that no e+epairs of such high mass were observed in this experiment. This implies a 95% confidence upper limit of l/3 the J(3.1) cross section (table 17) for the integral of all electron pair production from mass Mee of 4.0 to 50.8 GeV/c 2 at c.m.s, energy x/s = 52.7 GeV. Similarly, a limit on lower mass e+e -pairs can be obtained from fig. 11, which showed no evidence for e+e -pair production with p* /> 1.0 GeV/c",

This was made by the Lederman group who suggested that \"the name \u03a5 (Upsilon) be given either to the resonance at 6 GeV if confirmed or to the onset of high-mass dilepton physics.\" This later became known as the oopsLeon when, in a measurement of high mass \u00b5 + + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs which allowed a higher data taking rate made possible by the filtering of most hadrons, the same group [Hom 1976b] observed that \"the dimuon mass spectrum provides no evidence for fine structure above 5 GeV\". The situation was again reversed following a major redesign of the dimuon experiment, when the real \u03a5 \u2192 \u00b5 + + \u00b5 \u2212 , a narrow resonance at 9.5 GeV, was discovered [Herb 1977]  (Fig. 8a). This was a narrow bound state of heavier quarks as predicted [Eichten 1977] and turned out to be the discovery of the bottom quark b, a member of a third family of quarks much heavier than the first two families.",

Of course without the intervening J/\u03a8 charmonium discovery, it is unlikely that charm particles would have been considered. In fact, the first attempt of explaining the CCRS measurements was by Farrar and Frautschi [Farrar 1976] who proposed that the direct-single-e \u00b1 were due to the internal conversion of direct photons with a ratio \u03b3/\u03c0 0 \u223c10-20%. However CCRS was able to cleanly detect (and reject) both external and internal conversions, since there was zero magnetic field on the axis, so was able to set limits excluding this explanation to less than 6.6% of the observed signal [B\u00fcsser 1976b]. The first correct explanation of the CCRS direct-single-e \u00b1 (prompt leptons) was given by Hinchliffe and Llewellyn-Smith [Hinchliffe 1976a] as due to semi-leptonic Fig. 9. Invariant cross sections of (e + + e \u2212 )/2 (points) at mid-rapidity for 5 values of \u221a s in p+p collisions at the CERN-ISR [B\u00fcsser 1976b].

The \u03c0 0 data were obtained from the measured spectra of selected conversions and the \u03c0 \u00b1 from the British-Scandinavan data [Alper 1975a] (solid points).

The important issue from a historical perspective is that many experiments not designed for the purpose wanted to get into the prompt-lepton act, which resulted in questionable (i.e. incorrect) results, and this is only one example. See PT ~ 0 (e.g. at ISR energies with D(1.8) -~ Key we get (e)px<O.4/(zr)pT<O. 4 ~ 0.7 X 10 -4 at 90 \u00b0, x = 0). However, our calculated (e)/6r) falls much faster with x than any of the data e.g. it is an order of magnitude below the 300 GeV data at x = 0.3 and a factor of fifty too small at x = 0.5, a result Which is not very sensitive to M D or to the decay spectrum since p and co dominate. The reason for this difficulty at large x e is that Xparent = Ax e with, typically, A ~ 1.15 for two body decays and A ~ 2 for D -+ Key. Combined with the rapid change o f y as a function o f p T at fixed x for the pion (which is the origin of the \"seagull effect\" of ~pT ) increasing with x, assuming factorization in y and PT) this has a dramatic effect on e/n since 2 2",

This is nicely illustrated by the \u03c0 0 measurements from another 'second generation' ISR experiment [Kourkoumelis 1979a] based on liquid-argon-Pb plate calorimeters of high spatial resolution and large solid angle acceptance ( Fig. 13c).

A second calculation by Owens [Owens 1978b] which included the k T effect also fit the CCRS [B\u00fcsser 1976a] data down to p T = 3 GeV/c. These calculations all assume that high p T particles are produced from states with two roughly back-to-back jets which are the result of scattering of a parton from each nucleon. The calculations require the purely theoretical elementary QCD subprocesses plus other quantities which must come from measurements. It is also important to understand the kinematics of parton-parton scattering and the definition of the various kinematic quantites. These are given in the Appendix (section 14).",

A naive experimentalist would think of Q 2 = \u2212t for a scattering subprocess and Q 2 =\u015d for a Compton or annihilation subprocess. Equation 18 gives the p T spectrum of outgoing parton c, which then fragments into a jet of hadrons, including e.g. \u03c0 0 . To go to the particle level the fragmentation function D \u03c0 0 c (z) which is the probability for a \u03c0 0 to carry a fraction z = p \u03c0 0 /p c of the momentum of outgoing parton c must be multiplied in along with its differential dz. Equation 18 must be summed over all subprocesses leading to a \u03c0 0 in the final state weighted by their respective fragmentation functions. In this formulation, f A a (x 1 ), f B b (x 2 ) and D \u03c0 0 c (z) represent the \"long-distance phenomena\" to be determined by experiment; while the characteristic subprocess angular distributions, \u03a3 ab (cos \u03b8 * ) ( Fig. 15) and the coupling constant, \u03b1 s (Q 2 ) = 12\u03c0 25 ln(Q 2 /\u039b 2 ) , are fundamental predictions of QCD [Combridge 1977] [Cutler 1978] for the short-distance, large-Q 2 , phenomena. When higher order effects are taken into account, it is necessary to specify factorization scales \u00b5 for the distribution and fragmentation functions in addition to renormalization scale \u039b which governs the running of \u03b1 s (Q 2 ). As noted above, the momentum scale Q 2 \u2248 p 2 T for the scattering subprocess, while Q 2 \u2248\u015d for a Compton or annihilation subprocess, but the exact meanings of Q 2 and \u00b5 2 tend to be treated as parameters rather than as dynamical quantities.",

The first correct results from an experiment specifically designed to detect real single photons at the ISR [Amaldi 1979] set a 95% confidence upper limit of \u03b3/\u03c0 0 < 4% for 2.3 \u2264 p T \u2264 3.4 GeV/c. The first experiment to actually correctly claim the observation of a signal for direct-\u03b3/\u03c0 0 \u2248 0.2 for p T \u2265 4.5 GeV/c and generally given credit for the discovery of direct-\u03b3 production was the measurement by the AABC experiment [Diakonou 1979] a modification of the ABCS experiment using the high resolution calorimeters which could resolve the two \u03b3's from \u03c0 0 decay. The first measurement of the direct-\u03b3 cross section was by CCOR [Angelis 1980a] who could not resolve the two \u03b3s in a cluster but instead measured the fraction of clusters of a given p T that would pass through the 1.0 radiation length thin-wall of the superconducting solenoid without making a conversion(47% for a single \u03b3 and \u2248 20\u221224% for 2 or more \u03b3 rays in the cluster). This led to a large systematic uncertainty which was not too bad for 9 \u2264 p T \u2264 13 GeV/c (Fig 17a). The cross-sections in this region were in surprisingly good agreement with the final AABC (R806) results (Fig 17b)  [Anassontzis 1982] as discussed in detail by [Ferbel 1984]. The final ISR direct-\u03b3 measurement [Angelis 1989] also includes a summary of the previous measurements, which are all in impressive agreement over the range 4 \u2264 p T \u2264 13 GeV/c as shown in  7.2.1 Theoretical predictions of direct-\u03b3 data show that QCD really works.",

From the experimental point of view, a better illustration of QCD in action is given by the x T scaling of all the existing direct-\u03b3 measurements (Fig. 19). For x T scaling with n eff =4.0 (the parton model) QCD non-scaling is visible; but x T scaling with n eff =4.5 accounts for the non-scaling evolution which is a key element of QCD .",

In this case, the jets should be coplanar with the beam direction and balance transverse momenta. Viewed down the beam axis, in azimuthal projection (Fig. 20), the events should show strong azimuthal correlation. Another possibility was balance as required by kinematics [Di Lella 1974]. a Fig. 20.

Bjorken made a very important point in his parton scattering prediction, that the single high p T particle used as a trigger to search for the opposite jet, would carry \"a major fraction (60-80%) of the total trigger parton (or jet) momentum. This is known as \"trigger bias\" [Jacob 1976] and is related to the Bjorken parent-child relation [Jacob 1978].",

It was generally assumed that the p T a distribution of away side hadron fragments from an away-side parton opposite a single particle trigger with p T t , would be the same as that from a jet-trigger and follow the same fragmentation function of partons as observed in e + e \u2212 or DIS [Darriulat 1976b]  (Fig. 22). Because of the relatively large trigger bias at ISR energies and small range of z trig , 0.8 < \u223c z trig < \u223c 0.9, it was also assumed that x E scaling [Jacob 1976] would hold, i.e. all x E distributions measured at different p T t would be the same. The resulting distribution is shown in fig. 14a, for positive and negative particles together. The average p r o varies from 3.3 GeV/c to 2.3 GeV/c across the x e range. The distribution is steeply falling with x e and has an integral of 0.25 for x e ~> 0.4.

We evaluate the ratio R between the densities of positively and negatively charged jet fragments in a given PT range. This evaluation is performed directly on the raw data, since the detector acceptance is known to be charge-independent. The dependence of R on x \u00b0 is shown in fig. 13 for trigger jets. For away-side jets, to reduce the dependence of the evaluation of x i on acceptance, we refer it to the transverse momentum of the trigger jet, and discard jets having less than 3 GeV/c visible transverse momentum. The result is compared in fig. 14 with data of the Chicago-Princeton Collaboration [30] on inclusive pions. For both trigger jets and opposite-side jets, R increases with the momentum fraction in a way similar to that for inclusive pion production.",

CCHK also looked at the p out variable and plotted p out versus x E for triggers in the range 2.0 \u2264 p Tt \u2264 3.2 GeV/c. They found that the p out increased with increasing x E up to a maximum value of p out \u223c 0.65 GeV/c (Fig. 24b). The original parton model did not assign transverse motion to quarks in the proton, only longitudinal x, but it had been proposed by Levin and Ryskin [Levin 1975] that quarks in the proton also carry transverse momentum. This idea, coupled with the lack of x E scaling for p Tt < 3 GeV/c, was taken by CCHK [Della Negra 1977] as evidence for the transverse momentum of quarks inside the proton. Calculations from their parton scattering model with k T = 0 and k T = 610 MeV/c are shown in Fig. 24b. This result led Feynman, Field and Fox (FFF) [Feynman 1977] to formally introduce \u2212 \u2192 k T , the transverse momentum of a parton in a nucleon into their model of parton-parton scattering.

They could trigger on identified charged particles with detection of the associated charged particles in the Split Field Magnet. The acceptance for associated charged particles, which was the same as CCHK, covered a rapidity range \u22124 \u2264 y \u2264 +4, with an azimuthal aperture of \u00b140 \u2022 on the trigger side and \u00b125 \u2022 on the away side.

This illustrates the di-jet coplanar structure of high p Tt triggered events. One can also see a smaller same side correlation extending out to |y| 2.",

It was debugged, tuned-up and started taking data in July 1977.

In all cases, strong correlation peaks on flat backgrounds are clearly visible, indicating the di-jet structure which is contained in an interval \u2206\u03c6 = \u00b160 \u2022 about a direction towards and opposite the to trigger for all values of associated p T (> 0.3 GeV/c) shown. The width of the peaks about the trigger direction (Fig. 26a), or opposite to the trigger (Fig. 26b) indicates out-of-plane activity from the individual fragments of jets. If the width of the away distributions (Fig. 26b) corresponding to the out of plane activity were due entirely to jet fragmentation, then | sin(\u2206\u03c6)| = |j T \u03c6 |/p T would decrease in direct proportion to 1/p T , since j T \u03c6 , the component of the jet fragmentation transverse momentum, \u2212 \u2192 j T , in the azimuthal plane, should be independent of p T . These data were also further analyzed to measure \u2212 \u2192 j T as well as \u2212 \u2192 k T , the transverse momentum of a parton in a nucleon, as originally shown by the CCHK collaboration [Della Negra 1977], and elaborated by Feynman, Field and Fox (FFF)  [Feynman 1977].",

This figure also showed that there were no di-jets, each of a single particle, as claimed by another ISR experiment of that period [Kourkoumelis 1979b], and by Jacob and Landshoff [Jacob 1976], since there is no peak at x E = 1. There is a small anecdote concerning this measurement and Maurice Jacob's talk at the EPS1979 HEP Conference [Jacob 1979]. Maurice was originally only going to show a plot from the ABCS experiment [Kourkoumelis 1979b] which appeared to show \"a systematic wiggle departure from an exponential...The wiggle could bear witness to a specific process where the two jets would each only consist of one high p T \u03c0 0 \" as he had predicted [Jacob 1976]. I insisted that Maurice also show Fig. 26c, a plot that I had made with three higher p T points than the CCOR plot in Ref. [Angelis 1979a], \"which challenged the one high p T \u03c0 0 only jet idea\" after I nearly broke the telephone in the ISR counting room when I heard that Maurice was only going to show the plot with the \"wiggle\" [Kourkoumelis 1979b].",

CCOR [Angelis 1980b] used a fit to this formula ( Fig. 28a) to derive |k T \u03c6 | and |j T \u03c6 | as a function of p T t and \u221a s (Fig. 28b) from the data of Fig. 26b. This important result showed that |j T \u03c6 | is constant, independent of p Tt and \u221a s, as expected for fragmentation, but that |k T \u03c6 | varies with both p Tt and \u221a s, suggestive of a radiative, rather than an intrinsic origin for k T . Large values of k 2 T \u2248 1 GeV/c were also reported in other CERN-ISR measurements [Clark 1979], [Kourkoumelis 1979c] but it took the e + e \u2212 people several more years to get j T correct [Althoff 1984] because they hadn't understood the \"seagull effect\" [Satz 1976]: with increased momentum of fragments in a jet, their momentum transverse to the jet axis also increases until it reaches its true j T .",

            "text": "The jet searches like many other new measurements, but perhaps the worst in this regard, started off with a major incorrect claim of the observation of the jets of hard scattering at Fermilab. Several fixed target experiments searched for jets using the energy detected in calorimeters with limited aperture (\u2206\u03c6 = \u00b145 \u2022 , \u2206y \u2248 \u00b10.35 to 0.55) at mid-rapidity in the p+p c.m. system. The first claim for discovering the jets from the \"quark-quark scattering model\" was by Fermilab E260 [Bromberg 1978] who found that for \u221a s = 19.4 GeV the cross section for the jet, which was defined by summing all the energy in their calorimeter, was \"similar in shape to the single particle cross section but two orders of magnitude larger.'\" As calorimeters in experiments got larger, the \"jet\" to single particle ratio kept getting larger until the jet fiasco ended dramatically when the NA5 fixed target experiment at CERN, with a hadron calorimeter which covered the full azimuth with a c.m. polar angular interval 54 \u2022 < \u03b8 * < 135 \u2022 (\u2206y \u2248 \u00b10.9) in the p+p c.m. system at \u221a s = 23.8 GeV, presented their results [Pretzl 1980]. The coup de grace was their conclusion:\"The events selected by the full calorimeter trigger show no dominant jet structure. They appear to originate from processes other than two constituent scattering.\" The actual publication of the NA5 result [De Marzo 1982] was perhaps even clearer:\"The large transverse energy observed in the calorimeter is the result of a large number of particles with a rather small transverse momentum\". The problem with the mistaken claim of 'jets' was that the difference between single particle and multiparticle measurements was not understood. The principal multiparticle variables are the charge multiplicity distribution dN ch /d\u03b7 and the transverse energy (E T ) distribution [Landshoff and Polkinghorne 1978] :",

The NA5 result [De Marzo 1982] was the first E T measurement in the form that is still in use at present [Tannenbaum 1989] [Adler 2014]. The difference between single and multi-particle distributions is shown in Fig. 29. Single particle p T distributions (left) follow the e \u22126p T [Cocconi 1961] soft physics particle spectrum until p T \u2248 1 \u2212 2 GeV/c where the hard-scattering power law begins to dominate, roughly 2-3 orders of magnitude down in cross section. On the other hand, the spectrum of the neutral transverse energy E 0 T at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV (right) falls exponentially for \u2265 6 orders of magnitude until the hard scattering component of the E 0 T distribution becomes evident by the break from the exponential spectrum. In the exponential region there was a uniform azimuthal disribution of E 0 T , with a dominant 2 jet structure for E 0 T > 24 GeV [Angelis 1983]. A much clearer separation between \"soft\" and \"hard\" physics in such spectra was determined at the ISR by the AFS collaboration [Akesson 1983] with a full azimuth EM and hadron calorimeter covering the rapidity range |y| < 0.9. A study of the event shape as a function of E T , was performed using a principal axis analysis. A quantity, \"circularity\", was defined which would be 1 for a totally uniform azimuthal distribution of the components of E T and zero if all the E T were in two narrow jets back to back in azimuth. The distributions (Fig.30) show no evidence of jets for E T < 25 GeV at any c.m. energy. However for E T > 25 GeV, there is an increase in low circularity events, leading up to a dominance of low-circularity events from a two-jet structure for E T \u2265 31 GeV at \u221a s = 63 GeV. These beautiful measurements from the year 1983 made it clear that the jets of hard scattering could indeed be observed using E T distributions; but that hard scattering effects have negligible influence on the shape of E T spectra in proton-(anti)proton collisions for the first 4, or even 6, orders of magnitude of cross section, depending on the c.m. energy. However the first convincing evidence of jets and the validity of QCD as the mechanism for hard-scattering came at the ICHEP1982 conference in Paris.",

S. during the period from the ICHEP1980 to the ICHEP1982. There was no clear understanding of why the jets of QCD were not observed in the full azimuth calorimeter which led to doubts by many of the utility and validity of QCD tests in hadron-hadron collisions. To get an idea of the thinking during this period, I had to give a seminar at my laboratory, BNL, in March 1982 with the title:\"Why I believe in jets in spite of calorimeter experiments. For QCD tests try to minimize the effect of jets.\"",

I described my work in this period in a previous EPJH article [Tannenbaum 2016], so I'll skip to March 1982 when I transferred to the BNL Physics Department and resumed work on the CCOR experiment. One of the problems with the CCOR full azimuth superconducting solenoid detector was that it did not have any specific electron identification device like the Cherenkov counters in CCRS, so that in trying to measure e + e \u2212 pairs we had to trigger on clusters with energy > 2.5 GeV in each arm of our EMcalorimeters (as described in Section 4.3.1). This left us with \u2248 750, 000 \u03c0 0 pairs which we decided to analyze in the same way we would analyze e + e \u2212 pairs in the detector, namely the invariant mass M \u03c0\u03c0 of the pair, its net P t and rapidity Y and cos \u03b8 * in the c.m. system of the pair. There were enough events so that we could select \u03c0 0 pairs with net P t < 1 GeV/c (or P t < 2 GeV/c for M \u03c0\u03c0 > 11 GeV/c 2 ) and |Y | < 0.35. Then we moved to the c.m. system of the pair, in which the two \u03c0 0 are back to back at an angle cos \u03b8 * , by the simple rapidity shift y * = y \u2212 Y (Sec. 14.1) for each \u03c0 0 . We knew from FFF [Feynman 1977] that the trigger \u03c0 0 had almost the same p T t as the partonp T t z trig \u2248 1.0. Thanks to the full azimuth charged particle tracking we were able to measure z trig from our own data by summing over all charged particles within an azimuthal angle \u00b160 \u2022 of the trigger in the rapidity range |y| < 0.7, multiplying by 1.5 to account for the missing neutrals [Angelis 1982a]. We noted that the large measured values of z trig > 0.9 for M \u03c0\u03c0 > 8 GeV/c 2 and measured value of |j T y | = 0.44 GeV/c justify the assumption that the axis of the di-pion system in the pair c.m. system follows closely that of the original parton-parton scattering with \u221a\u015d \u2248 M \u03c0\u03c0 . These measured cos \u03b8 * distributions are shown in Fig. 31 and should be able to be compared directly to the cos \u03b8 * distributions of the elementary QCD subprocesses in terms of d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 * at fixed\u015d, Eq. 33, easily derived from Eq. 16:",

In fact the measured distributions for the various M \u03c0\u03c0 \u2248\u015d all have the same shape which we compared directly to the QCD angular distributions from Eq. 33 for the subprocesses, gg, qg, qq and qq elastic scattering [Tannenbaum 1982] also shown in Fig. 31. The measured distributions are steeper than all the QCD constituent scattering subprocess distributions with constant \u03b1 s (Q 2 ). However once the increase of the QCD coupling constant \u03b1 s (Q 2 ), with decreasing Q 2 = \u2212t as cos \u03b8 * increases, is taken into account as shown as the dashed curve for qq with \u03b1 s (Q 2 ), the measurement and QCD predictions agree very well. We had this data for two years until Dave Levinthal and Steve Pordes realized that we had to include the QCD \u03b1 s (Q 2 ) evolution. ",

I was lucky enough to present this result [Tannenbaum 1982] at the ICHEP82 meeting in Paris after the session where UA2 [Repellin 1982] revealed their di-jet LEGO plot measured in a highly segmented total absorption calorimeter covering the azimuthal range \u2206\u03c6 = 300 \u2022 with |y| < 1.0. This now famous plot (Fig. 32) clearly indicated di-jets in collisions at \u221a s = 540 GeV, one of the first results at the CERN SppSp+p collider, which immediately convinced everybody that jets existed. These two measurements and G\u00fcnter Wolf's outstanding rapporteur talk, in which he also verified the cos \u03b8 * calculation with his own overlay plot (lowest right plot in Fig. 31), convinced all observers, and as the news spread, everybody else, that QCD and jets were the cornerstone of the Standard Model. Quotes from G\u00fcnter's proceedings [Wolf 1982] are worth repeating:\"Amongst the most exciting results are the direct measurement of the parton-parton scattering angular distribution and the observation of very energetic jets at the SPS collider.\" \"QCD provides a consistent description for the underlying constituent scattering processes.\" Since that time QCD and jets have become the standard tools of high energy particle physics.",

The events are weighted according to the category in which they fall. A weight proportional to S/(S + B) is used, as suggested in Ref. [121], where S and B are the number of signal and background events, respectively, calculated from the simultaneous signal-plus-background fit to all categories (with varying overall signal strength) and integrating over a 2\u03c3 eff wide window, in each category, centred on 125 GeV. Fig. 3 shows the data, the signal model, and the background model, all weighted. The weights are normalised such that the integral of the weighted signal model matches the number of signal events given by the best fit. The unweighted distribution, using the same binning but in a more restricted mass range, is shown as an inset. The excess at 125 GeV is evident in both the weighted and unweighted distributions.",

Early detailed studies outlined the promise of this mode over a wide range of Higgs boson masses [122]. Only the search in the range 110-160 GeV is reported here. Since there are differences in the reducible background rates and mass resolutions between the subchannels 4e, 4\u00b5, and 2e2\u00b5, they are analysed separately. The background sources include an irreducible four-lepton contribution from direct ZZ production via qq and gluon-gluon processes. Reducible contributions arise from Z + bb and tt production where the final states contain two isolated leptons and two arises from Z + jets and WZ + jets events where jets are misidentified as leptons. Compared to the analysis reported in Ref. [25], the present analysis employs improved muon reconstruction, improved lepton identification and isolation, and a kinematic discriminant exploiting the decay kinematics expected for the signal events. An algorithm to recover final-state radiation (FSR) photons has also been deployed.",

This is different from earlier models which take hadrons as the basic entities [Hagedorn 1994]. Collins and Perry [Collins and Perry 1975] called this state \"quark soup\" but used the equation of state of a gas of free massless quarks from which the interacting gluons acquire an effective mass which provides long-range screening. They also pointed out that for the theory of strong interactions (QCD), \"high density matter is the second situation where one expects to be able to make reliable calculations-the first is Bjorken scaling\". In the Bjorken scaling region, the theory is asymptotically free at large momentum transfers while in high-density nuclear matter long range interactions are screened by many-body effects, so they can be ignored and short distance behavior can be calculated with the asymptotically-free QCD and relativistic many-body theory. Shuryak [Shuryak 1980] codified and elaborated on these ideas and provided the name \"QCD (or quark-gluon) plasma\" QGP for \"this phase of matter\", a plasma being an ionized gas.",

In Ref. [Tannenbaum 2016], I discussed several lucky breaks that I had in being able to attend the ICHEP82 and then to present the lecture with the results shown in Fig. 31. Well, it turned out that I had another important lucky break in August 1983 just after RHIC became a gleam in the eye of NSAC. The chair of the BNL physics department, Arthur Schwartzschild, a Nuclear Physicist, offered me five BNL Nuclear Physicists to participate in the set-up and data taking of an \u03b1 + \u03b1 run which had been scheduled for 16-30 August 1983 at the CERN ISR, as well as to help analyze the data.

The proposal was approved which led to runs with \u03b1 + \u03b1 at because of uncertainty of a change in the absolute p T scale for the EM calorimeter by \u2248 5%, a huge effect when trying to measure a cross section that drops like 1/p n T with n \u2248 10. The \u221a s = 62.4 GeV p+p data were used for comparison, but extrapolated to \u221a s = 31.2 GeV by a method that I kept saying was wrong whenever I was able to communicate with my collaborators adequately (no internet!!!) because I was still making magnets at BNL \u2248 6000 km away.

However an 'anomalous nuclear enhancement' was found in p+A collisions by Jim Cronin and collaborators at Fermilab [Antreasyan, Cronin 1979]. The pion cross section ratio increased as A \u03b1(p T ) where \u03b1(p T ) peaked at \u223c 1.15 for p T = 4\u22125 GeV/c for 19.4 \u2264 \u221a s N N \u2264 27.4 GeV.

We also had a preliminary result which Sanki Tanaka [Angelis, Tanaka 1984] was able to complete in time to present at the Quark Matter 1983 conference, the last week in September 1983, which had been moved from Helsinki to BNL. This result showed that the ratio of the cross sections for \u03b1\u03b1/pp as a function of E T varied by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude, so that the A \u03b1(p T ) Cronin formalism was completely inadequate. We soon understood that this was because E T was a multiparticle distribution [Tannenbaum 1985] which turned out to be very useful in Relativistic Heavy Ion collisions. Based on these ISR \u03b1 + \u03b1 results, I joined with Chellis Chasman, Ole Hansen, Andy Sunyar of BNL, Lee Grodzins of MIT 6 , Shoji Nagamiya of Columbia and others in an experiment (E802) to explore all aspects of relativistic heavy ion collisions at the new heavy ion beam at the BNL-AGS built to prepare for RHIC. -1991-2000 The initial proposal by BNL to the U. ]. The first call for Letters of Intent for experiments was in April 1990 which were evaluated in November 1990 with updated LOI submitted in July 1991. The first Program Advisory Committee (PAC) to evaluate these updated LOI's approved the STAR proposal to join with a BNL TPC proposal to build a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC) concentrating on hadrons. Three other proposals: di-muon, OASIS and TALES/SPARHC were rejected but told by the Associate Lab Director Mel Schwartz to merge into an experiment (most like TALES/SPARHC, my affiliation) to study electrons and photons emerging from the QGP , which became the PHENIX experiment. Two smaller experiments were also approved [Harrison 2003].

This gave PHENIX the possibility of measuring single e \u00b1 for p T > 0.3 GeV/c which was crucial for J/\u03a8 and charm measurements. Measurements of identified hadrons (including charm), although not part of Mel Schwartz's directive, were obviously necessary for understanding the background from their decay. Also, it was always my intention to use single e \u00b1 to measure charm [Tannenbaum 1996], because there is no combinatoric background. This is a serious problem in A+A collisions where charged multiplicities rise to \u2248 A times that in p+p for the most central collisions where the two nuclei fully overlap [Adler 2005]  (Fig. 37). Npart is the number of nucleons struck in the collision. The curve with the ordinate labeled d\u03c3/dn ch represents the relative probability of charged particle multiplicity n ch .

            "text": "12.4 How to find the QGP 1986QGP -2000 At the time of the proposals for experiments at RHIC (also for the LHC [Aamodt 2008]) in 1990-91, there were two proposed signatures of the QGP: strangeness enhancement [Koch, M\u00fcller and Rafelski 1986] and the \"gold-plated\"signature for deconfinement in the QGP, J/\u03a8 suppression [Matsui and Satz 1986]. Matsui and Satz predicted that J/\u03a8 production in A+A collisions will be suppressed by Debye screening of the quark color charge in the QGP. The J/\u03a8 is produced when two gluons interact to produce a cc pair which then resonates to form the J/\u03a8 . In the QGP, the cc interaction is screened so that the cc go their separate ways and eventually pick up other quarks at the periphery to become open charm. However, as pointed out a year later [Matsui 1987], enhanced production of c andc quarks in A+A collisions, so that many of the \"other quarks\" picked up are c orc, could lead to recombination of cc into J/\u03a8 which might \"hinder\" J/\u03a8 suppression as evidence for the QGP. Another problem was that the J/\u03a8 is suppressed in p+A collisions [Prino 2001]. These issues were worked out in further detail by analysis of J/\u03a8 measurements at the CERN fixed-target heavy ion program [Braun-Munzinger and Stachel 2000] with the prediction of enhancement of J/\u03a8 at LHC energies.",

This leads to a reduction of the p T of both the outgoing partons and their fragments, hence a reduction in the number of partons or fragments at a given p T , which is called jet quenching. The effect is absent in p+A or d+A collidons beause no medium is produced (Fig. 38a Transport coefficientq as a function of energy density for different media [Baier 2003]: cold nuclear matter (filled square), massless hot pion gas (dotted) and 'ideal' QGP (solid curve).",

Initially this result was a surprise because heavy flavor quarks were predicted to lose less energy than light quarks due to the \"dead cone effect\" which happens in QED bremsstrahlung [Dokshitzer and Kharzeev 2001]. Figure 41d shows the anisotropic eliptical flow measurement v HF 2 for the heavy flavor quarks and for \u03c0 0 [Adare 2007a].

The v HF 2 in this region suggested [Moore and Teaney 2005] that the charm quarks thermalize in the medium which responds as a thermalized fluid with a small trans- GeV, Fig. 39), where T is the temperature and s is the entropy density. Obviously this is a thermodynamic/hydrodynamic problem with some QCD in the Monte Carlo to get R AA but the results, shown as the dashes for two different values of D = 3/(2\u03c0T ) and D = 12/(2\u03c0T ) on Fig. 41c,d, lead to a spectacular conclusion. Taking D = 6\u03b7/T s \u2248 (6 to 4)/(2\u03c0T) as the most reasonable range that fits both R AA and v HF 2 in Fig. 41c,d [ van Hees, Greco and Rapp 2006], gives the result:",

This is why we claimed the discovery of the QGP, the perfect liquid, at RHIC [Lee 2005], [Arsene 2005], [Back 2005], [Adams 2005], [Adcox 2005]. Miraculously this made the observed R AA equal at SpS and RHIC c.m. energies. I called this my \"Nightmare Scenario\" because I thought that nobody would believe it. The good news was that such models are testable because they predicted the reduction of J/\u03a8 suppression or even an enhancement (R AA > 1) at LHC energies [Braun-Munzinger and Stachel 2000], [Thews, Schroedter and Rafelski 2001], decay. [Andronic, Braun-Munzinger, Redlich and Stachel 2007], which would be spectacular, if observed. As shown in Fig. 42b, the most recent ALICE [Abelev 2014] measurement of R AA for J/\u03c8 at \u221a s N N = 2.76 TeV exhibits considerably less suppression for both J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 at mid rapidity and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 at forward rapadity than the PHENIX measurements at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV in Fig. 42a. The reduction of J/\u03a8 suppression at the LHC compared to RHIC is a clear observation of regeneration at LHC which directly proves the existence of the QGP, since it is evidence that the large number of c andc quarks produced (with their color charge hidden by Debye screening) freely traversed the medium (with a large density of similarly screened color charges) until they met another quark close enough within the screening radii to form J/\u03a8 's. However [Satz 2013], these beautiful results do not prove that J/\u03a8 are deconfined in the QGP. According to Satz, the crucial issue is whether the medium modifies the fraction of produced cc pairs which form J/\u03a8 . Dissociation of J/\u03a8 in the medium would reduce the observed J/\u03a8/cc ratio in A+A compared to p+p collisions, i.e R J/\u03a8 AA /R cc AA 1. Personally, I think that Debye screening which is the basis of suppression of J/\u03a8 in the QGP is proved by Fig. 42  The data provide information on the evolution of the dijet imbalance as a function of both collision centrality (i.e., the degree of overlap of the two colliding nuclei) and the energy of the leading jet. By correlating the dijets detected in the calorimeters with charged hadrons reconstructed in the high-resolution tracking system, the modification of the jet fragmentation pattern can be studied in detail, thus providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of the jet quenching phenomenon.",

The calorimeters provide hermetic coverage over a large range of pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 5.2, where \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)] and \u03b8 is the polar angle relative to the particle beam. In this study, jets are identified primarily using the energy deposited in the leadtungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and the brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) covering |\u03b7| < 3. In addition, a steel and quartz-fiber Cherenkov calorimeter, called hadron forward (HF), covers the forward rapidities 3 < |\u03b7| < 5.2 and is used to determine the centrality of the PbPb collision. Calorimeter cells are grouped in projective towers of granularity in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle given by \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03d5 = 0.087 \u00d7 0.087 at central rapidities, having a coarser segmentation approximately twice as large at forward rapidities. The central calorimeters are embedded in a solenoid with 3.8 T central magnetic field. The event display shown in Fig. 1 illustrates the projective calorimeter tower granularity over the full pseudorapidity range. The CMS tracking system, located inside the calorimeter, consists of pixel and silicon-strip layers covering |\u03b7| < 2.5, and provides track reconstruction down to p T \u2248 100 MeV/c, with a track momentum resolution of \u223c1% at p T = 100 GeV/c. A set of scintillator tiles, the beam scintillator counters (BSC), are mounted on the inner side of the HF calorimeters for triggering and beam-halo rejection. CMS uses a right-handed coordinate system, with the origin located at the nominal collision point at the center of the detector, the x axis pointing toward the center of the LHC ring, the y axis pointing up (perpendicular to the LHC plane), and the z axis along the counterclockwise beam direction. The detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the CMS detector response is based on GEANT4 [30].",
