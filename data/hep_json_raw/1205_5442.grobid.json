For low-mass leptons, there is effectively one FF for B \u2192 D\u2113 \u2212 \u03bd \u2113 , whereas there are three FFs for B \u2192 D * \u2113 \u2212 \u03bd \u2113 decays, all of which have been measured with good precision [23]. For heavy leptons, each of these decays depends on an additional FF which can be calculated using heavy quark symmetry relations or lattice QCD. We use the calculations in Ref. [7] for B \u2192 D\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 , and in Ref. [8] for B \u2192 D * \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 . For the D * * (\u2113/\u03c4 )\u03bd background, we consider in the nominal fit only the four L = 1 states that have been measured [24]. We simulate these decays using the LLSW calculation [25].",

Each BDT selector relies on the simulated distributions of the following variables: (1) E extra ; (2) \u2206E; (3) the reconstructed mass of the signal D meson; (4) the mass difference for the reconstructed signal D * : \u2206m = m(D\u03c0) \u2212 m(D); (5) the reconstructed mass of the seed meson of the B tag ; (6) the mass difference for a D * originating from the B tag , \u2206m tag = m(D tag \u03c0) \u2212 m(D tag ); (7) the charged particle multiplicity of the B tag candidate; and (8) cos \u2206\u03b8 thrust .
