The results are based on a CMS search in final states with three isolated leptons (e or \u00b5) or two isolated leptons with the same electric charge. Exotic heavy quark pair production through the strong interaction is considered. In the context of vector-like quark models, T quarks with a mass mT < 480 GeV and mT < 550 GeV are excluded for weak isospin singlets and doublets, respectively, and B quarks with a mass mB < 480 GeV are excluded for singlets, all at 95% confidence level. Mass limits at 95% confidence level for T and B singlets, (T ,B) doublets and (X,T ) doublets are presented as a function of the corresponding heavy quark masses. For equal mass mT = mB and mX = mT vector-like quarks are excluded at 95% confidence level with masses below 550 GeV for T and B singlets, 640 GeV for a (T ,B) doublet and 640 GeV for a (X,T ) doublet.",

            "text": "Vector-like quarks [1][2][3] are new heavy quarks, in particular heavier than the top quark, which appear in many new physics models, such as extra dimensions, little Higgs, or composite Higgs models. Similar to a supersymmetric partner of the top quark, a vector-like top partner serves to stabilize the Higgs mass by cancelling the divergence of radiative corrections in the Higgs boson mass. Quarks are referred to as vector-like if their left-and right-handed chiralities transform in the same way under the electroweak group SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). Vector-like quarks can be classified as weak isospin singlets, doublets or triplets. The mass eigenstates of these vector-like quarks are referred to as T and B, with charges 2/3 and \u22121/3, respectively, and X and Y , with charges 5/3 and \u22124/3, respectively. It is assumed that the new quarks mainly couple to the third generation [4] which leads to the following possible decay modes:",

In this paper we give special attention to this scenario but also present results that can be interpreted under any mixture of these decay modes. In addition, the branching fractions for the T and B decay modes vary with the heavy quark masses m T and m B , respectively.

The ATLAS collaboration used a same-sign dilepton data sample equivalent to 4.7 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV to exclude both b \u2032 and vector-like quarks X with charge 5/3 (which they referred to as T 5/3 ) with masses below 670 GeV at 95% CL [7]. A similar analysis was performed by the CMS Collaboration using 5 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV to exclude vector-like quarks X with charge 5/3 with masses below 645 GeV at 95% CL [8].

            "text": "Same-sign-lepton or three-lepton signatures are also expected from many of the vector-like-quark final states discussed above. Accounting for all possible decay processes, for TT production the possible final states are W + bW \u2212 b, W bZt, W bHt, ZtZt, ZtHt and HtHt. For BB production the possible final states are W \u2212 tW + t, W tZb, W tHb, ZbZb, ZbHb and HbHb. For XX production the only possible final state is W + tW \u2212 t. For simplicity, here b represents both b andb, and analogously for top quarks. Among these, all final states except W + bW \u2212 b feature same-sign-lepton or three-lepton signatures. In this paper we exploit this feature and reinterpret the published CMS result [6] by relaxing the assumptions which determine the branching ratios as a function of mass to explore the entire space of possible branching ratios. A similar reinterpretation for arbitrary branching fractions was performed by ATLAS [9] for an analysis targeting the TT \u2192 W + bW \u2212 b hypothesis in a single-lepton final state and excluding at 95% CL T quarks with a mass 400 GeV < m T < 500 GeV for weak isospin singlets. Reinterpretations of results of specific T \u2192 W + b and T \u2192 Zt searches are also discussed in Ref. [10]. We show that these limits can be extended with the same-sign-lepton and three-lepton signatures, and we present limits for the T and B singlet and doublet, as well as for the (X,T ) doublet hypotheses as a function of the corresponding heavy quark masses. These represent important generalizations of the existing limits.",

For the trilepton analysis at least three isolated leptons must be identified, at least two of which must have an opposite charge, and at least two jets must be found. In all cases, at least one jet must be tagged as a b-jet using a tagger with roughly a 50% efficiency for identifying true b-jets, and events with two electrons or muons that are consistent with originating from a Z boson decay are rejected (|m ll \u2212 m Z | > 10 GeV).

For purposes of this validation, since CMS assumes BR(b \u2032 \u2192 W \u2212 t) = 1 [6][7][8], we apply a filter to force the vector-like-quarks to decay in the same manner (BR(B \u2192 W \u2212 t) = 1). Very good agreement is found as shown in Table I. We therefore conclude that our signal modeling and event selection are sufficiently accurate.   I: Here a comparison is made between the number of expected signal events passing the selection requirements of this paper and the selection requirements of the CMS paper. Results are shown for both the same-sign and the trilepton channels. In each case the first row shows the results using the generated samples and detector simulation of this paper (Protos BB production with PGS where both B quarks are forced to decay B \u2192 W t). The second row shows the quoted results from the CMS paper (MadGraph b \u2032b \u2032 production with CMS simulation). All results are shown for an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb \u22121 , with inclusive cross-sections determined using Hathor at NNLO. These cross-sections are verified to be identical to those of CMS. The CMS paper results include both statistical and systematic uncertainties, while the PGS result have statistical uncertainties only. The number of selected results appears to agree well with the CMS paper, suggesting that the samples and event selection used in this paper are sufficiently accurate for use in reinterpretations.",

To achieve full generality, for each mass point a two dimensional grid of all possible branching fractions is scanned in 10% steps.

The branching ratio of the Higgs-type decays follows from B H = 1 \u2212 B W \u2212 B Z . The probability for the production of each of the six possible combinations of decays of the two new heavy quarks then depends upon these branching fractions that we are assuming.

In particular, for the same-sign analysis the dominant background systematics are due to control-region estimations, which are not correlated to the signal uncertainties.

The CMS paper sets 95% exclusion limits on the b \u2032 model of 611 GeV. Limit setting was run using the published CMS numbers for the expected b \u2032 events passing their event selection, and including all approximations. An exclusion level of 98.1% was determined for the 550 GeV mass point, an exclusion limit of 96.1% was determined for the 600 GeV mass point, and an exclusion limit of 80.5% was determined for the 650 GeV mass point.

It should be noted that in the case of the singlet model there is no reason to assume that both a B and a T quark must be present. In case only a single quark is present, the limits can be extracted by considering the high-mass limit for the other quark in Figure 4.",

            "text": "We demonstrate in this paper that searches in final states with three isolated leptons (e or \u00b5) or two isolated leptons with same electric charge have a very good sensitivity to exotic heavy quarks T , B and X for all possible decay modes T \u2192 W + b, T \u2192 Zt, T \u2192 Ht, B \u2192 W \u2212 t, B \u2192 Zb, B \u2192 Hb and X \u2192 W + t. ATLAS and CMS searches in these final states have previously set limits assuming BR(b \u2032 \u2192 W \u2212 t) = 1 and BR(X \u2192 W + t) = 1. We reinterpret CMS results and generalize their limits for arbitrary branching ratios for heavy quark masses above 300 GeV.     At 95% CL we exclude T quarks with a mass m T < 480 GeV and m T < 550 GeV and B quarks with a mass m B < 480 GeV and m B < 610 GeV for weak isospin singlets and doublets, respectively. Mass limits at 95% CL for T and B singlets, (T ,B) doublets and (X,T ) doublets are presented as a function of the corresponding heavy quark masses. Under an equal mass hypothesis (m T = m B and m X = m T ) vector-like quarks are excluded at 95% CL with masses below 550 GeV for T and B singlets, 640 GeV for (T ,B) doublets (assuming V T b \u226a V tB ) and 640 GeV for (X,T ) doublets.
