GiBUU The GiBUU code provides a unified treatment of nuclear transport processes for interactions of nucleons, nuclei, pions, electrons and neutrinos with nuclei. The code provides a careful treatment of particle transport through the nucleus via the BUU equation. The neutrino-nucleon cross sections for single pion production account for 13 resonances with vector couplings taken from the MAID model for pion photo-and electroproduction, and axial couplings from PCAC. Nonresonant background terms are also included [13].  Figure 1 shows the total cross sections as a function of energy for CC1\u03c0 + and CC1\u03c0 0 . The predictions generally fall below the data in the case of CC1\u03c0 + , with GENIE coming closest. In CC1\u03c0 0 , the agreement with data is, on the whole, better, although there is still some tendency for predictions to fall below the data points. Figure 2 shows the ratio of total cross section prediction to data as a function of energy, for the two CC samples. A few features stand out. Firstly, although the predictions differ significantly in the overall normalization of the cross section, the shapes of the prediction/data ratios, particularly in CC1\u03c0 + , are quite similar, being higher at low energies than at higher energies. Secondly, although the CC1\u03c0 0 ratios also show similarities between the predictions, the shapes are quite different from the CC1\u03c0 + shapes. This suggests that the discrepancies between the predictions and the MiniBooNE data cannot be solely due to a mismodelling of the flux shape, which would lead to similar shapes in the two cases.",

Less optimistically, the difficulty of obtaining simultaneous agreement with the two CC samples highlights a potential problem for other experiments (especially neutrino oscillation experiments) in using the MiniBooNE data to constrain cross section predictions. An example of this is the T2K oscillation analysis, which introduced ad hoc tuning parameters with large uncertainties to reflect the difficulty of obtaining simultaneous agreement with the three MiniBooNE data sets [18]. Predictions and MiniBooNE data for the differential cross section d\u03c3 /dQ 2 , along with ratios, are shown in Figure 3. Again, the predictions differ in overall normalization of the cross section by up to 50%, but show similarities in shape, with the MiniBooNE data having greater strength in the Q 2 \u2248 0.5 GeV 2 region. The differential cross section in muon kinetic energy, shown in Figure 4, is strongly correlated with Q 2 , and so shows some differences in the level of agreement, as compared with the d\u03c3 /dQ 2 differential cross section. This suggests some further disagreement in the muon angle distribution. Figure 5 shows the differential cross sections in pion momentum (kinetic energy for CC1\u03c0 + ). These distributions are expected to be significantly altered by pion reinteractions within the nucleus, and so potentially provide an important test of final state effects.",
