            "text": "The production of heavy quarkonium at hadron colliders provides particular challenges and opportunities for insight into the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as its mechanisms of production operate at the boundary of the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Despite being among the most studied of the bound-quark systems, there is still no clear understanding of the mechanisms in the production of quarkonium states like the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 that can consistently explain both the production cross-section and spin-alignment measurements. Data obtained by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can help to test existing theoretical models of both quarkonium production and b-production in a new energy regime. The most important elements of the ATLAS detector for B physics measurements are the Inner Detector (ID) tracker and the Muon Spectrometer, details can be found in [1]. Dedicated B physics triggers are based on both single muons and di-muons with different thresholds and mass ranges.",

The ATLAS detector has a three-level trigger system: level 1 (L1), level 2 (L2) and the event filter (EF). In this measurement, the trigger relies on the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS) and the muon trigger chambers. The MBTS trigger is configured to require two hits above threshold from either side of the detector at the L1 level. Then a dedicated muon trigger at the EF level is required to confirm the candidate events chosen for this measurement. This trigger, initiated by the MBTS L1 trigger and searches for the presence of at least one track in the entire MS, is referred to as the EF minimum bias trigger. As the instantaneous luminosity of the collider increases, the trigger requirement switches from the EF minimum bias trigger to the EF arXiv:1307.4378v1 [hep-ex] 16 Jul 2013 muon trigger which seeded by this L1 muon trigger. The EF level pT cut of the EF muon trigger is 4 GeV initially and grows to 6 GeV later. The J/\u03c8 yields are determined by the number of J/\u03c8 candidates which are extracted from the observed dimuon pairs, with weights applied to unfold the acceptance, detector resolution, tracking, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies in each p T and rapidity bin. Studies are performed to assess all relevant sources of systematic uncertainty on the measurement of the J/\u03c8 inclusive production cross-section. Because the spin alignment of the J/\u03c8 is unknown at the LHC, an envelope of all possible spin alignment assumptions is taken and assigned as an additional systematic uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the measurement of the differential cross-sections of inclusive J/\u03c8 production, with the CMS result [3] included for comparison. The ATLAS and CMS results agree well in the overlapped regime. It is possible to distinguished the prompt J/\u03c8's produced directly from the p-p collision from the nonprompt J/\u03c8's produced in B-hadron decays by the measurably displaced decay point due to the long lifetime of their B-hadron parent. A simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit is applied to both invariant mass and lifetime ( Figure 2), which allows us to determine the fraction of non-prompt J/\u03c8 as a function of p T and rapidity. The result for one of the rapidity slices is shown in Figure 3, in good agreement with the CMS result [3]. This fraction is strongly dependent on p J/\u03c8 T with only weak dependence on \u03b7 J/\u03c8 . The result has been compared to the CDF result [4] indicating a limited dependence on collision energy.",

Muons are selected via a single muon trigger with a threshold of 4 GeV and are required to have p T > 4 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in order to remove the uncertainty associated with spin alignment in the cross-section measurement. The Figure 5: Dimuon mass distributions in 2 < p T < 4 GeV and 1.2 < |y| < 2.4 region. The data (filled circles) are shown together with the result of the unbinned maximum likelihood fit (histogram). The shaded histogram shows the background contribution, and the three other histograms show the contributions from the three \u03a5 states. All histograms are normalised by the factor determined in the fit. In the individual plots, the fitted N \u03a5(1S ) yield with its statistical uncertainty, the \u03c7 2 and the number of degrees of freedom are also given. It should be noted that this is simply a binned graphical representation of the fit; the actual fit is unbinned and interpolates the template histograms to obtain the input probability density function. \u03a5(1S ) yields are determined by correcting the number of reconstructed \u03a5(1S ) candidates with weights which unfold the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies in each p T and rapidity bin. The typical uncertainty is about 10 -15% at low p T and 35% at high p T and is dominated by the statistical precision of the data. The number of \u03a5(1S ) events is determined from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the dimuon mass distributions in each bin. The three \u03a5 signal templates are taken from the corresponding \u03a5 MC samples. The background templates are constructed from data by pairing a muon with a track reconstructed in the ID of opposite electric charge (OS). This template (denoted as OS \u00b5 + track) gives an adequate description of the background since its shape is primarily determined by the kinematic selection requirements. An example of the distributions and corresponding fit results is shown in Figure 5.",

The shaded area shows the change in the theoretical prediction when varying the renormalisation and factorization scales by a factor of two. The CSM NLO calculation accounts only for direct production of \u03a5(1S ) mesons and not for any feed-down from excited states.

Previous experiments have measured the \u03c7 b (1P) and \u03c7 b (2P) through decay modes of \u03c7 b (nP) \u2192 \u03a5(1S )\u03b3 and \u03c7 b (nP) \u2192 \u03a5(2S )\u03b3. In this measurement, a set of muon triggers designed to select events containing muon pairs or single high transverse momentum muons was used to collect the data sample. For each muon candidate it must have a track, reconstructed in the MS, combined with a track reconstructed in the ID with p T > 4 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.3. The di-muon selection requires a pair of oppositely charged muons, which are fitted to a common vertex. The di-muon candidate is also required to have p T > 12 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0.

This asymmetric mass window for \u03a5(2S ) candidates is chosen in order to reduce contamination from the \u03a5(3S ) peak and continuum background contributions. A photon is combined with each \u03a5 candidate. Both converted photons reconstructed by ID tracks from e + e \u2212 pairs with a conversion vertex and unconverted photos reconstructed by electromagnetic calorimeter energy deposit are used. The converted photon candidates are required to be within |\u03b7| < 2.30 while the unconverted photon candidates are required to be within |\u03b7| < 2.37. Unconverted photons must also be outside the transition region between the barrel and the endcap calorimeters, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52. Requirements of p T (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) > 20 GeV and p T (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) > 12 GeV are applied to \u03a5 candidates with unconverted and converted photon candidates respectively. These thresholds are chosen in order to optimize signal significance in the \u03c7 b (1P, 2P) peaks.

Also shown is the colour-singlet NLO (CSM)[11] prediction using m T = 4m 2 b + p 2 T (m b = 4.75 GeV) for the renormalisation and factorization scales. The shaded area shows the change in the theoretical prediction when varying the renormalisation and factorization scales by a factor of two. The CSM NLO calculation accounts only for direct production of \u03a5(1S ) mesons and not for any feed-down from excited states. The NRQCD prediction as implemented in Pythia8[12] is also shown for a particular choice of parameters.",
