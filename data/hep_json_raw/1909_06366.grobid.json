            "text": "Despite decades of research, we still lack a detailed quantitative understanding of the way quantum chromodynamics (QCD) generates the spectrum of hadrons. Precise experimental studies of the hadron excitation spectrum and the dynamics of hadrons help to improve models and to test effective theories and lattice QCD simulations. In addition, QCD seems to allow hadrons beyond the three-quark and quarkantiquark configurations of the constituent-quark model. These so-called exotic hadrons contain additional constituent (anti)quarks or excited gluonic fields that contribute to the quantum numbers of the hadron. Hadron spectroscopy is currently one of the most active fields of research in hadron physics. The COMPASS experiment at the CERN SPS is studying the excitation spectrum of light mesons, which are composed of up, down, and strange quarks. The excited mesons are produced via the strong interaction, i.e. by Pomeron exchange, by scattering a 190 GeV/c pion beam off proton or nuclear targets. On heavy nuclear targets, in addition the electromagnetic interaction contributes in the form of quasi-real photon exchange at very low four-momentum transfer squared. COMPASS has performed the most comprehensive analyses to date of isovector resonances decaying into \u03b7\u03c0, \u03b7 \u03c0, or \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final states. In this review, we give a general and pedagogical introduction into scattering theory and the employed partial-wave analysis techniques. We also describe novel methods developed for the high-precision COMPASS data. The COMPASS results are summarized and compared to previous measurements. In addition, we discuss possible signals for exotic mesons and conclude that COMPASS data provide solid evidence for the existence of the manifestly exotic \u03c0 1 (1600), which has quantum numbers forbidden for a quark-model state, and of the a 1 (1420), which does not fit into the quark-model spectrum. By isolating the contributions from quasi-real photon exchange, COMPASS has measured the radiative widths of the a 2 (1320) and, for the first time, that of the \u03c0 2 (1670) and has tested predictions of chiral perturbation theory for the process \u03c0 \u2212 + \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + .",

In the 20th century, scattering experiments with momentum transfers large enough to probe the internal structure of the colliding objects subsequently revealed the substructure of atoms, which are systems of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus bound together by the electromagnetic force, and that of atomic nuclei, which are composed of protons and neutrons held together by the nuclear or strong force. In addition to protons and neutrons, a large number of other strongly interacting particles, both with halfinteger spin (called baryons 2 ) and integer spin (called mesons 3 ), was observed in experiments with cosmic rays and later at particle accelerators. The lightest member of the meson family is the pion, which was discovered by Powell in 1947. The kaon, the lightest particle containing strange quarks, was observed by Rochester and Butler in 1947. Many heavier mesons and baryons followed, suggesting that pions, protons and neutrons (i.e. nucleons) were merely the lightest members of a large family of strongly interacting particles. Most of the heavier species of mesons and baryons are extremely unstable and decay after a very short time of the order of 10 \u221224 s. Today, more than 200 mesons and more than 100 baryons have been identified [5].",

Sorting the then-known baryons and mesons by their quantum numbers strong isospin and strangeness, which are known to be conserved in strong interactions, 4 hinted towards a further substructure of these strongly interacting particles. In the 1960s, Gell-Mann and Zweig suggested that hadrons could be made of more elementary objects called quarks. Three types or flavors of quarks, up (u), down (d), strange (s), carrying different charge, isospin, and strangeness were required to explain the quantum numbers of the observed hadrons. What started out merely as a mathematical tool, soon turned out to become reality, when electron-scattering experiments at SLAC began to show that protons did indeed contain point-like constituents, called partons by Feynman. In the 1970s, experiments colliding high-energy electrons with their antiparticles, positrons, revealed the existence of heavier types of quarks, carrying new quantum numbers called charm and bottomness (or beauty). In 1999, the sixth and heaviest quark, called top, was observed at Fermilab.",

The stable matter around us is entirely composed of fermions of the first generation, i.e. electrons and up and down quarks. The heavier fermions can be produced in high-energy particle collisions at accelerators or in cosmic-ray interactions. While the masses of the charged leptons can be measured directly, the masses of the quarks need to be determined indirectly, since they are confined inside hadrons and never appear as isolated particles (see below). The quark masses given in Table 1 are so-called current masses, which are the mass values of the bare quarks appearing in the QCD Lagrangian [6]. They are determined by comparing measured hadron properties with calculations, e.g. using Lattice QCD (see Section 2.4) or chiral perturbation theory (see Section 3.4) for the case of light quarks. In order to render the physical quantities calculated from the theory finite, a renormalization scheme needs to be applied, which requires the introduction of a scale parameter \u00b5. The most commonly applied scheme in QCD perturbation theory is the MS scheme and a typical scale is \u00b5 = 2 GeV. In the standard model of particle physics, the lepton number, i.e. the number of leptons minus the number of antileptons, N l \u2212 N l , is a strictly conserved quantity. Similarly, the baryon number B is strictly conserved. Quarks are assigned B = +1/3, antiquarks B = \u22121/3, while leptons have B = 0. By convention, the non-zero flavor quantum number of a quark (I 3 , S, C, B, or T) carries the same sign as its charge 5 . The generalized Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula relates the charge (in units of the elementary charge e) to the other additive quantum numbers of the quarks,",

There are three different strong charges, or colors, termed red, green, and blue. In contrast to photons, however, the gluons also carry charge, i.e. color, themselves and hence can also couple to themselves. 8 It is this self-interaction of the gluons which generates a wealth of new phenomena for strongly interacting particles, the two most important being confinement and asymptotic freedom of quarks, which will be explained in the following. At large momentum transfers, corresponding to distance scales much smaller than the size of a nucleon of about 1 fm, the quarks inside hadrons behave essentially as free particles. This asymptotic freedom allows the interaction to be treated perturbatively with a small coupling parameter \u03b1 s as series expansion parameter. It is in this regime, where predictions from QCD have been verified to very high precision. For larger distance scales approaching O(1 fm), the cloud of virtual gluons and qq pairs around quarks modifies their effective strong charge, similarly to the screening of the electric charge by the cloud of virtual photons fluctuating into e + e \u2212 pairs. Due to the self-interaction of gluons, however, there is an anti-screening of the strong charge, leading to an increased coupling strength at larger distances. This can be modeled by a potential between stationary quarks that consists of a Coulomb-like term for small distances r and increases linearly for larger distances, i.e.",

Various models and effective theories have been developed to describe composite systems of quarks and gluons and their complex excitation spectrum. Despite its conceptual simplicity, neglecting the afore-mentioned dynamic internal structure, the constituent-quark model, which is discussed in more detail in Section 2.1, can explain many properties of observed hadrons. Based on the concept of flavor symmetry, mesons are described in the quark model as bound states of an effective quark-antiquark system, while baryons are composed of three effective quarks. QCD, however, allows for a much larger variety of color-singlet bound systems, including multiquark states, molecule-like systems, or, owing to the fact that also gluons carry the charge of the strong interaction, systems where gluons explicitly contribute to the quantum numbers of the hadronic state. It is one of the most important questions in present-day hadronic physics whether such states exist or not.",

At the same time, many states predicted by the quark model are still unobserved or need confirmation. The COMPASS experiment is one of the key-players in the light-quark sector.

The experimentally observed approximate linear relation (\"Regge trajectories\") between spin and masssquared of mesons is shown to arise from a simple string model. Finally, we define the notion of exotic mesons, and show how lattice QCD may contribute to resolving some of the open questions. Section 3 gives a general and pedagogical overview over some of the theoretical concepts employed to analyze scattering experiments using the S-matrix approach. We discuss the kinematics for general two-body reactions and introduce the partial-wave expansion for spinless particles. Resonances are introduced both in the Breit-Wigner approximation and as poles of the analytic S-matrix in the complex plane. The consequences of unitarity of the S-matrix are discussed. Models which satisfy unitarity of the partial-wave amplitudes, like the K-matrix or the N -over-D method are briefly introduced. The consequences of unitarity on production reactions and final-state interactions are discussed. We continue by explaining some of the important concepts underlying Regge theory, which lead to an asymptotic description of scattering processes at high energies. The section ends with a brief discussion of chiral perturbation theory, which is the low-energy limit of QCD. Section 4.1 describes the dominant reaction mechanisms in the COMPASS kinematic domain, i.e. at high energies of the incoming particle beam, before Section 4 introduces the COMPASS experimental apparatus used for hadron spectroscopy. Based on the more general account in Section 3, Section 5 provides a detailed derivation of the partial-wave analysis (PWA) formalism used to decompose the measured data into partial-wave amplitudes with a given spin-parity assignment. Special attention is paid to new developments which are expected to reduce the model-dependence of the analysis, like the freed-isobar PWA (Section 5.2.9), or help to better constrain the fit by fulfilling some of the fundamental properties of the S-matrix (Section 5.3.5). In Section 6 we finally present the most important results from the analysis of diffractive dissociation reactions, while in Section 7 we discuss the results from Primakoff reactions. The review closes with conclusions and an outlook in Section 8. In several appendices we provide more detailed mathematical formulae, which are useful for PWA practitioners.",

The quark model by Gell-Mann and Zweig explains the multiplet structure of observed mesons when classified by total spin, isospin and strong hypercharge, by identifying them as composite objects of a quark and an antiquark (see Section 2.1.1). The excitation spectrum can be calculated in the quark model by parameterizing the quark-antiquark interaction by effective Hamiltonians, which include a Coulomb-like attractive potential that dominates at small separations, and a linearly increasing potential that dominates for larger distances. We confront a recent relativistic quark-model calculation with present-day experimental data (see Section 2.1.2). A linear confining potential between more fundamental constituents is also needed to explain the approximate linear relation between the total spin and the squared mass for certain groups of mesons (\"Regge trajectories\"), which had been noticed even before the advent of the quark model in the early 1960s. A simple model of a rotating string first proposed by Nambu is presented as illustration in Section 2.2. Regge theory, which will be summarized in Section 3.2, links the observed trajectories to the forces between quarks and to the highenergy behavior of the scattering amplitude. Regge trajectories can help to assign experimentally observed resonances to states predicted by quark models. States not fitting the model predictions are generally termed exotic. We discuss candidates for light exotic states (see Section 2.3) and show that lattice QCD, providing hints towards the structure of the meson spectrum from first principles, also predicts the existence of a group of exotic states called hybrids (see Section 2.4).",

As their counterparts, the valence electrons in atoms, valence quarks determine the quantum numbers, the excitation spectrum, and the interactions of hadrons.

Experimental results for all mesons below a mass of 2.5 GeV appearing in the full listing of the Particle Data Group (PDG) [5] are displayed as data points, with the uncertainties on the masses as error bars. Full dots denote established states, open circles non-established states, which need confirmation, while open squares indicate states in the \"Further States\" listing of the PDG. As for the RQM states, the experimental states with I = 1 are shifted to the left, the ones with I = 0 to the right. The assignment to RQM states follows [16], except in a few cases where the PDG entries changed in the meantime. States appearing in the \"Further States\" listing of the PDG are included only if they were explicitly assigned to RQM states. Blue data points indicate states which have been assigned to RQM states, while red data points designate states which have not been assigned, and are thus considered potentially supernumerary.

Its slope, however, is slightly different as it is dominated by the ground state \u03c0. This indicates the dual nature of the \u03c0 as a ground-state meson and a Goldstone boson of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (see e.g. Ref. [21] and references therein). Radially excited meson states are observed to fall on trajectories with slopes similar to their parent n = 1 trajectories, but shifted to higher masses. They are hence called daughter trajectories. Linear trajectories for quark-model meson families can be observed not only in the M 2 -J plane, but also in the M 2 -n r plane (see e.g. Ref. [16]), n r being the number of radial nodes of the wave function. In addition, Fig. 5 includes the so-called Pomeron trajectory,",

The most prominent configurations are shown in Fig. 6. Tetraquarks (Fig. 6a) are color-singlet objects formed by a color-octet diquark and a color-octet anti-diquark bound by gluon exchanges. Molecular configurations ( Fig. 6b) include two color-singlet qq pairs bound by long-range meson exchanges. Owing to the non-Abelian structure of QCD, additional configurations are possible, in which an excited gluonic field contributes to the quantum numbers of the meson. States with a valence color-octet qq pair neutralized in color by an excited gluon field are termed hybrids (Fig. 6c). Finally, due to the self-interaction of gluons, color-singlet states can in principle also be composed entirely of multiple gluonic excitations without valence quarks; such objects are generically called glueballs (Fig. 6d).",

If observed, such states are considered strong candidates for gluonic excitations like hybrids or glueballs (which are then called oddballs), because the gluonic field may carry quantum numbers different from 0 ++ . However, also molecular or multi-quark states may have spin-exotic quantum numbers. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there are two light-meson candidate states with spin-exotic quantum numbers listed by the PDG: the \u03c0 1 (1400) and the \u03c0 1 (1600) [5]. Their nature as a resonance has been the subject of a long-standing controversy, which has recently been resolved thanks to the data of the COMPASS experiment. This is discussed in more detail in Section 6.3.3. The unambiguous identification of exotic states with the same quantum numbers as ordinary qq mesons, so-called cryptoexotic mesons, is difficult because they will only appear as supernumerary states in the observed spectrum for a given J P C , possibly mixing with the corresponding conventional qq states. For such states, their fitting into Regge trajectories (see Section 2.2) can be a useful criterion for their classification. Experimental states labelled as \"not assigned\" (red data points) in the columns corresponding to qq configurations in Fig. 3 are potential candidates for supernumerary states, however, a full understanding of the qq spectrum is a prerequisite for claiming such states. There is evidence that the light scalar states indeed agree with a tetraquark interpretation. The recent observation of the a 1 (1420) by COMPASS is another example of a potentially supernumerary state in the 1 ++ sector, which will be discussed in more detail in Section 6.3.2.",

In recent years, many new and unexpected resonance-like signals have been observed in the heavy-quark sector. Many of these so-called X, Y , Z states are candidates for exotic configurations of mesons. Similar studies in the light-quark sector are more challenging due to the wide and overlapping nature of the known resonances, but have also revealed possible candidates, in particular for hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom. Still, one expects to find not only single states, but whole multiplets of states with similar masses, similar to the qq multiplets. It remains an open question, whether these multiplets simply have evaded detection until now or whether they are not realized in nature as expected. In order to settle this fundamental question, large data sets with high statistical precision are needed. The unambiguous identification of exotic states requires experiments with complementary production mechanisms and the analysis of different final states. In Section 8, we will briefly discuss some running and upcoming high-precision experiments, which are expected to shed new light on the existence of exotic states in nature.",

Unfortunately, lattice QCD calculations of excited hadron resonances still need to be performed at rather high pion masses as will be discussed further below.",

Figure 7 shows the spectrum of light non-strange mesons from the lattice QCD calculation in Ref. [29]. The spectrum is qualitatively similar to the one predicted by quark models (see Fig. 3), but lattice QCD predicts also the existence of exotic non-qq states that are discussed in Section 2.3. The masses of the states depend on the pion mass used in the calculation. The lowest pion mass used in Ref. [29] is 391 MeV/c 2 , which is still far away from the physical point. Since the simulation did not include multi-hadron operators, the extracted states are quasi-stable and their masses are in general not identical to the resonance masses. For the same reason, this calculation cannot predict widths and decay modes of the states. For this, one still has to rely on models for most of the states.",

This means that within the cube of finite volume L 3 s , free particles can only have discrete three-momenta p = (2\u03c0/L s ) (n x , n y , n z ) with integer n i . Hence in scattering processes, multi-hadron states are limited to a discrete spectrum of states, which are the energies of the eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian in a finite box. The simplest case is the decay of a state into two (quasi-)stable particles, e.g. two pions. The energies of the two-particle state depend on the interactions between these particles. By inverting this relation, one can extract information about scattering amplitudes, e.g. scattering phase shifts, from the volume dependence of the discrete spectrum in a finite volume. This idea goes back to M. L\u00fcscher [39,40]. It was developed into a general method to calculate scattering amplitudes for all possible 2 \u2192 2 scattering processes of mesons by including hadron-hadron operators that, for example, represent \u03c0\u03c0 or KK systems with defined momenta of the particles (see Ref. [33] and references therein). The resonances, which may appear in these scattering processes, are extracted by analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude into the complex energy-plane, where the resonances appear as poles (see Section 3.1). Calculations of this kind have been performed, for example, for the \u03c0\u03c0 system (see e.g. Refs. [41,42]) and the coupled \u03c0\u03b7 and KK system (see Ref. [43]).",

For low-energy hadronic interactions, effective Lagrangians may be employed to calculate the amplitude [48]. For light hadrons, chiral perturbation theory is the low-energy effective theory of QCD (see Section 3.4). For high energies, the framework of Regge theory, discussed in Section 3.2, provides some guidance on the asymptotic behavior of scattering amplitudes. The intermediate energy-regime is governed by hadronic resonances, for which no fundamental theory exists, and for which the amplitudes need to be parameterized using phenomenological models. Lorentz-invariance requires the invariant amplitude to be a Lorentz scalar, which may therefore be written as a function of Lorentz scalars only. In case of spinless particles, which we will assume here for simplicity, M f i is thus a function of scalar products of four-momenta only. The unitarity condition Eq. (38) can be written in terms of the invariant amplitude",

In Fig. 10a the relativistic form is compared to the non-relativistic form. For elastic scattering, the locus of \u03c1(s) t (s) follows a circle of unit diameter around the point 0 + i/2 in counterclockwise direction in the Argand diagram shown in Fig. 10b.

The second sheet II is called \"unphysical\", but, as we will see, may have a large influence on the amplitude along the physical axis. The opening of an additional channel, e.g. above the three-particle threshold 9m 2 for equal-mass particles, defines a new branch point and a corresponding cut. For n channels, there are 2 n Riemann sheets. By convention, the cut corresponding to the lowest threshold is drawn along the positive real s axis, and thus passes through all other branch points, as indicated in Fig. 13. This is called the right-hand (or normal-threshold) cut, which is a consequence of unitarity when the amplitude is viewed as a function of complex variables. It has a clear dynamical origin, namely the opening of the two-particle threshold. In Eq. (77), another branchpoint at s = 0 appears, which we ignored up to now. It appears purely because of kinematics and is hence called a kinematic singularity. For the case of the phase-space factor, one can get rid of it by using e.g. the Chew-Mandelstam phase-space function [57][58][59], which is an analytic continuation of Eq. (77). In general, one usually tries to parameterize amplitudes such ) as a filled circle.

Analyticity allows us to continue the amplitude from the physically allowed region for the s-channel to the t-and u-channel regions. Analogously to the s-channel, where a stable bound state with mass M b < 4m 2 gives rise to a pole of the amplitude at s = s b \u2261 M 2 b on the real axis of the physical sheet, a stable bound state in the u-channel leads to a pole at u = u b .

Similarly, physical thresholds in the u-channel lead to branch cuts in the s-plane starting from the two-body branch point u = 4m 2 and extending to infinity along the negative real axis (left-hand cut), as depicted schematically in Fig. 14 for fixed t.

Here, we only review some simple results based on Cauchy's integral formula [51], which states that  110is that once a function is known on a closed contour C, it is known everywhere in the region interior to C. If f (s ) is free of singularities and has only one branch point at s = s thr and a corresponding cut extending from s thr to +\u221e, we can deform the contour C to C such that its radius goes to infinity and that it excludes the branch cut, as shown in Fig. 15. Assuming that f (s ) vanishes faster than 1/s for |s| \u2192 \u221e, the circular integral along the dashed line in Fig. 15 does not contribute. The only remaining parts of the integral are the integrals along straight lines in opposite directions above and below the cut, i.e.",

(69)), and the s-channel expansion will no longer converge. There is, however, an interrelation between the cross section for high-energy s-channel scattering and the exchange of color-singlet clusters of quarks and gluons in the t-channel, as depicted in Fig. 17b. It turns out that reactions, for which the exchange of low-mass particles or resonances is allowed in the t-channel, have considerably higher cross sections than those, for which the exchanged quantum numbers do not correspond to resonances. The allowed quantum numbers for the t-channel exchanges are determined by the quantum numbers of the initial and final states of the corresponding t-channel reaction 1 + 3 \u2192 2 + 4 (see Section 3.1.2). Examples are the reactions K \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a3 + and pp \u2192 \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3 + , which are both strongly forward peaked and consequently have a large total cross section. Regge theory links this experimental observation to the fact that these reactions may proceed via t-channel exchange of K * and K or K * , respectively [72]. This is in contrast to the reactions K \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 and pp \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03a3 \u2212 , which have a much smaller cross section with no strong dependence on the scattering angle [73,74], because there are no known resonances with the necessary quantum numbers for t-channel exchange. According to Eq. (4), the longest-range component of the force between two hadrons is provided by the exchange of the lightest color-singlet object carrying the quantum numbers required by conservation laws. The exchange of heavier particles will lead to contributions at shorter ranges. Therefore, Yukawa's simple one-pion exchange between interacting hadrons is merely a limiting case of a much more complicated picture. Regge theory provides the generalization of the one-pion exchange model and turned out to be very successful in describing high-energy scattering processes of hadrons.",

[77,78]). For scattering from a superposition of Yukawa potentials, t(\u03b1, t) is found to be an analytic function except for a number of simple poles in the complex \u03b1-plane called Regge poles or Reggeons, which depend on t and which we denote as \u03b1 1 (t), \u03b1 2 (t), . . . , \u03b1 n (t). The term \"Regge trajectory\" is used both for the paths traced out in the complex \u03b1-plane by the functions \u03b1 i (t) as t varies and for Re[\u03b1 i (t)] plotted against t. As long as a Regge trajectory \u03b1 i (t) remains far away from integer values of \u03b1, there will be little influence of the corresponding pole on t(\u03b1, t)| \u03b1= . But if one of the Regge trajectories, \u03b1 n (t), passes close to a particular integer value of = J for a given t = t 0 , such that Re[\u03b1 n (t 0 )] = J and Im[\u03b1 n (t 0 )] 1, the amplitude t(\u03b1, t)| \u03b1=J will be dominated by this Regge pole for t \u2248 t 0 . The value of t 0 , for which \u03b1 n (t 0 ) \u2248 J, corresponds to the squared mass M 2 J of a strong interaction resonance with spin J. 35 A Regge trajectory passing very close to several integer values of = 0, 1, 2, . . . along the real axis of the complex \u03b1-plane as t increases thus predicts a sequence of resonances with spin J = 0, 1, 2, . . . with increasing masses. As was shown in Section 2.2, Fig. 5, the experimentally observed hadrons can indeed be arranged in such families of resonances, having the same quantum numbers I, I 3 , P , and S. In addition to non-relativistic scattering theory, this observation provides another justification for the rather bold extension to complex angular momentum in Regge theory.",

An example is the charge-exchange reaction \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n, which in the t-channel reaction \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u2192 pn has quantum numbers I = 1, P = \u22121, and G = +1, and thus proceeds via exchange of the \u03c1 trajectory. The measurement of the differential cross section therefore gives the continuation of the \u03c1 trajectory to negative values of t [81]. Figure 19 shows the scattering data from Ref. [81] together with an extrapolation of the linear \u03c1 trajectory fitted to the masses of {\u03c1, \u03c1 3 , \u03c1 5 } (cf. Fig. 5).

The f mesons carry the required quantum numbers, but the y-axis intercept \u03b1(0) of the corresponding Regge trajectory is too low (see Fig. 5). The Pomeron trajectory has \u03b1 P (0) 1, but there is no pole and thus no corresponding physical particle near t = 0, because J = 1 corresponds to negative signature, whereas the Pomeron is postulated to have positive signature [79].. The lowest-mass physical particle of the Pomeron trajectory could have \u03b1 P = J = 2, but has not been identified uniquely until now. It seems plausible to assume that the flavorless exchange in elastic scattering is dominated by gluon ladders, in contrast to ordinary Regge trajectories, which include the exchange of valence quarks. This might also explain why the Pomeron trajectory has a different slope compared to all other meson Regge trajectories (see Fig. 5). According to Eq. (21), a different slope also corresponds to a different string tension for the Pomeron. Glueballs are discussed as good candidates for physical particle states on the Pomeron trajectory.",

            "text": "So far, we have treated the two-body s-channel scattering reaction 1 + 2 \u2192 3 + 4 either via scattering through intermediate s-channel resonances (see Section 3.1) or via the exchange of resonances in the t-channel (see Section 3.2), suggesting that the s-channel resonance mechanism dominates at low energies, while the t-channel exchanges are responsible for the high-energy behavior of the amplitude (cf. also Fig. 17). These two pictures, however, are not independent of each other, as the discussion on experimental cross sections for certain reactions in Section 3.2.1 has shown. The two approaches are rather two alternative or dual ways of describing the same dynamics. One cannot easily combine the two pictures by simply adding the corresponding amplitudes without violating unitarity. The amplitude for a given s-channel reaction is in principle fully determined by summing up the infinite partial-wave series Eq. (71) in the s-channel. This, however, is technically difficult, because, at least at high center-of-momentum energies like at COMPASS, many high-spin waves will still contribute significantly to the sum. Therefore, in practice, one has to truncate the s-channel partial-wave expansion at some value of . The contributions from higher-spin partial waves are then often taken into account by effective background terms, which are represented by t-channel exchanges. One example is the Deck-background (see Fig. 21d), which is further discussed in Section 4.1. It should be noted, however, that this is an effective description of the amplitude, which results from the truncation of the partial-wave series. The splitting is of course not unique and sometimes reaction-dependent. This may result in reaction-dependent resonance parameters [52]. The pole positions in the complex s-plane and their residues (i.e. couplings), however, should be universal and reaction-independent. Care has to be taken in order not to violate the unitarity condition for the S-matrix Eq. (32) when including background terms in a model. This has been studied extensively for two-body or quasi-two-body scattering (see e.g. Refs. [59,64,88]), and is currently being worked on for three-body scattering (see e.g. Refs. [89][90][91][92] and references therein).",

In the limit of zero masses of the light quarks, the left-handed and right-handed quark fields decouple from each other in the QCD Lagrangian. This leads to a SU(3) flavor,L \u00d7 SU(3) flavor,R symmetry, which is called chiral symmetry. This symmetry can be exploited to construct the low-energy effective field theory of QCD, where, instead of quarks and gluons, hadrons are the relevant degrees of freedom. This approach is called Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT), which allows the calculation of amplitudes of strong-interaction processes by performing a systematic expansion in powers of the particle momenta (for details see e.g. Refs. [21,48] and references therein). In this regard, it differs from the usual perturbative approach, which is a power-series expansion in the coupling constant of the interaction. The energy scale, defining the applicability of \u03c7PT, is defined by the mass of the pion. The \u03c7PT expansion contains universal and process-independent lowenergy constants. The values of these constants have to be determined by experiments or by other theoretical calculations, such as lattice QCD. The leading-order mesonic Lagrangian contains two low-energy constants: the pion-decay constant and the scalar quark condensate. The most general next-to-leading-order Lagrangian contains 10 low-energy constants [93].",

            "text": "A variety of experimental approaches has been developed to produce excited light-meson states and to study their properties [14]. Such resonances can be produced either in scattering experiments through the interaction of two colliding particles or as intermediate states in the decay of heavier states. Scattering experiments can be further categorized in production and formation experiments. In formation experiments, resonances are formed in the s-channel without a recoil particle. The invariant mass and the quantum numbers of the intermediate and the final state are fixed by the initial state. Hence formation experiments only yield final states with non-exotic quantum numbers. In production experiments, the total energy is shared between a multi-meson final state and a recoil particle. Hence measurements at a single centerof-momentum energy are sufficient to cover a wide mass range of the multi-meson final state. Since the quantum numbers of the produced multi-meson system are restricted only by the conservation laws of the interaction, both non-exotic and exotic states (see Section 2.3) can be produced. At high \u221a s, production reactions via t-channel exchanges dominate the cross section. The dominant contributions in the COMPASS kinematic domain will be described in this section. COMPASS is a production experiment where light mesons are produced in inelastic scattering of a \u03c0 \u2212 beam off proton or nuclear targets. At the COMPASS beam momentum of 190 GeV/c, which corresponds to a center-of-momentum energy \u221a s of approximately 19 GeV, the total \u03c0 \u2212 p cross section is approximately 24 mb [94,95] (see also Fig. 18), whereas the elastic \u03c0 \u2212 p cross section is only about 3 mb [96,97]. This means that most of the scattering processes are inelastic. In these inelastic processes, particles may be produced in various ways. COMPASS has performed exclusive measurements of various produced final states. In this paper, we report on the \u03b7\u03c0 p, \u03b7 \u03c0 p, and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + p final states. For the process \u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + p, for example, a total cross section of 635 \u00b1 61 \u00b5b was measured at a similar beam energy of 205 GeV [98], which corresponds to 18 \u00b1 2 % of the total 4-prong cross section 37 of about 3.5 mb [96] and to about 2.6 % of the total cross section. In order to study excited mesons, we select processes, where the target proton scatters elastically (see Section 4). In these reactions, the produced final-state particles hence originate from the beam particle (see Fig. 20). These processes of the form \u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 X + p are called single-diffraction dissociation processes 38 and are characterized by the relation s m 2 X t, where s and t are the Mandelstam variables of the scattering process as defined in Eqs. (43) and (44) and m X is the invariant mass of the X system. For a 205 GeV \u03c0 \u2212 beam, the pion single-diffraction cross section for the inclusive reaction \u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 X + p was measured to about 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 mb [99]. For the channel X = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , for example, it was found that about 2/3 of the total cross section of 635 \u00b1 61 \u00b5b quoted above is due to dissociation of the beam pion, whereas about 1/3 is due to dissociation of the target proton [98].",

Since the target proton remains intact in the reaction, only exchanges with Q = 0, I = 0, 1, and Y = 0 are possible. Ordinary meson Regge trajectories like the \u03c1, \u03c9, or f 2 are suppressed due to the high center-of-momentum energy (see Section 3.  Because of the approximately exponential behavior of the differential cross section d\u03c3/ dt in Eq. (133), diffractive reactions are characterized by low values of the reduced four-momentum transfer squared t (see Eq. (53)). We therefore limit our analyses to the range t < 1 (GeV/c) 2 . Due to the small t , the X system is produced at small scattering angles and carries most of the beam energy. This means that the X system is strongly forward boosted. In contrast, the recoiling target proton has only low momentum and is emitted under large angles with respect to the beam axis. Hence particles emitted from the target vertex are kinematically well separated from the particles of the X decay. This fact is also referred to as rapidity gap. We require a rapidity gap in the trigger condition of the experiment (see Section 4).",

In these processes, two Reggeons are exchanged and the produced forwardgoing particles do not originate from the decay of a common resonant intermediate state X. Hence for a given measured final state, double-Regge exchange processes constitute irreducible non-resonant background contributions to the resonance production in Fig. 21a. However, resonances still may appear in subsystems X of the final state. Various Reggeons may be exchanged and Figs. 21c and 21d show only two examples of whole set of possible diagrams. The exchanged Reggeons affect the kinematic distribution of the corresponding events. There are two special cases, which play a role in the analysis of COMPASS data. In central-production reactions, beam and target particle each scatter elastically and a resonance is produced by the fusion of two Reggeons as shown in Fig. 21c. Such processes are characterized kinematically by a fast scattered beam particle, which usually carries a larger momentum than the other final-state particles. Hence backgrounds from central production to diffractive reactions are usually small because they can be separated kinematically. Another class of double-Regge exchange processes is the so-called Deck process [100], where the resonant intermediate state is produced at the beam vertex and a pion is exchanged. The pion interacts with the target particle via Pomeron exchange and emerges as a final-state particle (see Fig. 21d). The Deck process is kinematically less well separable from single-diffraction and therefore plays an important role in the analysis.",

Figure 22c shows, as an example, one of the possible t-channel processes, which correspond to the non-resonant processes shown in Figs. 21c and 21d. As was discussed in Section 3.3, s and t-channel processes are related by duality. The applied truncated partial-wave expansion in the s-channel provides only an effective description of the data and the partialwave amplitudes that are estimated from the data contain contributions from s as well as t-channel processes that need to be taken into account when modelling the partial-wave amplitudes in terms of resonances, which will be discussed in Section 5.3.",

Particles emitted from the production target are captured using a set of 6 high-gradient, large-acceptance quadrupoles. Momentum and charge selection is performed in several dipole magnets and collimators along the beam line, with the goal to achieve a momentum resolution below 1%. The maximum beam momentum for the used beam-line optics is 225 GeV/c; momenta up to 280 GeV/c can be reached with a slightly larger momentum spread.

First, it was used in the trigger to select single-diffractive events with a recoiling proton. Second, the information from this detector is used in the offline analysis (see Section 4.2.8) to fully reconstruct the produced final states and to ensure the exclusivity of the processes under investigation by measuring the velocity and the energy loss of particles recoiling from the target at angles between 50 \u2022 and 90 \u2022 with respect to the beam axis (z axis). With this information, double-diffraction events with simultaneous excitation of the target particle (see Section 4.1) were suppressed by about one order of magnitude. The PRD consists of two concentric barrels (\"rings\") made of plastic scintillator slabs (12 for the inner ring with radius 12 cm, 24 for the outer ring with radius 75 cm), with a length of  50 cm and 115 cm, respectively. Each slab is read out from both sides by photomultiplier tubes, providing position resolutions along z of \u03c3 z = 2.7 cm and 5.0 cm for the inner and outer ring slabs, respectively. RPD straight radial track candidates are reconstructed by combining hits from the inner ring elements with the corresponding outer ring elements in the azimuthal range covered by the inner element.. The momenta of the recoil particles are calculated from the measured time-of-flight using the proton-mass hypothesis, applying a momentum correction to take into account the energy loss in the material crossed. Protons recoiling from the target at large angles can be identified by their energy loss in the outer ring up to a velocity of \u03b2 = 0.4. A lower momentum cut-off of 270 MeV/c for detectable recoil protons is given by the energy loss in the target walls and the inner ring. This translates into a minimum momentum transfer of |t| = 0.07 (GeV/c) 2 . For measurements with nuclear targets, the recoil particle is mostly stopped inside the target and hence does not reach the recoil detector.",

One station comprises two silicon detectors, each read out by microstrips with a pitch of about 50 \u00b5m on both sides, oriented in perpendicular directions.

Its large aperture matches the opening of the RPD and the Sandwich Veto. Tracking is performed using different types of planar gaseous detectors, depending on the surface to be covered, the expected rates and the required resolutions. The large-area tracking is performed by drift chambers, drift tubes, and multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) with active areas up to 5 m 2 . All of them have central inactive areas with diameters of 20 to 30 cm, covered by Micropattern Gaseous Detectors with higher rate capabilities and better resolutions. Upstream of SM1, this region is covered by Micromegas (Micromesh Gaseous Structure) detectors, optimized for operation in hadron beams [102]. Downstream of SM1, GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors with a two-coordinate readout [105] are used for this purpose. Since both GEMs and Micromegas feature strippatterned anodes, they have a central inactive region of 5 cm diameter in order to avoid excessive pile-up of signals on the central strips due to beam particles. For tracking directly in and close to the beam region, GEM detectors with pixelized anodes (PixelGEMs) [106] are installed in replacement of all but one scintillating-fibre counters previously used with the muon beam. The momentum resolution for charged particles with momenta from 1 up to about 15 GeV/c, detected only in the LAS, was determined to be between 1.1 and 1.5%. Charged hadrons are identified in a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) filled with C 4 F 10 gas [107]. The Cherenkov light emitted by charged particles passing the radiator gas is focused by a large mirror onto two different types of photon detectors located outside of the geometrical acceptance of the spectrometer. In the peripheral region, MWPCs with CsI photocathodes are used, while the central region is instrumented with multi-anode photomultipliers. The RICH can be used to distinguish pions and kaons with momenta between 5 and 43 GeV/c at a level of 2.5\u03c3 or better.",

These are determined by an iterative software alignment procedure using tracks recorded at low beam intensity both with spectrometer magnets off and on. The association of detector clusters to track candidates is performed by first searching for straight track segments in regions without or negligible magnetic field and without large amounts of material. These segments are then bridged across the magnets and absorber walls by extrapolation and matching within a variable road width and by comparing the track segments to a dictionary of reconstructable tracks.

Based on Eq. 57in Section 3.1.3, we construct a model for the cross section of reaction (139) by assuming that the n-body final state is produced via t-channel exchange processes and by performing an s-channel partial-wave expansion of the n-body system by inserting a complete set of intermediate states X with well defined quantum numbers. We hence subdivide process (139) into two subprocesses: (i) an inelastic two-body scattering reaction a + b \u2192 X + c and (ii) the subsequent decay of state X into the n-body final state, i.e. X \u2192 1 + 2 + . . . + n. This is shown in Fig. 33. Subprocess (i) is described in terms of the invariant mass m X of the n-body system and the two Mandelstam variables s and t, where s is the squared center-of-momentum energy of the (a, b) system (see Eq. 43) and t the transferred squared four-momentum (see Eq. 44). For convenience, we use instead of t the positive definite reduced squared four-momentum transfer t as defined in Eq. 53. For a fixed-target experiment such as COMPASS, p a and p b are constant and hence the center-of-momentum energy \u221a s of the scattering reaction is fixed. In this case, the kinematic distribution of the final-state particles depends on m X , t , and a set of (3n \u2212 4) additional phase-space variables (see Section 3.1.1) represented by \u03c4 n . These phase-space variables fully describe the n-body decay and will be defined in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.4. Analogous to subdividing the scattering process, we split the phase space of the (n+1) outgoing particles into a two-body phase space for X and c (see Eq. (60)) and an n-body phase space for the decay X \u2192 1 + 2 + . . . + n (see Eq. (41)). For any given choice of the phase-space variables \u03c4 n , the Dirac delta function in Eq. (41) that represents four-momentum conservation can be integrated out so that the differential phasespace element can be written as",

The inner sum runs over the subsets S i of the indices of those resonances that contribute to partial wave i. The same resonance may appear in several waves and several resonances may appear in the same wave. Depending on the context, the partial-wave index i has two meanings. It either represents directly the set of quantum numbers that define a partial-wave amplitude as in Eq. (162) or it enumerates all waves consecutively, i.e. i is an integer that uniquely identifies a specific wave as in Eq. (166). Equation 166is a model for the (2 + 3n \u2212 4)-dimensional intensity distribution I(m X , t , \u03c4 n ) as defined in Eq. (143). In principle, the best possible approach would be to fit Eq. (166) directly to the data. Such an approach is often called global fit. However, in many cases it is impractical or even impossible to perform such a global fit. One of the reasons for this is that the set {k} of resonances that contribute to the intermediate states X is usually unknown, as are the corresponding resonance parameters. It is the goal of the analysis to determine the resonance content and the resonance parameters from the data. Often, the analysis is guided by information from the kinematic distributions, in particular from the invariant mass distribution of the n-body final state, and by results from previous experiments. As was discussed in Section 4.1, the identification of resonances in the data is complicated by contributions from non-resonant components that have to be taken into account. This will be discussed further in Section 5.3. Also the values of the coupling amplitudes {C ki (t )} are in general unknown and have to be inferred from data. Up to now there are no models that are able to describe the details of the t dependence of the coupling amplitudes. Finally, even if a realistic model of the form of Eq.

(143). The goal of the first analysis stage is to determine the set {T i (m X , t )} of transition amplitudes from the data. This is possible because we can calculate the decay amplitudes \u03a8 i (m X , \u03c4 n ) for a given value of m X assuming that we know the propagator terms of all intermediate isobar resonances that appear in Eq. (167) via Eq. (152) precisely and without any free parameters. In order to avoid modeling of the m X and t dependence of the transition amplitudes, the partial-wave decomposition is performed in small (m X , t ) cells. This yields binned approximations to the T i (m X , t ) and will be explained in Section 5.2. Because of this binning approach, the first analysis stage makes no assumptions about the resonance content of the partial waves. Based on the isobar model for the n-body decay of X, the data are decomposed into partial-wave amplitudes with well-defined quantum numbers that are given by the partial-wave index i as defined in Eq. (162). One may think of the partial-wave decomposition as merely a transformation of the data from four-momentum space of the final-state particles into the space of transition amplitudes. This yields a representation of the data in terms of intensities and relative phases of transition amplitudes that allows for a direct interpretation in terms of resonances. As was discussed in Section 4.1, the extracted partial-wave amplitudes also contain contributions from non-resonant processes that have to be taken into account by the resonance model (see discussion below). Since the partialwave decomposition takes into account the detection and reconstruction efficiency of the experimental setup (see Section 5.2.5) and thanks to the chosen normalization (see Section 5.2.4), the results can be directly compared across experiments. It is important to note that the model in Eq. (167) describes the density of events differential in all phase-space variables. As a consequence, the partial-wave decomposition is able to extract the interference even between waves i and j that have different quantum numbers and hence correspond to orthogonal decay amplitudes, for which\u00b4d\u03a6",

This will be explained in Section 5.3. It is important to note that the resonance-model fit does not have to describe all transition amplitudes that are extracted from the data, but may focus on selected partial waves. This is in particular important for the analysis of the high-energy scattering reactions considered here, where often sizable non-resonant components contribute to X (see Section 4.1). These non-resonant contributions project into all transition amplitudes and often dominate the intensity of high-spin waves. Such waves are only important to describe the data but are uninteresting when it comes to extracting resonances. They are therefore not included in resonance-model fits.",

It therefore does not make any assumptions about the resonance content of the transition amplitudes. The only model dependence that enters at this point is the truncation of the partial-wave expansion, i.e. the set of waves used in Eq. (168). This issue will be discussed in Section 5.2.8. In addition, the kinematic cells are statistically independent so that the partial-wave decomposition can be performed in parallel. A caveat of the binning approach is that the method introduces a large number of free parameters-the values of the transition amplitudes in each (m X , t ) cell-that need to be determined from data. For that reason, this approach is only applicable to sufficiently large data sets. In order to make the PWA model more realistic, Eq.

If, hypothetically, the target proton would be excited into an N (1520) resonance with spin 3/2, the maximum rank would increase to N r = 4. It is worth noting that Eqs. (171) and (172) define only the maximum rank of the spin-density matrix. Depending on the scattering process and the data sample, a lower rank might be sufficient to describe the data. For example, diffractive scattering of spinless beam particles off nucleons is dominated by spin-non-flip processes [22,124]. Hence for these processes, a rank-1 spindensity matrix yields in most cases a satisfactory description of the data, in particular if other sources for incoherence such as target excitations or integration over large t intervals are avoided. A different approach that is studied at the VES experiment is to use a spin-density matrix with maximum rank and then to analyze the transition amplitudes that correspond to the largest eigenvalue of the spin-density matrix [125]. The rank considerations for photo-and leptoproduction are discussed in Ref. [118]. If multiple production mechanisms contribute to the analyzed process, Eqs.

A convenient way of incorporating parity conservation into the PWA model in Eq. 170is to consider the scattering subprocess a + b \u2192 X + c in the so-called reflectivity basis [123]. We choose the coordinate system that we use to describe the quantum spin states of the particles such that the quantization axis (z axis) lies in the production plane. A possible choice for such a quantization axis is the beam axis, like it is used in the definition of the Gottfried-Jackson frame in Section 5.1.4. If the process a + b \u2192 X + c is parity conserving, the scattering amplitude is invariant under space inversion. Such a parity transformation flips the direction of all particle momenta. Since the four particles lie in the production plane, this can be undone by performing, in addition to the space inversion, a rotation by 180 \u2022 about the production plane normal, which is taken as the y axis. The combined transformation is represented by the reflectivity operator\u03a0 y and corresponds to a reflection through the production plane, which leaves the momenta of those particles that lie in that plane unchanged.

(13)) of the exchange particle in the scattering process [128][129][130]. Note that this relation is only valid for spinless beam particles and unpolarized target and recoil particles. For beam particles with spin, Eqs. (174) and (175) have to be extended to also take into account the spin state of the beam particle. For the case of photoproduction, this has been worked out in Ref. [130]. Depending on the scattering process, amplitudes with certain \u03b7 ex values may be suppressed. Since \u03b5 \u2261 \u03b7 ex , the corresponding partial-wave amplitudes are also suppressed.

However, L is in general not the probability density function of \u03b8 for given x. In other words, maximizing the probability to observe the data with respect to \u03b8, as expressed in Eq.

Another advantage of the maximum likelihood method is that Eq. (199) does not require any binning of the data. Therefore, the method is applicable also to high-dimensional data, where binned approaches quickly becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources. 69 If the number N of data points is not predetermined but is a result of the measurement and therefore a random variable, the maximum likelihood principle can be extended. In the case of counting experiments, events are produced randomly in time with constant average rates and hence the number of produced events follows the Poisson distribution with the expected number of events \u03bb.

Since the transition amplitudes are independent of \u03c4 n , they can be pulled out of the normalization integral in Eq. (206). In Eq. 208, this leads to an integral matrix acc I \u03b5 ij that is similar to the integral matrix I \u03b5 ij in Eq. (187). The only differences between the two matrices are that in acc I \u03b5 ij the normalized decay amplitudes appear in the integrand (see Eq. (190)) and that the integration is performed over the accepted phase space. As was discussed in Section 5.1, the decay amplitudes do not contain any free parameters. We can therefore calculate the decay amplitudes as well as the integral matrices I \u03b5 ij and acc I \u03b5 ij using Monte Carlo integration techniques before maximizing the likelihood function. This is described in Appendix G. Since the integral matrices are computationally very expensive, this reduces the time to compute the likelihood function by several orders of magnitude. It is only due to this fact that the maximization procedure becomes actually feasible in terms of computational resources. However, allowing no free parameters in the decay amplitudes is a severe limitation. This means in particular that the dynamical amplitudes of all isobar resonances in the PWA model have to be known. In many analyses, this becomes an important source of systematic uncertainties. This issue will be discussed further in Section 5.2.8. In Section 5.2.9, we will present a novel method that circumvents most of these issues.",

One starts again with Monte Carlo events that are uniformly distributed in the n-body phase-space but one skips step (ii), i.e. one does not weight the events with the acceptance. Based on these pseudo data one can perform PWA fits with the same or altered PWA models 78 in order to study, for example, the distinguishability of certain partial-wave amplitudes. If the acceptance is very non-uniform in any of the kinematic variables that enter the PWA model or if detector resolution effects in any of these variables are large, the distinguishability of certain partial-wave amplitudes might be degraded. 79 Such degradations can be studied using a similar procedure as above, where the phase-space events are weighted with the acceptance and the acceptance correction is applied in the likelihood function as for real data. 77 To save computation time, one can reuse the Monte Carlo data sample that was generated to calculate the integral matrix acc I \u03b5 ij in Eq.

Even though the production of intermediate states is expected to be suppressed with increasing spin, there is no clear cut-off. Also irreducible and interfering contributions from non-resonant processes are often contained in the data. For t-channel exchange processes, the largest non-resonant contributions come from double-Regge exchange processes (see Section 4.1). Figure 35 shows two examples for such processes in \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + production. Since in these processes, no 3\u03c0 intermediate states with well-defined quantum numbers appear, the non-resonant contributions typically project into all partial waves. Some high-spin partial waves are even dominated by non-resonant contributions. Such waves are important in order to describe the data but are uninteresting when it comes to extracting resonances. So, in order to estimate the transition amplitudes from the data as was described in Section 5.2.5, one also needs to determine the set {i} of partial waves that enters in Eq. (197) from the data. The analysis problem hence turns into a more difficult model-selection problem, which is complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the correlations of the partial-wave amplitudes due to their mutual interference.",

Although signals in the invariant mass distributions of the respective subsystems of the final-state particles help to identify the contributing isobars (see e.g. Fig. 42 in Section 6.2.3), this information is in some cases not enough to unambiguously identify all isobars. 80 As was explained in Section 5.2.5, the decay amplitudes must not have any free parameters because otherwise the computation of the likelihood function becomes very expensive. Thus we do not only have to decide which isobar resonances to include in the PWA model but also which parameterizations and resonance parameters describe them best. The model building hence requires input from other measurements. In most cases, the dynamical amplitudes of the isobar resonances are approximated by Breit-Wigner amplitudes as in Eqs. (153) and (154) and the PDG world averages are used for the resonance parameters. However, for some isobar resonances, the parameters are not precisely known and/or it is unclear which parameterization to use for their dynamical amplitude. For example, the isoscalar resonances with J P C = 0 ++ quantum numbers, i.e. the f 0 states, that appear in \u03c0\u03c0 and KK subsystems are notoriously difficult to describe (see e.g. Ref. [143]). For high-precision data, the issue is exacerbated by possible effects from final-state interactions, which may distort the effective dynamical amplitudes of the isobar resonances (see e.g. Refs. [61,144]). The restriction of the conventional PWA approach to parameter-free decay amplitudes makes it difficult to implement and test models that take into account such effects. A crude way of checking, whether the used parameters of the isobar resonances deviate from the data, are so-called likelihood scans. Here, one performs several PWA fits with different values for selected isobar parameters and compares the maximum values of the likelihood function for each parameter set. Using the asymptotic normality of the maximum of the likelihood function in the resonance parameters, one can estimate isobar parameters that better fit the data (see e.g. Ref. [145]). However, with this method one can optimize only a few free parameters simultaneously. A more model-independent approach that is able to extract the amplitudes of subsystems with well-defined quantum numbers from the data will be presented in Section 5.2.9.",

For orthogonal decay amplitudes, the corresponding off-diagonal elements of the phase-space integral matrix I \u03b5 ij in Eq. (187) vanish.

This matrix is actually a Gram matrix for the scalar product of two partial-wave amplitudes that is represented by the phase space integral in Eq. (187). A modulus of 1 of an offdiagonal element of norm I \u03b5 ij would mean that the corresponding partial-wave amplitudes are mathematically indistinguishable, i.e. linearly dependent. A PWA model containing such a pair of waves would be ill-defined and would lead to unphysical fit results for these waves. In practice, due to the finiteness of the measured data set, such distinguishability issues may already arise for waves, for which | norm I \u03b5 ij | is close to unity. This is usually the case for wave sets that include in addition to the ground-state isobar resonances also the corresponding radially excited states. At low m X , i.e. well below thresholds that correspond to the nominal masses of an isobar and its radial excitation, the dynamical amplitudes of the two isobar resonances are dominated by phase space and are hence very similar. In this case, the elements of norm I \u03b5 ij that correspond to waves with the same quantum numbers have large moduli. This is a general problem that always appears when an isobar and its radial excitation are included in the PWA model as separate partial-wave amplitudes. It is a consequence of the binning in m X . In order to resolve the arising ambiguities, one usually makes the PWA model discontinuous in m X , i.e. one introduces m X thresholds, below which certain waves are excluded from the PWA model. In practice, one would hence exclude waves with radially excited isobars at low masses. This means that we have to determine the wave set in principle for each m X bin individually. 81 This also takes into account the different size of the data samples in the various m X bins.",

[146] propose to apply information criteria [151,152] to determine the optimal parameter values, but more studies are needed to verify the applicability of these criteria. Currently, the regularization of the likelihood function seems to be an interesting approach that is worth to be studied in more detail. The method would make the wave-set selection reproducible and the bias that is introduced in form of the regularization term explicit. By applying different regularization terms and parameter values, one could study the wave-set dependence of the PWA result. The method makes it also possible to study, for example, the dependence of the PWA result on the set of isobars, on the parameterizations of the dynamical amplitudes of the isobar resonances, and on the inclusion of partial waves with higher spin. In most cases, such studies are impossible to perform if the waves set is selected by hand.",

The disadvantage of this approach is that the extracted partial-wave amplitudes have a complicated transformation behavior under Lorentz transformations and-more importantly-do no satisfy all constraints required by analyticity. An alternative approach is to formulate the decay amplitudes in a covariant formalism [153][154][155][156][157][158][159], often referred to as covariant tensor formalism. In a recent comparison of both approaches, the authors of Ref. [160], however, find that some of the covariant approaches violate crossing symmetry.

Consequently, the choice of the parameterizations and parameters of the dynamical amplitudes of the isobar resonances induces significant systematic uncertainties that are difficult to estimate. In addition, in the conventional PWA approach it is difficult to take into account decays via ground and excited states of isobar resonances. Partial-wave amplitudes that have the same angular quantum numbers but describe decays via isobars with the same I G J P C quantum numbers are non-orthogonal because of the non-vanishing overlaps of the dynamic amplitudes of the isobar states. As was discussed in Section 5.2.8, the non-orthogonality may lead to distinguishability issues between these partial-wave amplitudes. Hence yields of resonances can only be measured reliably from the coherent sum of these amplitudes. A notoriously difficult case, where both aspects-not well-known parameterizations and several excited states-come together, is, for example, the sector of isoscalar scalar isobars. Decays via such isobars may involve the f 0 (500), f 0 (980), f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500), or even higher-lying states. In order to circumvent these limitations and in addition render the analysis less model-dependent, members of the COMPASS analysis group developed the novel so-called freed-isobar PWA method. This method is inspired by the so-called model-independent PWA method that was developed by the authors of Ref. [161] in order to study three-body decays of heavy mesons. Here, we briefly sketch the freed-isobar method for the case of three spinless final-state particles as was discussed in Section 5.1.5. More details can be found in Refs. [110,162,163]. The extension of the method to final states with more particles is straight forward. Without loss of generality, we assume that the three-body decay proceeds via the two-step process X \u2192 r +3 with r \u2192 1 + 2. We assume in addition a rank-1 spin-density matrix.",

(226), the additional coherent sum over the m r bin index l appears in the same way as the sum over the partial-wave index i. Therefore, each m r mass bin can be treated like an independent partial wave. By defining a new freed-isobar partial-wave index i := {i, l}, Eq. (226) becomes mathematically equivalent to Eq. (197). This means that exactly the same maximum likelihood fit procedure as was described in Section 5.2.5 can be employed to determine the T \u03b5 i,l . This also includes the pre-calculation of the integral matrices of the decay amplitudes. It is actually this property of the freed-isobar approach that makes it practically applicable, in contrast to allowing free parameters in the dynamical isobar amplitudes, which is usually prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources. Another important property of the freed-isobar approach is that not all waves in the PWA model have to be parameterized using the freedisobar amplitudes in Eq. (222). Depending on the size of the analyzed data sample, one usually employs freed-isobar amplitudes only for a subset of waves while for the remaining waves in the PWA model the conventional fixed parameterizations of the isobar amplitudes are used. Depending on how many decay amplitudes are parameterized using freed-isobar amplitudes and how many m r bins are used for the freedisobar amplitudes, the computation cost for a freed-isobar PWA grows only moderately, typically by about an order of magnitude.",

As is clear from Eq. 225, the freed-isobar transition amplitudes contain information about the intermediate states X as well as about the respective isobar subsystems. For each freed-isobar wave and each (m X , t ) cell, the method yields an Argand diagram ranging in m r from m 1 + m 2 to m X \u2212 m 3 . It is important to note that by parameterizing the m r dependence of the decay amplitude for a wave i using the freed-isobar amplitude in Eq. 222, we do not make any assumptions about the resonance content of the (1, 2) subsystem. The freed-isobar PWA determines from the data the total amplitude of all intermediate isobar states with given I G J P C quantum numbers in the three-body partial wave defined by i and \u03b5. This amplitude T \u03b5 i hence includes all isobar resonances, potential non-resonant contributions, as well as possible distortions due to final-state interactions. As a consequence, the method avoids the issue of non-orthogonal partial-wave amplitudes for decays via isobar states with the same I G J P C quantum numbers that appear in the conventional PWA as was discussed above. The reduced model dependence of the freed-isobar method and the obtained additional information about the correlation of the dynamic isobar amplitude with the dynamic amplitude of the X come at the price of a considerably larger number of fit parameters compared to the conventional PWA. Thus even for large data sets, the freed-isobar approach can only be applied to a subset of the partial waves in the PWA model.

This set of spin-density matrices serves as the input for the second analysis stage, where we want to identify n-body resonances that contribute to certain partial-wave amplitudes and determine their parameters. To this end, we formulate a model \u03b5 ij (m X , t ) 87 that describes the dependence of the spin-density matrix elements on m X and t in terms of resonant and non-resonant components. The parameters and yields of the resonances included in this model are determined by a fit to the measured spin-density matrices. In this resonance-model fit, which is also referred to as mass-dependent fit, we exploit that resonances have a characteristic signature. In the simplest case, they appear as Breit-Wigner-shaped peaks in the partial-wave intensities that are accompanied by 180 \u2022 phase motions relative to non-resonating waves (see e.g. Fig. 10). In reality, this simple picture often does not hold. The behavior of the spin-density matrix elements is usually more complicated because multiple resonances, e.g. a ground state and corresponding radially excited states, may appear in a given partial wave. In general, the resonances overlap and interfere so that resonance peaks might shift, disappear, or-in the case of destructive interference-might even turn into dips in the intensity distribution. 88 In diffractivedissociation reactions, this interference pattern is further complicated by additional coherent contributions from non-resonant double-Regge exchange processes (see Sections 4.1 and 5.2.8 and Figs. 21c and 21d). The different t dependences of these contributions lead to a t -dependent interference. Hence in many cases, the information from partial-wave intensities alone is insufficient to extract resonances and their parameters reliably from the data. It is therefore a great advantage that the partial-wave decomposition is performed at the amplitude level. The parameters of the resonances are hence constrained not only by the measured intensities of the partial waves but also by the mutual interference terms of the waves. This greatly improves the sensitivity for potential resonance signals.",

            "text": "As was discussed in Section 5.1.7, an advantage of the two-stage analysis approach is that the resonance model does not need to describe all partial-wave amplitudes that are included in the PWA model. The representation of the data in terms of the spin-density matrix allows us to model only selected matrix elements. Usually, one selects a subset of waves and models all elements of the corresponding spin-density submatrix. The criteria that are used to select the waves that are included in the resonance-model fit depend strongly on the analyzed channel. In general, one tries to select waves with clear signals of known resonances plus a few \"interesting\" waves, the idea being that the known resonances act as reference amplitudes, against which the resonant amplitudes in the interesting waves can interfere. When searching for resonance signals in the partial-wave amplitudes, one has to take into account that similar to the resonance peaks in the intensity distributions also the phase motions are distorted by the presence of other resonances. If, for example, waves i and j with reflectivity \u03b5 each contain a resonance, the rising motion of their relative phase \u2206\u03c6 \u03b5 ij (see Eq. (214)) due to the resonance in wave i may be compensated by the falling motion due to the other resonance in wave j. In the extreme case when the two resonances have similar parameters, this cancellation may become nearly complete. It is therefore often difficult to observe undisturbed phase motions of resonances. This effect is particularly pronounced in the high-m X regions, where broad excited states appear in most or even all waves in the resonance-model fit.",

Hence the sum in Eq. (228) runs over the set S \u03b5 i of those wave components that we assume to appear in wave i with reflectivity \u03b5. The dynamical amplitudes depend on a set of shape parameters that we denote by \u03b6 r\u03b5 k . For example, in the case of a Breit-Wigner resonance, these parameters are mass and width of that resonance. It is important to note that for resonances the dynamical amplitudes and their shape parameters are independent of the partial-wave index i, the rank index r, and the reflectivity \u03b5. Thus if a resonance component D R k appears in several partial waves, which e.g. represent different decay chains or M \u03b5 states of this resonance, the same shape parameters \u03b6 R k are used in these waves. The coupling amplitudes C r\u03b5 ki (t ) in Eq.

Currently, theoretical models are not detailed enough in order to parameterize these t dependences. Therefore, binned approximations of the C r\u03b5 ki (t ) are extracted from the data by fitting the resonance model to all t bins simultaneously and leaving the values of each coupling amplitude in each t bin as free parameters to be determined by the fit. The resonance model hence parameterizes mostly the m X dependence of the spin-density matrix, but is model-independent with respect to the t dependence in the sense that the amplitude of each component in each wave is allowed to have a different t dependence. An additional advantage of this binned approach is that the resonant and non-resonant wave components can be better disentangled because their amplitudes have usually different dependences on t . The caveat of such a t -resolved resonance-model fit is the large number of free parameters.",

In the limit of \u03b1 0 = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 (GeV/c) \u22122 , this probability is proportional to 1/x P and hence proportional to 1/m 2 X . This dependence can be explained, for example, by a Bremsstrahlungs-like mechanism [169,170]. We assume that the Pomeron flux factor in Eq. (232) is universal and apply it to the single-Pomeron exchange process of diffractive dissociation as it was done e.g. in Ref. [171].

The sum in Eq. (242) runs over all t bins and those m X bins that lie within the chosen fit ranges. For the off-diagonal interference terms \u039b \u03b5 ij , the m X range is given by the intersection of the fit ranges for the intensities of waves i and j. The best estimate for the model parameters is determined by minimizing the \u03c7 2 function using the MIGRAD algorithm of the MINUIT package [175,176]. 93 It is important to note that although we use the notation \u03c7 2 for the minimized quantity in Eq. 242, the minimum \u03c7 2 does in general not follow a \u03c7 2 distribution. This means that the expectation value of the minimum is not the number of degrees of freedom (n.d.f.). Also the deviation of the minimum from the n.d.f. is not directly interpretable as an absolute measure for the goodness of the fit. This is because we assume in Eq. (242) that the elements of \u039b \u03b5 ij (m X , t ) are all statistically independent. Although this assumption is true for matrix elements from different m X or t bins, it is in general not true for matrix elements within a given (m X , t ) cell. They could be correlated due to statistical correlations of the transition amplitudes in the PWA fit. In principle, these correlations are known because in the partial-wave decomposition that is performed in the first analysis stage also the covariance matrix of the transition amplitudes T r\u03b5 i (m X , t ) is estimated (see Eq. (F.4)). However, the propagation of this information to the covariance matrix of the elements of \u039b \u03b5 ij is not well defined. This is because the spin-density matrix has more free real-valued parameters than the set of transition amplitudes. In an (m X , t ) cell, the resonance-model fit minimizes the distance of the model to  94 For a rank-1 spin density matrix, this actually leads to analytical relations among the spin-density matrix elements of waves i, j, k, and l of the form",

In general, the employed Breit-Wigner amplitudes are good approximations only for isolated resonances far above the kinematical thresholds of their decay modes. In addition, using a sum of Breit-Wigner amplitudes to describe the total amplitude of a set of resonances with the same quantum numbers is a good approximation only if the resonances are well-separated so that they have little overlap. Otherwise unitarity, i.e. the conservation of probability, may be violated. For resonances with multiple decay modes, Breit-Wigner parameterizations do also neglect coupled-channel effects caused by unitarity constraints. These effects may become large when the kinematical thresholds of one or more of these decays 93 For high-precision data, the resonance model usually is not able to reproduce all details of the data. The residual deviations of the model from the data often induce a multi-modal behavior of the minimization. Reference [165] discusses strategies on how to resolve this multi-modality in order to obtain the best physical solution. 94 Only in the case of maximum rank, i.e. for N \u03b5 r = N \u03b5 waves , the set of transition amplitudes has the same number of real-valued parameters as \u039b \u03b5 ij . 95 For the case of a rank-1 spin-density matrix, Appendix C in Ref.

Another potential weakness of our model is the decomposition of the partial-wave amplitudes into a sum of resonant and non-resonant components, which is not unique [52] and hence introduces additional process and model dependence of the resonance parameters. In principle, this decomposition would be constrained by unitarity, which is, however, not taken into account here. Due to the absence of realistic models, the parameterizations employed for the non-resonant wave components (see Eqs. (230) and 231) are only phenomenological. Also, the model assumption that the phase of the non-resonant amplitudes is independent of m X may not be well justified especially for cases where these amplitudes exhibit pronounced peaks in their intensity distribution. Although the parameters of the non-resonant components are in principle nuisance parameters, the choice of their parameterizations turns out to be one of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty.",

The results can also be compared directly to previous analyses of diffractive meson production that employed similar models. Some of the potential issues mentioned above are expected to be mitigated by our approach of simultaneously fitting multiple t bins while forcing the resonance parameters to be the same across all t bins. This puts strong constraints on the resonant and non-resonant wave components. Additional constraints that help to reduce systematic effects come from including as many decay chains of a resonance as possible into the resonance-model fit and requiring the same resonance parameters in these decay chains. Fitting a large spin-density submatrix with many waves with well-defined resonance signals has a similar effect because the resonance-model fit takes into account the whole spindensity submatrix with all its interference terms. The number of these interference terms grows with the number of selected waves squared. Thus the statistic in Eq. (242) that is employed to estimate the fit parameters effectively gives more weight to the interference terms than to the intensities. In practice, this often helps to stabilize the fit as the model reproduces the phase motions usually more accurately than the intensities.",

            "text": "based fit models discussed in Section 5.3 to analytic models constrained by unitarity, which allows the extraction of resonance pole positions. In this section, we will briefly sketch the model which was successfully applied to the \u03b7\u03c0 and \u03b7 \u03c0 COMPASS data. The fit results and the extracted pole positions for the \u03c0 1 (1600), a 2 (1320), and a 2 (1700) [70,71] will be summarized in Sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.4. As discussed in Section 4.1, the diffractive production of the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 final state proceeds dominantly via Pomeron (P) exchange (see Fig. 36a). In Section 3.2, we have shown that the concept of Pomeron exchange emerges from Regge theory, which allows us to factorize the p-P vertex from the \u03c0-P vertex. In the model, we hence only consider the process \u03c0 + P \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0, which we describe (cf. Section 3.1.10) by 2 \u2192 2 partial-wave production amplitudes a J,i (s), with i = {\u03b7\u03c0, \u03b7 \u03c0}, J the angular momentum of the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 system, and s the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 mass squared. Note that this notation of invariants differs from the one introduced in Section 5.1. In principle, the amplitudes a J,i also depend on the Pomeron helicity and virtuality t. Due to the steeply falling t spectrum in the analyzed range from 0.1 to 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 , we use an effective value t eff = 0.1 (GeV/c) 2 . The Pomeron is modelled as an effective exchange particle with spin 1, in accordance with the dominance of M = 1 partial waves in the data and the approximate constancy of hadron cross sections at high energies (cf. Fig. 5 and Section 3.2).",

For the D wave, two poles in the K-matrix for D J,0,ij (s) are needed to describe the data. These poles correspond to the a 2 (1320) and the a 2 (1700).

[110,190] and Section 4.2.8), we obtain 420 000 exclusive events for the solid-lead target and 46 \u2022 10 6 exclusive events for the liquid-hydrogen target in the analyzed three-pion mass range 0.5 < m 3\u03c0 < 2.5 GeV/c 2 . For the lead-target data, the target recoil was not measured so that the contribution of nonexclusive backgrounds is larger in this sample. In the analyzed range 0.1 < t < 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 , the scattering off the lead nucleus is predominantly of incoherent nature, i.e. the beam pions scatter off individual nucleons within the lead nucleus. Thus the lead-target data are expected to be similar to the proton-target data. Figure 38 shows the m 3\u03c0 distributions for the two data samples. They exhibit pronounced structures that correspond to the well known resonances a 1 (1260), a 2 (1320), and \u03c0 2 (1670) (see Sections 6.3.2, 6.3.4, and 6.3.5).

The parity P of the state is given by (\u22121) L . Therefore, only states with positive naturality (see Section 2.1.1) are accessible. In diffractive reactions, the isospin I and the C parity of X are given by the isospin and C parity of the beam particle, i.e. I = 1 and C = +1 for a pion beam. This means that partial waves with odd L correspond to spin-exotic quantum numbers. In the reflectivity basis (see Section 5.2.3), the combination M \u03b5 = 0 + of the spin-projection quantum number M and the reflectivity \u03b5 is forbidden for natural-parity states. Thus J P C = 0 ++ waves, which may contain a 0 resonances, may only appear with M \u03b5 = 0 \u2212 quantum numbers that correspond to unnatural-parity exchange. At high beam energies, Pomeron exchange dominates and unnatural-parity exchange processes are suppressed. Therefore, M \u03b5 = 1 + waves are expected to dominate and \u03b5 = \u22121 waves should be suppressed. Often, the spectroscopic notation LM \u03b5 is used to designate twopseudoscalar partial waves. E.g., partial waves with J P C M \u03b5 = 0 ++ 0 \u2212 , 1 \u2212+ 0 \u2212 , 1 \u2212+ 1 \u2212 , 1 \u2212+ 1 + , and 2 ++ 2 + quantum numbers correspond to S0 \u2212 , P 0 \u2212 , P 1 \u2212 , P 1 + , and D2 + , respectively.",

In the 1.3 GeV/c 2 mass region of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data, the cos \u03d1 GJ distribution exhibits a two-bump structure that is characteristic for a D wave. This is consistent with the dominant a 2 (1320) signal (see also Fig. 37a). In contrast, the modulation of the angular distribution is weaker in the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data as is the a 2 (1320) signal. In the 2 GeV/c 2 mass region of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data, the cos \u03d1 GJ distribution exhibits four bumps, which indicates the presence of a G wave. This structure is disentangled by the PWA and explained as the a 4 (2040) (see Section 6.3.6). Again, this structure is much weaker in the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data. For masses above 2 GeV/c 2 the character of the cos \u03d1 GJ distributions changes drastically. For both final states, the distributions show narrow peaks at cos \u03d1 GJ = \u00b11, which correspond to \u03b7 ( ) going along the beam direction in the Gottfried-Jackson frame, i.e. forward, or against it, i.e. backward. The peaks become sharper with increasing mass. This behavior corresponds to a rapidity gap that widens with increasing mass and indicates the presence of large contributions from non-resonant processes. Clearly, high-spin partial waves are needed to describe such cos \u03d1 GJ distributions. The non-resonant processes are dominated by double-Regge exchanges (see Sections 4.1 and 5.2.8 and Figs. 21c and 21d). Figure 41 shows possible double-Regge exchange diagrams for the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 final state. These processes are similar to the well-known non-resonant Deck process in diffractive 3\u03c0 production [100,198] and to central production of \u03b7 ( ) in pp collisions as, for example, observed by the WA102 experiment [199]. These irreducible background processes typically have one leading final-state particle. For a two-body final state, this means that the other final-state particle is relatively slow, leading to forward-backward peaks in the cos \u03d1 GJ distribution that become sharper with increasing mass of the two-body system.",

This asymmetry is not caused by detector effects. In the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data, the backward excess is more pronounced over the whole mass range. Since even-L waves have only symmetric cos \u03d1 GJ distributions, the forward-backward asymmetry indicates the presence of spin-exotic odd-L waves, predominantly those with lowest possible L, i.e. P waves. In case of \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 , contributions of odd-L partial waves that are comparable in strength to those of the even-L partial  waves are needed in order to describe the backward enhancement. In the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data, the cos \u03d1 GJ asymmetry flips from a backward \u03b7 excess at high masses to a forward excess in the a 2 (1320) mass region. In the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data, this effect is partly masked by the broad enhancement around 1.6 GeV/c 2 that is caused by the P wave, which is much stronger in the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 channel as compared to \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 . The PWA model used for the partial-wave decomposition is based on Eq. (197). The two-body decay amplitudes \u03a8 \u03b5 LM (\u03d1 GJ , \u03c6 GJ ) in the reflectivity basis are given by Eqs. (158), (164), (177), and (190). In order to account for non-\u03b7 ( ) incoherent backgrounds, we extend the two-body PWA model to a four-body model for the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + (\u03b3\u03b3) system, where the (\u03b3\u03b3) subsystem is either a \u03c0 0 in case of \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 or an \u03b7 in case of \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 . Instead of selecting a narrow \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3\u03b3 mass window around the nominal \u03b7 ( ) mass, the analysis is performed requiring at least one \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3\u03b3 combination inside a wide m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3\u03b3 interval of \u00b125 MeV/c 2 around the nominal \u03b7 ( ) mass. In order to take into account the three-body decay of \u03b7 ( ) , we extend the two-body decay amplitudes that are given by the spherical harmonics by a factor f \u03b7 ( ) that describes the measured \u03b7 ( ) peak shape and the Dalitz-plot distribution of the three-body \u03b7 ( ) decay. 96 The latter was 96 The angular-momentum barrier factor F J (m \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 ) in Eq. (158) depends in principle also on the reconstructed \u03b7 ( ) mass via the breakup momentum that appears in Eq. (97). However, since the width of the \u03b7 ( ) mass peak is given by the detector resolution, the barrier factor is set to a constant for a given m",

From Eq. (249) it now clear, that the above-mentioned observed sin 2 \u03c6 GJ distribution is in agreement with the dominance of M \u03b5 = 1 + waves. The decay amplitude \u03a8 flat (\u03c4 4 ) of the flat wave (see Section 5.2.1) is isotropic in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + (\u03b3\u03b3) fourbody phase space. It hence absorbs the incoherent non-\u03b7 ( ) backgrounds. We account for the combinatorial background due to the two possible \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3\u03b3 combinations by summing the total intensities that correspond to the two combinations in the PWA model. 97 Most previous partial-wave analyses used PWA models that contained waves only up to L = 2, except the one in Ref. [195] where in addition a L = 4 wave was introduced. The PWA model for the COMPASS data contains all positive-reflectivity waves with L = 1 to 6 and M = 1. For the \u03b7\u03c0 data, we include in addition a wave with L = 2 and M \u03b5 = 2 + . We also include the L = 0 wave with M \u03b5 = 0 \u2212 for both channels. Since this is the only negative-reflectivity wave in the model, its amplitude is added incoherently to the intensity. Our four-body PWA approach is able to separate the incoherent non-\u03b7 ( ) backgrounds, which are absorbed by the flat wave, from the incoherent negative-reflectivity \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 contributions. The PWA fits require only a weak S-wave amplitude with \u03b5 = \u22121. This wave contributes 0.5 % to the total \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 intensity and 1.1 % to the total \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 intensity and contains mainly incoherent \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 background.",

It is known that the spin-density matrix elements may have significantly different t dependences as is, for example, the case for the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data.

            "text": "To construct the wave set, we first have to determine the set of two-pion isobar resonances that appear in the data and we have to choose the parameterizations for their propagator terms (see Section 5.1.3). Since there are no known resonances in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 channel, which has I = 2 and is thus flavor-exotic, we consider only \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + isobar resonances. From the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + mass spectrum in Fig. 42a and from Dalitz plots like the one in Fig. 42b, we can already infer that we have to include \u03c1(770), f 0 (980), and f 2 (1270) as isobars. The slight enhancement at about m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + = 1.7 GeV/c 2 in Fig. 42a could be due to \u03c1 3 (1690), \u03c1(1700), or f 0 (1710). In our PWA model, we include only the \u03c1 3 (1690), which is known from previous experiments (see e.g. Ref. [210]) to appear in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + subsystem of diffractively produced 3\u03c0 final states. Due to ambiguities of the partial-wave amplitudes that may arise when the PWA model contains radially excited isobar resonances (see Section 5.2.8), we include neither the \u03c1(1700) nor the f 0 (1710). We confirm that the f 0 (1710) does not contribute significantly to the data by performing a co-called freed-isobar PWA (see Section 5.2.9), the results of which are described in more detail below. For the proton-target data, we include one wave with the f 0 (1500) isobar in the range m 3\u03c0 > 1.7 GeV/c 2 . The PWA model for both \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data samples contains in addition the f 0 (500), which is also known as \u03c3. Ignoring possible contributions from excited \u03c1 and f 2 states and from isobar states with J > 3, we arrive at sets of 6 and 5 isobars that we include in the PWA models for the proton-and lead-target data, respectively. The \u03c1(770), f 2 (1270), f 0 (1500), and \u03c1 3 (1690) are described using relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitudes (see Section 5.1.3 and Section IV.A in Ref. [110] for details). The description of the f 0 (500) and f 0 (980) isobars is more difficult. The distortion of the f 0 (980) line shape due to its closeness to the KK threshold is taken into account by using a Flatt\u00e9 parameterization [66,212,213]. The f 0 (500) is extremely broad and is thus not well described by a Breit-Wigner amplitude. We describe this state effectively by a parameterization of the amplitude of the S wave in \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and KK scattering [214] modified to separate out the f 0 (980) (see Section IV.A in Ref. [110] for details). In the text below, we denote this isobar amplitude by [\u03c0\u03c0] S .",

From the result of a PWA performed using this wave set, we have derived a smaller wave set by eliminating structureless waves with relative intensities below approximately 10 \u22123 in an iterative process [215]. This yields a final set of 88 partial waves, which consists of 80 waves with reflectivity \u03b5 = +1, seven waves with \u03b5 = \u22121 and one non-interfering flat wave representing three uncorrelated pions. This is the largest wave set that was used so far in an analysis of diffractively produced 3\u03c0. In order to avoid ambiguities between partial-wave amplitudes (see Section 5.2.8), we have to exclude 27 waves in the low-m 3\u03c0 region. The corresponding m 3\u03c0 thresholds were carefully tuned for each wave and are given in Table IX in Appendix A of Ref. [110]. In order to illustrate the fit result, we show in Fig. 43 the intensities of sums of positive-reflectivity amplitudes that have the same J P C quantum numbers. Note that the composition of the data in terms of J P C changes substantially with t , in particular for the 1 ++ and 2 ++ waves. For the less precise lead-target data, a smaller PWA model with only 42 waves is used [190], which is a subset of the 88-wave set.",

(252) to the extracted partial-wave intensities. This approach assumes that the shapes of the t spectra of the partial waves are largely independent of m 3\u03c0 and also does not take into account possible t dependences of the relative phases between the partial waves. The much larger proton-target data sample allows us to perform the PWA using a two-dimensional binning with 100 m 3\u03c0 bins with 20 MeV/c 2 width and 11 non-equidistant t bins, where the t bins are chosen to contain approximately equal number of events. For each of the resulting 1100 (m 3\u03c0 , t ) cells, an independent PWA fit is performed using the 88-wave PWA model (see Section 5.2). Because of the binning in t , we do not have to assume any model for the t dependences of the partial-wave amplitudes but instead extract this information from the data. This t -binned analysis reveals a complicated m 3\u03c0 dependence of the t spectra. For many waves, the t spectra are not well described by a single exponential and the slope parameters differ significantly between waves and also between different m 3\u03c0 regions in the same wave. Hence the model in Eqs. (251) and (252) that is used in the analysis of the lead-target data may not be sufficient to describe all features of the data.",

The freed-isobar amplitudes contain the total 0 ++ isobar amplitudes including all resonant and non-resonant components for the given 3\u03c0 quantum numbers and the analyzed (m 3\u03c0 , t ) cell and are model-independent with respect to the parameterizations of the 0 ++ isobars. Due to the much larger number of fit parameters, the freed-isobar PWA is performed using only 50 bins in m 3\u03c0 and 4 bins in t . The results of the conventional and the freed-isobar PWA are qualitatively in agreement (see Section VI in Ref. [110]). This validates the fixed parameterizations of the 0 ++ isobars that are employed in the conventional PWA and shows that in the conventional PWA waves decaying into [\u03c0\u03c0] S \u03c0 and f 0 (980)\u03c0 can be well separated.",

            "text": "The selected sets of 6 and 14 waves contain signals of the well-known 3\u03c0 resonances a 1 (1260), a 2 (1320), \u03c0 2 (1670), \u03c0(1800), and a 4 (2040), which appear as peaks in the respective partial-wave intensities and as phase motions in the relative phases of these waves. The 14-wave set includes in addition waves with signals for the well-known \u03c0 2 (1880). This set also includes a clear resonance-like signal of the novel a 1 (1420), which was discovered in an earlier analysis of the same COMPASS proton-target data in Ref. [191]. This earlier analysis used the same 88-wave PWA fit result but the resonance-model fit included only three partial waves. The 14-wave set also contains signals of the less well-known states a 1 (1640) and a 2 (1700). It turns out that the proton-target data require a third \u03c0 2 resonance, the \u03c0 2 (2005), which according to the PDG requires confirmation [5]. For both data samples, the waves selected for the resonance-model fit include the spin-exotic 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave. The appearance of a potential \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance in this wave is disputed [210,211,216]. In total, the resonance model in Eq. (240) contains 6 resonances for the 6-wave fit of the lead-target data and 11 resonances for the 14-wave fit of the proton-target data. All resonances are described using Breit-Wigner amplitudes as in Eqs. (153) and (154). For the a 1 (1260) and the a 2 (1320), we use dynamic widths (see Section IV.A.1 in Ref. [165] for details). For the other resonances, we use constant widths as in Eq. (153). In addition to the resonant components, we include for each wave a separate coherent non-resonant component (see Section 5.3.1). The resonance models for the lead-and proton-target data are summarized in Table 3. For the lead-target data, the resonance model in Eq. (240) has rank 2 to match the rank of the spin-density matrix from the t -integrated PWA. The 14-wave resonance-model fit of the proton-target data is performed simultaneously in 11 t bins using a rank-1 resonance model. 102 Figure 44 shows the intensities of the resonant and non-resonant wave components from the 14-wave resonance-model fit of the proton-target data as a function of m 3\u03c0 (colored curves) together with the intensity of the coherent sum of the 14 selected partial-wave amplitudes (gray squares) and the total intensity of the PWA model (black points). Integrated over the analyzed m 3\u03c0 range, the coherent sum of the 14 selected partial-wave amplitudes contributes 57.9 % to the total intensity. This value is similar to the intensity sum of the 14 waves, which corresponds to 56.8 % of the total intensity. Thus the net effect of the interferences between the 14 partial-wave amplitudes is slightly constructive. It is worth noting that the intensities of  Table 3: Resonance models used to describe the elements of the spin-density matrix of selected partial waves, which are extracted from the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data, using Eq. (240). For the lead-target data, 6 waves (highlighted in blue) are selected and described using a resonance model containing 6 resonances (highlighted in blue) and a coherent non-resonant component for each wave [190]. For the proton-target data, the listed 14 waves are selected. They are described using a resonance model containing 11 resonances and a coherent non-resonant component for each wave [165].",

The largest contributions to the intensity come from the a 1 (1260) and the non-resonant term in the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave (continuous red curves in Figs. 44a and 44c). Since the resonance model contains only waves with positive reflectivity, all wave components, in particular the resonant and non-resonant components, do interfere. For waves with larger intensities, this interference is mostly constructive. Due to the highly precise proton-target data, the uncertainties of the resonance parameters from the 14-wave fit are completely dominated by systematic effects. The corresponding uncertainties are estimated based on extensive systematic studies. The parameters of the various resonances have vastly different systematic uncertainties. This mainly reflects two aspects of our data: (i) the large dynamic range of the intensities of the resonances in the selected waves as is illustrated in Figs. 44a and 44b and (ii) the vastly different strength of the non-resonant components relative to the resonances. As a consequence, we can determine the parameters of a 2 (1320), a 1 (1420), \u03c0 2 (1670), \u03c0(1800), and a 4 (2040) with high accuracy. In contrast, the parameters of a 1 (1260), \u03c0 1 (1600), a 1 (1640), and \u03c0 2 (2005) have relatively large systematic uncertainties.",

The Deck process [100] is a dominant source of non-resonant contributions (see Sections 4.1 and 5.2.8 and Fig. 35a). In order to study the dependence of our fit result on the parameterization of the non-resonant component, we performed a study, where the shapes of the nonresonant components are determined from a model for the Deck process (see Appendix B in Ref. [165] for details). Based on this model, we generate Monte Carlo pseudo-data and perform a PWA fit like for the real data using the 88-wave PWA model. The empirical parameterizations of the non-resonant components are then replaced by the square root of the intensity distributions as obtained from the partial-wave decomposition of the Deck Monte Carlo data. We will discuss the results from this study in Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 below. More details of the performed systematic studies are discussed in Section V and Appendix D in Ref. [165].  ",

The \u03c0(1300) was reported in \u03c1(770)\u03c0 and [\u03c0\u03c0] S \u03c0 decay modes, although the latter one is contradicted by a measurement by the Crystal Barrel Collaboration [217]. The \u03c0(1800) has a mass that is consistent with the second radial excitation of the pion, i.e. the 3 1 S 0 quark-model state, but it exhibits a peculiar decay pattern. The \u03c0(1800) decays mostly into 3\u03c0 and experiments have reported f 0 (500)\u03c0, f 0 (980)\u03c0, and f 0 (1370)\u03c0 decays, i.e. decays into J P C = 0 ++ isobars [5].

However, for both waves the shape of the intensity distribution around 1.3 GeV/c 2 changes strongly with t . This indicates large non-resonant contributions, which makes the determination of the resonance parameters difficult. This is probably one of the reasons, for the large spread of the \u03c0(1300) parameters as measured by previous experiments using similar reactions [5] and the resulting large uncertainty of the PDG estimate (see Table I.5). First attempts to describe the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 wave in the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data (see Fig. 45a) by a resonance model failed, because our model is not able to reproduce the observed intensity distribution. Improving the resonance model is the topic of future research.  The results of our analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data confirm the small branching of the \u03c0(1800) into \u03c1(770)\u03c0. The intensity distribution of the 0 \u2212+ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave in Fig. 45a exhibits only a small diplike structure in the 1.8 GeV/c 2 region, which could be due to the \u03c0(1800), but the spectrum is dominated by a broad peak around 1.4 GeV/c 2 . Consistent with previous experiments, we observe clear \u03c0(1800) peaks in the [\u03c0\u03c0] S \u03c0 and f 0 (980)\u03c0 waves (see Figs. 45b and 46a). However, contrary to the result of Ref. [210], we also observe a \u03c0(1800) peak in the f 0 (1500)\u03c0 wave (see Fig. 45c). The signal in this wave is about a factor 25 smaller than the one in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 wave and hence might have been undetectable in previous experiments.",

The m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution in the f 0 (1500) region, as shown in Fig. 47c, exhibits a clear \u03c0(1800) peak and is similar to the corresponding distribution from the conventional PWA with fixed parameterizations for the isobar resonances shown in Fig. 45c. These results show that also in the 3\u03c0 final state the \u03c0(1800) decays into f 0 (1500)\u03c0, as it is expected based on the observation of this decay mode in the \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 final state.",

            "text": "It is worth noting, that the Argand diagram in Fig. 47b shows no significant signal of a narrow f 0 (1370), 103 although f 0 (1370)\u03c0 was claimed as a 3\u03c0 decay mode of the \u03c0(1800) by previous experiments [184,218]. In addition, the VES experiment measured the branching-fraction ratio BF[\u03c0(1800) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0]/BF[\u03c0(1800) \u2192 f 0 (1370)\u03c0] = 1.7 \u00b1 1.3 [184]. A reason for this discrepancy could be the strong dependence of f 0 (500)\u03c0 and f 0 (1370)\u03c0 branching fractions on the PWA model, in particular on the parameterizations employed for the dynamical amplitudes of the overlapping 0 ++ isobars. Also in other m 3\u03c0 slices and for other J P C quantum numbers of the 3\u03c0 system (see e.g. Figs. 54e and 72e and Section VI in Ref. [110]), we do not observe significant signals of a narrow f 0 (1370) in the extracted isobar amplitudes. Our results from the freed-isobar PWA hence call into question the existence of the f 0 (1370) as a narrow \u03c0\u03c0 resonance. We find the cleanest \u03c0(1800) signal in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 wave, which is the only 0 \u2212+ wave included in the resonance-model fit. Figure 46a shows the intensity distribution of the 0 \u2212+ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 S wave in the lowest t bin. It exhibits a pronounced peak at 1.8 GeV/c 2 that is accompanied by a rapid phase motion (see Fig. 46b). Although all final-state particles in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 wave are in relative S waves, the amplitude of this wave is reliably extracted from the data and is found to be robust against changes of the PWA model. The resonance model (red curve) contains one resonance term for the \u03c0(1800) (blue curve) and one non-resonant term (green curve). From the fit, we obtain the Breit-Wigner parameters m \u03c0(1800) = 1804 +6 \u22129 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 \u03c0(1800) = 220 +8 \u221211 MeV/c 2 [165]. Our measurement of the \u03c0(1800) parameters is the so far most accurate and in good agreement with the PDG world average [5] as well as with our result of m \u03c0(1800) = 1785 \u00b1 9 (stat.) +12 \u22126 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 \u03c0(1800) = 208 \u00b1 22 (stat.) +21 \u221237 (sys.) MeV/c 2 from the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data [190]. The ideograms in Fig. 48 show that the measured \u03c0(1800) width values are in good agreement, whereas the mass values have a large spread and fall into two clusters centered at about 1780 MeV/c 2 and 1860 MeV/c 2 . Our new value from the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + protontarget data (top point in Fig. 48a) falls inbetween these two clusters. It is interesting to note that the measurement that has the largest discrepancy with respect to the weighted average of the \u03c0(1800) mass in Fig. 48a was obtained from a resonance-model fit of the 1.8 GeV/c 2 region of the 0 \u2212+ 0 + \u03c3 \u03c0 S amplitude in an analysis of BNL E852 data on diffractively produced \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + [210]. Although this wave exhibits a clear \u03c0(1800) signal also in our data (see Fig. 45b), it contains an additional broad enhancement at about 1.3 GeV/c 2 , which may contain the \u03c0(1300). However, the strong t dependence of the shape of the intensity distribution in this mass range suggests large non-resonant components. In order to reliably measure the \u03c0(1800) resonance parameters in this wave, the interference of the \u03c0(1800) with the other wave components that dominate the 1.3 GeV/c 2 region would need to be taken into account, like in our fit of the \u03c0(1800) in the 0 \u2212+ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 S wave. This, however, was not done in the analysis in Ref. [210]. The low-mass shoulder in Fig. 46a is well described by the non-resonant component. We do not find evidence for a possible \u03c0(1300) component in the 0 \u2212+ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 S wave (see Section VI.A.2 in Ref. [165] for details). Interestingly, the non-resonant component (black lines in Fig. 46c) has an extremely large slope parameter value of 26 +6 \u22125 (GeV/c) \u22122 and its t spectrum exhibits a dip at t \u2248 0.3 (GeV/c) 2 . This behavior is strikingly different from that of all other resonant components in our model and is in agreement with the absence of a significant \u03c0(1300) component in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 wave. Similar dip-like t spectra were observed in other inelastic diffraction-dissociation reactions, for example in the reaction n + p \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 + p [223,224], and were explained by a cancellation of double-Regge exchange processes and direct resonance production (see e.g. Refs. [225][226][227]). In contrast, the t spectrum of the \u03c0(1800), which is shown as blue lines in Fig. 46c, has an approximately exponential behavior with a slope parameter value of 8.8 +0.7 \u22120.3 (GeV/c) \u22122 , which is consistent with a resonance.",

The branching fractions into \u03c3\u03c0 and f 0 (1370)\u03c0 are also large, whereas those into the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 D wave and f 2 (1270)\u03c0 are small.

This applies in particular to the peak region in the intensity distribution of this wave as shown in Fig. 49b. Hence the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S amplitude has a large contribution of about 25 % to the minimum value of the \u03c7 2 function of the fit model (see Eq. (242)). The deviations of the model from the data induce a multi-modal behavior of the minimization procedure and comparatively large systematic uncertainties of the resonance parameters of the a 1 (1260) and of other resonances (see Sections IV.B and V in Ref. [165] for details). One of the challenges in describing the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S intensity distribution is that the peak in the a 1 (1260) region changes its position and shape as a function of t . This behavior is illustrated in Figs. 50a and 50b. At low t , the peak is located at about 1.15 GeV/c 2 and shifts toward higher masses with increasing t , up to about 1.30 GeV/c 2 in the highest t bin. In addition, the peak narrows significantly. This demonstrates the necessity to perform a t -resolved analysis. It is also a sign that contributions from non-resonant processes to this partial-wave amplitude are large. Indeed, the resonance-model fit finds a non-resonant component that is comparable in strength to the a 1 (1260) in the low and intermediate t range and that is even dominant at high t . The t spectrum of the a 1 (1260) in the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave exhibits an approximately exponential dependence on t (see Fig. 50c). However, the slope parameter has a value of 11.8 +0.9 \u22124.2 (GeV/c) \u22122 , which is larger than what one would expect for a resonance. The slope parameter value is similar to the one of the non-resonant component in this wave. This might be a hint that our resonance model is not able to completely separate the a 1 (1260) from the non-resonant component.",

We study this model dependence by performing a resonance-model fit, where the empirical parameterizations of the non-resonant components (see Eqs. (230) and (231)) are replaced by the square root of the intensity distributions obtained from the partial-wave decomposition of Deck Monte Carlo data (see Section 6.2.4). The result of this fit is shown as dashed curves in Figs. 50a and 50b. The model describes the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S intensity distributions well. At high t , the peak is described even better than in the main fit (see Fig. 50b), where we used the empirical parameterization in Eq. (231) for the non-resonant component. The shapes of the non-resonant component from the Deck Monte Carlo are for all t bins similar to those found in the main fit, but the yields are considerably smaller. In turn, the a 1 (1260) yields are significantly larger, in particular at high t .  From the 14-wave resonance-model fit to the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, we extract the Breit-Wigner parameters m a 1 (1260) = 1299 +12 \u221228 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 1 (1260) = 380 \u00b1 80 MeV/c 2 [165]. The large systematic uncertainties are mostly due to the issues discussed above. From the 6-wave fit to the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data, we obtain m a 1 (1260) = 1255\u00b16 (stat.) +7 \u221217 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 1 (1260) = 367\u00b19 (stat.) +28 \u221225 (sys.) MeV/c 2 [190]. In both analyses, the a 1 (1260) is described by a Breit-Wigner amplitude as in Eq. (154) with a parameterization of the dynamic width that takes into account the variation of the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 decay phase space across the resonance width [231] (see also Eq. (24) in Ref. [165]). Our mass values are compatible with the PDG estimate and our width values lie close to the center of the range estimated by the PDG [5].",

In the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data, most of the 1 ++ waves are dominated by the ground-state a 1 (1260) signal. This is true in particular for the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave. In this wave, the a 1 (1640) signal is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the a 1 (1260) signal (see Fig. 51a and cf. Fig. 50a). Since the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 S wave is the only 1 ++ wave in the 6-wave resonance-model fit of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data, no a 1 (1640) component was included.

The observed f 0 (980)\u03c0 decay mode is peculiar. Only few light mesons are known to decay into f 0 (980), among them only two isovector mesons, the \u03c0(1800) [110,165,184,210] and the \u03c0 2 (1880) [110] (see Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.5). Hence the 88-wave PWA model for the proton-target data includes only four waves with an f 0 (980) isobar (see Table IX in Appendix A of Ref. [110]), two of which, the 0 \u2212+ 0 + and the 1 ++ 0 + wave, are included in the 14-wave resonance-model fit. The coherent sum of the four f 0 (980) waves, which have all positive reflectivity, contributes only 3.3 % to the total intensity. Most of this intensity is due to the 0 \u2212+ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 S wave (see Section 6.3.1). The 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave contributes only 0.3 % to the total 115    intensity. This small relative intensity is the main reason why previous experiments were not able to observe the a 1 (1420) signal. As shown in Fig. 53a, the intensity distribution of the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave exhibits a narrow peak at about 1.4 GeV/c 2 that is associated by a rapid phase motion of about 180 \u2022 with respect to other waves, in particular with respect to the dominant 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave as shown in Fig. 53b. Both features are robust against changes of the PWA model and other systematic effects (see Section IV.F and Appendix B in Ref. [110]). The a 1 (1420) signal also appears in the freed-isobar PWA (see Sections 5.2.9 and 6.2.3) in the 1 ++ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 P wave. Figure 54a shows the correlation of the m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution of this wave with the m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + intensity distribution of the freed-isobar amplitude with J P C = 0 ++ . A clear peak is found at m 3\u03c0 \u2248 1.4 GeV/c 2 and m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u2248 1.0 GeV/c 2 . The m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution in the f 0 (980) region, as shown in Fig. 54b, exhibits a clear a 1 (1420) peak that is similar to the one in the conventional PWA (cf. Fig. 53a). The resonant nature of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + subsystem at the a 1 (1420) mass is proven by the Argand diagram in Fig. 54d, which exhibits a clear circular resonance structure in the highlighted f 0 (980) region. We observe a continuous evolution of the Argand diagrams with m 3\u03c0 , where the circular f 0 (980) structure rotates counterclockwise with respect to its center due to the phase motion caused by the a 1 (1420) signal thereby confirming its resonance-like nature. As an example, we show in Figs. 54c to 54e the Argand diagrams measured with respect to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave for three m 3\u03c0 bins. The results from the freed-isobar PWA therefore confirm the a 1 (1420) signal and prove in particular that it is not an artificial structure caused by the parameterizations that are used for the J P C = 0 ++ isobars in the conventional 88-wave PWA fit.",

Also the low intensity of the a 1 (1420) signal, which is about 20 times smaller than the one of the a 1 (1260) in the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave speaks against a |qq interpretation. It is peculiar that we find the a 1 (1420) signal only in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 decay mode. The f 0 (980) is known to have a large ss component and is interpreted by some models as a tetraquark, a molecular state, or a mixture of both [143,232]. Another interesting aspect of the a 1 (1420) is that its mass is suspiciously close to the KK * (892) threshold.",

The much smaller width of the f 1 (1420) of only 54.9 \u00b1 2.6 MeV/c 2 [5] could be explained by its strong coupling to KK * (892), which has a much smaller phase space than the decay a 1 (1420) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0. The molecular model for the f 1 (1420) proposed in Ref. [233] could possibly be extended to the isovector case. The a 1 (1420) signal was also described as a mixed state of a qq and a tetraquark component [234] and as a tetraquark with mixed flavor symmetry [235]. In addition, calculations based on the AdS/QCD correspondence find isovector tetraquarks with masses similar to that of the a 1 (1420) [236,237]. The authors of Ref.

            "text": "In addition to the resonance interpretations discussed above, other explanations do not require an additional a 1 resonance. Basdevant and Berger proposed resonant rescattering corrections in the Deck process as an explanation [239,240], whereas the authors of Ref. [182] suggested an anomalous triangle singularity in the rescattering diagram for a 1 (1260) \u2192 KK * (892) \u2192 KK\u03c0 \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0, which is shown in Fig. 55. The results of the latter calculation were confirmed in Ref. [183]. In order to study how well the amplitude of the triangle diagram describes the data in comparison to the Breit-Wigner amplitude, we have performed two resonance-model fits with a reduced wave set of only three waves: 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S, 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P , and 2 ++ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 D. In the first fit (dashed curves in Fig. 56), we use a Breit-Wigner amplitude for the a 1 (1420) (blue dashed curve), like in the 14-wave fit discussed above. In the second fit (continuous curves in Fig. 56), the Breit-Wigner amplitude is replaced by the amplitude of the triangle diagram (continuous blue curve). From these fits, we find that the amplitude of the triangle diagram describes the data equally well as the Breit-Wigner model. In the case of a triangle singularity, the production rate of the a 1 (1420) would be completely determined by that of the a 1 (1260). Therefore, the slope parameters of the two wave components would be equal. Unfortunately, in our analysis the systematic uncertainties of the slope parameters are too large in order to draw a conclusion. Hence more detailed studies are still needed in order to distinguish between the different models for the a 1 (1420).",

            "text": "The PDG lists three light-meson states with spin-exotic quantum numbers [5]: \u03c0 1 (1400), \u03c0 1 (1600), and \u03c0 1 (2015), which are all isovector states with J P C = 1 \u2212+ quantum numbers (see also Fig. 3). The \u03c0 1 (1400) has so far been observed only in the \u03b7\u03c0 final state [194,[241][242][243][244][245][246] with the exception of the Obelix experiment, which claims the observation of the \u03c0 1 (1400) in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 decay mode [247]. The \u03c0 1 (2015) is listed by the PDG as a \"Further State\" and has been observed only by the BNL E852 experiment in the b 1 (1235)\u03c0 and f 1 (1285)\u03c0 final states [248,249]. The \u03c0 1 (1600) is the best established of the three known spin-exotic light-meson candidates. It has been observed by several experiments in various decay modes. The COMPASS, E852, and VES experiments have studied high-energy inelastic scattering reactions of pion beams on nuclear targets and have reported \u03c0 1 (1600) signals in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 [165,190,210,216], \u03b7 (958)\u03c0 [195,250], b 1 (1235)\u03c0 [249,250], and f 1 (1285)\u03c0 [248,250] decay modes. In an analysis of Crystal Barrel data on the reaction pp \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the authors of Ref. [251] reported evidence for the \u03c0 1 (1600) in the b 1 (1235)\u03c0 decay mode. The CLEO-c experiment has studied the decays of the charmonium state \u03c7 c1 to \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [252]. They found evidence for an exotic signal in the \u03b7 \u03c0 subsystem consistent with the \u03c0 1 (1600) signal seen in other production mechanisms. A recent summary of all measurements can be found in Ref. [24]. Although significant intensity was observed by previous experiments in the \u03b7\u03c0 and \u03b7 \u03c0 P waves with M \u03b5 = 1 + , surprisingly the resonance content of the two P waves seems to be different: the \u03c0 1 (1400) is seen only in \u03b7\u03c0, whereas the \u03c0 1 (1600) is seen only in \u03b7 \u03c0. In addition, the VES group observed a significant suppression of the squared matrix element, i.e. the intensity divided by the two-body phase-space volume q \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 /m \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 (cf. Eq. (250)), of the P wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + in \u03b7\u03c0 compared to \u03b7 \u03c0 [192]. This favors a possible hybrid (qqg) or four-quark interpretation of the \u03c0 1 (1600) and disfavors a hybrid interpretation of the \u03c0 1 (1400) [253][254][255][256]. The \u03c0 1 (1600) is consistent with the lightest hybrid state predicted by lattice QCD (see Section 2.4) and models (see e.g. Ref. [24]). In contrast, the \u03c0 1 (1400) is too light for a hybrid state. Four-quark interpretations of the \u03c0 1 (1400) (e.g. the one in Ref. [256]) suffer from the fact that they predict additional SU(3) flavor partner states that have not been observed so far. It should also be noted that resonance-like signals were observed mostly in \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 systems that have the same charge as the beam particle. Such final states are produced predominantly via the exchange of Pomerons, which have vacuum quantum numbers and are commonly expected to have largely gluonic content. In contrast, in charge-exchange reactions no spin-exotic resonance signal was found in the \u03b7 \u03c0 0 final state by the VES experiment [257], while analyses of \u03b7\u03c0 0 data from the BNL E852 experiment yielded contradictory results [246,258]. A coupled-channel analysis of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data from the BNL E852 experiment found no evidence for the \u03c0 1 (1400) [259]. Although \u03c0 1 (1600) signals were claimed in various final states measured by several experiments, in most of these analyses the resonance interpretation of the \u03c0 1 (1600) relies on model assumptions and alternative explanations could not be ruled out completely. Hence the experimental situation is actually rather unclear. Particularly controversial is the \u03c0 1 (1600) signal in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 channel. The BNL E852 experiment used an 18 GeV/c pion beam incident on a proton target and was the first to claim a signal for \u03c0 1 (1600) \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03c0 based on a PWA performed in the kinematic range 0.1 < t < 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 [210,216]. The VES experiment used a 37 GeV/c pion beam on a solid-beryllium target and performed the PWA in the kinematic range 0.03 < t < 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 . They also observed significant intensity in the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave (see Fig. 57a). However, they found that the intensity distribution in this wave depends significantly on the PWA model and hence concluded that the wave is contaminated by intensity that leaks from the dominant 1 ++ waves into the 1 \u2212+ wave [260]. They neither excluded nor claimed the existence of the \u03c0 1 (1600). A later analysis of a BNL E852 data sample that was about an order or magnitude larger than the one used in Refs. [210,216] came to the conclusion that there is no \u03c0 1 (1600) signal in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 channel [211]. The authors of Ref. [211] performed systematic studies to find the optimal wave set and found that in the original BNL E852 analysis in Refs. [210,216] a number of important waves were missing in the PWA model. When they included these waves in the PWA model, the peak at about 1.6 GeV/c 2 in the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave disappeared. However, the slow phase motions with respect to other waves remained. This is shown in Fig. 57c for the kinematic range 0.18 < t < 0.23 (GeV/c) 2 , where the \"low wave\" points are the result of a PWA fit performed with the smaller wave set from Refs. [210,216] and the \"high wave\" points are the result of a PWA fit performed with the larger wave set from Ref. [211]. Based on this observation, the authors of Ref. [211] concluded that there is no evidence for a \u03c0 1 (1600) in this wave. For the discussion below it is important to note that this conclusion was based on a PWA performed in the range t < 0.53 (GeV/c) 2 . In contrast to the analysis in Ref. [211], the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data from the COMPASS experiment using a solid-lead target showed again evidence for a \u03c0 1 (1600) signal [190] (see Fig. 57e) although the PWA model contained even more partial waves than the one used in Ref. [211].",

As shown in Figs. 58a and 58b, the shape of the intensity distribution of this wave has a surprisingly strong dependence on t . At low t , the intensity distribution exhibits a broad structure with a maximum at about 1.2 GeV/c 2 (see Fig. 58a). This structure becomes narrower with increasing t and the maximum moves to higher masses, such that a peak emerges at about 1.6 GeV/c 2 in the two highest t bins (see e.g. Fig. 58b). This t dependence of the intensity distribution illustrates the necessity for performing the analysis in narrow t bins. It also indicates that, in addition to potential resonant components, this wave contains large contributions from non-resonant processes. This is consistent with the fact that we do not observe large phase motions with respect to other waves in the 1.6 GeV/c 2 region (see e.g. Fig. 58c).",

(153) and a non-resonant component parameterized using Eq. (231). The dashed curves in Fig. 58 represent the result of a fit, where the \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance component is omitted from the model so that only the nonresonant component remains in this wave. Although at low t , the intensity distribution is still reproduced roughly by the model (see Fig. 58a), it fails to reproduce the phases (see e.g. Fig. 58c) and the intensity distributions at higher t (see Fig. 58b). This demonstrates that the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data require a resonant component in the 1 \u2212+ wave. The resonance interpretation is supported by the fact that the coupling phases of the \u03c0 1 (1600) component relative to the other resonances in the model (see Eq. (238)) depend only weakly on t . In contrast, the coupling phase of the 1 \u2212+ non-resonant component with respect to the \u03c0 1 (1600) changes strongly with t , as does the shape of the non-resonant component (see Section VII in Ref. [165] for more details).",

Hence the non-resonant component dominates the 1 \u2212+ intensity at low t . Only for t 0.3 (GeV/c) 2 , the intensity of the \u03c0 1 (1600) component (blue lines in Fig. 60a) becomes larger than that of the non-resonant component. The simple exponential model in Eq.

However, this might be an artificial effect caused by an inappropriate description of the non-resonant component by our parameterizations. It seems that the fit is not able to completely separate the \u03c0 1 (1600) from the non-resonant component, which dominates at low t . This hypothesis is supported by the study discussed above, where the shape of the non-resonant component is determined from a model of the Deck process (see Fig. 60b). In this study, the \u03c0 1 (1600) has a larger yield at low t so that the resulting t spectrum of the \u03c0 1 (1600) is well described by the exponential model in Eq.

            "text": "The results from our t -resolved analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data explain the seemingly contradictory experimental findings of the BNL E852, VES, and COMPASS experiments concerning the existence of a \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 P wave. Figure 57b shows that our intensity distribution of the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave summed over the 11 t bins is very similar to the one found in the VES analysis [260] (cf. Fig. 57a). In Fig. 57d, we show the intensity of the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave in the range 0.18 < t < 0.23 (GeV/c) 2 that is obtained if we perform the PWA using the same two wave sets as in Ref. [211]. The similarity of the results with Fig. 57c confirms that the \u03c0 1 (1600) intensity peak in the original BNL E852 analysis in Refs. [210,216] was mostly an artificial structure caused by leakage of intensity from the 2 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P , 2 \u2212+ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 F , and 2 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 F waves that were missing in the PWA model. We also confirm the finding of Ref. [211] that in the region t 0.5 (GeV/c) 2 there is only weak evidence for the \u03c0 1 (1600). However, our data show that a resonance-like signal is required to describe the data in the region t 0.5 (GeV/c) 2 (see Figs. 58b and 58c). This t region was excluded from the analysis in Ref. [211]. In the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data taken with a solid-lead target, the contribution of the non-resonant component  is much smaller than in the proton-target data. The t -integrated lead-target data actually resemble the high-t region of the proton-target data (compare Figs. 57e and 57f). So far, no explanation has been found for this effect. The intensity distributions of the P wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + in the COMPASS \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data (black dots in Figs. 61a and 61b) are similar to previous observations. The \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 P -wave intensity shows a broad peak of about 400 MeV/c 2 width, centered at a mass of 1.4 GeV/c 2 . For m \u03b7\u03c0 > 1.8 GeV/c 2 , the intensity nearly vanishes. The \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 P -wave intensity is about a factor of 20 smaller than the dominant D-wave intensity. Hence the detector acceptance has to be simulated accurately in order to resolve the small Pwave contribution. In the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data, P and D waves have comparable intensities. The P -wave intensity distribution also shows a broad peak but the peak position is shifted to about 1.65 GeV/c 2 . Similar to \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 , the intensity is small in the high-mass region m \u03b7 \u03c0 > 2 GeV/c 2 . The differences in the shape of the P -wave intensity distributions in \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 remain after scaling the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 intensity distribution by the kinematic factor in Eq. (250) (see Fig. 61b). In addition, we observe an enhancement of about a factor of 10 of the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 P -wave intensity with respect to the scaled \u03b7\u03c0 P -wave intensity. This is in stark contrast to the striking similarity of the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 and the scaled \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 intensity distributions observed for the D and G waves (see Figs. 66a and 78b). The relative phases exhibit a pattern similar to the one of the intensity distributions. While the phases of the P wave relative to the D wave are significantly different in \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 for masses above 1.4 GeV/c 2 (see Figs. 61e and 61f), the phases between the D and G waves are nearly identical (see Fig. 78c). Naively, one could interpret this as different resonance content of the P wave in the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 final states consistent with the observations of the \u03c0 1 (1400) and the \u03c0 1 (1600) by previous experiments.",

            "text": "Fitting the COMPASS \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data using simple Breit-Wigner resonance-models, similar to the ones employed in previous analyses, yields \u03c0 1 (1400) resonance parameters from the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data and \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance parameters from the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data that are consistent with previous results [193][194][195]. However, the results for the \u03c0 1 resonances depend strongly on whether we include a coherent non-resonant component in the P waves and on how we describe the high-mass shoulder in the D waves (see Section 6.3.4). A more stable result can be achieved by performing an \u03b7\u03c0-\u03b7 \u03c0 coupled-channel fit to the P -and D-wave data using the unitary analytic model described in Section 5.3.5 (see green curves in Fig. 61). Compared to sum-of-Breit-Wigner models, this model improves, among other things, the description of the interference of the various resonances and the non-resonant components. The data are described well by the model. Since the model is analytical, the amplitude can be continued to complex values of s in order to identify its poles. In the mass range between 1 and 2 GeV/c 2 , two poles are identified in the D wave, corresponding to the well-known a 2 (1320) and the a 2 (1700) resonances. For the P wave, only a single \u03c0 1 resonance pole is extracted from the data, with parameters that are compatible with those of the \u03c0 1 (1600) (see below). This important and astonishing result puts strong doubts on the existence of a separate \u03c0 1 (1400) state in \u03b7\u03c0 and thereby resolves a long-standing puzzle. Fig. 62 shows the positions of the three poles extracted from the coupled-channel analysis of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 final states.",

            "text": "A remaining mystery is that the production of the \u03c0 1 (1600) in photon-induced reactions seems to be much less prominent than expected. The CLAS experiment did not observe a \u03c0 1 (1600) signal in the chargeexchange reaction \u03b3 + p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + + (n) miss [261,262] (see Fig. 64a). This finding is supported by an analysis of COMPASS data of the reaction \u03c0 \u2212 + Pb \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + + Pb in the range t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 , where photon exchange is dominant [263] (see Fig. 64b; more details of this analysis will be discussed in Section 7). In both processes, the dominant underlying reaction is \u03b3 + \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . Since we observe the \u03c0 1 (1600) to decay into \u03c1(770)\u03c0, it should couple to \u03b3\u03c0 via vector-meson dominance. This is because the photon fluctuates into quark-antiquark pairs with J P C qq = 1 \u2212\u2212 quantum numbers. In addition, the \u03c0 1 (1600) is a hybrid candidate and is compatible with the lightest 1 \u2212+ hybrid state predicted by lattice QCD (see Section 2.3 and Fig. 7). Lattice QCD and also many models predict that the lowest excitation of the gluon field in a hybrid meson has J P C g = 1 +\u2212 quantum numbers. Hence the qq pair from the photon and the gluonic excitation can directly couple to spin-exotic J P C = 1 \u2212+ quantum numbers, which is not the case for pion-induced reactions. Thus the production of hybrids is expected to be enhanced in photon-induced reactions [264,265], which seems to be contradicted by the nearly vanishing intensities that are observed in the 1.6 GeV/c 2 mass region. This, however, could be due to destructive interference of a \u03c0 1 (1600) with a non-resonant component. This hypothesis could be verified by performing resonance-model fits on the existing data. In the future, much more precise photoproduction data from the GlueX experiment at JLab will help to clarify the situation.",

            "text": "candidate for the first radial excitation, i.e. the 2 3 P 2 quark-model state. The five higher-lying states are listed as \"further states\" by the PDG and require confirmation. The a 2 (1320) has a large branching fraction into 3\u03c0 of 70.1 \u00b1 2.7 % [5]. The second most probable decay mode is \u03b7\u03c0 with a branching fraction of 14.5 \u00b1 1.2 %. In contrast, the decay into \u03b7 \u03c0 has only a small branching fraction of (5.5 \u00b1 0.9) \u2022 10 \u22123 and was first observed by the VES experiment [192]. The a 2 (1320) is the narrowest 3\u03c0 resonance and appears in the 3\u03c0 channel predominantly in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 D waves with M = 1 and 2 with very low background (see e.g. Fig. 65a). The a 2 (1320) peak is also associated with rapid phase motions with respect to other waves (see e.g. Fig. 65b). This makes the a 2 (1320) the cleanest resonance signal in our \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data. The \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data are dominated by the D wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + with a prominent a 2 (1320) peak (see Fig. 66c). In the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data, we observe in addition a D wave with M \u03b5 = 2 + and an intensity at the 5 % level with respect to the D wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + (see Fig. 66b). Also the D wave with M \u03b5 = 2 + contains a clear a 2 (1320) signal. As expected, the a 2 (1320) signal is much weaker in the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data (see Fig. 66d). As shown in Fig. 66a, the observed differences in the intensity distributions of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 D waves with M \u03b5 = 1 + are nearly completely explained by the kinematic factor in Eq. (250).",

            "text": "The a 2 (1320) peaks in the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data are well described by the employed Breit-Wigner amplitude. In the 14-wave resonance-model fit of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, the a 2 (1320) resonance parameters have the smallest uncertainties of all resonances in this fit. From this fit, we extract Breit-Wigner parameters of m a 2 (1320) = 1314.5 +4 \u22123.3 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1320) = 106.6 +3.4 \u22127.0 MeV/c 2 [165]. These values are consistent with the Breit-Wigner parameters m a 2 (1320) = 1321 \u00b1 1 (stat.) +0 \u22127 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1320) = 110 \u00b1 2 (stat.) +2 \u221215 (sys.) MeV/c 2 obtained from the 6-wave resonance-model fit of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data [190] and with the Breit-Wigner parameters m a 2 (1320) = 1315 \u00b1 12 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1320) = 119 \u00b1 14 MeV/c 2 obtained from the combined fit of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data [109]. Pole positions of the a 2 (1320) are extracted from fits of more advanced analytical models that were developed by the JPAC collaboration and are based on the principles of the relativistic S-matrix (see Section 5.3.5). From a fit to the intensity distribution of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 D wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + , we obtain the pole parameters m a 2 (1320) = 1307 \u00b1 1 (stat.) \u00b1 6 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1320) = 111 \u00b1 1 (stat.) \u00b1 8 (sys.) MeV/c 2 [70]. A coupled-channel fit of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 P -and D-wave amplitudes with M \u03b5 = 1 + yields the pole parameters m a 2 (1320) = 1306.0 \u00b1 0.8 (stat.) \u00b1 1.3 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1320) = 114.4 \u00b1 1.6 (stat.) \u00b1 0.0 (sys.) MeV/c 2 [71] (see curves in Figs. 66c and 66d). As shown in Fig. 67, the results of the Breit-Wigner fits are in good agreement with the PDG averages. The a 2 (1320) mass values from the pole positions are smaller than the Breit-Wigner masses. The result from Ref. [71] also prefers a larger width compared to the Breit-Wigner parameters.  Fig. 48 but for (a) the mass and (b) the width of the a 2 (1320). The pole parameters obtained from a coupled-channel fit of the COMPASS \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data by the JPAC collaboration (ROD2019, [71]) and from a fit of the D-wave intensity distribution in the COMPASS \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data (JAC2018, [70]) are marked by \u2022. These values and the Breit-Wigner parameters obtained from fits of the COMPASS diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data (AGH2018, [165]), the diffractive \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data (ADO2015, [109]), the photo-production \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data (ADO2014, [266]) (uncertainties are statistical only; see Section 7), and of the diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data (ALE2010, [190]) are compared with previous measurements. Note that the values from the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data (ALE2010, [190]) are already included in the present PDG averages for the 3\u03c0 decay mode. For the a 2 (1320) width in (b), the PDG provides only an estimate, which is not shown.",

            "text": "In the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data, the signal of the first radially excited 2 ++ state, i.e. the a 2 (1700), is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the one of the ground state, i.e. the a 2 (1320). This is similar to the situation in the 1 ++ sector (see Section 6.3.2). As a consequence, the a 2 (1700) is only included in the resonance-model fit of the much larger proton-target data set. In the 2 ++ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 D intensity distribution, the a 2 (1700) appears in the lowest t bin as a dip at about 1.7 GeV/c 2 due to destructive interference (see Fig. 68a and cf. Fig. 65a). The interference pattern changes with t such that the dip disappears with increasing t and turns into a subtle shoulder. As shown in Fig. 68b, the a 2 (1700) signal is clearer in the 2 ++ 1 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 P intensity distribution, where it appears as a high-mass shoulder of the suppressed a 2 (1320) peak. If the a 2 (1700) component is removed from the fit model, the shoulder cannot be described (see dashed curves in Fig. 68b). Figure 68c shows that the t spectrum of the a 2 (1700) is well described by the simple exponential model in Eq. (237) and has a slope parameter of 7.3 +2.4 \u22120.9 (GeV/c) \u22122 in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 wave, which is similar to the value of 7.9 \u00b1 0.5 (GeV/c) \u22122 for the a 2 (1320). 107 This supports the resonance interpretation of the a 2 (1700) signal. From the 14-wave resonance-model fit, we obtain Breit-Wigner parameters of m a 2 (1700) = 1681 +22 \u221235 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1700) = 436 +20 \u221216 MeV/c 2 [165]. Whereas our mass value is consistent with the PDG average, our width value is considerably larger and incompatible with the other measurements included in the PDG average (see Fig. 69). This could in part be due to our simplifying model assumptions, which may lead to an overestimation of the a 2 (1700) width. This hypothesis is supported by the results of the resonance-model fits of the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data using the more advanced analytical models developed by the JPAC collaboration (see Section 5.3.5). In the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data, the a 2 (1700) appears as a broad high-mass shoulder in the D-wave intensity distribution. This shoulder is more pronounced in \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 (see Figs. 66c and 66d). From a fit to the intensity distribution of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 D wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + , we obtain the pole parameters m a 2 (1700) = 1720 \u00b1 10 (stat.) \u00b1 60 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1700) = 280 \u00b1 10 (stat.) \u00b1 70 (sys.) MeV/c 2 [70]. A coupled-channel fit of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 P -and D-wave amplitudes with M \u03b5 = 1 + yields the pole parameters m a 2 (1700) = 1722 \u00b1 15 (stat.) \u00b1 67 (sys.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 2 (1700) = 247 \u00b1 17 (stat.) \u00b1 63 (sys.) MeV/c 2 [71] (see curves in Figs. 66c and 66d). Both pole positions are in agreement with the PDG average.",

This is at odds with the result of the L3 experiment, which observed a dominance of the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 over the f 2 (1270)\u03c0 decay mode in an analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state produced in two-photon collisions [267].

Not only is its mass too low in order to be the radial excitation of the \u03c0 2 (1670) ground state, but it also exhibits an unexpected decay pattern. The PDG does not list any 3\u03c0 decay modes and in particular no \u03c1(770)\u03c0 decay mode [5]. However, the \u03c0 2 (1880) is expected to decay into 3\u03c0 because it has been observed in f 0 (1500)\u03c0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 [220]. We have studied the \u03c0 2 (1880) decay modes into f 0 isobars using the freed-isobar PWA method (see Sections 5.2.9 and 6.2.3). Figure 72a shows the correlation of the m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution of the 2 \u2212+ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 D wave with the m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + intensity distribution of the freed-isobar amplitude with J P C = 0 ++ . We observe a clear peak slightly below m 3\u03c0 = 1.9 GeV/c 2 and at m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u2248 1.0 GeV/c 2 . This \u03c0 2 (1880) peak is also clearly visible in the m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution in the f 0 (980) region that is shown in Fig. 72b. The m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + intensity distribution at the \u03c0 2 (1880) peak position is shown in Fig. 72d and exhibits a narrow peak of the f 0 (980). The resonant nature of this peak is confirmed by the corresponding highlighted circular structure in the \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target (AGH2018, [165]), the photoproduction \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data (ADO2014, [266]) (uncertainties are statistical only; see Section 7), and diffractive lead-target data (ALE2010, [190]) are compared to previous measurements [5].",

In the \u03c1(770)\u03c0 F wave and the two f 2 (1270)\u03c0 S waves with M = 0 and 1, the \u03c0 2 (1880) component is small. The intensity distribution of the f 2 (1270)\u03c0 D wave as shown in Fig. 73a exhibits a peak at about 1.8 GeV/c 2 that is described mostly by the \u03c0 2 (1880) component. The non-resonant contribution is small. There is, however, considerable destructive interference of the \u03c0 2 (1880) with the \u03c0 2 (1670) and the \u03c0 2 (2005). As is shown in Fig. 73b, the peak is associated with a rapid phase motion. In our resonance model, the coupling amplitudes of the \u03c0 2 (1880) in the three 2 \u2212+ waves with M = 0 are constrained by Eq. (229). Therefore, the t spectra of the \u03c0 2 (1880) are very similar in these three waves. As an example, Fig. 73c shows the t spectrum of the \u03c0 2 (1880) in the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave. The distribution is approximately exponential and has a slope parameter value of 7.8 +0. 5 \u22120.9 (GeV/c) \u22122 , which is typical for resonances. We find \u03c0 2 (1880) Breit-Wigner parameters of m \u03c0 2 (1880) = 1847 +20 \u22123 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 \u03c0 2 (1880) = 246 +33 \u221228 MeV/c 2 [165].

The authors of Refs. [269,270] propose it as a hybrid candidate. This would be also consistent with the predictions from lattice QCD calculations (see Fig. 7). The authors of Ref.

We show, as an example, in Fig. 75a the t spectrum of the \u03c0 2 (2005) in the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave. It is described well by the exponential model in Eq. (236) with a slope parameter value of 6.7 +0.4 \u22121.3 (GeV/c) \u22122 that is in the range typical for resonances. Due to the slightly shallower t slope of the \u03c0 2 (2005) in comparison of the other 2 \u2212+ wave components, its signal is more pronounced at high t . The 2 \u2212+ 1 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave is the only 2 \u2212+ wave in the 14-wave resonance-model fit with M = 1. Hence in this wave, the \u03c0 2 (2005) amplitude is not constrained by Eq. (229). Nevertheless, the corresponding t spectrum is well described by Eq.

The measured t spectra hence support the resonance interpretation of the \u03c0 2 (2005) signal. That the data require a resonance in the 2 GeV/c 2 mass region is verified by comparing the main resonance-model fit with a fit without the \u03c0 2 (2005) component. In the latter fit, the model describes the intensity distributions and interference terms of the 2 \u2212+ waves less well, in particular for the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S and 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 D waves. Figure 75c shows, for example, that the high mass-shoulder in the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S intensity distributions is not reproduced well.

The \u03c0 2 (2100) PDG entry is based on two observations in diffractively produced \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + reported by the ACCMOR [173] and the VES experiments [184]. For both analyses, the set of 2 \u2212+ waves that were included in the resonance-  model fit differs from our choice. In addition, the resonance model was based on a K-matrix approach. 109 A potential caveat of our resonance model that might affect our measurement of the \u03c0 2 resonance parameters is that the three \u03c0 2 resonances have considerable overlap. As a consequence, our sum-of-Breit-Wigner ansatz might not be a good approximation anymore. Applying more advanced models is the topic of future research [186,187,274]. However, first studies also find three \u03c0 2 resonance poles in the analyzed mass region and seem to confirm the findings from our Breit-Wigner analysis at least qualitatively.",

In the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data, the a 4 (2040) appears in the intensity distribution of the G wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + as a broad peak below 2 GeV/c 2 (see Fig. 78a). In addition, the data exhibit a broad high-mass shoulder. The G-wave intensity distribution is contaminated by leakage of the order of 3 % from the dominant a 2 (1320) in the D wave (gray data points in Fig. 78a). This contamination is, however, well separated from the a 4 (2040) region. The intensity distribution of the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 G wave with M \u03b5 = 1 + is qualitatively similar to that of the     Fig. 48 but for (a) the mass and (b) the width of the a 4 (2040). The Breit-Wigner parameters obtained from fits of the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data (AGH2018, [165]), the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 \u2212 data (ADO2015, [109]), and the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + lead-target data (ALE2010, [190]) are compared to previous measurements [5]. \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 G wave (see black dots in Fig. 78b). It exhibits a peak consistent with the a 4 (2040) that is, however, a bit broader and shifted toward higher masses. The high-mass shoulder is more pronounced. Figure 78b shows that after scaling of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 intensity distribution with the kinematic factor in Eq. (250) (red triangles), the two G-wave intensity distributions become nearly identical. In particular the leakage from the a 2 (1320) is completely suppressed by the angular-momentum barrier factor in Eq. (250). Also the phases between the D-and G-wave amplitudes exhibit a striking similarity in \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 , as shown in Fig. 78c. For both final states, the a 4 (2040) resonance produces a slow rise of the phase around 2.0 GeV/c 2 . A combined resonancemodel fit of the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data yields Breit-Wigner parameters of m a 4 (2040) = 1900 +80 \u221220 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 4 (2040) = 300 +80 \u2212100 MeV/c 2 [109], which are consistent with the parameters obtained from the COMPASS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data. Figure 77 shows that, compared to the PDG average, the COMPASS data prefer a lighter and wider a 4 (2040). This is particularly apparent for the parameter values from the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, where we find the a 4 (2040) mass to be 60 MeV/c 2 smaller and the width 76 MeV/c 2 larger. The latter is in tension only with the extremely low width value of 180 \u00b1 30 MeV/c 2 reported by the authors of Ref. [273], our mass values, however, are lower than any of the other mass values included in the PDG average.",

The differential cross section d\u03c3/ dt follows approximately an exponential distribution e \u2212b t (see Eq. (133)), which corresponds to a dominant contribution from spin projection M = 0. For heavy nuclei, the slope parameter b is related to the geometrical size of the nucleus, i.e. b \u221d R 2 , where R \u221d A 1/3 is the nuclear radius. The cross section integrated over t from 0 to the first diffractive minimum is approximately proportional to A 2/3 , i.e. to the surface of the nucleus. The features of diffractive-dissociation reactions described above were, for example, studied by the FNAL E272 experiment with a 200 GeV/c pion beam impinging on C, Al, Cu, and Pb targets [275]. In addition to diffractive production, i.e. Pomeron exchange between the incoming beam particle and the target nucleus, also photon exchange is possible (see Fig. 79 in Section 4.1). Such a reaction is called Coulomb or Primakoff production. Primakoff production is described theoretically using the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams equivalent-photon approximation, which assumes that ultra-relativistic, i.e. quasi-stable, beam pions scatter off quasi-real photons of the electromagnetic field of the heavy target nucleus [276,277]. The equivalent-photon approximation relates the cross section \u03c3 \u03c0A for the experimentally observed process (257) to the cross section \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b3 for the process \u03c0 + \u03b3 \u2192 3\u03c0 [278][279][280]:",

A number of special features of photoproduction and of the analyzed Primakoff region t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 require modifications of the PWA model that was derived in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 6.2.3. Both Pomeron and photon have positive naturality (see Section 2.1.1). A PWA of diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + production on a lead target in the range 10 \u22123 < t < 10 \u22122 (GeV/c) 2 [288], showed that contributions from unnatural exchanges have negligibly small contributions, which is consistent with the expected Pomeron dominance at high energies (see Section 4.1). We therefore include only waves with positive reflectivity (see Section 5.2.3) in the PWA model. As was discussed in Section 7.1, in the analyzed t range the spinprojection quantum number of diffractively produced states is limited to M = 0, while states produced by quasi-real photon exchange have M = 1. 111 For both production processes, the scattering is coherent, i.e. the beam pion interacts with the target nucleus as a whole. Therefore, the total amplitude for reaction (257) is the coherent sum of the amplitudes for the two production processes and hence a rank-1 spin-density matrix (see Section 5.2.2) is used.

They significantly affect the measured t spectra (see Section 7.1) and also the production plane defined by the incoming pion and the intermediate state X is only poorly reconstructed because of the very small scattering angle of X. As was explained in Section 5.2.5, we construct from the model in Eq. (264) the probability density function in Eq. (201) that describes the \u03c4 3 distribution for given values of m 3\u03c0 and t . This function takes into account the acceptance of the detector but neglects smearing of the phase-space variables \u03c4 3 due to detector resolution. Taking resolution effects into account would require to convolve the theoretical model with a smearing function as in Eq. (202), where this function describes the experimental resolution in the whole phase space. Such a convolution approach is computationally very expensive. We thus use a different approach, where we modify the PWA model such that we take into account resolution effects in an effective way.",

The main difference with respect to a resonance-model fit is that here the dynamical amplitudes have no free parameters.

The coupling amplitudes C \u03b5 ki (t ), which are free parameters that are determined independently in each t bin, contain information about the t dependence of production strength and phase of component k in wave i with reflectivity \u03b5 (see Section 5.1.7). Since we perform the PWA fits in broad m 3\u03c0 ranges that fully contain the peak of the studied 3\u03c0 resonance k, we effectively integrate over the analyzed m 3\u03c0 range so that |C \u03b5 ki (t )| 2 corresponds to the total intensity of resonance k in the given t bin.

The points with error bars represent the result of the partial-wave decomposition in m 3\u03c0 and t bins, respectively, using the PWA models that were discussed in Section 7.2. The PWA in the Primakoff region t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 is performed in 40 MeV/c 2 wide m 3\u03c0 bins. In addition, we perform partial-wave analyses in 31 narrow nonequidistant t bins in the extended range t < 10 \u22122 (GeV/c) 2 for two broad mass regions around a 2 (1320) and \u03c0 2 (1670). Figure 82a shows the intensity sum of the 2 ++ 1 \u03c1(770) \u03c0 D waves with \u03b5 = +1 and \u22121 with a clear a 2 (1320) signal. The curve represents the result of a fit with a resonance model that will be discussed in Section 7.4. Figure 82b shows the corresponding intensity sum of the 2 \u2212+ 1 f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S waves with a clear \u03c0 2 (1670) peak.  In Figs. 82c to 82f, we show the results of the PWA performed in 31 non-equidistant t bins in broad mass ranges around the a 2 (1320) and \u03c0 2 (1670). As was discussed in Section 7.2, in the employed PWA model the 2 ++ 1 \u03c1(770) \u03c0 D amplitudes are described by a Breit-Wigner amplitude for the a 2 (1320). The t spectrum in Fig. 82c hence represents the a 2 (1320) intensity, where we again sum the intensities of the \u03b5 = +1 and \u22121 contributions. The t spectrum is fitted well by an incoherent sum of two exponentials similar to Eq. ( dt \u221d e \u2212b Prim a 2 (1320) t . (269) We obtain slope parameters of b diff a 2 (1320) = 374 \u00b1 25 (GeV/c) \u22122 and b Prim a 2 (1320) = 1292 \u00b1 53 (GeV/c) \u22122 . The latter value is in fair agreement with the one obtained in the Primakoff MC study that was described in Section 7.1 (cf. Eq. (261)). The fit of the t spectrum also provides an estimate of the diffractive background. For the a 2 (1320), it amounts to approximately 3 % of the total intensity in the Primakoff region. Applying the model in Eq. (269) to the t spectrum of the \u03c0 2 (1670) (see Fig. 82d), which is obtained by summing the intensities of the \u03b5 = +1 and \u22121 contributions, we find that the relative contribution of the diffractive background is significantly larger than for the a 2 (1320). In the Primakoff region, it amounts to about 14 %. This makes the separation of the contributions from Primakoff and diffractive production more difficult. As a consequence, additional constraints are needed to stabilize the fit (see Section 3.2 in Ref. [266] for details).",

Figure 82e shows the relative phase of the a 2 (1320) with M \u03b5 = 1 + and the a 1 (1260) with M \u03b5 = 0 + . For t < 6 \u2022 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 , this phase rises monotonically with t and levels off for larger t reaching a plateau at about 0 \u2022 . This reflects the continuous evolution from nearly pure Primakoff production of the a 2 (1320) at low t to nearly pure diffractive production at higher t . In the Primakoff region t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 , the relative phase is given by the phase difference of the Primakoff production amplitude for the a 2 (1320), which is approximately purely real, and the diffractive production amplitude of the a 1 (1260), which is approximately purely imaginary. This results in \u2206\u03c6 (\u03b5=+1) a 2 (1320), a 1 (1260) \u2248 \u221290 \u2022 . Assuming that the phase of the diffractive production amplitude of the a 2 (1320) has a t dependence similar to that of the a 1 (1260), interference effects between diffractive and Primakoff production of the a 2 (1320) are expected to be small. Hence the sum of two non-interfering contributions in Eq. (269) is a good approximation to describe the t spectrum. At higher values of t , both a 2 (1320) and a 1 (1260) are diffractively produced so that \u2206\u03c6 (\u03b5=+1) a 2 (1320), a 1 (1260) (t ) flattens and reaches approximately 0 \u2022 . Like for the a 2 (1320), we observe for the \u03c0 2 (1670) a phase difference of roughly \u221290 \u2022 between the M \u03b5 = 1 + (Primakoff-produced) and 0 + (diffractively produced) states in the f 2 (1270)\u03c0 S decay mode (see Fig. 82f). However, at larger values of t the phase difference does not approach 0 \u2022 but levels off already at approximately \u221250 \u2022 . This behavior is not yet understood.",

Like in atomic and nuclear physics, the multipolarities of the electromagnetic transitions, probe different aspects of the meson wave function. Several phenomenological models have been developed to describe electromagnetic decays of mesons, for example, the relativized quark model [15], the covariant oscillator quark model [290][291][292], and the vector-meson dominance model (see e.g. Ref. [293]). The latter model assumes that any soft interaction of photons with hadrons proceeds via intermediate vector-meson states, predominantly via the lightest ones, i.e. \u03c1(770), \u03c9(782), and \u03c6(1020). Some electromagnetic decays such as \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 are also calculable in the framework of \u03c7PT. The latest experimental result for \u0393[\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3] in Ref. [294] is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction from Ref. [295].",

The values of the nominal partial widths are taken from the PDG [289]. For a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03c0 D, we assume that this decay mode saturates the branching fraction BF a 2 (1320) \u2192 3\u03c0 = \u0393 a 2 (1320)\u21923\u03c0,0 /\u0393 a 2 (1320),0 = 70.1 \u00b1 2.7 % and we apply an isospin factor of 1/2 to correct for the unobserved a 2 (1320) \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay mode.

The employed parameterization for the total width of the a 2 (1320) is similar to the one used in the resonance-model fit of the diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data (see Section 6.2.4 and Section IV.A.1 in Ref. [165] for details). We also assume that the a 2 (1320) decays only into \u03c1(770)\u03c0 D (82 %) and \u03b7\u03c0 D (18 %), i.e. we neglect all other decay modes. We use Eq. (273) for \u0393 a 2 (1320)\u2192\u03c1(770)\u03c0D (m 3\u03c0 ) and Eq. (154) for \u0393 a 2 (1320)\u2192\u03b7\u03c0D (m 3\u03c0 ). For the \u03c0 2 (1670), the situation is more complicated. The \u03c0 2 (1670) decays nearly exclusively, i.e. with a branching fraction of 95.8 \u00b1 1.4 %, into 3\u03c0, which includes the decays into f 2 (1270)\u03c0 (56.3 \u00b1 3.2 %), \u03c1(770)\u03c0 (31 \u00b1 4 %), \u03c3\u03c0 (10.9 \u00b1 3.4 %), and [\u03c0\u03c0] S \u03c0 (8.7 \u00b1 3.4 %) [5]. In the analysis of the diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data (see Section 6.3.5), we observe sizable interference of different 3\u03c0 decay chains of the \u03c0 2 (1670). Therefore, the branching fraction information in the PDG is insufficient to construct a realistic 3\u03c0 decay model that takes into account these interferences. However, for our analysis the details of the parameterization of \u0393(m 3\u03c0 ) are not very important. They have only to a subtle influence on the peak shape, which mostly affects the estimates for m 0 and \u0393 0 , whereas the resonance yield that we are mainly interested in (see below) is basically unaffected by the choice of parameterization. Considering in addition the limited precision of our data in Fig. 82b, we choose a simple parameterization for the total width of the \u03c0 2 (1670), where we assume that the f 2 (1270)\u03c0 S decay mode saturates the total width and use Eq.

(270). We use the form factor from Ref. [281] that includes corrections, which take into account the distortion of the pion wave function in the Coulomb field. These Coulomb corrections were neglected in the previous measurements of the a 2 (1320) radiative width that used the Primakoff technique. However, as noted by the authors of Ref. [281], the Coulomb corrections can significantly reduce the Primakoff cross section and hence increase the estimate for the radiative width. This may explain that the COMPASS value for the a 2 (1320) radiative width lies above the values from the FNAL SELEX [284] and E272 experiments [303]. For COMPASS kinematics, accounting for the Coulomb corrections increases both radiative widths by 24 %. For SELEX kinematics, the increase is 15 %. The latter value is at variance with the conclusion of the authors of Ref. [284], who report that taking into account the Coulomb corrections had only a \"minor impact\" on their result.",

In the PWA model, all transition amplitudes have m 3\u03c0 dependences that are modelled using polynomials. The parameters of these polynomials are determined by fitting the m 3\u03c0 intensity distribution of each partial wave as determined by the PWA in m 3\u03c0 bins described above. Figure 83b shows the t dependence of the intensity of the coherent sum of all M = 0 waves and of the total \u03c7PT intensity. The dominant M = 0 intensity shows the typical shape for diffraction on a Pb nucleus, while the \u03c7PT intensity forms a sharper peak toward t = 0. A single-exponential fit to the latter results in a slope parameter of b \u03c7PT = 1447 \u00b1 196 (GeV/c) \u22122 . This value is consistent with b \u03c7PT, MC = 1600 (GeV/c) \u22122 that is obtained from MC simulation of quasi-real photon exchange. Since no isobaric waves with M = 1 are included in the PWA model, the \u03c7PT amplitude may wrongly absorb diffractive M = 1 contributions at higher t . However, at t \u2248 3 \u2022 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 , where for Pb we expect the maximum of the diffractive M = 1 contributions, the \u03c7PT intensity nearly vanishes. Fitting the \u03c7PT t spectrum over a broader t range and adding a diffractive contribution of the form t e \u2212b diff t , we estimate that the diffractive background is well below 5 % for t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 .",

Comparing the result of the freed-isobar PWA with the one of the conventional PWA, we find that the parameterizations employed in the conventional PWA do not cause artificial resonance-like structures in the extracted partial-wave amplitudes and that partial waves with [\u03c0\u03c0] S and f 0 (980) isobars can be well separated. Using the freed-isobar PWA method, we establish, for the first time, the 3\u03c0 decay modes \u03c0(1800) \u2192 f 0 (1500)\u03c0, \u03c0 2 (1880) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0, and \u03c0 2 (1880) \u2192 f 0 (1500)\u03c0 in a model-independent way.",

Due to the high precision of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, the resonance model employed for this data sample is the most comprehensive one. Out of the 88 waves, a subset of 14 partial waves with J P C = 0 \u2212+ , 1 ++ , 2 ++ , 2 \u2212+ , 4 ++ , and spin-exotic 1 \u2212+ quantum numbers was selected for the resonance-model fit. Compared to previous analyses of the 3\u03c0 final state, this is by far the largest wave set that is consistently described in a single resonance-model fit. The amplitudes of the 14 waves including all of their mutual interference terms are described simultaneously using 11 resonances. The resonance models for the other data samples contain only subsets of these resonances. For the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, we performed, for the first time, a simultaneous resonance-model fit in all 11 t bins. Using this novel t -resolved approach, we extracted the t dependences of the amplitudes of the resonant and non-resonant wave components in individual partial waves from the data in a model-independent way. This allows us to study the production mechanism of resonances in terms of their t spectra and of the t dependences of their relative phases with respect to other wave components. Most resonances are produced with a phase that is approximately independent of t , which is expected if a single production mechanism contributes over the analyzed t range. With the t -resolved approach, we also take into account the change of the shape of the m 3\u03c0 intensity distributions of the partial waves with t , which for some waves is very pronounced. Hence our approach avoids a potential broadening of resonance peaks and artificial incoherences between waves and wave components that may have led to dilutions and distortions of resonance signals in previous analyses. In addition, the t -resolved approach exploits the generally different t dependences of the resonant and non-resonant wave components in order to better disentangle the two.",

The parameters of a 2 (1320), a 4 (2040), \u03c0(1800), and \u03c0 2 (1670) are reliably extracted with comparatively small uncertainties. The values from the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-and Pb-target data are in good agreement. The a 2 (1320) and a 4 (2040) parameters from the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 data also agree with the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + results. The a 2 (1320) and \u03c0(1800) parameter values are consistent with the ones from previous experiments. Our values for the a 4 (2040) mass and width are the most accurate so far. We find a lower a 4 (2040) mass and a larger width than some of the previous experiments. The \u03c0 2 (1880) is found to decay into f 2 (1270)\u03c0D, f 0 (980)\u03c0D, and f 0 (1500)\u03c0D. Its coupling to the \u03c1(770)\u03c0F and f 2 (1270)\u03c0S decay modes is found to be small. This decay pattern contradicts model predictions that assume a hybrid interpretation of the \u03c0 2 (1880). The measured \u03c0 2 (1880) width is consistent with the world average, its mass is found to be smaller. The \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data require a third J P C = 2 \u2212+ resonance, the \u03c0 2 (2005), which has so far been reported by only two previous experiments. The a 1 (1260) parameters have large systematic uncertainties mainly because of large backgrounds from non-resonant components. Due to the dominant a 1 (1260) and a 2 (1320) signals, the parameters of their radial excitations, a 1 (1640) and a 2 (1700), are difficult to measure, which leads to large systematic uncertainties of the respective resonance parameters in the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data. Resonance-model fits of the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 data using Breit-Wigner amplitudes were inconclusive concerning the a 2 (1700) parameter values. This shows the limitations of our simple sum-of-Breit-Wigner approach. Together with the JPAC collaboration, we performed a resonance-model fit of the \u03b7\u03c0 D-wave intensity distribution using a more advanced model that adheres to the principles of the relativistic S-matrix, in particular analyticity and unitarity. This analysis yielded pole positions for a 2 (1320) and a 2 (1700) and showcases the superiority of this approach.",

The t -resolved analysis allows us to establish, for the first time, that for a proton target a significant \u03c0 1 (1600) signal appears only for t 0.5 (GeV/c) 2 , whereas at low t the intensity of the spin-exotic wave is saturated by Deck-like non-resonant contributions. This finding reconciles the seemingly contradictory results from previous experiments that led to a controversy about the existence of the \u03c0 1 (1600). Our values for the \u03c0 1 (1600) Breit-Wigner parameters have large uncertainties, which are mainly due to the large background contributions from non-resonant processes. The width measured in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data is larger than the values reported by previous experiments including our own result from the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + Pb-target data. Resonance-model fits of the \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0 data using Breit-Wigner amplitudes were inconclusive concerning the parameters of the \u03c0 1 in the spin-exotic P -waves. However, an \u03b7\u03c0-\u03b7 \u03c0 coupled-channel analysis performed by the JPAC collaboration using an analytic and unitary model based on S-matrix principles shows that the COMPASS data can be described consistently by only a single \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance pole. Breit-Wigner-based analyses of previous experiments required an additional \u03c0 1 (1400) resonance in order to explain the \u03b7\u03c0 data. However, compared to predictions from models and lattice QCD a \u03c0 1 (1400) would be too light and too close to the \u03c0 1 (1600). The JPAC result shows that no extra \u03c0 1 (1400) is required and that the \u03c0 1 (1400) signals found in previous analyses are probably due to the \u03c0 1 (1600).",

The a 1 (1420) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 signal was confirmed by the freed-isobar PWA, without separating the data into non-orthogonal waves with I G J P C = 0 + 0 ++ isobar resonances. If interpreted as a genuine resonance, the a 1 (1420) would be a supernumerary state and a candidate for a four-quark state. However, the peculiar properties of the a 1 (1420) signal indicate that it might not be due to a resonance but a triangle singularity, which is related to the a 1 (1260) ground state. Preliminary studies show that the latter hypothesis fits the data equally well as the Breit-Wigner amplitude.",

This process is strongly enhanced at very low squared four-momentum transfer t < 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) 2 . In this kinematic region, photoproduced states have spin-projection quantum numbers of M = \u00b11 with respect to the beam axis because of the transverse nature of the photon, whereas diffractively produced states have M = 0. We separated these contributions by means of a partial-wave analysis. Using the equivalent-photon approach, we determined the partial widths for a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 and, for the first time, the one for \u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 from the measured production cross sections of the resonances. In this analysis, we take into account sizable corrections from the distortion of the pion wave function in the Coulomb field of the nucleus, which have been neglected in previous measurements. The subprocess \u03c0 \u2212 + \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + that is embedded in the measured scattering reaction also allows us to test predictions from chiral perturbation theory at low three-pion mass.

A focus of current research is the improvement of the analysis models, in particular for the analysis of the high-precision \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + proton-target data, which is dominated by systematic uncertainties. We pursue two strategies in order to reduce these uncertainties: (i) by reducing the model dependence, e.g. by extending the freed-isobar PWA to more freed waves, and (ii) by employing more advanced models that incorporate more physical constraints, similar to what was done for \u03b7 ( ) \u03c0. For the latter, in particular a better understanding of the non-resonant contributions from double-Regge exchange processes, such as the Deck effect, is essential.",

            "text": "The exploration of the light-meson spectrum is a global effort with several experiments focusing on different parts of the spectrum. In addition to COMPASS, the VES experiment at IHEP (Russia) studies diffractive-dissociation reactions. Using a 29 GeV/c pion beam on a Be target, the VES experiment collected data samples of 87 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and 32 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events that are even larger than the COMPASS data samples of 46 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and 3.5 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events [125,[314][315][316][317][318]. Despite the lower beam energy and the different target, the PWA results from VES are in good agreement with the COMPASS results [318]. In particular, the VES experiment also observes a narrow peak in the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave of the 3\u03c0 data that is consistent with the a 1 (1420) signal observed by COMPASS. Two experiments at JLab are dedicated to the study of the light-meson spectrum: GlueX and MesonEx. The GlueX experiment [319][320][321][322][323][324] uses a high-intensity beam of linearly polarized photons that is produced from the primary 12 GeV electron beam of the CEBAF accelerator using coherent Bremsstrahlung from a thin diamond radiator. The produced photons have a most probable energy of about 9 GeV and a polarization of about 40 %. The MesonEx experiment at CLAS12 [325,326] studies electroproduction of mesons using an 11 GeV high-intensity electron beam from CEBAF. The quasi-real photons exchanged with the target have energies from 6.5 to 10.5 GeV. Both experiments study photoproduction of mesons on proton targets at intermediate energies. Due to the-compared to COMPASS-lower center-of-momentum energies, the photons may interact via various exchange processes with the target proton and also target excitations can be studied. This has the advantage that in contrast to high-energy pion diffraction, where the produced states are limited to isovector states with negative G parity, states with a wide variety of I G J P C quantum numbers are accessible. In particular, both experiments will search for the spin-exotic \u03b7 1 , which would be the isoscalar partner of the \u03c0 1 (1600). The \u03b7 1 is expected to decay, for example, into \u03b7f 2 (1270) and a 2 (1320)\u03c0, which can be measured e.g. in the \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 final state. But also spin-exotic states with J P C = 0 +\u2212 and 2 +\u2212 quantum numbers (i.e. b 0 , h 0 , h 0 , and b 2 , h 2 , h 2 ) that cannot be produced in pion diffraction are in principle accessible. As was discussed in Section 6.3.3, photoproduction of hybrid mesons is expected to be enhanced with respect to pion-induced reactions. In contrast, currently available data on 3\u03c0 photoproduction seem to suggest that the production rate of the hybrid candidate \u03c0 1 (1600) is suppressed although it is observed to decay into \u03c1(770)\u03c0. The data from the JLab experiments will help to solve this puzzle. A complication caused by the lower beam energies is the fact that particles emitted from the beam and the target vertex of the scattering reaction, i.e. beam and target fragmentation, are less clearly kinematically separated than in high-energy diffraction, making it necessary to take into account baryon excitations in the analysis of excited mesons. Light mesons are also studied at e + e \u2212 machines using two-photon processes, processes with initial-state radiation, and multi-body decays of tau leptons or heavy-quark mesons. The CMD-3 [327] and SND [328,329] experiments at BINP perform high-precision exclusive measurements of e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons cross sections up to center-of-momentum energies of 2 GeV. These data allow detailed studies of the properties of the light vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 and of their excited states in a large variety of final states. The BESIII experiment [330] at IHEP (China) also studies the light-meson spectrum, for example, by high-precision measurements of radiative J/\u03c8 decays. These decays are a rich source of light mesons and allow e.g. the study of f 0 and f 2 states up to high masses. Also the B-factories, i.e. the BABAR [331], Belle [331], Belle II [332], and LHCb experiments [333], have studied and are studying light mesons, although this research is not their main goal.",

            "text": "In the future, the PANDA experiment at GSI [334] will measure proton-antiproton annihilations in flight and will continue the successful meson-spectroscopy programs carried out by the Crystal Barrel experiment [335] at LEAR and by the E760 [336][337][338] and E835 experiments [339] at Fermilab. In addition to a broad heavy-meson spectroscopy program, which will in particular focus on the illusive X, Y , Z states, PANDA will also study light mesons. Proton-antiproton annihilations provide a gluon-rich environment, which should enhance the production of glueballs or hybrid states [340]. For example, isoscalar scalar mesons, i.e. f 0 states, can be studied in reactions like pp \u2192 3\u03c0 0 , \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 , \u03b7\u03b7 \u03c0 0 , KK\u03c0 0 , and 5\u03c0 0 [341][342][343][344], for which PANDA is expected to record high-precision data samples. At CERN, there are plans for a new fixed-target experiment covering a wide range of QCD-related research topics [345]. One of these topics is the high-precision study of the kaon excitation spectrum by measuring high-energy kaon-diffraction reactions. Compared to the non-strange light mesons, the kaon spectrum is not very well known [5]. From the spectroscopy point of view, it is of most importance to complete the light-meson SU(3) flavor nonets and to search for the SU(3) flavor partners of exotic states. A better knowledge of the kaon spectrum will also help to improve the analyses that search for CP violation in multi-body hadronic decays of D and B mesons, where kaon resonances appear in the subsystems of various final states. Using RF-separation techniques [346][347][348], the kaon fraction of the high-intensity hadron beam in the SPS M2 beam line could be dramatically enhanced so that data samples of much higher precision than any previous experiment could be obtained. For example, for the K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final state, data samples of the order of 10 7 events could be collected. Since the decay amplitudes \u03a8 \u03b5 i (\u03c4 n ; m X ) in our PWA model in Eq. (197) are constructed by recursive application of Eq. 152, they are linear combinations of products of Wigner D-functions and hence inherit the orthogonality property in Eq. (B.5). As a consequence, the off-diagonal elements of the phase-space integral matrix I \u03b5 ij for waves i and j with reflectivity \u03b5 as defined in Eq. 187vanish, unless the quantum numbers that determine the D-functions in the decay amplitudes are the same for both waves, i.e. the two waves have the same J P M \u03b5 quantum numbers and the same isobar and orbital-angular-momentum quantum numbers in the decay chain. 121 For orthogonal decay amplitudes, also the overlap Ovl \u03b5 ij (m X , t ) as defined in Eq. (211) vanishes. Depending on the analyzed final state, the orthogonality of the decay amplitudes is broken by the Bose symmetrization in Eq. (161). In practice, the corresponding off-diagonal elements of I \u03b5 ij are often still close to zero. It is important to note that decay amplitudes that correspond to decay chains with different radially excited states of an isobar resonance are in general not orthogonal and the corresponding elements of the integral matrix may have large magnitudes. In this case, the two decay amplitudes correspond to similar phase-space distributions, which may lead to ambiguity and distinguishability issues at the partial-wave decomposition stage (see also Section 5.2.8).",

The most widely used minimization algorithm for PWA is the MIGRAD algorithm from the MINUIT or MINUIT2 packages [175,176]. The algorithm uses an iterative decent method that belongs to the class of quasi-Newton methods, which are generalizations of the secant method to find the root of the first derivative for multidimensional functions. Since for these kind of problems, the secant equation does not specify a unique solution, the various methods differ in how they constrain the solution. The MIGRAD algorithm is based on an improved version of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) variable-metric algorithm [351][352][353][354][355], Since the method depends heavily on the knowledge of the first derivatives, it performs best if they are known precisely. Luckily, the log-likelihood function in Eq. (208) is simple enough to calculate the Jacobian analytically (see e.g. Ref. [149]) or using automatic differentiation [356]. In PWA fits, which may easily have hundreds of free parameters, the MIGRAD algorithm is known to find the minimum reliably.",

(198) approaches in the asymptotic limit a multivariate Gaussian in the parameters \u03b8, with the maximum at\u02c6 \u03b8 and the covariance matrix V\u02c6 MIGRAD provides a numerical estimate for the covariance matrix. However, the estimate of the HESSE routine of MINUIT, which calculates the covariance matrix according to Eq. (F.4) through inversion of the numerically estimated Hessian matrix of the minimized function, is usually better. The main caveat of the MIGRAD algorithm is that it requires a comparatively large number of calls of the likelihood function to converge to the minimum. Depending on the number of events in the (m X , t ) cell and the number of waves in the model, the computation of the log-likelihood function can be computationally expensive. In such cases, the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm [355,357,358] is a better alternative. It also belong to the class of quasi-Newton methods and requires an analytic Jacobian of the minimized function. L-BFGS uses a sparse approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix to find the minimum, so that the memory requirements grow only linearly with the number of free parameters. Therefore, it is well suited for PWA fits, which often have a large number of parameters. Another alternative minimization algorithm that is successfully used for PWA fits is called FUMILI [359,360]. It is based on the conjugate gradient method [355,361]. Both L-BFGS and FUMILI estimate only the function minimum. The covariance matrix of the parameters at the minimum has to be calculated separately. Due to the simple structure of the log-likelihood function in Eq. (208) the Hessian matrix can be calculated analytically (see e.g. Ref. [149]) or using automatic differentiation [356]. Using Eq. (F.4), this yields a more precise estimate for the covariance matrix compared to numerical methods.",

(b) Phase of this wave with respect to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave. The data points represent the result of the partial-wave decomposition in the first analysis stage (see Sections 5.2 and 6.2.3).

In each t bin, horizontal lines indicate the central value of the yield of the respective model component. The horizontal extent of the lines indicate the width of the t bins. The statistical uncertainty of the yield is represented by the height of a shaded box around the central value (for most bins invisibly small). The \u03c0(1800) component is shown as blue lines and light blue boxes, and the non-resonant component as black lines and gray boxes. The red and green horizontal lines represent the integrals of the model function over the t bins and can be directly compared to the data. The red and green curves represent fits using Eq. (237).

D. Anderson and S. H.

The term was later changed to meson[4].4 The strong isospin characterizes the approximate symmetry of the strong interaction between proton and neutrons, or u and d quarks, which is explicitly broken by the small mass difference between u and d. In the rest of the paper, the term \"isospin\" always refers to the strong isospin.",

The modifications are applied only to effectively take into account effects of experimental resolution. To demonstrate this, we performed a dedicated Monte Carlo study, which is based on the result from a fit of the PWA model in Eq. (268) to the measured data. 113 From the set of transition amplitudes that we obtain in each m 3\u03c0 bin, we then construct a PWA model according to Eq. (264) that we use to generate MC data. 114 In order to construct this MC PWA model, we scale each M \u03b5 = 1 + transition amplitude in Eq. (264) such that the corresponding intensity is equal to the sum of the M \u03b5 = 1 + and 1 \u2212 intensities of this wave in the PWA model in Eq. (268). The full Monte Carlo and reconstruction chain, which includes a detailed simulation of the detector resolution effects, is applied to the simulated events. The reconstructed Monte Carlo events are then fit using the same PWA model in Eq. 268that we use for the measured data. The fit result exhibits the same two features that we already observed in the PWA of the measured data: (i) for each M \u03b5 = 1 + wave in the simulated PWA model in Eq. 264, we find significant M \u03b5 = 1 + and 1 \u2212 components of this wave in the PWA result of the reconstructed MC data, with their intensity sum being close to the intensity of the simulated M \u03b5 = 1 + wave, and (ii) we observe reduced coherence between the M \u03b5 = 0 + and 1 + amplitudes. This study hence points to the necessity of summing up the intensities of the M \u03b5 = 1 + and 1 \u2212 components of each wave in each m 3\u03c0 bin to get the proper intensities of the Primakoff-produced waves. In Appendix J, we show that the effects discussed above can be explained by a substantial smearing of the \u03c6 GJ angle.",
