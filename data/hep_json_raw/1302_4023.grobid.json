CDF uses data corresponding up to 9.0 fb \u22121 to measure the ratio R of the branching fractions B(t \u2192 W b)/B(t \u2192 W q), the branching fraction for top-quarks decaying into \u03c4 leptons and the cross section for the production of an additional \u03b3 in tt production. The results from all these measurements agree well with their respective Standard Model expectation. D\u00d8 uses 5.3 fb \u22121 of data to measure the tt cross section as a function of the time. A time dependency would imply Lorentz invariance violation as implemented by the Standard Model extension. No time dependency is observed and D\u00d8 sets first limits in the top-quark sector for Lorentz invariance violation. D\u00d8 also determines indirectly the top quark width using the results of earlier measurements at D\u00d8. The measured top quark width is in agreement with the SM expectation and does not show any hints for new physics contributions.",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and was discovered at the Tevatron pp collider in 1995 by the CDF and D\u00d8 collaboration [1,2] with a mass around 173 GeV. The production is dominated by the qq annihilation process with 85% as opposed to gluon-gluon fusion which contributes only 15%. The top quark has a very short lifetime, which prevents any hadronization process of the top quark. Instead bare quark properties can be observed by measuring top quark properties. The measurements presented here are performed using either the dilepton (\u2113\u2113) final state or the lepton+jets (\u2113+jets) final state. Within the \u2113+jets final state one of the W bosons (stemming from the decay of the top quarks) decays leptonically, the other W boson decays hadronically. For the dilepton final state both W bosons decay leptonically. The branching fraction for top quarks decaying into W b is almost 100%. Jets originating from a beauty quark (b-jets) are identified by means of a neural network (NN) built by the combination of variables describing the properties of secondary vertices and of tracks with large impact parameters relative to the primary vertex.",

The data is selected by requiring a lepton, missing transverse energy E T , at least three jets with exactly one or two b-jets. Figure   1(a) shows the number of data events with their respective number of background events for different jet and b-jet bins. As an example three different templates with different values of R are shown: R = 0.1 (green dashed histogram), R = 0.5 (blue dashed histogram) and R = 1.0 (red dashed histogram). A simultaneous log-likelihood fit to R = B(t \u2192 W b)/B(t \u2192 W q) and to the tt cross section \u03c3 pp\u2192tt is applied. The resulting log-likelihood is shown in Figure 1b). An inclusive tt cross section of \u03c3 pp\u2192tt = 7.5 \u00b1 1.0 (stat. + syst.) is measured in good agreement with earlier measurements at the Tevatron. The ratio R of the branching fractions is measured to R = 0.94 \u00b1 0.09 (stat. + syst.). The presented measurement of R agrees with the SM expected value and with measurements from D\u00d8 and CMS: an earlier measurement of R by D\u00d8 results in R = 0.90 \u00b1 0.04(stat. + syst.) [4] and the currently most precise R measurement from CMS presented at this conference yields R = 0.98 \u00b1 0.04 [5]. Assuming 3 generations and unitarity of the CKM matrix CDF also measured V tb to 0.97\u00b10.05(stat. + syst.), which is in good agreement with the SM expectation.",

It relies on the precise measurement of the \u03c4 cross section in tt production, which selects an e or \u00b5 originating from the W decay or the leptonic \u03c4 decay and thus allows for one hadronic \u03c4 decay (more details can be found in [7]). In addition to the usual kinematic cuts an requirements on identified b-jets events are selected by imposing a certain log-likelihood cut enhancing \u03c4 fraction of events. The likelihood combines the following variables: E T , transverse mass of lepton plus E T and the transverse energy of the third highest E T jet. Figure 2(a) shows the log-likelihood distribution before applying any cut. Imposing a minimum log-likelihood value of 0 yields the final event selection with 36 observed events to be compared with the SM expectation of 33.6\u00b10.7 +3.7 \u22123.8 events. Figure 2(b) shows the final event selection after applying the log-likelihood cut of 0; data are nicely described by the signal and background contributions.

The measurement is based on the \u2113+jets decay channel and thus events are selected by requiring a lepton, E T , at least three jets with one identified b-jet and a photon. The photon candidate is required to have E \u03b3 T > 10 GeV and no track with p T > 1 GeV and at most one track with p T < 1 GeV, pointing at the calorimeter cluster; and minimal leakage into the hadronic calorimeter. Figure  3 (left) shows that pre-selected data events are well described by all the various background contributions. A tight \u03c7 2 cut on the photon identification suppresses largely the background   Figure 3 (right). The most dominant remaining background contribution originates from miss-identification of jets as photons. In order to get a handle on this contribution the isolation cuts are not applied and Z \u2192 ee events are used to extrapolate the isolation shape to the used cuts at higher isolation values. Taking into account this fake photon contribution, all the other backgrounds and the signal contribution the expected amount of events is 26.9 \u00b1 3.4 (e and \u00b5 channel combined). The probability of the background alone to mimic the observed signal of 30 events is: 3 standard deviations.

For the analysis tt events in the \u2113+jets final state are selected with a lepton (e/\u00b5), at least four jets, exactly one jet identified as a b-jet and E T . In addition the analysis relies on the timestamp of the data at production time. The Standard Model Extension (SME) [10] is an effective field theory and implements terms that violate Lorentz and CPT invariance. The modified SME matrix element adds Lorentz invariance violating terms for the production and decay of tt events to the Standard Model terms. The SME predicts a cross section dependency on siderial time as the orientation of the detector changes with the rotation of the earth relative to the fixed stars. The luminosity-corrected relative tt event rate (R) is expected to be flat within the Standard Model, i.e. no time dependency of the tt production cross section. Figure 4 shows this ratio as a function of the siderial phase, i.e. 1 corresponds to one siderial day. There is no indication of a  time dependent tt production cross section. Instead this measurement sets the first constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in the top quark sector. As the top quark decays before it can hadronize the constraints are also the first ones for a bare quark.",
