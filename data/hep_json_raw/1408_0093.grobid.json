Particle mass dependent hardening of the spectral shapes in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV were attributed to hydrodynamical flow and quantitatively parameterized with Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave fits. In this contribution, we investigate the existence of collective phenomena in small systems: pp, p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb where similar patterns are observed in multiplicity dependent studies.",

            "text": "Identified charged particle transverse momentum spectra in p-pbar collisions were extensively studied as a function of incident energy below 900 GeV at CERN SppS [1] and up to 1800 GeV at Fermilab Tevatron [2]. Starting from 200 GeV, a deviation of the p T of kaons as a function of \u221a s relative to the expectations based on the extrapolation of ISR data was reported by the UA5 Collaboration [3]. The E735 Collaboration saw evidence for a mass dependence of the p T as a function of c.m. energy from 300 to 1800 GeV and of the p T as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 at 1800 GeV [2]. The origin of these experimental observations is still under debate. QCD inspired models like PYTHIA [4] and EPOS [5] reproduce the experimental trends observed at Tevatron considering multiple partonic interactions and rescattering or a hydrodynamic type evolution with flux tube initial conditions, respectively. At about four times larger incident energies, the case of the present study, such processes become more important and contribute to a large energy transfer, well beyond the deconfinement energy density. Therefore, it is quite probable that at such energies a piece of matter of proton size explodes hydrodynamically once the energy transfer becomes significantly large [6].",

The present analysis has been done in |y| < 0.5. The particle identification was based on a Bayesian approach using the information from ITS, TPC and TOF. The detector response functions and the a priori probabilities were obtained from the experimental data. The contaminations from weak decays products and from particles produced by the interactions with the detector material were estimated based on a data driven method. All the correction factors were estimated using simulations based on the PYTHIA event generator [10] (tune Perugia0 [11]) and the GEANT3 [12] transport code. The corrections determined for the MB case were applied for all the multiplicity bins and their variations as a function of multiplicity, proved to be very small, were included in the systematic errors.",

In the bottom row of Fig. 1a the ratios of p T distributions at different multiplicities relative to the mult > 0 case are represented. One could observe a systematic change in the shape of the ratios, i.e. a depletion in the low p T region which shows a tendency to level off at larger p T values. The amount of depletion clearly depends on the mass of the species and on the multiplicity, i.e. it is enhanced going from pions to protons and with increasing multiplicity for a given mass. The K + /\u03c0 + , p/\u03c0 + and p/K + ratios as a function of p T are plotted in Fig. 1b -upper row for the second and the sixth multiplicity bins. The general trends observed in Fig. 1a can be seen in a more quantitative way in these representations, especially in the bottom row of Fig. 1b, where the ratios of relative yields for the two multiplicities to the ones corresponding to N raw ch >0 are represented. The observed depletion of p/\u03c0 + and p/K + at low p T , increasing with the multiplicity and decreasing towards 1.4-2.0 GeV/c looks similar with the trends observed in A-A collisions, the heavier particles being pushed towards larger transverse momenta. Such behavior, observed in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV [13], was attributed to  Figure 2: a) p T dependence of p/\u03c0 + ratio for the second and highest multiplicity bins in pp collisions; b) p T dependence of (p + p)/(\u03c0 + +\u03c0 \u2212 ) ratio in p-Pb for 60-80% and 0-5% multiplicity classes and Pb-Pb for 80-90% and 0-5% centrality [14]; c) The ratios of the ratios presented in a) and b).",
