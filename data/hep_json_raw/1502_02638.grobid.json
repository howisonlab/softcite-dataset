            "text": "The properties of excited B mesons containing a light quark can be described in the context of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) [1]. Since the mass of the b quark is much larger than the QCD scale, the Lagrangian can be expanded in powers of 1/m b , where the leading term defines the static limit (m b \u2192 \u221e). In the heavy quark approximation, the B mesons are characterised by three quantum numbers: the orbital angular momentum L (S, P, D for L = 0, 1, 2 respectively) of the light quark, its total angular momentum j q = |L \u00b1 1 2 |, and the total angular momentum J = |j q \u00b1 1 2 | of the B meson. The spectroscopic notation has the form n 2S+1 L J , where S = 0 or 1 is the sum of the quark spins and where the quantum number n describes the radial excitations of the state. The PDG notation [2] (which is used in this paper) has the form B J (nL), where m is the mass in units of MeV, 1 the * superscript is given to those states with natural spin-parity P = (\u22121) J (J P = 0 + , 1 \u2212 , 2 + , . . .), and the subscript J is omitted for pseudoscalar and vector states. A prime may be used to distinguish two states with the same quantum numbers.",

            "text": "For L = 0, there are two possible (J; j q ) combinations, both parity-odd, corresponding to the B meson ground state with J P = 0 \u2212 and to the excited B * state with J P = 1 \u2212 . Higher excitations are collectively referred to as B * * states and decay strongly to lighter B mesons and pions. For L = 1 there are four different possible (J; j q ) combinations, all parity-even. Predictions for the masses of such states and higher excitations spread over  [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. The boxes cover the range of predictions for the masses of each state, and the red dots indicate the measured values. The horizontal lines correspond to the B\u03c0 (red) and B * \u03c0 (blue) thresholds. a wide range of values, as shown in figure 1 [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. As can be seen in figure 1, the states come in doublets (two values of J for each j q ), and within each doublet, one has natural and one unnatural spin-parity quantum numbers. States with natural spin-parity (except for 0 + ) can decay to both B\u03c0 and B * \u03c0 final states. States with unnatural spin-parity cannot decay to the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar B\u03c0 final state due to parity conservation, but may decay to B * \u03c0 (table 1). Since the B * meson decays to B\u03b3, the signature from a doublet of B * * states is given by three peaks in the B\u03c0 mass spectrum (unless the doublet includes a 0 + state): one from the natural spin-parity state decay to B\u03c0, and two from both states decaying to B * \u03c0 with a missing photon. Due to the missing photon, the peaks from B * \u03c0 decays are shifted down from the true B * * mass by the difference between the B * and B masses (this feature recently allowed a precise determination of the B * \u2212 B mass difference from the B + K \u2212 spectrum [11]). Depending on the widths of the states and the mass resolution, two or all three of these peaks may overlap and be hard to distinguish experimentally. The B * 0 and B 1 states are predicted to be very broad [3,10] since they decay via S-wave (the comparable states in the charm sector have widths of around 300 MeV [2]). However, the B 1 and B * 2 states decay only via D-wave and are predicted [3,10] and observed [2] to be much narrower. Higher states such as the B(2S), 1 Natural units where = c = 1 are used.",

In contrast to the situation in the charm sector, there is relatively little experimental information concerning B meson spectroscopy. The B 1 (5721) 0 and B * 2 (5747) 0 states have been observed by the CDF [14] and D0 [15] experiments, and recently the CDF collaboration has presented results on the charged isospin partners, together with evidence for a higher mass resonance [16]. This result has prompted theoretical speculation about the origin of the new state [17][18][19][20][21]. While in the D meson system amplitude analyses of excited states produced in B decays can be used to determine their spin and parity (see, for example, refs. [12,13,22]), in the B meson system it is very difficult to assign with certainty quantum numbers to observed states. The labelling of the states follows the quark-model expectations for the quantum numbers, which have not been experimentally verified.",

Excited B mesons are seen as peaks in the RS invariant mass distributions, and are fitted with relativistic Breit-Wigner (RBW) functions. An additional very broad component, observed in the RS and not in the WS combinations, is referred to as \"associated production\" (AP) in this paper.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector [25] surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [26] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV, and an impact parameter measurement with resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with large momentum transverse to the beamline (p T ). Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [27]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [28]. The trigger [29] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which uses information from the vertex detector and tracking system.",

The B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 selections require a B candidate with p T > 3 GeV and a decay time of at least 0.3 ps. For the other decay modes, the selection explicitly requires that the software trigger decision is based only on tracks from which the B meson candidate is formed. No requirement is imposed on how the event was selected at the hardware trigger stage. Additional loose selection requirements are placed on variables related to the B meson production and decay, such as transverse momentum and quality of the track fits for the decay products, detachment of the B candidate from the PV, and whether the momentum of the B candidate points back to the PV. Because B 0 mesons oscillate, the distinction between RS and WS combinations is clearest at short B 0 decay times, and hence only B 0 candidates with decay time below 2 ps are used in the analysis.",

As described in section 1, a doublet of states is expected to give rise to three peaks. For example, for the (B(2S), B * (2S)) doublet the higher (lower) mass of the pair has natural (unnatural) spin-parity. The description with three RBW shapes, two of which are constrained to have means offset by the B * \u2212 B mass difference, is therefore a physically motivated choice, obtained by applying quark-model expectations to the new states. However, there are two possibilities for this configuration, since it may be either the lower or the higher of the states that gives rise to two peaks. The alternative, with only two RBW shapes, is an empirical model, that corresponds to the minimal choice necessary to obtain a satisfactory description of the data. This is taken as the default and is referred to hereafter as the empirical model, but results of alternative fits with three RBW shapes are also presented. The RBW shapes have several parameters which need to be fixed in the fits, in particular the spin and effective radius input to the Blatt-Weisskopf form factors. The B 1 (5721) 0,+ and B * 2 (5747) 0,+ resonances are assigned spin 1 and 2, respectively, and are both assumed to decay via D-wave (l = 2), while the two higher mass resonances are assigned spin 0 (l = 0) in the default fit. The effective radius is fixed to 4 GeV \u22121 [13]. The mass resolution is around 2 MeV which is negligible compared to the natural widths (> 20 MeV) of the resonances, and is therefore not modelled. The variation of the signal reconstruction efficiency with Q value is described with a fifth-order polynomial function with parameters determined from simulation. All signal parameters except the yields are shared between the different p T bins and B meson decay modes, though the efficiency function is determined independently for each p T bin.",

            "text": "Structures at higher mass are clearly observed in the Q-value distributions. To investigate the significance of the high mass states, large samples of pseudoexperiments are generated and fitted with different configurations. To cover the dominant systematic uncertainty on the yield of these states which arises due to lack of knowledge of the shape of the AP component, the pseudoexperiments are generated with the AP shape that minimises the significance. A first ensemble is generated without any high mass states included. Each pseudoexperiment in this ensemble is fitted twice, once with the same model as used for generation and once with an additional high mass resonance included. The distribution of the difference of \u03c7 2 values between the two fits is extrapolated to obtain the p-value corresponding to the probability to find a \u03c7 2 difference as large or larger than that obtained from the corresponding fits to data. This procedure gives significances of 9.6\u03c3 for the B + \u03c0 \u2212 case and 4.8\u03c3 for the B 0 \u03c0 + case.",

The empirical fit uses two, and the quark model fits three, RBW shapes to model the broad resonances. The listed uncertainties are, from left to right: the statistical uncertainty, the experimental systematic uncertainty, and, where applicable, the uncertainty on the B meson mass and the uncertainty on the B * \u2212 B mass difference. Note that any state not explicitly labelled as \"natural\" is considered to have unnatural spin-parity (and not to be 0 + ); the reported mass can be converted into the corresponding result under the 0 + spin-parity assumption by subtracting the B * \u2212 B mass difference.
