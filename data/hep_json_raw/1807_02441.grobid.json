So far the top quark has been produced only in hadron collisions, at the Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider (LHC); however, top-quark production in electron-positron collisions would herald a new frontier of complementary and improved precision measurements. For example: a top-quark pair production threshold scan would provide a precise measurement of the top-quark mass, which is a fundamental SM parameter; precise measurements of top-quark production observables could give unique sensitivity to new physics effects, as could the search for rare top-quark decays; new particles could be observed that couple preferentially to top quarks; and improved measurements of the top Yukawa coupling could further illuminate the Higgs sector.",

It is based on a unique and innovative two-beam acceleration technique that can reach accelerating gradients of 100 MV/m. CLIC is proposed as a staged collider providing high-luminosity e + e \u2212 collisions at centre-of-mass energies, \u221a s, from a few hundred GeV up to 3 TeV [1]. Top-quark pair production is accessible at the first energy stage, and an energy scan over the tt production threshold is also proposed. The higher-energy stages will supplement the initial energy datasets with large samples of top quarks, further enhancing the sensitivity to new physics.",

Thereafter, sections are dedicated to measurements of the top-quark mass, top-quark pair production, the study of the associated JHEP11(2019)003 production of top quarks and a Higgs boson, top-quark production through vector boson fusion, and searches for rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) top-quark decays. Measurements are considered at all energy stages of the collider. Most of these analyses are done using full event simulation and reconstruction, and are reported for the first time in this paper. To demonstrate the wider implications of the CLIC top-quark physics programme, the final section is dedicated to phenomenological interpretations. These are based on the study of top pair-production in full simulation and consider a variety of different observables, including so-called \"statistically optimal observables\".

The beam emittance is reduced in damping rings in the injector complex, and very small emittances are maintained through the accelerator chain, so that the resulting beams are highly-focused and intense in order to produce high instantaneous luminosities. This results in significant beamstrahlung 1  [3], which means that although the average number of hard e + e \u2212 interactions per single bunch train crossing is less than one, there are high rates of two-photon processes that deposit additional energy in the detector [4]. Furthermore, the beamstrahlung results in a long lower-energy tail to the luminosity spectrum, as shown in figure 1 for operation at \u221a s = 380 GeV and 3 TeV [4]. The fractions of the total luminosity delivered above 99% of the nominal \u221a s are given in table 1, and the effect is seen to be particularly significant at \u221a s > 1 TeV. The CLIC detector design and event reconstruction techniques are optimised to mitigate the influence of the beam-induced backgrounds, as discussed in subsection 5.3. The impact of initial-state radiation (ISR) on the effective centre-of-mass energy is similar to that of beamstrahlung.",

At the higher-energy stages, the dominant single-and double-Higgs production JHEP11(2019)003 mechanisms are through WW-fusion which is significantly enhanced (by around 80%) for running with -80% electron polarisation, owing to the underlying chiral structure of the electroweak interaction [6].

The two detector concepts, shown schematically in figure 2, are discussed in detail in [4]. The detectors are described using a right-handed coordinate system with the z-axis along the electron beam direction, and \u03b8 denotes the polar angle w.r.t. the z-axis.

The integration times used for the formation of clusters are 10 ns in the ECAL, the HCAL endcaps and in the silicon detectors, and 100 ns in the HCAL barrel. The latter is chosen to account for the more complex time structure of hadronic showers in the tungsten-based barrel HCAL. With these parameters, sub-ns time resolution is achieved for reconstructed particle-flow objects consisting of tracks and calorimeter clusters. This allows energy deposits from hard physics events and those from beam-induced backgrounds in other bunch-crossings to be sufficiently distinguished.",

Next, we introduce the Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework that we use to parametrise new physics effects in the top-quark electroweak interactions.

At the level of currently achievable experimental uncertainties for top-quark mass measurements these corrections, which significantly modify the simple leading-order picture of a particle with a definite mass that decays to an observable final state, cannot be neglected. Most experimental studies of the top-quark mass therefore rely on multi-purpose MC event generators to measure a parameter of the generator associated with the top-quark mass. The interpretation of these top-quark mass measurements relies on the quality of the MC modelling of the observables used; it also suffers from the fact that the MC top-quark mass parameter is not fully understood at present from a quantum field theory perspective.",

The top-quark pole mass is numerically close to the mass parameter of MC generators, but may not be identified with it; another scheme that has a close numerical relation to the generator mass parameter is the MSR mass, see for example [13]. In precision calculations at high energies, the MS (modified minimal subtraction) mass scheme is frequently used. However, for the treatment of the threshold region (shown in figure 5), neither the pole mass nor the MS mass is adequate, since they both show poor convergence and are subject to larger QCD corrections. At the threshold, two commonly used mass schemes are the 1S [14] and the PS [15] mass schemes, both of which result in stable behaviour of the calculated cross section in the threshold region and can also be related to the MS mass in a theoretically rigorous way with high precision [16], for use in other perturbative calculations.

A precise measurement of the topquark pair threshold line shape can thus be used to extract the top-quark mass to excellent precision and with a rigorously defined mass scheme as introduced in subsection 4.1, and can also be used to obtain other top-quark properties [26][27][28].",

The same tools also allow simulation of top-quark pair production in association with a Higgs or a Z boson at NLO in QCD and including finitewidth effects. Electroweak NLO corrections [37][38][39] are known to be sizeable at high energy, reaching order 20% on the total cross section and on A FB for a 1 TeV collider [40]. They will thus play a role in the high-energy stages of CLIC. The resummation of log-enhanced QCD effects might also be important in the regime of boosted top quarks. Such calculations have been performed for the LHC [41] and for lepton colliders [42,43]. It is expected that a complete treatment of these effects for all the relevant observables will be available for CLIC data analyses. A thorough study of the theoretical uncertainties associated with the different corrections outlined above has not been performed, but in general they are expected to be below the percent level, dominated by QCD scale uncertainties.",

Universal operators do contribute to top-quark physics; however, they also produce correlated effects in a variety of other processes such as di-lepton, di-boson, associated Higgs boson production, and vector boson scattering processes. Since they are expected to be probed better in these other channels, we will not consider them here. Relevant operators are instead the ones, dubbed \"top-philic\", that emerge from the direct BSM coupling to the top-quark fields q = {t L , b L } and t = t R . 2 There are valid reasons, supported by concrete BSM scenarios (see section 11 for a discussion), to expect strong new physics couplings with the top quark, and consequently enhanced top-philic operator coefficients. Top-philic effects can thus be more effective indirect probes of new physics than the universal ones, where such an enhancement might not appear.",

Operators in this class can thus be generated only in BSM scenarios with exotic flavour structures, hence they would be more conveniently studied in the context of specific flavour models. For this reason we restrict the EFT analysis presented in this paper to top-philic BSM scenarios. 4 Electroweak couplings and tt production. The operators listed in table 3 produce correlated BSM effects in all the top-related processes at CLIC that are the subject of the present paper. BSM corrections arise from modifications of the SM Feynman vertices and from new interactions that are absent in the SM. For instance, the current-current operators Q \u03d5t , Q (1) \u03d5q and Q (3) \u03d5q modify the ttZ SM vertex, but they also induce a new vertex, ttZH, that can be probed in ttH production. In contrast, the four-fermions operators Q lt,B , Q lq,B and Q lq,W only produce new interactions and do not modify the SM vertices. This illustrates well that the formalism of anomalous couplings, that only includes corrections to the SM vertices, is inadequate to parametrise the effects induced by the EFT. Thus a direct comparison of the EFT prediction with data is needed, which is the approach we followed in this study. 5 When focussing on specific processes and observables, it is in some cases possible to make partial contact between the EFT and the modified couplings approach. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt differential cross section, which will play an important role in section 8, is discussed below. Inspection of table 3 reveals that two sources of new physics effects are present. One source is due to the modified Z and photon top-quark vertices, which, in the parametrisation of [50], read",

The suppression is not perfect because of the non-negligible bquark mass; the corresponding partial widths are proportional to the square of the element V qb of the CKM-quark-mixing matrix [52,53] and to the fourth power of the ratio of the b quark and W boson masses.

These enhancements can be due to FCNC couplings at tree level, but in most models they result from contributions of new particles or from modified particle couplings at the loop level. For most BSM scenarios, significant deviations in the (light) Higgs boson couplings or contributions from additional Higgs bosons to the loop diagrams result in the significant enhancement of the t \u2192 cH decay. For the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which is one of the simplest extensions of the SM, loop contributions can be enhanced up to the level of BR \u223c 10 \u22124 [56]. For the \"non-standard\" scenarios, 2HDM(III) or \"Top 2HDM\", where one of the Higgs doublets only couples to the top quark, tree level FCNC couplings are also allowed. Here an enhancement of up to 10 \u22122 is possible [57]. BR(t \u2192 cH) could be observable at CLIC also for the Randall-Sundrum warped models or composite Higgs models with flavour violating Yukawa couplings, provided the compositeness scale is sufficiently low (below TeV scale) [55]. However, the possible observation of t \u2192 cH should then be accompanied by even more significant deviation of the measured Higgs boson couplings to the vector bosons from the SM expectations. Significant enhancement of FCNC top decays is also expected for SUSY scenarios with R-parity violation. Enhancement up to the level of 10 \u22125 is possible for both the t \u2192 cH [58] and the t \u2192 c\u03b3 decay [59].

The three channels selected for detailed study (see section 10) are: t \u2192 c\u03b3 , t \u2192 cH, and t \u2192 cE /. In the latter, a top quark decays into a c-jet and an invisible heavy scalar particle. The existence of such particles, with masses in the 100 GeV range, is still allowed in many BSM scenarios, see for example [60].",

Calorimeter clustering and particle flow reconstruction is performed using PandoraPFA [78][79][80], creating a collection of so-called -16 - Particle-Flow Objects (PFOs). Time-stamping information is used to suppress beamrelated backgrounds. To be used for further analysis, PFOs are required to have time stamps of up to between 1 and 5 ns around the reconstructed hard scattering interaction, depending on the identified particle type, p T , and detector region [4]. Three levels of timing selections are studied for each collision energy: loose, default, and tight, each applying a more stringent selection of the PFOs. In general, the more stringent selections are found to perform better for operation at higher centre-of-mass energy, where the beam backgrounds are more significant, and vice versa for operation at the initial CLIC stage. 8 The classification of candidate top-quark events as fully-hadronic, semi-leptonic, or fully-leptonic requires efficient identification of high-energy, isolated charged leptons. Lepton finding is optimised to identify e \u00b1 and \u00b5 \u00b1 originating from the decay of W bosons; 9 these leptons are typically of much higher energy than those coming from hadronic decays inside quark jets, and are well-separated from other activity in the event. Isolated leptons candidates are identified by studying their energy depositions in the ECAL and HCAL, impact parameters, and isolation in a cone around each input track. The lepton charge is determined by the curvature of the helix from a standard Kalman-filter-based track reconstruction of the associated hits in the tracking system.",

The figure is compiled using fullyhadronic tt events in CLIC at \u221a s = 3 TeV with a reconstructed collision energy above 2.6 TeV 11 and where both top-quarks, at parton-level, are located in the central region of the detector with a polar angle \u03b8 satisfying the condition 12 37 \u2022 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 143 \u2022 . It is clear from the figure that too small a jet radius does not enclose the entire top-quark decay products, leading to a significant peak close to the mass of the W boson. In contrast, larger jet radii include a growing contribution from background processes leading to a long tail in the distribution towards higher masses. The optimal jet clustering parameters, for both clustering stages, were selected as the best trade-off between achieving a narrow topquark mass peak close to the generated parton-level top-quark mass, and minimising the contributions to the mass peak at m W . In this context, we found that a jet radius of R = 0.4 and a minimum p T threshold of 5 GeV were optimal in the pre-clustering step. Similarly we found that a large-R jet radius of R = 1.4 and R = 1.0, each with \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 1.0, were optimal for operation at \u221a s = 1.4 TeV and \u221a s = 3 TeV, respectively. The right panel of figure 7 shows the reconstructed jet mass as a function of the reconstructed jet energy at \u221a s = 3 TeV, for the optimal clustering parameters in the twostep approach. Note that a cut on the reconstructed collision energy was not applied in this figure. The uppermost of the three visible yellow bands indicates top quarks that are fully captured within the large-R jet, while the lower two bands represent partially captured top quarks close to the mass of m W and m b , respectively. As expected, the large-R jet approach performs well for jets at higher energy, while the ability to capture the full top-quark jet is significantly reduced in the non-boosted regime, below \u223c 500 GeV. The resulting large-R jets serve as input for the top tagger algorithm described below.",

This tagger is explicitly designed for the identification of top quarks by recursively iterating through a jet cluster to search for up to three or four hard subjets and then imposing mass constraints on these subjets. This procedure provides strong discrimination power for hadronically decaying top quarks against QCDinduced light parton jets. Although the method was originally designed for fully-hadronic tt events in hadron colliders, in this paper it is applied to the hadronically decaying top quark in semi-leptonic tt events in CLIC, see subsection 8.4. The tagging is based on an iterative de-clustering of the input jet and is carried out by reversing each step of the jet clustering. The algorithm is governed by two parameters: \u03b4 r , the subjet distance; and \u03b4 p , the fraction of subjet p T relative to the p T of the input jet. These parameters control whether to accept the objects, resulting from the split, as subjets for further de-clustering or whether, for example, the de-clustering should continue only on the harder of the two objects. An object is rejected if its p T fraction is lower than \u03b4 p or if its distance to another object is smaller than \u03b4 r . The de-clustering loop is terminated when two successive splittings have been accepted resulting in two, three, or four subjets of the input jet. The case with two final subjets is rejected and the other cases are further analysed. The input jet is considered to be top-tagged if the total invariant mass of the subjets is within \u00b155 GeV of m t and one subjet pair has an invariant mass within \u00b130 GeV of m W .",

            "text": "The optimisation and efficiency of the top tagging algorithm was studied using fullyhadronic tt events, four-jet events qqqq (u, d, s, c, b), and dijet events qq (u, d, s, c, b). Since the background environment at a lepton collider is substantially lower than at a hadron collider, a somewhat higher rate of wrongly tagged light-quark (u, d, s, c, b) jets is acceptable and the optimisation of the algorithm is tuned to a high-efficiency operating point for the fully-hadronic tt sample; for the studies presented here we apply a benchmark efficiency of 70%. The corresponding top tagger parameters, chosen by minimising the rate of wrongly tagged light-quark jets from the four-jet sample, are \u03b4 r = 0.25 (0.11) and \u03b4 p = 0.03 (0.03), for the samples at \u221a s = 1.4 (3) TeV, respectively. Figure 8 shows the reconstructed top-quark candidate mass before and after application of the top tagger declustering step for operation at \u221a s = 1.4 TeV. A small peak close to m W is clearly seen for the tt distribution (blue) and is caused by top-quark events not fully captured by the large-R jet. The resulting tagging efficiency for top-quark jets from the \u221a s = 3 TeV tt dataset is 69% in the central region of the detector (defined as | cos \u03b8| \u2264 0.8) and with an energy in the range from 500 GeV to 1500 GeV. The corresponding efficiency for wrongly tagged light-quark jets is substantially lower: 4.4% and 8.8% for the four-jet and di-jet background samples, respectively. 13 The resulting efficiency for top-quark jets from the \u221a s = 1.4 TeV dataset is 71% in the central region of the detector (defined as | cos \u03b8| \u2264 0.8) and with an energy in the range from 400 GeV to 700 GeV. The corresponding efficiency for wrongly tagged light-quark jets is 5.7% (6.9%) for jets from the four-jet (di-jet) background sample. Figure 9 shows the top-quark tagging efficiency from the \u221a s = 3 TeV dataset as a function of the large-R jet energy (top) and polar angle \u03b8 (bottom). The dashed lines represent the distributions after the de-clustering step, while the solid lines include also the mass cuts. Note that the de-clustering step is particularly challenging in the forward region where hadrons from the larger beam-beam induced background, on top of the physics event, effectively mimic a prongy topology. As expected, the overall efficiency, including the mass cuts, drops at energies below 500 GeV where the jets are no longer sufficiently boosted to be contained within one large-R jet. The slightly lower efficiency for large jet energies is also anticipated and is mainly due to a more challenging environment for the PandoraPFA algorithm and the subjet de-clustering. Furthermore, the limited detector acceptance in the forward direction reduces the efficiency in the corresponding region significantly.  The top tagger algorithm outlined above increases the significance, estimated as S/ \u221a B where S represents the number of top-quark jets from the fully-hadronic tt sample and B the number of wrongly tagged light-quark jets from either the four-jet or dijet sample, by between 18-26% (depending on the background process and collision energy considered), compared to a simple cut on the reconstructed large-R jet mass in the corresponding range (within \u00b155 GeV of m t ). In addition, the declustering procedure provides additional handles on the jet substructure such as the mass and kinematic variables of the W boson candidate and the reconstructed helicity angle \u03b8 W that examine whether the subjets are consistent with a top decay. 14 As illustrated in section 8, these handles are useful to discriminate against the remaining background events. In conclusion, the use of dedicated JHEP11(2019)003 techniques to reconstruct boosted topologies plays an important role in the physics programme of CLIC, extending the physics reach to higher energies.",

Such a threshold scan is shown in figure 10, for two luminosity spectrum scenarios discussed below. The bands illustrate the dependence of the cross section on the generated top-quark mass and width. The error bars on the data points are statistical, taking into account signal efficiencies and background levels. The top-quark mass is extracted using a template fit to the measured cross sections as a function of centre-of-mass energy. The cross section templates are simulated for different input mass values. The top-quark width is given by the SM expectation provided by QQbar threshold, which is around 1.37 GeV for the range of masses considered here. For the calculation of the templates the width corresponding to the respective mass is used. The extraction of the mass is performed directly in the PS mass scheme.  Figure 11.

The smearing of the turn-on behaviour and the would-be 1S peak of the cross section depends on the level of beamstrahlung and the beam energy spread. A larger beam energy spread results in a more pronounced tail to lower energies while the level of beamstrahlung influences the behaviour in the resonance region and above, reducing the effective cross section. Both of these effects result in a broadening of the threshold curve. This in turn reduces the statistical sensitivity of a mass measurement for a given total integrated luminosity, and degrades the precision for the combined extraction of several top-quark properties, such as mass and width or mass and Yukawa coupling. The beam energy spread and the level of beamstrahlung can be tuned by modifying the bunch charge and the beam focusing, allowing optimisation of the spectrum specifically for a top-quark threshold scan. This illustrates well the flexibility of CLIC to optimise the luminosity spectrum without physically changing the accelerator. This aspect might also be useful for other physics applications such potential threshold scans for newly discovered particles. However, an improvement of the quality of the luminosity spectrum also results in a reduction of the instantaneous luminosity. Figure 11 shows the effects of ISR only, and of ISR and the luminosity spectrum combined on the top-quark pair production cross section. Here, two scenarios for the luminosity spectrum at the threshold are considered: one based on the nominal accelerator parameters optimised for luminosity (denoted \"nominal luminosity spectrum\"), and one with a reduced beam energy spread and correspondingly a narrower and more pronounced main luminosity peak, using a bunch charge reduced to 90% of the nominal charge (denoted 'reduced charge' luminosity spectrum) [91]. For the latter scenario, the instantaneous luminosity is reduced by 24% compared to the nominal parameters, resulting in a 31% increase of the required running time for a 100 fb \u22121 threshold scan.

This conclusion changes when extending the analysis to other parameters such as the top-quark width or Yukawa coupling.

The combined theoretical and parametric uncertainties are expected to be in the range 30 MeV to 50 MeV, depending on assumptions on the expected improvement in the theoretical description and the knowledge of input parameters such as the strong coupling constant. They have been evaluated for CLIC in the context of the different scenarios for the luminosity spectrum. The results are summarised in table 5. Similarly, the combined experimental systematic uncertainties are expected to be around 25 MeV to 50 MeV. The beam energy is expected to be known with a relative uncertainty of approximately 10 \u22124 , both from machine parameter measurements and from detector measurements of the luminosity spectrum peak from Bhabha scattering, where the momentum scale can be calibrated using Z boson decays with sufficient accuracy. The precision of the measurement of the total luminosity, which has a direct impact on the precision of the cross section measurement used to extract the top quark mass, is expected to be in the few per mille range [100,101]. This results in an uncertainty on the top-quark mass of a few MeV, substantially smaller than other uncertainties considered here. As discussed above, the luminosity spectrum plays an important role in the analysis of a threshold scan, so the uncertainties of the knowledge of the spectrum are highly relevant. The studies discussed in [92] make use of a study scaled from 3 TeV [10]. A dedicated study for the 380 GeV case has recently been performed in the context of the analysis discussed in section 7.2, which will be used in the future to further refine the uncertainty estimate for a threshold scan.",

These scales correspond to the top-quark mass, top-quark 3-momentum, and kinetic energy of the tt system, respectively. These parameters are varied in the intervals given in table 6 and the corresponding cross-section distributions are generated, folded with the CLIC luminosity spectrum, and fitted using the nominal distribution with the MS mass m t (m t ) as a free parameter.

The use of the mass ratio instead of the W mass constraint is motivated by the correlation between the reconstructed masses of the W boson and the parent top quark.

The extra information contained in such observables can improve the sensitivity to certain EFT operators. For example, the corrections induced by anomalous dipole moment operators (i.e., Q tB and Q tW in table 3) to the distribution of the azimuthal decay angle of the top quark grow with energy, while the corresponding effects on \u03c3 tt and A FB are essentially energy-independent [118]. 16 To best exploit these and other differential features of the signal a multivariate statistical framework is required.

A large value would indicate that the jets have a large fraction of their energy distributed away from the candidate subjet directions, i.e. that it has at least N + 1 subjets. A key step for defining N-subjettiness is to make an appropriate choice of the candidate subjets. In this analysis they are produced by reclustering the large-R jets into J exclusive jets (k t algorithm, R = 0.3). The analysis studied several ratios \u03c4 N +1 /\u03c4 N for both the hadronically and leptonically decaying top quark. The N-subjettiness ratio \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 for the leptonically decaying large-R jet is shown to the left of figure 18. This variable is used to distinguish the b-quark of the leptonic top-quark decay from jets with a multi-pronged sub-structure as present in some of the background processes considered. The distributions are shown after both pre-selection and quality cuts and are normalised to unity.",

This analysis is used as an example because the statistical uncertainties are generally lower at \u221a s = 1.4 TeV than at \u221a s = 3 TeV. Further, events with signifiant energy loss due to ISR and beamstrahlung, as studied in this analysis, are potentially more likely to be sensitive to systematic uncertainties as background rejection is more challenging. In this sense, systematic effects estimated for the radiative event analysis can be considered as conservative estimates for the other analyses.

A particularly important role in this context is played by VBF production initiated by longitudinally polarised vector bosons, which are effectively equivalent to the Higgs field at high energy, owing to the Equivalence Theorem. In several new physics scenarios aimed at addressing the Naturalness problem, the Higgs boson and the top-quark interactions are largely modified, hence it is natural to study processes that are directly sensitive to such interactions.

The vector coefficient of the tensor tc\u03b3 coupling was tuned to obtain BR(t \u2192 c\u03b3 ) = 10 \u22123 . This ensures that the contribution from the FCNC decay to the total top-quark width as well as the possibility of having two FCNC decays in the same event are negligible. The same BR value is also used when comparing signal and background event distributions. This choice is arbitrary and has no influence on the expected exclusion limits. Either the top or the anti-top quark (referred to as the \"signal top quark\" in the following) decays via the FCNC channel, and the other (denoted the \"spectator top quark\") via the standard hadronic or leptonic decay. The FCNC decay channel t \u2192 c\u03b3 is characterised by the presence of a high-energy photon, with an energy between about 50 GeV and 140 GeV, resulting from the decay kinematics at \u221a s = 380 GeV (see figure 26). This gives a very clear signature, allowing for efficient separation of signal events from possible backgrounds. The analysis only considers the fully-hadronic decay channel where the spectator top quark decays into a b-quark and a W boson, the latter decaying hadronically. With the signal top quark decaying to a c-quark and a photon, the target events should contain a high-energy photon and a c-quark jet as well as one b-quark jet and two jets from the W decay of the spectator top quark. The background sample considered consists of e + e \u2212 events compatible with top-quark pair production (6-fermion sample), four-fermion production events (dominated by W + W \u2212 contribution) and pair production of quarks other than the top quark.

Jets are reconstructed using the VLC algorithm in exclusive mode with a radius of 1.6 and \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 0.8. For each hypothesis, all the possible jet combinations are considered, and the configuration that minimises a \u03c7 2 value for the event is chosen. The \u03c7 2 formula includes constraints on the invariant masses of the two reconstructed top-quark candidates and one (for signal hypothesis) or two (for background hypothesis) reconstructed W bosons. The discrimination of background events from signal events is based on a multivariate classifier analysis using a BDT approach with 42 input variables. The variables giving the largest impact on the classifier response include the photon properties, reconstructed invariant mass of the signal top quark, reconstructed b and c jet energies and the total energy of the event, flavour tagging results and the ratio of \u03c7 2 values for the signal and background hypotheses. The resulting distributions of the BDT classifier response for the signal and background (SM top-quark decays plus other SM processes) samples are shown in figure 27. Although there is a significant overlap of the two distributions, an almost clean sample of signal events can be selected by imposing a tight cut on the BDT response. This is illustrated in figure 28, where the reconstructed invariant mass distribution for the signal top-quark decays is shown after imposing a BDT response cut, BDT score > 0.29 (corresponding to the highest signal significance for the test scenario with BR(t \u2192 c\u03b3 ) = 10 \u22123 ). With this cut, 28% of the signal events are selected while the background contributions are reduced by three to five orders of magnitude. The total selection efficiency for signal events is 26%.

The expected sensitivities and the covariance matrix in the EFT parameter space are obtained, for simplicity, by asymptotic formulas that rely on the same LO expression.

Correlation matrices are displayed for the fits using the statistically optimal observables. In conclusion, we find that operation at high energy dramatically improves the sensitivity to the four-fermion operators Q lq,B , Q lq,W , and Q lt,B , and to a lesser extent, to Q tB and Q tW . This is due to the fact that the four-fermion operators give a contribution to the amplitude that grows quadratically with the centre--  of-mass energy as explained in subsection 4.4. The contributions to the amplitude of the operators Q tB and Q tW also grow with energy, but only linearly, and so the improvement is less significant. The sensitivity to the four-fermion operators improves by more than one order of magnitude with the high-energy stages. By combining the sensitivities to the seven Wilson coefficients and the correlations among them, one can reconstruct the likelihood and use it for a rigorous reinterpretation of the result in explicit BSM scenarios where theoretical correlations are present among the operator coefficients. This is done for two top-quark compositeness scenarios as presented in subsection 11.2.",

As demonstrated in the individual analysis sections of section 8, the background levels are small compared to the signals; for technical reasons we have neglected both systematics and contributions to the statistical uncertainty from backgrounds in the following EFT studies. The resulting global and individual 1\u03c3 constraints on the seven Wilson coefficients obtained for CLIC operation at \u221a s = 380 GeV and \u221a s = 1.4 TeV are presented in orange in figure 33. Note that the reach of the initial CLIC stage alone does not allow for the simultaneous determination of the seven Wilson coefficients. While the global reach is illustrated in bars, the corresponding single-operator sensitivities are shown as ticks of the same colour. The sensitivities are measured in TeV \u22122 on the lower horizontal axis (and reported in numbers of the same unit), while the upper horizontal axis reports the sensitivity to the operator scale \u039b \u2261 1/ \u221a C.Figure 34shows the sensitivity of CLIC when also including the results at the highest energy stage with collisions at \u221a s = 3 TeV.These observables alone provide an excellent reach, but are insufficient to simultaneously constrain all the directions in the seven-dimensional EFT parameter space and leave a number of flat (poorly constrained) directions in the likelihood.
