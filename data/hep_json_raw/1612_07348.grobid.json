Reaching such low systematics goals will require control of all systematics, including those from neutrino interaction cross sections, flux and detector response.",

Those studies are currently being expanded to measurements double-different cross sections with respect to muon transverse and longitudinal momentum. A preliminary version of the antineutrino measurement is shown in Figure 3, with MINER\u03bdA data indicating significant additional strength at moderate transverse momentum when compared to the GENIE [6] event generator. Quasi-elastic and quasi-elastic final states have also been studied through a measurement of inclusive charged-current scattering with low recoil energy. Results of this analysis are reported in [7] and shown in figure 4. Significant discrepancies with GENIE models with and without two-particle, two-hole additions are found in regions of moderate energy. The excess in this inclusive neutrino analysis appears in a similar kinematic region to the exclusive antineutrino quasi-elastic analysis discussed above.",

In the sideband between 2.2 and 3.5 GeV, an excess beyond the Monte Carlo prediction is observed consistent with two overlapping minimum ionizing particles. This excess of events has been studied and found to have a signature that is similar to coherent pion production, in that the electromagnetic showers are very forward, and there is little other energy present in the event. However, when considering energy in a cone extending upstream from the shower vertex, these excess events contain significantly more energy than that simulated coherent events. This energy is consistent with diffractive pion production from Hydrogen, a process that is not simulated in GENIE. Figure 6.
