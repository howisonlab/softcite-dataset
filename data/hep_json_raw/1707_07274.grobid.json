            "text": "The standard model (SM) has been extremely successful in describing particle physics phenomena. Nevertheless, it suffers from shortcomings such as the hierarchy problem [1], the need for a fine-tuned cancellation of large quantum corrections to the Higgs mass to maintain a physical value at the observed electroweak scale. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] postulates a symmetry between bosons and fermions and provides a \"natural\" solution to the hierarchy problem through the cancellation of quadratic divergences in particle and SUSY particle loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass. In natural SUSY models, light top and bottom squarks are preferred with masses close to the electroweak scale [1,10]. In R-parity conserving SUSY models [11], SUSY particles are created in pairs, and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable. The LSP is assumed here to be the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ), which is both weakly interacting and stable and therefore has the properties of a dark matter candidate [12].",

The new methods and discriminators, as well as the increase in integrated luminosity, lead to considerably improved sensitivity relative to previous searches.

Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

The jet energy is corrected for the contribution from pileup based on the jet area method [48]. Additional corrections to the jet energy scale are applied to compensate for variations in detector response [49]. Jets are required to have p T greater than 25 GeV and to be contained within the tracker volume, |\u03b7| < 2.4. The momentum imbalance vector ( p miss T ) is calculated as the negative vector sum of transverse momenta of all PF candidates reconstructed in an event, and its magnitude is referred to as missing transverse momentum, denoted p miss T [50]. Muons are reconstructed by combining the information from the silicon tracker and the muon detectors in a global fit. An identification selection is performed using the quality of the geometrical matching between the tracker and the muon system measurements [51]. Electron candidates are reconstructed by matching clusters of energy deposited in the ECAL to reconstructed tracks. Selection criteria based on the distribution of the shower shape, track cluster matching, and consistency between the cluster energy and track momentum are then used in the identification of electron candidates [52]. Muon and electron candidates are required to have p T > 10 GeV, to be within |\u03b7| < 2.4, and to originate from within 2 mm of the beam axis in the transverse plane. Relative lepton isolation, I rel , is quantified as the sum of the p T of PF candidates within a cone R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 around the lepton (where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in radians), divided by the lepton p T . The lepton itself and charged PF candidates not originating from the PV are not considered in the sum. The isolation sum is corrected for effects of pileup interactions through an area-based estimate [53] of the pileup energy deposited in the cone. The size of the cone is defined according to lepton p T , as follows:",

As c-jet properties are often distributed in between those of b-and light-jets, the charm tagger discriminators are less efficient than b-tagger and usually suffers from large misidentification rates.

            "text": "For the very compressed spectra (m b 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 < 25 GeV), a large fraction of events contain b quarks with p T < 25 GeV, which may fail to pass the jet selection or the b tagging working points. We therefore extend the identification of b quarks based on the presence of a secondary vertex (SV) reconstructed using the inclusive vertex finder (IVF) algorithm [57]. To suppress the background originating from light-flavour jets, the following requirements are placed on the SV observables: the distance in the transverse plane between the SV and PV must be <3 cm; there must be >2 tracks associated with the SV; the significance of this distance is required to be >4; the cosine of the pointing angle, which is defined through the scalar product between the distance vector ( \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SV, PV) and the p SV direction has to be >0.98, where p SV is the total three-momentum of the tracks associated with the SV. Finally, in order to avoid overlaps with the b and c tagging selections described above, the distance R of the SV to jets (including b-or c-tagged jets) has to be >0.4, and the transverse component of p SV is required to satisfy p SV < 25 GeV. The method has 20% efficiency in identifying b hadrons versus less than one percent of misidentification and the performance in simulation agrees with the performance with data within 16% [58]. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of events is used to study the properties of SM backgrounds and signal models. The Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 generator [59] is used in leading-order (LO) mode to simulate events originating from tt, W+jets, Z+jets, and quantum chromodynamics multijet processes ('QCD'), as well as signal events, based on LO NNPDF3.0 [60] parton distribution functions (PDFs). The LO MC is used for these SM processes because it allows a better control of the associated jet production to large multiplicities, while any next-to-leading order (NLO) MC would only model the first radiation at NLO and then use parton shower for extra jets. Single top quark events produced in the tW channel are generated at NLO with Powheg v2 [61][62][63][64], while SM processes such as WZ, ZZ, WW, ttZ, and ttW, which are grouped together as the rare processes because of the small contribution in this analysis, are generated at NLO using the MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 program, using NLO NNPDF3.0 PDFs. Parton showering and hadronization is generated using Pythia8.212 [65]. The response of the CMS detector for the SM backgrounds is simulated with the Geant4 [66] package. The CMS fast simulation package [67] is used to simulate all signal samples, and is verified to provide results that are consistent with those obtained from the full Geant4-based simulation. Any residual differences in the detector response description between the Geant4 and fast simulation are corrected for, with corresponding uncertainties in the signal acceptance taken into account. Event reconstruction is performed in the same manner as for collision data. A distribution of pileup interactions is used when producing the simulated samples. The samples are then reweighted to match the pileup profile observed in the collected data. The signal production cross sections are calculated using NLO with next-toleading logarithm (NLL) soft-gluon resummation calculations [68]. The most precise cross section calculations are used to normalize the SM simulated samples, corresponding most often to next-tonext-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy.",

It is computed for each N b-tags , N c-tags , and N SV category separately, with an inclusive selection in the kinematic variables M CT , p miss T , and H T to improve statistical precision. The term S data/MC is a shape correction factor that accounts for possible differences in the shape of the kinematic variables used to define the signal regions. To compensate for the low event count due to the low branching fraction of the Z boson to dilepton final states, relaxed heavy flavor tagging requirements are used to compute the shape corrections. In the noncompressed region, jets are b tagged using a loose working point, while in the compressed region an inclusive N b-tags , N c-tags , and N SV selec-tion is used. The shape correction factors in the noncompressed region are determined via comparison of the M CT distribution in Z \u2192 + \u2212 events in simulation and data. To do the comparison, we first normalize the simulation to the number of observed events in data after applying the loose selection criteria. The small contamination from tt, W+jets, single top quark and rare processes is estimated using simulation and subtracted from data. The size of shape corrections in the noncompressed region varies between 3 to 20% from lowest to highest M CT bin. After applying the shape correction factor in bins of M CT and similar selections as in the search regions, good agreement between the data and simulation is found as a function of p miss T and H T . In the given H T bin, the small residual difference in the H T distribution is considered as a systematic uncertainty.

            "text": "The dominant systematic uncertainties on the signal yield predictions are: the luminosity determination (2.5%) [72], the signal acceptance and efficiency arising from the jet energy corrections (5%); renormalization and factorization scale (5%); ISR modelling (5-20%); trigger efficiency (2%); b and c tagging efficiency (5-30%); and selected SV efficiency (16-50%). The uncertainty of 16% is considered if the selected SV is matched to b hadrons, and it is doubled if the selected SV is matched to c hadrons. Finally, a 50% uncertainty in the selected SV efficiency is applied, if it is not matched to either b or c hadrons. However, due to the small misidentification rate (\u223c1%) the considered 50% uncertainty has a negligible effect on final limits. The statistical uncertainty due to the limited size of the simulated samples, calculated for each signal model, varies from a few percent to 100% and is not correlated with signal systematic uncertainties. While the uncertainties in the b-and c-tagged jet and lepton efficiency corrections in simulation are correlated between different processes and search bins, the uncertainties in transfer factors are treated as fully uncorrelated. For the signal, all systematic uncertainties are correlated between the different search regions. We improve the modelling of ISR jets, which affects the total transverse momentum (p T (ISR)) of the system of SUSY particles, by reweighting the p T (ISR) distribution of signal events. This reweighting procedure is based on studies of the transverse momentum of Z events  ",
