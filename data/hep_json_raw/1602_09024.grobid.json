This analysis is performed in the tt decay channels with one isolated, high transverse momentum electron or muon and at least four jets, at least one of which is required to be identified as originating from hadronization of a b quark. The calibration of the jet energy scale and the efficiency of b jet identification are determined from data. The measured tt cross section is 228.5 \u00b1 3.8 (stat) \u00b1 13.7 (syst) \u00b1 6.0 (lumi) pb. This measurement is compared with an analysis of 7 TeV data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 , to determine the ratio of 8 TeV to 7 TeV cross sections, which is found to be 1.43 \u00b1 0.04 (stat) \u00b1 0.07 (syst) \u00b1 0.05 (lumi). The measurements are in agreement with QCD predictions up to next-to-next-to-leading order.",

The predicted top quark pair production cross section (\u03c3 tt ) in proton-proton (pp) collisions, at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, is 253 pb, with theoretical uncertainties at the level of 5-6%. A precise measurement of \u03c3 tt is an important test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high energies. Furthermore, precision tt cross section measurements can be used to constrain the top quark mass m t and QCD parameters, such as the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S [1], or the parton distribution functions (PDF) of the proton [2].",

            "text": "The tt production cross section was measured at the LHC at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. In this paper, a measurement of the tt production cross section in the final state with one high transverse momentum lepton (muon or electron) e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch and jets is presented using the 2012 data set at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb \u22121 . To measure the cross section ratio, where several systematic uncertainties cancel, the 2011 data set at \u221a s = 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 , has been concurrently analyzed with a similar strategy to the one developed for the cross section measurement at 8 TeV. The new measurement agrees very well with the previously published CMS result [8]. The larger statistical uncertainty of the present measurement with respect to the previous one is due to the simultaneous determination of the b tagging efficiency, as discussed in Sect. 6. Similarly to the 8 TeV analysis, an additional signal modelling uncertainty has been considered in the 7 TeV analysis, as reported in Sect. 6. In the standard model, top quarks are predominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction and decay almost exclusively into a W boson and a b quark. The event signature is determined by the subsequent decays of the two W bosons. This analysis uses lepton+jets decays into muons or electrons, where one of the W bosons decays into two quarks and the other to a lepton and a neutrino. Decays of the W boson into a tau lepton and a neutrino can enter the selection if the tau lepton decays leptonically. The top quark decaying into a b quark and a leptonically decaying W boson is defined in the following as the \"leptonic top quark\", while the other top quark is referred to as \"hadronic top quark\". For the tt signal two jets result from the hadronization of the b and b quarks (b jets), thus b tagging algorithms are employed for the identification of b jets in order to improve the purity of the tt candidate sample.",

The powheg generator implements matrix elements to next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD, with up to one additional jet. The mass of the top quark is set to 172.5 GeV. The CT10 [36] PDF set is used by powheg and the CTEQ6M [37][38][39] by MadGraph. The pythia (v.6.426) [40] and herwig (v.6.520) [41] generators are used to model the parton showering. The pythia shower matching is done using the MLM prescription [42,43].",

Drell-Yan production of charged leptons is generated for dilepton invariant masses above 50 GeV, as those events constitute the relevant background in the phase space of this analysis.

The \u03b1 calibration values are individually determined for nominal conditions and for each of the variations related to JES and JER. In addition to the selection described in Sect. 4, two btagged jets are required in order to increase the signal purity. The mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is reconstructed as the dijet invariant mass from all combinations of non b-tagged jets. The dijet invariant mass distributions are fitted in data and in simulation with a function describing the W boson signal peak and the dijet combinatorial background. The \u03b1 values are determined as the ratios of the fitted W boson masses in data and in simulation. In the M b analysis \u03b1 = 1.011 \u00b1 0.004 is obtained with the nominal samples both in the muon and electron channels, with variations of the order of \u00b11.5% for the samples with down and up varia-  tions of the JES. The same values are determined by the M 3 analysis. This additional calibration reduces the size of the JES systematic uncertainty by approximately 60%. The JES uncertainty, reported in Table 3,  Uncertainties from the b tagging efficiency and mistag rate are evaluated in the M 3 analysis by varying the correction factors within their uncertainties [26,27] quoted in Sect. 8. In the M b analysis, on the other hand, the b tagging efficiency for b jets is measured from data, using the technique described in Refs. [26][27][28], on the same selected event sample as that for the cross section determination, but before b tagging. The M b variable is used not only as a cross section estimator, but also as a b tagging discriminator. The statistical and sys-tematic uncertainties in the b tagging and mistag efficiencies are propagated to the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the cross section measurements. For this reason the statistical uncertainty obtained by the M b analysis is larger than the one of the M 3 analysis. A systematic uncertainty is assigned to the choice, based on simulation, of the b-enriched (for M b values below 140 GeV) and of the b-depleted (for M b in the range 140-240 GeV) regions, by shifting the windows by \u00b130 GeV. Since the b tagging efficiency and mistag rate are derived from data and since they are re-determined when evaluating the effect of the various systematic uncertainties, no additional uncertainties are included. The method is shown [26][27][28] to be stable for different b tagging algorithms and working points.",

At least four jets are required within |\u03b7| < 2.5 and with p T > 50, 40, 30, and 30 GeV in the muon channel, and p T > 50, 45, 35, and 30 GeV in the electron channel. Slightly tighter p T selection criteria are applied in the electron channel because of the larger multijet background. Muons are required to have transverse momentum larger than 26 GeV. In the muon channel no explicit requirement is applied on the missing energy in the transverse plane, while E miss T has to be larger than 20 GeV in the electron channel.",

The data sample is selected such that it is rich in multijet background and poor in tt signal and in other processes such as W+jets.

The tt, single top quark, W+jets, and Z+jets templates, used in the likelihood maximization, are taken from simulation, while the multijet template is estimated from data as described above. Because of the similarity between the single top quark and the tt templates, the single top quark contribution is constrained by a Gaussian distribution of 30% width to its expected value. The choice of the constraint has a negligible effect on the final result. The normalization of the signal and background processes, including the multijet background, is determined by the fit itself.

Details of the individual contributions are explained in [61].The impact of the jet energy resolution (JER) is estimated by applying \u03b7-dependent variations with an average of \u00b110%. The JES and JER variations are propagated to the E miss T . In addition, the contribution to E miss T arising from energy depositions not contained in jets is varied by \u00b110% [60]. The uncertainty related to the pileup modelling is determined by propagating a \u00b15% variation [62] to the central value of the inelastic cross section. Variations in the composition of the main background processes, W+jets and Z+jets, are conservatively evaluated by varying independently their cross sections by \u00b130%[63][64][65]. Additional uncertainties on the heavy flavour component in W/Z+jets production are not explicitly taken into account and are assumed to be covered by the 30% uncertainty. The variation of the normalization of the single top quark background by 30% gives a negligible contribution. The trigger efficiency and lepton identification correction factors are determined with a tag-and-probe method[57]  in dilepton events and are varied within their p T -and \u03b7-dependent uncertainties.",
