However, datasets with large missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) can generically search for invisible particle production and therefore provide constraints on such models. We apply data from the ATLAS mono-jet (jet+E miss T ) and vector-boson-fusion (forward jets and E miss T ) searches to such models. In all cases experimental limits are at least five times weaker than theoretical predictions.",

In particular, the lightest SUSY particle (LSP, also denoted as \u03c7 0 1 ) is a prototypical candidate for 'weakly interacting massive particle' (WIMP) dark matter. Conventional searches for SUSY require that the mass splitting between the invisible LSP and the next-tolightest SUSY particle is large enough to produce a visible probe, such as a charged lepton. However, many interesting SUSY models have a splitting which is very small, known as compressed spectra, to which these limits do not apply.",

To obtain a realistic dark matter candidate, one must typically balance the large annihilation rates of the Higgsinos (h u,d ) or SU(2) gauginos (winos) against the small annihilation rates of the hypercharge gaugino (the bino, B) to yield the correct dark matter relic abundance through thermal freeze-out; this tuning of admixtures is called a 'well-tempered neutralino' [3]. This scenario is naturally associated with a compressed spectrum. In the case of a bino-Higgsino LSP, the tuning of theB andh u,d masses typically gives a splitting between the LSP and the next-lightest states of O(M Z ).",

As remarked above, there is a qualitative difference depending on which condition is more closely met: either the LSP is very well mixed betweenB andh + or it is a pureh + state 2 , depending on which of M 1 or |\u00b5| is smaller. As noted, this has a small effect on the relic abundance since this is well-tempered through coannihilations with the nearly-degenerate states. This also affects the specific couplings of the electroweakinos at colliders, though we do not expect this to affect the searches we present here. The assumed decoupling of the CP-odd Higgs avoids the most stringent bounds flavor-changing neutral currents such as B s \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 [35] that are typically connected to Bino-Higgsino dark matter.",

This assumption is tied to the naturalness of the MSSM. In the absence of new physics, it is perhaps useful to relax any bias about the form of naturalness and instead search more broadly. This approach has recently been advocated in [36][37][38] where it is pointed out that the low-tan \u03b2 regime re-opens for decoupled scalar superpartersthe limit we take here. The tan \u03b2 \u223c few limit is qualitatively similar and relaxes the lower limit on M S .",
