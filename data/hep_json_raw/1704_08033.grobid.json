            "text": "The spectroscopy of charmonium states below the open charm threshold is well established, but the situation above the threshold is more complicated. From the inclusive hadronic cross section in e + e \u2212 annihilation, some vector charmonium states, \u03c8(3770), \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), \u03c8(4415) are known with properties as expected in the quark model [1]. However, besides these states, several new vector states, namely the Y(4260), Y(4360) and Y(4660), have been discovered experimentally [2][3][4][5][6][7]. In addition, some new states with other quantum number configurations are also found in experiment, such as the X(3872), Z c (3900) and Z c (4020) states [5,[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. The common properties of these states are their relatively narrow width for decaying into a pair of charmed mesons, and their strong coupling to hidden charm final states. Therefore, it is hard to explain all these resonances as charmonia and they are named 'charmonium-like states' collectively. Several unconventional explanations, such as hybrid charmonium [17][18][19], tetraquark [20][21][22], hadronic molecule [23][24][25], diquarks [26,27] or kinematical effects [28][29][30][31] have been suggested.

            "text": "To understand the nature of these charmonium-like states, it is mandatory to investigate both open and hidden charm decays. Most of the observed vector charmonium-like states transit to spin-triplet charmonium states with large rate since the spin alignment of the c andc-quarks does not need to be changed between initial and final states. However, the spin-flip process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0h c has also been observed by the CLEO [34] and BESIII experiments [13,15,35], and the large cross section exceeds theoretical expectations [36]. Furthermore, two new structures have been reported in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [35]. This may suggest the existence of hybrid charmonium states with a pair of cc in spin-singlet configuration which easily couples to an h c final state. Consequently, searching for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7h c will provide more information about the spin-flip transition, and the structures observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0h c may be observed also in the \u03b7h c process. In addition, the transition \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03b7h b has been observed in the bottomonium system [37]. The analogous process in the charmonium system is worth searching for to understand the dynamics in the \u03b7 transition between heavy quarkonia.",

Since the E1 photon energy distribution in the laboratory frame will broaden with increasing c.m. energy, the energy window requirement is enlarged to (350, 650) MeV for the data sets collected at \u221a s > 4.416 GeV. The \u03b7 c candidate is reconstructed by the hadronic systems determined by the corresponding decay mode. The invariant mass of the hadronic systems is required to be within the mass range of (2940, 3020) MeV/c 2 . For the selected candidates, we apply a fit to the distribution of the \u03b7 recoil mass to obtain the signal yield. Charged tracks in BESIII are reconstructed from MDC hits within a fiducial range of | cos \u03b8| < 0.93, where \u03b8 is the polar angle of the track. We require that the point of closest approach (POCA) to the interaction point (IP) is within 10 cm in the beam direction and within 1 cm in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction. A vertex fit constrains the production vertex, which is determined run by run, and all the charged tracks to a common vertex. Since the K 0 S has a relatively long lifetime, it will travel a certain distance in the detector to the point where it decays into daughter particles. The requirements on the track POCA and the vertex fit mentioned above are therefore not applied to its daughter particles. The TOF and dE/dx information are combined to form PID confidence levels (C.L.) for the pion, kaon, and proton hypotheses; both PID and kinematic fit information is used to determine the particle type of each charged track, as discussed below.",
