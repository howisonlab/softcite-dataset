            "text": "The main goal of experiments with the SND detector [1] at the e + e \u2212 collider VEPP-2000 [2] is a precision measurement of the total cross section of e + e \u2212 annihilation to the hadrons in the center-of-mass (c.m.) energy region E = \u221a s < 2 GeV. The total cross section is necessary for calculation of the running electromagnetic coupling constant and the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Below 2 GeV the total hadronic cross section is calculated as a sum of exclusive cross sections for all possible hadronic modes. For some of them, e.g., \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7, which may give a sizable contribution to the total hadronic cross section, experimental information is scarce or absent. The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 can proceed through the \u03c9\u03b7, \u03c6\u03b7 intermediate states, the cross sections for which are already measured [3][4][5], and also through other states, e.g., \u03c1a 0 (980). This work is dedicated to the measurement of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7 cross section. We analyze the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 final state with \u03b7 meson decayed to \u03b3\u03b3. The methods developed for the selection of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 events will be used in future detailed study of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 and measurement its total cross section.",

The spectrum is fitted with a sum of signal and background distributions. The background distribution is obtained using simulation of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . A possible background simulation inaccuracy is taken into account by introducing a scale factor \u03b1 4\u03c0 . For energies below 1.594 GeV, the value of \u03b1 4\u03c0 found in the fit is consistent with unity. At higher energies, there is significant background contribution from other processes, e.g., e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . In this region \u03b1 4\u03c0 is fixed to unity, and a linear function is added to describe contribution of other background processes. It is worth to note that in the energy region above 1.594 GeV the shape of the M \u03b7 distribution for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events is close to linear.",

The obtained cross section data are the most accurate to date. Above 1.6 GeV they disagree with previous BABAR measurements [3]. The measured cross section is well fitted by a sum of two resonance contributions, from the \u03c9(1420) and from an effective resonance describing the \u03c9(1650) and \u03c6(1680) contributions. The fitted \u03c9(1420) amplitude is small, but necessary to describe the asymmetry of the peak in the measured cross section.",
