The proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment from 2015 to 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 . Events containing three isolated charged leptons (electrons or muons) and two or three jets, one of which is identified as containing a b-hadron, are selected. The main backgrounds are from ttZ and diboson production. Neural networks are used to improve the background rejection and extract the signal. The measured cross-section for t + \u2212 q production, including nonresonant dilepton pairs with m + \u2212 > 30 GeV, is 97 \u00b1 13 (stat.) \u00b1 7 (syst.) fb, consistent with the Standard Model prediction.",

The final state is where the Z boson decays into electrons or muons, and the W boson, from the top-quark decay, decays into an electron or muon and an associated neutrino, and also includes the contribution from \u03c4 -lepton decays into electrons or muons. The requirement of three leptons in the final state maximises the signal significance relative to the backgrounds. Evidence for this process has previously been reported by the ATLAS collaboration [1] with a significance of 4.2 standard deviations using data collected in 2015 and 2016. The CMS collaboration [2] reported an observation with a measured cross-section uncertainty of 15% using data collected in 2016 and 2017.",

The main LO Feynman -1 -JHEP07(2020)124 diagram is the same as in t-channel single top-quark production with the addition of a Z boson radiated from any of the quarks (figure 1a) or from the t-channel W -boson propagator (figure 1b). This allows the t-Z and the W -Z couplings to be indirectly studied in a single interaction. At LO the ttZ process is O(\u03b1 2 s ) in QCD, and the extraction of the t-Z coupling is more sensitive to higher-order QCD corrections. Furthermore, for the tZq process the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections are small and therefore deviations from the SM can easily be studied in the framework of the SM effective field theory [3].",

For lower parton radiation, the nominal h damp value was used, while the renormalisation and factorisation scales were increased by a factor of two and the \"Var3c\" down variation was selected in the parton shower. To study the impact of using an alternative parton shower and hadronisation model, a sample was produced with the Powheg-Box v2 generator interfaced to Herwig 7.0.4 [33,34], the former using the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set and the latter using the H7UE set of tuned parameters [34] and the MMHT2014 LO PDF set [35]. To assess the uncertainty due to the choice of matching scheme, a sample generated by MadGraph5 aMC@NLO 2.6.0 with the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set was passed through Pythia 8.230, which used the A14 tune and NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set.

Candidate b-jets must have a b-tagging discriminant value that exceeds a threshold such that a 70% b-jet selection efficiency is achieved in simulated tt events. With this criterion, the misidentification rate for light-jets, i.e. jets containing neither a b-nor a c-hadron, is 0.3%, while it is 11% for jets initiated by c-quarks.

Generated events are used for tt + tW and Z + jets independently, with a preselection of two leptons instead of three leptons and two b-jets. One of the two b-jets, which is selected at random, is replaced by a lepton. The energy and polar angle of the replacement lepton, relative to the direction of the b-jet momentum, are derived from a generator-level study of the polar-angle distribution versus lepton energy in the rest frame of the b-hadron, which is assumed to carry the b-jet energy. The azimuthal angle is generated uniformly around the b-jet direction. The lepton four-momenta are transformed to the laboratory frame using the b-jet four-momenta. If the b-jet is within a cone of \u2206R = 0.4 around the lepton, the b-jet is removed. In the other events the b-jet is kept and the event will ultimately not satisfy the common selection, as it contains two b-jets. The distributions of kinematic variables from the resulting sample are compared with those from the tt + tW and Z + jets MC samples, applying the common selection, and are found to agree within statistical uncertainties.",
