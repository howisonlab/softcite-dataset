The focus is on the contributions to W + jets processes from real W emission, which is achieved by studying events where a muon is observed close to a high transverse momentum jet. At small angular separations, these contributions are expected to be large. Various theoretical models of this process are compared to the data in terms of the absolute cross-section and the angular distributions of the muon from the leptonic W decay.",

In leading-order (LO) calculations of W + 1-jet production, the W boson is balanced by the recoil hadronic jet, often referred to as back-to-back production. At next-to-leading order (NLO), QCD and EW corrections to W + 1-jet processes appear, both as real and virtual contributions. In the case of real W boson emission from an initial-or final-state quark, these contributions scale as O \u03b1 ln 2 p T, j /m W , where \u03b1 is the gauge coupling of the unified EW theory, p T, j is the transverse momentum of the jet and m W is the W boson mass, and have a collinear enhancement in the distribution of the angular distance between the W boson and the closest jet.

The procedures to correctly account for collinear parton radiation, such as massless gluon emission, are well known and led to the introduction of (Sudakov) parton showering of the initial-and final-state partons in Monte Carlo generators for QCD as well as quantum electrodynamics (QED) contributions. An analogous procedure is available for the emission of real W bosons [6]. The effect of real W boson emission can be probed by isolating events for which the cancellation between real and virtual corrections is incomplete, for example by studying the region of small angular separation between a jet and the W boson. This region also contains LO contributions from W + 2-jets, as well as corrections to that process, which must be included for accurate predictions.",

The measurements presented here focus on events that contain a muon and a jet with transverse momentum p T > 500 GeV.

Real W boson emission, also termed collinear W production, is the dominant process for events with R < 2.4, and thus R < 2.4 is referred to as the collinear region. The significance of this higher-order contribution at small R is shown in Ref. [5]. For events with R > 2.4, the W boson is balanced by a hadronic recoil that may consist of one or more jets.

By relaxing this requirement to R > 0.2 and focusing on the distribution of angular separation between the muon and the closest jet in events with at least one very high p T jet (p T > 500 GeV), it is possible to explicitly target real W emission with this measurement. Collinear W production may constitute an important background in searches for beyond the Standard Model physics that involve Lorentz-boosted top quarks [9], either in rare topologies or at high energies. If the W decay products are collinear with one of the jets, the structure of that jet can begin to resemble that of the three-pronged structure of a boosted top quark. While the rate for collinear W production is suppressed relative to dijet production with no W emission, hadronic W decays can cause a large increase in the measured jet mass. The result is that W emission from quarks at very high p T can yield single jets with definite substructure that resemble the boosted top-quark signals being searched for.",

The probability of a collinear W emission from such a jet is estimated by PYTHIA v8.210 to be 0.15%. Over half of the production of W + jets in the phase space probed in this measurement is in the collinear region. A requirement for a second high-p T jet is not applied. Although both jets initially recoil from each other and have similar p T , the jet that emits the collinear W boson can lose a significant amount of energy to the muon and neutrino, neither of which are reconstructed as part of the jet energy. Requiring a second high-p T jet would impose an implicit maximum on the energy carried by the W boson and its decay products.",

Any additional jets with p T > 100 GeV are included in the analysis. The leading jet, defined as the jet with the highest p T , is not necessarily the one closest to the muon. The R distance is always measured with respect to the closest jet. The muon is required to be isolated using both track-based and calorimeter-based isolation criteria. The track isolation requires that the scalar sum of the p T of all tracks in a cone of radius R = 0.2 around the muon be less than 10% of the muon p T . The calorimeter isolation requires that the scalar sum of the p T in all calorimeter cells in a cone of radius R = 0.2 around the muon be less than 40% of the muon p T . Applying these isolation criteria significantly reduces the background from dijet events, where muons mostly originate from heavy-flavour or inflight decays and are non-isolated. The b-tag veto also reduces the background from tt, which generates two b-quarks in their decay, by over 80%, while only 10% of the W + jets signal is rejected. Requirements on missing transverse momentum were not found to improve the signal selection or background rejection. The efficiency of the isolation requirement was studied both in simulated samples and in situ using data events containing high-p T top quarks, and the results from the two studies were in agreement. However, in the extremely collinear region, where the distance between the muon and the closest jet is R < 0.2, the limited size of the event sample did not allow the same conclusion. As a result, events where R < 0.2 are also excluded. This causes approximately 2% of the W + jets signal to be rejected.",

It uses events that pass the muon trigger without an isolation requirement and requires the muon to have p T > 38 GeV, as events with a non-isolated muon of lower p T are mostly rejected by the trigger, together with a distance R > 0.2 between the muon and the closest jet.

To ensure the scale factor is not affected by contamination from other backgrounds and the W + jets signal, it is necessary to subtract the MC prediction for the con-tamination from the control region data. As there is a circular dependency in using scaled MC predictions to derive new scalings, an iterative approach is applied. First, the scale factors are derived with the contamination subtracted using the uncorrected normalisations. Then the normalisations are updated with the scale factor corrections and the procedure to derive them is repeated. Since the contamination in each of the regions is quite small, the scale factors converge very rapidly. The dijet sample is scaled by 1.134 \u00b1 0.054, the tt sample is scaled by 0.861 \u00b1 0.061, the Z + jets sample is scaled by 0.705 \u00b1 0.052 and the W + jets sample is scaled by 0.711 \u00b1 0.016. These uncertainties in the scale factors are due to the statistical uncertainty of the data and MC samples and are part of the overall uncertainties in the measurement detailed in Section 6. However, the uncertainty in the W + jets scale factor has no effect on the results of the measurement. After the scale factors are applied, the MC predictions and observed distributions of the distance between the muon and the closest jet for each control region are shown in Fig. 1. The systematic uncertainties shown in Fig. 1 correspond to those described in Section 6.",

This technique is implemented within the RooUnfold framework [44]. A response matrix derived from MC simulation is used to correct the distribution from detector-level to particle-level. The particle-level prediction from MC simulation is used as an initial prior during the first iteration of the unfolding. Subsequent iterations use the previous iteration's unfolded distribution as a new prior.

It uses a new technique based on N-jettiness [59] to split the phase space for the real emission corrections. It relies on the theoretical formalism provided in soft-collinear effective theory. The calculation uses the CT14 NNLO Fiducial W + jets cross-sections for the selection criteria of (1) at LO, NLO and NNLO in QCD from Ref. [5]. The uncertainties shown are the scale uncertainties.  T is the transverse momentum of each jet, is used for both the renormalisation and factorisation scale.

For each of these two categories, the data distribution is unfolded. The 50 GeV gap between the two categories reduces the migration of events from one category to the other during unfolding. The resulting normalised differential W + jets cross-section is shown in Fig. 4. As the leading-jet p T increases, the fraction of events in the lower R (collinear) region increases and the fraction in the higher R (back-to-back W + jets) region decreases. This may be interpreted as an increase in the collinear W emission probability as the jets become more energetic. With higher p T the collinear peak is shifted to smaller R. This is also understood since the mass of the W boson becomes proportionally smaller compared to the energy of the jet. The full measurement results are shown in Fig. 5. The comparison to theory predictions shows results similar to the ones obtained for p leading jet T > 500 GeV in Section 7.1.",
