These quantities are measured in pp collisions at center of mass energies \u221a s = 5.02 and 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. Both charmonium states are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel, using the muon spectrometer. A comprehensive comparison to inclusive charmonium cross sections measured at \u221a s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV is performed. A comparison to non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics and fixed-order next-to-leading logarithm calculations, which describe prompt and non-prompt charmonium production respectively, is also presented. A good description of the data is obtained over the full p t range, provided that both contributions are summed. In particular, it is found that for p t > 15 GeV/c the non-prompt contribution reaches up to 50% of the total charmonium yield.",

At LHC energies, their hadronic production results mostly from the hard scattering of two gluons into a cc pair followed by the evolution of this pair into a charmonium state. Charmonium measurements in pp collisions are essential to the investigation of their production mechanisms. They also provide a baseline for protonnucleus and nucleus-nucleus results which in turn are used to quantify the properties of the quark-gluon plasma [1,2].",

            "text": "Mainly three theoretical approaches are used to describe the hadronic production of charmonium: the Color Evaporation Model (CEM) [3,4], the Color Singlet Model (CSM) [5] and the Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromo-Dynamics model e-mail: alice-publications@cern.ch (NRQCD) [6]. These approaches differ mainly in the treatment of the evolution of the heavy-quark pair into a bound state. In the CEM, the production cross section of a given charmonium is proportional to the cc cross section, integrated between the mass of the charmonium and twice the mass of the lightest D meson, with the proportionality factor being independent of the charmonium transverse momentum p t , rapidity y and of the collision center of mass energy \u221a s . In the CSM, perturbative QCD is used to describe the cc production with the same quantum numbers as the final-state meson. In particular, only color-singlet (CS) cc pairs are considered. Finally, in the NRQCD framework charmonium can be formed from a cc pair produced either in a CS or in a color-octet (CO) state. The color neutralization of the CO state is treated as a non-perturbative process. For a given order in \u03b1 s , it is expanded in powers of the relative velocity between the two charm quarks and parametrized using universal Long Distance Matrix Elements (LDME) which are fitted to the data. The predictive power of NRQCD calculations is tested by fitting the LDME to a subset of the data and comparing cross sections calculated with these LDME to measurements performed at different energies. It is therefore crucial to confront these models to as many measurements as possible, over a wide range of p t , y and \u221a s , and with as many different charmonium states as possible. The comparison can also be extended to observables other than cross sections, such as charmonium polarization [7][8][9].",

The inclusive differential cross sections are obtained as a function of p t and y over the ranges 0 < p t < 30 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, 0 < p t < 12 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV and 0 < p t < 16 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S) at \u221a s = 13 TeV. At \u221a s = 5.02 TeV only the p t -integrated \u03c8(2S) cross section is measured due to the limited integrated luminosity. The J/\u03c8 result at \u221a s = 13 TeV extends significantly the p t reach of measurements performed in a similar rapidity range by LHCb [11]. The J/\u03c8 result at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV and the \u03c8(2S) results at both \u221a s are the first at this rapidity. The inclusive \u03c8(2S)-to-J/\u03c8 cross section ratios as a function of both p t and y are also presented. These results are compared to similar measurements performed at \u221a s = 2.76 [12], 7 [13] and 8 TeV [14]. These comparisons allow studying the variations of quantities such as the mean transverse momentum p t , mean transverse momentum square p 2 t and the p t -integrated cross section as a function of \u221a s . Put together, these measurements constitute a stringent test for models of charmonium production. In particular, an extensive comparison of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross sections at all available collision energies to the calculations from two NRQCD groups is presented towards the end of the paper (Sect. 4). In addition, the p t -integrated J/\u03c8 cross section as a function of \u221a s is also compared to a CEM calculation. No comparison to the CSM is performed since complete calculations are not available at these energies beside the ones published in [13,15].",

The muon spectrometer [18] allows the detection and characterization of muons in the pseudorapidity range \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5. 1 It consists of a ten-interaction-lengths front absorber followed by a 3 T m dipole magnet coupled to a system of tracking (MCH) and triggering (MTR) devices. The front absorber is placed between 0.9 and 5 m from the Interaction Point (IP) and filters out hadrons and low-momentum muons emitted at forward rapidity. Tracking in the MCH is performed using five stations, each one consisting of two planes of cathode pad chambers positioned between 5.2 and 14.4 m from the IP. The MTR is positioned downstream of a 1.2 m thick iron wall which absorbs the remaining hadrons that escape the front absorber as well as low-momentum muons. It is composed of two stations equipped with two planes of resistive plate chambers each placed at 16.1 and 17.1 m from the IP. A conical absorber (\u03b8 < 2 \u2022 ) protects the muon spectrometer against secondary particles produced mainly by large-\u03b7 primary particles interacting with the beam pipe throughout its full length. Finally, a rear absorber located downstream of the spectrometer protects the MTR from the background generated by beam-gas interactions.",

At \u221a s = 5.02 TeV, both contributions are evaluated by varying the input p t and y distributions within limits that correspond to these effects and re-calculating the A\u03b5 corrections in each case as done in [13]. This corresponds to a variation of the input yields of at most 15% as a function of y and 50% as a function of p t . For J/\u03c8 measurements at \u221a s = 13 TeV a slightly different approach is adopted in order to further reduce the sensitivity of the simulations to the input p t and y distributions. It consists in evaluating the acceptance and efficiency corrections in small 2-dimensional bins of y and p t . These corrections are then applied on a dimuon pairby-pair basis when forming the invariant mass distribution rather than applying them on the total number of measured charmonia in a given (larger) p t and y interval.

The uncertainty on these quantities is evaluated by multiplying the covariance matrix of the fit on each side by the relevant Jacobian matrix, evaluated numerically and taking the square root of the result. This is performed either considering separately the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties, or by using their quadratic sum in order to obtain the corresponding statistical, systematic or total uncertainty. A similar approach was adopted in [12]. and NA3 [33]. A steady increase of p t and p 2 t is observed with increasing \u221a s . This is consistent with the expected hardening of the corresponding p t distributions. Moreover, values at mid-are systematically larger than at forwardrapidity. As discussed in [32], this observation could be attributed to an increase in the longitudinal momentum at forward-rapidity leaving less energy available in the transverse plane. The bottom panels of Fig. 5 show the corresponding measurements for \u03c8(2S) at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV. An increase with \u221a s is also observed similar to that of the J/\u03c8. Part of the increase observed for ALICE measurements shown in all four panels of Fig. 5 is due to the fact that the p t range used for evaluating p t and p 2 t , chosen to be the same as in the corresponding data, also increases with \u221a s . To illustrate this effect, these quantities were re-calculated either when truncating the data to the smallest available p t range (0 < p t < 8 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 12 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)) or when using the fit based on Eq. 2 to extrapolate the data to the largest available range (0 < p t < 30 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 16 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)). The resulting values are shown in the figures as dashed lines for the truncation and solid lines for the extrapolation. In all cases the observed increasing trend still holds.  t when extrapolating the p t coverage to the largest available range in ALICE data (0 < p t < 30 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 16 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)), while the dashed lines correspond to truncating the data to the smallest p t range available (0 < p t < 8 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 12 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)) Vertical lines correspond to the quadratic sum of the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. J/\u03c8 cross sections are compared to a CEM calculation from [34] in the CEM framework [34]. While the data and the model are compatible within uncertainties, the data lie on the upper side of the calculation and the difference to the central value becomes larger with increasing \u221a s .",

For higher p t on the other hand, the NLO NRQCD calculation underestimates the measured cross sections and the disagreement increases with increasing p t . This disagreement is explained by the corresponding increase of the non-prompt J/\u03c8 contribution, which according to FONLL, becomes as high as the prompt contribution and even exceeds it for p t > 15 GeV/c.

In both cases, the uncertainties on FONLL and NRQCD are considered as uncorrelated when calculating the uncertainty band on the sum. This is motivated by the fact that the NRQCD calculations refer to the production of charm quarks and charmed mesons, while the FONLL calculation applies to the production of beauty quarks and b-hadrons which are then decayed into J/\u03c8 mesons.

The FONLL+NRQCD summation is not performed for \u03c8(2S)-to-J/\u03c8 cross section ratios due to the added complexity introduced by the estimation of the error cancellation between the models. Moreover, the impact of the nonprompt charmonium contribution on these ratios is expected to be small because it enters both the numerator and the denominator with a similar magnitude (according to FONLL) and largely cancels out. We note that similar highp t NLO NRQCD calculations [38] were already compared to ALICE J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross sections at \u221a s = 7 TeV in [13], albeit with a different strategy to account for the non-prompt charmonia.    Since the NRQCD+CGC calculation from [36] extends down to zero p t , it can be integrated over p t and directly compared to ALICE p t -integrated cross sections as a function of y. This calculation neglects the contribution from charmonium with p t > 8 GeV/c to the total cross section, which anyway contributes by less than 3%. The results of this comparison as a function of y are shown in Fig. 9.  Overall, a good agreement between the model and the data is observed for all measured cross sections, for both J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) as a function of either p t or y and for all the collision energies considered. For \u03c8(2S)-to-J/\u03c8 cross section ratios as a function of p t however, the model tends to be slightly above the data especially at \u221a s = 13 TeV. This tension appears mainly because of the error cancellation between the uncertainties on the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross sections mentioned above.",

The first calculation uses three matrix elements whereas the second uses only two linear combinations of these three elements. Other differences include: the data sets used to fit these matrix elements, the minimum p t above which the calculation is applicable and the way by which contributions from \u03c7 c and \u03c8(2S) decays to prompt J/\u03c8 production are accounted for.  Although the agreement between the model and the data is of similar quality in Fig. 8 and 10, some differences are visible. In particular, in Fig. 10, the calculation tends to over-estimate the measured J/\u03c8 cross sections towards highp t and the uncertainties are larger than in Fig. 8. The uncertainties on the \u03c8(2S)-to-J/\u03c8 cross section ratios are also significantly larger and consequently the agreement to the data is better. These observations are a consequence of the differences between the two calculations detailed above and in particular the fact that the fits of the LDME start at a lower p t and include a larger number of data sets in the second case.",

When comparing the J/\u03c8 cross sections vs p t to measurements at lower \u221a s , a hardening of the spectra is observed with increasing collision energy. This is confirmed by measurements of the J/\u03c8 p t and p 2 t , while a similar trend is observed for the \u03c8(2S). Regarding inclusive \u03c8(2S)-to-J/\u03c8 cross section ratios, no \u221a s dependence is observed within uncertainties. Comparisons of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross sections and cross section ratios as a function of both p t and y to NLO NRQCD and LO NRQCD+CGC prompt-charmonium calculations have been presented for all available collision energies. Concerning the J/\u03c8 cross section as a function of p t , an excellent agreement is observed between data and theory, provided that the non-prompt contribution to the inclusive cross section is included using FONLL. This comparison indicates that for p t > 15 GeV/c, the non-prompt contribution can reach up to 50%. An overall good agreement is also observed for \u03c8(2S) production and for the cross sections as a function of y albeit with larger uncertainties.",

This is as long as one is not capable of separating experimentally the prompt and the non-prompt contributions and relies on models instead.

In this figure as well as inFig. 6, the vertical lines correspond to the quadratic sum of the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties.ForJ/\u03c8 at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV the value from [12] is used. At \u221a s = 7 TeV the data from [13] are used instead of the result from [12] because the available integrated luminosity is much larger (\u00d790) and the p t reach increased from 8 to 20 GeV/c. It was checked that both results are consistent when truncated to the same p t range. At \u221a s = 8 TeV the data from [14] are used, while for \u221a s = 5.02 and 13 TeV the results are from this analysis. In the top panels of Fig. 5, ALICE measurements are compared to lower energy results from CDF [31], PHENIX [32] and NA3[33]. A steady increase of p t and p2 t is observed with increasing \u221a s . This is consistent with the expected hardening of the corresponding p t distributions. Moreover, values at mid-are systematically larger than at forwardrapidity. As discussed in [32], this observation could be attributed to an increase in the longitudinal momentum at forward-rapidity leaving less energy available in the transverse plane. The bottom panels ofFig. 5show the corresponding measurements for \u03c8(2S) at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV. An increase with \u221a s is also observed similar to that of the J/\u03c8. Part of the increase observed for ALICE measurements shown in all four panels ofFig. 5is due to the fact that the p t range used for evaluating p t and p2 t , chosen to be the same as in the corresponding data, also increases with \u221a s . To illustrate this effect, these quantities were re-calculated either when truncating the data to the smallest available p t range (0 < p t < 8 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 12 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)) or when using the fit based on Eq. 2 to extrapolate the data to the largest available range (0 < p t < 30 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and 0 < p t < 16 GeV/c for \u03c8(2S)). The resulting values are shown in the figures as dashed lines for the truncation and solid lines for the extrapolation. In all cases the observed increasing trend still holds.",

We note that the integrated luminosity used for each measurement increases almost systematically with increasing \u221a s , starting from 19.9 nb \u22121 at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV up to 3.2 pb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. This, combined with the fact that the charmonium cross-section also increases with \u221a s, has allowed to reach increasingly higher values of p t for both J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) measurements. For the J/\u03c8 this corresponds to an increase of the p t reach from 8 GeV/c at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV up to 30 GeV/c at \u221a s = 13 TeV. For the \u03c8(2S) the corresponding increase goes from 12 GeV/c at \u221a",
