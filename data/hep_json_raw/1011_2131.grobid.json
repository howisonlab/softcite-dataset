We compare our measurement with two neutrino interaction simulations: NEUT and NUANCE. The charged current interaction rates (product of flux and cross section) are extracted by fitting the muon kinematics, with a precision of 6-15% for the energy dependent and 3% for the energy integrated analyses. We also extract CC inclusive interaction cross sections from the observed rates, with a precision of 10-30% for the energy dependent and 8% for the energy integrated analyses. This is the first measurement of the CC inclusive cross section on carbon around 1 GeV. These results can be used to convert previous SciBooNE cross section ratio measurements to absolute cross section values.",

However, in the \u223c1 GeV region, all inclusive CC measurements have been made on deuterium targets using bubble chambers [3,4]. In this energy region, the nuclear effects of the neutrino target material (from Fermi motion and the nuclear potential) are significant. Therefore, the cross section on deuterium targets is not directly applicable to the heavier nuclear target materials used in the recent acceleratorbased neutrino experiments in this energy region, e.g. SciBooNE, MiniBooNE [5] and T2K [6]. Furthermore, the results in Ref. [4] use CC quasi elastic (QE) interactions to normalize the absolute neutrino flux, which introduces additional ambiguity from the choice of CC-QE interaction model parameters.",

            "text": "In addition to this general purpose, this analysis is also motivated by two direct applications to our measurements. The first is to provide a constraint on the product of flux and cross-section for the forthcoming SciBooNE and MiniBooNE joint \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance analysis [13]. The MiniBooNE collaboration recently performed a search for \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance using only MiniBooNE data, in which the largest uncertainty stems from the flux and cross section uncertainties [14]. As shown in Fig. 1, the SciBooNE detector is located 440 m upstream of the MiniBooNE detector, sharing the same neutrino beam. In addition, the neutrino target materials are both essentially carbon; polystyrene (C 8 H 8 ) for SciBooNE, and mineral oil (CH 2 ) for MiniBooNE. Therefore, most of the flux and cross section uncertainties cancel when we compare the data from the two experiments. Then, a \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance search with higher sensitivity becomes possible [13]. The second motivation is to provide an absolute normalization factor for SciBooNE's previous cross section ratio measurements. The SciBooNE collaboration recently measured relative cross sections of charged current coherent pion production [15] and neutral current neutral pion production [16,17], which were both normalized to CC inclusive interactions. This paper provides an absolute CC interaction cross section with the same definition used in the previous analyses, so that the measured ratios can be converted to absolute cross sections.",

Transverse and directional alignment of the beam, beam width and angular divergence, beam intensity and losses along the BNB, are measured and used in the data quality selection [15]. Protons strike a 71.1 cm long beryllium target, producing a secondary beam of hadrons, mainly pions with a small fraction of kaons. A cylindrical horn electromagnet made of aluminum surrounds the beryllium target to sign-select and focus the secondary beam. For the data set used in this measurement, the horn polarity was set to neutrino mode, focusing particles with positive electric charge.

Hadronic interactions in the beryllium target are carefully modeled. For \u03c0 + production, a parametrization based on HARP [19] and BNL E910 [20] data are used. The total, inelastic and quasielastic hadronic cross sections of protons, neutrons, \u03c0 + s and \u03c0 \u2212 s with Be or Al are treated via custom cross section models [21]. Other hadronic and all electromagnetic processes of importance to neutrino production are described by standard GEANT4 models. For a detailed description of the BNB simulation code, see Ref. [21]. A total neutrino flux per proton on target of 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 cm \u22122 is expected at the SciBooNE detector location for the neutrino running mode. The flux is dominated by muon neutrinos (93%). Figure 2 shows the \u03bd \u00b5 flux from \u03c0 + and K + decays, and their fractional uncertainties. The \u03bd \u00b5 energy spectrum peaks at \u223c 0.6 GeV, and extends up to 2-3 GeV. The mean energy of the \u03bd \u00b5 flux is expected to be 0.76 GeV. The largest error on the predicted neutrino flux results from the uncertainty of pion production in the initial p-Be process in the target. The simulation predicts that 96.7% of muon neutrinos in the BNB are produced via \u03c0 + decay. The uncertainty in \u03c0 + production is determined from spline fits to the HARP \u03c0 + double differential cross section data [21]. The HARP data used are those from a thin (5% interaction length) beryllium target run [19]. While the HARP data provide a valuable constraint on the BNB flux prediction, additional uncertainties resulting from thick target effects (secondary re-scattering of protons and pions) are included through the BNB flux simulation. The resulting \u03c0 + production uncertainty is \u2248 5% at the peak of the flux distribution and increases significantly at high and low neutrino energies.",

The errors of the Feynman scaling parameters obtained from these measurements are accounted for in the systematic  error. Other major contributions to the flux error include uncertainties on hadron interactions in the target and simulation of the the horn magnetic field, which both contribute to shape and normalization uncertainties, as well as the measurement of the number of POT, which is a pure normalization uncertainty. All flux errors are modeled through variations in the simulation and result in a total error of \u2248 7% at the peak of the flux.",

Because of the difference in parameter choices (Table I), NEUT predicts a larger QE and single pion rate than NUANCE. The difference in QE rate is largely coming from the choice of \u03ba values, and the difference in single pion rate can be largely accounted for by the difference in M 1\u03c0 A assumptions. The major source of the factor of two larger multi-pion/DIS rate in NEUT compared to NUANCE is the difference of multi pion production simulation in the range 1.3 < W < 2.0 GeV; NEUT simulate these events as DIS, while NUANCE uses a resonant production model. These differences in cross section predictions between similar models with perfectly reasonable parameter choices further highlight the inherent uncertainty in neutrino generator predictions and stress the importance of additional neutrino interaction measurements in this region. Figure 3 shows the expected number of total \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions as a function of neutrino energy.

According to the simulation, the purity of \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions in this sample is 85%. Impurities are due to \u03bd \u00b5 NC interactions (\u223c 7%), interactions occurring in the surrounding material (\u223c 5%) and \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions (\u223c 1.5%). Figure 5 shows the distributions of the reconstructed muon momentum (p \u00b5 ) and angle (\u03b8 \u00b5 ) for SciBarstopped muons. The backward-going muon identification described in Sec. IV A 4 is used for this sample. All tracks which are not identified as backward-going are accounted as forward-going tracks for both data and MC samples. The expected number of events in each interaction mode is summarized in Table III. The contamination of the cosmic-ray backgrounds is estimated, using off-beam data, to be 671.2 \u00b1 11.6 events, where the uncertainty comes from the statistics of the off-beam data sample. This rather large contamination (\u223c 5%) is due to cosmic-rays penetrate SciBar vertically, which leave sparse hits and are often mis-reconstructed as short tracks. This effect is negligible for the other sub-samples. b. MRD-stopped sample The MRD-stopped sample has the largest statistics among the three. The mean energy of neutrinos in the MRD-stopped sample is 1.2 GeV. According to the simulation, the purity of \u03bd \u00b5 CC interaction in this sample is 91%. Impurities are from neutrino interactions in the EC/MRD which back-scatter (\u223c 4%), \u03bd \u00b5 NC interactions (\u223c 3%) and \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions (\u223c 2%). Figure 6 shows the distributions of the reconstructed muon momentum (p \u00b5 ) and angle (\u03b8 \u00b5 ) for MRD-stopped muons. The expected number of events in each interaction mode is summarized in Table IV. The contamination of the cosmic-ray backgrounds is es-  c. MRD-penetrated sample The MRD-penetrated sample is the highest energy sample among the three. The mean energy of neutrinos is 2.4 GeV. Although the track angles can be measured, we do not have the capability to reconstruct the muon momentum for the tracks which exit the MRD. However, this sample can provide the normalization for the highest energy region. Hence, this sample is also used for the neutrino interaction rate measurement. According to the simulation, the purity of \u03bd \u00b5 CC interaction in this sample is 97%. Impurities mostly come from \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions (\u223c 2%). Figure 7 shows the distributions of the reconstructed muon angle (\u03b8 \u00b5 ) of the MRD-penetrated muons. The expected number of events in each interaction mode is summarized in Table V. The contamination of the cosmic-ray backgrounds is estimated to be 16.6 \u00b1 1.8 events.    Figure 8 shows the efficiency of CC events as a function of true neutrino energy for each sub-sample, estimated from the NEUT based MC simulation. By combining these three samples, we can obtain fairly uniform acceptance for neutrinos above 0.4 GeV.  Table VI shows the number of events obtained from data and the predictions from NEUT and NUANCE based MC simulations. The contamination of cosmicray backgrounds is estimated using the off-beam data, and have been subtracted from the data. For the total number of events from the three sub-samples, we find a data/MC normalization factor of 1.08 for the NEUT prediction, and 1.23 for the NUANCE prediction.",

The p \u00b5 -\u03b8 \u00b5 distributions of the MRD-stopped sample clearly depends on E \u03bd , up to 1.75 GeV.

The \u03c7 2 /DOF , where DOF is the number of degree of freedom for NEUT and NUANCE predictions are respectively 225.1/159 and 560.7/159 before fitting, and they are 161.2/153 and 173.6/153 after fitting. We obtain reasonable \u03c7 2 values after the fit. We also tried to tune Q 2 distributions by fitting cross section parameters such as M A and \u03ba, however, these give similar \u03c7 2 values. So we decided to make fits with simple factors for true E \u03bd regions, as described above, because they are less model dependent. Figure 14 shows the distributions of p \u00b5 , \u03b8 \u00b5 E rec \u03bd and Q 2 rec of the MRD-stopped sample, after applying the rate normalization factors obtained in this analysis. We estimate the constrained systematic error for each distribution in the same way as described in the Sec. V B. We also propagate the errors of the scale factors (f i ) to the dis-  tributions. The errors on f i obtained from the fit include the shape error from all the flux and the cross section uncertainties, and the absolute error from all the intranuclear interaction and detector response uncertainties, as they are included into the error matrix (V sys ). The errors shown in these plots are the quadrature sum of those constrained systematic errors and errors of the f i . We find that both NEUT and NUANCE predictions well reproduce the data distributions within the errors of this analysis.

The difference of the rate normalization factors is mostly caused by the cross section difference itself (source (a)).",
