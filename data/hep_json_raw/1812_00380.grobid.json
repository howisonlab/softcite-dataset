            "text": "The standard model (SM) is known to give an incomplete description of particle physics and a number of extensions of the SM predict the existence of new light bosons [1][2][3]. In this Letter, we present a model independent search for the pair production of a light boson that decays into a pair of muons. A simple example of pair production in proton-proton (pp) collisions is pp \u2192 h \u2192 2a + X \u2192 4\u03bc + X, where h is a Higgs boson (either SM or non-SM), a is the new light neutral boson, and X are spectator particles that are predicted in several models [4]. While production via the h boson is possible, it is not required in the search presented here: the only requirement is that a pair of identical light bosons are created at a common vertex and each light boson subsequently decays to a pair of muons. These muon pairs are referred to as \"dimuons\"; the dimuon and new light boson production vertices are allowed to be displaced. The generic nature of this signature means that any limit set on the product of the cross section, branching fraction to dimuons squared, and acceptance is E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. model independent; it can thus be reinterpreted in the context of specific models.",

Two different classes of benchmark models are used to design the analysis and to verify that the results are actually model independent: the next-tominimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) [1,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] and supersymmetry (SUSY) models with hidden sectors (dark SUSY) [3,13,14]. In the NMSSM benchmark models, two of the three charge parity (CP) even neutral Higgs bosons h 1 or h 2 can decay to one of the two CP odd neutral Higgs bosons via h 1,2 \u2192 2a 1 . The light boson a 1 subsequently decays to a pair of oppositely charged muons; this is equivalent to B(a 1 \u2192 2\u03bc). In the dark SUSY benchmark models, the breaking of a new U (1) D symmetry (where the subscript \"D\" means \"Dark\") gives rise to a massive dark photon \u03b3 D .",

The non-SM decay of the Higgs bosons is modeled using the BRIDGE 2.24 program [53]. Higgs bosons are forced to decay to a pair of SUSY neutralinos n 1 via h \u2192 2n 1 . Each SUSY neutralino in turn decays to a dark photon and a dark neutralino via n 1 \u2192 n D + \u03b3 D . The dark neutralino mass m n D is set to 1 GeV; they are considered stable and thus escape detection. We set the dark photons to decay to a pair of oppositely charged muons 100% of the time, \u03b3 D \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + . Only signal events are generated because these MC generated events are used to determine the effect of the selection criteria on the signal. The Higgs boson and n 1 masses are fixed to 125 and 10 GeV, respectively. Dark photon masses m \u03b3 D are simulated between 0.25 and 8.5 GeV. The upper value was chosen such that any observed peak will be fully below the 9 GeV limit described in Section 3. Since dark photons interact weakly with SM particles, their decay width is negligible compared to the resolution in the dimuon mass spectrum. Muon displacement is modeled with an exponential distribution with c\u03c4 \u03b3 D between 0 and 100 mm. All MC generated events are run through the full CMS simulation based on Geant4 [54] and reconstructed with the same algorithms that are used for data.",

They can mimic the signal process when each J/\u03c8 meson decays to a pair of muons. The prompt double J/\u03c8 meson decay background is estimated with a method that uses both experimental and simulated data. In a control sample of experimental data, the prompt and nonprompt double J/\u03c8 meson decay contributions are separated using the matrix method (also called the \"ABCD\" method [59]). The prompt contribution is then extrapolated into the SR. Double J/\u03c8 meson events are selected with a trigger dedicated to bottom quark physics. Each event is required to have at least four muons with p T > 3.5 GeV within |\u03b7| < 2.4. No high-p T muon is required. Events must have exactly two dimuons, with labels (\u03bc\u03bc) 1 or (\u03bc\u03bc) 2 assigned randomly. The dimuon isolation follows the same definition as in Section 3. The kinematic properties of SPS and DPS events are studied using MC simulation. These events are generated using pythia 8.212 and herwig 2.7.1 [60]. The variable with the best SPS-DPS separation power is found to be the absolute difference in rapidity between the two dimuons, | y|. To remove nonresonant muon pairs from the sample, the dimuon masses are required to be within 2.8 and 3.3 GeV. The ABCD method is then employed using the dimuon isolation values as uncorrelated variables in the plane (I (\u03bc\u03bc) 1 , I (\u03bc\u03bc) 2 ). The maximum isolation on (\u03bc\u03bc) 1 and (\u03bc\u03bc) 2 is set to 12 GeV. Here, region \"A\" is the region bounded by I (\u03bc\u03bc) 1,2 < 2 GeV. Conversely, \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" are nonisolated sideband regions used to extrapolate the nonprompt contribution into region \"A\". The nonprompt | y| distribution is determined from the sideband regions; this distribution is scaled to match the nonprompt contribution in region \"A\". This is then subtracted from the | y| distribution, leaving the prompt | y| distribution in region \"A\". To separate the prompt SPS from prompt DPS in data, a template distribution f SPS | y SPS | + (1 \u2212 f SPS )| y DPS | is fitted to the corresponding | y| distribution in data, where f SPS and 1 \u2212 f SPS are the fractions of prompt SPS and DPS events, respectively. Finally, this result is used to determine the number of events that are expected in the SR of our experimental data sample. The contribution of the prompt double J/\u03c8 meson decay events in data passing the signal selections in Section 3 is calculated to be N data (SR) = 0.33 \u00b1 0.08 (stat) \u00b1 0.05 (syst).",

The limits are presented in the plane of the parameters (\u03b5 and m \u03b3D ). Constraints from other experiments [22,23,70-84] showing their 90% CL exclusion contours are also presented. The colored contours for the CMS and ATLAS limits represent different values of B(h \u2192 2\u03b3 D + X) that range from 0.1 to 40%. searches, limits are shown for values of B(h \u2192 2\u03b3 D + X) in the range 0.1-40%. It should be noted that the 40% value is excluded by the latest results on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to invisible particles [85]. It serves merely for a comparison with limits obtained in a previous version of this search [15]. The kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5, the mass of the dark photon m \u03b3 D , and the lifetime of the dark photon \u03c4 \u03b3 D are related via an analytic function f (m \u03b3 D ) that is solely dependent on the dark photon mass [86];namely, \u03c4 \u03b3 D (\u03b5, m \u03b3 D ) = \u03b5 \u22122 f (m \u03b3 D ).The lifetime of the dark photon is allowed to vary from 0 to 100 mm and m \u03b3 D can range from 0.25 to 8.5 GeV. Because of the extensions in the ranges of these parameters, this search constrains a large and previously unexplored area in the \u03b5 and m \u03b3 D parameter space. The limits on \u03b5 presented in this Letter improve on those in Ref.[15]  by a factor of approximately 2.5.",

The distribution of events in the SR is consistent with SM expectations. A model independent 95% confidence level upper limit on the product of the production cross section times branching fraction to dimuons squared times acceptance is set over the mass range 0.25 < m a < 8.5 GeV and is found to vary between 0.15 and 0.39 fb.

For the dark SUSY interpretation, the upper bound of m \u03b3 D was increased from 2 to 8.5 GeV and the excluded \u03b5 was improved by a factor of approximately 2.5.
