The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 77.5 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS experiment during 2016 and 2017. The measurement is performed using final states containing three or four charged leptons (electrons or muons), and the Z boson is detected through its decay to an oppositely charged lepton pair. The production cross section is measured to be \u03c3(ttZ) = 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 (stat) \u00b1 0.06 (syst) pb. For the first time, differential cross sections are measured as functions of the transverse momentum of the Z boson and the angular distribution of the negatively charged lepton from the Z boson decay. The most stringent direct limits to date on the anomalous couplings of the top quark to the Z boson are presented, including constraints on the Wilson coefficients in the framework of the standard model effective field theory.",

            "text": "The large amount of proton-proton (pp) collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC allows for precision measurements of standard model (SM) processes with very small production rates. Precise measurements of the inclusive and differential cross sections of the ttZ process are of particular interest because it can receive sizable contributions from phenomena beyond the SM (BSM) [1,2]. The ttZ production is the most sensitive process for directly measuring the coupling of the top quark to the Z boson. Also, this process is an important background to several searches for BSM phenomena, as well as to measurements of certain SM processes, such as tt production in association with the Higgs boson (ttH).",

The Z boson is detected through its decay to an oppositely charged lepton pair. While the data analysis strategy remains similar to the one presented in ref. [3], this new measurement benefits largely from an improved lepton selection procedure based on multivariate analysis techniques and a more inclusive trigger selection. In addition to the inclusive cross section, the differential cross section is measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z boson, p T (Z), and cos \u03b8 * Z . The latter observable is the cosine of the angle between the direction of the Z boson in the detector reference frame and the direction of the negatively charged lepton in the rest frame of the Z boson.",

To this end, we pursue two different interpretations. A Lagrangian containing anomalous couplings [11] is used to obtain bounds on the vector and axialvector currents, as well as on the electroweak magnetic and electric dipole moments of the top quark. The interpretation is extended in the context of SM effective field theory (SMEFT) [12], and we constrain the Wilson coefficients of the relevant BSM operators of mass dimension 6. There are 59 operators, among which we select the four most relevant linear combinations, as described in ref. [13].",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel magnetic flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [14]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events, while the second level selects events by running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing on a farm of computer processors. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [15].",

Two sets of simulated events for each process are used in order to match the different data-taking conditions in 2016 and 2017. Events for the ttZ signal process and a variety of background processes, including production of WZ and triple vector boson (VVV) events, are simulated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.3.3 and v2.4.2 generators [16]. In these simulations, up to one additional jet is included in the matrix element calculation. The NLO powheg v2 [17] generator is used for simulation of the tt production process, as well as for processes involving the Higgs boson produced in vector boson fusion (VBF) or in association with vector bosons or top quarks. The NNPDF3.0 (NNPDF3.1) [18,19] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for simulating the hard process. Table 1 gives an overview of the event generators, PDF sets, and cross section calculations that are used for the signal and background processes. For all processes, the parton showering and hadronization are simulated using pythia 8.203 [20,21]. The modeling of the underlying event is done using the CUETP8M1 [22,23] and CP5 tunes [24] for simulated samples corresponding to the 2016 and 2017 data sets, respectively. The CUETP8M2 and CUETP8M2T4 tunes [25] are used for the 2016 ttH and ttVV samples, respectively. Double counting of the partons generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo and pythia is removed using the FxFx [26] matching schemes for NLO samples.",

The influence of PU is mitigated through a charged hadron subtraction technique, which removes the energy of charged hadrons not originating from the PV [47]. Jets are calibrated separately in simulation and data, accounting for energy deposits of neutral particles from PU and any nonlinear detector response [48,49]. Jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are selected for the analysis. Jets are identified as originating from the hadronization of b quarks using the DeepCSV algorithm [50].

Prompt leptons are those originating from direct W or Z boson decays, while nonprompt are those that are either misidentified jets or genuine leptons resulting from semileptonic decays of hadrons containing heavy-flavor quarks. To achieve an effective rejection of the nonprompt leptons, a multivariate analysis has been developed separately for electrons and muons similar to the one presented in ref. [51]. A boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier is used via the TMVA toolkit [52] for the multivariate analysis. In addition to the lepton p T and |\u03b7|, the training uses several discriminating variables. These comprise the kinematic properties of the jet closest to the lepton; the impact parameter in the transverse plane of the lepton track with respect to the PV; a variable that quantifies the quality of the geometric matching of the track in the silicon tracker with the signals measured in the muon chambers; variables related to the ECAL shower shape of electrons; two variants of relative isolation -one computed with a fixed (R = 0.3) and another with a variable JHEP03(2020)056 cone size depending on the lepton p T [53]. The relative isolation is defined as the scalar p T sum of the particles within a cone around the lepton direction, divided by the lepton p T . Comparing a stringent requirement on the BDT output to the non-BDT-based lepton identification used in ref. [3], an increase of up to 15% in prompt lepton selection efficiency is achieved, while the nonprompt lepton selection efficiency is reduced by about a factor 2 to 4, depending on the lepton p T . Muons (electrons) passing the BDT selection and having p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 (2.5) are selected. The efficiency for prompt leptons in the ttZ signal events in the three lepton channel is around 90% when averaged over p T range used in the analysis for both electrons and muons. In the four-lepton channel, a less stringent lepton selection is used and it results in an average efficiency of 95%. In order to avoid double counting, jets within a cone of \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the selected leptons are discarded, where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, respectively.",

Depending on p T and \u03b7, the uncertainty in jet energy scale changes by 2-5% [49]. For the signal and backgrounds modeled via simulation, the uncertainty in the measurement is determined from the observed differences in the yields with and without the shift in jet energy corrections. The same technique is used to calculate the uncertainties from the jet energy resolution, which are found to be less than 1% [49]. The b tagging efficiency in the simulation is corrected using scale factors determined from data [50,65]. These are estimated separately for correctly and incorrectly identified jets, and each results in an uncertainty of about 1-4%, depending on N b .",

Experimental uncertainties from the detector response and efficiency, such as the lepton identification, jet energy scale, and b tagging uncertainties, are applied as a function of the reconstructed observable.

The constraints C Based on the best expected sensitivity, we choose the following signal regions in the three-and four-lepton channels. In the three-lepton channel, there are 12 signal regions defined by the four p T (Z) thresholds 0, 100, 200, and 400 GeV, and three thresholds on cos \u03b8 * Z at \u22121.0, \u22120.6, and 0.6. In the four-lepton channel, the predicted event yields are lower, leading to an optimal choice of only three bins defined in terms of p T (Z) with thresholds at 0, 100, and 200 GeV. The jet multiplicity requirement is relaxed to N j \u2265 1. Next, 12 control regions in the three-lepton channel are defined by requiring N b = 0 and N j \u2265 1, but otherwise reproducing the three-lepton signal selections. The three-lepton control regions guarantee a pure selection of the main WZ background. In order to also constrain the leading ZZ background of the four-lepton channel, we add three more control regions with N b \u2265 0 and N j \u2265 1 and require that there be two pairs of opposite-sign sameflavor leptons consistent with the Z boson mass in a window of \u00b115 GeV. A summary of the signal and control regions is given in table 5.",

The result of the reweighting procedure is tested on a coarse grid in BSM parameter space, where BSM samples are produced and reconstructed. The differences between the full event reconstruction and the reweighting procedure are found to be negligible for all distributions considered in this work. The theoretical uncertainties in the predicted BSM yields are scaled accordingly. From the predicted yields and the uncertainties, we construct a binned likelihood function L(\u03b8) as a product of Poisson probabilities, where \u03b8 labels the set of nuisance parameters. The test statistic is the profile likelihood ratio q = \u22122 ln(L(\u03b8, C)/L(\u03b8 max )) where\u03b8 is the set of nuisance parameters maximizing the likelihood function at a BSM point defined by the Wilson coefficients collectively denoted by C.

Models with nonzero electroweak dipole moments predict a harder p T (Z) spectrum that is not observed in data. A systematic uncertainty from an effect of nonzero Wilson coefficients on the background prediction, in particular of the tZq process amounting to a total of less than 8.5% in the most sensitive bins, was checked to have a negligible impact. The SM prediction is within the 68% confidence interval of the best-fit value of the c tZ and c [I] tZ coefficients. Figure 8 shows the complementary scan in the 2D plane spanned by the anomalous current interactions C 1,V and C 1,A , as well as the anomalous dipole interactions C 2,V and C 2,A .
