            "text": "A search for particles with the same mass and couplings as those of the standard model Higgs boson but different spin and parity quantum numbers is presented. We test two specific non-standard Higgs boson hypotheses: a pseudoscalar Higgs boson with spin-parity J P = 0 \u2212 and a graviton-like Higgs boson with J P = 2 + , assuming for both a mass of 125 GeV/c 2 . We search for these exotic states produced in association with a vector boson and decaying into a bottom-antibottom quark pair. The vector boson is reconstructed through its decay into an electron or muon pair, or an electron or muon and a neutrino, or it is inferred from an imbalance in total transverse momentum. We use expected kinematic differences between events containing exotic Higgs bosons and those containing standard model Higgs bosons. The data were collected by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, operating at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9.45 fb \u22121 . We exclude deviations from the predictions of the standard model with a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV/c 2 at the level of 5 standard deviations, assuming signal strengths for exotic boson production equal to the prediction for the standard model Higgs boson, and set upper limits of approximately 30% relative to the standard model rate on the possible rate of production of each exotic state. The observation of a narrow bosonic resonance H with mass near 125 GeV/c 2 by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] Collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 + \u2212 + \u2212 decay modes, and the evidence of such a particle at the Tevatron, primarily in association with a vector boson and in decays to bottom-antibottom quark pairs [3,4], shifted the focus of the Higgs boson experimental program to the determination of the properties of the newly discovered particle. The central question that needs to be addressed experimentally is whether only one Higgs boson is sufficient to explain the observed data. Specifically, the spin and parity of the Higgs boson should be established in order to determine if it plays the role predicted for it by the standard model (SM) of particle physics or if it represents the first hint of more exotic interactions.",

Testing the spin and parity of the Higgs boson in H \u2192 bb decays provides independent information on the properties of this particle. The models tested are described in Ref. [14]. For the SM case, Higgs boson associated production is an S-wave process (i.e. the VH system is in a state with relative orbital angular momentum L = 0, where V = W or Z), with a cross section that rises proportionally to the boson speed \u03b2 close to threshold. Here \u03b2 = 2p/ \u221a s, where p is the momentum of the Higgs boson in the VH reference frame and \u221a s is the total energy of the VH system in its rest frame [14]. In the 0 \u2212 case, the production is a P -wave process and the cross section rises proportionally to \u03b2 3 . There are several possible J P = 2 + models, but for graviton-like models [13], the production is in a D-wave process, with a cross section that rises proportional to \u03b2 5 . This dependence of the cross section on the spin-parity quantum numbers provides good kinematic leverage for discriminating exotic from SM Higgs boson production, since the exotic production rate is enhanced faster than the SM one at larger \u03b2, corresponding to a larger invariant mass of the final state system and higher momenta of the decay products. The models studied predict neither the production cross sections for pp \u2192 W H, ZH nor the decay branching fraction B(H \u2192 bb). Instead, the authors suggest [13] to purify a sample of Higgs boson candidate events and to study the invariant masses of the W bb and Zbb systems, which differ strongly among the 0 + , 0 \u2212 , and 2 + models.",

However, this is not the case for the Tevatron, where the SM Higgs boson searches typically have a s/b of 1:50 [15]. With the use of multivariate analyses (MVAs), small subsets of the data sample can be purified to achieve a s/b ratio of \u2248 1:1. Since the events in these subsets are selected with MVA discriminants that are functions of the kinematic properties of signal and background, their distributions are highly sculpted to resemble those predicted by the SM Higgs boson, and thus are not optimal in testing alternative models.",

ZH \u2192 + \u2212 bb events may be reconstructed as W H \u2192 \u03bdbb events, if one lepton fails to meet the identification criteria, or as E T bb events, if both leptons fail to meet the criteria. The generalization involves searches for pseudoscalar (J P = 0 \u2212 ) and graviton-like (J P = 2 + ) bosons (denoted X here), using MVA techniques similar to those developed for the SM searches. Admixtures of SM and exotic Higgs particles with indistinguishable mass are also considered, where exotic and SM production do not interfere due to different spin-parity quantum numbers. We set limits on the production rate times the decay branching ratio B(X \u2192 bb) of the exotic boson assuming a production cross section and decay branching ratio of the exotic boson as predicted by the SM for the Higgs boson. We also test the hypotheses of the exotic models by comparing the data with the predictions.",

Silicon-strip tracking detectors [22] surround the interaction region and provide precise measurements of charged-particle trajectories in the range |\u03b7| < 2 [23]. A cylindrical drift chamber provides full coverage over the range |\u03b7| < 1. The tracking detectors are located within a 1.4 T superconducting solenoidal magnet with field oriented along the beam direction. The energies of individual particles and particle jets are measured in segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters arranged in a projective-tower geometry surrounding the solenoid. Tracking drift chambers and scintillation counters are located outside of the calorimeters to help identify muon candidates [24]. The Tevatron collider luminosity is measured with multicell gas Cherenkov detectors [25]. The data set used in the analyses reported in this Letter corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.45 fb \u22121 . The data are collected using a three-level online event selection system (trigger). The first level, relying on special-purpose hardware [26], and the second level, using a mixture of dedicated hardware and fast software algorithms, reduce the event accept-rate to a level readable by the data acquisition system. The accepted events are processed online at the third trigger level with fast reconstruction algorithms, and recorded for offline analysis [27].",

The normalization of the W+jets MC sample in the W H \u2192 \u03bdbb search, and the normalization of the instrumental and QCD multijet samples in all searches, are constrained from data samples selected by inverting a subset of the signal selection criteria, where the expected s/b ratio is several orders of magnitude smaller than in the search samples. The quality of background modeling is shown in final-state invariant mass distribution plots included in the Supplemental Material to this Letter, which show good agreement with the data in all cases.",

HOBIT is a multivariate classifier that uses kinematic properties of reconstructed trajectories of charged particles (tracks) associated with displaced vertices, the impact parameters of the tracks, and other characteristics of reconstructed groups of collimated particles (jets) that help separate b-jets from lightflavored jets. The HOBIT classifier does not perform well for jets with E T > 200 GeV and the data-based calibration procedures associated with it suffer from greater uncertainties in this kinematic region. We therefore do not tag jets with E T > 200 GeV. The same tight (T) and loose (L) tag requirements are used as in the SM Higgs analyses.",

Distributions of the discriminant functions for all search channels are shown for the data and simulation in the Supplemental Material to this Letter.

To summarize the data in the large number of contributing channels, we follow Ref. [4]. We sum the contents of bins with similar s/b ratios over the output histograms of all channels. Fig. 1 shows the comparison of the data with the best-fit background predictions and the summed signals, separately for the SM Higgs and exotic boson signals. The signal strength modifier is denoted by \u00b5 exotic , which multiplies the SM signal strength to predict the rate in the exotic model under test.

All correlations within and between channels are taken into account in deriving the following combined limits, cross sections, and p-values. Uncertainties of 5% [31,47] on the inclusive WH and ZH production rates are estimated by varying the factorization and renormalization scales. We assign uncertainties of 4% to the Higgs boson branching ratios as calculated in Ref. [40]. Since the exotic signals are normalized to the SM Higgs cross section, the same relative uncertainties are assumed for the exotic production. The largest sources of uncertainty on the dominant backgrounds are the rates of V+heavy-flavor jets. The resulting uncertainties are up to 8% of the predicted values. Because the various analyses use different methods to obtain the V +heavy-flavor predictions, we treat their uncertainties as uncorrelated between the \u03bdbb, the E T bb, and + \u2212 bb channels. We use simulated events to study the impact of the jet-energy-scale uncertainty [48] on the rates and shapes of the signal and background expectations. We treat the jet-energy-scale variations uncorrelated among the three analyses in the combined search [49]. Uncertainties on lepton identification and trigger efficiencies range from 2% to 6% and are applied to both signal and MC-based background pre-dictions. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is 6%, of which 4.4% originates from detector acceptance uncertainties and 4.0% is due to the uncertainty on the inelastic pp cross section [50]. The luminosity uncertainty is correlated between the signal and MC-based background predictions.",

[51] on the production rates times the branching fraction B(X \u2192 bb) for 0 \u2212 and 2 + Higgs bosons are reported in Table II, both separately for each channel and combined, in units of the SM Higgs boson production rate. The limits are computed from a likelihood defined as the product of the probability densities for the bin contents of the MVA histograms over all bins of each histogram and all channel histograms, assuming Poisson probability densities for the bin contents, uniform prior densities for the SM and exotic signal strength modifiers \u00b5 exotic and \u00b5 SM , and Gaussian prior densities for the nuisance parameters describing systematic uncertainties. Posterior densities and upper limits on the SM and exotic Higgs boson rates are obtained from pseudoexperiments (PEs), where in each PE the likelihood is integrated over the nuisance parameters and then it is maximized. The medians of the distributions of results from PEs are used as the most probable values. The SM ratio between WH and ZH production rates is assumed when combining WX and ZX searches. Limits are listed either assuming that the SM Higgs boson is present as a background, or absent. Since the exotic 0 \u2212 and 2 + signals populate kinematic regions different from those of the SM Higgs boson, and since the SM Higgs boson production rate is small, the expected and observed limits on the exotic rates are very similar whether the SM Higgs boson is present or not. The observed combined limits are somewhat stronger than expected, with an exclusion rate of \u00b5 exotic < 0.32 in the 0 \u2212 case (approximately a one standard deviation deficit), and \u00b5 exotic < 0.35 in the 2 + case (approximately a two standard deviation deficit). The E T bb channel carries the largest weight in the combination. A number of candidates somewhat lower than expected appear in the most signal-like bins of the exotic discriminants in this channel. The two-dimensional cross section fits, which allow for arbitrary rates of both SM and exotic Higgs bosons to be simultaneously present, are shown in Fig. 2, separately for the 0 \u2212 and 2 + searches.  We report the observed values and the expected distributions of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) [51] in the SM and the exotic hypotheses and list the combined results in Table III. The Table includes the p-values for the null and test hypotheses, defined as the conditional probabilities p null = P (LLR \u2264 LLR obs |SM) and p test = P (LLR \u2265 LLR obs |exotic), respectively, the values of CL s = p test /(1 \u2212 p null ), and the equivalent number of Gaussian standard deviations z corresponding to each p-value, defined by p = [1 \u2212 erf(z/ \u221a 2)]/2 [51]. There is a deficit in the observed number of events in the signallike bins (log 10 (s/b) > \u22121.5) of the exotic discriminant, which is visible in Fig. 1 in both the 0 \u2212 and the 2 + searches. The dominant contribution to this deficit comes from the W X + ZX \u2192 E T bb search. This deficit in the exotic search is not evidence against the SM Higgs boson, as the exotic search tests for events with different kinematic properties (high M V bb ) than those of the SM Higgs boson. Indeed, the combined cross section fit, shown in Fig. 2, is consistent with the SM Higgs boson rate with a discrepancy of less than 0.5 standard deviations.",
