            "text": "Measurements in W + W \u2212 events at LEP2 and in B hadron semileptonic decays at B factories and LHCb provide intriguing hints of a violation of lepton universality in the charged current coupling of tau leptons relative to those for electrons and muons. We propose a novel, self-calibrating method to test tau lepton universality in W boson decays at the LHC. We compare directly the ratio of the numbers of selected \u03c4 had and e\u03bc final states in di-leptonic top quark pair events with that in Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. Here = e or \u03bc and \u03c4 had is a candidate semi-hadronic tau decay. This \"doubleratio\" cancels to first order sensitivity to systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction of e, \u03bc, and \u03c4 leptons, thus improving very significantly the precision to which tau lepton universality can be tested in W boson decay branching ratios at the LHC. Using particle-level Monte Carlo events, and a parameterised simulation of detector performance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and estimate the most significant residual sources of uncertainty arising from experimental and phenomenological systematics. Our studies indicate that a single LHC experiment precision on the tau lepton universality test of around 1.4% is achievable with a data set of L dt = 140 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. This would improve significantly upon the precision of 2.5% on the four-experiment combined LEP2 measurements. If the central value of the proposed new measurement were equal to the central value of the LEP2 measurement this would yield an observation of BSM physics at a significance level of around 5\u03c3 .",

For example, in [17] a charge 2/3 scalar LQ with b\u03c4 and c\u03bd Yukawa couplings is able to accommodate the measured central values of R(D) and R(D * ) without introducing an unacceptable level of flavour changing neutral current processes involving the first two generations of quarks and leptons. Interestingly, a possible link between the LEP2 measurement of R(W ) and the B 0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 D ( * )+ excess has received little attention in the literature. We note that R(W ) might receive contributions at loop level from a LQ that couples preferentially to the \u03c4 . For example, if cs and s\u03c4 Yukawa couplings were added to the charge 2/3 LQ scenario of [17] it could produce an enhancement in B(W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd). Such loop-level contributions might naturally lead to a smaller fractional deviation from LU in R(W ) than in R(D) and R(D * ), but this would depend, obviously, on the sizes of the assumed couplings.",

In addition, non-tt backgrounds can be almost completely eliminated from the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had final state by employing b-jet tagging and the presence of the candidate. This means that the background from misidentified hadronic jets to the \u03c4 had signature in the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had final state is likely to be significantly smaller than that in the inclusive single W \u2192 \u03c4 had \u03bd final state. However, systematic uncertainties associated with the \u03c4 had candidate (identification efficiency, background and energy scale) still contribute directly to the measured rate of tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had events. For example, in a measurement by ATLAS [19] in dileptonic tt events the systematic uncertainty on the branching fraction B(t \u2192 b\u03c4 \u03bd) is around 7.5%. In a measurement by CMS of the cross section for the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had final state [20], the systematic uncertainty is around 9.5%; to which the combined contribution from the identification efficiency (6.0%), background (4.3%), and energy scale (2.5%) for \u03c4 had candidates was 7.8%. In the above-mentioned best currently published measurements from ATLAS [19] and CMS [20] based on the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had final state the systematic uncertainties associated with the \u03c4 had candidate are around a factor of three greater than total uncertainty of 2.5% on the LEP2 measurement of R(W ).",

In Sect. 2.1 we describe briefly the simple parameterised simulation of detector performance we use in the study of the proposed double-ratio analysis method. We describe also the variations in detector performance we consider in the study of experimental systematic uncertainties. Further details are given in the Appendix. In Sect. 2.2 we describe the MC generators used and the potential sources of phenomenological systematic uncertainties that we have considered in our study. In Sect. 2.3 we describe the candidate event selection criteria we employ for the four signal candidate event samples used in the double-ratio method. In the selection of Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 candidates we propose a novel selection variable, m * 3 , that improves the discrimination power against the dominant backgrounds, such as tt, diboson production, as well as events containing a leptonically decaying vector boson plus a QCD jet that is misidentified as a \u03c4 had candidate (W +jet). In Sect. 2.4 we evaluate the size and composition of the four selected candidate event samples. The expected numbers of events are given for an integrated luminosity at \u221a s = 13 TeV of L dt = 140 fb \u22121 , which corresponds approximately to that available for physics analysis in ATLAS and CMS at the end of LHC run 2 [22,23].

In Sect. 2.6 we present the effect of systematic uncertainties on the ratios R(bbW W ), R(Z ), R(W Z), and R(W ). We thus demonstrate that in the double-ratio R(W Z) there is a high degree of cancellation in the experimental systematic uncertainties that have dominated previous related analyses at hadron colliders. We evaluate the residual systematic uncertainties on R(W Z) arising from the effects discussed in Sects. 2.1 and 2.2.

Because the same criterion is applied in the selection of the numerator tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had and denominator tt \u2192 bbe\u03bc events, we expect the ratio R(bbW W ) to be largely insensitive to systematic uncertainties associated with jet reconstruction, JES, JER, and btagging. Requiring two b-tagged jets reduces the background in the selected tt \u2192 bbW + W \u2212 event samples from non-tt sources; it also reduces the background from tt events in which a b-quark jet is misidentified as a prompt e, \u03bc, or \u03c4 had . Candidate tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had events are rejected if the invariant mass of the \u03c4 had candidate and the highest p T non-btagged jet, m( j \u2212 \u03c4 had ), satisfies 50 GeV < m( j \u2212 \u03c4 had ) < 90 GeV. This criterion reduces the background from lep-ton+jet tt events in which the hadronically decaying W boson produces two reconstructed jets, one of which is misidentified as a \u03c4 had candidate. The effectiveness of this criterion is illustrated by Fig. 3, which shows in the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had candidate event sample the distribution of m( j \u2212 \u03c4 had ), having applied all other tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had event selection criteria. The upper plot shows events in which the \u03c4 had candidate originates from a genuine \u03c4 decay and the lower plot shows events in which the \u03c4 had candidate originates from a misidentified hadronic jet. A clear peak at around the mass of the W boson can be seen in the lower plot. In addition to helping reject background from misidentified hadronic jets, the distributions in Fig. 3 offer the possibility to make a data-driven estimate of the background in the \u03c4 had candidate sample. This will be useful in reducing the systematic uncertainty on the background yield. ",

Our study is based on particle-level MC events and a simple parameterised simulation of detector performance. Nevertheless, we believe our demonstration that the dominant experimental systematic uncertainties cancel in the double ratio, as well as our estimates of the major residual systematic uncertainties, to be broadly realistic. We have based our simulation of lepton, jet and / E T reconstruction on measurements of efficiencies, backgrounds and systematic uncertainties published by ATLAS and CMS [24-55], having chosen identification algorithms whose performance is suited to the needs of our analysis. The above cited performance papers are for the most part based on around a quarter of the full run 2 data set of L dt = 140 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV that is now available. It is, therefore, to be expected that the full run 2 data set will allow systematic uncertainties on lep-   ton and jet identification efficiencies to be reduced by about a factor of two compared to the values we have assumed in our study. Of particular relevance to our study, it is to be hoped that the high statistics provided by the full run 2 data set will allow the p T dependence of the identification efficiency for \u03c4 had candidates to be studied over the range 25 < p T < 100 GeV, without the need to use tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had events and implicitly assume that B(W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) takes its SM value. This could be achieved, e.g., by the selection of a dedicated Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had event sample in which there is a high transverse momentum initial state radiation. The residual non-cancellation in R(W Z) of the p T /\u03b7dependent \u03c4 had identification uncertainty, as shown in Table 4, arises primarily from the differences in the \u03c4 had p T distributions between the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had samples, as shown in Fig. 6. We have considered possible methods to reduce the impact of the different \u03c4 p T distributions. One simple approach would be to introduce an additional cut on \u03c4 had p T < 65 GeV; this removes the high p T tail in the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had sample, with negligible changes to the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had sample. This has the effect of improving the cancellation in R(W Z) of the p T -dependent \u03c4 had identification uncertainty between the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had samples; the residual systematic uncertainty reduces from 0.8%, as shown in Table 4, to 0.2%. More sophisticated potential methods to mitigate the effects of the p T -dependent \u03c4 had identification uncertainty might be (a) to reweight the tau p T distribution in the tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had sample to resemble that in the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had sample, or (b) to perform measurements of R(W Z) in bins of \u03c4 had p T and subsequently combine the measurements, taking into account the bin-to-bin correlations in the systematic uncertainties. However, any such methods might run the risk of increasing the sensitivity of R(W Z) to phenomenological uncertainties. A careful investigation of such issues will be needed in order to optimise the overall uncertainty arising from experimental and phenomenological systematic uncertainties. This will require study of the large number of fully simulated MC samples produced by the experiments, corresponding to different models of tt and Z boson production and decay, and is beyond the scope of this paper.",

For a data set of L dt = 140 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV we estimate a statistical uncertainty on R(W ) of 0.5%. Our study confirms the almost perfect cancellation in R(W ) of systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction efficiencies of e, \u03bc, and \u03c4 leptons that are applied as constant factors. We find that the most significant residual sources of uncertainty on R(W ) arise from systematic uncertainties on the p T and \u03b7 dependence of the reconstruction efficiencies of e, \u03bc, and \u03c4 leptons, which total around 1.0%. We have evaluated also potential uncertainties arising from backgrounds to the selected event samples and from various phenomenological sources.",

A recent paper by the CMS Collaboration [37] describes the methods used to identify \u03c4 had candidates at \u221a s = 13TeV and details the methods used to determine identification efficiencies, background rates and energy scale, and their associated systematic uncertainties, using a data set corresponding to L dt = 36 fb \u22121 . We choose to simulate the \u03c4 had identification efficiency and fake probabilities corresponding to the \"very-very-tight\" operating point of [37]. The efficiency is around 30% and is independent of p T . The misidentification rate for hadronic jets is around 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for p T \u2248 25 GeV decreasing to around 10 \u22124 for p T \u2248 100 GeV. The misidentification rate is approximately independent of |\u03b7| [38]. We simulate also the discriminants against electrons and muons described in [37]: the \"Tight\" discriminant against electrons has a \u03c4 had identification efficiency of 75% and a fake probability of 10 \u22123 ; the \"Tight\" discriminant against muons has a \u03c4 had identification efficiency of 99% and a fake probability of 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [39].",

A tag and probe analysis of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had events in [37] results in a relative uncertainty on the identification efficiency of \u03c4 had candidates of 5% for \u03c4 had p T up to 60 GeV. Samples of tt events are used in [37] to cross check the efficiency for \u03c4 had p T up to 100 GeV; a relative uncertainty of 7% for 60 < p T < 100 GeV is assigned. Implicitly this latter analysis assumes that B(W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) takes its SM value, because it relies on a comparison between the absolute numbers of tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had candidate events observed in the CMS data and predicted by the MC. Clearly, for our proposed test of LU using tt events it would not be legitimate to set data-MC scale factors for \u03c4 had using tt \u2192 bb \u03c4 had events in this way; this means that it will be difficult to control the p T dependence of the identification efficiency for \u03c4 had candidates beyond the range in \u03c4 had p T covered by the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had event sample. We consider a p T /\u03b7-independent relative systematic uncertainty of 5%. We generate a p T -dependent systematic uncertainty on the identification efficiency of \u03c4 had candidates by modifying the efficiency by a relative amount that varies linearly between 5% at p T = 30 GeV and 0% at p T = 130 GeV and above.

Of the four signal samples, Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had will be the sample with the largest fraction of MJ background. An important motivation for our choice to simulate the \"very-very-tight\" operating point of [37] for \u03c4 had identification, which has relatively low efficiency but high rejection power, is to minimise the uncertainties arising from MJ backgrounds. From selection with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 T eV , CMS Collaboration, JINST 10, P06005 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/10/06/P06005 31. For example, the region 1.37<|\u03b7|<1.52 is usually excluded for precision measurements involving electrons or \u03c4 had . We simulate this gap in this detector parameterisation 32. The efficiency for electron identification according for the \"Tight likelihood\" category is shown as functions of p T and \u03b7 in Figure  8 of[28] 33. We simulate approximately the efficiency for the single-electron trigger according to that given as a function of p T in Figure 26 (a) of [25], except that the value of p T on the abscissa is shifted up by 2 GeV to account for the fact that for most of the LHC run 2 the trigger threshold was set at p T = 26 GeV [27] 34.

Aaboud et al., 'Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using 2015-2016 LHC proton-proton collision data', ATLAS Collaboration, JINST 14, P03017 (2019). https:// doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/03/P03017 35. The choice of 0.002 corresponds to a value in the middle of the range of values given in  195 (2017). https:// doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-4756-2 An estimate of various sources of backgrounds to the sample of high p T , isolated electron candidates in ATLAS is given in Table 3. The \"Very tight likelihood\" criterion in this paper has a very similar efficiency to \"Tight likelihood\" criterion in [28]. We, therefore, take the background probabilities given here for \"Very tight likelihood\" as being representative of those for the \"Tight likelihood\" in [28] 37. A.M. Sirunyan et al., 'Performance of reconstruction and identification of \u03c4 leptons decaying to hadrons and \u03bd \u03c4 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13T eV , CMS Collaboration, JINST 13, P10005 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/13/10/P10005 38. The \u03c4 had identification efficiencies and jet fake probabilities corresponding to various working points of the MVA-based \u03c4 had isolation algorithm are shown as a function of p T in Figure 4   Figure 7 (left) of [36] the fraction of MJ background in the signal region of visible mass in the selected \u03c4 had sample is seen to be around 20%, when using the \"tight\" operating point of the MVA-based \u03c4 had identification algorithm and applying the \"tight\" isolation requirement to the muon. It can be seen from Figure 4 (left) of [36] that the signal efficiency for \u03c4 had decreases by a factor of around 1.5 between the \"tight\" and \"very-very-tight\" operating points and from Figure 4 (right) of [36] that the background rejection improves by a factor of three. Therefore background to signal ratio improves by roughly a factor of two between the \"tight\" \u03c4 had operating points. Similarly, in section 6.2 of [24] it is stated that the probability for a muon produced in a hadronic jet to satisfy tight isolation requirements is about 0.05 in the barrel, and goes up to about 0.15 in the endcap. This probability is around a factor of two larger than the probability of 0.03 that we have assumed for the probability for a muon produced in a hadronic jet. Taking these two factors of two into account we can, therefore, estimate the fraction of MJ background in the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 had sample selected using the \"very-very-tight\" operating point of the MVA-based \u03c4 had identification algorithm and our chosen electron/muon isolation to be around 20/(2 \u00d7 2) = 5%. The relative uncertainty on the MJ background quoted in section 9.1 of [36] is 5% and results from the limited size of the control samples in the L dt = 36fb ",

Resolution in / E T is taken into account by adding the difference between particle-level and detector level p T of each lepton and jet in the event. We have checked that this procedure reproduces approximately the / E T resolutions given in [52] and [54]. The effects of multiple proton-proton collisions or \"pileup\" are not simulated in our study. In general, the lepton and jet identification algorithms employed by ATLAS and CMS are designed to have small pile-up dependence [55]. We take the performance values we have implemented to represent averages over the pile-up conditions experienced at the LHC.  Table 5 of [56] gives a number of predictions of the W + W \u2212 fiducial cross-section, with systematic uncertainties in the range 2-5%. Given that Z boson and EW diboson production are both dominated by qq-initiated processes it is reasonable to assume that uncertainties due, e.g., to PDFs would at least partially cancel in the ratio. We assume an uncertainty of 3% on the ratio of the cross sections for Z boson and EW diboson production. In [57] the tt cross section is measured with a precision of around 3%. Since tt production is dominated by gluon-initiated processes we do not assume any cancellation of systematic uncertainties in evaluating the ratio to the Z boson cross section 62. G. Aad  ",
