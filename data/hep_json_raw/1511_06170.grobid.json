The data are compared with the expectation for the spin correlation predicted by the SM and with the expectation of no correlation. Using a template fit method, the fraction of events that show SM spin correlations is measured to be 0.72 \u00b1 0.08 (stat) +0.15    \u22120.13 (syst), representing the most precise measurement of this quantity in the muon+jets final state to date.",

Given the high centre-of-mass energy at the LHC, the helicity basis is used where the spin quantization axis is defined as the top quark or antiquark direction in the tt rest frame. The corresponding value of the spin correlation strength in the helicity basis is referred to as A hel . Since the spin correlation strength is precisely, but non-trivially, predicted by the standard model (SM) an accurate measurement of this variable tests various aspects of the SM, including the strength of the QCD coupling and the relative contribution of tt production modes, although new physics can influence the spin correlation strength [1,2].",

The CDF Collaboration extracted the fraction f of events with the SM prediction of spin correlation using the lepton+jets final state [3] and the D0 Collaboration extracted this fraction using the dilepton final states [4,5].

Events with a muon coming from a \u03c4 decay are not considered as part of the signal. In this analysis, the traditional discrete hypotheses are investigated: SM and uncorrelated tt production and decay. In the MEM, the likelihood of an observed event to be produced by a given theoretical model is calculated. The likelihood ratio of the sample allows to distinguish between the two hypotheses. In addition, the distribution of event likelihood ratios is used in a template fit to extract the fraction f of events with the SM prediction of spin correlation. The rest of this Letter is organised as follows. In Section 2, a description of the apparatus used in this measurement, the CMS detector, is given. Following, in Section 3, a description of the simulation samples used in this analysis is given. The event selection and reconstruction procedure of the physics objects in an event are given in Section 4. In Section 5, the MEM is briefly explained. Section 6 describes the first part of this analysis, the hypothesistesting procedure, followed by the extraction of the variable f with a template fit in Section 7. The sources of systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 8. A description on the treatment of these uncertainties in both parts of the analysis and the results are given in Section 9. Finally, a summary of the analysis is presented in Section 10.",

For each muon candidate, a PF-based relative isolation is calculated, corrected for pileup effects on an event-by-event basis.

The jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet, which has been determined from simulation to be within 5% to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Contributions from pileup are taken into account by an offset correction to the jet energies. Jet energy scale corrections (JES) up to particle-level are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in-situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and pho-ton+jet events. The jet energy resolution (JER) in simulation is corrected to match the resolution observed in data. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated uncharacteristic noise patterns in certain HCAL regions [32] and in the silicon avalanche photodiodes used in the ECAL barrel detector. The first three jets leading in p T are required to have a p T of at least 30 GeV, the fourth leading jet of at least 25 GeV and the remaining jets at least 20 GeV. At least two selected jets should be identified as coming from the decay of B-hadrons, based on the combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm with medium working point (CSVM) [33]. The CSV algorithm makes use of secondary vertices, when available, combined is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . To reduce the effect of Final State Radiation (FSR), while not statistically limiting the analysis, we restrict the data set to events with four or five selected jets. To ensure that the selected jets in the event describe the tt kinematic quantities, we reject events if they have additional forward jets in the region of 2.4 < |\u03b7| < 4.7 and these have p T > 50 GeV.",

The kinematic quantities observed in the event are varied within the detector resolution to satisfy some predefined constraints, i.e. the reconstructed hadronically decaying W boson mass is required to be consistent with 80.4 GeV and the reconstructed top quark and antiquark masses are required to be equal. The HitFit algorithm tries every jet-quark permutation and the solution with the highest goodness-of-fit (or equivalently, lowest \u03c7 2 /ndof with ndof being the number of degrees of freedom) is chosen as the best estimate of the correct jet-quark permutation. We do not rely on HitFit to estimate the jet-quark permutation correctly, however, HitFit is used to decide which four jets in the event to use in the reconstruction of the tt final state in five-jet events. It is required that two of the jets selected by HitFit are identified as originating from B-hadrons. The selection of the jets in the event could be done with simpler methods, e.g. selecting the highest-p T jets, but HitFit offers the possibility to apply additional quality criteria. In order to reduce the background fraction and the fraction of mismodeled events, we only select events with a HitFit \u03c7 2 /ndof < 5 or, equivalently, with the fit probability larger than 0.08. The value of the \u03c7 2 /ndof-selection is chosen to maximise the separation power defined by Eq. (7) in Section 6. Mismodeled events can be due to the inclusion of radiated jets in the tt reconstruction or events with poorly reconstructed jet quantities.

The event transfer function is the product of the object transfer functions, assuming no correlation between the reconstructed objects. The jet energy transfer function is determined from tt simulation to which the JES and JER corrections have been applied. For each jet in the simulation, unambiguously matched to a parton with R(jet, parton) < 0.3, the E jet and E parton are compared (separately for jets matched to b and light-flavour partons). The E jet distribution is fitted with a Gaussian function, where the Gaussian mean and width depend on E parton and are given by \u03bc(E jet ) = m 0 (\u03b7 parton )",

As a result, the ME does not always cover the full event information leading to a slightly reduced discrimination between both hypotheses. In addition, background events evaluated under a tt hypothesis will more closely resemble the uncorrelated hypothesis as there is no correlation between the decay products. In the template fit part of this analysis, the small bias due to this effect is corrected for with a calibration curve (described in Section 7), whereas in the hypothesis testing the background contribution is fixed to the predictions from simulation, so no bias is present. MadWeight [39], the tool used to perform the MEM likelihood calculations, can partially correct for the initial state radiation (ISR) effect by evaluating the LO ME at an overall partonic p T of the tt system equal to the reconstructed p T of the system, thus properly treating fivejet events where one jet is due to ISR. Due to final state radiation (FSR), the matching with the LO ME, which requires four jets as input, becomes more difficult and more sensitive to systematic uncertainties related to variations on the jet energy scale or on the renormalisation/factorisation scales. The tt system is reconstructed using the four selected jets based on HitFit in the event, the lepton and the p miss T . The p miss T quantity is assigned to the undetected neutrino from the tt muon+jets final state. In the MadWeight likelihood calculations, every jet-quark permutation compatible with b tagging information is taken into account.",

This reweighting is not applied in this analysis, but we do assign an uncertainty to the tt modeling by changing the event weight and propagating the effect to the \u22122 ln \u03bb event shape.",

(12) In the assumption that there are only the SM tt pairs or uncorrelated tt pairs, this results in an indirect extraction of A hel . By making use of the relation A measured hel = f SM A SM,MC hel where A SM,MC hel = 0.324 \u00b1 0.003 obtained in simulation, which is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted value of A SM hel = 0.319 [51,52] which includes NLO QCD and electroweak corrections, A measured hel = 0.23 \u00b1 0.03 (stat) +0.05 \u22120.04 (syst) is obtained. It is found that the systematic uncertainties due to JER, trigger, lepton identification and isolation efficiencies, and b tagging efficiency are not relevant compared to the statistical uncertainties associated to them.
