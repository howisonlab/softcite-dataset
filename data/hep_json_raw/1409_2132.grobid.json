The T symmetry can be probed by exchange of initial and final states in the reversible transitions between flavor and CPdefinite states of the mesons which are only connected by the T conjugation. While such a test was successfully performed by the BaBar experiment with neutral B mesons, the KLOE-2 detector can probe T -violation in the neutral kaons system by investigating the process with K S \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l \u2213 \u03bd l and K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decays. Analysis of the latter is facilitated by a novel reconstruction method for the vertex of K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay which only involves neutral particles. Details of this new vertex reconstruction technique are presented as well as prospects for conducting the direct T symmetry test at the KLOE-2 experiment.",

            "text": "Among possible experimental ways to study the T symmetry violation, it is of special interest to test the symmetry directly, i.e. by comparing amplitudes for a process and its time inverse. For spin 0 particles such as neutral mesons the inverse process is obtained simply by the exchange of initial and final states. To date, the only evidence of T violation in the neutral kaon system was found by the CPLEAR experiment through measurement of the Kabir asymmetry [1]. However, use of the CPT -even K 0 K 0 process raised some controversy due to possible influence of CP violation on the result. Quantum entanglement of neutral kaons produced at the \u03c6 factory allows to obtain and compare kaon transitions between flavour-definite and CP-definite states and their time inverses which are only connected by time reversal conjugation [2]. This allows for a direct test of the T symmetry independent of CP and CPT . A similar idea was recently used by the BaBar experiment to directly observe T violation in the neutral B meson system [3,4]. In turn, KLOE-2 is capable of performing the first direct T symmetry test with neutral kaons.",

These conditions are met by states with definite strangeness {K 0 ,K 0 } and CP-eigenstates {K + , K \u2212 }. The former are identified by semileptonic decays K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 + \u03bd l andK 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u2212\u03bd l (with assumption of the \u0394Q = \u0394S rule) whereas the latter must decay hadronically into two pions (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) for CP=+1 or 3\u03c0 0 for CP=-1. These two bases are connected by four possible transitions, listed in Table 1.

Recently the detector was upgraded to KLOE-2 [6] with addition of new calorimeters at small angles around the beam pipe [7] and a new Cylindrical-GEM inner tracker [8]. Processes required for the T test include semileptonic decays of neutral kaons with the partner kaon decaying into 2 or 3 pions. While for the 2-pion final state \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 can be chosen and well reconstructed from DC tracks, the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay requires special treatment as it only includes neutral particles and the K S \u2192 \u03c0 \u03bd decay does not provide full kinematic information on the event due to a missing neutrino. Therefore a special reconstruction method for K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2192 6\u03b3 decay was prepared which uses only information on \u03b3 hits in the EMC. The decay point and time are reconstructed using a technique similar to GPS positioning. More details can be found in Ref. [9].",
