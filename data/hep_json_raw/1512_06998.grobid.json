Numerically, if W -annihilation contributions are neglected, the branching fractions of the D \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 decays should be at about 1.0\u00d710 \u22124 level [2,3].",

Details on the features and capabilities of the BESIII detector can be found in Ref. [6]. The response of the experimental apparatus is studied with a detailed GEANT-based [7] Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the BESIII detector for particle trajectories generated by the generator KKMC [8] using EVTGEN [9], with initial state radiation (ISR) effects [10] and final state radiation effects [11] included. Simulated events are processed in a fashion similar to data. At the \u03c8(3770) resonance, DD pairs are produced in a coherent 1 \u2212\u2212 final state with no additional particles. To suppress huge non-DD backgrounds [1], we employ the \"double tag\" (DT) technique first developed by the MARK-III Collaboration [12,13] to perform absolute measurements of the branching fractions. We select \"single tag\" (ST) events in which either a D orD is fully reconstructed. We then look for the D decays of interest in the remainder of each event, namely, in DT events where both the D andD are fully reconstructed. The absolute branching fractions for D meson decays are calculated by the general formula",

Contributions to sideband D are assumed to be uniformly distributed across the other regions [18]. For these events from the sideband regions, we perform similar fits to the 3\u03c0 mass spectra, and find the peaking background yields N bkg \u03c9(\u03b7) for D + and D 0 respectively, as listed in Table II. By subtracting the \u03c9 peaking background extending underneath the signal region, the DT signal yields, N obs sig , are obtained. The statistical significances for D + \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 are found to be 5.5\u03c3 and 4.1\u03c3, respectively.  We now remove the \u03c9 helicity requirement, and investigate the helicity dependence of our signal yields. By following procedures similar to those described above, we obtain the signal yield in each |H \u03c9 | bin. The efficiency corrected yields are shown in Fig. 4, demonstrating agreement with expected cos 2 \u03b8 H behavior, further validating this analysis.",

Following a similar fit procedure, with results shown in Fig. 5, we determine \u03b7\u03c0 + and \u03b7\u03c0 0 DT yields as listed in Table II. With the DT technique, the branching fraction measurements are insensitive to systematics coming from the ST side since they mostly cancel.
