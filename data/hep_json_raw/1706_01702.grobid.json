The analysis uses 20.2 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collision data, collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Crosssections for W W/W Z production are measured in highp T fiducial regions defined close to the experimental event selection. The cross-section is measured for the case where the hadronically decaying boson is reconstructed as two resolved jets, and the case where it is reconstructed as a single jet. The transverse momentum distribution of the hadronically decaying boson is used to search for new physics. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model predictions, and 95% confidence intervals are calculated for parameters describing anomalous triple gauge-boson couplings.",

Measurements in the semileptonic channel W V \u2192 \u03bdqq (V = W, Z ) have been performed by ATLAS [14] and CMS [15] at \u221a s = 7 TeV, and by the Tevatron experiments in pp collisions [16,17]. The semileptonic channel offers features complementary to the leptonic channels. On the one hand, the presence of jets and the large background from W + jets and tt production limit the experimental precision. On the other hand, the semileptonic channel has an approximately six times higher branching fraction than the fully leptonic channels. Also, for W W , the original diboson kinematics can be better reconstructed in an \u03bdqq final state than in an \u03bd \u03bd final state, since the latter has two invisible particles, rather than only one in \u03bdqq . Both of these advantages are particularly beneficial for searching for beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) enhancements of diboson production due to heavy new parti-cles, which could modify the diboson spectrum at high transverse momentum ( p T ) of the bosons [18].",

The C W V factors account for reconstruction inefficiencies, resolution effects, and for contributions to the signal region from W V events that do not decay to \u03bdqq (such as W V \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bdqq or W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd); the latter are included in the C W V numerator and not in the denominator.

The most important of these uncertainties are those related to the jet reconstruction. Uncertainties in the small-R jet energy scale and resolution are accounted for [57,63]. In the W V \u2192 \u03bdJ channel, uncertainties in the large-R jet energy and jet mass scales are also taken into account. The scale uncertainties of the large-R jets are estimated using a double-ratio method that compares calorimeter-and trackjets in data and MC simulation [21]. The energy and mass resolution uncertainties of large-R jets are estimated by smearing the jet energies/masses so as to degrade the resolutions by 20%; this approach is based on prior studies of large-R jets [64,65]. The systematic uncertainty due to the JVF requirement is also included [66]. In addition to the jetrelated uncertainties, there are also systematic uncertainties in the electron and muon reconstruction (including triggering, object reconstruction, identification, and the energy scale and resolution) [54,[67][68][69][70]. The effects of the jet and lepton uncertainties are propagated to the E miss T calculation, and an additional systematic uncertainty in the soft terms entering the E miss T calculation is also included [60]. In the cross-section fits, the V + jets yield is taken to be a free parameter, while several uncertainties in the modelling of its shape are accounted for (in addition to the shape uncertainties from the previously mentioned detector effects). Systematic uncertainties in the V + jets shape are estimated by varying the MC event generator used (Sherpa compared to Alp-gen+Pythia). The differences between the predictions of the two generators are taken as additional systematic uncertainties. Additional uncertainties in the V + jets shape are estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales by factors of 2 and 0.5, and by varying the scale used in Sherpa for matching the matrix elements to the parton showers [39] from its nominal value of 20 GeV to alternative values of 15 GeV and 30 GeV. In the W V \u2192 \u03bdjj channel, the uncertainty in the shapes of the V + jets predictions due to the two kinematic reweighting functions (see Sect. 7.1) is estimated by including the full difference between applying and not applying each reweighting function as additional systematic uncertainties. In the W V \u2192 \u03bdjj channel, an uncertainty of 10% in the (W + jets)/(Z + jets) cross-section ratio is also included; this uncertainty is ignored in the W V \u2192 \u03bdJ channel as it has a negligible effect.",

This figure also shows the expected enhancement at high p T (V rec ) in the presence of different EFT parameter values. As can be seen from the figure, no significant deviation from the SM prediction is observed; there-  fore, 95% confidence intervals are computed for the aTGC and EFT parameters. The confidence intervals are computed from binned ML fits to the p T (V rec ) distributions. The intervals are calculated using a frequentist Feldman-Cousins approach [79]. In the W V \u2192 \u03bdjj channel, simultaneous fits to the p T (V rec ) distributions in the signal region and sideband CR are used, while in the W V \u2192 \u03bdJ channel, only the p T (V rec ) distribution in the signal region is used.

In the fits, the SM W V and background predic-tions are allowed to vary within their uncertainties. The measured cross sections of Sect. 10 are consistent with theoretical SM W V predictions, but have large associated uncertainties; for this reason the theoretical prediction is used here. The systematic uncertainties in the normalizations and p T (V rec ) shapes of the signal and backgrounds are accounted for through nuisance parameters.

Confidence intervals for the aTGC parameters are shown for FF = 5 TeV and for the case of no form factor (equivalent to FF = \u221e). The value of FF = 5 TeV is chosen in order to ensure unitarity over the range of aTGC parameter values to which this analysis is sensitive [80].

When computing the confidence regions for two parameters, the third EFT parameter is held fixed to zero ments of the cross-section at high p T of the bosons. No evidence is found for new physics, and 95% confidence intervals are computed for anomalous coupling parameters. The constraints on new physics are also interpreted in terms of an effective field theory. The W V \u2192 \u03bdJ channel is found to be significantly more sensitive to the new-physics parameters than the W V \u2192 \u03bdjj channel, which demonstrates the power of large-radius jet substructure techniques. The constraints from this analysis on the new physics parameters are comparable to the previous most stringent constraints from other diboson analyses.  ",
