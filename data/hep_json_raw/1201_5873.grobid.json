Although the current knowledge of the top quark comes largely from Tevatron measurements, the experiments at the LHC are poised to probe top-quark production and decay in unprecedented regimes. Although no current top quark measurements conclusively contradict predictions from the standard model, the precision of most measurements remains statistically limited. Additionally, some measurements, most notably A FB in top quark pair production, show tantalizing hints of beyond-the-Standard-Model dynamics. The top quark sample is growing rapidly at the LHC, with initial results now public. This review examines the current status of top quark measurements in the particular light of searching for evidence of new physics, either through direct searches for beyond the standard model phenomena or indirectly via precise measurements of standard model top quark properties.",

Yet, it also marked the beginning of the quest to understand why the top quark is so different from the other quarks. The very feature that allowed the top quark to evade experimental detection for so long-its extraordinarily high mass-is also the cause of most of its unusual properties. The 173.2 GeV/c 2 mass of the top quark [1] makes it roughly forty times more massive than the next most massive quark, the bottom quark, and a e-mail: chris.neu@virginia.edu over 10 000 times more massive than the up quark. Perhaps even more striking is that, as a fundamental object believed to possess no internal structure, the top quark is more massive than the first seventy-four elements in the periodic table.",

Foremost, because the top quark is more massive than the W boson, top quark decays proceed rapidly through the electroweak interaction via an on-shell W before the top quark has a chance to form a hadronic bound state. This makes the top quark the only quark whose properties can be studied without the complications of disentangling hadronization effects. Furthermore, because |V tb | \u223c 1 in the Standard Model, the top quark decays to a W boson and a b almost 100 % of the time, producing a signature quite distinct from the collimated hadronic jets that signal the production of lighter quarks. Finally, as a result of its large mass, a significant fraction (roughly 70 % in the Standard Model) of the W bosons produced in top quark decays are longitudinally polarized.",

            "text": "Beyond the phenomenological implications, the large top quark mass raises deeper questions. In the Standard Model, quark masses arise from the quarks' couplings to the Higgs boson. The large top quark mass implies the top quark has a particularly large coupling to the Higgs boson. In fact, the specific value of the top quark mass implies a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs very near unity. From this perspective it might be more appropriate to ask why the rest of the quarks have such an unnaturally small coupling to the Higgs rather than asking why the top quark mass is so large. Regardless of whether the Higgs mechanism provides the correct explanation for the electroweak symmetry breaking, the large top quark mass raises the possibility that the top quark may have some special connection to or play some special role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Several alternative models to the Higgs picture of electroweak symmetry breaking, such as the top quark see-saw theory [2] or top-color-assisted technicolor [3] posit such a role for the top quark.",

Strategies in the search for new physics associated with the top quark fall broadly into two categories: First there are the direct searches for new physics associated with top quark production or decay. Examples include searching for new heavy resonances decaying into top quarks or searching for new particles produced in top quark decays. An alternative strategy is to measure properties of the top quark predicted within the Standard Model, such as its production cross section, both inclusively and differentially, as well as its decay branching fractions, looking for deviations compared to the Standard Model predictions. This review considers analyses of both types and summarizes the current experimental picture of top quark physics.",

            "text": "It is impossible to relate the tale of the top quark without mentioning the two accelerators that to date are the only locations where top quarks have been produced in a laboratory setting. The first accelerator to produce top quarks was the Tevatron located at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois in the United States. The Tevatron collides protons with antiprotons in a 6.28 km circumference ring. When it began colliding beams operations in 1985, the center of mass energy was 1.8 TeV, and before the end of the first collider run, referred to as Run I, it had achieved instantaneous luminosities in excess of 1.1 \u00d7 10 31 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . Nearly ten years after the start of Tevatron operations, the CDF [4][5][6][7] and D0 [8] experiments jointly announced first observation of top quark pair production using 67 pb \u22121 and 50 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity respectively [9,10]. Shortly after the top quark observation, the Tevatron shut down for upgrades both to the maximum beam energy and luminosity, and in 2001, the second Tevatron run, known as Run II, began, with a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. Roughly eight years later, with a dataset corresponding to 3.2 fb \u22121 at CDF and 2.1 fb \u22121 at D0, both experiments announced observation of production of single top quarks through the electroweak interaction [11,12]. The long time delay and large difference in dataset size needed for the observation of single top quark production compared to top quark pair production is a testament to the experimental difficulty of extracting the small single top signal from the large backgrounds. On Sep. 30, 2011, after 26 years of colliding beams, the Tevatron accelerator ceased operations. Over that time period, the Tevatron delivered an integrated luminosity of almost 12 fb \u22121 and achieved instantaneous luminosities as high as 4.1 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . A wide range of top quark analysis continues to be pursued using this dataset both at CDF and D0.",

Using the roughly 35 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity delivered at 7 TeV in 2010, both ATLAS [13] and CMS [14] experiments measured the top quark pair production cross section. By 2011, electroweak single top quark production had been observed, and the full complement of top quark measurements and searches for new physics were well underway. As of the end of pp running in 2011, the LHC has delivered over 5.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity to the ATLAS and CMS experiments, reaching a maximum instantaneous luminosity of 3.6 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 .

Perhaps most significantly, because of the higher beam energy, and the lack of valence antiquarks in the LHC beams, gluon initiated top production plays a dominant role at the LHC, and processes involving antiquarks, such as pair production through qq annihilation or s-channel single top production, have a smaller cross section. In contrast, at the Tevatron, qq annihilation dominates top pair production. This is particularly relevant for any new physics models where contributions to the top quark sample proceed through qq annihilation. Furthermore, the symmetric nature of the initial state at the LHC means that there is no natural way of defining a \"forward\" or \"backwards\" direction, increasing the challenge of pursuing such measurements as the forward-backward asymmetry A FB in top pair production. Finally, as the LHC luminosities continue to push to ever increasing levels, the LHC is experiencing never before encountered levels of so-called pile-up from additional pp collisions overlapping with the collision of interest. These differences in environment can lead to different measurement strategies being produced at the LHC compared to similar analyses performed at the Tevatron.",

What makes its cross section so low with respect to generic collider inelastic interactions is its very large mass and the fact that it is produced in pairs via the strong interaction, thus probing high x region of PDFs. Top quark pair production at hadron colliders happens through quark-antiquark annihilation and gluongluon fusion. The former is dominant at the Tevatron collider where the valence u(\u016b) quark contribution dominates in the proton (antiproton). There are no\u016b valence quarks in the LHC colliding protons, so the corresponding parton density functions (PDF) are very small. On the other hand only a relatively small fraction of the proton's energy is needed to produce top quarks at the 7 TeV LHC collisions; this energy range is where the gluon PDF dominate. The fraction of top quarks produced through quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion is respectively 85 % (15 %) at the Tevatron and 15 % (85 %) at the LHC. Leading-order Feynman diagrams for top quark productions are shown in Fig. 1. The total cross section is approximately 7.5 pb at the 1.96 TeV pp collisions at the Tevatron, and 160 pb at the 7 TeV pp collisions of the LHC [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].

This production happens through electroweak diagrams in the s-or t-channel, or through associated production with a W boson, as shown in Fig. 2. The respective cross sections at the Tevatron are approximately 1 pb, 2 pb and 0.3 pb [26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. The rise in the cross section at the LHC is again a function of the number of gluons in the initial state: the s-channel production is approximately 5 pb, the t-channel is approximately 64 pb, and the W t production cross sections reaches approximately 16 pb [31,33,34].",

In principle, any sizable deviation in the production rate or in the final state kinematics of top quark events,  would be a sign of new physics. There are several theoretically well-motivated models that would predict new physics affecting top quark samples. A fourth generation of heavy quarks is allowed by the SM fit to the existing precision measurement of electroweak observables, and would allow for the right size of CP violation in the universe [35]. These exotic quarks would appear in detectors very similarly to events with SM top quark production. Heavy resonances, with properties similar to the known vector bosons Z and W that appear for example in dynamical electroweak symmetry-breaking schemes [3,36] would affect either or both pair and single top quark production. Supersymmetry theory (SUSY) in combination with the existing collider constraints on SUSY suggest that the supersymmetric partners of the third generation quarks could be the lightest SUSY squarks [37]. The production and decay of stop quarks would appear kinematically similar to SM top quark production.",

These leptons are then identified offline, requiring p T > 20 GeV, as well as such additional requirements as having a large ratio of electromagnetic to hadronic energy and consistent shower profile for electrons, or a high quality of the track-muon matching for muons. Additional, nontriggered leptons, such as the second lepton in a dilepton event, or leptons collected on jet-and E T -based triggers are allowed to pass looser requirements. Forward muons (1.1 < |\u03b7| < 1.6) and isolated tracks are sometimes used to increase the muon acceptance. To suppress leptons from heavy quark decays or hadrons faking leptons, leptons are often required to be isolated, meaning that the ratio between the E T contained in a cone R < 0.4 around the lepton and the lepton p T is less than 0.1.

D0 supplements these single object triggers with a collection of triggers requiring a single lepton with varying p T thresholds plus a jet. Offline leptons are selected by requiring p T > 20 GeV.

The ANN uses input variables related to the tagged secondary vertex, like the decay length, number of tracks, and invariant mass of the tracks associated to the vertex, to discriminate between real b-jets and tags of jets that do not originate from a b quark (mistags). This ANN variable is typically used as an input to other multivariate analysis methods. The efficiency of the SECVTX algorithm is approximately 45 % with a mistag rate around 1 %. D0 uses b-tagging algorithm that combines variables from several b-tagging approaches using an ANN [43]. This tagging algorithm combines the features of three tagging algorithms: The secondary vertex tagger (SVT) is based on reconstructed vertices, while the jet lifetime probability (JLIP) and counting signed impact parameter (CSIP) taggers are based on tracks with high impact parameters. The JLIP tagger computes a probability for the jet to originate from the primary vertex, while the CSIP tagger requires a certain number of high-impact-parameter tracks. The ANN tagger uses variables related to each of these algorithms, such as the significance of the decay length of the secondary vertex, the invariant mass of the tracks included in the vertex, the JLIP probability, and the number of CSIP tracks. By combining information from multiple taggers, the ANN tagger is able to achieve a significantly higher efficiency for a comparable fake rate to the other tagging algorithms. With this tagger, different operating points may be selected to balance efficiency versus mistag rate. For example, the D0 single top analysis uses an operating point that yields 47 % b-jet efficiency for a mistag rate of 0.5 % [44].",

The jet probability (JP) tagger computes the probability that the tracks in the jet come from the primary vertex, using the impact parameters of the tracks. A variant of the JP algorithm, known as the JBP algorithm, gives increased weight to the four tracks with the highest impact parameter. Finally the track counting (TC) algorithm is based on counting the number of tracks with significant impact parameters.

At CDF and D0, the E T calculated from the raw calorimeter energy deposits, and then corrections are applied based on the calibrated energies for reconstructed objects, like jets, photons, and electrons.

Parton-level events generated with these leading-order matrix elements are then fed to a parton shower MC, like PYTHIA or HERWIG to account for the effects of parton shower, hadronization, and the decays of unstable particles. However, there is a double-counting of the phase space that can be populated both by V + N parton events and V + (N \u2212 1) parton events with hard radiation from the parton shower.

Although this signature has the smallest branching fraction (around 5 % after neglecting events with taus), it provides by far the cleanest signature. The two energetic, isolated charged leptons from the two W bosons decays make this signature easy to trigger on, and the significant amount of E T from two neutrinos and the two energetic b-jets make this channel easy to separate from the main backgrounds. Drell-Yan production is the dominant background; because it is difficult to predict accurately the E T tails, this background is often extracted from data by looking at the E T tails around the Z boson mass peak. Another challenging background that frequently is extracted from data, is the background for fake leptons. Events from the W + jets process can be reconstructed in the dilepton final state if one of the jets in the event fakes a charged lepton of opposite sign to the charged lepton from the W decay. In addition, QCD multijets will contribute if there are two jets providing oppositesign charged lepton fakes. Despite these backgrounds, it is common for dilepton event selections to achieve signal to background ratios in excess of 2:1 with channels like the double-b-tagged e\u03bc sample having virtually no background. Aside from the lack of statistics, the main challenge of using the dilepton channel comes from the presence of two neutrinos whose four-momenta cannot be measured.",

Other preliminary high statistics Tevatron results are available with competitive or superior sensitivity but are not included here. Further complicating matters is that some recent Run II published results make a different assumption for the mass of the top quark, m t ; since the acceptance for tt events is dependent on m t , the measured \u03c3 tt must be quoted at some assumed m t value. Here we chose to only include results here that make the same assumption (m t = 172.5 GeV/c 2 ) as the main +jets and dilepton analyses to facilitate comparison.

The prediction from NLO theory indicates that \u03c3 NLO tt = 157 \u00b1 24 pb [15][16][17]20]; each of the results in Table 2 is consistent with this NLO prediction within 1\u03c3 total uncertainty. The best current measure- ment at the LHC comes from the +jets channel at CMS in an analysis that exploited b-tagging in event classification. This technique extracted the tt content of the selected sample through a profile likelihood fit to the number of total reconstructed jets, the number of b-tagged jets, and the secondary vertex mass distribution in the data. The main systematic uncertainties are taken into account when maximizing the profile likelihood, hence the systematic uncertainty on the measured tt cross section is reduced with respect to more conventional techniques. Under these conditions, this result achieves a sensitivity to \u03c3 tt comparable to that of NLO theory. All these 2010 LHC results will soon be eclipsed in terms of sensitivity by the results from the full 2011 LHC data sample. At the time of preparation of this Review, all of the 2011 results remain preliminary. With the high statistics 2011 data samples, reduction of systematic uncertainty will be the top priority in all measurements of \u03c3 tt .",

The top quark mass gives large contribution to electroweak radiative corrections, and can be used together with other electroweak observables to infer the Higgs boson mass in both SM and non-SM scenarios [95]. The improvement in the precision on the top quark mass measurement in the recent years has narrowed significantly the mass range for the existence of the SM Higgs boson. Also, the precise measurement of this parameter is of crucial importance as it determines many of the other properties of the top quark: as an example, the dependence of the theoretical computation of \u03c3 tt from the top quark mass is \u22483 %/(GeV/c 2 ).",

Beyond LO QCD, the mass of the top quark is a convention-dependent parameter, the other dominant convention being the MS scheme. To probe further into this ambiguity, the D0 and ATLAS collaborations compared the measured inclusive tt production cross section with fully inclusive calculations at higher-order QCD that involve an unambiguous definition of M top and compares the results to MC [106,107].

A measurement of this quantity would test pQCD and EWK calculations, while deviations from this value could be induced by decays of top quarks to non-SM particles such as scalar top partners, charged Higgs, or FCNC decays. The decay width of an unstable particle can be measured in principle from its mass spectrum. The width of the reconstructed top quark mass distribution is dominated by the jet energy resolution, and is typically of the order of tens of GeV at current experiments. While \u0393 t is far smaller than the experimental resolution on m reco t , the shape of the mass spectrum retains some dependence on the top quark width. The CDF collaboration utilized the top quark mass spectrum to measure \u0393 t . The in situ calibration of the jet energy scale using the hadronically decaying W boson is performed to suppress the otherwise dominant jet energy scale uncertainty [112]. Using 4.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, CDF reports the 68 % CL interval to be 0.3 < \u0393 t < 4.4 GeV. A more precise measurement of the total width can be obtained from the equation \u0393 t = \u0393 (t \u2192 W b)/BR(t \u2192 W b), where the partial width \u0393 (t \u2192 W b) is measured through the total production cross section of single top events, and BR(t \u2192 W b) is measured in top quark pair events [113]. This technique assumes that the tW b coupling leading to single top quark production is identical to the coupling leading to top quark decay. The D0 collaboration used as input the measurement of BR(t \u2192 W b) that utilized \u223c1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data [114], and the measurement of the t-channel single top quark cross section that uses 2.3 fb \u22121 of data [115] to measure \u0393 t = 1.99 +0.69 \u22120.55 [116]. It is interesting to note that the D0 collaboration recently released a newer and more precise result for the measurement of BR(t \u2192 W b)/BR(t \u2192 W q) that utilizes five times more data, observing a value of 0.90 \u00b1 0.04 [117]. This measurement corresponds to approximately a 2.5\u03c3 deviation from the SM prediction: it will thus be interesting to see the same measurement performed by the CDF, ATLAS and CMS collaborations.",

Selected events are divided into \"tagged\" and \"untagged\" subsamples based on the presence of a b-tagged jet, and all events are used. The W boson helicity fractions are extracted using the cosine W boson helicity angle cos \u03b8 * , which is defined by the angle between the down type quark from the W boson decay and the opposite of the top quark direction in the W boson rest frame. To reconstruct the undetected neutrino kinematics, both the W boson and top quark mass constraints are utilized, and experimental resolution on the detected leptons, jets, and missing transverse energy are accounted for. Ambiguities in the solution coming from jetto-lepton pairs and kinematics are resolved by taking the most probable solution (considering detector resolution) that gives the smallest effect invariant mass for the tt system. D0 has performed a measurement of the W boson helicity in top decays. This result uses data corresponding to 5.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from both the lepton + jets and dilepton channels [125]. For the lepton + jets data, events are selected with at least four jets, and two of them are required to be b-tagged. The signal purity of both the lepton + jets and the dilepton channels is enhanced using a multivariate likelihood variable to select a subsample enhanced in top quark content. As with the previous measurement, the W boson helicity fractions are extracted from the cos \u03b8 * distribution. For the lepton + jets channel, the undetected neutrino is reconstructed using a kinematic fit incorporating both W boson mass and top quark mass constraints. In the dilepton channel, the reconstruction of the two undetected neutrinos is accomplished using a technique similar to the CDF dilepton measurement. The individual results are combined using the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) technique [126,127] which is capable of accounting for correlations in the systematic uncertainties. The results are calculated two ways: (1) the model independent (or 2D) approach where no assumptions are made about the individual helicity fractions beyond the requirement that they sum to 1, and (2) the model dependent (or 1D) approach where either the longitudinal (f 0 ) or righthanded (f + ) is assumed to have the SM expected value, and the value of the other quantity is extracted (again, assuming the sum of all fractions is 1). Table 3 summarizes the results  obtained. ATLAS has also measured the W helicity using both lepton + jets and dilepton events in data corresponding to 0.7 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity [128]. Lepton + jets events were required to have at least one b-tagged jet, while no btagging requirement was applied to the dilepton channel. For lepton + jets events, the neutrino kinematics were reconstructed using a constrained kinematic fit, while the neutrinos in dilepton events were reconstructed solving a set of constraint equations, choosing the solution that gives the smallest product of transverse neutrino momenta. The W helicity fractions are extracted from the cos \u03b8 * distribution. The results obtained are listed in Table 4. In addition to extracting the W helicity fractions, the ATLAS data are used to extract limits on anomalous couplings at the W tb vertex.",

Hence, through this measurement, the zero spin correlation hypothesis in tt production is ruled out for the first time. The result still suffers from large uncertainties; as it is statistically limited, updated spin correlation results from both Tevatron experiments exploiting the full Run II data sample would be very welcome. It should be noted that the strength of the spin correlation is predicted to be different at NLO for qq annihilation and gg fusion production of top-quark pairs [135]. Hence, given the dominance of gg-fusion-induced tt at the LHC, measurements at CMS and ATLAS provide an important complement to the suite of Tevatron measurements, yielding new insight top-quark pair production. Top-quark spin correlation studies have been undertaken in the early data samples at the LHC [136]. The techniques employed for measuring the spin correlation are qualitatively similar to those employed in the Tevatron analyses. These early LHC results have not yet been published at the time of the preparation of this Review; however, the preliminary results from the LHC indicate that the observed level of spin correlation between top-quark pairs at the LHC is not inconsistent with SM expectations.",

Using 4.8 fb \u22121 of data, the CDF experiment sets a 95 % C.L. limit on the mass of the Z at m Z < 900 GeV/c 2 [143]. This analysis selects events in the lepton + jets topology and increases the signal purity by requiring at least four jets, at least one of which must be b-tagged. The sensitivity of this analysis is improved using a matrix element technique in which the SM tt matrix element is used to construct a per event probability density function for m tt . CDF performs a similar analysis in the all-hadronic final state with 2.8 fb \u22121 of data and obtains a 95 % exclusion of Z \u2192 tt production for m Z < 805 GeV/c 2 [144]. D0 excludes Z production at the 95 % C.L. for m Z < 835 GeV/c 2 using 5.3 fb \u22121 of data [145].

The most common example of such a resonance is a heavy W boson that arises in a number of extensions to the SM [152][153][154][155][156][157][158][159]. Both D0 and CDF search for such new states by looking for evidence of a resonance in the reconstructed tb invariant mass distribution. Both analyses looks at data selected in the lepton + jets final state requiring a single energetic electron or muon and two or more reconstructed jets. The CDF analysis uses a dataset corresponding to 1.9 fb \u22121 and requires events to have two or three jets, with at least one jet being b-tagged [160]. Using the reconstructed tb invariant mass directly, this analysis excludes the production of a right-handed W for M(W ) < 800 GeV/c 2 . The D0 analysis uses 2.3 fb \u22121 of data, and incorporates events with two, three, and four jets, with one or two of the jets being identified as coming from a b quark [161]. To maximize sensitivity, each of the distinct signatures in terms of number of jets and number of b-tagged jets is analyzed separately. A boosted decision tree (BDT) is used to further increase sensitivity. The BDT incorporates input variables related to the tb reconstructed mass, and kinematic properties of the individual reconstructed objects. This analysis excludes W masses below 863 GeV/c 2 to 916 GeV/c 2 depending on the assumptions about the allowed W helicity and the existence of a right-handed neutrino with mass less than the W mass. The lowest mass exclusion M(W ) < 863 GeV/c 2 comes in the case of a purely right-handed W with m(\u03bd R ) < M(W ), analogous to the scenario used for the CDF limit. Allowing theeW to have both left-and right-handed couplings increases the exclusion to its highest value: M(W ) < 916 GeV/c 2 .",

D0 provides the asymmetry measured in the lab frame using the charge times rapidity q y from the leptonic W decay to determine the rapidity of the top quark in the lab frame. The D0 measurement A FB = 0.152 \u00b1 0.040 can be compared to the prediction obtained using MC@NLO for this quantity, A FB = 0.021 \u00b1 0.001. CDF reconstructs the asymmetry in the lab frame using the charge of the lepton from the lepton W boson decay times the rapidity of the fully hadronically decaying top quark q y h . The CDF result A pp FB = 0.150 \u00b1 0.055 can be compared to the corresponding prediction from MCFM of A pp FB = 0.38 \u00b1 0.006. Both D0 and CDF also report asymmetries observed at various stages of event reconstruction and correction. Of particular interest are asymmetries measured in sub-samples divided by y or M tt where new physics effects may be enhanced. CDF sees a 3.4 standard deviation excess in A FB compared to SM expectations computed at NLO for events with M tt \u2265 450 GeV/c 2 . D0 investigates the asymmetry as a function of | y| and M tt at the reconstructed event level (i.e. not corrected for detector acceptance and resolution) and sees no statistically significant excesses.",

Events are selected on the basis of having two energetic leptons (electrons or muons), two energetic jets, and a large amount of missing transverse energy. This analysis does not employ b-tagging. Reconstruction of the full tt system proceeds using a kinematic fitter, but the process is complicated by the presence of two undetected neutrinos. Even applying the W -boson and top quark mass constraints leave the system underconstrained. This challenge is addressed by incorporating additional constraints on p tt z , p tt T , and M tt using probability density functions derived from SM expectations. The result is corrected for detector acceptance, efficiency, and resolution, yielding A tt = 0.42 \u00b1 0.15 (stat.) \u00b1 0.05 (syst.).

The measurement of the total cross sections for tt has a relative precision of 7 %, better than the current best theoretical determination; its precision can be improved analyzing further data. A better understanding of NNLO QCD computations would be needed in order to extract meaningful information. The uncertainty on the cross section for tt\u03b3 production will benefit from larger datasets. The precision on V tb is now of the order of 8 %; it can be reduced to 5 % using Tevatron only data. A precision beyond this value will require the larger LHC dataset, advanced understanding of the relevant systematics, and improved theoretical predictions. The single best known top quark property is the top quark mass, with a precision now approximately 0.5 %. This goal far surpassed Tevatron estimation for the Run II, and the goal set for the LHC collider experiments. The uncertainty on the top quark mass now translates into a negligible uncertainty on other top quark properties measurements, thus allowing stringent comparisons of the experimentally determined quantities against SM predictions. The current precision on M top translates into such a precision in the prediction of the Higgs boson mass that this prediction is now limited by the precision on the measurement of the W boson mass. The precision on the measurement of the difference between top and antitop masses, \u22480.7 %, is limited by the current statistics, where a twofold increase in relative precision will be soon possible. The top quark width has been measured directly and indirectly, with the latter introducing more assumptions but allowing increased precision, now of the order of 30 %. The BR(t \u2192 W b) is measured to a 4 % level. Perhaps most interestingly, the latest measurement shows a deviation of 2.5\u03c3 from SM predictions. This measurement is already limited by the understanding of systematic sources, so an increase in statistics would not change dramatically the picture. The measurement of rare top decays are excluded up to \u224810 \u22123 level. The Tevatron experiments have currently reached sensitivity to the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in tt events. This is currently the only place where the experimental determination deviates from the SM predictions by more than 3\u03c3 . More work is needed both on the theoretical and on the experimental side to understand whether this is a statistical fluctuation, an underestimation of the SM computation, or the first sign of new physics in top quark events. Measuring the same quantity for b and c quarks would also help to clarify the situation [171,172]. The LHC measurements of the top charge asymmetry is in reasonable agreement with the SM prediction. Still, due to the different initial state at the LHC pp collider with respect to the Tevatron pp collider, the two measurement provide different sensitivity to new physics scenarios.",

This projection relies on the LHC reaching instantaneous luminosities of at least 5 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . Of course, reaching this goal will require passing through a number of intermediate phases [173,174]: 2012: As of this writing the proposal for 2012 is to increase the LHC center of mass energy to 8 TeV and to accumulate an integrated luminosity in the range of 10-16 fb \u22121 . To achieve the high end of these projections the LHC peak instantaneous luminosity would need to increase by approximately a factor of two. \u223c2015-2020: After a shutdown lasting between one and two years to repair the magnet splices, the LHC would begin running again at center of mass energy somewhere between 13 TeV and 14 TeV. Planning to reach peak instantaneous luminosities up to 2 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , the LHC should deliver an integrated luminosity starting around 20-30 fb \u22121 in the first year, and eventually reaching as high as \u223c100 fb \u22121 . \u223c2021-2030: After another shutdown for upgrades to increase the LHC luminosity, as well as to improve the detectors ability to handle high pileup environments, the LHC will begin running in a new high luminosity regime. In this era, peak instantaneous luminosities would reach as high as 5 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , corresponding to on the order of 100 pileup pp interactions per bunch crossing.

Many analysis techniques and tools useful for top quark physics have been tested and refined. The top quark mass has been measured with very large precision (<1 %) and the experimental precision of the top quark pair production cross section now surpasses the theoretical one. The study of other top quark properties, as well as the direct search for new physics involving top quarks has largely advanced, but still they are mostly statistically limited. The top quark as of today appears to be mostly the one predicted by the SM, with the notable exception of the anomalously large forward-backward asymmetry, showing multiple deviation at the 3\u03c3 level from the NLO prediction, and confirmed by both Tevatron experiments. This is the most compelling example of the uniqueness of the pp collisions at the Tevatron.

Several measurements already surpassed in precision previous Tevatron results, and tools for the exploration of NP beyond the TeV scale in top events have been tested successfully. With the ever-increasing dataset, the search for rare top decays will become increasingly important, as well as the production of top quarks together with heavy vector bosons (W/Z), and eventually with the Higgs. All of the above measurements would test stringently the SM, while any deviation would be a clear sign of new physics. Direct searches for new physics will allow soon the observation or exclusion conclusively of the existence of 4 th generation quarks, as well as the existence of SUSY scalar partners of top quarks.
