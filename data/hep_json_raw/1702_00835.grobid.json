The corresponding four structure functions d\u03c3L/dt, d\u03c3T /dt, d\u03c3LT /dt and d\u03c3T T /dt are extracted as a function of the momentum transfer to the recoil system at Q 2 =1.75 GeV 2 and xB=0.36. The ed \u2192 ed\u03c0 0 cross sections are found compatible with the small values expected from theoretical models. The en \u2192 en\u03c0 0 cross sections show a dominance from the response to transversely polarized photons, and are in good agreement with calculations based on the transversity GPDs of the nucleon. By combining these results with previous measurements of \u03c0 0 electroproduction off the proton, we present a flavor decomposition of the u and d quark contributions to the cross section.",

            "text": "Understanding the internal three-dimensional structure of nucleons in terms of quarks and gluons is a major challenge of modern hadronic physics. Two complementary approaches have been used in the past in order to achieve this goal. On the one hand, nucleon form factors (FFs) measured in elastic electron scattering provide information on the transverse charge and current distributions inside the nucleon [1]. On the other hand, parton distribution functions (PDFs) measured in Deeply Inelastic Scattering (DIS) characterize the longitudinal momentum distribution of the underlying quarks and gluons [2]. Twenty years ago, FFs and PDFs were unified within the formalism of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) [3][4][5]. GPDs are universal functions encoding a wealth of information about the nucleon internal structure such as the correlation between the transverse position of quarks and gluons (partons) and their longitudinal momenta [6]. GPDs also provide access to the contribution of quark and gluon orbital angular momenta to the nucleon spin [4]. Eight GPDs for each quark flavor q describe nucleon structure at leading order in 1/Q (twist-2). They correspond to each combination of nucleon and parton helicities. The four chiral-even GPDs (H q , E q , H q and E q ) conserve the helicity of the parton whereas the four chiral-odd, or transversity GPDs (H q T , E q T , H q T and E q T ), flip the parton helicity [7,8]. GPDs parametrize the structure of the target independently of the reaction [7]. Chiral-even GPDs can be accessed experimentally via hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) and deeply virtual meson electroproduction (DVMP) in the Bjorken limit Q 2 \u2192 \u221e and t/Q 2 1 at fixed x B . Recent results on DVCS show the validity of this limit at values of Q 2 as low as 1.5 GeV 2 [9][10][11]. In the case of DVMP, the longitudinal scattering amplitude factorizes into a hard perturbative contribution and a soft convolution of the nucleon GPDs and the meson distribution amplitude (DA). The transverse virtual photo-production amplitude is proven to be suppressed by a factor of 1/Q 2 at sufficiently high values of Q 2 [12]. In the case of \u03c0 0 electroproduction, it was suggested in [13,14] that a large contribution to the transverse amplitude could arise from the convolution of the transversity GPDs of the nucleon with a twist-3 quark-helicity flip pion DA. Model calculations including the transversity GPDs have successfully described recent \u03c0 0 electroproduction data on a proton target, measured   2 , where m \u03c0 0 is the \u03c0 0 mass, q = q1 + q2 and the c.m. superscript refers to the target\u2212\u03c0 0 center-ofmass frame.",

In JLab Hall A experiment E08-025, we measured the D(e, e \u03c0 0 )X reaction, with the primary goal of extracting the n(e, e\u03c0 0 )n cross section in the quasi-free approximation. We perform a Rosenbluth separation, based on data taken with incident beam energies E = 4.455 ( = 0.65) and 5.550 GeV ( = 0.79). A 15-cm-long liquid deuterium (LD2) target was used as a quasi-free neutron target. The quasi-free \u03c0 0 electroproduction events off the proton are subtracted using the data from experiment E07-007 [18], similarly to the analysis of DVCS off the neutron in [21]. These two experiments ran concurrently with liquid hydrogen (LH2) and LD2 targets interchanged daily to minimize systematic uncertainties. Scattered electrons were detected with 10 \u22124 momentum resolution in the left High Resolution Spectrometer (HRS) of Hall A [22], which determined accurately the electron scattering kinematics centered at x B = 0.36 and Q 2 = 1.75 GeV 2 .

A 3.1% energy resolution at 3.16 GeV and a 0.6 ns \u03c0 0 -electron coincidence time resolution was achieved by means of a 1 GHz flash ADC system in each calorimeter channel. The calibration of the calorimeter was performed with elastic H(e,e Calo p HRS ) data from dedicated runs in which the scattered electrons were detected in the calorimeter, with energy predetermined by the kinematics of the elastic recoil proton in the HRS.

The virtual internal effects are applied as a global correction factor to the extracted cross sections. The HRS acceptance is modeled by an R-function [27] defining correlated multi-dimensional boundaries. Only the overlapping (Q 2 ,x B ) phase-space between the two beam energy settings is considered. The calorimeter energy resolution in the p(e, e \u03c0 0 )p simulation is smeared to match the M 2 X distribution in each (E, t , \u03c6) bin of the LH2 data. These bin-by-bin resolution smearing factors are also applied to the n(e, e \u03c0 0 )n and d(e, e \u03c0 0 )d simulated data. The Fermi-smearing described above is also applied to the simulated n(e, e \u03c0 0 )n yields. The systematic uncertainty of this smearing procedure as well the asymmetric systematic uncertainty originated from the inclusive yield under the M 2 X cut are evaluated by varying the cut applied around its nominal value.

The highest t bin is used in the analysis to treat bin migration effects and is not shown herein. The figure again shows the clear separation of the neutron signal. The coherent deuteron cross sections are found to be very small and compatible with theoretical calculations based on chiraleven deuteron GPDs, which predict cross-section values smaller than 1 nb/GeV 2 in similar kinematics [28]. Fig. 5 shows the four extracted structure functions for the neutron and the deuteron as functions of t . The neutron cross sections are dominated by d\u03c3 n T /dt and d\u03c3 n T T /dt, while the terms involving a longitudinal re- sponse are compatible with zero within uncertainties and are in good agreement with previous results off a proton target at the same kinematics [18]. The neutron measurements are compared to a calculation based on both quark helicity-conserving GPDs and quark helicity-flip (transversity) GPDs [14], and show good agreement for all structure functions, with a slight overestimation of |d\u03c3 n T T /dt|. The experimental d\u03c3 n L /dt term is also compatible with the VGG model [29] based on chiral-even GPDs, which predicts d\u03c3 n L /dt < 4 nb/GeV 2 for all t bins. Together with previous measurements of d\u03c3 T /dt and d\u03c3 T T /dt on the proton [18] and extensive unseparated measurements before [15][16][17], these new results provide strong support to the exciting idea that transversity GPDs can be accessed via neutral pion electroproduction in the high Q 2 regime.",

The unknown relative phase between the u and d convolutions is treated as a systematic uncertainty in the separation. The flavorseparated results assuming no relative phase between the u and d convolutions are presented in Fig. 6, with the bands indicating their variation when the phase takes all possible values between 0 and \u03c0. This phase could be resolved with exclusive p(\u03b3 * , \u03b7p) data in the same kinematics [30]. Fig. 6 shows that the magnitudes of the u-quark convolutions are larger than the d-quark convolutions for all t bins. The results in Fig. 6 also demonstrate that the  u-quark nucleon helicity non-flip term \u0112 u T , is larger than the nucleon helicity flip term | H u T |. The comparison to the Goloskokov-Kroll model [14] shows good agreement for | H T | for both quark flavors but an underestimation for \u0112 u T . The GPD H T parametrization is constrained in the forward limit by the transversity parton distributions. However, no similar experimental constraint is available for\u0112 T . The constraints on\u0112 T are mainly taken from lattice QCD calculations [31].",

Similar measurements are obtained for coherent \u03c0 0 electroproduction off the deuteron at x B =0.18. The latter are found to be very small and according to theoretical expectations. Neutron results show a dominance of the transverse response confirming the transversity GPD approach for the description of this process. By combining neutron and proton results, we have performed the first flavor decomposition of the u and d quark contributions to the cross section. Additional information from \u03b7 meson electroproduction will soon help constraint the relative phase between the u and d quark contributions.",
