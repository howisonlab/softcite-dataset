The AFTER@LHC proposal combines a unique kinematic coverage and large luminosities thanks to the Large Hadron Collider beams to deliver precise measurements, complementary to the knowledge provided by collider experiments such as at RHIC. In this paper, we report on sensitivity studies for J/\u03c8, \u03a5 and Drell-Yan A N done using the performance of LHCb-like or ALICE-like detectors, combined with polarised gaseous hydrogen and helium-3 targets. In particular, such analyses will provide us with new insights and knowledge about transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions for quarks and gluons and on twist-3 collinear matrix elements in the proton and the neutron.",

It has been a topic of intense theoretical and experimental studies since the European Muon Collaboration reported that the spin of constituent quarks only accounts for a small fraction of the observed spin, 1/2 [1]. Nowadays, it is accepted that both quarks and gluons as well as their relative motion, via the orbital angular momentum (OAM), contribute to the nucleon spin. For instance, in the case of a longitudinally polarised nucleon, i.e. with helicity + 1 2 , the spin is given by a sum rule",

Recent experimental data have shown that the spin distributions of quarks and antiquarks only account for about 25% of proton total longitudinal spin [2], and that of the gluons for about 20% for x > 0.05 [3], yet compatible with zero. The remaining proton spin therefore should arise from the relative dynamics of quarks and gluons, i.e. via L q and L g .

Naturally, quarkonium production can serve as such a tool, since the gluon fusion is the dominant contribution to these processes in high-energy hadron collisions (see [6][7][8] for RHIC energies). Thanks to many different experiments performed in the last decades (for reviews see [9][10][11]), measuring quarkonia via leptonic decays became a relatively straightforward task. The downside remains a lower production cross-section compared to light mesons, which calls for large integrated luminosities. Lastly, accessing transverse-spin physics research requires a polarised target. However, the interest in such studies [12] is growing.",

Indeed, the PHENIX collabration [13] pioneered the studies of p \u2191 p \u2192 J/\u03c8 X . The precision of the measurement is however very limited and did not allow to claim for a nonzero STSA, or to constrain L g . The COMPASS detector is probably the other existing experimental set-up where quarkonium STSA can be measured. Measurements of other quarkonium states are extremely important. First, J/\u03c8 production involves a complicated pattern of feed downs and vector quarkonium production is not the easiest case to analyse theoretically. C-even quarkonia (\u03c7 c,b , \u03b7 c ) which can be produced alone without recoiling gluons indeed offer some advantages. We refer to [14][15][16][17] for more details.",

However all of them can be expressed in terms of only two independent functions [94,96], which will appear in different combinations depending on the process. AFTER@LHC will prove to be extremely useful in disentangling them and testing this generalised universality. Drell-Yan lepton-pair production is the golden process to access the intrinsic transverse motion of quarks in a nucleon. However, there is no analogous process, which is at the same time experimentally clean and theoretically well-controlled, to probe the gluon content. One of the best tools at our disposal is the production of quarkonium states and open heavy-flavour mesons, a major strength of AFTER@LHC. They provide final states with a typical invariant mass (M Q ) which is, on the one hand, small enough to be sensitive to the intrinsic transverse momenta of gluons (k T ), and on the other, large enough to realise the hierarchy of scales (M Q k T ), and thus to allow for the TMD formalism to be applied without pollution from higher-twist effects. To this extent, production of C-even states can be fruitfully investigated [15,16,20,24,86,97].",

LHCb is a multi-purpose, single arm detector with a precise microvertexing instrumentation, particle identification systems, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. It has capabilities for an accurate primary and secondary vertex location determination, for a particle identification (including \u03c0, K , p, e and \u03bc) with a good momentum resolution and a high rate data acquisition system. LHCb has already successfully run in the fixed-target mode using its luminosity monitor SMOG (System for Measuring the Overlap with Gas) [108] as a gas target. However, the data taking was done over limited periods of time and limited gas pressures. Additional feasibility studies are needed to address the possibility of installing a polarised gas target. The simulation setup we will use for a LHCb-like detector is described in detail in [35]. We therefore only outline here the most relevant information for Drell-Yan and J/\u03c8 , \u03a5 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 measurements, namely: the single muon tracking and the identification efficiency is \u223c98% and the kinematic acceptance is 2 < \u03b7 < 5 and a p T threshold is set at p T > 0.7 GeV/c. However, for the studies presented in this paper, we used a more stringent cut of p T > 1.2 GeV/c which usefully reduces the uncorrelated background.",

The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) [109], which will be installed in the near future, will add tracking capabilities for muon measurements for I P Z = 0. A typical single track p T threshold for di-muon pair analysis with the ALICE Muon Arm is p T > 1 GeV/c [110]. In addition, the muon arm is equipped with an absorber, which reduces the uncorrelated background due to misidentified hadrons in such studies. Moreover, it is possible to install an additional vertexing instrumentation near the interaction point for I P Z = \u22125 m. Such a vertex detector would improve the precision of Drell-Yan measurements by removing the background muons from light-hadron and charm/bottom-hadron decays. Indeed, for I P Z = \u22125 m, the acceptance of the MFT does not match that of the spectrometer.",

We consider the following approach to the A N measurement with di-muon pairs. For the statistical precision evaluation, we assume that the yields \u03c3 \u2191 , \u03c3 \u2193 are separately measured with a standard invariant mass approach used in high energy experiments for quarkonium studies. We construct an invariant mass spectrum of all di-muon pairs (often called foreground) which contains both signal of interest (J/\u03c8, \u03a5 , DY) and random pairs (combinatorial background, B). The background yield B is evaluated with a like sign technique: by taking a sum of mass distributions for \u03bc + \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 , or a geometric mean of like-sign pair yields (2 N \u03bc + \u03bc + N \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 ). Finally, we subtract the background from the foreground to get the signal yield for a given target polarisation in a given kinematical domain. PHENIX used such an approach in J/\u03c8 A N measurement [13] and their study confirmed that the like-sign pairs represent well the yield and polarisation of the uncorrelated background. The statistical uncertainty \u03b4 \u03c3 on the \u03c3 \u2191 , \u03c3 \u2193 is thus given by \u03b4 \u03c3 = \u221a \u03c3 + 2B, and the statistical uncertainty on 2 . The factor 2B in \u03b4 \u03c3 definition accounts for the statistical uncertainty from the combinatorial background subtraction in the A N evaluation. This approach assumes that the luminosities for each polarisation configuration are the same; if not, then the \u03c3 \u2191 , \u03c3 \u2193 need to be corrected for the relative luminosity differences. Similarly, we consider here that the systematic effects (like the detector acceptance) are the same for \u03c3 \u2191 and \u03c3 \u2193 , and will cancel out in the ratio. If they are not, this should be accounted for. We also assume that a microvertexing detector will allow us to remove the correlated background from charm and bottom hadron decays. Thanks to the boost effect, their decay vertex is well separated from the primary collision point and c \u2192 \u03bc and ",

First, the invariant mass spectrum of all \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pairs (M All ) is computed, which includes the signal (correlated pairs), the correlated background (mainly muon pairs from semileptonic decays of charmed and bottom hadrons) and the so-called combinatorial background (uncorrelated, randomly combined muon pairs in the analysis). We applied a single-muon p T threshold of p T > 1.2 GeV/c to reduce the background. We estimated the invariant-mass distribution of the uncorrelated background with the like-sign technique and then subtracted it from M All to account for the statistical uncertainty owing to the background fluctuations. \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 < 0.2, respectively. In addition to the Drell-Yan and quarkonium studies, the double-J/\u03c8 production is of interest because it gives access to the k T evolution of the gluon Sivers function.

            "text": "As we mentioned in the previous section, Drell-Yan production is a unique probe of the Sivers effect for the quarks. It is a subject of lively interest with many existing or planned experiments (COMPASS, STAR, E1039). Table 3 shows a compilation of the relevant parameters of future or planned polarised DY experiments. AFTER@LHC is capable of measuring the Drell-Yan A N in a broad kinematic range with exceptional precision. Figure 5 shows the statistical accuracy expected with a single data-taking year using a LHCb-like detector, for the Drell-Yan pairs satisfying 4 < M \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 < 9 GeV/c 2 . The level of uncorrelated background drives the statistical uncertainties of this Table 3 Compilation inspired from [18,57] of the relevant parameters for the future or planned polarised DY experiments. The effective polarisation (P eff ) is a beam polarisation (where relevant) or an average polarisation times a (possible) dilution factor (for a gas target, similar to the one developed for HERMES [53,115,116]) or a target polarisation times a dilution factor (for the NH 3 target used by COMPASS and E1039). For AFTER@LHC the numbers correspond to a gas target. F is the (instantaneous) spin figure of merit of the target defined as F = P 2 eff \u00d7 L, with L being the instantaneous luminosity   Statistical projections for the Drell-Yan A N measurement as a function of x \u2191 with a LHCb-like detector. Note that the range in x \u2191 is limited by the bin sizes in y and M. We have checked that measurements can probably be done with an accuracy of 5% up to x \u2191 0.95 as expected from Fig. 2 measurement. We estimated the background with the robust and commonly used like-sign technique, then we subtracted it from the M \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 distribution. As explained above, we also assumed that the microvertexing detector allow one to remove the correlated background from charm and bottom pair decays. The AFTER@LHC projections are compared to a theory evaluation [36]. This theory prediction based on SIDIS currently exhibit uncertainties much larger than our projected uncertainties, as shown by this example. By delivering high-quality data over a wide kinematic range, AFTER@LHC will thus probe the x \u2191 dependence of the A DY N and constrain model calculations. Since the statistical precision of A DY N strongly depends on the level of uncorrelated background, such a study can be carried out with lower integrated luminosity if the background is suppressed. The ALICE forward muon arm may provide a set-up with a lower background than a LHCb-like detector since the absorber in front of its muon detector significantly reduces the uncorrelated background. Such an effect is however difficult to simulate precisely. Moreover, the available integrated luminosity is limited by the ALICE data taking rate capabilities. An integrated luminosity of 0.25 fb \u22121 can be expected at best for a single year of data taking.",

            "text": "To check to which extent A DY N can be studied with ALICE and if this deserves further in-depth investigations, we estimated the signal and background yields as follows. First, we assumed that the number of uncorrelated pairs in the DY and charmonium measurements is proportional to the number of charged particles squared, N 2 ch . To take into account the track reconstruction efficiency and the background suppression by the ALICE absorber, we referred to ALICE measurements of the di-muon pairs at forward rapidities in pp collisions at 8 TeV [110]. Since Drell-Yan pairs were not measured by ALICE yet, we turned to J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc + measurements. We calculated the number of uncorrelated pairs N un under the J/\u03c8 peak and the J/\u03c8 yield and we normalised them by the luminosity. Then, we used the scaling of charged track density with the collision energy d N ch /d\u03b7| \u03b7\u223c0 = 0.725( \u221a s) 0.23 [117] to scale down the N un to the level expected at \u221a s = 115 GeV. Next, we used the energy dependence of the J/\u03c8 cross section as calculated in the FONLL (Fixed Order plus Next-to-Leading Logarithms) framework to scale the J/\u03c8 yield to the value expected at 115 GeV -admittedly this is another approximation. We neglected the change of the shape of d N ch /d\u03b7 and d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dy distributions with \u221a s for these first estimates. Finally, we assumed that the reconstruction efficiency for J/\u03c8 and DY pairs was similar and the ratio of observed DY to J/\u03c8 pairs would be the same in ALICE and LHCb. We thus used the correlated di-muon spectrum simulated for LHCb-like detector for 3 < y Lab \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 < 4 and scale it to match the   J/\u03c8 yield in the simulation to that expected in ALICE at 115 GeV. Similarly, we normalised the uncorrelated background under the J/\u03c8 peak in the simulations to the N un estimated for ALICE in a fixed target mode. As a results, we obtained distributions of DY, cc \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , bb \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and uncorrelated background pairs expected in the measurements using the ALICE muon arm. Note that we implicitly assumed the target location to be at z = 0, which is not completely coherent with the location of a polarised target. We nevertheless believe this to be sufficient for such a prospective study. Figure 6 shows the projections for A N measured with the ALICE-like acceptance of 3 < y Lab \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 < 4. The uncertainties are sizeable but there is room for improvement if tracking and vertex detectors before the absorber are used to reject muons from \u03c0, K meson and beauty and charm hadrons decays.",

Figures 7 and 8 show the statistical-uncertainty predictions for DY and quarkonium A N measurements. In the case of 3 He \u2191 , a polarisation of P = 70% can be achieved [115,116]. However, the effective polarisation, P eff , is diluted by a factor of 3 since only the neutron is polarised in the 3 He \u2191 . In addition, the combinatorial background is proportional to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions N coll , thus the background increases by a factor N coll \u2248 \u221a 3.
