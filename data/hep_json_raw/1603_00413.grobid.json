The analysis is based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, collected by the LHCb experiment. The \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039bK + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039bK + K \u2212 decays are observed for the first time and their branching fractions and CP asymmetry parameters are measured.

            "text": "The availability of large samples of high energy pp collision data has allowed significant improvements in the experimental studies of b baryons. The masses and lifetimes of the \u039b 0 b , \u039e 0 b and \u039e \u2212 b particles are all now known to within a few percent or better [1][2][3][4][5], and excited \u039b 0 b and \u039e b baryons have been discovered [6][7][8]. However, relatively few decay modes of the b baryons have yet been studied. In particular, among the possible charmless hadronic final states, only the two-body \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays [9], the quasitwo-body \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03c6 decay [10] and the three-body \u039b 0 b \u2192 K 0 S p\u03c0 \u2212 decay [11] have been observed, while evidence has been reported for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03b7 decay [12]. No decay of a \u039e b baryon to a charmless final state has yet been observed. Such decays are of great interest as they proceed either by tree-level decays involving the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa [13,14] matrix element V ub or by loop-induced amplitudes, and they are consequently expected to have suppressed decay rates in the Standard Model. Their study may also provide insights into the mechanisms of hadronisation in b baryon decays. Moreover, charmless hadronic b baryon decays provide interesting possibilities to search for CP violation effects, as have been seen in the corresponding B meson decays [15][16][17][18][19].",

The LHCb detector [25,26] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area siliconstrip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillatingpad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

These categories are referred to as long and downstream, respectively. During 2011, downstream tracks were not reconstructed in the software trigger. Such tracks were included in the trigger logic during 2012 data-taking; however, a significant improvement in the algorithms was implemented during a technical stop period.

The b baryon candidate must have a good quality vertex, be significantly displaced from the PV, and have p T > 1.5 GeV/c. Furthermore, it must have low values of both \u03c7 2 IP and pointing angle (i.e. the angle between the b baryon momentum vector and the line joining its production and decay vertices), which ensure that it points back to the PV. Additionally, the \u039b and b baryon candidate vertices must be separated by at least 30 mm along the beam direction. The candidates are separated with PID criteria (discussed below) into the three different final states: \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u039bK \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and \u039bK + K \u2212 .

A multibody decay can in general proceed through intermediate states as well as through nonresonant amplitudes. It is therefore necessary to model the variation of the efficiency, and to account for the distribution of signal events, over the phase space of the decay. This is achieved, in a similar way as done for previous studies of b baryon decays [11,44,45], by factorising the efficiency into a two-dimensional function of variables that describe the Dalitz plot [46] and three one-dimensional functions for the angular variables. Simulated events are binned in these variables in order to determine the selection efficiencies. If no significant b baryon signal is seen, the efficiency corresponding to a uniform phase-space distribution is used, and a systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for the variation across the phase space. For modes with a significant yield, the distribution in the phase space is obtained with the sPlot technique [47] with the b baryon candidate invariant mass used as the control variable, and the efficiency corresponding to the observed distribution is used.",

The prior probability distribution for the signal rate is flat, whereas the prior for the background rate is a Gaussian distribution based on the expectation from the maximum likelihood fit, found by extrapolating the combinatorial background component from the fit into the signal region. Both of these prior distributions are truncated to remove the unphysical (negative) region. Log-normal priors are used for the normalisation mode yield, the signal and normalisation channel efficiencies, and all other sources of systematic uncertainty. The posterior probability distribution is obtained by integrating over the nuisance parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo [54]. For consistency, the same method is used to obtain upper limits on the branching fractions of all modes which do not have significant yields.",
