The normalized differential cross sections are measured as a function of the top quark transverse momenta, p T , and compared to predictions from quantum chromodynamics. The results are reported at detector, parton, and particle levels. In all cases, the measured top quark p T spectra are significantly softer than theoretical predictions.",

Measurements of the top quark-antiquark pair (tt) production cross section test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), constrain QCD parameters, and are sensitive to physics beyond the SM. The tt process is also the dominant SM background to many searches for new physical phenomena, and its precise measurement is essential for claiming new discoveries.",

            "text": "The copious top quark data samples produced at the CERN LHC enable measurements of the tt production rate in extended parts of the phase space, and differentially as a function of the kinematic properties of the tt system. Inclusive and differential cross section measurements from proton-proton (pp) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV have been reported by the ATLAS [1-11] and CMS collaborations [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. These are significantly more precise than the measurements of tt production in proton-antiproton collisions performed at the Tevatron [25]. In this paper, we report * e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch new results from pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected with the CMS detector. Measurements of the tt inclusive cross section and the normalized differential cross sections are presented for the first time in the all-jets final state at this collision energy. The results are compared to QCD predictions, and are in agreement with other measurements in different decay channels.",

Events in which both W bosons from the tt decay produce a pair of light quarks constitute the so-called all-jets channel. As a result, the final state consists of at least six partons (more are possible from initial-and final-state radiation), two of which are b quarks. Despite the large number of combinatorial possibilities, it is possible to fully reconstruct the kinematical properties of the tt decay products, unlike in the leptonic channels where the presence of one or two neutrinos makes the full event interpretation ambiguous. However, the presence of a large background from multijet production, and the larger number of jets in the final state make the measurement of the tt cross section in the all-jets final state more uncertain compared to the leptonic channels. Nevertheless, a high-purity signal sample can be selected, which increases significantly the signal-over-background ratio compared to previous measurements in this decay channel [21,26,27].",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Extensive forward calorimetry (pseudorapidity |\u03b7| > 3.0) complements the coverage provided by the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.3) and endcap (1.3 < |\u03b7| < 3.0) detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 300 Hz, before data storage. A detailed description of the CMS apparatus, together with the definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [28].",

The input to the jet clustering algorithm is the collection of particle candidates that are reconstructed with the particle-flow (PF) algorithm [43,44]. In the PF event reconstruction all stable particles in the event, i.e. electrons, muons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons, are reconstructed as PF candidates using a combination of all of the subdetector information to obtain an optimal determination of their directions, energies, and types. All the reconstructed vertices in the event are ordered according to the sum of squared transverse momenta ( p T ) of tracks used to reconstruct it and the vertex with the largest sum is considered the primary one, while all the rest are considered as pileup vertices. In order to mitigate the effect of multiple interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup), charged PF candidates that are unambiguously associated with pileup vertices are removed prior to the jet clustering. This procedure is called charged-hadron subtraction (CHS) [45]. An offset correction is applied for the additional energy inside of the jet due to neutral hadrons or photons from pileup. The resulting jets require a small residual energy correction, mostly due to the thresholds for reconstructed tracks and clusters in the PF algorithm and reconstruction inefficiencies [45].",

Among the six jets with the highest p T (leading jets), at least two must be identified as coming from b hadronization by the CSV algorithm at the medium working point (CSVM), with a typical b quark identification efficiency of 70 % and misidentification probability for light quarks of 1.4 %, and these are considered the most probable b jet candidates. If there are more than two such jets, which happens in approximately 2 % of the events, then the two with the highest p T are chosen. To select events compatible with the tt hypothesis, and to improve the resolution of the reconstructed quantities, a kinematic fit is performed that utilizes the constraints of the tt decay. A \u03c7 2 fit is performed, starting with the reconstructed jet four-momenta, which are varied within their experimental p T and angular resolutions, imposing a W boson mass constraint (80.4 GeV [47]) on the light-quark pairs, and requiring that the top quark and antiquark have equal mass. Out of all the possible combinations from the six input jets, the algorithm returns the one with the smallest \u03c7 2 and the resulting parton four momenta, which are used to compute the reconstructed top quark mass (m rec t ). The probability of the converged kinematic fit is required to be greater than 0.15. Overall, the kinematic fit requirements select approximately 5 % (2 %) of the tt (background) events. The distance in the \u03b7-\u03c6 space between the two b quark candidates must be R bb = ( \u03b7 bb ) 2 + ( \u03c6 bb ) 2 > 2.0, which has an efficiency of roughly 75 % (50 %) on tt (background) events. The last two requirements are applied to select events with unambiguous top quark pair interpretation and to suppress the QCD background that originates from gluon splitting into collinear b quarks [48].",

The resulting sample contains a negligible fraction of tt events (<1 %) and is treated exactly like the signal sample. After applying the R bb > 2.0 and the fit probability requirements, the reconstructed top-like kinematic properties of events with no b jet are very similar to those with two b jets (confirmed using simulated QCD events). We use this QCD-dominated control sample to   extract the shape (templates) of the various kinematic observables. The number of tt events (signal yield) is extracted from a template fit of m rec t to the data using parametrized shapes for signal and background distributions, where the signal shape is taken from the tt simulation and the QCD shape is taken from the control data sample described above. The background and signal yields are determined via a maximum likelihood fit to the m rec t distribution and are used to normalize the corresponding samples. Figures 1 and 2 show the fitted mass and the kinematic fit probability and R bb distributions. The p T distributions of the six leading jets is shown in Fig. 3. From the output of the kinematic fit one can reconstruct the two top quark candidates, whose p T are shown in Fig. 4, and the properties of the tt system (p T , rapidity y) are shown in Fig. 5. Overall, the data sample is dominated by signal events, and the data are in agreement with the fit results. The jet p T spectra in data appear to be systematically softer than in the simulation, in agreement with the observations in Ref.",

            "text": "-Background modeling: the QCD m rec t template shape derived from the data control sample is varied according to the uncertainty of the method evaluated with simulated events, which impacts the extracted signal yield moderately (4.9 %). -Trigger efficiency: the efficiency of the trigger path is taken from the simulation and corrected with an eventby-event scale factor (SF trig ), calculated from data independent samples, that depends on the fourth jet p T . In the phase space of the measurement, the SF trig is greater than 0.83 and on average 0.96. The associated uncertainty is conservatively defined as (1 \u2212 SF trig )/2 and has a small impact (2.0 %) on the cross section. -Jet energy scale and resolution: the jet energy scale (JES) and jet resolution (JER) uncertainties have significant impacts on the measured cross section due to the relatively high p T requirements on the fourth and sixth of the leading jets. In the simulated events, jets are shifted (smeared) according to the p T -and \u03b7-dependent JES (JER) uncertainty, prior to the kinematic fit, and the full event interpretation is repeated. The JES (JER) has a dominant (small) effect on the cross section measurement of 7.0 % (3.5 %). In addition, the JES/JER uncertainties affect the signal template, with a negligible impact (\u22481 %) on the cross section measurement. -b tagging: the performance of the b tagger has a dominant effect on the signal acceptance because the selected events are required to have at least two jets satisfying the CSVM requirement. An event-by-event scale factor (SF btag ) is applied to the simulation, which accounts for the discrepancies between data and simulation in the efficiency of tagging true b jets and in the misidentification rate [46]. The average value of SF btag is 0.99. The uncertainty in the SF btag is taken into account by weighting each event with the shifted value of SF btag which results in a cross section uncertainty of 7.3 %. This is the leading systematic uncertainty. -Integrated luminosity: the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is estimated to be 2.6 % [49]. -Matching partons to showers: the impact of the choice of the scale that separates the description of jet production via matrix elements or parton shower in Mad-Graph is studied by changing its reference value of 20 to 40 and 10 GeV, resulting in an asymmetric effect of \u22124.2, +2.4 % on the cross section. -Renormalization and factorization scales: the uncertainty in modelling of the hard-production process is assessed through changes in the renormalization and factorization scales in the MadGraph sample by factors of two and half, relative to their common nominal value, which is set to the Q of the hard process. In MadGraph, Q is defined by Q 2 = m 2 t + p 2 T , where the sum is over  all additional final state partons in the matrix element calculations. The effect on the measured cross section is moderate and asymmetric (\u22120.5, +3.8 %). -Parton distribution functions: following the PDF4LHC prescription [50,51], the uncertainty on the cross section is estimated to be 1.5 %, taking the largest deviation on the signal acceptance from all the considered PDF eigenvectors. -Non-perturbative QCD: the impact of non-perturbative QCD effects is estimated by studying various tunes of the pythia shower model that predict different underlying event (UE) activity and strength of the color reconnection (CR), namely, the Perugia 2011, Perugia 2011 mpiHi, and Perugia 2011 Tevatron tunes, described in Ref. [52], were used. The effect on the measured cross section is moderate: 4.4 % for the UE and 1.4 % for the CR. -Hadronization model: the effect of the hadronization model on the signal efficiency is estimated by comparing the predictions from the mc@nlo +herwig and powheg +pythia simulations, and it amounts to 2 %.",

The unfolding of the bin-migration effect is performed with the D'Agostini method [53], implemented in the RooUnfold package [54], using the migration matrix derived from the simulation. The uncertainty due to the modeling of the migration matrix and the phase-space extrapolation is estimated by repeating the unfolding and acceptance-correction procedures by varying the systematic sources described in Sect. 6. The numerical values of the normalized differential cross sections at parton level are reported in Table 3. It should be noted that there is a large extrapolation factor involved from the detector-level jets (7E-4 of the signal) to the full parton level, which results in large theoretical uncertainties.",

Then, starting from the six leading jets, the jets associated with B hadrons via matching in \u03b7-\u03c6 ( R < 0.25) are identified as the b jet candidates. Events are further selected if p 4th jet T > 60 GeV and p 6th jet T > 40 GeV and if there are at least two b jets with R bb > 2.0. For the selected events, a \"pseudo top quark\" is reconstructed from one b jet and the two closest non-b-tagged jets. The particle-level results are obtained in a similar way to the parton level, via unfolding and acceptance correction. The numerical values of the normalized differential cross sections at particle level are reported in Table 4.",

Also reported are the fiducial normalized differential cross sections as a function of the leading and subleading top quark p T . Compared to QCD predictions, the measurement shows a significantly softer top quark p T spectrum. The differential cross sections are also extrapolated to the full partonic phase space, as well as to particle level, and can be used to tune Monte Carlo models. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
