The difference leads to an asymmetry in the angular distribution of positively and negatively charged leptons produced in Z boson decays. This asymmetry depends on the weak mixing angle (\u03b8 W ) between the neutral states associated to the U(1) and SU (2) gauge groups, i.e. the relative coupling strengths between the photon and the Z boson. In order to compare directly with previous experimental determinations, a scheme is adopted in which the higher order corrections to the Z boson couplings are absorbed in effective couplings. The resulting effective parameter sin 2 \u03b8 eff W is defined as a function of the ratio of the vector and the axial-vector effective couplings of the Z boson to the fermions involved [1], and is proportional to sin 2 \u03b8 W .",

At the LHC the momentum direction of the initialstate quark is not known, diluting the ability to determine sin 2 \u03b8 eff W from A FB . However, since at LHC the dominant production process is u\u016b, dd \u2192 Z, the main contribution originates from a collision of a valence quark with high momentum and a sea antiquark with lower momentum, and so the Z boson tends to be boosted along the direction of the quark. This is particularly true in the forward region where the Z boson has large longitudinal momentum. Consequently, the sensitivity of A FB to sin 2 \u03b8 eff W is greater at large rapidities of the Z boson. Using simulated samples, it is found that in the LHCb acceptance the assignment of forward and backward decays is correct in 90% of the time.",

Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, that consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. For this analysis, candidates are triggered by at least one muon with momentum larger than 10 GeV. Simulated samples are used to estimate the shapes of the invariant mass distributions for the simulated signal sample and some of the background sources. The signal sample is also used to correct the data for reconstruction and detector effects. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 8 [10,11] with a specific LHCb configuration [12]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [13], in which final-state radiation (FSR) is generated using Photos [14].

The magnetic field scale has been calibrated using dimuon and other resonances at low mass and is known to a precision of 0.04% [9]. Low-mass resonances have also been used as input to the detector alignment, leading to a well-understood momentum calibration for low-momentum tracks [9,23,24]. However, studies for the analysis presented here, have revealed a small, but appreciable, dependence of the position of the Z resonance peak on muon kinematics. This effect can be attributed to residual detector misalignment. The corresponding muon curvature bias can be effectively parameterised in bins of the azimuthal angle of the muon about the beam axis. The - parameters are determined using the difference between the Z mass peak in data and simulation. The procedure is applied separately to data collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, and for the two magnet polarities. The results are consistent with those presented in ref.

            "text": "The following systematic uncertainties are considered when determining A FB . The systematic uncertainty associated with the curvature correction is evaluated by varying these parameters within their uncertainty. The uncertainties on the calibration factors are dependent on the sample size, and are therefore larger for the \u221a s = 7TeV dataset. This is the largest source of systematic uncertainty. An uncertainty of \u00b10.04% is used for the momentum scale, determined from measurements of the magnetic field [9]. The bias in the unfolding procedure is determined from simulation by comparing unfolded samples with the generated true m \u00b5\u00b5 distribution. An additional uncertainty to account for the dependence on the number of iterations used in the training of the unfolding algorithm is determined. This variation has a larger effect in regions where fewer events are simulated. The asymmetry of each background source does not vary significantly over the invariant mass range. An uncertainty of 10% is assigned to the background asymmetry, that covers the fluctuations observed in A FB for each background source. The effect of the uncertainties in the efficiency corrections applied to the data is found to be negligible. The systematic uncertainties are determined separately for each bin of invariant mass and for both datasets. Their average values are summarized in table 1.  The forward-backward asymmetry as a function of the dimuon invariant mass is compared with several sets of SM predictions generated with different values of sin 2 \u03b8 eff W , denoted as A pred FB . The predictions are generated using Powheg-Box with sin 2 \u03b8 eff W values ranging from 0.22 to 0.24 for \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, and the Z boson mass (M Z ) and the electromagnetic coupling constant (\u03b1 EM ) fixed to the world average values [27]. The PDF set from NNPDF [28], 3 with the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.118, was used when generating the A pred FB samples. Theoretical uncertainties associated with the A pred FB distributions are taken into account when determining sin 2 \u03b8 eff W . They arise from the underlying PDF, the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales, the value of \u03b1 s used, and the FSR calculation. Each of these uncertainties, referred to collectively as theoretical uncertainties, are obtained from simulation. The same uncertainty is assigned to A pred FB at both \u221a s = 7 and 8TeV. To estimate the theoretical uncertainty of the PDF set, one hundred replica samples are produced, each with a unique PDF set provided by NNPDF [29]. The value of A pred FB is calculated as a function of m \u00b5\u00b5 for each of these replicas, and the corresponding 68% confidence level interval determined. The size of this uncertainty is larger than the difference observed using CT10 [30] as an alternative PDF parameterisation.  Table 4. Weighted average of the absolute systematic uncertainties for A pred FB , for the different sources of theoretical uncertainty. The value quoted for the PDF uncertainty corresponds to the 68% confidence range, while for the others the maximum and minimum shifts are given. The correlations among the invariant mass bins are not taken into account.",

            "text": "The forward-backward asymmetry for the process qq \u2192 Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 as a function of the dimuon invariant mass is measured with the LHCb detector using proton proton collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 and 8TeV. The measurements are performed in the Collins-Soper frame, using muons with p T > 20 GeV and 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5 with a combined invariant mass 60 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 160 GeV. The forward-backward asymmetry for each invariant mass bin is measured, together with the statistical and experimental  uncertainties. The measurements at each centre-of-mass energy are used to determine a value for sin 2 \u03b8 eff W , by comparing to SM predictions that include FSR. The best fit values obtained are sin 2 \u03b8 eff W = 0.23219 \u00b1 0.00148 and sin 2 \u03b8 eff W = 0.23074 \u00b1 0.00123 for the two samples at \u221a s = 7 and 8TeV respectively. This leads to the combined result sin 2 \u03b8 eff W = 0.23142 \u00b1 0.00073 \u00b1 0.00052 \u00b1 0.00056, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third theoretical. The measurement of sin 2 \u03b8 eff W presented here agrees with previous measurements. The uncertainty from the PDF is the dominant theoretical uncertainty. Further high precision measurements at the LHC are expected to provide additional constraints in the forward region and reduce this uncertainty. As the size of the data sample increases, it will become possible to perform a measurement of A FB double-differentially in dimuon invariant mass and rapidity. Such an approach will allow the analysis to take further advantage of the increased sensitivity of A FB to sin 2 \u03b8 eff W in the most forward region. Open Access.
