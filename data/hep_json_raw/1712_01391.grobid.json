Underground and astrophysical searches look for for dark matter particles in the cosmos, either by interacting directly or by searching for dark matter annihilation. Particle colliders, in contrast, might produce dark matter in the laboratory and are able to probe most basic dark-matter-matter interactions. They are sensitive to low dark matter masses, provide complementary information at higher masses and are subject to different systematic uncertainties. Collider searches are therefore an important part of an inter-disciplinary dark matter search strategy. This article highlights the experimental and phenomenological development in collider dark matter searches of recent years and their connection with the wider field.",

The evidence for DM is strong and consistent across all scales from the galactic to the cosmological [3,4]. DM has not yet been directly observed and it will be one of the most important discoveries in fundamental physics. However, all current evidence for DM is purely of gravitational nature. Why then should we use colliders, in particular hadron colliders where particles are mainly produced via the strong force, to search for DM?",

            "text": "The currently preferred 'WIMP paradigm' predicts that DM consists of very weakly interacting particles (WIMPs) accessible approximately at the electroweak scale, to account for the observed relic density of particles at the freeze out of the thermal equilibrium in the early Universe [5,6,7]. This electroweak scale energy scale is powerfully probed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland [8]. The freeze-out mechanism requires significant couplings between the dark matter and the standard model (SM), which further motivates searches at a particle collider. Furthermore many 'beyond the standard model' (BSM) theories in high energy physics require new particles at the electroweak scale which are either viable DM candidates or might couple to particle DM. The most prominent example of such a theory that connects naturally astrophysical and theoretical motivation is supersymmetry (SUSY). Supersymmetry not only remedies many known problems of the standard model, such as the hierarchy problem, but also provides an excellent DM candidate [9,10,11]. Another motivation is the ability to produce and study DM in the laboratory. Collider production implies production of the mediator, i. e. the force carrier that connects the dark sector with the visible sector of the SM. This allows to study both particles and their interactions in a controlled environment. The primary experimental signature of DM in a collider detector is missing transverse energy, E / T , because the particle responsible for DM will escape the detector undetected. The mediator itself might also have additional decay modes into known SM particles. This would lead to modifications in corresponding observables that even at hadron machines can be detected with high accuracy.",

Table 2.1 lists some of these operators and their coefficients for the most common bilinear covariants of a dirac spinor.

This initial state radiation (ISR) can be used to record the event because of the presence of the high momentum photon or jet. If a pair of DM particles is produced with sufficient momenta, as required by the EFT approach and many models of new physics, then the ISR object and the DM particles will recoil from each other. Along with the missing transverse energy E / T induced by the non-interacting DM this leads to the distinctive E / T +X signature, where X denotes the high momentum SM particle used to trigger the event. The visible and invisible states point in approximately opposite directions of each other. This signature is called 'mono-X'. EFT operators can be calculated for a variety of models. However, there are several constraints on the validity of EFTs that need to be carefully considered. Because EFTs are non-renormalizable field theories they will break down at larger energies and lead to non-physical results, typical when the energy scales probed are of the order of the mass of the integrated out mediator. Some operators also might break the gauge invariance, particularly for mono-W processes [22,23]. EFTs are as well not able to reproduce the details of many interesting processes such as differences in kinematic distributions or resonant particle production [15,24,25,26].",

This undesired behavior is further amplified due to the increasing LHC centreof-mass energies of the past years. Finally, the lack of predictive power of EFT kinematics leads to non-optimal searches.

To do so the mediator particle, the force carrier between the SM and the DM particles, is explicitly taken into account. Only re-normalizable interactions, e.g. dimension 4 or less, are considered [29]. These 'minimal simplified models' [30] are designed to reflect the relevant kinematics and final states. This requires the introduction of a number of new parameters: The couplings to the SM (g q ) and DM sector (g DM ) and the masses of the mediator (m med ) and DM (m DM ). An additional parameter is the width of the mediator \u0393 med which is implicitly taken into account by assuming the minimum decay width of the mediator. This means that the width of the mediator is not a single parameter but is calculated from the other four parameters to allow only decay to the minimal set of particles specified in a given model. This avoids another potential pitfall of using a single value, that is that the total decay width is smaller than the sum of the partial decay widths into dark matter and quarks. Figure 3 shows an example Feynman diagrams of such a simplified model, corresponding to collider production and DM scattering in direct DM searches. The more predictive kinematic and topological distributions of simplified models allow to develop more sophisticated searches and the application of advanced experimental techniques such as machine learning and particle reconstruction algorithms using jet-substructure. Figure 1. The left diagram shows a contributing diagram for mono-jet production with an (axial) vector mediator at a hadron collider. The process is characterised by M med , m DM , g DM and g q , which are the mediator and dark matter masses, and the mediator couplings to dark matter and quarks respectively. The right diagram shows the corresponding scattering process relevant for direct detection, which is characterised by the same four parameters.",

In the non-relativistic limit the vector interaction gives a spin-independent interaction that is coherently enhanced by the number of nucleons, while the axial-vector interaction gives a spin-dependent signal which is not. In principle, it is also possible to have mixed vector and axial-vector couplings (so that e.g. the quarks have vector couplings while the dark matter has axial-vector couplings). However, the mixed interaction leads to a velocity-squared (where v DM ' 10 3 ) suppressed rate at direct detection experiments [57].

In our MSDM models, we calculate the width from the four free parameters in the simplified model. We assume that no additional visible or invisible decays contribute to med so that the total width is 2.2.1. s-channel models The majority of simplified models presently analysed are s-channel production processes as displayed in Fig. 3. The mediator between SM and DM particles is usually assumed to be a boson, describing a vector or axial-vector interaction in case of spin 1 and correspondingly a scalar-or pseudo-scalar interaction if spin 0. For spin 1 mediators the couplings to all quarks are assumed to be equal and for scalar mediators proportional to the Yukawa coupling and therefore to the fermion mass [31] to comply with minimal flavour violation [31]. Hence these couple most strongly to third generation top and bottom quarks. This mass dependency might help to distinguishing the type of coupling after discovery [32,33,34,35]. Typical values of the couplings to quarks chosen are g q = 1.0 (0.25) for spin-0 (spin-1) particles, respectively, as recommended by the 'LHC Dark Matter Working Group' (DMWG) [31]. The vertex between DM particle and mediator is always taken to be g DM = 1.0. As further detailed in Ref. [28] g q should be thought of as a numerical factor such as a mixing angle rather than an independent coupling. The DMWG provides a set of recommendations of models, couplings and parameter space to facilitate comparison between experimental dark matter searches [31].",

These couplings can be universal in terms of colour and generations, but might violate universality with preferred couplings to the first two generations [36,37,38,39,40,41]. Another possibility is that the DM carries the flavour index (flavoured dark matter) [38,42,43,44], and the strongest couplings might occur to third generation particles (top-flavoured dark matter). Models in this case are reminiscent of 'squarks phenomenology' in minimal supersymmetric models and lead to similar collider signatures. A multitude of other very interesting production modes might occur such as pair production of the mediator, spin-2 mediators, scalar DM particles and more. Mediator pair production for example might lead to sensitivities to such signals in dijet searches. To describe them would exceed the scope of this review and we refer the interested reader to the literature, see for example Ref. [45,46,47,48,49,49,50,51]. Final state with dilepton resonances are also possible but lead usually to weaker constraints [52,53,54].",

The mediator itself might also decay into SM particles, most likely quarks and gluons [62,63,64] that then can be observed as a narrow resonance in the invariant mass of the dijet spectrum. Dijet resonance searches have been carried out in many experiments, i.e. UA1, UA2, CDF, D0, CMS and ATLAS [45,46,47,48,49,49,50,51]. Final state with dilepton resonances are also possible but lead usually to weaker constraints [52,53,54].",

The LHC provides most powerful high mass constraints but allows to constrain lower masses also if the dijet resonance is produced in association with other heavy particles, e.g. the W or Z boson. At low masses results from the Tevatron and UA2 still provide strong limits, but generally the couplings tested are rather large at the order of one [65].

Searches for light mediators at low energy e + e \u2212 collider, B-factories and beam dump experiments Very light, sub-GeV scale gauge boson are well motivated by the about 3.5\u03c3 discrepancy between prediction and observation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [66]. Light mediators might also explain the observed relic densities and small-scale structure problems in cosmology [67,68]. Because of the large background rates at the LHC, the ATLAS and CMS detectors are generally not sensitive to this mass range with the exception of searches using B mesons. However beam dump experiments and low energy collider can access this phase space. Additionally rare decays of \u03a5 and B meson searches can be used to set constraints on light scalar (Higgs-like) mediators that is constructed to be in the same multiplet with the DM particle [69] Experiments at low energy lepton colliders such as BaBar [70] and Belle [71] provide unique sensitivity to very low DM masses and light mediators of 10 GeV in a clean experimental environment. The simplified models used replace the coupling of the mediator to quarks g q with a corresponding coupling to electrons, g e . The simplest such model is that the DM couples to the SM via a 'dark photon' A [72,73]. The dark photon is massive mediator from a broken gauge symmetry U (1) in the dark sector and couples through kinetic mixing with a photon to the electric charge. In these models is used as parameter instead of g e because of g e = eq i . Scalar and vector type couplings, validity constraints and width are considered as before. The sensitivity for (pseudo-)scalar couplings is small at low energy colliders because of the smallness of the electron Yukawa-couplings [74]. While low energy colliders can probe a largely unexplored parameter space only few searches have been performed so far, often with just a fraction of the available data set because of the absence of a dedicated mono-photon trigger. Soon to start high-intensity experiments such as Belle-II [75] will be able to powerfully probe this region.",

Correspondingly, only an inter-disciplinary combination of several DM detectors is able to measure the properties of dark matter precisely. Therefore it is necessary that the models and methods used at the LHC are transferable to the other DM detection areas, although this is not always trivial [101,102]. The most important parameters are predictions of the scattering and annihilation cross sections relevant do direct and indirect detection experiments. If the same model can be utilised to compare different search strategies, then even the absence of a signal in one detection method allows to constrain the permitted parameter space and to optimise searches in the other areas.",

Table 2 gives an overview of the individual strengths of the three detection approaches: direct, indirect and collider dark matter searches. While colliders might access DM via all four basic interactions -axial, axial-vector, scalar, and pseudoscalar -the kinematic reach is limited by the centre-of-mass energy. Direct and indirect searches extend the sensitivity to higher masses of particle dark matter but are not equally sensitive to different couplings.

In the first case, if the mass of the dark matter is small compared to mediator, then the WIMP pair is boosted opposite to the direction of the visible particle(s), leading to the 'mono-X' signature, \u2206\u03c6(E / T , X) \u2248 \u03c0. Here X can be a multitude of particles such as \u03b3, g, q, W, Z, H and others. Today's searches extend to larger particle multiplicities and hence 'mono-X' has become technically a misnomer but is still widely used to refer to collider dark matter searches. For DM heavier than the mediator, the mediator becomes off-shell, resulting in weaker constraints from colliders due to kinematically suppressed production cross sections [109].",

The first search using photons at a hadron collider was performed at the Tevatron pp collider by the CDF collaboration at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [121]. D\u00d8 performed the very first mono-jet analysis also in the search for large extra dimension [122]. By the early 2010s using LHC data at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV the potential of this signature for DM searches has been fully recognised and different final states analysed, extending experimental signatures to larger jet-multiplicities and more complex final states involving heavy quarks, gauge, and Higgs bosons. These early dark matter searches at the Tevatron and LHC were true mono-X searches in the sense that those employed final states with exactly one reconstructed high momentum jet or photon that is required to be approximately back to back to the E / T . Dominant background sources are Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) production and W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets production where the lepton fails reconstruction. These searches were updated with increasing centre of mass energies and datasets, the energy increase of the LHC from 7 to 8 TeV led to about one order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity on the traditional WIMP-nucleon-cross-section. The development of simplified models that provide more predictive kinematics [109], the danger to misinterpret EFTs perturbative bounds and the fact that even in EFTs the majority of events contain more than one high-p T jet [123] lead to the inclusion of higher jet multiplicities and new final states towards the end of the 8 TeV run.",

Backgrounds are dominated by Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) + jets and W + jets processes and are estimated separately for mono-j and mono-V channels in a number of dedicated data control regions. Limits on mono-j and mono-V production are derived based on the E / T distribution that lead to the currently strongest constraints on DM from collider searches. Corresponding E / T distributions from ATLAS and CMS are presented in Fig. 10. Another possible DM discovery channel is the decay of the Higgs boson to DM particles. The result of the mono-j/V search is then interpreted in terms of upper limits on the decay of the Higgs boson to invisible particles, H \u2192 inv. Mono-j/V searches constrain the H \u2192 inv branching fraction to about 50% of the total decay width of the Higgs boson, see Fig. 11. While dedicated measurements set more stringent constraints of about 25%, mono-jet analyses contribute to the combination of H \u2192 inv because they are based on an independent data sample. Throughout the 13 TeV LHC run the mono-j/V search provides the strongest constraints on simplified dark matter models. [136,128]  ",

The background processes are estimated using signal depleted control regions in data and MC simulations. Because the missing transverse momentum provides less discrimination power in heavy quark searches, distributions such as the opening angle between the b-quarks, or the angle between E / T and b-quarks are used [138]. The CMS collaboration also uses a kinematic fit to the top quark and W bosons masses to reconstruct jet momenta, energy, and resolutions. This 'top tagger' improves purity of the selected events and sensitivity for DM plus top quark models [141]. Searches for colourless spin-0 particles are just reaching sensitivity based on DMWG recommendations [31]. Figure 13 shows an example in which the limits derived from collider measurements are compared to astrophysical indirect measurements. For a DM particle of approximately 35 GeV, as suggested by the interpretation of data recorded by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration [143,144], mediator masses below 1.1 TeV are excluded at 95% CL by the b-FDM, a model containing a colour-charged scalar mediator model decaying into a bottom quark and a DM particle [42].",

Depending on the new particle's branching fractions, the dijet channel might be the most viable and straightforward way to discover new physics. Interpreting the new particles as the spin-1 mediator of simplified models, the dijet searches place tight constrains on the mediator mass in DM searches [158,159,160]. In order to still obtain significant mono-X production, the coupling of the mediator to quarks has to be considerably smaller than the coupling to dark matter. Because of the large QCD background at low masses, high p T jets are needed to maintain manageable trigger rates in proton collision. Hence these searches are typically sensitive to mediator masses of O(100 \u2212 1000) GeV. The low mass reach can be extended by taking into account the angular distribution of the jets or requiring associated production with heavy gauge boson [159,161]  Figure 15. The 95% CL observed (solid) and expected (dashed) excluded regions in the plane of dark matter mass vs. mediator mass, for a vector mediator, compared to constraints from the cosmological relic density of DM (light gray) determined from astrophysical measurements [162,163].

In most R-parity conserving SUSY theories the lightest stable supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the DM candidate [167]. In many minimal supersymmetric models (MSSM) the LSP is the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 ), a physical superposition of the superpartners to the weak hypercharge, the W s and the Higgs (Bino, neutral Wino and Higgsinos) [168]. There are other viable SUSY candidates, for example the right-handed sneutrino [169]. A comprehensive review of the SUSY model space and analyses is not possible within the scope of this review and we refer to the literature [168,4,170,171,172].",

            "text": "Low energy and beam dump experiments have unique sensitivities to well motived low mass mediators. Low energy e + e \u2212 data from BaBar has been re-analysed under the light of DM searches. Only about 55 fb \u22121 of the 500 fb \u22121 dataset of BaBar is recorded with a mono-photon trigger. The Belle [71] and KLOE [185] experiments didn't employ a mono-photon trigger and hence no re-analysis is possible. As shown in Fig. 20 the analysis of BaBar data probes new parameter space and orders of magnitude improvements will be possible at at Belle-II which is soon to start [74]. The MiniBoone [78] collaboration is performing a fixed target experiment searching for DM. Employing 8 GeV protons from Fermilab's neutrino beam in 'offtarget' mode to reduce neutrino-induced background they search for DM induced event downstream of the target. After accounting for various background the analysis improves upon the BaBar results [78]. For vector portal DM model this analysis sets the currently most stringent constraints on low mass DM of less than 0.3 GeV, see   Figure 19. Limits on the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section in Higgs-portal models assuming a scalar or fermion DM particle. The dashed lines show the variation in the exclusion limit using alternative coupling values as described in [58]. The limits are given at the 90% CL to allow for comparison to direct detection constraints from the LUX [178], PandaX-II [183], and CDMSlite [184] experiments.",

Collider searches are particularly powerful at low WIMP masses, about the mass of a carbon atom or less, but they also explore larger masses and are not subject to significant astrophysical uncertainties. Direct and indirect searches obtain the best sensitivities at intermediate and large masses but are more dependent on the structure of the interaction (e.g. spin-dependent or independent), astrophysical uncertainties and detector technology. Collider DM searches are therefore a crucial component in the multi-pronged strategy to search for DM and are uniquely able to measure various DM properties in case of a discovery. Each of the three DM detection methods probe different parts of the parameter space with complementary strengths. All three are required to access the full phase space of particle dark matter and eventually measure its properties.",

However, a variety of DM models have been ruled out and new inter-disciplinary developments that will be needed to measure the DM properties instigated.",

Only about 5% of expected LHC data have been recorded and less than 2% analysed. Furthermore, the vast majority of searches are exploring a similar E / T + X phase space recorded using similar trigger.

To cover the maximal phase space all three approaches are required.3. Experimental Environment3.1. The Large Hadron ColliderThe LHC is the world's highest-energy particle accelerator. The LHC already accomplished successful data taking periods at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV in 2011, 2012 respectively. The current run, Run 2, started in summer 2015 with an unprecedented centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV and nearly three times larger instantaneous luminosity in comparison to the previous runs. The detectors have been upgraded to maintain and improve data taking under these challenging conditions. Rapid accumulation of data is taking place during Run 2 until late 2018. This allows to extend sensitivities to dark matter into yet unexplored regimes with an expected integrated luminosity of about 150 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The entire Run 2 data set will be at least six times larger at almost twice the energy compared to previous data taking periods. Following Run 2, a 18 month shutdown is foreseen to prepare the machine and detectors for even larger luminosities. This will allow the CMS and ATLAS experiments to record a planned 300 fb \u22121 by the year 2022 in what is called Run 3. Following another two year shutdown the 'High Luminosity LHC' (HL-LHC) is the final stage of the LHC. The HL-LHC will deliver up to 3000 fb \u22121",
