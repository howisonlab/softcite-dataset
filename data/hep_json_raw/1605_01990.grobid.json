For each combination of hadronic and 263 primary model, fluxes calculated in various atmospheric 264 density profiles are used to derive the F(\u03b4) parameteri-265 zation. 266 Neutrino propagation and interaction uncertainties 267 Two sets of neutrino propagation uncertainties are 268 treated in the search. Neutrino oscillation and absorption 269 effects both depend on the Earth density profile along 270 the neutrino trajectory, which is parameterized by the 271 PREM model [53]. Uncertainties in the Earth compo-272 sition and density are accounted for by creating pertur-273 bations of the PREM and re-propagating the neutrino 274 flux. The PREM variants are constructed under the con-275 straints that the Earth mass and moment of inertia are 276 preserved, that the density gradient is always negative in 277 the core and mantle regions, and that the local perturba-278 tion is never more than 10%. The effects of Earth model 279 uncertainty on the final propagated neutrino spectrum 280 are incorporated by minimizing over 9 discrete perturbed 281 models. 282 A further propagation uncertainty is the neutrino 283 charged-current cross-section which, at these energies, is 284 dominated by deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The uncer-285 tainty in the cross-sections arises from parton distribu-286 tion function (PDF) uncertainties. A parametrization of 287 the cross-section uncertainty uses calculations [54] (see 288 also [55]) based on three different PDF sets: HERAPDF 289 [56], CT10 [57] and NNPDF [58]. In each case, sim-290 ulated neutrino interactions are re-weighted using true 291 neutrino energy and inelasticity given calculated doubly-292 differential cross sections, and the analysis fit is run using 293 the weighted sample.",

The muon zenith angle can be reconstructed geometrically with a resolution of \u03c3 cos(\u03b8z) varying between 0.005 and 0.015 depending on the angle. Due to energy sharing in production and radiative losses outside the detector, the detected muon energy is smeared downward from the original neutrino value.
