The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The Z boson candidates are identified through their decays into pairs of electrons or muons. Jets originating from heavy flavour quarks are identified using semileptonic decays of c or b flavoured hadrons and hadronic decays of charm hadrons. The measurements are performed in the kinematic region with two leptons with p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7 | < 2.1, 71 < m < 111 GeV, and heavy flavour jets with p jet T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | < 2.5. The Z + c production cross section is measured to be \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z + c + X )B(Z \u2192 + \u2212 ) = 8.8\u00b10.5 (stat)\u00b10.6 (syst) pb. The ratio of the Z+c and Z+b production cross sections is measured to be \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z+c+ X )/\u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z+b+ X ) = 2.0\u00b10.2 (stat)\u00b10.2 (syst). The Z +c production cross section and the cross section ratio are also measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z boson and of the heavy flavour jet. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions.",

A e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch proper characterization of these processes and validation of their theoretical description is important to provide a reliable estimate of their specific backgrounds to the various searches. For example, third-generation scalar quarks (squarks) that are predicted by supersymmetric theories to decay via charm quarks have been searched for in final states with a charm quark jet (c jet) and a large transverse momentum imbalance [1][2][3]. A dominant background to this process is the associated production of a c jet and a Z boson that decays invisibly into neutrinos. An improved description of this background can be obtained from a measurement of the same process with the Z boson decaying into charged leptons.",

More recently, the LHCb Collaboration has measured the associated production of a Z boson and a D meson in the forward region in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [16]. In this paper we present a measurement of the production cross section at \u221a s = 8 TeV of a Z boson and at least one jet from a c quark. In addition, the relative production of a Z boson and a jet from heavy quarks of different flavours (c or b) is quantified by the ratio of their production cross sections. The associated production of a Z boson and at least one or two b jets using an inclusive b tagging technique to identify Z + b events has been studied with the same dataset and the results are reported in Ref. [17]. To reduce the uncertainties in the ratio, the production cross section of a Z boson and a jet from a b quark is remeasured in this analysis using exactly the same methodology as for the Z + c cross section. The remeasured Z + b cross section agrees with the published value within one standard deviation and is used in the ratio measurement.",

            "text": "The Z boson is identified through its decay into a pair of electrons or muons. Jets with HF quark content are identified through (1) the semileptonic decay of c or b flavoured hadrons with a muon in the final state, and (2) using exclusive hadronic decays of charm hadrons. The cross section and cross section ratio are measured at the level of stable particles, which are defined prior to the emission of any electroweak radiation. To minimize acceptance corrections, the measurements are restricted to a phase space that is close to the experimental fiducial volume with optimized sensitivity for the investigated processes: two leptons with transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV, pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | < 2.1, and dilepton invariant mass consistent with the mass of the Z boson, 71 < m < 111 GeV, together with a c (b) jet with p jet T > 25 GeV, |\u03b7 jet | < 2.5. The jet should be separated from the leptons of the Z boson candidate by a distance \u0394R(jet, ) = \u221a (\u0394\u03b7) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6) 2 > 0.5. The cross section \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z+c+X )B(Z \u2192 + \u2212 ) (abbreviated as \u03c3 (Z+c) B) and the cross section ratio \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z + c + X )/\u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z+b+X ) (abbreviated as \u03c3 (Z+c)/\u03c3 (Z+b)) are determined both inclusively and differentially as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z boson, p Z T , and the p T of the jet with heavy flavour content, p jet T . The paper is structured as follows. The CMS detector is briefly described in Sect. 2, and the data and simulated samples used are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 deals with the selection of the Z + HF jets signal sample, the auxiliary samples of events from the associated production of W+c, and top quark-antiquark (tt) production. The determination of the c tagging efficiency is the subject of Sect. 5. The analysis strategy devised to separate the two contributions, Z + c and Z + b, in the sample of Z + HF jets is detailed in Sect. 6. Section 7 reviews the most important sources of systematic uncertainties and their impact on the measurements. Finally, the measurements of the inclusive Z + c cross section and the (Z + c)/(Z + b) cross section ratio are presented in Sect. 8, and the differential measurements are reported in Sect. 9. The main results of the paper are summarized in Sect. 10.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules. For nonisolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90  \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [18]. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [19]. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [20]. For nonisolated muons with 1 < p T < 25 GeV, the relative transverse momentum resolution is 1.2-1.7% in the barrel and 2.5-4.0% in the endcaps [18]. The first level of the CMS trigger system [21], composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events of interest in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the basic kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [22].",

A sample of signal Z boson events is generated with MadGraph v5.1.3.30 [23], interfaced with pythia v6.4.26 [24] for parton showering and hadroniza-tion using the MLM [25,26] matching scheme. The Mad-Graph generator produces parton-level events with a vector boson and up to four partons at leading order (LO) on the basis of a matrix-element calculation. The generation uses the parton distribution functions (PDF) set CTEQ6L [27]. The matching scale between jets from matrix element calculations and those produced via parton showers is 10 GeV, and the factorization and renormalization scales are set to 2 . Other physics processes produce events with the same final state topology as the signal. The main background is the production of tt events. Smaller contributions are expected from the direct production of a pair of vector bosons: WW, WZ, and ZZ.",

The factor one-half accounts for the expected ratio of charged to neutral particle energy in hadronic interactions.

The corrected secondary-vertex mass tends to be larger for Z + b than for Z + c events because the larger mass of the b quark gives rise to heavier hadrons (m b hadrons \u2248 5 GeV, m c hadrons \u2248 2 GeV).",

Corrections are made for acceptance losses at the border of the kinematical region because of the detector resolution and reconstruction inefficiencies. The unfolding is performed with an analytical inversion of the matrix defining the event migrations. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are propagated through the unfolding procedure. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the fitted Z + c and Z + b signal yields, the Z + c cross section, and the (Z + c)/(Z + b) cross section ratio in the three p Z T and p jet T bins and in the two Z boson decay channels. The differential cross section and cross section ratio measured in the two Z boson decay channels are consistent and are combined to obtain the final results, taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the two channels and the correlations among them. The combined cross section and cross section ratio are presented in Table 4. They are also shown graphically in Fig. 11 in bins of p Z T (top) and p jet T (bottom). Theoretical predictions for the differential cross section and cross section ratio are also obtained with the two MC generator programs and with mcfm. They are shown in Fig. 11 for comparison with the measured values. The uncertainties in the MadGraph predictions include the statistical and PDF uncertainties. Scale variations are additionally included in the uncertainties of MG5_aMC and mcfm. Predictions from MG5_aMC are higher than the predictions from Mad-Graph in the three bins of the Z+c differential distributions. A higher (Z + c)/(Z + b) cross section ratio is predicted up to 60 GeV, although consistent within uncertainties. The predictions from MadGraph and MG5_aMC successfully reproduce the measurements. The level of agreement is similar in terms of the Z+c cross section and the (Z + c)/(Z + b) cross section ratio.",
