The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The measurement is performed in the dilepton e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 final state. The tt cross section is determined as a function of various pairs of observables characterizing the kinematics of the top quark and tt system. The data are compared to calculations using perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading and approximate nextto-next-to-leading orders. They are also compared to predictions of Monte Carlo event generators that complement fixed-order computations with parton showers, hadronization, and multiple-parton interactions. Overall agreement is observed with the predictions, which is improved when the latest global sets of proton parton distribution functions are used. The inclusion of the measured tt cross sections in a fit of parametrized parton distribution functions is shown to have significant impact on the gluon distribution.",

A large sample of proton-proton (pp) collision events containing a top quark pair (tt) has been recorded at the CERN LHC, facilitating precise top quark measurements. In particular, precise measurements of the tt production cross section as a function of tt kinematic observables have become possible, which allow for the validation of the most-recent predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). At the LHC, top quarks are predominantly produced via gluon-gluon fusion. Thus, using measurements of the production cross section in a global fit of the parton e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch distribution functions (PDFs) can help to better determine the gluon distribution at large values of x, where x is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by a parton [3][4][5]. In this context, tt measurements are complementary to studies [6][7][8] that exploit inclusive jet production cross sections at the LHC.",

This paper presents the measurement of the normalized double-differential tt + X production cross section, where X is inclusive in the number of extra jets in the event but excludes tt+Z/W/\u03b3 production. The cross section is measured as a function of observables describing the kinematics of the top quark and tt: the transverse momentum of the top quark, p T (t), the rapidity of the top quark, y(t), the transverse momentum, p T (tt), the rapidity, y(tt), and the invariant mass, M(tt), of tt, the pseudorapidity between the top quark and antiquark, \u0394\u03b7(t, t), and the angle between the top quark and antiquark in the transverse plane, \u0394\u03c6(t, t). In total, the double-differential tt cross section is measured as a function of six different pairs of kinematic variables.",

Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap sections up to |\u03b7| < 5.2. Charged particle trajectories are measured by the inner tracking system, covering a range of |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL and HCAL surround the tracking volume, providing high-resolution energy and direction measurements of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets up to |\u03b7| < 3. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid covering the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. The detector is nearly her-metic, allowing momentum balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam directions.

An event is required to contain at least two oppositely charged leptons, one electron and one muon, each with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Only the electron and the muon with the highest p T are considered for the analysis. The invariant mass of the selected electron and muon must be larger than 20 GeV to suppress events from decays of heavy-flavour resonances. The leptons are required to be isolated with I rel \u2264 0.15 inside a cone in \u03b7\u03c6 space of \u0394R = (\u0394\u03b7) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6) 2 = 0.3 around the lepton track, where \u0394\u03b7 and \u0394\u03c6 are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle (in radians), respectively, between the directions of the lepton and any other particle. The parameter I rel is the relative isolation parameter defined as the sum of transverse energy deposits inside the cone from charged and neutral hadrons, and photons, relative to the lepton p T , corrected for pileup effects. The efficiencies of the lepton isolation were determined in Z boson data samples using the \"tag-and-probe\" method of Ref. [39], and are found to be well described by the simulation for both electrons and muons. The overall difference between data and simulation is estimated to be <2% for electrons, and <1% for muons.

A jet is selected if it has p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks (b jets) are identified using an algorithm [42] that provides a b tagging discriminant by combining secondary vertices and track-based lifetime information.

Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . To mitigate the pileup effects on the p miss T resolution, a multivariate correction is used where the measured momentum is separated into components that originate from the primary and from other interaction vertices [44]. No selection requirement on p miss T is applied. The tt kinematic properties are determined from the four-momenta of the decay products using the same kinematic reconstruction method [45,46] as that of the singledifferential tt measurement [15]. The six unknown quantities are the three-momenta of the two neutrinos, which are reconstructed by imposing the following six kinematic constraints: p T conservation in the event and the masses of the W bosons, top quark, and top antiquark. The top quark and antiquark are required to have a mass of 172.5 GeV. It is assumed that the p miss T in the event results from the two neutrinos in the top quark and antiquark decay chains. To resolve the ambiguity due to multiple algebraic solutions of the equations for the neutrino momenta, the solution with the smallest invariant mass of the tt system is taken. The reconstruction is performed 100 times, each time randomly smearing the measured energies and directions of the reconstructed leptons and jets within their resolution. This smearing recovers events that yielded no solution because of measurement fluctuations. The three-momenta of the two neutrinos are determined as a weighted average over all the smeared solutions. For each solution, the weight is calculated based on the expected invariant mass spectrum of a lepton and a bottom jet as the product of two weights for the top quark and antiquark decay chains. All possible lepton-jet combinations in the event are considered. Combinations are ranked based on the presence of b-tagged jets in the assignments, i.e. a combination with both leptons assigned to b-tagged jets is preferred over those with one or no btagged jet. Among assignments with equal number of btagged jets, the one with the highest average weight is chosen. Events with no solution after smearing are discarded. The method yields an average reconstruction efficiency of \u224895%, which is determined in simulation as the fraction of selected signal events (which include only direct tt decays via the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 channel, i.e. excluding cascade decays via \u03c4 leptons) passing the kinematic reconstruction. The overall difference in this efficiency between data and simulation is estimated to be \u22481%, and a corresponding correction factor is applied to the simulation [47]. A more detailed description of the kinematic reconstruction procedure can be found in Ref. [47].",

[15]. For each change made, the cross section determination is repeated, and the difference with respect to the nominal result in each bin is taken as the systematic uncertainty. To account for the pileup uncertainty, the value of the total pp inelastic cross section, which is used to estimate the mean number of additional pp interactions, is varied by \u00b15% [52]. The data-to-simulation correction factors for b tagging and mistagging efficiencies are varied within their uncertainties [42] as a function of the p T and |\u03b7| of the jet, following the procedure described in Ref.

The systematic uncertainty related to the kinematic reconstruction of top quarks is assessed by varying the MC correction factor by its estimated uncertainty of \u00b11% [47]. For the uncertainties related to the jet energy scale, the jet energy is varied in the simulation within its uncertainty [53]. The uncertainty owing to the limited knowledge of the jet energy resolution is determined by changing the latter in the simulation by \u00b11 standard deviation in different \u03b7 regions [54].

The results are listed in Tables 2 and 3 for the NLO and approximate NNLO calculations, respectively. For the NLO predictions, additional \u03c7 2 values are reported including the corresponding PDF uncertainties, i.e. Eq. 5becomes Cov = Cov unf + Cov syst + Cov PDF , where Cov PDF is a covariance matrix that accounts for the PDF uncertainties. Theoretical uncertainties from scale variations are not included in this \u03c7 2 calculation. The NLO predictions with recent global PDFs using LHC data, namely MMHT2014, CT14, and NNPDF3.0, are found to describe the p T (t), y(t), and y(tt) cross sections reasonably, as illustrated by the \u03c7 2 values. The CJ15 PDF set also provides a good description of these cross sections, although it does not include LHC data [61]. The ABM11, JR14, and HERAPDF2.0 sets yield a poorer description of the data. Large differences between the data and the nominal NLO calculations are observed for the \u0394\u03b7(t, t), p T (tt), and \u0394\u03c6(t, t) cross sections. It is noteworthy that the scale uncertainties in the predictions, which are of comparable size or exceed the experimental uncertainties, are not taken into account in the \u03c7 2 calculations. The p T (tt) and \u0394\u03c6(t, t) normalized cross sections are represented at LO O(\u03b1 2 s ) by delta functions, and nontrivial shapes appear at O(\u03b1 3 s ), thus resulting in large NLO scale uncertainties [18].

To further illustrate the sensitivity to PDFs, the nominal values of the NLO predictions using HERAPDF2.0 are shown as well. Similar comparisons, in  for the NLO predictions using CT14, while the dark band includes also the PDF uncertainties added in quadrature (\u03bc + PDF). The dotted line shows the NLO predictions calculated with HERAPDF2.0. The dashed line shows the approximate NNLO predictions calculated with CT14. In the bottom panel, the ratios of the data and other calculations to the NLO prediction using CT14 are shown   and 13. Considering the scale uncertainties in the predictions, the agreement between the measurement and predictions is reasonable for all distributions. For the p T (t), y(t), and y(tt) cross sections, the scale uncertainties in the predictions reach 4% at maximum. They increase to 8% for the \u0394\u03b7(t, t) cross section, and vary within 20-50% for the p T (tt) and \u0394\u03c6(t, t) cross sections, where larger differences between data and predictions are observed. For the p T (t), y(t), and y(tt) cross sections, the PDF uncertainties as estimated from the CT14 PDF set are of the same size or larger than the scale uncer-tainties. The HERAPDF2.0 predictions are mostly outside the total CT14 uncertainty band, showing also some visible shape differences with respect to CT14. The approximate NNLO predictions provide an improved description of the p T (t) shape.",

The Thorne-Roberts [82][83][84] variable-flavour number scheme at NLO is used for the treatment of the heavy-quark contributions. The number of flavours is set to 5, with c and b quark mass parameters M c = 1.47 GeV and M b = 4.5 GeV [63]. The theoretical predictions for the W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry data are calculated at NLO [85] using the mcfm program, which is interfaced with ApplGrid (version 1.4.70) [86], as described in Ref. [72]. For the DIS and W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry data \u03bc r and \u03bc f are set to Q, which denotes the four-momentum transfer in the case of the DIS data, and the mass of the W \u00b1 boson in the case of the W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry. The theoretical predictions for the tt cross sections are calculated as described in Sect. 8.2 and included in the fit using the mcfm and ApplGrid programs. The strong coupling strength is set to \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.118. The Q 2 range of the HERA data is restricted to Q 2 > Q 2 min = 3.5 GeV 2 [63].

This value is consistent with the determination of the strangeness fraction when using the CMS measurements of W + c production [88]. The parameters in Eq.

The improvement in the \u03c7 2 of the fit is monitored and the procedure is stopped when no further improvement is observed. This leads to an 18-parameter fit.

The parametrization uncertainty is estimated by extending the functional form in Eq. 7of all parton distributions with additional parameters D, E, and F added one at a time. Furthermore, \u03bc 2 f0 is changed to 1.6 and 2.2 GeV 2 . The parametrization uncertainty is constructed as an envelope at each x value, built from the maximal differences between the PDFs resulting from the central fit and all parametrization variations. This uncertainty is valid in the x range covered by the PDF fit to the data. The total PDF uncertainty is obtained by adding the fit, model, and parametrization uncertainties in quadrature. In the following, the quoted uncertainties correspond to 68% CL.",

The DIS data show \u03c7 2 /dof values slightly larger than unity. This is similar to what is observed and investigated in Ref. [63].  Fit results consistent with those from Ref. [72] are obtained using the W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry measurements. The resulting gluon, valence quark, and sea quark distributions are shown in Fig. 14 at the scale \u03bc 2 f = 30, 000 GeV 2 m 2 t relevant for tt production. For a direct comparison, the distributions for all variants of the fit are normalized to the results from the fit using only the DIS and W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry data. The reduction of the uncertainties is further illustrated in Fig. 15. The uncertainties in the gluon distribution at x > 0.01 are significantly reduced once the tt data are included in the fit. The largest improvement comes from the [y(tt), M(tt)] cross section by which the total gluon PDF uncertainty is reduced by more than a factor of two at x 0.3. This value of x is at the edge of kinematic reach of the current tt measurement. At higher values x 0.3, the gluon distribution is not directly constrained by the data and should be considered as an extrapolation that relies on the PDF parametrization assumptions. No substantial effects on the valence quark and sea quark distributions are observed. The variation of \u03bc r and \u03bc f in the prediction of the normal-ized tt cross sections has been performed and the effect on the fitted PDFs is found to be well within the total uncertainty.",

The measurement is performed in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 final state, using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The normalized tt cross section is measured in the full phase space as a function of different pairs of kinematic variables describing the top quark or tt system. None of the tested MC models is able to correctly describe all the double-differential distributions. The data exhibit a softer transverse momentum p T (t) distribution, compared to the Monte Carlo predictions, as was reported in previous single-differential tt cross section measurements. The double-differential studies reveal a broader distribution of rapidity y(t) at high tt invariant mass M(tt) and a larger pseudorapidity separation \u0394\u03b7(t, t) at moderate M(tt) in data compared to simulation. The data are in reasonable agreement with next-to-leading-order predictions of quantum chromodynamics using recent sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs).",

In the NNLO fit, the scales for tt production are set to \u03bc r = \u03bc f = m t , with m t = 173 GeV being the top quark pole mass. The scale evolution of partons is calculated through the DGLAP equations at NNLO. The DIS and W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry theoretical predictions are calculated at NNLO accuracy. For the W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry predictions, the NNLO corrections are obtained by using K-factors, defined as the ratios of the predictions at NNLO to the ones at NLO, both calculated with the fewz [91] program (version 3.1), using the NNLO CT10 [32] PDFs. As in Ref. [63], the charm quark mass parameter is set to M c = 1.43 GeV for a fit at NNLO. To stabilise for the comparison, the fit of the gluon distribution at NNLO, which suffers from insufficient constraints when using the inclusive HERA DIS and W \u00b1 boson charge asymmetry data alone, the Q 2 range of the HERA data is further restricted to Q 2 > Q 2 min = 7.5 GeV 2 .
