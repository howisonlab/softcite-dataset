They have been essential in tuning the parton shower and non-perturbative components of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators and have provided a laboratory for developing and testing analytical probes of the hadronization process. More recently, a large set of event-shape variables suitable for pp colliders has been proposed [3,4]. An important aspect of these variables is their normalization to the measured sum of transverse momentum or energy of all the objects in the event. It is thus expected that energy-scale uncertainties should cancel to a large extent. Event-shape variables represent a valuable tool for early measurements of the properties of QCD multijet events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the tuning of MC models [5].",

Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke.

In the (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystal arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with lead is located in front of the ECAL at |\u03b7| > 1.479. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry covering the region 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. Two event-shape variables have been studied: the central transverse thrust \u03c4 \u22a5,C and the central thrust minor T m,C . The two variables probe different QCD radiative processes and are mostly sensitive to the modeling of two-and three-jet topologies.

The second generator is pythia 8.145 (pythia8) [13] with tune 2C [14]. In this version of pythia, parton showers are ordered by p T . The underlying event model is based on the multiple-parton interaction model of pythia6, interleaved with initial-and final-state radiation. The third generator is herwig++ 2.4.2 [15] used with the tune of older version 2.3. The parton showering in herwig++ is based on the coherent-branching algorithm, with angular ordering of the showers. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The fourth is MadGraph 4.4.24 [16] in conjunction with pythia6, with tune D6T. Events containing from two to four jets matched to partons with p T above 20 GeV/c are produced with MadGraph using a matrix element (ME) calculation and subsequently passed to pythia to generate parton showers (PS). The MLM matching procedure [17] is used to avoid double counting between the ME and PS calculations. For the matching, the minimum jet p T threshold is set to 30 GeV/c. Finally, the alpgen 2.13 [18] generator is used in a similar way to MadGraph. alpgen samples are produced separately for each jet multiplicity from two to six jets, matched to partons with p T above 20 GeV/c, and are weighted according to their theoretical cross section. Events produced with alpgen using the ME calculation are passed to pythia, and the MLM matching procedure is used to avoid double counting. For the matching of ME partons to jets, the lower jet p T threshold is set to 20 GeV/c and the maximum distance between partons and jets is kept to its default value of R = 0.7.",

In order to estimate the effect of this difference on the event-shape distributions, a new response matrix is determined from a MC sample in which the jet energies are smeared by an additional 10%. The differences between the original event-shape and the unfolded event-shape distributions obtained with the new response matrix are found to be below 1%.",

We checked that the differences between the unfolded data and each generator-level sample were comparable with the differences found between data before unfolding and the corresponding full-simulation sample. Here, the agreement between event-shape distributions in data and simu-lation was quantified by a \u03c7 2 statistic. We also ranked the simulated samples by their increasing agreement with the data, and checked that the ranking was the same before and after unfolding. Alternative unfolding methods [22] were applied; the resulting event-shape distributions differed by less than 1% from the results of the SVD unfolding. We also determined the response matrix using MadGraph MC samples instead of pythia6 samples and found no significant differences. The increase in the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC was accompanied by an increase in the average number of interactions per bunch crossing. The effect on the event-shape distributions was checked by measuring these distributions separately for events with exactly one, two, and more than two primary vertices. The resulting three sets of distributions were found to agree within statistical errors.",

The measured event-shape distributions are presented after correction for the detector response. We compare them with predictions from the pythia6, pythia8, herwig++, MadGraph, and alpgen MC generators. The event-shape distributions from pythia6, pythia8, and herwig++ show satisfactory agreement with the data, while discrepancies are found between the data and predictions from alpgen and MadGraph. These measurements provide input for the improvement of currently available models of QCD multijet production. CIENCIAS ",
