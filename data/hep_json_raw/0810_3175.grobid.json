In addition to producing fluxes of high-intensity neutrons, the interaction of the proton beam with the liquid mercury target produces copious pions. The \u03c0 + and subsequent \u00b5 + decay at rest, providing a neutrino beam comprising \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e , and anti-\u03bd \u00b5 components. This neutrino beam is ideal for high-precision neutrino experiments. OscSNS [2] is a proposed multi-purpose experiment that will perform a search for light sterile neutrinos, search for beyond the Standard Model interactions using neutrino oscillations, and provide tests of Standard Model predictions through world-record precision neutrino cross section measurements. OscSNS plans to submit a full proposal for funding in 2009.",

This pulse width is significantly shorter than previous accelerator based neutrino experiments LSND [3] and MiniBooNE [4].",

This type of beam also provides an extremely well defined neutrino flux. Two potential disadvantages to a decay at rest neutrino beam are that the beam is isotropic, and that the lower energy flux limits the choice of neutrino interactions you can examine. These two disadvantages are not concerns for OscSNS. The SNS produces an extremely high neutrino flux. With one year of run time OscSNS will far surpass the statistical size of several important neutrino measurement samples. Also, these low energy interactions are precisely the ones the OscSNS is interested in measuring.",

Appearance Analyses Appearance searches at the SNS will be performed using charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) interactions. These searches will probe higher \u0394m 2 (0.01 to 1000 eV 2 ) and lower sin 2 2\u03b8 (down to ~0.0001), in a region that will impact supernova and big bang nucelosynthesis modeling. The two appearance analyses employ a two-fold coincidence to separate candidate events from background sources. For the anti-\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192anti-\u03bd e search the signal is a positron in coincidence with a 2.2 MeV \u03b3: anti\u03bd e p \u2192 e + n, followed by np \u2192 D\u03b3. This is an exceptionally clean channel. Intrinsic anti-\u03bd e backgrounds can only come from \u00b5 -, which are fairly non-existent at the SNS. For the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e search the signal is an electron in coincidence with a positron, from the \u03b2 decay of the ground state of 12 N: \u03bd e 12 C \u2192 e -12 N gs , followed by 12 N gs \u2192 12 Ce + \u03bd e . The \u03bd \u00b5 engaging in these oscillations are mono-energetic; this greatly limits the energy range for the produced positron and electron, and adds an additional layer of rejection of the intrinsic \u03bd e backgrounds.",
