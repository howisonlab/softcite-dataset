We use B 0 \u2192 K S \u03c0 decays for both mixing-induced and direct CP violating asymmetry measurements and B 0 \u2192 K 0 L \u03c0 0 decays for the direct CP violation measurement. The CP violation parameters obtained are sin 2\u03c6 eff 1 = +0.67 \u00b1 0.31(stat) \u00b1 0.08(syst) and A K 0 \u03c0 0 = +0.14 \u00b1 0.13(stat) \u00b1 0.06(syst). The branching fraction of B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 decay is measured to be B(B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (8.7 \u00b1 0.5(stat.) \u00b1 0.6(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22126 . The observed A K 0 \u03c0 0 value differs by 1.9 standard deviations from the value expected from an isospin sum rule. Decays of B mesons mediated by b \u2192 s penguin amplitudes play an important role in both measuring the Standard Model (SM) parameters and in probing new physics. In the SM, CP violation arises from a single irreducible Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) phase [1], in the weak-interaction quark-mixing matrix. In the decay sequences \u03a5(4S) \u2192 B 0B0 \u2192 f CP f tag , where one of the B mesons decays at time t CP to a CP eigenstate f CP and the other decays at time t tag to a final state f tag that distinguishes between B 0 andB 0 , the decay rate has a time dependence given by P(\u2206t) = e \u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4 B 0 4\u03c4 B 0 1 + q \u2022 S f sin(\u2206m d \u2206t)",

The SM predicts S f = \u2212\u03be f sin 2\u03c6 1 and A f \u2243 0 to a good approximation for most of the decays that proceed via b \u2192 sqq (q = c, s, d, u) quark transitions [2], where \u03be f = +1(\u22121) corresponds to CP -even (-odd) final states and \u03c6 1 is an angle of the unitarity triangle. The final state K 0 S \u03c0 0 is a CP eigenstate with CP eigenvalue \u03be f = \u22121 while K 0 L \u03c0 0 is a CP eigenstate with \u03be f = +1. However, even within the SM, in B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 decay modes, both S K 0 \u03c0 0 and A K 0 \u03c0 0 could be shifted due to the contribution of a color-suppressed tree diagram that has a V ub coupling [3]. The resulting effective parameter sin 2\u03c6 eff 1 can be evaluated in the 1/m b expansion and/or using SU(3) flavor symmetry [4], whereas the shift in A K 0 \u03c0 0 is predicted by applying an isospin sum rule to the recent measurements of B meson decays into K\u03c0 final states [5]. The sum rule for the decay rates gives the following relation to within a few percent precision determined by SU(2) flavor symmetry [6],",

Since the branching fractions and CP asymmetries of other B \u2192 K\u03c0 decay modes have been measured with good precision [7,8], A K 0 \u03c0 0 is constrained in this framework with a small error. Therefore, a significant discrepancy between the measured and expected values of A K 0 \u03c0 0 would indicate a new physics contribution to the sum rule. The expected uncertainty in A K 0 \u03c0 0 can be reduced by improved measurement of the B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 branching fraction. Furthermore, recent measurements that show an unexpectedly large difference between A K + \u03c0 \u2212 and A K + \u03c0 0 [8,9] makes an improved measurement of A K 0 \u03c0 0 particularly interesting. In this paper, in addition to the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 mode, we measure the CP asymmetry in B 0 \u2192 K 0 L \u03c0 0 decay for the first time, in order to maximize sensitivity to the direct CP violation parameter, A K 0 \u03c0 0 .",

The f tag vertex is obtained with well-reconstructed tracks that are not assigned to the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 decay.

The signal yields are obtained from multi-dimensional extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits to these distributions. The M bc , \u2206E and R s/b signal shapes for B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 are modeled with three-dimensional histograms determined from MC, while the continuum background shapes in M bc and \u2206E are modeled with an AR-GUS function [23] and a linear function, respectively, whose shape and normalization are floated in the fit. The data from a sideband region (5.20 GeV/c 2 < M bc < 5.26 GeV/c 2 and 0.05 < \u2206E < 0.20 GeV) are used to determine the continuum background shape in R s/b . For B 0 \u2192 K 0 L \u03c0 0 , the signal shape in M bc is determined from MC samples and the continuum background shape is modeled with an ARGUS function. The signal shape in R s/b is determined from MC simulation. The continuum R s/b shape is determined using \u03a5(4S) off-resonance data. The shape of each variable in the BB background component is modeled using MC events. The signal yield is extracted in each r-bin for B 0 \u2192 K L \u03c0 0 candidates with r-dependent R s/b shapes. For B 0 \u2192 K 0 L \u03c0 0 , the ratio of BB background to signal is evaluated from MC simulated events and the BB background contribution is then fixed according to that of the signal in the fit.",
