Theses masses are located somewhat above the mass range in which existing experiments have reached sensitivity to benchmark QCD axion models. Our haloscope consists of an array of small microwave cavities connected by rectangular irises, in an arrangement commonly used in radio-frequency filters. The size of the unit cavity determines the main resonant frequency, while the possibility to connect a large number of cavities allows to reach large detection volumes. We develop the theoretical framework of the detection concept, and present design prescriptions to optimize detection capabilities. We describe the design and realization of a first small-scale prototype of this concept, called Relic Axion Detector Exploratory Setup (RADES). It consists of a copper-coated stainless steel five-cavities microwave filter with the detecting mode operating at around 8.4 GHz. This structure has been electromagnetically characterized at 2 K and 298 K, and it is now placed in ultra-high vacuum in one of the twin-bores of the 9 T CAST dipole magnet at CERN. We describe the data acquisition system developed for relic axion detection, and present preliminary results of the electromagnetic properties of the microwave filter, which show the potential of filters to reach QCD axion window sensitivity at X-band frequencies.",

Axions arise in extensions of the SM including the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism [1,2], currently the most compelling solution [3,4] to the strong-CP problem of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD). More generic ALPs often appear in diverse types of SM extensions. Not necessarily related to the axion, ALPs share part of its phenomenology. For example, it is now known that string theory naturally predicts many ALPs (and the axion itself) [5]. Beyond their motivation from theoretical arguments, there are additional arguments motivating their existence coming from cosmology and astrophysics. Most relevantly, axions are strong candidates to compose all or part of the dark matter (DM).",

For both mechanisms, the production is approximately inversely proportional to the axion mass, which means that the condition of overproduction of relic axion density translates into a lower bound on the axion mass. However, the computation of the relic axion density for a given axion model and, correspondingly, the axion mass for which the right DM density is obtained, is in general rather uncertain. This is due to dependencies on axion cosmology model and, in the case of the TD, on computational difficulties.",

            "text": "For axion models with PQ transition happening before inflation, only the VR contribution needs to be considered (TD are removed by inflation), but it turns out to be dependent on the unknown value of the initial misalignment angle \u03b8 i , unique for all the observable Universe. Assuming a natural O(1) value for this angle, it would translate to axion masses at the \u223c 10 \u00b5eV scale, but much lower mass values could be justified by anthropically finetuned values of \u03b8 i [7]. For axion models with PQ transition happening after inflation, the VR contribution is calculated over an averaged value of \u03b8 i , thus removing the previous uncertainty. Therefore for these models one can safely set a lower bound to the axion mass of, at least, m A 25\u00b5eV, but possibly higher, depending on the importance of the TD contribution. However this contribution is difficult to compute, as it requires detailed numerical simulation of the behavior of the defects. A recent study [6] claims that TD contribution is dominant, and therefore shifts the right axion mass up to the 80-130 \u00b5eV. A more recent attempt to quantify this contribution [8] provides a lower range m A = 26.2 \u00b1 3.4 \u00b5eV. In addition, one must note that in particular models in which the TD are long-lived, due to the existence of several almost-degenerate vacua in the axion potential, the TD contribution can be substantially increased, and therefore the right axion mass can go to much larger values [6]. Moreover, if the axion is a subdominant part of DM, the axion mass also moves to correspondingly higher values. On more general grounds, the VR mechanism is common also to generic ALPs, and a large fraction of the ALP parameter space can also potentially contain viable ALP DM models [9]. To summarize, although a large mass-range is in principle open to axion DM exploration, there is a specific motivation to extend the sensitivity of conventional searches, so far competitive in the low mass range 1-10 \u00b5eV, to higher values.",

Being non-relativistic, the axions convert to monochromatic photons with energy equal to m A . For a cavity whose resonant frequency matches m A , the conversion is enhanced by a factor proportional to the quality factor of the cavity Q. For a high Q cavity, the resonant band is small and thus the cavity must be tunable and data taking is performed by scanning very thin mass-slices of parameter space.

The ADMX collaboration [12] has demonstrated that this technique is competitive in the 1 to 10 \u00b5eV range and it has realistic prospects to explore this range down to the QCD axion sensitivity in the near future. Pushing these prospects to higher masses is challenging, because it requires to make the cavity resonant to higher frequencies, which means a reduced volume V , and correspondingly reduced sensitivity. One can in principle compensate the loss in V by improving other parameters, like Q, B or T and indeed substantial effort in these directions is ongoing in the community. But a most appealing option would be to effectively increase V by filling a large volume with many high-frequency resonant structures, i.e. effectively decoupling the detection volume V from the volume of a cavity and the resonant frequency. Literally replicating a cavity many times and combining their output is possible in theory, although difficult in practice due to the need to phase match them, and probably it will be challenging to scale it above a few cavities. An alternative approach is to design extended periodic structures that could in principle fill large volumes while coherently resonating at a high frequency. The need of tuning the resonant frequency and keeping competitive values for the rest of parameters still makes this option challenging, although promising recent ideas are being tested [13][14][15].",

            "text": "We here propose and develop another particular realization of this idea, in which the high-frequency resonant structure is an array of N small rectangular cavities connected with irises. Such an arrangement (see Figure 1) resembles that of a radio-frequency (RF) filter, although, as will be seen later, it differs in its design parameters. We find that this concept allows for an (in principle) arbitrarily large magnetic volume to be instrumented with cavities, while the resonant frequency is (mostly) determined by the size of a single element. One single readout channel is foreseen for the full array, i.e avoiding the need of challenging offline signal combination and phase matching. In addition, the geometrical layout of such arrangement could be realized in different ways, providing flexibility in instrumenting a large magnetic volume. The motivation for considering this setup is manifold. First, we would like to develop a technique that prioritizes scaling-up in V , even at the cost of trading-off in other parameters, like, e.g. Q. The goal is to take advantage of large magnetic volumes in already existing infrastructures that could be made available to this type of research. The CAST magnet is one such existing example. It has been already used for \u223c15 years for solar axion searches and is now partially devoted to host axion haloscope test setups. It is a 10-meter long, 2\u00d715 cm 2 aperture, 9 T superconducting dipole, which corresponds to a total B 2 V = 2.4 T 2 m 3 (to be compared, e.g., to the B 2 V \u223c 11 T 2 m 3 of the ADMX magnet). The ambitious goal would be to instrument something like the magnet of the future axion helioscope IAXO [16], a dedicated toroidal magnet with B 2 V 300 T 2 m 3 with similarly large aspect ratio. These numbers are very promising to extract axion DM signals provided ways to efficiently use this magnetic volume are developed. Second, arranging the cavities in 1-dimensional arrays is perfectly suitable to instrument magnets with large aspect-ratios like the ones of CERN accelerator magnets or the future IAXO. Third, the weak linear coupling between cavities through small irises allows a very simple theoretical description that can greatly aid the design of multiple cavities. Fourth, tuning haloscopes composed of multiple subcavities can be really challenging. To simplify the design we considered many cavities optimized around a central frequency with simple and robust tuning mechanisms to allow retuning in a small range around the central peak (\u223c 10%). This strategy would be compromised if the design phase was long and complicated; the theoretical guidance described in the following sections is a key part of the conceptual design adopted.",

RADES is part of the new experimental program of CAST, presented and approved by CERN SPSC in 2015 [17], and now under implementation. As a first step, a small-scale RADES cavity with 5 elements and no tuning has been built and installed inside the CAST magnet for operation in the current data taking campaign of the experiment. We must note that another complementary idea to make use of large aspectratio magnetic volumes, based on the use of single long rectangular cavities [18], is also being tested at the CAST magnet by the CAST-CAPP team. Furthermore, the cavity array concept independently proposed in [19] shares some conceptual elements with our proposal. In particular, the authors of [19] identify some of the merits of cavity structures that will be developed in our work, in particular regarding the scalability in V for high frequency operation. We here further develop the concept by providing a prescription to optimize the coupling of the structure with the axion field. Moreover, we propose a different practical implementation based on a filter-like structure (while in [19] a series of posts or coils are proposed instead), and we present feasibility results, both based on complete simulations and on a first experimental prototype. Finally, we recently realised that a very similar implementation to the one here discussed, an array of cavities interconnected with irises, was already mentioned by D. Morris in an unpublished preprint [20] from 1984.",

Consequently, it can be maximized by forcing the electric field in all five cavities to be aligned with the applied magnetic field. The geometric factors of each individual cavity in a constant external magnetic field B e are very similar. This is because they are similar in size and working on the fundamental mode so the vector of geometric factors is G (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) \u00d7 G, with G the geometric factor of a cavity. Maximum coupling can thus be obtained when one of the filter eigenmodes is e = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)/ \u221a N .

The determination of the value of W that corresponds to a given k (1) is achieved by numerical simulations. By standard calculations of inter-resonator coupling, using symmetry, two coupled resonators connected by an inductive iris can be divided into two single resonators, one terminated by a magnetic wall and the other by an electric wall. The coupling k (1) is then determined from the resonant frequencies of the two individual resonators [23]. Using this method, we can obtain k (1) for each physical width W .

A copper coating layer with approximately 30 \u00b5m thickness has been applied to the structure to improve the electrical conductivity. This copper layer is expected to have a residual resistance ratio (RRR) between 30 and 200 but at the frequencies of interest the anomalous skin-depth effect [25,26] moderates the increase in conductivity, resulting in a lower increase in Q than otherwise expected from the RRR. A higher quality factor could have been obtained by means of a silver outer layer, but this solution was ruled out since it would require a nickel layer between stainless steel and silver, which is incompatible with the high magnetic field environment of CAST. The effect of the stainless steel on losses is negligible since the thickness of the copper layer is much larger than the skin depth for copper at 8.4 GHz (0.7 \u00b5m at room temperature and 0.1 \u00b5m at 2 K). A linear correction expansion coefficient has been applied in the manufacturing process to compensate the change in the physical dimensions due to the temperature expansion from 2 K to room temperature. The expansion coefficients for the stainless steel can be found in [27].",

In Figure 5 the measured transmission scattering parameter of the filter S 12 is shown at room temperature (upper plot) and at 2.13 K (bottom plot) for frequencies around 8.4 GHz. In both cases the five resonant peaks of the filter are clearly seen. The slight frequency displacement of the peaks (see Table 3) is compatible with the contraction of the dimensions at cryogenic temperatures. While the data at room temperature were taken at the laboratory with the cavity directly connected to the VNA, the data at 2.13 K were taken including the cables and amplifier and with the input signal properly attenuated at 0 dB to avoid saturation of the cryogenic amplifier, which explains the additional spectral features in the plot.

All matrix parameters in 2.2 are allowed to vary independently to find the best fit (including an imaginary part for the diagonal elements to allow for cavity losses and properly fit the width of the peaks), as well as a overall normalization. So the system is allowed to depart from the optimal solution defined in section 2. The result of the fit to the 298 K data, shown as gray line in Fig. 5, is able to reproduce the measured data remarkably. Then we check that the solution found in this way shows only a very mild departure from the optimal solution and, most importantly, its geometric factor is within 0.1% of the maximum value expected for the optimal solution. The same solution is overlaid with the 2 K data, only readjusting the normalization and the \u03c9 1 to account for the temperature contraction. For the current prototype, we consider that the cross-checks presented confirm our understanding of the system, and that the fabricated prototype enjoys a field distribution very similar to the one intended. Further work will go in the direction of better establishing this protocol of comparisons of experimental data with both simulations and analytical model, in order to assess the requirements in terms of mechanical tolerances required for larger, more demanding RADES prototypes. In addition, the output power due to axion DM can be computed immediately with the help of (A.22), obtaining the red curves of Fig. 5. We have normalized the curves to the maximum power on resonance. As designed, only the first peak couples to the axion.",

The approximation is due to the fact that we have also used R \u22121 R T . Both matrices are exactly the same when \u2126 is real, and approximately equal when the imaginary components (due to losses being very small) are small. The interpretation of the above formula is clear when we compare it with its 1-cavity counterpart, (A.7). The original fundamental mode has split into N modes of the array and so the electric-field in the q-th cavity, (\u039e) q , is now a linear superposition of the electric-fields of each array mode i in that cavity. Each array mode contribution is weighted by the resonator response factor (\u03c9 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 i ) \u22121 and the corresponding geometric factor e i \u2022 G. This last quantity is precisely what one would expect from a geometric factor because the sum of individual integrals can be understood as a global E E \u2022 B e integral. In other words, the axion DM field oscillating at \u03c9, excites every mode of the array with a weight given by e i \u2022 J A /(\u03c9 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 i ). The electric field in a cavity of the array is the superposition of the E-fields of each mode. Note that all modes oscillate at the same frequency, being forced by the axion field, but they can have different phases and can cancel partially or totally. The interference is dictated by the sign of the geometric factor and the sign of \u03c9 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 i (whether \u03c9 is above the resonant frequency \u03c9 i or below).",

Let us discuss the relation of the filter properties with the individual properties of each cavity. The eigenfrequencies \u2126 2 i are given by the diagonalisation of the matrix M and so are the imaginary parts. However, if the imaginary parts are very small, as will be our case, one can diagonalise Re{M} with an orthonormal basis {e} and compute the losses of the i-th mode as a perturbation 19) which follows from the definition (A.14) because Im{M} = diag{\u03c9\u0393 1 , ..., \u03c9\u0393 N } is a diagonal matrix. The last formula has the obvious interpretation of a reweighed sum of losses according to the energy stored in each cavity. If the cavities are very similar, as will be our case, the intrinsic losses in each of them are very similar, \u0393 c q \u223c \u0393 c 0 , and thus we obtain",
