We fit the inclusive electron spectrum to distinguish CKM suppressed B \u2192 Xue\u03bd decays from the CKM favored B \u2192 Xce\u03bd decays, and from various other backgrounds, and determine the total semileptonic branching fraction B(B \u2192 Xe\u03bd) = (10.34 \u00b1 0.04stat \u00b1 0.26syst)%, averaged over B \u00b1 and B 0 mesons. We determine the spectrum and branching fraction for charmless B \u2192 Xue\u03bd decays and extract the CKM element |V ub |, by relying on four different QCD calculations based on the Heavy Quark Expansion. While experimentally, the electron momentum region above 2.1 GeV/c is favored, because the background is relatively low, the uncertainties for the theoretical predictions are largest in the region near the kinematic endpoint. Detailed studies to assess the impact of these four predictions on the measurements of the electron spectrum, the branching fraction, and the extraction of the CKM matrix element |V ub | are presented, with the lower limit on the electron momentum varied from 0.8 GeV/c to the kinematic endpoint. We determine |V ub | using each of these different calculations and find, |V ub | = (3.794 \u00b1 0.107exp +0.292    \u22120.219 SF +0.078 \u22120.068 theory ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 (DN), (4.563 \u00b1 0.126exp +0.230 \u22120.208 SF +0.162 \u22120.163 theory ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 (BLNP), (3.959 \u00b1 0.104exp +0.164 \u22120.154 SF +0.042",

They are expected to be free of non-Standard Model contributions and therefore play a critical role in the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [1] elements |V cb | and |V ub |. In the Standard Model (SM), the CKM elements satisfy unitarity relations that can be illustrated geometrically as triangles in the complex plane. For one of these triangles, CP asymmetries determine the angles, |V cb | normalizes the length of the sides, and the ratio |V ub |/|V cb | determines the side opposite the well-measured angle \u03b2. Thus, precise measurements of |V cb | and |V ub | are crucial to studies of flavor physics and CP-violation in the quark sector.",

The upper limit of the fitted range of the momentum spectrum is fixed at 3.5 GeV/c, while the lower limit extends down to 0.8 GeV/c, covering up to 90% of the total signal electron spectrum.

The most important components for this study are the charged-particle tracking system, consisting of a five-layer silicon vertex tracker and a 40-layer cylindrical drift chamber, and the electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 6580 CsI(Tl) crystals. These detector components operated in a 1.5 T magnetic field parallel to the beam. Electron candidates are selected on the basis of the ratio of the energy deposited in the calorimeter to the track momentum, the shower shape, the energy loss in the drift chamber, and the angle of signals in a ring-imaging Cerenkov detector. Showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter with energies below 50 MeV which are dominated by beam background are not used in this analysis.",

They are simulated separately using the ISGW2 model [20] and added to samples of decays to non-resonant and higher mass resonant states X nr u , so that the cumulative distributions of the hadron mass, the momentum transfer squared, and the electron momentum reproduce the inclusive calculation as closely as possible.

Based on HQE the total inclusive rate can be predicted with an uncertainty of about 5%, however, this rate is very difficult to measure due to very large background from the CKM-favored B \u2192 X c \u2113\u03bd decays. On the other hand, in the endpoint region where the signal to background ratio is much more favorable, calculations of the differential decay rates are much more complicated. They require the inclusion of additional perturbative and non-perturbative effects. These calculations rely on HQE and QCD factorization [35] and separate perturbative and non-perturbative effects by using an expansion in powers of 1/m b and a non-perturbative shape function (SF) which is a priori unknown. This function accounts for the motion of the b quark inside the B meson, and to leading order, it should be universal for all transitions of a b quark to a light quark [36,37]. It is modeled using arbitrary functions for which low-order moments are constrained by measurable parameters.",

In the following, we briefly describe four different theoretical methods to derive predictions for the partial and total BFs. In the original work by De Fazio and Neubert (DN) [19] and Kagan and Neubert [38] the determination of |V ub | relies on the measurement of the electron spectrum for B \u2192 X u e\u03bd and on the radiative decays B \u2192 X s \u03b3 to derive the parameters of the leading SF. More comprehensive calculations were performed by Bosch, Lange, Neubert, and Paz (BLNP) [39][40][41][42][43][44][45]. Calculations in the kinetic scheme were introduced by Gambino, Giordano, Ossola, Uraltsev (GGOU) [46,47]. BLNP and GGOU use B \u2192 X c \u2113\u03bd and B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decays to derive the parameters of the leading SF. Inclusive spectra for B \u2192 X u e\u03bd decays based on a calculation of non-perturbative functions using Sudakov resummation are presented in the dressed gluon exponentiation (DGE) by Andersen and Gardi [48][49][50][51].",

In the region close to phase-space boundaries these non-perturbative corrections to the spectrum are large. The prediction for the decay distribution is obtained by a convolution of the parton model spec-trum with the SF. The SF is described by two pa-rameters\u039b SF = M B \u2212 m b and \u03bb SF 1 which were determined from the measured photon energy moments in B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decays [38].

The results of these fits are shown in Table III, and for the fit with the GGOU signal spectrum, the correlation matrix is presented in Table IV. The differences of the correlation matrices for the fit with DN, BLNP, GGOU and DGE signal spectra are small. The difference in the fit results for the B \u2192 X u e\u03bd BF is primarily due to the difference between the various predictions for the fraction of the signal spectrum in the high momentum range. The fitted BFs for the dominant B \u2192 X c e\u03bd decays agree reasonably well with expectations [2].",

The thickness of the material was verified using electrons from Bhabha scattering as a function of the polar angle relative to the beam. The impact of the uncertainty in the energy loss on the signal rate was estimated by calculating the impact of an additional 0.0014X 0 of material.

For values less than 2.05 GeV/c, the uncertainty on the BF increases significantly, and for values greater than 2.1 GeV/c, the fit quality diminishes because the data and the predicted spectra differ at higher momenta. The impact of this sensitivity is estimated as the difference between the nominal fit with 2.1 \u2212 2.7 GeV/c and a fit with a slightly lower boundary of the bin, 2.05 \u2212 2.7 GeV/c.

As in earlier measurements based on the lepton momentum spectrum, the uncertainties on the B \u2192 X u e\u03bd lepton spectrum and the extraction of |V ub | are dominated by the current knowledge of the shapes of signal and background spectra, in particular in the theoretical predictions of the spectrum, both in terms of perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the predicted rate.

For BLNP and GGOU: solid squares -Xc\u2113\u03bd moment fits with mc constraint (BLNP1 and GGOU1), solid triangles -Xc\u2113\u03bd and Xs\u03b3 moment fits (BLNP3 and GGOU2), open squares or triangles -the same constraints for translation of SF parameters from \"kinetic\" to \"shape-function\" scheme with \u00b5i=1.5 GeV (BLNP2 and BLNP4).",
