The results on multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations significantly deviate from expectations for the independent particle production. They also depend on charges of selected hadrons. The string-resonance Monte Carlo models Epos and Urqmd do not describe the data. The scaled variance of multiplicity fluctuations is significantly higher in inelastic p+p interactions than in central Pb+Pb collisions measured by NA49 at the same energy per nucleon. This is in qualitative disagreement with the predictions of the Wounded Nucleon Model. Within the statistical framework the enhanced multiplicity fluctuations in inelastic p+p interactions can be interpreted as due to event-by-event fluctuations of the fireball energy and/or volume.",

The measurements were performed by the multi-purpose NA61/SHINE [1,2] experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). They are part of the strong interaction program devoted to the study of the properties of the onset of deconfinement and search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter. Within this program a two-dimensional scan in collision energy and size of colliding nuclei is in progress. Data on p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions were already recorded and data on p+Pb and Xe+La collisions will be registered within the coming years. The expected signal of a critical point is a non-monotonic dependence of various fluctuation measures in such a scan, for recent review see Ref. [3].",

The secondary beam momentum and intensity was adjusted by proper setting of the H2 beam-line magnet currents and collimators. The beam was transported along the H2 beam-line towards the experiment. The precision of the setting of the beam magnet currents was approximately 0.5%. This was verified by a direct measurement of the beam momentum at 31 GeV/c by bending the incoming beam particles into the TPCs with the maximum magnetic field [19]. Selected beam properties are given in Table 2. The setup of the beam detectors is illustrated in the inset on Fig. 1. Protons from the secondary hadron beam were identified by two Cherenkov counters, a CEDAR (either CEDAR-W or CEDAR-N) and a threshold counter (THC). The CEDAR counter, using a coincidence of six out of the eight photo-multipliers placed radially along the Cherenkov ring, provided positive identification of protons, while the THC, operated at pressure lower than the proton threshold, was used in anti-coincidence in the trigger logic. Due to their limited range of operation two different CEDAR counters were employed, namely for beams at 20, 31, and 40 GeV/c the CEDAR-W counter and for beams at 80 and 158 GeV/c the CEDAR-N counter. The threshold counter was used for 20, 31, and 40 GeV/c beams. A selection based on signals from the Cherenkov counters allowed one to identify beam protons with a purity of about 99%. A consistent value for the purity was found by bending the 30.1 GeV/c beam into the TPCs with the full magnetic field and using the dE/dx identification method. The fraction of protons in the beams is given in Table 2.",

Statistical and systematic uncertainties (see below) of the fully corrected points are also plotted for comparison. The corrections for off-target interactions only weakly change the results. The corrections for the remaining experimental biases have significant impact in particular on results for \u03c9[N ] and \u0394[P T , N ]. It is mostly due to the requirement of a well-fitted interaction vertex as well as corrections for the trigger bias and the off-line selection of events. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 where the collision energy dependence of \u03c9[N ] and \u0394[P T , N ] for fully corrected data, uncorrected for the trigger bias, uncorrected for the trigger bias and for the off-line event selection as well as fully uncorrected data are presented. In addition, the results with all corrections but the correction for the contribution of non-primary tracks (feeddown) are shown. . For each beam momentum, 5 million events were generated and reconstructed, several times more than the recorded experimental data. Therefore statistical uncertainties arising from the event statistics of the simulation were neglected.",

The number of wounded nucleons (protons) in p+p interactions is fixed to two and the measured scaled variance for p+p interactions can be used as \u03c9 * [N ]. The second component of the sum Eq. 11 vanishes or is positive. Consequently the WNM predicts that the scaled variance in nucleus-nucleus collisions has to be equal to or larger than the one in inelastic proton-proton interactions. The NA61/ SHINE and NA49 results presented in Fig. 12 clearly contradict this prediction. Note that at SPS energies multiplicity distributions of negatively charged hadrons in inelastic p+p, n+p and n+n interactions are different [32]. The largest difference is observed between the distributions in p+p and n+n interactions. Thus the prediction of the WNM for Pb+Pb collisions which takes into account the isospin effects estimated using the Epos model ranges between the results for p+p (the measured NA61/SHINE data) and n+n interactions (estimated based on the Epos predictions and the NA61/SHINE data).

Its basic assumption states that all possible micro-states of the macroscopic system created in a collision are equally probable. For a non-interacting (ideal) gas of Boltzmann particles in the grand canonical ensemble (IB-GCE) the multiplicity distribution is Poissonian (\u03c9[N ] = 1) independent of the (fixed) system volume (upper dashed line in Fig. 12 (right)). Resonance decays and Bose effects increase the scaled variance from 1 to 1.1, whereas the conservation laws reduce it if the system volume is sufficiently large [31]. The combined effect is demonstrated by the lower dashed line in Fig. 12 (right). In fact the NA49 result for the 1% most central Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV/c is well described by the hadron gas model in the micro-canonical ensemble (HG-MCE) [31]. Within the statistical models a scaled variance significantly larger than one as measured in inelastic p+p interactions at high collision energies (top SPS and higher) can be understood as a result of volume and/or energy fluctuations [33].",
