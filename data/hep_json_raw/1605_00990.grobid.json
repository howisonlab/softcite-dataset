The first search for \u03a5(1S) decays into XY Z states that decay into a J/\u03c8 or a \u03c8(2S) plus one or two charged tracks yields no significant signals for XY Z states in any of the examined decay modes, and upper limits on their production rates in \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays are determined. During the past twelve years many charmoniumlike states, the so-called \"XY Z\" particles, have been reported [1]. Most cannot be described well by quarkonium potential models [1][2][3]. Their unusual properties have stimulated considerable theoretical interest and various interpretations have been proposed, including tetraquarks, molecules, hybrids, or hadrocharmonia [1,3,4]. To distinguish among these explanations, more experimental information is needed, such as additional production processes and/or more decay modes for these states. States with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 can be studied with initial state radiation in Belle's and BaBar's large \u03a5(4S) data samples or via direct production in e + e \u2212 collisions at BESIII. There is very little available information on XY Z production in the decays of narrow \u03a5 states apart from the searches for charge-parity-even charmoniumlike states in \u03a5(1S) [5] and \u03a5(2S) [6] radiative decays. A common feature of these XY Z states is that they decay into a charmonium state such as J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) and light hadrons. Inclusive decays of \u03a5(1S) into J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) are observed with large branching fractions of (6.5 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7,8] and (2.7 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7], respectively, in which some of the XY Z states might have been produced before decaying into J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S).",

The analysis utilizes a 5.74 fb \u22121 data sample collected at the peak of the \u03a5(1S) resonance, containing 102 \u00d7 10 6 \u03a5(1S) decays, and a 89.45 fb \u22121 data sample collected offresonance at \u221a s = 10.52 GeV that is used to determine the levels of possible irreducible continuum contributions. The data were collected with the Belle detector [23,24] operated at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [25,26]. Large Monte Carlo (MC) event samples of each of the investigated XY Z modes are generated with EVTGEN [27] to determine signal line-shapes and efficiencies. Both XY Z meson production in \u03a5(1S) in-clusive decays and their decays into exclusive final states containing a J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) and light hadrons are generated uniformly in phase space. Inclusive J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) production is generated in the same models and subsequently decay according to their known branching fractions [28]; unknown decay modes are generated using the Lund fragmentation model in PYTHIA [29].",

Backgrounds from QED processes are significantly suppressed by the requirement that the charged multiplicity (N ch ) in each event satisfies N ch > 4 [30].

Figure 4(a) shows the K + K \u2212 J/\u03c8 invariant mass distributions for the candidate \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays. The fit to the spectrum of M (K + K \u2212 J/\u03c8) is performed above 4.10 GeV/c 2 , which is somewhat above the K + K \u2212 J/\u03c8 mass threshold of 4.085 GeV/c 2 . The invariant mass distributions of the K + K \u2212 \u03c8(2S) candidates in \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) for \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, respectively. The slant-shaded histograms (the scaled continuum backgrounds) overlie the cross-shaded ones that represent the normalized \u03c8(2S) mass sideband. No evidence is found for new structures or any of the known XY Z states. The Y (4140) and X(4350) states have been reported in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 decay channel by CDF [15] and Belle [16]. Figure 5 shows the \u03c6J/\u03c8 and \u03c6\u03c8(2S) invariant mass distributions, where the few events that survive do not appear to have any statistically significant clustering near 4140 MeV/c 2 , 4350 MeV/c 2 nor any other mass. The results of a fit to M (\u03c6J/\u03c8) in Fig. 5(a) are shown as a solid curve.  \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)). Figure 6 shows the \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8, \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(2S)(\u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ), and \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(2S)(\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) invariant mass distributions for the \u03a5(1S) peak data as well as the fit ranges and results. For all three channels, the background events represent the \u03a5(1S) data well, indicating insignificant production of any Z \u00b1 c states. We do not observe any Z \u00b1 c (3900), Z \u00b1 c (4200) or Z \u00b1 c (4430) signals in the \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 mode nor any Z \u00b1 c (4050) or Z \u00b1 c (4430) signals in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(2S) mode. We search for the predicted Z \u00b1 cs (\u2192 K \u00b1 J/\u03c8) state -the strange partner of Z \u00b1 c (3900) [21,22]-with mass M = (3.97\u00b10.08) GeV/c 2 and width \u0393 = (24.9 \u00b1 12.6) MeV in \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays. The invariant mass distribution of the K \u00b1 J/\u03c8 candidates is presented in Fig. 7(a). No evidence for such a structure is seen near the predicted Z \u00b1 cs mass. The signal significance from the fit is less than 2\u03c3. A fit with a Breit-Wigner that interferes with a smooth background function yields a signal significance of only 1.2\u03c3. In the K \u00b1 \u03c8(2S) mode, no exotic XY Z states have been seen nor predicted. For completeness, we present the invariant mass distributions of the K \u00b1 \u03c8(2S) candidates with the \u03c8(2S) decays into the \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 final states in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c), respectively. The sum of the normalized continuum and sideband backgrounds agrees well with the data.",

            "text": "Several sources of systematic errors are taken into account in the branching fraction measurements. Tracking efficiency uncertainty is estimated to be 0.35% per track with high momentum and is additive. Based on the measurements of the identification efficiencies of lepton pairs from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 events and pions from a low-background sample of D * events, MC simulation yields uncertainties      is the number of fitted signal events, Nup is the upper limit on the number of signal events taking into account systematic errors, \u03b5 is the reconstruction efficiency, \u03c3syst is the total systematic uncertainty, \u03a3 is the signal significance with systematic errors included, and B prod of 1.6% for each lepton, 1.4% for each pion, and 1.3% for each kaon. The trigger efficiency evaluated from simulation is greater than 99.9% with an uncertainty that is negligibly small. The difference in the signal yields when the mass and width of each XY Z state are varied by 1\u03c3 is used as an estimate of the systematic error associated with mass and width uncertainties [28]. In the simulation of generic J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) decays, the unknown decay channels are produced by the Lund fragmentation model in PYTHIA [29]. By generating different sets of MC samples with different relative probabilities to produce the various possible qq (q = u, d, s) pairs in the J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) decays, the largest difference in the efficiencies is found to be less than 0.1% and is neglected. The errors on the branching fractions of the intermediate states are taken from the Particle Data Group tables [28]; these are 1.1%, 6.3%, 1.2%, and 1.0% for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 , \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 , \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, and \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , respectively; the weighted average for the two \u03c8(2S) decay modes is 3.5%. By varying the background shapes, the order of the Chebyshev polynomial and the fitting range, the deviations of the fitted signal yields for J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) productions are estimated for each x bin. The upper limits on the signal yields vary by less than 49.4%, depending on the decay mode. The MC statistical errors are estimated using the reconstruction efficiencies and the number of generated events; these are 1.0% or less. The error on the total number of \u03a5(1S) events is 2.0%. Assuming that all sources are independent, their uncertainties are summed in quadrature. The total systematic errors (\u03c3 syst ) for each channel are listed in Table III. In summary, using the 102 \u00d7 10 6 \u03a5(1S) events collected with the Belle detector, distinct J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) signals are observed in the \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays. The corresponding branching fractions are measured to be B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + anything) = (5.25 \u00b1 0.13(stat.) \u00b1 0.25(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03c8(2S) + anything) = (1.23 \u00b1 0.17(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 with substantially improved precision compared to previous results of (6.5 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7,8] and (2.7 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7] for J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), respectively. Several theoretical papers have suggested the study of J/\u03c8 production in \u03a5(1S) decays as an example of charmonium production mechanisms in gluon-rich environments. Some color-octet [38] and colorsinglet [39] models predict B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + anything) of 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 5.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively. Our measured value is of the same order as the theoretical estimations. We also search for a variety of XY Z states in \u03a5(1S) inclusive decays for the first time, where the XY Z candidates of interest are reconstructed from their final states that contain a J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S)) and up to two charged light hadrons (K \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 ). No evident signal is found for any of them and 90% C.L. upper limits are set on the product branching fractions and listed in Table III. There is no striking evidence for previously unseen structures in K + K \u2212 \u03c8(2S) and K \u00b1 \u03c8(2S) invariant mass distributions.",
