            "text": "After more than 30 years of experimental effort, Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) remain hidden in most recent dark matter direct detection experiments (see Ref. [1] and [2] for a recent review). One possible explanation for the null results in these experiments is that the elastic scattering between the WIMPs and nucleon is heavily suppressed. In some theoretical scenarios [3][4][5], inelastic scattering, in which the dark matter particle converts to an excited state particle with a small mass splitting between the two, becomes dominant. This could explain the observed annual modulation in the DAMA/LIBRA data [6], but the annual modulation in signal was incompatible with the results from several other different experiments [7,8]. In a recent study [9], the inelastic scenario was reconsidered in the full range of inelastic mass splitting allowed by kinematics. The authors argued that the direct detection experiments employing targets with heavy nuclei could be used to explore the so-called \"inelastic frontier\" -in which the dark matter mass splitting is in several hundred keV/c 2 range. They hypothesized that the four events with high nuclear recoil energy identified by the CRESST experiment [10] might be due to the WIMP inelastic scattering.",

The final candidate selection was made by expanding the S1 upper window to 100 PE and S2 (corrected) upper window to 12,000 PE, corresponding to an average upper energy of 18.3 keV ee or 68.6 keV nr .

Firstly, the ER background in higher energy region is greatly enhanced by the 33 keV K-shell x ray generated in the 127 Xe electron capture process. Secondly, our ER background model is only optimized in the region with energy up to the end-point decay energy of tritium, i.e., 18.6 keV ee .

            "text": "ground model as in Ref. [14], the expected total number of background events is 744\u00b188. The expected background composition can be found in Table I. The spatial distribution of events before and after the FV cut with the extended signal range is shown in Fig. 4. The events show good uniformity within the FV. The log 10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 distribution of these events is shown in Fig. 5. The reference line is chosen to be the 35% quantile of the calibration AmBe NR band reported in Ref. [14]. Four events are identified below the line. They are also marked in Fig. 4. The event with the smallest S1 value was also reported in Ref. [14]. The event with a S1 value of 51.8 PE appeared at the top edge of the FV. After further investigation of its waveform, we found that this event contains spurious signals which could be produced by the discharge on the electrodes. The waveforms of the other two events are of good quality. The event with a S1 value of 55.0 PE has a larger distance from the reference line, but it is located close to the bottom of the FV. We used all final 716 candidates to derive the exclusion limits for the scattering cross section between WIMPs and nucleons at the two reference dark matter masses of 1 TeV/c 2 and 10 TeV/c 2 . The profile likelihood fitting was applied to the distribution of S1 and S2. We used identical background models from Ref. [14]. The final 90% confidence level (C.L.) cross section upper limits were calculated with the CLs approach [17,18], and are shown in Fig. 6. In both cases, our limit curves lie between the 1-\u03c3 and 2-\u03c3 sensitivity bands when the mass splitting is within the (100, 200) keV/c 2 range, as a result of three observed events below the reference acceptance line. The limit calculated with data in the original signal window (S1 between 3-45 PE), also shown in the figure, is tighter at lower mass splitting, since only one event was found below the reference line. To study the impact of nuclear recoil model to the derived limit, we also plot the limits calculated based on the \"best-tuned\" NEST from LUX D-D calibration [19] for a WIMP-mass of 1 TeV/c 2 . Due to reduction of the NR acceptance, the alternative limit is weaker but not too far beyond the +1\u03c3 sensitivity band. In comparison to the earlier phenomenological treatment (up to about 200 keV/c 2 for LUX-PandaX-II) in Ref. [9], this analysis extends to a wider mass splitting range up to 300 keV/c 2 . Our results are also incompatible with the hypothesis that the four high nuclear recoil events observed by CRESST [10] were due to inelastic WIMPs with a mass of 1 TeV/c 2 and mass splitting around 200 keV/c 2 (which would suggest a cross section at O(10 \u221239 ) cm 2 ).",
