This is related to the QED vacuum structure and can be detected by measuring the ellipticity acquired by a linearly polarized light beam propagating through a strong magnetic field. Such an effect is predicted by the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. The method is also sensitive to other hypothetical physical effects such as axion-like particles and in general to any fermion/boson millicharged particle. Here we report on the construction of our apparatus based on a high finesse (> 2 \u2022 10 5 ) Fabry-Perot cavity and two 0.9 m long 2.5 T permanent dipole rotating magnets, and on the measurements performed on a scaled down test setup. With the test setup we have improved by about a factor 2 the limit on the parameter Ae describing non linear electrodynamic effects in vacuum: Ae < 2.9 \u2022 10 \u221221 T \u22122 @ 95% c.l.",

Several experimental efforts are underway 1-10 to detect such effects. Indeed QED predicts non linear effects leading to birefringence and light-light scattering (LbL) through the box diagram.

The frequencies   of these peaks are at harmonics of the magnet rotation frequency. The variability of these peaks from one run to another seems to depend (in a non reproducible way) on the adjustment of the input and output polarizers which are done with motorized stages. To study the dependence of such peaks on the magnet orientation, a field probe is present near the output side magnet. Changing the relative orientation of the two magnets does not change the amplitude of these peaks but does change their phase indicating that the more sensitive part of the apparatus seems to be the entrance optics. All the motorized stages have small electric motors which couple to the rotating magnetic field and may introduce beam jitter and therefore ellipticity. The substitution of all these stages is programmed shortly.",

Noise sources are being studied on a bench-top small apparatus in Ferrara, Italy, in view of the construction of the final apparatus with which we hope to measure for the first time the magnetic birefringence of vacuum due to vacuum fluctuations. We have discussed the importance of using two dipole magnets instead of only one whose directions can be made perpendicular to each other in order to have a zero effect condition with the magnetic field present. This is vital to study and eliminate spurious signals generated by the rotating field. A proof of principle measurement using the Cotton-Mouton effect in Oxygen gas was done with the test apparatus in Ferrara, Italy.",
