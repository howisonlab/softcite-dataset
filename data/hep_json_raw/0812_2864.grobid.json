Jets were identified using the k T cluster algorithm in the laboratory frame. Subjets were defined as jet-like substructures identified by a reapplication of the cluster algorithm at a smaller value of the resolution parameter y cut . Measurements of subjet distributions for jets with exactly two subjets for y cut = 0.05 are presented as functions of observables sensitive to the pattern of parton radiation and to the colour e Also working at Max Planck Institute, Munich, Germany.",

The pattern of parton radiation within a jet is dictated in QCD by the splitting functions. These functions, P ab (z, \u03bc) with a, b = q or g, are interpreted as the probability that a parton of type b, having radiated a parton of type a, is left with a fraction z of the longitudinal momentum of the parent parton and a transverse momentum squared smaller than \u03bc 2 , where \u03bc is the typical hard scale of the process. The splitting functions are calculable as power series in \u03b1 s .

One of the goals of this study was to investigate the extent to which pQCD calculations are able to reproduce the observed distributions. In addition, the dependence of the splitting functions P ab (z, \u03bc) on z can be investigated using the E sbj T /E jet T distribution. The splitting functions at leading order (LO) do not depend on \u03bc but acquire a weak dependence due to higherorder corrections. Such a dependence can be investigated by measuring the subjet distributions in different regions of E jet T or Q 2 . The substructure of jets consisting of a quark-gluon pair (the quark-induced process eq \u2192 eqg) or a quark-antiquark pair (the gluon-induced process eg \u2192 eqq) are predicted to be different (see Sect. 8.1). Furthermore, the relative contributions of quark-and gluon-induced processes vary with Bjorken x and Q 2 . The predicted difference mentioned above is amenable to experimental investigation by comparing the shape of the subjet distributions in different regions of x and Q 2 .",

The effects of color coherence between the initial and final states have been studied in hadron-hadron collisions [30]. These effects are also expected to appear in lepton-hadron collisions.

It is to be noted that since the jet axis is reconstructed as the transverse-energy-weighted average of the subjet axes, the subjet with higher E sbj T is constrained to be closer to the jet axis than that of the lower E sbj T subjet. The measured distributions show that the higher (lower) E sbj T subjet tends to be in the rear (forward) direction. All these observations support the expectation of the presence of color-coherence effects between the initial and final states and, in particular, the tendency of the subjet with lower E sbj T to be emitted predominantly towards the proton beam direction. T /E jet T < 0.6, as seen in the data. The calculations for the \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet and \u03b1 sbj distributions predict that the subjet with higher transverse energy tends to be in the rear direction, in agreement with the data.

            "text": "jet T , Q 2 and x dependence of the subjet distributions Figures 6, 7, 8, 9 show the normalized differential subjet cross sections in different regions of E jet T . Even though the mean subjet multiplicity decreases with increasing E jet T [19], the measured normalized differential subjet cross sections have very similar shapes in all E jet T regions for all the observables considered. This means that the subjet topology does not change significantly with E jet T . This is better illustrated in Fig. 10, where the data for all E jet T regions are plotted together. In particular, it is observed that the maximum of each measured normalized cross section in every region of E jet T occurs in the same bin of the distribution. To quantify the E jet T dependence more precisely, Fig. 11 shows the maximum value of the measured normalized cross section for each observable as a function of E jet T together with the NLO predictions. The spread of the measured maximum values of the normalized cross sections is \u00b1(4-6)%. For each observable, the scaling behavior of the normalized differential subjet cross sections is clearly observed and in agreement with the expectation that the splitting functions depend weakly on the energy scale. The NLO QCD calculations are in agreement with the data and support this observation. Figures 12, 13, 14, 15 show the normalized differential subjet cross sections in different regions of Q 2 . In this case, it is observed that while the shape of the E sbj T /E jet T distribution does not change significantly with Q 2 , some dependence can be seen in the other observables. For example, the dip in the \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet distribution is shallower for 125 < Q 2 < 250 GeV 2 than at higher Q 2 and the shape of the \u03b1 sbj distribution for 125 < Q 2 < 250 GeV 2 is somewhat different than for the other regions (see Fig. 16). These features of the data are reasonably reproduced by the NLO QCD calculations and understood as a combination of two effects: the fraction of gluon-induced events is predicted to be 32% for 125 < Q 2 < 250 GeV 2 and below 14% for higher Q 2 ; the shape of the normalized cross sections as functions of \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet and \u03b1 sbj changes from the region 125 < Q 2 < 250 GeV 2 to 250 < Q 2 < 500 GeV 2 (see Fig. 17) for quark-and gluon-induced events. It is observed that the maximum of each measured normalized cross section in every region of Q 2 occurs in the same bin of the distribution, except for |\u03c6 sbj \u2212 \u03c6 jet | in the highest-Q 2 region.             On the other hand, the measured and predicted maximum values for the normalized cross sections as functions of \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet and \u03b1 sbj exhibit a step-like behavior between the lowest-Q 2 region and the rest. Figures 19,20,21,22 show the normalized differential subjet cross sections in different regions of x. It should be noted that due to HERA kinematics, the regions in x and Q 2 are correlated to some extent. Figure 23 shows the data for all x regions plotted together. It is observed that the maximum of each measured normalized cross section in every region of x occurs in the same bin of the distribution, except for |\u03c6 sbj \u2212 \u03c6 jet | in the highest x region. Figure 24 shows the maximum 4 value of the measured normalized cross section for each observable as a function of x. The shape of the E sbj T /E jet T measured distribution does not change significantly with x, whereas some dependence is expected (see Fig. 24a). The dependence of the \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet and \u03b1 sbj distributions with x exhibits features similar to those observed in the study of the Q 2 dependence; in particular, the maximum values (see Figs. 24b and 24d) exhibit a monotonic increase as x increases, which is reasonably reproduced by the calculations. As discussed previously, these features are understood as a combination of two effects: a decrease of the predicted fraction of gluon-induced events from 44% for 0.004 < x < 0.009 to 6% for x > 0.093 and the change in shape of the normalized cross sections for quark-and gluoninduced processes as x increases (see Fig. 25).",

The most dramatic change is observed when restricting the kinematic region to 125 < Q 2 < 250 GeV 2 or 0.004 < x < 0.009 (see Figs. 12 to 15 and Figs. 19 to 22); the LO calculation of the \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet distribution does not exhibit a two-peak structure as seen in the NLO prediction and in the data (see Figs. 13 and 20). In addition, the LO calculation of the \u03b1 sbj distribution peaks at \u03b1 sbj \u223c \u03c0/2 in contrast with the NLO prediction and the data (see Figs. 15 and 22). This proves that the NLO QCD radiative corrections are responsible for these variations in shape and necessary for describing the data.        Predicted normalized differential subjet cross sections (solid histograms) for jets with E jet T > 14 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5 which have two subjets for y cut = 0.05 in the kinematic region given by Q 2 > 125 GeV 2 as functions of (a, c) \u03b7 sbj \u2212 \u03b7 jet and (b, d) \u03b1 sbj in different regions of x.
