Nine of these decay modes result in a single meson and single lepton in the final state (\u039b \u2192 m ) and conserve either the sum or the difference of baryon and lepton number (B \u00b1 L). The tenth decay mode (\u039b \u2192p\u03c0 + ) represents a difference in baryon number of two units and no difference in lepton number.

There are, however, features of our universe that are inconsistent with the SM framework. Astronomical observations suggest that our universe is dominated by matter over antimatter [4,5]. Sakharov proposed in 1967 that this asymmetry suggests fundamental interactions that violate CP-symmetry and baryon-number conservation [6]. The observed quark-sector CP violation, combined with baryon-number violating (BNV) processes that are allowed by the Standard Model, are insufficient [7] to account for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that there are yet-unobserved interactions that violate baryon-number conservation.",

            "text": "Baryon-number violating reactions are features of several theoretical extensions to the Standard Model, perhaps most notably the SU (5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of Georgi and Glashow [8], SU (5) being the larger gauge group in which the Standard Model's SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) are embedded [9]. The SU (5) theory proposes the existence of two new gauge bosons, the X and Y leptoquarks, so called because they allow vertices such as q \u2192 X , where q is a quark and a lepton. Other experiments have been performed to search for BNV processes in decays of the nucleon [10][11][12], \u03c4 leptons [13][14][15], top quarks [16], hadrons with bottom and charm quarks [17,18], and the Z boson [19], but no signal has yet been observed. The most stringent limits on such processes come from nucleon decays, and these have been used to constrain BNV decays in higher-generation (i.e., c, b, and t) quarks [20]. However, multiple amplitudes can contribute to a given decay process and these amplitudes can interfere either constructively or destructively, depending on their relative phases. The theoretical calculations that constrain these BNV processes do not take into account interference between the amplitudes due to the large parameter space. This allows for non-observation in one mode (e.g., decays involving the u or d quark) while still being consistent with observable BNV processes in some other mode (e.g., coupling to another quark flavor).",

The meson is either a \u03c0 \u00b1 or K \u00b1 and the lepton is either a e \u2213 or a \u00b5 \u2213 . We produced the \u039b by means of a photon beam incident on a liquid hydrogen target through the exclusive reaction \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u039b. For these eight modes we can completely reconstruct the three final state particles. We also searched for the decay of a \u039b to a K 0 S and a neutrino, which must be inferred from the missing momentum. Selection of these nine channels is motivated by searching for decay of the \u039b to a lighter pseudo-scalar meson. In each case the finalstate meson is included to preserve charge and angular momentum conservation. Thus, violation of L in these reactions is a consequence of B violation rather than a primary motivation.",

Though there is not a simple way to picture this reaction proceeding via X boson coupling, theoretical and experimental (e.g. [21,22]) work has been performed by other groups looking for similar oscillations of the neutron. Such baryon-antibaryon oscillations would have far-reaching implications and are often held up as evidence for high-energy theories ranging from see-saw models [23,24] to extra dimensions [25].

Fig. 3 shows that this distribution is exceptionally clean. We modeled these data with a third-order-polynomial for background processes and a double-Gaussian for signal processes. We then extracted the number of signal events by taking the excess of the data histogram above the background function in all of the histogram bins within 0.015 GeV/c 2 of the nominal \u039b mass, yielding N rec = 1.861 \u00d7 10 6 reconstructed \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 signal events.

The number of events in the signal region is much larger than is normally handled by the Feldman-Cousins approach; thus, we perform a likelihood scan to determine the upper limit on N UL .",

We found a 6.1% relative uncertainty in N prod by combining the 0.02% systematic uncertainty due to the IN V (p, \u03c0 \u2212 ) peak fitting procedure, the \u2248 6% systematic uncertainty in CLAS acceptance calculation (taken from previous hyperon production analysis [29]), and the 0.64% statistical uncertainty in p\u03c0 \u2212 (estimated with binomial statistics). We estimated the uncertainty in for each BNV channel by comparing the effects of optimized M M (K + ) and M M 2 cuts on MC and standard-model data distributions, and found it to be \u2248 7.6%. We combined all uncertainties in quadrature to find a relative uncertainty in B UL of \u2248 9.8%.

Though similar studies have been performed with much higher sensitivities for decays of the nucleon, this study offers the first direct probe of BNV processes involving strange quarks in the initial state. Using a dataset for photoproduction off of the proton collected with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory containing roughly 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 reconstructed Standard Model \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays, we have searched via blinded analysis for BNV decays of the \u039b to either meson-lepton pairs or top\u03c0 + . We found no BNV signal in any of the ten decay channels investigated, and set upper limits on branching fraction for each of the processes studied in the range 7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .",
