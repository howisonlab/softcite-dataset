Proton-proton collisions where provided by the LHC at center of mass energies of \u221a s = 7TeV in 2011 . CMS conducted several searches for BSM in finale states characterized by large missing transverse energy (E miss T ) and hadronic activity. On the one hand, the high E miss T signature occurs in models with weakly interacting particles that escape detection, which are favored by cosmological measurements. On the other hand, hadronic activity accours naturally in colored particle interactions dominating BSM cross sections in proton-proton collisions. In this article we focus on finale states containing a combination of two leptons, at least one of which is required to be a hadronically decaying tau (e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , or \u03c4 h \u03c4 h ). The charges of these two leptons can be either of same sign [1] or opposite sign [2], leading to different selection and background estimation strategies. The study concerning same and opposite sign finale are described in sections 3 and 4, respectively.",
