The dataset is \u223c78M TOF-triggered events taken from RHIC year 2008 runs. Through the measurement of e/\u03c0 ratio, we find that the photonic background electrons from \u03b3 conversions are reduced by about a factor of 10 compared with those in STAR previous runs due to the absence of inner tracking detectors and the supporting materials. The dramatic increase of signal-to-background ratio will allow us to improve the precision on extracting the charm cross-section via its semi-leptonic decays to electrons.",

Heavy-flavor quarks(charm and bottom) are produced dominantly through high-Q 2 partonic interactions [1]. Because of the large mass, it's expected that the cross-section of heavy flavor production can be calculated in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [2]. Precise measurements of charm total cross-section and transverse momentum spectrum in p+p collisions will provide a baseline to understand the charm production and in-medium mechanism in heavy ion collisions [3].",

Although the systematic uncertainties are quite large, the charm cross-section measured by STAR is different from that measured by PHENIX by a factor \u223c2 or 1.5\u03c3 [1,4]. STAR has large and uniform acceptance, but the material close to beam pipe in previous run is \u223c5.5% of a radiation length (X 0 ). In run8, STAR removed inner tracking detectors, SVT (Silicon Vertex Tracker) and SSD (Silicon Strip Detector). The material budget integrating from interaction point to TPC inner field cage is \u223c0.69%X 0 . There are wraps around the beam pipe to bake out the beam pipe and glues at inner field cage, which are estimated. The exact material in terms of radiation length is mapped from the data.",

In the analyses presented here, we'll focus on the e/\u03c0 ratio and compare the ratio from previous measurements and background. After selection of good runs and a vertex cut of |z vtx |<40cm to reject conversion background electrons from beam pipe and its support, we also need a rapidity cut -0.6<y<0 to ensure rapidity distribution of electron similar as that of pion when we calculate e/\u03c0 ratio.

We found the 2-Gaussian function cannot describe the left shoulder region of electron dE/dx due to the tail of the dE/dx from fast hadron in lower p T region(p T <1.6GeV/c). Instead, a function of exponential+Gaussian was used in the fit. We also use two methods to produce the background tail shape of fast hadrons and evaluate the uncertainty due to hadron contamination: 1)inverse velocity difference between measurement and calculation 0<1/\u03b2(measured)-1/\u03b2(\u03c0)<0.01 to provide pure pion dE/dx distribution; 2)energy deposited in EMC E<0.5GeV to enhance hadrons with non-electromagnetic showers. Figure 2 shows the dE/dx distribution together with a background distribution from method 1) in 0.5<p T <0.55(GeV/c). The exponential background tail can reproduce the background distribution very well.   In 1.6<p T <4.0(GeV/c), 3-Gaussian fit is used, assuming that one Gaussian function can describe kaons and some of the residual protons after the velocity cut. In order to check that we have a real electron signal, we used energy deposited in EMC to reject hadrons. Comparing the peak and width of electron with EMC and without EMC selection, we can evaluate the electron yields at high p T .",

(3)other background electrons from K e3 decays and dielectron decays of vector mesons. Photonic background 2) is much larger than other background, so we will use signed DCA (sDCA) (distance of closest approach of a track in TPC to the interaction point) to reject the electron background from gamma conversion at high radius and cocktail method to remove background from Dalitz decays of light mesons. Figure. 4 (a) shows radial distance (r) distribution of gamma decay vertex to the primary vertex from a GEANT simulation. There are two major background sources of gamma conversion, material around the beam pipe (Be beam pipe \u223c0.29%X 0 + wraps for the beam pipe bake-out) and TPC Inner Field Cage (IFC \u223c0.45%X 0 ). Here, we used sDCA cut to remove gamma conversion at high radius (<30cm). Figure.   shows the sDCA as a function of p T from run8 data. A hand calculation of where the sDCA should be from conversions at the IFC agrees nicely with the band in the data. sDCA = (p T /0.0015) 2 + r 2 \u2212 (p T /0.0015) where r is the \u03b3 conversion radius in a uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 0.5Tesla. We can use this expression to get the sDCA value of sDCA1 when r=30cm. With -0.5<sDCA<sDCA1 cut, we rejected electron from gamma conversion in the air with r>30cm, at IFC and TPC gas. After removing gamma conversion at high radius, we use cocktail method to subtract background from Dalitz decays. A cocktail of electron spectra from various background sources is calculated using a Monto Carlo event Generator of hadron decays. The most important background is the \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays. Through fit to the charge \u03c0 spectra in non-singly diffractive (NSD) p+p collisions, we get a function B/(1 + (m T \u2212m 0 )/nT ) n (in this expression, m T and m 0 stand for the particle transverse mass and rest mass separately and it has three parameters: B, n and T ). With fixed parameter n = 9.7, this expression fit not only charge \u03c0 spectra but also charge kaon, K \u22c6 , \u03c1 and \u03c6 well, so we use this expression as input to the generator. With cocktail method, we get the electron background from Dalitz decays of light mesons. Figure. 5 shows the e/\u03c0 ratio from run8 data, compared to various background cocktails, NPE from previous results, and run3 inclusive electron to pion ratio. We also check the consistence of the e/\u03c0 ratio from run8 and the results from run3. We take the material budget from which \u03b3 conversion in detector is \u223c10 in run3 than that in run8, and we include the e/\u03c0 from \u03c0 0 and e/\u03c0 from \u03b7 Dalitz decays from cocktail method and NPE/\u03c0 measured in run3 d+Au data scaled by the binary collisions together, then we find the total sum of e/\u03c0 from run8 is consistent with STAR TOF inclusive e/\u03c0 in run3, and the p T dependence can be well reproduced as well. In addition, \u03b3 conversion is equivalent to  Figure 5. (Color online)(a) e/\u03c0 ratio as a function of p T . The dashed line is the sum of various background e/\u03c0 ratio (\u03c0 0 /\u03c0, \u03b7/\u03c0 \u03b3/\u03c0 and NPE/\u03c0) for run3 with an estimate of material around the beam pipe to be a factor of x 10 higher than that in run8. (b) Full circles represent the inclusive e/\u03c0 ratio in run8 and the dashed line is similar as (a) by requiring 0.69%X 0 for gamma conversions.",
