With a mass roughly that of a tungsten atom, it is the only quark heavy enough to decay before forming bound states with other quarks. Its large mass has inspired numerous theoretical models in which the top quark plays a special role in the generation of mass or in the physics of new, undiscovered particles. The top quark often acts as either a direct contributor to new physics or an important background in new-particle searches in these models.",

At the Tevatron, where the top quark was discovered in 1995 [2,3], tt pairs are predominantly produced through quark-antiquark annihilation. In contrast, the tt production mechanism at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4] is expected to be dominated by the gluon fusion process. Measurements of the tt cross section at the LHC can provide important tests of our understanding of the top-quark production mechanism and can also be used in searches for new physics.",

The decay of a tt pair is categorized by the decay of the W bosons produced by the pair. Thus the channel in which both W bosons decay to leptons is referred to as the \"dilepton\" channel, and the channel in which one W decays to leptons and the other to quark jets is the \"lepton + jets\" channel. The channel in which both W bosons decay to jets is called the \"all hadronic\" channel. A further categorization of the decays is made by specifying the flavor of the charged lepton(s) produced from the W decays.

The amount of material before the ECAL in the CMS detector ranges from 0.4 to 1.6 radiation lengths, depending on \u03b7, and an electron may lose a considerable fraction of its energy through bremsstrahlung in passing through this material. The energy deposited in the calorimeter may be spread over a wide range in \u03c6 compared to the initial direction of the electron. To account for this in the reconstruction of electron candidates, clusters of calorimeter energy deposition (\"superclusters\") from a narrow fixed range in \u03b7 and a variable range in \u03c6 are formed. Starting from these superclusters, corresponding hits in at least two layers of the pixel tracker capable of acting as seeds for electron trajectory candidates are required. Energy loss through bremsstrahlung leads to non-Gaussian contributions to fluctuations in the calorimeter and tracking measurements. Therefore, the seeding and building of tracks is done using dedicated algorithms designed to handle these fluctuations. The final fit of the trajectories relies on a Gaussian sum filter that is a non-linear generalization of the Kalman filter with weighted sums of Gaussians instead of a single Gaussian.",

The trigger providing the data sample used in this analysis is based on the presence of at least one charged lepton, either an electron or a muon. Because the peak instantaneous luminosity increased throughout the data-taking period, the minimum transverse momentum p T of the muon required in the trigger ranged from 9 to 15 GeV, and the minimum E T required in the trigger for electrons similarly ranged from 10 to 22 GeV. This data sample is used for the selection of the signal region and the selection of signal-depleted control regions used for studies related to background processes. Trigger efficiencies are determined from the data using Z-boson events and then corrected for the differences in the efficiencies between the Z-boson events and tt events, using the simulated samples described below. Events are required to have at least one primary pp interaction vertex, where vertices are identified by applying an adaptive fit to clusters of reconstructed tracks [29]. The primary vertex must be within \u00b124 cm of the nominal interaction point in the direction along the proton beams.

The quoted uncertainties account for the limited number of simulated events, the uncertainty on the calculated cross section (where available), the uncertainties on the lepton selection and trigger efficiency correction factors, and a 4% uncertainty on the luminosity.

Predicted yields are calculated by multiplying selection efficiencies for each process, as determined from simulation, by the appropriate NLO or NNLO cross sections and the total integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 . As shown in Fig. 1, the fractional contribution to the event yield from tt signal events is negligible in events with zero jets, but dominates as jet multiplicity increases.

Because of this similarity and because of the very small number of expected single-topquark events, an unconstrained fit of the single-top-quark contribution is not possible. However, since the single-topquark production process is theoretically well understood, the number of such events can be estimated from simulations. Therefore the fit parameter for single top is not left to float freely, but is instead subject to a Gaussian constraint with a mean of 1.0 and width of 0.3. The uncertainty on this value is assigned according to the expected precision of initial single-top cross-section measurements in CMS [43]. In addition, the ratio between the W + jets and Z + jets cross sections is constrained to be within 30% of the expectation from theory, where the constraint width is set by the uncertainty in the NLO cross sections [44]. These constraints are inserted by multiplying the likelihood function used in the fit by Gaussian terms of mean value 1.0 and widths corresponding to the uncertainties on the respective constraints.

For this purpose pseudo-experiments are performed in which the number of events from the different processes are chosen randomly around the values predicted by simulations within appropriate uncertainties. Specifically this is done by randomly choosing, for each background process, an input value for \u03b2 k from a normal distribution with mean value 1.0 and a width of 30% for W+jets, Z+jets, and single top. Since the properties of QCD multijet events are more difficult to calculate, a more conservative uncertainty of 50% is used for this background. The templates for the different processes are then scaled with the corresponding \u03b2 k values and summed together, generating a pseudo-data distribution for E T in the three-jet sample and a pseudodata distribution for M3 in the inclusive four-jet sample. To simulate statistical fluctuations we then vary the contents of each bin of the two distributions using Poisson statistics. A maximum-likelihood fit to the templates is then performed on the distributions. This procedure yields one signal fit result \u03b2 fit tt for each pseudo-experiment and provides a measurement of any possible bias between the input and fitted values. We vary the input value \u03b2 in tt between 0.0 and 3.0 in steps of 0.2, and perform 50 000 pseudo-experiments for each value. Each set of pseudo-experiments gives a distribution of the fitted values \u03b2 fit tt . For each input value we determine the median and the 68% and 95% quantiles of the corresponding \u03b2 fit tt distribution and use these values for the estimation of the central values and for the construction of confidence belts, respectively. From this confidence-belt construction the tt cross section result corresponding to the \u03b2 fit tt measured in data can be extracted together with its total uncertainty.

These samples are insufficient for the simulation of data taken in late 2010, when the instantaneous luminosity was substantially higher than in early data-taking and roughly four to five additional collisions per bunch crossing were expected. In order to estimate the effect of these pileup collisions, which are present in data but not in our fit templates, additional samples of tt and W + jets events that included the simulation of these extra collisions were produced. Although the average number of pileup collisions in these samples is slightly larger than the expected number in data, these simulated events can still be used to provide a conservative estimation of the impact of pileup collisions on our measurement.",

The relative isolation is required to be between 0.2 and 0.5 for the sideband selection, in contrast to the nominal selection, where the muon must have a relative isolation smaller than 0.05. The gap between the allowed isolation ranges in the two selections reduces the signal events contribution to the sideband. Events containing muons with large relative-isolation values have different kinematics due to the correlation of the relative isolation with transverse momentum. We therefore restrict I rel to be smaller than 0.5. The QCD multijet purity as measured from simulation is 98.4% in the three-jet sample and 94.3% for events with four or more jets.

In the first method, we use a procedure based on counting the number of events with an isolated muon and four or more jets. This method uses an event selection slightly different from that described above. Specifically, the jet p T is required to be greater than 25 GeV instead of 30 GeV, and the muon is required to have relative isolation less than 0.1, compared to 0.05 in the nominal selection. Also the backgrounds from W/Z + jets and QCD multijet events are calculated by using the technique of Berends scaling [51]. In the second method, we measure the tt cross section using a simultaneous fit to the distributions of jet multiplicity (N jets ) and the muon transverse momentum, p T \u03bc . The jet multiplicity has been shown (Table 1) to be a powerful variable for separating top from QCD multijet and W + jets events. The variable p T \u03bc is an attractive choice because it is not directly affected by such systematics as the JES and JER uncertainties. Furthermore, because the muon in either W or tt production comes from a W decay, it receives a significant contribution to its momentum from the W rest mass, while muons from QCD multijet events receive no such boost. In the third method, the tt cross section is determined from a fit to the muon pseudorapidity distribution in order to separate the top signal from the W + jets and QCD multijet backgrounds. This analysis uses the asymmetry between inclusive W + boson and W \u2212 boson production, caused by the difference of the quark charges in the initialstate protons, to determine the templates for the W + jets background. A fourth method measures the tt cross section from events containing a high-p T isolated muon and at least three jets. For this analysis, we relax the relative isolation requirement to I rel < 0.1 but introduce a requirement that the E T in the event is greater than 20 GeV, in order to keep the amount of QCD multijet background small. A method based on Refs. [52, 53] is used to estimate the amount of QCD multijet background separately for events with three jets and events with at least four jets. The number of toppair and W + jets events is extracted from a fit to the M3 distribution. All four of these methods give results consistent with our previously quoted measurement, but with slightly larger combined statistical and systematic uncertainties in each case.",

The transition from a phase space dominated by W + jets events (in the 1-jet and 2-jet bins) towards a region dominated by the production of top-quark pairs (in the 4-jet bin) is clearly visible. The comparison of data and simulation indicates a good understanding of this transition, while the overall normalization seems to be slightly underestimated. This is consistent with the main analysis, which also found a W + jets cross section larger than the theoretical prediction. A measurement of the cross section for top-quark pair production in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV has been performed at the LHC with the CMS detector. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 and is based on the reconstruction of final states containing one isolated, high transverse-momentum muon or electron and hadronic jets. The measured cross section for the combined electron + jets and muon + jets channels is 173 +39 \u221232 (stat. + syst.) \u00b1 7 (lumi.) pb. This measurement agrees with but has a larger uncertainty than current theoretical values [10-12, 33, 34], which agree among themselves. For example, the approximate NNLO calculation from Ref. [12] yields 163 +7 \u22125 (scale) \u00b1 9 (PDF) pb, while a similar calculation performed using HATHOR [10,11] yields 160 +5 \u22129 (scale) \u00b1 9 (PDF) pb. For this calculation, Q 2 = (173 GeV) 2 is chosen for both the factorization and renormalization scales and the MSTW2008 NNLO [35] PDF set is used. The scale uncertainty is evaluated by independently varying the scales by factors of 4 and 0.25, and the PDF uncertainty is calculated using the 90% confidence level envelope of the PDF [10,11]. Our cross section measurement also agrees with the earlier CMS measurement in the dilepton channel [14] and the ATLAS measurement in the combined dilepton and lepton + jets channels [15], but has a smaller uncertainty than either of these previous results. Given the agreement between theory and the experimental measurements in both the dilepton and lepton + jets channels, no sign of new physics has emerged in these studies, and the top quark at the LHC remains consistent with being a very massive particle whose properties are as predicted by the standard model.
