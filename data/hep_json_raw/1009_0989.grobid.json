Each of the two experiments H1 and ZEUS collected roughly 0.5 fb \u22121 in fifteen years of running. At HERA, two kinematic regimes are distinguished, deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) with high photon virtualities, Q 2 \u2265 5 GeV 2 , and photoproduction (\u03b3p) with a quasi real photon, Q 2 0 GeV 2 , which is the dominating process. The large statistics of the HERA data allows detailed tests of perturbative QCD (pQCD) based on cross section measurements with jets or prompt photons. In DIS there are two relevant hard scales, Q and the transverse momentum P T of the jet or the photon, while in \u03b3p there is only P T . Jet measurements in DIS are carried out in the Breit frame. The k T cluster algorithm, which is collinear and infrared safe, is used to reconstruct jets.",

            "text": "In five recent analyses jet production was measured at HERA in various kinematic regions. ZEUS measured the inclusive jet cross section in \u03b3p [1] (Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 , P T, jet > 17 GeV ) and high Q 2 DIS [2] (Q 2 > 125 GeV 2 , P T, jet > 8 GeV). Both analyses provide a determination of \u03b1 s , furthermore the 2-jet cross section is measured for the high Q 2 [3] region (125 < Q 2 < 20000 GeV 2 , P T, jet > 8 GeV). Here the invariant mass of the two jets is required to be M j, j > 20 GeV. The 2-jet cross section has a high sensitivity to the gluon contribution of the PDFs in kinematic regions where its uncertainty is contributing significantly to the theoretical error. H1 measured inclusive, 2-jet and 3-jet cross sections as well as the ratio of the 2-jet to 3-jet cross sections for low [4] (5 < Q 2 < 100 GeV 2 , 5 < P T, jet < 80 GeV, M j, j > 18 GeV) and high Q 2 [5] (150 < Q 2 < 15000 GeV 2 , 7 < P T, jet < 50 GeV, M j, j > 16 GeV). For the latter the jet cross sections are normalised to the inclusive DIS cross section, which significantly reduces the experimental and theoretical errors. Fig. 1 shows the inclusive jet cross section as a function of the transverse energy of the jet for the ZEUS measurement in \u03b3p and high Q 2 DIS. For both kinematic regions the cross section falls steeply. The data are very precise, the dominant experimental error being the uncertainty of the energy scale of the jets, which is 1(3)% for jet energies above (below) 10 GeV. The measurement is compared to NLO QCD predictions which describe the measurement very well. The theoretical and experimental errors are of comparable size. The theoretical errors are dominated by the renormalisation scale uncertainty. Similar results are obtained for multijet cross sections. Overall the description by the NLO calculations is very good in all kinematic regions, though the low Q 2 analysis suffers from large theoretical uncertainties of up to 30%.",

Statistical, systematic and correlated uncertainties are taken into account. The dominant theory uncertainty is estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor 0.5 and 2. The running of \u03b1 s as a function of the renormalisation scale is shown in Fig. 2. The values are extracted from the H1 data at low and high Q 2 , similar results exist from ZEUS. In the low Q 2 region the values and experimental uncertainties are found to be in good agreement with the QCD expectation which is based on the extracted value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) of the high Q 2 measurement. Fig. 3 shows a summary of recent \u03b1 s measurements using jets at HERA together with the most precise determination of \u03b1 s from LEP [6] and from TEVATRON [7]. All measurements are in good agreement with each other in different kinematic regions (\u03b3p, low and high Q 2 ) and with the world average. Further measurements using different jet algorithms (anti-k T and SISCone [8]) lead to similar results. For many of the precise HERA results the theoretical uncertainties dominate the error. Higher order calculations are expected to improve the results. ",

Recent results have been published on prompt photon production in \u03b3p [9] for transverse energies of the photon 6 < E \u03b3 T < 15 GeV by H1 and in DIS [10] (4 < E \u03b3 T < 15 GeV) by ZEUS. Both experiments use the shower shapes of the electromagnetic cluster to discriminate the signal of single photons from multiple photons of decays of neutral hadrons. As already observed in previous publications, the new results show that the available calculations are not able to describe all the measured distributions well. In photoproduction it is found that the NLO calculations underestimate the inclusive prompt photon cross section, while there is reasonable agreement for events with a prompt photon and a jet. However, their transverse correlation, which is sensitive to higher order processes, is not well described. In DIS the cross section receives contributions from radiation off the elec-tron (LL) and also off the quark (QQ). The differential cross section as a function of Q 2 is shown in Fig. 4. The order \u03b1 3 QCD prediction (GGP) significantly underestimates the data at low Q 2 . Also included in the figure is the prediction of MRST for the LL part of the cross section. This calculation is based on QED contributions to the PDFs which increases the LL contribution. MRST together with the QQ contribution from GGP shows similar deficits at low Q 2 . ",

Fig. 7c illustrates that the original asymmetry observed on quark level is not visible anymore on hadron level at low x p . At high x p there is an overshoot of positively charged particles reflecting the charge asymmetry of the proton. The asymmetry is reproduced by various models.
