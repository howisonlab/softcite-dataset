This is because Standard Model CP violation in the D meson system is very small O(10 \u22123 ). Therefore even a small enhancement in CP asymmetry will be due to new physics. Any enhancement comes from loop-level contributions from non-Standard Model particles or interactions. Here we present the preliminary branching fraction (B) and CP asymmetry (A CP ) results for D 0 \u2192 V\u03b3 (V = \u03c6, K * 0 , \u03c1 0 ) decay and the measurements of branching fraction (B) of D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay with the Belle data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 943 fb \u22121 and 832 fb \u22121 , respectively.",

This is because of the contributions from the chromomagnetic dipole operators [1], [2] that can enhance A CP from the expected value of zero. So far no A CP measurements have been reported for this mode. The previous B measurements [3], [4] of D 0 \u2192 V\u03b3 mode are shown in Table 1. With the 943 fb \u22121 Belle data set, which is very much larger than the one used in the previous measurements, we expect to get a more precise measurement of B for this decay channel.

The signal component is shown by dotted red line. The signal yield obtained from the fits are: 524 \u00b1 35 for \u03c6 mode, 9104 \u00b1 396 for K * 0 mode and 500 \u00b1 85 for \u03c1 0 mode, respectively. Thus the raw asymmetries are \u22120.091 \u00b1 0.066 (stat), \u22120.002 \u00b1 0.020 (stat), 0.056 \u00b1 0.151 (stat) for \u03c6, K * 0 and \u03c1 0 modes, respectively. The control samples are analysed in the similar way as done earlier by the Belle collaboration [12]. The selection criteria are the same as in the signal modes and the signal extraction is performed via sideband subtraction method, where the signal (SW), lower (LW) and upper (UW) windows are defined in M D 0 . The efficiencies from the simulation is obtained as 22.7%, 27.0% and 21.4% for K + K \u2212 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 samples respectively. The extracted signal yields are 362,274 for K + K \u2212 mode, 4.02 \u00d7 10 6 for K \u2212 \u03c0 + mode and 127,683 for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode. The raw asymmetries are (2.2 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7 10 \u22123 for K + K \u2212 mode, (1.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22123 for K \u2212 \u03c0 + mode and (8.1 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10 \u22123 for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode.",

The systematic effect from the variable q is due to its low resolution in the signal mode compared to the control sample mode.

A systematic uncertainty is assigned to the fit procedure where the fixed parameters are varied with respect to their errors. The biggest difference between the so obtained B and A CP and the mean value is taken as the systematic error. An uncertainty is assigned to the dominant backgrounds of \u03c0 0 type for the chosen width of the smearing, varying the width by \u00b11 MeV/c 2 . For the normalization mode systematics, the procedure is repeated with different sidebands, \u00b125 MeV/c 2 for M D 0 . The statistical error on the fraction f , which is the fraction of background events in the signal window compared to all events in the sideband, is also taken into account. The difference between the data and simulation could also affect f , so a similar procedure for the calibration of the \u03c0 0 background is also performed. A systematic uncertainty is assigned for the case when f is obtained from simulation smeared by a Gaussian of width 1.6 MeV.",
