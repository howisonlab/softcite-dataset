The absence of any known internal structure provides for precision experiments to test fundamental physics theories and to determine accurate values of fundamental constants. In particular groun dstate hyperfine structure transitions can be measured by microwave spectroscopy to deliver the muon magnetic moment. The frequency of the 1s-2s transition in the hydrogen-like atom can be determined with laser spectroscopy to obtain the muon mass. With such measurements fundamental physical interactions, in particular Quantum Electrodynamics, can also be tested at highest precision. The results are important input parameters for experiments on the muon magnetic anomaly. The simplicity of the atom enables further precise experiments, such as a search for muonium-antimuonium conversion for testing charged lepton number conservation and searches for possible antigravity of muons and dark matter.",

            "text": "Muonium (M = (\u00b5 + e \u2212 )) has been discovered by Hughes and collaborators in 1960, [1][2][3] some 26 years after the first muon had appeared in a Wilson cloud chamber. 4 M consists of two leptons from two different particle generations. The particles are bound by the electromagnetic force. The positive muon (\u00b5 + ) is an antiparticle from the second generation. The electron (e \u2212 ) is the lightest charged lepton and from the first generation. Leptons are not directly subject to the strong force and they are point-like, i.e., to the best of our knowledge they have no inner structure and all their known structure arises from well calculable virtual fields in their vicinity. 5 The lifetime \u03c4 M of the exotic atom is essentially given by the free muon lifetime \u03c4 \u00b5 . 6 With the presently achievable precision they differ insignificantly by relative \u2248 6 \u2022 10 \u221210 , which is due to time dilation in the bound state. 7 The lifetime, \u03c4 M = \u03c4 \u00b5 = 2.196 980 3(2 2) \u00b5s ,",

For a number of such precision experiments on M the intense \u00b5 + beams at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), Tokai, Japan, have opened new and important possibilities for which the community has been waiting. [10][11][12] Refined precision experiments on M and muonic atoms are needed in particular, because of the puzzling results reported from muonic hydrogen (\u00b5 \u2212 H) spectroscopy, [13][14][15] where the extracted value for the proton charge radius differs from values obtained by electron scattering.

The \u00b5 + thermalize in the foil, diffuse to the surface, and leave the solid surface after capturing an e \u2212 from the solid. 63 This method has found applications in producing slow muon beams by photoionization of M. [64][65][66][67] (iv) M in vacuum is formed, if \u00b5 + are stopped near the surface of a SiO 2 fluffy powder target. 68 The M atoms diffuse to the surface and leave it with thermal velocities. For the atoms in vacuum a significant polarization of 39(9) % has been found, 69 which agrees with the expected maximum fraction of 50 % according to eq. 19. The fluffiness of the powder is essential and the production targets appear to loose efficiency on a timescale of approximately one week. This is simmilar to the time scale that was found for H 2 O molecules leaving the SiO 2 targets after they are placed into a vacuum chamber. 70 For typical \u00b5 + beam momentum bite \u2206p/p = 5 % typical average yields of up to 2-5 % have been achieved in precision experiments. 71 For this the targets had to be replaced twice a week. 33 SiO 2 powder targets have been employed for a number of precision experiments on M, including searches for MM conversion 33,72 and laser spectroscopic measurements of \u2206\u03bd 1s2s . [73][74][75][76] (v) M atoms have been produced in SiO 2 aerogel targets. 71 A fraction of the atoms has been observed to leave the SiO 2 aerogel into the surrounding vacuum, if the stopping of the \u00b5 + beam occurs close to the target surface. The yield of M in vacuum has been found to increase for an increased area of the SiO 2 target surface. 71,77 Recently research on this topic has been intensified. A significantly enhanced fraction of M that leaves the sample has been reported for low density SiO 2 aerogels. For these samples the surface had been enhanced by drilling holes with depth comparable to the width of the \u00b5 + stopping distribution and their separation and diameter of order M diffusion distance within \u03c4 \u00b5 . [78][79][80][81] A yield of 38(4)% was found for mesoporous silica 78 , which is one order of magnitude above the yields achieved for SiO 2 powder targets.",

The latest and most accurate results were achieved by the Yale-Heidelberg-Syracuse collaboration at LAMPF. The experiment used the technique of old muonium. 31 For this the atoms were produced with a pulsed \u00b5 + beam and signals were recorded from M atoms that had lived and coherently interacted with an rf-field driving the HFS transitions significantly longer than the free muon lifetime \u03c4 \u00b5 + . This results in a resonance lineshape with a central feature that is narrower than the natural linewidth \u03b4\u03bd HFS ,nat = 1/(2\u03c0 \u2022 \u03c4 \u00b5 + ) = 144kHz. 85 This feature provides for a better determination of the line center.  In order to obtain a time structure suited for an old muonium experiment the cw surface \u00b5 + beam at LAMPF was chopped using an electrostatic deflector. The time structure is shown in Fig. 3. The beam had an average particle rate of some 10 7 \u00b5 + /s with close to 100 % po-larization and \u2206p/p = 10% momentum bite. It was stopped in a Kr gas target to produce M. The O 2 contamination in the target was minimized and kept below 5 ppm by circulating the gas constantly through a purifying system. The gas temperature was kept stable to 0.1 \u2022 C and its pressure was measured to 0.5 mbar. Data taking took place at p 1 =800 mbar and p 2 =1500 mbar. The lowest possible pressure was determined by the stopping distribution inside the microwave cavity and had been chosen to keep the fraction of muons stopping in the walls of the cavity low.",

Note, in the regime, where two-body collision dominate, deviations from mostly linear behaviour have been observed for, e.g. atomic H, and hyperfine decoupling could be established at p < 1 mbar. 95 At J-PARC a new experiment to measure \u2206\u03bd HFS and \u00b5 \u00b5 is in progress. 93,94 It uses a concept similar the latest LAMPF experiment, however, with significantly improved technology. In particular, a new and intense beam line 96 will be employed. The microwave cavity will have an extended length to reduce \u00b5 + stopping in the cavity walls and to enable measurements at lower gas pressures. New B field calibration by proton NMR will be used and 3 He based field calibration is considered. The project is well underway and aims for gaining one order of magnitude over the latest measurement. A new directly measured value for \u00b5 \u00b5 is urgently needed. The new experiments to measure a \u00b5 require such a value which is independent of elaborate QED theory and which has not been extracted from \u2206\u03bd HFS . Note, here QED theory is exploited to extract \u00b5 \u00b5 , the theory which is stringently tested by a \u00b5 . At an intense pulsed \u00b5 + source and with modern decay positron tracing, the Doppler effect could be significantly reduced, in particular, if the experiment were conducted with the old muonium technique. Since studies for pressure shifts are obsolete, an experiment on \u2206\u03bd HFS in vacuum requires less \u00b5 + from a beam than experiments which use \u00b5 + stopping in a gas.  6.

For neutral kaons K 0 K 0 oscillations are a well established reality in the hadron sector. In the lep-ton sector the process involving the leptons e \u2212 and \u00b5 + , which correspond to the quarks in K 0 and K 0 , has not been observed, yet. The last experiment 33 was statistics limited by the available \u00b5 + flux. For a new experiment 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity is within reach through exploiting the time evolution of the MM conversion process (Fig. 7). For this, at a pulsed \u00b5 + source the ratio of the potential M signal to \u00b5 + and M decay related background could be significantly reduced, in particular if a N-fold coincidence signal signature is employed. In this case the muon related background is expected to drop exponentially with a time constant \u03c4 \u00b5 /N = \u03bb \u22121 \u00b5 /N . 82 A clear status assignment matter or antimatter is not obvious for the M atom.
