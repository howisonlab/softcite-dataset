We extend the reanalysis of pion production data in deuterium bubble chambers where this discrepancy is solved (Wilkinson et al., PRD 90, 112017 2014)  to include the \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + channels, and use the resulting data to fit the parameters of the GENIE pion production model. We find a set of parameters that can describe the bubble chamber data better than the GENIE default parameters, and provide updated central values and reduced uncertainties for use in neutrino oscillation and cross section analyses which use the GENIE model. We find that GENIE's non-resonant background prediction has to be significantly reduced to fit the data, which may help to explain the recent discrepancies between simulation and data observed by the MINER\u03bdA coherent pion and NO\u03bdA oscillation analyses.",

            "text": "Complete models of neutrino-nucleus single pion production interactions are usually factorized into three parts: the neutrino-nucleon cross section; additional nuclear effects which affect the initial interaction; and the \"final state interactions\" (FSI) of hadrons exiting the nucleus. Experimental data on nuclear targets presents a confusing picture, with a e-mail: callum.wilkinson@lhep.unibe.ch recent data from the MINER\u03bdA [1,2] and MiniBooNE [3] experiments in poor agreement with each other in the framework of current theoretical models [4,5]. An additional problem is the disagreement between measurements of the neutrino-nucleon single pion production cross section in the 100 MeV to few-GeV energy range most relevant for current and planned neutrino oscillation experiments. The axial form factor for pion production on free nucleons cannot be constrained by electron scattering data, so it relies upon data from Argonne National Laboratory's 12 ft bubble chamber (ANL) and Brookhaven National Laboratory's 7 ft bubble chamber (BNL). However, these datasets differ in normalization by 30-40 % for the leading pion production process \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + , which leads to large uncertainties in the predictions for oscillation experiments [6][7][8][9][10][11], as well as in the interpretation of data taken on nuclear targets [12].",

            "text": "It has long been suspected that the discrepancy between ANL and BNL was due to an issue with the normalization of the flux prediction from one or both experiments, 1 and it has been shown by other authors that their published results are consistent within the experimental uncertainties provided [6,16]. In Ref. [17], we presented a method for removing flux normalization uncertainties from the ANL and BNL \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + measurements by taking ratios with charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) event rates in which the normalization cancels. Then we obtained a measurement of \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + by multiplying the ratio by an independent measurement of CCQE (which is well known for nucleon targets). Using this technique, we found good agreement between the ANL and BNL \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + datasets. In this work, we extend that method to include the subdominant \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + channels, and we use the resulting data, along with the Q 2 -spectra (where Q 2 is the four-momentum transfer) from the same experiments, to constrain the parameters of the GENIE single pion production model [18]. While more sophisticated single pion production models exist [19][20][21], the GENIE generator is widely used by current and planned neutrino oscillation experiments, so tuning the generator parameters represents a pragmatic approach to improving its description of available data. We find that the reanalyzed data, where the normalization discrepancy has been resolved, is able to significantly reduce the uncertainties on the pion production parameters. We also find that the non-resonant background prediction from GENIE needs to be significantly reduced to fit the data.",

The FNAL data on a hydrogen target is selected with an invariant mass cut of W \u2264 1.4 GeV, in order to isolate the ++ contribution to the cross section, which also cuts out any diffractive contributions from the cross section [27].

As the CCQE events used in the correction are common to all channels, statistical errors are correlated in a way which is difficult to quantify. An example of the problem can be seen by looking at the three ANL channels for 1.0 \u2264 E \u03bd \u2264 1.1 GeV where an upward fluctuation of the CCQE event rate leads to a decrease in the reanalyzed cross section. It should be noted that this problem is also present in the published ANL cross section results because they used the measured CCQE event rate to correct their flux prediction. This problem is not dealt with in the fits presented in this work, we simply use the statistical errors from the reanalysis without considering correlations, but it will lead to an increase in the \u03c7 2 of the fits (because the \u03c7 2 penalty for a large statistical fluctuation is applied three times rather than once). The published and extracted ANL and BNL data are compared with other measurements of the three pion production channels [26][27][28][29]. All data is on hydrogen and deuterium targets, except for SKAT 1989 data which was taken on heavy freon (CF 3 Br). Note that both published and reanalyzed ANL and BNL data shown here have no invariant mass cut in the event selection, whereas the other datasets have an invariant mass cut of W \u2264 2GeV applied unless otherwise mentioned  ",

[18] and does not change significantly between the GENIE major versions 2.6.X and 2.8.X (X denotes the minor version number) investigated in this study. 2   default (and in this study). No in-medium modifications to resonances are considered, and interferences between resonances are neglected in the calculation. By default, the resonances decay isotropically in their center of mass frame. In general, there is an additional contribution to single pion production from coherent pion production processes, which are modeled (by default) in GENIE using the Rein-Sehgal coherent model [33] with lepton mass corrections included [34]. However, for the ANL and BNL channels considered here, the selection criteria include requirements on the struck or spectator nucleon, which effectively excludes coherent pion production as the deuterium is no longer bound in the final state. As such, coherent contributions to single pion production are not considered further in this work. 3 The original Rein-Sehgal model in Ref. [31] includes non-resonant single pion production as an additional resonance amplitude, while in GENIE the non-resonant component is implemented as an extension of the deep inelastic scattering model. The non-resonant (DIS) contribution to the GENIE single pion production model is calculated using the Bodek-Yang parametrization [36], with other relevant parameters described in detail in Ref. [18]. Hadronization is described by the AKGY model [37], which uses KNO scaling [38] for invariant masses of W \u2264 2.3 GeV, and PYTHIA [39] for invariant masses of W \u2264 3.0 GeV, with a smooth transition in between. The low-W KNO model is tuned to data from the Fermilab 15-foot bubble chamber experiment [40], and the high-W PYTHIA model is tuned to BEBC data [41]. We note that retuning of the PYTHIA model has been discussed elsewhere [42], although is not considered here as it affects larger W values than are relevant for this study.",

The default FSI model for both versions of GENIE is the hA intranuclear cascade model [18], which is tuned to \u03c0 + - 56 Fe and p- 56 Fe data, then extrapolated to other targets based on A 2/3 scaling (where A is the atomic number). In GENIE v2.6.X, FSI effects are negligible for deuterium, but the hA model was retuned for GENIE v2.8.X [43], which leads the deuterium FSI to reduce the total cross section predictions for all channels relevant for this work by 20-30 %. In this work we have ignored this difference and make the assumption that interactions on deuterium can be treated as interactions on quasi-free nucleons which are only loosely bound together, and so neglect FSI effects. Low-Q 2 bins (Q 2 < 0.1 GeV 2 ) are not included in the fit to avoid the region where FSI effects are expected to have a significant effect in deuterium. We note that in Ref. [44] a careful study of FSI effects for pion production interactions on deuterium was carried out. This work found that interactions between the final state nucleons significantly modifies the cross section for the \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + channels, the most notable feature being a suppression of the cross section for very forward pions. A more careful treatment of FSI based on the work presented in Ref. [44] would be an improvement to future iterations of this work, but the calculation does not currently predict the entire final state of the interaction so is not ready to be implemented in a generator.",

The GENIE prediction for the Q 2 distributions is normalized separately for ANL and BNL such that the total prediction is equal to the measured rate summed over all three channels. The Q 2 predictions shown are therefore shape-only, but with the relative normalization between the different pion production channels preserved. 5 All data considered have no invariant mass cuts applied and the event selection in GENIE is based on the particles produced at the initial interaction vertex, not those surviving GENIE's FSI model as previously discussed. In Figs. 2 and 3, the GENIE prediction is also shown broken down into resonant (RES) and non-resonant (DIS) contributions. Additionally, the dominant contribution to the RES component is shown separately for reference. The total GENIE prediction is the incoherent sum of the RES and DIS contributions, where interference terms have been neglected. On each plot the 1\u03c3 error band produced by combining the nominal GENIE uncertainties on M RES A , RES normalization, and DIS normalization is also shown for comparison.

Indeed, the Q 2 -dependent and E \u03bd -dependent distributions for each channel and experiment agree reasonably well with each other. When these four datasets are excluded, the pvalue returned at the best fit point is more reasonable (\u223c0.02), indicating that the poor quality of fit seen in Fig. 8 can be mostly attributed to these four datasets. As there is no reason to suspect that these datasets are biasing the fit, we prefer to leave these datasets in the fit and present the fit with all 12 datasets included as the main result of this work.

The large normalization discrepancy between them has led to large uncertainties in pion production parameters, which presents a problem for meeting the stringent error budgets required by current and future oscillation analyses. In this work, we use the reanalyzed ANL and BNL \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + datasets from Ref. [17], where this normalization discrepancy has been solved, to constrain the GENIE single pion production model parameters. The reanalysis method from Ref. [17] is applied to the subdominant pion production channels \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + , and Q 2 -dependent distributions for all three channels for both ANL and BNL are also used in the fits. Although the GENIE single pion model is not state of the art, it is widely used by many currently running experiments, so improvements to the parametrization are of interest to the community. Additionally, the fits described here provide a blueprint for their use in constraining other models.  Fig. 9 The global dataset (described in Sect. 2) is compared with the best fit result and post-fit uncertainties for the GENIE v2.8.2 (RES) fit, for the three single pion production channels investigated in this work. Note that the reanalyzed ANL and BNL data shown have no invariant mass cut in the event selection, whereas the other datasets have an invariant mass cut of W \u2264 2 GeV applied unless otherwise mentioned. An invariant mass cut of W \u2264 2 GeV has been applied to the GENIE prediction for this comparison",

We also note that the recent NO\u03bdA results [53] found a discrepancy between the hadronic energy distribution observed at the near detector and their GENIE simulation. There were more events in data where the hadronic system had less recoil, and fewer with high recoil, compared to the GENIE prediction. Although the discrepancy is treated as calibration effect in the NO\u03bdA analysis, it is more likely to be due to deficiencies in the GENIE cross section model. The retuned pion set of production parameters described in this work will ameliorate the NO\u03bdA discrepancy because it reduces the non-resonant pion production component, which will contribute events where the recoiling hadronic system has a lot of energy.",

Recent proposals to extract neutrino-proton pion production cross sections from experiments where the target material contains hydrogen [54] raise the possibility of new data, which will further reduce the parameter uncertainties. For ANL, the raw event rates are digitized from Refs. [55] (partial dataset) and [24] (full dataset) and are summarized in Table 4. The CCQE event rates are only given using a partial dataset using \u223c30 % of the final ANL exposure, whereas the single pion production event rates use the full ANL dataset. The dominant pion production channel \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + was also given in Ref. [55] using the partial exposure, so the ratio of partial to full events in this channel can be used to scale the CCQE event rate to the full statistics. The final fully corrected ANL event rates for the single production channels are shown in Fig. 10a. Note that the event rates given for the partial dataset are already corrected for detector effects and backgrounds. For the full dataset, the distributions are given without detector corrections applied, but the total corrected event rate is given, so the corrected event rate can simply be obtained by scaling the raw distribution (detector corrections as a function of E \u03bd were not considered in the ANL analysis). Note also that the ANL data is mostly from a deuterium fill of the detector, but data is also included from an initial hydrogen fill of the detector, which makes up approximately 2 % (6 %) of the full (partial) dataset. This issue only affects the \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + channel (as all other channels here are on a neutron), and is discussed in Ref. [17].",

            "text": "Using the corrected event rates in Fig. 10, and the corresponding distribution for CCQE (shown in Ref. [17]), it is possible to form ratios of \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + over CCQE, as shown in Fig. 11. Finally, corrected cross sections for these subdominant pion production channels can be obtained by multiplying the ratio by the known CCQE cross section, to produce the final cross sections given in Fig. 12 and used in this work. This procedure has already been applied to the \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + channel in Ref. [17], so is not shown here. Details of the GENIE CCQE cross section  Fig. 10 The digitized event rates on deuterium for the three interaction channels \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + , \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + , as a function of the reconstructed neutrino energy E \u03bd . The errors are statistical only. Both ANL and BNL event rates and errors have been scaled when necessary to the statistics of their full deuterium samples  Tables 4 and 5), the agreement between the total digitized event rate and published event rate agrees within 1 %. We assume that the effect of digitization on the shape of the event  Fig. 11 The ratio of \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + events to CCQE events as a function of E \u03bd for both ANL and BNL rate distributions is small, and therefore neglect digitization uncertainties in this work, as in Ref. [17]. Only statistical errors are shown for the reanalyzed datasets, which are the dominant source of uncertainty for low-statistics bubble chamber data. Flux normalization uncertainties are the second largest source of uncertainty in the original ANL and BNL analyses, at around 15-20 %. These uncertainties are not considered here because they cancel (by construction) when taking ratios. However, we note that we have replaced the flux uncertainty with the uncertainty in the \u03bd \u03bc -D 2 CCQE cross section, where the dominant uncertainty is the axial mass, M A , which can be considered to be \u223c2 % normalization error on the E \u03bd distributions [57,58].",

This uncertainty is therefore more significant for the subdominant channels \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + than the dominant \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + channel, but for all cases, the energy smearing is E \u03bd E \u03bd \u2264 5 %. There are additional uncertainties for all channels which come from the detector corrections and background subtractions which are discussed for ANL in Refs. [24,55] and for BNL in Refs. [25,56]. These corrections are given on the total rate only, so no information is available from either experiment on how they may distort the shape of the E \u03bd distributions. For the overconstrained CCQE and \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + channels, these are mostly corrections for reconstruction and scanning inefficiencies, with small background corrections. A conservative estimate on the normalization uncertainty for the overconstrained channels is \u223c5 %. For the \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + channels, which are not kinematically overconstrained, the normalization uncertainty from the quoted correction factors are \u223c10-15 % for both experiments. There are significantly more backgrounds for the underconstrained channels, which makes the reanalysis of these channels more dependent on the ANL and BNL calculations than the dominant \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + channel. These backgrounds are from the misreconstructed CCQE and \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 + events, multipion events with unobserved final state particles and migration between the \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + selections. In this analysis we neglect the normalization uncertainty from detector effects for the \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and \u03bd \u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c0 + GeV with and without the correction described in the text channels for simplicity. Although the \u223c10-15 % value is no longer negligible compared with the statistical errors, applying a fully correlated normalization error of this size would not change the results of this analysis significantly and still rests on the rather simplistic assumption that all of the detector effects and backgrounds have no E \u03bd dependence (although this assumption is present for the published ANL and BNL cross sections measurements for these channels). We note that the size of this neglected normalization error is smaller than the flux uncertainties which are canceled in this analysis.",
