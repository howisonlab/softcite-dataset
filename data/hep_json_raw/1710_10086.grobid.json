The value of the CP -even fraction F + is determined to be 0.238 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b1 0.012. The strong-phase differences are also measured in different regions of K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 phase space by binning around the intermediate resonances present. The potential sensitivity of the results for determining the CKM angle \u03b3 from B \u00b1 \u2192 D(K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )K \u00b1 decays is also discussed.",

The current uncertainty on \u03b3 is significantly larger than that of the Standard Model (SM) prediction, which is calculated from the assumption of unitarity and measurements of other parameters in the CKM matrix [3]. This is due to the small branching fraction of decays sensitive to \u03b3. A more precise measurement of \u03b3 is crucial for testing the SM description of CP violation and probing for new physics effects. The data collected at detectors such as BABAR, Belle, LHCb or the future Belle II experiment can be used to determine \u03b3. The D decay final states so far studied include those that are either CP -eigenstates, flavour specific or self-conjugate. The statistical uncertainty on \u03b3 can be reduced if information from additional D meson final states is included, which in practice means new three and four-body decay modes. However, the use of multibody final states requires knowledge of the strong-phase difference between the D 0 andD 0 that varies over the phase space. Determining the fractional CP content of the D meson final state is also helpful. The required information can be obtained by studying quantum-correlated DD mesons produced in e + e \u2212 collisions at an energy corresponding to the mass of the \u03c8(3770).",

The study is made with data collected by the CLEO-c detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.82 fb \u22121 . We determine the CP -even fraction F + of the decay which makes it potentially useful in a quasi-GLW [4,5] analysis along with other CP eigenstates [6]. Furthermore, this multibody self-conjugate decay occurs via many intermediate resonances, such as K 0 S \u03c9 and K * \u00b1 \u03c1 \u2213 , hence if the strong-phase difference variation over the phase space is known, a GGSZ-style [7,8] analysis to determine \u03b3 from this final state alone is possible. Hence measurements of the relative strong-phase are performed in localised regions of phase space. A similar study has already been performed for a four-body D decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [9].",

This corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.82 fb \u22121 . A detailed description of the CLEO-c detector is given in refs. [13][14][15][16]. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of signal events are used to estimate selection efficiencies. Generic samples of DD MC events having twenty times the integrated luminosity of the data set are used to determine the background contributions. The EvtGen [17] package is used to generate the decays and the detector response is modelled with Geant [18]. The final-state radiation effects associated with charged particles are simulated with PHOTOS [19]. One of the D mesons is reconstructed in the final state of interest, K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and the other to one of the different tag states given in table 1. All tracks and showers associated with both the D mesons are reconstructed; the selection criteria for the tag modes are identical to those presented in ref. [6].",

The bins are exclusive and the cuts are applied sequentially in the order of the bin number. We also note that increasing the number of bins, which would result in better sensitivity to \u03b3, led to instabilities in the fit due to the large number of null bins. MC studies led to robust results for the nine bins. We do not use K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 or K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 as flavour tags because the corrections from the Cabibbo-favoured and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes cannot be calculated in the absence of an amplitude model for D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . Due to the finite resolution of the detector, reconstructed decays may migrate to other bins in phase space. This effect is studied by looking at simulated signal events and a 9 \u00d7 9 migration matrix M , is calculated. Each of its elements gives the ratio of the number of events reconstructed to those generated in a bin. There is a significant loss of 20% from bin 1 due to the \u03c9 resonance having a narrow decay width. The double-tagged yields (Y ) for each mode are corrected for the migration effects as Y i = \u03a3 j M ij Y j , where i and j run from 1 to 9. The K i andK i values given in table 6 are also obtained after the correction applied as sensitivity only to c i values. The tags K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K 0 L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 give sensitivity to both c i and s i values. The already measured strong-phase parameters for D \u2192 K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are used as inputs in the fit. As the binning scheme for the signal mode is not symmetric, it is no longer possible to exploit the symmetry of the tagging decay. Therefore, there are sixteen bins in the tag-side and nine bins in the signal-side. The sample of doubly-tagged K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events is also useful in providing information on s i values. For such events, there are nine bins each in the signal and tag side.",

The Belle sample of B \u00b1 \u2192 D(K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K \u00b1 [26] has \u2248 1200 events.

The decay phase space is five-dimensional, hence there is no trivial symmetry to define the bins as in the case for three-body decays. Furthermore, a proper optimization is impossible due to the lack of an amplitude model. Therefore, the bins are constructed around the most significant intermediate resonances present in the decay. A nine-bin scheme is defined around the intermediate resonances such as the \u03c9, K * and \u03c1. The kinematic regions of the bins are given in table 6 along with the fractions of flavour-tagged",

Systematic uncertainties Several sources of systematic uncertainty are considered in the c i and s i determination. The fitter assumptions are tested using pseudo experiments. The yields are calculated for a given set of c i and s i values and they are fitted back to see the deviations in the result from the input values. The input values are given within the physically allowed region of c 2 i + s 2 i \u2264 1. The yields in each bin are multiplied by a factor of 100, and 400 such experiments are performed. This is to avoid bias due to statistical fluctuations in certain bins where the c i values are unphysical. The mean of the pull distribution multiplied by the statistical uncertainty on the nominal value is taken as the systematic uncertainty due to a possible bias in the fit assumptions. The negative and positive deviations from the nominal value are summed in quadrature. The background events are fluctuated to +1\u03c3 and \u22121\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the statistical uncertainty, and the fits are run to obtain c i and s i values. The difference from the nominal values are taken as the systematic uncertainty.

This can be achieved by harnessing new D decay modes for the measurements of CP asymmetries in B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 . We present the first measurement of the CP -even fraction F + for the decay D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 which gives F + = 0.238 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b1 0.012. The F + measurement can be used in a quasi-GLW analysis in which there is no binning of the D \u2192 K S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 phase space, although this does not provide single-mode sensitivity to \u03b3. In addition, the measurements of amplitude weighted averages of the cosine and sine of the strong-phase difference between D 0 andD 0 decaying to the self-conjugate final state of K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 have been performed. This is done in nine regions of the decay phase space binned according to the intermediate resonances present. These results allow a model-independent GGSZ estimation of \u03b3 from this mode alone. It is estimated that a single-mode uncertainty on \u03b3 of \u03c3 \u03b3 = 4.4 \u2022 is achievable with a 50 ab \u22121 sample of data at Belle II experiment. This could be improved",
