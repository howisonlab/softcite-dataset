The results are obtained using the full Run II data sample collected with the Collider Detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb \u22121 . The cross section is measured as a function of photon transverse energy, E \u03b3 T , in the range 30 < E \u03b3 T < 500 GeV and in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.0. The results are compared with predictions from parton-shower Monte Carlo models at leading order in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The latter show good agreement with the measured cross section. ",

It has a cylindrical geometry with approximate forward-backward and azimuthal symmetry. It includes a charged-particle tracking system consisting of silicon microstrip detectors and a cylindrical open-cell drift chamber, designed to measure charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and momenta. The tracking system is contained within a 1.4 T axial magnetic field. It is surrounded by electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters segmented in projective towers and used to identify and measure the energy and position of photons, electrons, hadrons, and clusters of particles (jets). The central calorimeters cover the region |\u03b7| < 1.1, and have electromagnetic transverseenergy resolution of \u03c3(E T )/E T = 13.5%/ E T (GeV) \u2295 1.5% and a tower segmentation of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 0.1\u00d715 \u2022 in pseudorapidity-angular space [7]. At a depth corresponding approximately to the maximum energy density in the development of a typical EM shower, the EM calorimeters contain detectors that measure the transverse shower profile. The electromagnetic compartments of the calorimeter are equipped with a timing system measuring the arrival time of particles that deposit energy in each tower [24]. Drift chambers and scintillation counters located outside the calorimeters identify muons.",

Since there can be multiple collisions in the same bunch crossing, the event primary vertex (pp interaction point) is chosen to be the one that results in the best balance of the p T of the photon; the z position of the reconstructed primary vertex is required to be within 60 cm of the center of the detector. The photon transverse energy is corrected to account for nonuniformities in the calorimeter response, and calibrated using electrons from reconstructed Z-boson decays [27]. Photon candidates are required to satisfy E \u03b3 T > 30 GeV and to meet requirements on calorimeter isolation [28], on track isolation [28], and on the ratio of the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter to the energy in the EM cluster [25].

This track is allowed to account for underlying event and pile-up energy around the cluster. The number of electrons coming from W -boson decays is further reduced by requiring the missing transverse energy [7] of the event to be less than 80% of the transverse energy of the photon candidate. This requirement also reduces backgrounds arising from other sources that lead to energy imbalance, such as muons from cosmic rays that may emit bremsstrahlung radiation in the calorimeter, and muons from beam-halo interactions with the beam pipe, which may in turn interact with the detector material producing photons. Finally, the EM signal timing is required to be consistent with the pp collision time [25].

            "text": "After the event selection, the remaining background comes from the decays of hadrons (such as \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3); they cannot be rejected on an event-by-event basis, so a statistical background-subtraction technique is used to measure the signal cross section. To evaluate the sig-nal fraction, an artificial neural network (ANN) is defined using as input the shower-shape, transverse profile, and isolation variables [36]. The inclusive-photon simulation is matched to data by applying the same corrections as derived in Refs. [13,37]. Further, MC events are reweighted to the observed instantaneous luminosity profile to account for luminosity-dependent effects. The expected ANN output distributions (\"templates\") for signal and background samples are constructed using pythia inclusive-photon and dijet MC predictions, respectively. These templates are validated using the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and dijet data samples [37]. To estimate the prompt-photon rate, the ANN output distribution observed in data is fit to a linear combination of signal and background ANN templates, using a binned maximumlikelihood method that accounts for uncertainties on both data and templates [38]. A fit is performed in each E \u03b3 T bin, yielding prompt-photon fractions in the E \u03b3 T range from 30 GeV up to 500 GeV, as shown in Fig. 1 for an example E \u03b3 T bin. Figure 2 shows the resulting signal frac- tion (photon purity) as a function of E \u03b3 T . The systematic uncertainty on the signal fraction is estimated by varying the fit configurations (i.e., different binning and different fitting method [45]), and the values of the ANN input variables within their uncertainties. The dominant uncertainty on the shape of the ANN templates originates from the modeling of calorimeter isolation energy. The overall systematic uncertainty on the signal fraction is estimated to be 8% at low E \u03b3 T , 6% at high E \u03b3 T , and 3% on average for the intermediate E \u03b3 T range 40 < E \u03b3 T < 300 GeV.

The factor A \u00d7 combines corrections for acceptance, resolution effects and efficiencies for selecting and reconstructing the photon to infer the results at the particle level (i.e., generator level). The correction is computed from the bin-by-bin fraction of simulated particle-level prompt photons in the reconstructed signal events, as determined by the pythia MC calculation. The numerator is obtained by applying the same requirements to the pythia-simulated events as those applied to data. The denominator is obtained by selecting generated particles [39] in the fiducial region, with E \u03b3 T > 30 GeV and the same energy isolation requirement as in the data. The photon efficiency is calibrated by comparing the selection efficiencies for Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events in data and in simulation [37].

The pythia prediction underestimates the observed cross section by more than a factor of 1.5 across the whole E \u03b3 T range. This is possibly due to the lack of higher-order terms in the pythia photon+jet matrix-elements. The sherpa calculation is approximately 1.1 to 1.2 times larger than the observed cross section, nearly uniformly across the E \u03b3 T range. This calculation includes up to three jet emissions associated with the observed photon, but it is missing virtual corrections in the matrix elements of the subprocesses, which could possibly explain the discrepancy with data. Other possible reasons are related to nonperturbative QCD processes, such as mistuned fragmentation subprocesses leading to excessive rates of photon production through fragmentation.",
