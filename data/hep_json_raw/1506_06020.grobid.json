The search uses 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the background-only hypothesis based on the Standard Model expectation. In the context of a Type-I seesaw mechanism, limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for production of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the mass range between 100 and 500 GeV. The limits are subsequently interpreted as limits on the mixing between the heavy Majorana neutrinos and the Standard Model neutrinos. In the context of a left-right symmetric model, limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set with respect to the masses of heavy Majorana neutrinos and heavy gauge bosons W R and Z .",

In this regime, the production and subsequent decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos could lead to a final state containing exactly two charged leptons, where the leptons may have the same or opposite charge in equal fractions of the heavy neutrino decays. Only lepton pairs of the same charge (same-sign) are considered as there is a smaller expected SM background for pairs of same-sign leptons than for pairs of leptons of opposite charge (opposite-sign). The search includes the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 final states. The search is guided by two theoretical models. In the first model, the SM is extended in the simplest way to include right-handed neutrinos [8], such that light neutrino masses are generated by a Type-I seesaw mechanism or by radiative corrections [9]. In this minimal Type-I seesaw mechanism (mTISM), the heavy Majorana neutrinos, N , can be produced via an off-shell W boson, pp \u2192 (W \u00b1 ) * \u2192 \u00b1 N . Due to previous limits [10,11], the heavy neutrino is assumed to be more massive than the W boson and therefore subsequently decays to an on-shell W boson and a lepton. The on-shell W boson produced in the decay of the heavy neutrino predominantly decays into a quark-antiquark (qq) pair. The final state in this case contains two opposite-sign or same-sign leptons and at least two high-p T jets, where p T is the transverse momentum with respect to the beam direction. 1 The tree-level process is illustrated in figure 1.

Furthermore, the energy scales of the two models are largely separate. The energy scale of mTISM final states is set by the heavy neutrino mass, which, based on the LEP constraints [10,11], is assumed to be greater than 100 GeV. Instead, the energy scale of LRSM final states is set by the masses of the heavy bosons, which, motivated by the earlier heavy neutrino searches, are assumed to be greater than 400 GeV.

Additional LAr calorimeters with copper and tungsten absorbers cover the forward region. The MS consists of dedicated trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4 and precision tracking detectors covering |\u03b7| < 2.7. A system of three superconducting toroids (one in the barrel, two in the end-caps), with eight coils each, provides the magnetic field for the MS. A three-level trigger system is used to collect the data. The first-level trigger (L1) is implemented in hardware, using a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to no more than 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels (L2 and EF), which together further reduce the event rate to less than 1 kHz.",

It is assumed in the model that the coupling between heavy gauge bosons and the heavy neutrino is equal to the coupling between the respective SM gauge bosons and light neutrinos. Similarly, the couplings of the new gauge bosons and the quarks are assumed to be equal to the couplings between the SM gauge bosons and the quarks. In the Pythia implementation of this process, all of the decay products of heavy neutrinos are distributed isotropically and so the heavy neutrino decays are independent of m W R , with the assumption that m W R > m N . In this approximation, the decay of the Z boson is also independent of m W R . The events are generated with W R boson masses between 0.6 TeV and 4.5 TeV and Z boson masses between 0.4 TeV and 3.6 TeV. At each Z and W R mass point, the heavy neutrino mass is varied upward from 50 GeV to at most 100 GeV below the mass of the heavy gauge boson. At each mass point, a sample is generated assuming no mixing between the heavy neutrinos, which results in final states containing same-flavour leptons {ee, \u00b5\u00b5, \u03c4 \u03c4 }.",

The uncertainty on the jet energy scale is notably asymmetric in the mTISM signal region (table 2) compared to the LRSM signal region (table 3) due to the dependency on the leading dijet mass in the mTISM signal region definition described in section 4.4. The uncertainty due to the JES on the sum of the prompt and charge-flip backgrounds varies from 6 \u2212 28%, depending on the signal region. The modelling of the missing transverse momentum ('E miss T ') [46] is included as a systematic uncertainty in the mTISM signal region (table 2) as there is a dependence on this quantity in the signal region definition described in section 4.4. Other smaller systematic uncertainties include the uncertainty on the the jet energy resolution [47], the jet vertex fraction requirement, uncertainties on lepton identification efficiencies, energy / momentum scales and resolutions ('Lepton uncertainties') [35,36] and the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement ('Luminosity') [48]. In addition to the uncertainties associated with the MC simulation of background processes, there are systematic modelling uncertainties associated with the signal MC samples. An uncertainty is considered for the signal MC simulation to reflect the choice of parton shower model. The nominal parton shower model that is used for all signal MC samples is Pythia 8.165. The total number of events in the signal region when the signal MC generator is interfaced to Pythia is compared to the number of events when the generator is interfaced to Herwig 6.520. The variation in the signal efficiency is measured to be approximately 5%. The uncertainty due to the parton distribution functions on the signal acceptance is found to be approximately 5% for the mTISM signal samples and approximately 7% for the LRSM signal samples.",

            "text": "The LRSM signal is expected to produce a peak in the invariant mass of the decay products of the heavy gauge boson. This would be observed in the invariant mass distribution m j(j) (m jj(jj) ) in the W R (Z ) signal regions, as described in section 4. The observed and predicted distributions are shown in figures 9 and 10. Binned likelihood fits are performed to the invariant mass distributions and the profile-likelihood test statistic is used to assess the compatibility of the data with the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses. No significant excess is observed in the data compared to the background expectation and 95% CL upper limits on the cross-section of the production of heavy gauge bosons decaying to heavy neutrinos within the LRSM are set using the CL s method. The expected and observed cross-section exclusion limits as a function of the masses of the heavy gauge bosons and heavy neutrino are shown for example mass points for both channels, ee  figure 11. The contours are found by comparing the cross-section limits to the leading-order cross-sections for the signal processes and no uncertainties are included on the signal crosssections. For this interpretation there is assumed to be no mixing between lepton flavours and three cases are investigated: the first two cases assume a single heavy neutrino being kinematically accessible and being of either electron or muon flavour, which leads to events expected in one of the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels, respectively. The limits are stronger in the \u00b5\u00b5 channel at low heavy neutrino mass, due to the higher signal acceptance discussed in section 4.5. As the efficiency of the LRSM signal is low in the ee channel for m V R m N , the limit in this region is weaker. Finally the case where two degenerate neutrinos are present is investigated, leading to events expected in both the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels. The expected limits for this scenario are slightly stronger than either of the individual channel scenarios. The sharp changes in the expected and observed limits visible in figure 11 originate from the interpolation between the limited number of mass points for which the limits are extracted.",

The selected events contain two same-sign charged leptons and high-p T jets. Two final selection criteria were used to provide sensitivity to two different benchmark models, the first being a minimal extension of the SM, mTISM, and the second being a left-right symmetric extension of the SM, LRSM. The background expectation in the signal regions is estimated using a combination of data-driven methods and MC simulation.",
