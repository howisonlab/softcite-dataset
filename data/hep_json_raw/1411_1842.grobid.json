The asymmetry ACP allows comparison between the mixing probabilities P(B 0 \u2192 B 0 ) and P(B 0 \u2192 B 0 ), and therefore probes CP and T violation. The result, ACP = (\u22123.9 \u00b1 3.5(stat.) \u00b1 1.9(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , is consistent with the Standard Model expectation.",

A difference between the probabilities P(B 0 \u2192 B 0 ) and P(B 0 \u2192 B 0 ) is allowed by the Standard Model (SM), and is a signature of violations of both CP and T symmetries. This type of CP violation, called CP violation in mixing, was first observed in the neutral kaon system [1], but has not been observed in the neutral B system, where the SM predicts an asymmetry of the order of 10 \u22124 [2]. The current experimental average of CP asymmetry in mixing measured in the B 0 system alone is A CP = (+2.3 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [3], dominated by the BABAR [4,5], D\u00d8 [6], and Belle [7] experiments. The most recent LHCb result A CP = (\u22120.2 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [8] had not been included in the aforementioned average. A recent measurement in a mixture of B 0 and B 0 s mesons by the D\u00d8 collaboration deviates from the SM expectation by more than three standard deviations [9]. Improving the experimental precision is crucial for understanding the source of this apparent discrepancy.",

The dilepton signal probability distributions of the classifiers are shown in Fig. 1. We select events with a probability > 0.7 to minimize the statistical uncertainty based on fits to the BB MC sample. The final on-peak data sample includes 2.5% continuum background for all dilepton samples, and 35% (8%) BB background in the same-sign (opposite-sign) sample. Approximately 0.1% (3%) of selected electrons (muons) in dilepton samples are misidentified. According to the simulation, nearly 98% of the misidentified electrons come from pions and 87% (12%) of the misidentified muons come from pions (kaons). To correct for the difference in the muon misidentification rates between data and MC samples, we study the muon identification efficiency in clean kaon and pion control samples from the process D * + \u2192 D 0 (\u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + (and the chargeconjugate process). The ratios of the efficiencies between data and MC samples are used to scale the misidentified muon component in the MC sample. The corrections to \u00b5 + (\u00b5 \u2212 ) is 0.792 \u00b1 0.012 (0.797 \u00b1 0.013). Since the misidentification rate is very low for electrons, we use a much larger pion control sample from K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. This control sample has a lower momentum spectrum and does not cover the region of p > 2.5 GeV in the laboratory frame, which accounts for less than 8% of the misidentified leptons. The corrections to misidentified e + (e \u2212 ) is 1.00\u00b10.10 (0.56\u00b10.10). The quoted uncertainties are conservative estimates that result from mismatched momentum spectra and from a small fraction of kaons and protons among misidentified electrons.",

(Color online) Measurements of CP asymmetry in neutral B mixing, including this measurement (red square), recent LHCb result [8] (teal rhombus), Refs. [4-7] (B 0 ; green triangles), Refs. [21, 22] (B 0 s ; blue dots), and Ref. [9] (B 0 , B 0 s mixture; magenta contour). The vertical band is the average of Refs. [4-7] and several other older measurements (not shown). The horizontal band is the average of Refs. [21, 22]. The average \"HFAG Spring '14\" [3] (excluding LHCb [8] and this result) is also shown (orange contour). institutions wish to thank SLAC for its support and kind hospitality.
