The search is based on an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and at least two jets, where the two leading jets are each tagged as originating from c quarks. Events containing isolated electrons or muons are vetoed. In an R-parity-conserving minimal supersymmetric scenario in which a single scalar-charm state is kinematically accessible, and where it decays exclusively into a charm quark and a neutralino, 95% confidence-level upper limits are obtained in the scalar-charm-neutralino mass plane such that, for neutralino masses below 200 GeV, scalar-charm masses up to 490 GeV are excluded.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] is a theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) and naturally resolves the hierarchy problem by introducing supersymmetric partners of the known bosons and fermions. In the framework of a generic R-parity-conserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM, the MSSM [10][11][12][13][14], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, providing a possible candidate for dark matter. In a large variety of models, the LSP is the lightest neutralino,\u03c7 0 1 . The scalar partners (squarks) of various flavors of quarks may, rather generally, have different masses despite constraints on quark flavor mixing [15]. Recent searches disfavor low-mass top squarks (stops), sbottoms, and gluinos, so direct scalar-charm (c) pair production could be the only squark production process accessible at the LHC. Searches forc states provide not only a possible supersymmetry discovery mode but also the potential to probe the flavor structure of the underlying theory.",

Events are required to have a reconstructed primary vertex consistent with the beam positions, and to meet basic quality criteria that suppress detector noise and noncollision backgrounds [22]. Jets are reconstructed from three-dimensional topological calorimeter energy clusters by using the anti-k t jet algorithm [23,24] with a radius parameter of 0.4. The measured jet energy is corrected for inhomogeneities and for the noncompensating response of the calorimeter by using p T -and \u03b7-dependent [25] correction factors [26]. The impact of multiple overlapping pp interactions (pileup) is accounted for using a technique, based on jet areas, that provides an event-by-event and jet-by-jet correction [27].

The selected events have large E miss T and two c-tagged jets. The results are in agreement with SM predictions for backgrounds and translate into 95% C.L. upper limits on scalar-charm and neutralino masses in a simplified model with a single accessiblec state for which the exclusive decayc \u2192 c \u00fe\u03c7 0 1 is assumed. For neutralino masses below 200 GeV, scalarcharm masses up to 490 GeV are excluded, significantly extending previous limits.  165a,165b,b L. Adamczyk, 38a D. L. Adams, 25 J. Adelman, 108 S.
