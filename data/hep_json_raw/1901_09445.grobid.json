            "text": "Neutrinos were assumed to be massless particles until the discovery of neutrino oscillation process. This phenomenon indicates that the neutrinos have non-zero masses and the mass eigenstates (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 ) are mixing of their flavour eigenstates (\u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u03c4 ). The oscillations between different flavour eigenstates are described by three mixing angles (\u03b8 12 , \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 ), two differences of the square of neutrino masses (\u2206m 2 21 , \u2206m 2 31 ) and a charge conjugation parity symmetry (CP) violating phase \u03b4 CP . The Double Chooz (DC) experiment, located near the Chooz Electricit\u00e9 de France reactors, France, measures the oscillation parameter \u03b8 13 using reactor neutrinos. In this paper, DC reports its latest \u03b8 13 result, sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) = 0.105 \u00b1 0.014, exploiting its multidetector configuration, iso-flux baseline, reactor-off data and a novel total neutron capture detection technique. Since \u03b8 13 was the last unknown mixing angle, which is necessary to measure \u03b4 CP , the result has contributed to the completion of a quest of the neutrino oscillation studies lasting half a century and to pave way toward the CP violation measurement. In addition, DC provides the most precise measurement of the reactor neutrino flux to date, given by the mean cross section per fission \u03c3 f = (5.71 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission.",

            "text": "The first experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations and, still, most of the information today relies on high precision disappearance measurements with about 50 years of history. The establishment of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon [1,2,3] came as a solution of atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies around the year 2000. Those results had indicated two consequences: a new oscillation mode, labelled \u03b8 13 , and the possibility to observe CP-violation, if \u03b8 13 was sizeable. The reactor neutrino experiments CHOOZ [4] and Palo Verde [5] set upper limit of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.15 already before 2001. The Double Chooz (DC) group was formed in 2006 to measure the \u03b8 13 more precisely making use of near and far detector configuration [6]. The DC experiment has played a pioneering role in this oscillation channel by providing the first positive evidence, in 2011 [7], in combination with the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance results of T2K [8] and MINOS [9] experiments. The establishment of \u03b8 13 awaited the Daya Bay experiment's observation in 2012 [10]; confirmed soon after by the RENO experiment [11]. Today's world best value [12] is driven by the statistical combination of the latest published \u03b8 13 results [13,14,15,16,17]. A reassuring feature for the field is that all reactor \u03b8 13 experiments are redundant which is critical to ensure a robust and unambiguous result. Therefore, multi-experimental validation framework is highly beneficial. A working group formed by all three experiments is on-going with the goal to assess both internal consistency and coherent systematics treatment of each experiment.",

However, their ability for a high precision measurement of \u03b8 13 is limited by uncertainties and unknowns such as the \u03b4 CP and \u03b8 23 octant degeneracy. Conversely, this channel allows them to explore neutrino oscillation CP-violation directly. Currently, the beam experiments provide the first CP-violation explorations [18,19] by using the value of \u03b8 13 from reactor experiments as input. The latest data allow beam experiments to obtain the first hints of nonzero \u03b4 CP .

Most of the systematic uncertainties are cancelled out by using functionally identical detectors observing the same reactor \u03bd e sources. DC can provide clean analysis results by using several unprecedented techniques such as the exploitation of the effective iso-flux site geometry which cancels possible difference between the two reactors, a model-independent background estimation via reactor power modulation including reactor-off data and the total neutron capture detection technique which significantly increases the neutrino event statistics. Those analysis details are also explained. In addition, the DC near detector is used to characterise the rate and shape difference between data and predicted spectra, and measure the most precise neutrino flux to date, given by the mean cross-section per fission \u03c3 f .

Both rate and shape flux uncertainties are treated via covariance matrices as predicted by the datadriven reactor flux model [26,27,29] used by DC. The Bugey4 experiment (B4) provides an independent rate constraint via its \u03c3 f and therefore extra precision via the cancellation of the common spectrum terms. The uncertainty coming from the reactor-detector baselines is negligible (< 0.01%). The unknown inter-reactor correlations are assumed to be correlated for the reactor power (P th ) and the fission fractions (\u03b1 f ) in the SD case and uncorrelated for any MD configuration in general (combined uncertainty of P th and \u03b1 f is 0.83%). These assumptions are made to minimise the \u03b8 13 sensitivity to be conservative. In the DC case with two reactors the uncertainties on P th and \u03b1 f are reduced by about a factor of \u221a 2. Only the uncorrelated terms are relevant for the specific MD case in DC (ND/FD-I and ND/FD-II).",

Thus, TnC combines past Gd-only [13] and H-only [14] selections. The main challenge is the control of larger BGs. The IBD space-time coincidence definition relies on a multi-variable ANN (Artificial Neural Network) thus rejecting random (uncorrelated) BG coincidences -see Appendix for details. More than two orders of magnitude of accidental background rejection is possible while keeping high the average selection efficiency at 86.78 \u00b1 0.21% (MC: 86.75\u00b10.01%) and at 85.47\u00b10.08% (MC: 85.54\u00b10.02%) averaged over the prompt energy spectra of the FD and ND, respectively. The selection efficiency is defined as the inclusive ratio of IBD candidates with the standard and loose ANN cuts. Thus, the denominator integrates over \u223c98% of the detectable IBD's.

            "text": "The novel TnC has several remarkable features. Mainly, the TnC integrates all n-capture elements, thus the\u03bd e detection is independent from specific capture details. This implies that the detection volume expands to both the GdT (Gd-target) and GC (gamma-catcher), as shown in Fig. 1, so the TnC volume increases \u223c3\u00d7 as compared to Gd-only. This boost in statistics 2 is critical for the DC sensitivity. In addition, the statistical limitation of the selection systematics is reduced as the selection efficiency per volume increases close to 100% in GdT and \u223c80% in GC due to the ANN accidental rejection. The wider TnC acceptance integrates over most MC inaccuracies, including the complex spill-in/out effect across the GdT-to-GC boundary. The only relevant boundary is the simpler GC-to-buffer with only H-C on both sides. So, TnC matches MC better while all element-dependent terms, such as Gd or H fractions, are irrelevant. A small concentration of Gd was found inside the GC of the ND due to leakage from the GdT. The described element independence also makes the TnC leak insensitive demonstrating selection stability within 0.1% in both the ND and FD.  All detection systematics are summarised in Table 2 for both SD and the ideal MD case with ND and FD taking data simultaneously. The \u03b8 13 uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on the number of protons in the target/detection volume (or \"proton-number\"). The higher GC proton-number uncertainty (1.1%) as compared to the GdT (\u223c0.3%) is because at the time of the filling of the detectors we did not consider that precise IBD detection in the GC was possible. The selection systematics estimation uses an IBD data-driven inclusive approach. Thus, the estimator simultaneously integrates and averages over a) IBD spectrum and volume, b) ANN selection correlations and dependences, c) energy scale systematics including uniformity, stability and linearity and d) any correlation among all the above terms. The robustness of the IBD-based methodology was demonstrated with two methods using independent data: one was based on 252 Cf data sampling in the GdT [13] while the other was based on fast-neutrons data in both the ND and FD over the full volume. No deviations of more than 1\u03c3 (respectively 0.1% and 0.3%) were observed. Lastly, the TnC selection was challenged to per mille precision by estimating the known 252 Cf neutron multiplicity [32]. Agreement across ND and FD is within 0.1% (1\u03c3). Thus, the uncertainty on the selection efficiency is demonstrated <0.3% (MD) and <0.4% (SD) excluding the dominant proton-number uncertainty. The proton-number will be re-evaluated with higher precision upon detector dismantling. In brief, the TnC technique provides a robust IBD detection framework with better selection systematics for both SD and MD physics.",

Due to the small overburden 3 , cosmogenic BGs are dominant: fastneutrons and unstable isotopes produced from 12 C spallation, such as 9 Li. The signature of fast-neutrons is a recoil on H, as prompt, followed by the n-capture, as delayed. One or more neutrons can participate in a fast-neutrons coincidence. 9 Li undergoes a \u03b2-n decay (including \u03b1's), but no indications of 8 He production are found [33]. Since the detector chimney is an effective tagging hole to vertical \u00b5's, there is a potential background when they stop inside the active detector volume. Both \u00b5 decay at rest (Michel e \u00b1 ) and \u00b5 capture have been carefully studied [34] and rejected to a negligible level. Lastly, the accidental BG is caused by two independent events, mainly from radioactive isotopes inside or around the detectors. An offline 1.25 ms veto is imposed after each tagged \u00b5, thus rejecting the resulting fast neutrons' captures (>5\u00d7\u03c4 capture ) and stopping-\u00b5's. The live time loss is 5.4% (FD) and 25.5% (ND). DC has developed a multi-veto method yielding large BG rejection: a rejection factor of 200 is reached for the FD and 35 for the ND as compared to simple time coincidence. The vetoes are defined identically across ND and FD. Cosmogenic BG rejection relies on direct \u00b5 and/or neutron tagging using ID (inner detector), IV (inner-veto) and OV (outerveto) detectors', as shown in Fig. 1.",

Fast-neutron rejection exploits direct neutron tagging in the IV or the primary \u00b5 using the OV. The ANN discards most accidentals with a rejection factor >300. Since IBD's extend to the GC, about 25% of external \u03b3's are tagged in the IV acting as anti-Compton veto. Stopped \u00b5's are fully suppressed based on Michel e \u00b1 discrimination using information of the ID pulse-shapes and goodness of fit information from the position reconstruction. Any veto using the ID only affects delayed triggers to prevent any prompt spectral distortion affecting \u03b8 13 . The IBD inefficiency for all vetoes combined is 4.5% (FD) and 5.7% (ND) with negligible (<0.05%) systematics. See Appendix for further complementary selection and veto details. Table 3 summarises the remaining BG estimates including several independent measurements employed to validate the accuracy. The BG rates, larger compared to Gd-only [13], have negligible impact on the determination of \u03b8 13 . The BG subtraction impact is small for signal-to-background >10 while the dominant statistical BG uncertainty is reduced. The vetoed BG samples provide copious data-driven spectra, which contain BG information independent of MC simulations. The shape of cosmogenic BG is found to be identical across ND and FD within statistical uncertainties. The non-flat energy spectrum of the fast neutrons was carefully evaluated as it could mimic the \u03b8 13 signature. Its spectra was characterised over an extended window up to 100 MeV. The overall impact of BG on \u03b8 13 is marginal. The dominant BG systematic is the 9 Li uncertainty. The BG model accuracy was scrutinised independently with \u223c17 days of inclusive 0-reactor data samples in both ND and FD-II. Thus, these data are not used in the \u03b8 13 fit. No non-statistical bias or tension (<1\u03c3) is found on the measured BG-model, rates and/or spectral shapes.",

The nominal fit considers the input from each SD fit (data to its MC) including pertinent constraints and correlations. The SD fit is shown in Fig. 3-(bottom). In our MD analysis, all SD fits (FD-I, FD-II and ND) are simultaneously performed, constrained by the inter-detector correlations such as BG (shape), detection (rate), energy (shape) and flux (rate+shape). Thus, the common ND provides direct and almost un-oscillated rate+shape reference spectrum. Systematic uncertainties cancel due to correlations with both FD-I and FD-II. The iso-flux FD-II benefits from the maximum error cancellation. The \u03b8 13 measurement is, in principle, independent from any common or correlated contributions across the MC and detectors. Fig. 4-(left) illustrates the inter-detector ratio fit exhibiting the expected \u03b8 13 flux modulation and demonstrating the suppression of the spectral distortion against the MC. The common MC serves both as link to the neutrino energy (E\u03bd e ) and an inter-detector comparison mediator. The non-trivial role of the reactor model is scrutinised later on. This is a delicate point since the data to prediction comparison exhibits clear distortions uncovered by the uncertainties such as the 5 MeV excess shown in Fig 3. The BG constraints benefit from \u223c8 days of FD-I 0-reactor data (taken in 2011 and 2012) and the 20 MeV range extension. The systematics are treated both via covariance matrices (energy and reactor flux) and nuisance pull terms. In the covariance treatment data points and uncertainty bands in figures do not fully represent the fit constraints upon minimisation. Pull terms are also used in the \u03c7 2 minimisation and give access to physical observables (BG rates, inter-detector normalisation, etc) as well as insight to the fit consistency. There is negligible (<1\u03c3) tension in all fit output values. The fit strategy follows an unbiasing scheme where performance and robustness to \u03b8 13 measurements are scrutinised using MC and fixed prior to the final data fit.",

The expected total uncertainty (i.e. sensitivity) was 0.014. The statistical precision is 0.005, so systematics largely dominate. The large \u03c7 2 /DoF is caused by the mismatch between data and prediction, which is not covered by the model uncertainties. This topic is addressed later on. The 9 Li rate is unconstrained in the fit. This is because the fit 9 Li sample is up to 50% statistically correlated to the one used for 9 Li estimation (\u00b5-to-IBD time correlation), as summarised in Table 3. The rate+shape spectral distortion is shown in Fig. 4 (right). An empirical fit to the spectral distortion residual appears to resolve a structure consistent with a slope and one or two Gaussian peaks. Their origin remains unknown. The common normalisation across all detectors can be measured as output of the fit. The value is 1.004 \u00b1 0.008, while the input value was constraint by the uncertainty of the Bugey4 measurement (1.4%) [23]. The sizeable smaller output uncertainty indicates that DC holds valuable independent information about rate normalisation. Table 4 summarises the contributions to the total uncertainty in the oscillation fit. The FD drives the overall statistical precision (\u223c90k IBD's). Because the FD-I data set still represents a large fraction of the data analysed here, the flux systematics are the largest contribution to the uncertainty on \u03b8 13 . However, the operation of the two detectors in isoflux configuration during FD-II lead to a large reduction of the systematics and this phase drives the overall sensitivity. The detection uncertainties are dominated by the large GC proton-number uncertainty. The BG has a small role, thanks to the statistics and since the 9 Li rate is constrained in the  to prediction ratio is shown (bottom). The best fit solution (blue) contrasts with the no-oscillation hypothesis (red). Two dominant spectral distortions can be appreciated: the \u03b813 signature (mainly FD) and a common 5 MeV excess, leading to a large \u03c7 2 /DoF of 182/112. Bugey4 constrains the prediction rate. The normalisation with this constraint is lower as compared to the prediction rate not using the Bugey4 information. The cancellation of both common distortions and correlated uncertainties takes place from the SD (yellow) to the MD (green) configurations. The covariances used (not shown) play an important role during the fit.",

Asimov data is used here to illustrate the spectral distortion impact on \u03b813 when considering a similar distortion as that found in data. Bugey4 is needed to correct the SD (black) rate normalisation. Else, an unbiased \u03b813 measurement is impossible, even if arbitrarily increasing the uncertainties. The SD \u03b813 value exhibits a strong dependence on the shape uncertainty of the reactor model due to the spectral distortion. Both SD and MD (blue) match to the input \u03b813 only when considering an increase of up to 4\u03c3 of this uncertainty. This increase provides an IBD-based empirical new prescription which yields a robust \u03b813 measurement in both bases. The extra uncertainty accommodates the otherwise unaccounted 5 MeV spectral excess. This is corroborated with data (see text). While this behaviour is specific to the \u03b813 signature, the main pattern remains: any shape-dependent SD result might be spurious due to the reactor model dependences. The \u03b813 from MD data is found to vary <1.0% thus demonstrating its better stability. The model uncertainty underestimation arises in the MD case mainly via the reported \u03c7 2 /DoF tension due to the ND statistical precision. This tension vanishes when similarly increasing the model uncertainty. sight comes from splitting the measurement into the rateonly (16% precision) and shape-only (43% precision) contributions. The main \u03b8 13 constraint is due to rate-only (systematics dominated). The shape-only information has enhanced significantly due to the higher statistics in the FD as compared to previous DC results [13]. No tension is found between rate and shape measurements (<0.5\u03c3). The shapeonly \u03b8 13 fit value is about 20% lower as compared to our main result whereas the rate-only fit is higher. This indicates shape effects as the observed spectral distortions do not introduce a bias towards a higher \u03b8 13 . The shape stability of the central value is seen by freeing the |\u2206m 2 ee | marginalisation: sin 2 2\u03b8 13 =0.104 +0.032 \u22120.019 and |\u2206m 2 ee | = (2.49 +0.40 \u22120.49 )\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 are obtained.

Thanks to the direct iso-flux monitoring, the reactor flux prediction of FD-II is largely correlated with the ND (\u223c 0.1% uncorrelated normalisation uncertainty), hence the precision on \u03b8 13 is much better as compared to FD-I. It is interesting to decompose the \u03b8 13 measurement into the statistically independent FD-I (22% precision) and FD-II (15% precision) samples. Indeed, FD-II drives the reported central value of \u03b8 13 . Using the SD, the FD-I and FD-II samples are demonstrated to be statistically consistent (\u223c0.7\u03c3). FD-II (46% of data) is expected to dominate future DC results.",

Beyond the better precision achieved, this implies that those measurements depended on the Bugey4 rate normalisation. In the MD case, the impact of Bugey4 cancels across both the ND and FD. The consistency of the ND normalisation can be experimentally tested via the measurement of \u03c3 f ; i.e. the mean cross-section per fission. The value of \u03c3 f is proportional to the reactor mean flux. So, the reactor luminosity can be used as an inter-experiment reference allowing comparison across experiments. This way, the ND normalisation can be validated against Bugey4 -the most precise measurement to date and reference to all past DC measurements. Fig. 7 shows the data to MC model ratio (R \u03c3 f ) for the most relevant published results so far and their corresponding \u03c3 f . The R \u03c3 f (ND) is in agreement within 1\u03c3, dominated by prediction uncertainty, with all other experiments, including the 2017 world average. The prediction normalisation used [38] allows easier comparability across experiments -see further details in the Appendix. Other normalisation estimations [39] are consistent within order 1%. The ND measurement of \u03c3 f = (5.71 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission is the most precise measurement to date. The \u03c3 f central values of Bugey4 and DC(ND) agree <0.5%, once corrected by the relative differences in average fuel composition. This was quantified by the overall DC \u03b8 13 fit normalisation output when using the Bugey4 constraint.",

This measurement pioneers the IBD Total Neutron Capture (TnC) detection technique with a major reduction of both SD (singledetector) and MD selection systematics and by a boost of statistics by a factor \u223c2.5\u00d7 relative to Gd-n selection. DC demonstrates the robustness of the quoted background, detection and energy systematics via the articulation of several independent measurements for each systematic. The external reactor flux model systematics are studied and shown to have negligible impact for the extraction of \u03b8 13 with the MD configuration. However, the SD \u03b8 13 extraction is more sensitive to the systematics of the predicted spectrum. An empirical model extension is introduced here with increased uncertainties for the reactor systematics. In this way an accurate SD \u03b8 13 measurement in very good agreement with the MD analysis is demonstrated. DC also reports here for the first time an empirical model of the distortion found between the measured and the predicted spectra. The observed structure of the empirical fit might shed light on the origin behind these deviations. DC also reports here the most precise mean crosssection per fission \u03c3 f = (5.71 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 to date, in good agreement with Bugey4 and others experiments. All the results presented here are expected to provide access to the best reactor-\u03b8 13 knowledge and related physics. The DC \u03b8 13 precision is expected to improve with more statistics and better systematics such as the proton-number. The R \u03c3 f ratio of \u03c3 f (mean cross-section per fission) for DC(ND), Bugey4 [23,38], DYB [38] and the 2017 world average [38] are shown. The DC shown results are \u03c3 f =5.71 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10 43 cm 2 /fission with a R \u03c3 f (ND)=0.925 \u00b1 0.002(stat.) \u00b1 0.010(exp) \u00b1 0.023(model) upon corrections, including the \u03b813 dependence for DC(ND) and DYB. The corresponding \u03c3 f are also quoted for DC, Bugey4 and DYB. DC ND supersedes Bugey4 as the most precise measurement to date, thanks to the good systematics control using the TnC selection. Rate normalisation agreement is found across all experiments, as indicated by a consistent R within uncertainties (black), dominated by the prediction error.",

This precision has led to among the most precise SD \u03b8 13 and \u03c3 f measurements to date. A key element for a high SD physics performance is the detector simulation accuracy.

Custommade front-end electronics ensure the pulse dynamics, including pre-amplification (gain \u223c10) and match the Flash-ADC specification for accurate sampling, thus minimising digitisation artefacts. A dedicated global self-trigger system [44] was used to identify IBD interactions using a combined and tuneable energy and multiplicity criterion. The readout energy threshold was kept low (\u223c0.3 MeV) thus having negligible impact on the relevant physics which starts well above 0.5 MeV. After each trigger, the deadtime-less DAQ causes 256 ns of Flash-ADC sampling to be read out, thus allowing for >150 ns of light scintillating pulse sampling. The Flash-ADC waveforms are reconstructed offline to infer time and charge information per channel yielding <1 ns time resolution and efficient pulse identification from signals with less than 1/5 of a photo-electron (PE). This information seeds the subsequent high-level event reconstruction stages such as vertex position, pulse shape, energy, etc. Further details on event reconstruction were covered in [13].

Fast-neutrons allow for tomographic maps of both H-n and Gd-n captures for leak positioning and time evolution characterisation. All observables compromised by the leak have been replaced in favour of leak-robust quantities, including the TnC detection technique strategy used for IBD detection, unlike the past n-Gd and n-H selections. There is no trace of any leak in the FD. The proton number uncertainty (NT: 0.3%, GC: 1.1%) is the dominant contributor to the signal normalisation uncertainty. The error on the GC proton number relies on all measurements available to date, and will be re-assessed with dedicated measurements during the detector dismantling. To calculate the proton-number, the absolute liquid mass and the relative H fraction in the scintillator need to be known. Whereas masses can be measured at the 0.1% level and below, the H fraction can be determined at the 1% level with standard technologies such as CHN elemental analysis. The Gd-scintillator was produced in one batch and is chemically identical for both detectors. Therefore the uncertainty on the mass ratio can be estimated purely from the weight measurements including temperature effects. The ND to FD proton-number ratio for the Gd-scintillator is 1.0042 \u00b1 0.0010. For the two GC volumes the masses are determined from the calculated volumes of the vessels and the measured liquid density. The dominant uncertainty for a SD is from the limited H fraction knowledge. However, a big fraction of this uncertainty is correlated among samples. The total ND to FD proton-number ratio in the GC including mass determinations and H fraction contributions is 1.0045 \u00b1 0.0067.",

            "text": "The selection starts by identifying \u00b5's using the \u00b5-tagging criterion such that the sample of singles excludes events just after \u00b5's. The after \u00b5's events -rich in cosmic neutron captures -are not used for IBD selection. However, those events are used for self-calibration and regular detector response and  capturing monitoring across the entire volume and detector live time. The IBD selection starts by imposing the IBD coincidence, in both time and space, between the prompt and the delayed neutron capture candidates. The ANN imposes the multi-dimensional prompt-delayed correlation trained to reject random coincidences; i.e. most of the accidental BG. Since the Gd sample has negligible accidental BG contribution (a few per months) [13], the ANN impact the contribution mainly from the GC volume affecting mainly the H sample [14]. The input variables are \u2206t prompt-delay , \u2206r prompt-delay and \u2206E delay . The first two variables exploit the fact that random coincidences exhibit, by definition, aleatory distributions. For example, the \u2206t prompt-delay is flat for random coincidences as opposed to correlated events which exhibit the characteristic neutron-capture time distribution. Instead, \u2206r prompt-delay grows with r 3 (saturating within the detector acceptance) for random coincidences, while correlated events are contained within about 1 m. Thus, the ANN mainly exploits these very different measured patterns between correlated and random coincidences to select correlated events, such as IBD's. The \u2206E delay has a minor impact since the TnC uses a wide range. There are few events below (<1.3 MeV) and hardly any event above (>10 MeV) the energy range considered. The ANN, however, eliminates signal candidates in the range [3.0,3.5] MeV, as illustrated in Fig. 2 where the signal to background ratio is expected to be low. The ANN training benefits from copious and clean samples for both signal and accidental BG. The ANN is expected to be immune to correlated coincidences, such as the IBDs and most cos-  (FD) and 2375 day \u22121 (ND), which imply a rejection factor of \u223c375 relative to singles. These numbers provide an absolute scale to the all other shown below. The \u2206r prompt-delay \u22641.2 m condition yields some important reduction. However, major accidental BG rejection is only obtained by the ANN with a \u223c400 rejection factor. After the ANN, the challenging correlated cosmogenic BG dominates the total BG rate, as expected due to the shallow overburden. The FD is better shielded. Extra rejection uses the cosmogenic vetoes. The overall rejection factors are \u223c193 (FD) and \u223c34 (ND) relative to the loose coincidence.",

The signal relies on the IBD MC demonstrating an excellent agreement with data in both input and output variables over the full dynamics considered.The ANN optimisation criteria discussion is illustrated in Fig. 8. Here, the challenge is matching data to MC for both the \u2206r prompt-delay variable and energy resolution, both considered by DC in previous publications. The BG relies on high statistics samples of accidental BG obtained using the standard \"off-time window\" technique, as described in [13]. So, the overall training of the ANN makes the rejection insensitive to events with a neutron in the final state, which includes IBD's, all cosmogenic BG and some remaining accidental BG. This is consistent with the observation, again in Fig. 2, that the remaining accidental BG (dark grey) exhibits a clear irreducible H-n peak contribution. An important intrinsic feature of the ANN is that it internally constructs the best combined selection from all the input variables to achieve an optimal signal identification. This yields a superior background rejection as compared to the combination of simple individual cuts, as done in the Gd-only selection -irrelevant then since the accidental BG rate was negligible. The overall accidental BG rejection factor is \u2265400\u00d7 using the ANN, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The input ANN selection is so widely open that the selection efficiency in the GdT is close to 100% in the detector center due to the lower average capture time caused by the presence of Gd. The ANN mainly affects events in the GC which are most sensitive to the rejection of external accidental BG. Much of the ANN performance was explored, tuned and demonstrated during the H-n capture \u03b8 13 measurement [14]. Once the ANN-based IBD coincidence is defined, the unicity condition imposes that only two-fold coincidences are considered (consistent with IBD's). After the ANN, cosmogenic BG dominates, especially in the ND due to the lower overburden.",

Most of them have already been mentioned in past sections when demonstrating the minimal dependence of the \u03b8 13 measurement to the observed spectral distortion between the data and the prediction model. However, we shall highlight two other \u03b8 13 measurements with lower dependence on the model. First is the so called Data-to-Data (D2D) rate+shape \u03b8 13 fit. This fit determines \u03b8 13 by the comparison of the observed FD spectra to the prediction extracted from the ND spectrum. The model calculation is used only as the ratio of near versus far spectra, reducing the sensitivity to potential common model biases. The FD-I can be compared to the ND data with a correction using MC ratios, whose uncertainty is significantly smaller than the statistical precision. Likewise, common (or correlated) inter-detector effects are expected to fully cancel. The value obtained is sin 2 2\u03b8 13 =0.103 \u00b1 0.017 (sensitivity 0.0164 and \u03c7 2 /DoF: 28/37). The output inter-detector ratio exhibits no traces of spectral mismatch and looks identical to Fig. 4-(left). The excellent agreement found to the main result (deviation \u03b4 \u2264 0.002 units) further supports the negligible impact of the reactor model in the MD case. Second is the so called Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM) rate-only \u03b8 13 fit that has been articulated in past publications for the SD only [49]. The rate-only implementation makes the RRM spectral distortion independent, by construction, even though the reactor rate prediction is indeed used. This time the RRM prompt energy window has been confined to the [1.0,8.5] MeV range with a slightly better IBD signal to BG. This way, the is also shown. These numbers demonstrate that the nominal \u03b813 measurement is dominated by the rate-only information (systematics limited) of the best FD-II iso-flux data sample. Furthermore, releasing the constraint on |\u2206m 2 ee | does not impact the measured central value of \u03b813. Two alternative \u03b813 measurements are also shown for comparison: a) the Data-to-Data and b) the Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM). Both are expected to be immune to the reactor model spectrum distortion while excellent agreement is found (details in text). Last, the FD-I+FD-II SD \u03b813 measurements are also shown using two uncertainty prescriptions. The new data-driven prescription uses an increased 4\u03c3 reactor model shape uncertainty. The standard reactor model prescription is also shown, indicating a bias on the result. The agreement of the SD and MD, with the more conservative uncertainty and the much better \u03c7 2 /DoF, suggests the new prescription provides a better treatment of the data. The previous FD-I only SD \u03b813 measurement [13] (blue) is shown for reference. Bugey4 must be used in all SD to protect the rate normalisation.",

Before, the predicted shape appeared to be well reproduced by the world best data sample provided by the Bugey3 ex-  Figure 11: Shape-Only Reactor Spectral Distortion. The data to prediction spectral ratio for the latest DC-ND (black), DYB [38] (blue), RENO [11] (red), NEOS [55] (green) are shown, exhibiting a common dominant pattern predominantly characterised by the 5 MeV excess. Small differences across experiments are still possible but unresolved so far. The Bugey3 [51] (not shown) is the only experiment known not to reproduce this structure. This remains an issue. The RENO and NEOS normalisation has been modified relative to publications to ensure the shape-only condition (average R = 1) is met. The reactor model prediction shape-only uncertainty is shown in grey, which is significantly smaller than the dominant rate-only uncertainties. Since the same reactor model prediction is used, this uncertainty is expected to remain a representative guideline to all experiments. The 5 MeV excess is compensated by a deficit region [1.5,4.0] MeV for all experiments due to the shape-only condition. A good agreement is found between DC and Daya Baya data throughout the entire energy range. The non-trivial match among different experiments suggests that most detector and part of the reactor effects are accurately reproduced by the MC, thus cancelling across in R. This implies that the common reactor prediction model inaccuracies are expected to dominate the observed distortion. This is consistent with the fact that all other experiments use the same prediction strategy.",

The R N (ND) exhibits a 2.6\u03c3 rate deficit, where the uncertainty is largely dominated by the prediction normalisation of the reactor model, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The quoted significance could be lower in case the reactor model uncertainty would be underestimated. The R(Bugey4) illustrates the excellent agreement found between Bugey4 and DC data. Most experiments are consistent with these observations. The significant observation of a spectral distortion by the reactor-\u03b8 13 experiments, dominated by an excess of events around 5 MeV, has shed new light on the prediction capability of the reactor antineutrino spectrum. Its existence suggests the presence of sizeable shape inaccuracies in addition to the aforementioned rate-only deficit. The 5 MeV excess was first reported [52] and published by DC in 2014 [13]. Confirmations by RENO and DYB were reported shortly after. Today, there is a significant DC ND data to model disagreement when considering the full energy range. The ND and FD spectra, once corrected for \u03b8 13 , match within \u223c1\u03c3(stat) averaged over the full spectra. This is expected as effective cancellation across detectors has been demonstrated in Fig. 4, as a part of the \u03b8 13 measurement consistency. In addition, this distortion scales with reactor power: 6.4\u03c3 (ND) and 7.1\u03c3 (FD). So, an unknown new BG hypothesis is ruled out. The reactor model prediction and/or a residual non-linearity in the detector energy response [53] are both possible hypotheses. More exotic hypotheses have also been suggested [54].",

From the point of view of shape distortions, the leading order pattern is well reproduced by all latest experiments. Other past experiments are not conclusive but CHOOZ and Goesgen [56] data show a similar pattern. However, the Bugey3 experiment (not shown) exhibits a rather flat and featureless ratio spectrum, thus inconsistent with the shown experiments. The data to prediction ratio is expected to cancel (or suppress) the following contributions: a) the known and calibrated energy non-linearities, b) the detection effects (selection, vetoes, background subtraction bias), c) the \u03b8 13 spectral distortion, d) the reactor fuel burn-up and e) the overall shape of the reactor prediction, common to all experiments. However, energy response could be more complex since different detectors might have different capabilities to resolve spectral features. Nevertheless, most detector specific systematics are expected to be suppressed as a consequence of the MC tuning campaign to match the calibration data. So, while detector effects cannot be a priori ruled out, they are expected to be sub-dominant and not a priori identical across different experimental setups. Instead, the external reactor model, common to all experiments here considered, cannot be tuned to yield a data to prediction match.",

While all experiments plotted in Fig. 11 show similar behaviour, the RENO data seem to hint at a larger 5 MeV excess. NEOS, located in the same RENO reactor plant, also appears consistent with DC data. By rebinning the DC data to the DYB binning, the compatibility of both data sets can be studied. The DC data has been corrected to account for the non-linearity constrained during the \u03b8 13 fit and \u03b8 13 itself. The DC uncertainties consider statistics and systematics on both BG and energy. DC and DYB data are found consistent within uncertainties over the entire IBD energy spectrum. The best agreement manifests below 6 MeV. This observation disfavours detector driven effects as the main cause of the spectral distortion. Hence, the dominant cause appears to be the prediction inaccuracies in the reactor model. More data should further resolve the issue.",

So, today the undistorted Bugey3 spectrum remains an issue to be understood to be able to yield a coherent experimental vision. The need for further nuclear physics effort to improve the reactor model predictions remains a critical topic for high precision reactor neutrino physics. This is particularly important for any SD experiments. Last, a debate remains whether the main discrepancy feature is only the 5 MeV excess region since that part exhibits R\u21921, as illustrated in Fig. 4, in a rate+shape treatment.

Cosmogenic BGs are estimated during the fit since 9 Li (unconstraint) dominates in the [7.0,12.0] MeV region and fast-neutrons above 12 MeV. The impact of accidentals to the \u03b813 measurement is negligible. The data (BG subtracted)to prediction ratio is shown (bottom). The best fit solution (blue) contrasts with the no-oscillation hypothesis (red). Two dominant spectral distortions can be appreciated: the \u03b813 signature (mainly FD) and a common 5 MeV excess, leading to a large \u03c7 2 /DoF of 182/112. Bugey4 constrains the prediction rate. The normalisation with this constraint is lower as compared to the prediction rate not using the Bugey4 information.

The evolution of the TnC selection is illustrated in terms of IBD selection efficiency (solid lines), total BG rejection (dotted lines) and the accidental BG rejection (dashed lines). The estimation of the total BG rejection uses 17 days of 0-reactor data. The average singles rate per detector is \u223c10 s \u22121 . The first criterion corresponds to a time of [0.5,800] \u00b5s as a \"loose\" coincidence with a [1.0,20.0] MeV prompt and the [1.3,10.0] MeV delayed triggers. The rates are 2291 day \u22121(FD)and 2375 day \u22121 (ND), which imply a rejection factor of \u223c375 relative to singles. These numbers provide an absolute scale to the all other shown below. The \u2206r prompt-delay \u22641.2 m condition yields some important reduction. However, major accidental BG rejection is only obtained by the ANN with a \u223c400 rejection factor. After the ANN, the challenging correlated cosmogenic BG dominates the total BG rate, as expected due to the shallow overburden. The FD is better shielded. Extra rejection uses the cosmogenic vetoes. The overall rejection factors are \u223c193 (FD) and \u223c34 (ND) relative to the loose coincidence.",

The nominal \u03b813 measurement (top) can be decomposed into a) the rate-only and shape-only contributions, b) FD-I (no ND) and FD-II (isoflux) contributions. A measurement without marginalising over |\u2206m 2 ee | as (2.484\u00b10.036)\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2[36] is also shown. These numbers demonstrate that the nominal \u03b813 measurement is dominated by the rate-only information (systematics limited) of the best FD-II iso-flux data sample. Furthermore, releasing the constraint on |\u2206m2 ee | does not impact the measured central value of \u03b813. Two alternative \u03b813 measurements are also shown for comparison: a) the Data-to-Data and b) the Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM). Both are expected to be immune to the reactor model spectrum distortion while excellent agreement is found (details in text). Last, the FD-I+FD-II SD \u03b813 measurements are also shown using two uncertainty prescriptions. The new data-driven prescription uses an increased 4\u03c3 reactor model shape uncertainty. The standard reactor model prescription is also shown, indicating a bias on the result. The agreement of the SD and MD, with the more conservative uncertainty and the much better \u03c7 2 /DoF, suggests the new prescription provides a better treatment of the data. The previous FD-I only SD \u03b813 measurement[13] (blue) is shown for reference. Bugey4 must be used in all SD to protect the rate normalisation.",
