            "text": "Results are presented from a search for supersymmetry in events with a single electron or muon and hadronic jets. The data correspond to a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment. A number of exclusive search regions are defined according to the number of jets, the number of b-tagged jets, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum and the transverse momentum of the lepton. Standard model background events are reduced significantly by requiring a large azimuthal angle between the direction of the lepton and of the reconstructed W boson, computed under the hypothesis that all of the missing transverse momentum in the event arises from a neutrino produced in the leptonic decay of the W boson. The numbers of observed events are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes, and the results are used to set lower limits on supersymmetric particle masses in the context of two simplified models of gluino pair production. In the first model, where each gluino decays to a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, gluino masses up to 1.8 TeV are excluded at the 95% CL. The second model considers a three-body decay to a light quarkantiquark pair and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a neutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to 1.9 TeV.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is a promising extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics. The addition of supersymmetric partners to the SM particles can lead to the suppression of quadratically divergent loop corrections to the mass squared of the Higgs boson [9]. Furthermore, in SUSY models with R-parity conservation [10], the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) can provide a dark matter candidate [11,12]. This paper presents a search for SUSY in the single-lepton channel using data recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The analysis is an update of the search in Ref. [13], which was performed using the significantly smaller data sample collected by CMS in 2015. Similar searches were performed by the CMS and ATLAS experiments at \u221a s = 7 TeV [14][15][16], 8 TeV [17][18][19], and 13 TeV [20][21][22].",

The isolation is characterized by the scalar sum of the transverse momenta (p T ) of all particles within a cone of radius R = \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 around the lepton momentum vector, excluding the contribution of the lepton and the contribution of charged particles not associated with the primary interaction vertex. In the calculation of the isolation variable, an area-based correction is employed to remove the contribution of particles from \"pileup\" [29], i.e. additional protonproton collisions within the same or neighboring bunch crossings. The isolation variable I rel is defined as the ratio of the scalar sum of the p T in the cone to the transverse momentum of the lepton, p T .

The momentum of a jet, which is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the full p T spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from pileup [29]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and confirmed with in-situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, Z+jets, and photon+jet events [33]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. They have negligible impact on the efficiency for signal events. Jets originating from b quarks are identified with an inclusive combined secondary vertex tagging algorithm (CSVv2) [34,35] that uses both secondary-vertex and track-based information. The working point is chosen to provide a b tagging efficiency of \u224863%, a c tagging efficiency of \u224812%, and a light-flavor and gluon misidentification rate of \u22480.9% for jets with p T > 20 GeV in simulated tt events [35].",

Events with a single top quark in the final state are generated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) powhegv2.0 and powheg programs [37][38][39][40][41] for the t-channel and tW production, respectively. The s-channel single-top process and the production of both ttW and ttZ, commonly referred to as ttV, are simulated using the NLO MadGraph5_amc@nlo v.2.2.2 generator [36]. The simulated background samples are normalized using the most accurate cross section calculations available [36,[40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50], which generally correspond to NLO or next-to-NLO (NNLO) precision. All signal events are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo v.2.2.2, with up to two final-state partons in addition to the gluino pair. Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo uses the NNPDF3.0LO and the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF [51] for processes with LO or NLO accuracy, respectively. Gluino decays are based on a unit matrix element [52], with signal production cross sections computed at NLO with next-to-leadinglogarithm (NLL) accuracy [53][54][55][56][57].",

In simulation, all jets that cannot be matched to daughter particles from the hard interaction are treated as ISR jets. The difference between the number of ISR jets observed and simulated is then used to reweigh simulated tt+jets events in all analysis selections. The reweighting factors vary between 0.92 and 0.51 for N ISR J between 1 and 6. We take one half of the deviation from unity as the systematic uncertainty on these reweighting factors.",

            "text": "The presence of two neutrinos in dilepton tt+jets events tends to produce larger angles between the lepton and the presumed W boson than in single-lepton tt+jets events. As a result, the fraction of dilepton tt+jets in which the second lepton does not pass the veto lepton requirements, is larger at high \u03c6 values, i.e. in the SR, than in the CR. This fraction as a function of n jet must be described well in the simulation, as the differences in the transfer factors between the low-n jet and high-n jet events, i.e. the \u03ba factors, are determined in simulation. This assumption is tested using dilepton events, selected as described in the previous paragraph and split into a 0-b and a multi-b category. To study the behavior of the background from dilepton events that remain in the singlelepton selection because of the loss of one lepton, one of the two leptons is removed from the event. Since in this type of background, the lost leptons arise principally from \u03c4 \u2192 hadrons + \u03bd decays, and to account for the p miss T due to the neutrino from the \u03c4 decay, the lepton removed is replaced by a jet with 2/3 of the p T of the original lepton and the L T , \u03c6, and H T values are recalculated for the resulting \"single-lepton\" event. To maximize the number of events in the dilepton tt+jets control sample, no \u03c6 requirement is applied, and all events are used twice, with each reconstructed lepton considered as the lost lepton. The jet multiplicity in the single-lepton baseline selection (excluding the SR) is compared with that in the corresponding simulated event sample. In addition, the jet multiplicity in the dilepton tt+jets control sample in data is compared with the corresponding simulated event sample. From these two comparisons a double-ratio is formed. The remaining differences in the double-ratio, which are of the order of 3-6% per n jet bin, are corrected through the calculated \u03ba factors, and propagated as a systematic uncertainty.",

The event yields observed in data are in agreement with the standard model background, which is estimated using control regions in data and corrections based on simulation. The lack of any significant excess of events is interpreted in terms of limits on the parameters of two simplified models that describe gluino pair production.",

The transverse momentum of the leptonically decaying W boson is estimated as the sum of p T and p miss T vectors. In background events from W+jets and tt+jets with a single W-boson's leptonic decay, the \u03c6 distribution falls sharply and has a maximum value determined by the mass and p T of the W boson. In the SUSY models investigated here, p miss T receives a large contribution from the two neutralino LSPs. As a consequence, large values of \u03c6 are possible and the resulting \u03c6 distribution in signal events is roughly uniform. The \u03c6 variable can therefore be used to define the search region (SR) as events with large \u03c6, while events with small \u03c6 constitute the control region (CR), which is used to estimate the SM background in the SR.
