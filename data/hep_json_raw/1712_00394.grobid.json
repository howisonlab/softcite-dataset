            "text": "Metastable domains of fluctuating topological charges can change the chirality of quarks and induce local parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. This can lead to observable charge separation along the direction of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the charge-dependent azimuthal correlator (\u2206\u03b3) is the intrinsic particle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal elliptical anisotropy (v 2 ). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field direction and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the v 2 -induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two studies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. 1The \u2206\u03b3 should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au collisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry fluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant \u2206\u03b3 is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting a background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au collisions where the multiplicity and v 2 scaled correlator is similar. (2) A new approach is devised to study \u2206\u03b3 as a function of the particle pair invariant mass (m inv ) to identify the resonance backgrounds and hence to extract the possible CME signal. Signal is consistent with zero within uncertainties at high m inv . Signal at low m inv , extracted from a two-component model assuming smooth mass dependence, is consistent with zero within uncertainties.",

This is called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). An observation of the CME-induced charge separation would confirm a fundamental property of QCD.

Significant \u2206\u03b3 has indeed been observed e-mail: zhao656@purdue.edu in heavy-ion collisions [8][9][10][11][12][13]. One of the difficulties in its interpretation as from the CME is the major charge-dependent background contributions to the \u2206\u03b3 observable [14][15][16], such as those from resonance decays. The \u2206\u03b3 variable is ambiguous between an OS pair from the CME back-to-back perpendicular to \u03c8 2 and an OS pair from a resonance decay along \u03c8 2 . More resonances are produced along the \u03c8 2 than perpendicular to it, the relative difference of which is quantified by the elliptical anisotropy parameter v 2 of the resonances. The CME background arises from the coupling of this elliptical anisotropy and the intrinsic decay correlation [17].",

In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the \u03c8 PP , although fluctuating [18], is generally aligned with the reaction plane (span by the impact parameter direction and the beam), thus generally perpendicular to B. The \u2206\u03b3 measurement is thus entangled by the two contributions: the possible CME and the v 2induced background. In small-system collisions, however, the \u03c8 PP is determined purely by geometry fluctuations, uncorrelated to the impact parameter or the B direction [19]. As a result any CME would average to zero \u2206\u03b3 in small-system collisions. Background sources, on the other hand, contribute to small-system collisions similarly as to heavy-ion collisions when measured with respect to the event plane reconstructed from mid-rapidity particle momenta (as a proxy to the \u03c8 PP ). Due to the fluctuating nature of the small systems, the event planes reconstructed over a large pseudorapidity gap can be uncorrelated, and therefore measurements of mid-rapidity particle correlations with respect to a forward event plane are sensitive neither to CME nor to the background.",

The v 2,c used for resolution correction should, ideally, be free of non-flow. We obtain v 2,c by the two-particle cumulant, applying a cut of \u2206\u03b7 > 1.0 to reduce non-flow contaminations.",

Figure 1 shows \u2206\u03b3 as a function of the \u2206\u03b7 between particle \u03b1 and \u03b2 in p+Au and d+Au collisions, and in peripheral Au+Au collisions for comparison. The distributions from p+Au and d+Au collisions are similar to those in peripheral Au+Au collisions.  Here N is taken as the geometric mean of the multiplicities of particle \u03b1 and \u03b2. The systematic uncertainties on \u03b3 are estimated by varying the track quality cuts, the correction method used for the detector non-uniform azimuthal acceptance, and the p T range of the reference particle c. For comparison the corresponding Au+Au results are also shown. The trends of the correlator magnitudes are similar, decreasing with increasing N. The \u03b3 SS results seem to follow a smooth trend in N over all systems. The \u03b3 OS results are less so; the small system data appear to differ somewhat from the heavy-ion data over the range in which they overlap in N. Since the particle pseudorapidity density, dN/d\u03b7, is asymmetric in small systems, there are relatively more small \u2206\u03b7 pairs than in Au+Au collisions, hence larger correlations. We have checked this effect by weighting particles in computing the correlator such that the weighted dN/d\u03b7 is symmetric, and found it insufficient to account for the observed difference. Similar to LHC, the small system data at RHIC are found to be comparable to Au+Au results at similar multiplicities. Since the p+Au and d+Au data are all backgrounds, the \u2206\u03b3 should be approximately proportional to the averaged v 2 of the background sources, in turn the v 2 of final-state particles.   It should also be proportional to the number of background sources, and, because \u2206\u03b3 is a pair-wise average, inversely proportional to the total number of pairs. As the number of background sources likely scales with multiplicity, we have \u2206\u03b3 \u221d v 2 /N. Therefore, to gain more insight, we scale the \u2206\u03b3 by N/v 2 :",

Since in p+Au and d+Au collisions only the background is present, the data suggest that the peripheral Au+Au measurement may be largely, if not all, background. For both small-system and heavy-ion collisions, the \u2206\u03b3 scaled is approximately constant over N.

Figure 4 (Left) shows the OS and SS \u03c0\u03c0 pair difference as a function of m inv from minimum bias p+p and peripheral Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV [26]. Many resonances have broad mass distributions [27]. They are often identified statistically in relativistic heavy ion collisions. However statistical identification of resonances does not help eliminate their contribution to the \u2206\u03b3 variable. Most of the \u03c0\u03c0 resonances are located in the low m inv region [26]. With increasing mass, the data show that resonance contributions to the difference between OS and SS pairs decrease. It is possible to exclude them \"entirely\" by applying a lower cut on m inv . In the low mass region we analyze the \u2206\u03b3 correlator as a function of m inv , which may help to understand the background sources and isolate the possible CME [28]. Figure 4 (Right) shows the \u2206\u03b3 results with and without applying an invariant mass cut of m inv > 1.5 GeV/c 2 . The results are summarized in Table 1. With the m inv cut, the \u2206\u03b3 is significantly reduced from the inclusive measurement. The \u2206\u03b3 with the large m inv cut is consistent with zero within the current uncertainty.  CME is expected to be a low p T phenomenon [8,29]; its contribution to high mass may be small. In order to extract CME at low mass, resonance contributions need to be subtracted.

We assume that the CME component is smooth in m inv . If the CME contribution was appreciable, then the ratio of \u2206\u03b3/r shown in Fig. 5 (c) would reveal a structure resembling the inverse shape of r [28]. However, a more or less smooth dependence is observed; no evidence of an inverse shape of the resonance mass distribution is observed in the ratio of \u2206\u03b3/r, suggesting insignificant CME signal contributions. In order to isolate the possible CME from the resonance contributions, the two-component model is used to fit the \u2206\u03b3 as a function of m inv . We use the first-order polynomial function for R(m inv ),   motivated by the data in Fig. 5 (c) and MC simulation [28]. At present, no theoretical calculation is available on the m inv dependence of the CME, therefore we consider two cases: (i) a constant CME distribution independent of m inv , and (ii) an exponential CME distribution in m inv . The curve superimposed in Fig. 5 (b) shows the fit of case (i). The extracted average \u2206\u03b3 from CME contributions, and their strengths relative to the inclusive \u2206\u03b3 measurement are tabulated in Table 2. The extracted CME signals from the two-component model fits are at present consistent with zero within uncertainties. Future theoretical calculations of the CME mass dependence would be valuable.  The chiral magnetic effect (CME) can produce charge separation perpendicular to the reaction plane. Charge separation measurements by the three-particle correlators (\u2206\u03b3) are contaminated by a major background arising from particle correlations coupled with elliptical anisotropy (v 2 ). To shed more light on the background and to reduce/eliminate background contamination in charge separation measurements, we have studied the small-system p+Au and d+Au collisions in comparison to Au+Au collisions, and the \u2206\u03b3 correlator as a function of the particle pair invariant mass (m inv ). With respect to the second-order harmonic plane (\u03c8 2 ), the p+Au and d+Au charge dependent correlations are backgrounds. Peripheral Au+Au data are similar to those of p+Au and d+Au. The scaled correlator (\u2206\u03b3\u00d7N/v 2 ) from peripheral to mid-central Au+Au collisions is approximately constant over multiplicity. Similar dependence is found in AMPT. These data indicate a dominant contribution from background to the peripheral and mid-central heavy-ion collisions, and do not show clear evidence for the presence of the CME in those collisions.",
