The first class consists of hadronic decays into three pseudoscalar mesons, such as \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0, while the second class has radiative decays into vector particles with quantum number J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , such as \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c1\u03b3, or \u03c9\u03b3. Model-dependent approaches for describing low energy mesonic interactions, such as vector meson dominance (VMD) [2], and the applicability of chiral perturbation theory [2] can be tested in \u03b7 \u2032 decays.",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based multilayer drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI (Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T (0.9 T for the 2012 run period) magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with modules of resistive plate muon counters (MUC) interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% of the full 4\u03c0 solid angle. The momentum resolution for charged particles at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the resolution of the ionization energy loss per unit path-length (dE/dx) is 6%. The EMC measures photon energies with a resolution of 2.5% (5%) at 1 GeV in the barrel (end-caps). The time resolution for the TOF is 80 ps in the barrel and 110 ps in the end-caps.

The distribution of the distance from the reconstructed vertex point of an electron-positron pair to the z axis, defined as R xy , is shown in Fig. 3 (a).

From the distribution of M (e + e \u2212 ) versus R xy and the M (e + e \u2212 ) projections, shown in Figs. 3 (b) and (c), the requirement of R xy < 2 cm can cleanly discriminate signal from the background. The number of peaking background events from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 that still survive is estimated to be 2.6\u00b10.3 from MC simulation taking the branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 from this analysis, where the error is statistical.
