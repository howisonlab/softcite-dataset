We searched for the light vector mediator of this dark force, the U boson, with the KLOE detector at the DA NE e + e \u2212 collider. Using an integrated luminosity of 1.54 fb \u22121 , we studied the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3, with U \u2192 e + e \u2212 , using radiative return to search for a resonant peak in the dielectron invariant-mass distribution. We did not find evidence for a signal, and set a 90% CL upper limit on the mixing strength between the Standard Model photon and the dark photon, \u03b5 2 , at 10 \u22126 -10 \u22124 in the 5-520 MeV/c 2 mass range.",

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has received further confirmation with the discovery of the Higgs boson [1][2][3], however, there are strong hints of physics it cannot explain, such as neutrino oscillations [4] and the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [5]. Furthermore, the SM does not provide a dark matter (DM) candidate usually advocated as an explanation of the numerous gravitational anomalies observed in the universe. Many extensions of the SM [6][7][8][9][10] consider a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) as a viable DM candidate and assume that WIMPs are charged under a new kind of interaction. The mediator of the new force would be a gauge vector boson, the U boson, also referred to as a dark photon or A . It would be produced during WIMP annihilations, have a mass less than two proton masses, and a leptonic decay channel in order to explain the astrophysical observations recently reported by many experiments [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21].",

At the level of coupling accessible by KLOE in this channel the U boson is expected to decay promptly leaving its signal as a resonant peak in the invariant-mass distribution of the lepton pair. The energy scan was performed by applying the radiative return method which consists of selecting the events in which either electron or positron emits an initial-state radiation (ISR) photon which carries away a part of the energy and effectively changes the amount of the energy available for U boson production. The selected initial-and final-state particles are the same as in the radiative Bhabha scattering process so we receive contributions from resonant s-channel, non-resonant t-channel U boson exchanges, and from s-t interference. The finite-width effects related to s-channel annihilation sub-processes, scattering t-channel and s-t interference are of order of U /m U for the integrated cross section and can be neglected with respect to any potential resonance we would observe; U \u223c 10 \u22127 -10 \u22122 MeV for the coupling strengths to which we are sensitive [30]. The non-resonant t-channel effects would not produce a peak in the invariant-mass distribution but could, in principle, appear in analyses of angular distributions or asymmetries.

The center-of-mass energy of the collision depends on the amount of energy carried away by the initial-state radiation (ISR) photon. The irreducible background originates from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 radiative Bhabha scattering process, having the same three final-state particles. The reducible backgrounds consist of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (where one photon converts into an e + e \u2212 pair), and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , as well as other \u03c6 decays.

            "text": "We selected events with three separate calorimeter energy deposits corresponding to two oppositely-charged lepton tracks and a photon. The final-state electron, positron, and photon were required to be emitted at large angle (55 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 125 \u2022 ) with respect to the beam axis, such that they are explicitly detected in the barrel of the calorimeter, see Fig. 1. The large-angle selection greatly suppresses the t-channel contribution from the irreducible Bhabha-scattering background which is strongly peaked at small angle. Since we are interested mostly in the low invariant-mass region, we select only events with a hard photon, E \u03b3 > 305 MeV, chosen to select a subsample of the events generated by our MC simulation. We required both lepton tracks to have a first DC hit within a radius of 50 cm from the beam axis and a point-ofclosest-approach (PCA) to the beam axis within the fiducial cylinder, \u03c1 PCA < 1 cm and \u22126 < z PCA < 6 cm, entirely contained within the vacuum pipe eliminating background events from photons converting on the vacuum wall. We eliminated tightly spiralling tracks by requiring either a large transverse or a large longitudinal momentum for each of the lepton tracks, p T > 160 MeV/c or p z > 90 MeV/c. We require that the total momentum of the charged tracks is (|p e + | + |p e \u2212 |) > 150 MeV/c to avoid the presence of poorly reconstructed tracks. A pseudo-likelihood discriminant was used to separate electrons from muons and pions [37]. A further discrimination from muons and pions was achieved using the M track variable. M track is the X mass for an X + X \u2212 \u03b3 final state, computed using energy and momentum conservation, assuming [37]. In Fig. 2 the M track distribution is reported for measured data and for all the relevant MC simulated background components. Including the cut M track < 70 MeV/c 2 we were left with 681,196 events at the end of the full analysis chain. ",

There are two effects that contribute to the uncertainty in the radiator function, H(m ee ). First, since the value of H(m ee ) is taken from simulated data, we must take into account the statistical uncertainty on those values. Second, we assume a uniform 0.5% systematic uncertainty in the calculation of H(m ee ), as quoted in [43,[52][53][54]. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 0.3% [37].

The numbers quoted here correspond to the largest estimate within our m ee range. Phokhara MC simulation[43] was performed to evaluate the generator-level efficiency due to the restriction E MC \u03b3 > 300 MeV and 50 \u2022 < \u03b8 MC e + ,e \u2212 < 130 \u2022 . The selection efficiency and the generator-level efficiency are combined to give the total efficiency,",
