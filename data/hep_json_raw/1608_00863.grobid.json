The anomalously large CPviolating effects in the like-sign dimuon asymmetry measured by the D0 Collaboration [1] could be explained by the presence of direct CPV in semileptonic decays. This article presents the first measurement of the direct CP-violating charge asymmetry.

This allows for a cancellation of first-order effects related to instrumental charge and momentum reconstruction asymmetries. To ensure a more complete cancellation of the uncertainties, the events are weighted according to the number of \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 D 0 decays collected in each configuration of the magnet polarities (polarity weighting). The weighting is based on the number of events containing D 0 decay products that pass the selection criteria and the likelihood selection (described below), and that are in the K + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass range used for the fit. The data are collected with a suite of single and dimuon triggers. B + mesons are selected using their semileptonic decays B + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 D 0 by applying criteria similar to those used in Ref. [6].

This correction also includes the systematic uncertainty due to track reconstruction. The correction for a difference in behavior between positively and negatively charged kaons is calculated using the measured kaon reconstruction asymmetry presented in Ref. [8]. Negative kaons can interact with matter to produce hyperons, while there is no equivalent interaction for positive kaons. As a result, the mean path length for positive kaons is larger, the reconstruction efficiency is higher, and the kaon asymmetry A K is positive.",

We generate a MC sample using the pythia event generator [12] modified to use evtgen [13] for the decay of hadrons containing b or c quarks. The pythia inclusive QCD production model is used. Events recorded in random beam crossings are overlaid on the simulated events to quantify the effect of additional collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings. Events are selected that contain at least one muon and a D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 or D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay. The generated events are processed by the full simulation chain, and then by the same reconstruction and selection algorithms as used to select events from real data. The mean proper decay lengths of b hadrons are fixed in the simulation to values close to, but not exactly equal to, the current world-average values [11]. To correct for these differences, an event weighting is applied to all nonprompt events in the simulation, based on the generated lifetime of the B candidate, to give the world-average B meson lifetimes. To estimate the effects of the trigger selection and the reconstruction on the data, we weight each event based on the transverse momentum of the reconstructed muon. The combined weighting applied to each MC event i is given by w i . Combining all of these corrections, we find f B + = 0.56.",
