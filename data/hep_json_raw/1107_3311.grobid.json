Events are selected using a minimum bias trigger, allowing jets at very low transverse momentum to be observed and their characteristics in the transition to high-momentum fully perturbative jets to be studied. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm applied to charged particles with two radius parameter choices, 0.4 and 0.6. An inclusive charged jet transverse momentum cross section measurement from 4 GeV to 100 GeV is shown for four ranges in rapidity extending to 1.9 and corrected to charged particlelevel truth jets. The transverse momenta and longitudinal momentum fractions of charged particles within jets are measured, along with the charged particle multiplicity and the particle density as a function of radial distance from the jet axis. Comparison of the data with the theoretical models implemented in existing tunings of Monte Carlo event generators indicates reasonable overall agreement between data and Monte Carlo. These comparisons are sensitive to Monte Carlo parton showering, hadronization, and soft physics models.",

These models have free parameters that must in turn be tuned to data.",

These properties will be compared to a range of Monte Carlo tunes derived from previously measured data, allowing the study of the transition between the MC generators' separatelyimplemented models of soft strong interactions and perturbative QCD. This measurement is complementary to others that are used for comparison with models of soft QCD, such as inclusive charged particle kinematic distributions [3] and underlying event properties [4], and may shed light on the limited ability of existing models to describe both types of measurements simultaneously with a single set of tunable parameters [5]. At higher momenta, track-based jet measurements provide a complement to calorimeter-based measurements [6,7], with results independent of calorimeter calibrations, selections, and uncertainties. Jets have previously been measured using charged particles in proton-proton collisions at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings [8], and in proton-antiproton collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron [9] and Fermilab Tevatron [10]. The momentum fraction of charged particles with respect to calorimeter jets has also been measured [11,12]. Related fragmentation measurements in electronpositron and electron-proton collisions are reviewed in Ref. [13].",

The distribution of jet momenta, jet track multiplicity, and kinematic properties of tracks within these track-based jets are corrected back to truth-level charged particle jets, which are defined to be the jets obtained when the same algorithm is applied to all primary charged particles emerging from the proton-proton collision with the same p T cut.",

The L1 triggers use custom fast electronics; the L2 and EF further refine selections in software, with L2 using a subset of the event information for rapid processing and EF reconstructing complete events. For this measurement, the trigger relies on the L1 signals from the beam pickup timing devices (BPTX) and the minimum bias trigger scintillators (MBTS). The BPTX stations are composed of electrostatic button pick-up detectors attached to the beam pipe at AE175 m from the center of the ATLAS detector. The coincidence of the BPTX signal between the two sides of the detector is used to determine when bunches are colliding in the center of the detector. The MBTS are mounted on each side of the detector at Z \u00bc AE3:56 m. They are segmented into eight sectors in azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity (2:09 < jj < 2:82 and 2:82 < jj < 3:84). Data were collected for this analysis using a trigger requiring a BPTX coincidence and MBTS trigger signals. The MBTS trigger used for this paper is configured to require one hit above threshold from either side of the detector, referred to as a single-arm trigger.",

VII. The Perugia family of tunes [22] uses the CTEQ5L [23] parton distributions; there is a central value (''Perugia 0'') and several variants that attempt to bracket the possible changes in tune parameters that are permitted in fitting existing data. Two variants, ''Perugia HARD'' and ''Perugia SOFT'', are created by changing the initial-state radiation cutoff scale so that the perturbative contribution is different, while other parameters are adjusted to bring the tuned distributions back into agreement. Perugia HARD (SOFT) has more (fewer) jets per event with higher (lower) average momentum, and a higher (lower) average charged multiplicity. The Perugia 2010 variant is an adjustment of Perugia 0 that improves the description of jet shapes and adjusts hadronization parameters for better consistency with LEP data, given that the original values for these parameters were based on Q 2 shower ordering; in particular, it has an adjusted yield of strange particles. Perugia NOCR (''no color reconnection'') represents an effort to reproduce the same data with no color reconnection model used; it is used in computing systematic uncertainties, but because it could not be made to fit all the original tuning data it is not included on comparison plots. All PYTHIA tunes described thus far use p T -ordered showering; the DW tune is also used in order to include the impact of Q 2 ordering.",

High-p T Tracks: Despite the tightening of the d 0 cut for high-momentum tracks, 0.6% (8.3%) of selected tracks in the simulation with momentum above 10 (40) GeV do not have a matching truth particle with momentum within 50%. These high-momentum mismeasured tracks are primarily associated with wide-angle scatterings in the material of the inner detector that create the appearance of a single, straight track [3]. Were the fraction of such tracks similar in data, their impact on the measurement would be accounted for in the unfolding procedure. However, the data have a larger fraction of high-p T tracks failing the d 0 cut (2.3%) than does the MC (1.6%).

The upper bound of this uncertainty assumes that all such extra tracks are well-measured, but did not pass the d 0 cut due to improperly modeled resolution. The lower bound is based on the assumption that the increase in rejected tracks corresponds to a proportional increase in accepted mismeasured tracks. These uncertainties are then propagated to each measured jet bin, with the scale factor determined by the fraction of jets in a given jet bin with their leading track in each momentum range. Thus the correction is largest for high jet momentum and low number of particles per jet, because these jets have the highest leading track momenta. This uncertainty on the reconstructed data is then used to scale the measured distributions, with the unfolding applied in each case and compared to the unfolded central value. The resulting differences in each measured bin give the final uncertainty due to high-momentum mismeasured tracks. This correction is also applied to the z, p rel T and r distributions. Each bin is scaled in proportion to the fraction of tracks in that bin that come from a jet whose leading track is in a given range, in proportion to the uncertainty on tracks in that range. The corrections are only significant for high-z bins in high-p T jets. The corrections are then propagated through the unfolding as in the jet-based distributions, and the result compared to the central value.",

The study of jets with tracks allows for precise measurements of low-momentum jets and their properties, thus complementing calorimeter-based jet measurements and allowing the study of the transition from soft collisions to jet production in the perturbative regime of QCD. It also provides additional observables for consideration in the tuning of MC event generators, which complement existing ''minimum bias '' and underlying event measurements. No tune or model presented here agrees with all quantities measured within their uncertainties, suggesting that future MC tunes may be improved. Difficulty in modeling the transition between soft and perturbative physics is indicated by disagreements between data and all MC distributions in the 10-20 GeV range in the dependence of the charged jet cross section on jet momentum. Dependence of the cross section on rapidity is consistent with predictions. Particles with large transverse momentum p rel T with respect to the jet that contains them are produced more copiously than any model predicts, as are jets with large charged particle multiplicity. The longitudinal momentum fraction z is best described by the PYTHIA 6.421 AMBT1 tune. The charged particle number density ch \u00f0r\u00de is well-described by the PYTHIA 6.421 AMBT1, PYTHIA 8.145 4C, and HERWIG++ 2.5.1 UE7 tunes. With the exception of the HERWIG++ 2.4.2 default tune, which greatly disagrees with these measurements, all models appear to underestimate the contribution of the underlying event required to model the data.",
