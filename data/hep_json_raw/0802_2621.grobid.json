            "text": "It is well known that the number of fundamental fermion families (generations) is not fixed by the Standard Model (SM). The precision measurements performed by the Large Electron-Positron Collider experiments at the Z pole have shown that the number of families with light neutrinos (m \u03bd < m Z /2) is equal to three. On the other hand, the asymptotic freedom in QCD constrains this number to be less than nine. Therefore, from a pure experimentalist approach, it is meaningful to search for a possible fourth SM family at the forthcoming colliders. On the theoretical side, the fourth SM family is a direct outcome of the flavor democracy (or in other words democratic mass matrix) approach [1][2][3] which is strongly motivated by the naturalness arguments (see the review [4] and the references therein). Meanwhile, there are phenomenological arguments against the existence of a fifth SM family [5]. In this paper, the additional quark and lepton pairs of the fourth family are denoted as u 4 , d 4 and e 4 , \u03bd 4 .",

The partial wave unitarity gives an a e-mail: Gokhan.Unel@cern.ch upper bound of about 1 TeV to the fourth family fermion masses [7]. According to flavor democracy, the masses of the new quarks have to be within few GeV of each other. This is also experimentally hinted by the value of the \u03c1 parameter which is close to unity [8]. Therefore, if the fourth SM family exists, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will copiously produce its quarks [9] and the proposed linear colliders will provide opportunity to discover its leptons [10]. As the single production of the new quarks in LHC is suppressed as compared to their pair production, due to the small value of the CKM matrix elements, the latter is considered. The new quarks, being heavy, will decay to the known SM quarks and W bosons. The dominant decay channels are defined by the 4 \u00d7 4 extension of the CKM mixing matrix with two distinct possibilities:",

The direct background is from SM events which yield exactly the same final state particles as the signal events. The contributions from same sign W bosons are insignificant. Some of the indirect backgrounds are also taken into account. The dominant contribution is from tt pair production where the b jets from the decay of the top quark could be mistagged as a light jet. Similarly the jet associated top-quark pair production (ttj \u2192 W \u2212 W + bbj ) contributes substantially to the SM background as the production cross section is comparable to the pair production and only one mistagged b-jet is sufficient to fake the signal events. The cross section for the next-order process, namely pp \u2192 tt2j , has been computed to be four times smaller than tt j process in the relevant jet-momentum range and therefore has not been considered. It should be noted that the tt and ttj samples have been conservatively added together, in spite of the fact that initial and final-state parton showers simulated in Pythia for the former would account for part of the cross section for the latter. Finally, background from SM processes with W \u00b1 Zqq (q = u, d, s, c) final state has been studied. Its contribution to the total background is very similar to the direct (W Wjj ) background. All the mentioned background processes have been generated with MadGraph v3.95 [19]. This tree-level generator was previously shown to give results in good agreement with CompHEP and to be more suitable for running on a computer farm [20]. A total of more than 280 thousand events generated at different QCD scales and jet selection criteria comprise the background sample. The events from both generators are fed into the AT-LAS detector simulation and event reconstruction framework, ATHENA v11.0.41, with the CompHEP events using the interface program CPYTH v2.0.1 [21]. Parton showering, hadronization and fragmentation are simulated using the ATHENA interface of Pythia v6.23 [22] and the detector response is obtained from the fast simulation software, ATLFast [23]. This software uses a parameterized function to calculate the final particle kinematic variables rapidly, and its output is calibrated to match the results from GEANTbased full detector simulation [24]. The physics objects from ATLFast are used in the final analysis in ROOT 5.12 [25].",

The two-fold ambiguity in the longitudinal direction of the neutrino is resolved by choosing the solution with the lower neutrino energy. The four-momenta of the third and fourth most energetic jets in the event are combined to reconstruct the hadronically decaying W boson. Due to the high momentum of the W boson in the signal events particularly for the high values of the q 4 mass, the jets are not always resolved in the detector. When this happens, one of the two jets used in the combination is a random jet, which spuriously increases the invariant mass, m W jj , of the reconstructed W . Such cases cause a long high-end tail in the invariant mass distribution for the signal as shown in Fig. 2c. In order to reduce their adverse effect on the final m q 4 distributions, events with m W jj > 200 GeV are rejected, even though the comparison of the distributions for the signal and the background would suggest that a looser criterion would benefit the final statistical significance.",

Each reconstructed W is associated with one of the two hardest jets, for which the minimum transverse momentum requirements are tightened to p jet T > 100 GeV. As observed in Fig. 2d, this tighter requirement has no significant effect on the signal, while substantially reducing the background. A tighter p jet T selection would start to skew the final invariant mass distributions. Therefore the lower value of 100 GeV was chosen so that the analysis results could be safely interpreted for lower q 4 masses as well. The W -jet association ambiguity is resolved by selecting the combination which results in the smallest difference between the masses of the two reconstructed q 4 quarks in the same event. If this mass difference is more than 100 GeV for either combination, the event is rejected. The summary of the event selection cuts and their efficiencies for both signal and background events are listed in Table 2 for a quark mass of 500 GeV. These selection criteria were not optimized for the m q 4 = 750 GeV case to be safely pessimistic. The results of the reconstruction for quark masses of 500 GeVand 750 GeV are shown in Fig. 3 together with various backgrounds for integrated luminosities of 1 and  Table 2, respectively. Signal and background histograms have been scaled to the same luminosity, except in plot c, where the histograms have been normalized to unit area 10 fb \u22121 respectively.
