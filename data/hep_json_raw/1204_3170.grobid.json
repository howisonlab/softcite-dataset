The data sample was collected with the CMS detector at the LHC during 2010 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 . The mean charged-hadron multiplicity, the differential and integral jet shape distributions, and two independent moments of the shape distributions are measured as functions of the jet transverse momentum for jets reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm. The measured observables are corrected to the particle level and compared with predictions from various QCD Monte Carlo generators.",

            "text": "The jet transverse momentum profile (shape) [1,2], transverse size, and charged-hadron multiplicity in jets are sensitive to multiple parton emissions from the primary outgoing parton and provide a powerful test of the parton showering approximation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. Recently, there have been many methods proposed to search for heavy particles by studying the substructure of jets formed by their decay products, as these particles can be highly boosted and thus their decay products are well collimated [3][4][5][6]. Jets arising from the fragmentation of a single parton, hereafter referred to as QCD jets, contribute to backgrounds in searches for such boosted-object jets. A good understanding of the QCD jet structure is very important for these searches to be successful. The structures of gluon-initiated and quark-initiated jets are different due to their different fragmentation properties. QCD predicts gluoninitiated jets to have a higher average particle multiplicity and a broader distribution of particle transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction compared to quarkinitiated jets. Jet structure measurements test these predictions and can be used to develop techniques to discriminate between gluon and quark jets. Such discrimination techniques can enhance both standard model measurements and the ability to search for physics beyond the standard model. Historically the jet shape has been used to test perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations up to the third power in the coupling constant \u03b1 s [7,8]. These leading-order calculations, with only one additional parton in a jet, showed reasonable agreement with the observed jet shapes. While confirming the validity of pQCD calculations, jet shape studies also JHEP06 (2012)160indicated that jet clustering, underlying event contributions, and hadronization effects must be considered. Currently, these effects are modelled within the framework of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, which use QCD parton shower models, in conjunction with hadronization and underlying event models, to generate final-state particles. These MC event generators are used extensively to model the signal and background events for a variety of standard model studies and searches for new physics at hadron colliders. Jet shapes are used to tune phenomenological parameters in the event generators. Jet shapes have been measured previously in pp collisions at the Tevatron [7][8][9][10] and ep collisions at HERA [11][12][13][14][15].",

This algorithm is similar to the well-known k T algorithm, except that it uses 1/p T instead of p T as the weighting factor for the scaled distance. The algorithm is collinear-and infrared-safe, and it produces circular jets in y-\u03c6 space except when jets overlap. Two different types of inputs are used with this algorithm. In the first method, individually calibrated particle candidates are used as inputs to the jet clustering algorithm. These particle candidates, photons, electrons, muons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons, are reconstructed using the CMS particle flow (PF) algorithm [26]. This algorithm combines the information from all the subdetectors including the silicon tracking system, the electromagnetic calorimeter, the hadron calorimeter, and the muon system in order to reconstruct and identify individual particles in an event. The charged-particle information is primarily derived from the tracking system, and the photons are reconstructed using information from the electromagnetic calorimeter. The neutral hadrons, e.g. neutrons and K 0 L mesons, carry on average about 15% of the jet momentum, and are reconstructed using information from the hadron calorimeter. Jets reconstructed from these inputs are referred to as PF jets.",

Tracks originating from the interaction vertex [28] are associated with these calorimeter jets based on the separation in \u03b7-\u03c6 space between the jet direction and track direction at the interaction vertex. In the case of partially overlapping jets, tracks are assigned to the jet with the minimum p T -weighted distance between each track and the jet axis. These tracks are categorized as muon, charged pion, and electron candidates, and the jet momentum is corrected by substituting their expected particle energy deposition in the calorimeter with their momentum. These track-corrected jets are referred to as JPT jets.",

These corrections are derived from GEANT4-based [30] CMS simulations, based on the p T ratio of the particle jet formed from all stable (c\u03c4 > 1 cm) particles to the reconstructed jet, and also in situ measurements using dijet and photon + jet events [29].

The PF jets reconstructed with a distance parameter D = 0.7 are used to measure the jet shapes in the jet p T range 20 GeV/c < p T < 1 TeV/c. Owing to the larger jet size, jet shape measurements evaluate a larger fraction of the momentum from the originating parton and are relatively more sensitive to momentum deposited by multipleparton interactions (MPIs), thus providing important information to tune both the parton showering and MPI models in the event generators. To minimize the contribution from additional pp interactions in a triggered event (pileup), events with only one reconstructed primary vertex are selected for jet shape measurements, as the measurements use both charged and neutral particles. For charged-hadron multiplicity and jet transverse size studies, the events with multiple vertices are also considered as these studies use only those tracks that are associated with the primary vertex.

The data are unfolded to the particle level using binby-bin corrections derived from the CMS simulation based on the pythia 6.4 (pythia6) MC generator [32] tuned to the CMS data (tune Z2). The Z2 tune is identical to the Z1 tune described in [33], except that Z2 uses the CTEQ6L [34] parton distribution function (PDF), while Z1 uses CTEQ5L [35] PDF. The correction factors are determined as functions of r for each jet p T and rapidity bin and vary between 0 and 20%. Since the MC model affects the momentum and angular distributions and flavour composition of particles in a jet, and therefore the simulated detector response to the jet, the unfolding factors depend on the MC model. In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the fragmentation model, the corrections are also derived using pythia8 [36], pythia6 tune D6T [32], and herwig++ [37]. The largest difference of these three sets of correction factors from those of pythia6 tune Z2 is assigned as the uncertainty on the correction. This uncertainty is typically 2-3% in the region where the bulk of the jet energy is deposited and increases to as high as 15% at large radii where the momentum of particles is very small. For very high p T jets where the fraction of jet momentum deposited at large radii is extremely small, the uncertainty is less than 1% at r = 0.1 and reaches 25% at high radii.",

Tune D6T uses virtuality-ordered parton showers, while tune Z2 and the Perugia2010 tune use p T -ordered parton showers. Generator input parameters controlling the underlying event, radiation, and hadronization are tuned in order to provide a better description of collider data. Tune D6T was developed using previous hadron and lepton collider data, while tune Z2 also uses CMS soft p T data [42]. The Perugia2010 tune [41] was tuned using LEP and Tevatron data, notably the CDF jet shape results [9]. Tunes D6T and Z2 are simulated with pythia 6.4.22, and the Perugia2010 tune is simulated with pythia 6.4.24. The CTEQ6L1 [34] parton distribution function (PDF) of the proton is used with tunes D6T and Z2, while the CTEQ5L [35]  Larger values of \u03c1(r) denote larger transverse momentum fraction in a particular annulus. At high jet p T , the data are peaked at low radius r, indicating that jets are highly collimated with most of their p T close to the jet axis while they widen at lower jet p T . For the lowest jet p T bins, the p T distribution within the jet flattens considerably. For 20 GeV/c jets in the central rapidity region, approximately 15% of the jet p T is within a radius of r = 0.1 around the jet axis, whereas at 600 GeV/c this fraction increases to about 90%. This behaviour is illustrated in figures 4 and 5 where the amount of jet energy deposited outside a cone of r = 0.3, 1 \u2212 \u03a8(r = 0.3), is shown as a function of jet p T for central jets and also in six different jet rapidity regions up to |y| = 3. These figures also show comparisons of the data with the pythia6, pythia8, and herwig++ generators.     Statistical uncertainties are shown as error bars on the data points and the shaded region represents the total systematic uncertainty of the measurement. Data points are placed at the bin centre; the horizontal bars show the size of the bin. The ratio of each MC prediction to the data is also shown in the lower part of each plot.",
