This chaos-based, rigorous, non-linear technique is applied to study the erratic behavior of multipion production in \u03c0 \u2212 -Ag/Br interactions at 350 GeV. This method can offer reliable results with finite data points. The Power of Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph denoted by-PSVG is a measure of fractality, which can be used as a quantitative parameter for the assessment of the state of a chaotic system. The event-wise fluctuation of the multipion production process can be described by this parameter-PSVG. From the analysis of the PSVG parameter, we can quantitatively confirm that fractal behavior of the particle production process depends on the target excitation and also the fractality decreases with the increase of target excitation.",

A new method named intermittency was first introduced by Bialas and Peschanski [1], for the the analysis of large fluctuations. The power-law behavior of the factorial moments with respect to the size of phase-space intervals in decreasing mode, has been observed in multipion production in heavy-ion interaction. This has become indicative of self-similar fluctuation in this process.",

Hwa(Gq moment) [2] and Takagi(Tq moment) [6] have developed the most popular of them. Considering their merits and demerits, both these methods have been extensively applied to analyze the multipion emission process [7,8]. Then techniques like the Detrended Fluctuation Fnalysis(DFA) method [9] have been used for determining monofractal scaling parameters and for detecting long-range correlations in noisy and non-stationary time-series data [10,11]. DFA method has been extended by Kantelhardt et al. [12], for analyzing non-stationary and multifractal time-series. This generalized DFA is known as the multifractal-DFA(MF-DFA) method.",

            "text": "If the time-series, say denoted by x(i) for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , shows long-range(power-law) correlation, the the DFA function, say denoted by F (s) follows a power-law relationship with the scale parameter, say denoted by s, as per the equation F (s) \u221d s H . This exponent H is popularly known as Hurst exponent which is again related with the fractal dimension, denoted by D F , as per the relationship D F = 2\u2212H [13]. The extended version of DFA method called MF-DFA [12] technique has been introduced for this kind of analysis, for its advantage of having highest precision. Hurst exponent and MF-DFA parameter are used extensively in nonlinear, non-stationary analysis and they have been successful in identifying long-range correlations for different time series. Zhang et al. [14] applied MF-DFA method to analyze the multifractal structure of the distribution of shower particles around central rapidity region of Au-Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200A GeV. Multifractal analysis in particle production processes has been done in various works of recent times [15,16,17]. We have done fractal and multifractal analysis of the fluctuations of multipion production process in various types of high energy collisions [7,18,19,16], various other kinds of time series formed from natural signals like audio signals [20,21] and biological signals like EEG and ECG signals [22,23,24]. However both these methods give most accurate results for random processes like Brownian motion where the time-series has an infinite number of data points. But in real-life situations we hardly get infinite number of data points and end up using finite number of data points for calculation of the Hurst exponent, the MF-DFA parameter. In this process the long-range correlations in the time series are fractionally broken into finite number of data points and the local dynamics relating to a particular temporal window are obviously overestimated.",

Havlin et al. have discussed the application of network sciences to the description, analysis, understanding, design and repair of multi-level complex systems which occur in man-made and human social systems, in organic and inorganic matter, from nano to macro scales, and in natural and anthropogenic structures [27]. Zhao et al. have investigated the dynamics of stock market by means of correlation-based network and identified global expansion and local clustering market behaviors during crises, using the heterogeneous time scales [28]. In this regard, Visibility Graph analysis [29,30] method has gained importance due its entirely different, rigorous approach. Lacasa et al. have used fractional Brownian motion(fBm) and fractional Gaussian noises(fGn) series as a theoretical framework to analyse real-time series in different scientific fields. The Hurst parameter calculated for fBm with different methods, often yields ambiguous results, because of the presence of inherent non-stationarity and long-range dependence in fBm. Lacasa et al. applied classic method of complex network analysis to quantify long-range dependence and fractality of a time series [30] and mapped fBm and fGn series into a scale-free Visibility Graph having the degree distribution as a function of the Hurst exponent [30]. Zhao et al. have applied both MF-DFA and Visibility graph method to investigate the fluctuation and geometrical structures of magnetization time series and confirmed that Hurst exponent is a good indicator of phase transition for a complex system [31]. Visibility Graph analysis is altogether a new concept to estimate fractality from a new perspective without estimating multifractality. Moreover this method has recently been applied widely over time series with finite number of data points, even with 400 data points [32], and has achieved reliable result in various fields of science. This method has been used productively for analyzing various biological signals in recent works [33,34,35,36].",

It should be noted that the number of grey particles, normally denoted by n g , provides an indirect measurement of the impact or collision centrality. This centrality increases with the count of grey particles. Generally speaking, n g along can be considered as the measure of violence of target fragmentation [37]. So it would be interesting to analyze the behavior of pion with respect to n g to gather more information about the inner dynamics of the particle production process in high-energy nuclear collision. The behavior of pion with respect to n g or the number of target fragments provides more insight about the chaotic behavior of the pions in multipion production process. In this work we have applied Visibility graph analysis to study the fractal behavior of multipion production in \u03c0 \u2212 -Ag/Br interactions at 350 GeV with respect to target excitation. As finite number of events are available here, use of Visibility graph technique is justified.",

The degree of a node in a graph -here Visibility graph, is the number of connections or edges the node has, with rest of the nodes in the graph. The degree distribution P (k) of a network is then defined as the fraction of nodes with degree k, present in the network. Hence if there are n nodes in total in a network and n k of them have degree k, we have P (k) = n k /n for all values of k. As per Lacasa et al. [29,30] and Ahmadlou et al. [38], the degree of scale-freeness of a Visibility Graph corresponds to the amount of fractality and complexity of the time series. According to the scale-freeness property of Visibility Graph, the degree distribution of its nodes follow power-law, i,e, P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03bbp , where \u03bb p is a constant and it is called the Power of the Scale-freeness in Visibility Graph-PSVG.
