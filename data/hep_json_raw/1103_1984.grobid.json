In this Letter a search is performed at the ATLAS experiment for slow-moving charged particles produced in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV centre-ofmass energy at the LHC, using a data-set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb \u22121 . No deviations from Standard Model expectations are found. This result is interpreted in a framework of supersymmetry models in which coloured sparticles can hadronise into long-lived bound hadronic states, termed R-hadrons, and 95% CL limits are set on the production cross-sections of squarks and gluinos. The influence of R-hadron interactions in matter was studied using a number of different models, and lower mass limits for stable sbottoms and stops are found to be 294 and 309 GeV respectively. The lower mass limit for a stable gluino lies in the range from 562 to 586 GeV depending on the model assumed. Each of these constraints is the most stringent to date.",

            "text": "The discovery of exotic stable massive particles (SMPs) 1 at the LHC would be of fundamental significance. The motivation for SMP searches at ATLAS arises, for example, from proposed solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem, which involve previously unseen particles with TeV-scale masses [1,2]. The ATLAS experiment has recently searched for SMPs with large electric charge [3]. SMPs possessing colour charge represent another class of exotic particle which can be sought. Hadronising SMPs are anticipated in a wide range of exotic physics models [1] that extend the Standard Model (SM). For example, these particles appear in both R-parity conserving supersymmetry (SUSY) and universal extra dimensions. The possibility of direct pair production through the strong nuclear force implies large production cross-sections. Searches for these particles are thus an important component of the early data exploitation programs of the LHC experiments [4]. In this Letter, the first limits from the ATLAS experiment are presented on the production of coloured, hadronising SMPs in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy at the LHC. Results are presented in the context of SUSY models pre-\u2729 \u00a9 CERN, for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration.

Previous searches for R-hadrons have typically been based on either the signature of a highly ionising particle in an inner tracking system [7][8][9] or a slow-moving muon-like object [9][10][11]. The latter limits rely on the assumption that the R-hadron is electrically charged when it leaves the calorimeter and can thus be detected in an outer muon system. However, hadronic scattering of R-hadrons in the dense calorimeter material, and the properties of different mass hierarchies for the R-hadrons, may render most of the produced R-hadrons electrically neutral in the muon system [12]. Such an effect is expected for R-hadrons formed from sbottom-like squarks [13]; the situation for gluino-based Rhadrons is unclear, with different models giving rise to different phenomenologies. The previous mass limit for gluino R-hadrons with minimal sensitivity to scattering uncertainties is 311 GeV at 95% confidence level [9] from the CMS Collaboration. 2 A small fraction of SMPs can be brought to rest by interactions in the detector.",

Two complementary subsystems used in this work are the pixel detector, which measures ionisation energy loss (dE/dx), and the tile calorimeter, which measures the time-of-flight from the interaction point for particles which traverse it. Furthermore, since there is no requirement that a candidate be reconstructed in the outer muon spectrometer, the search is robust to theoretical uncertainties on the fraction of R-hadrons that are charged when leaving the calorimeter system. The analysis extends the mass limits beyond already published limits and represents the first dedicated direct search for sbottom R-hadrons at a hadron collider.",

The string hadronisation model [17], incorporating specialised hadronisation routines [1] is used to produce final states containing R-hadrons. For gluino scenarios the probability for a gluino to form a gluon-gluino bound state, based on a colour octet model, is assumed to be 10% [1]. The simulation of R-hadron interactions in matter is handled by dedicated Geant4 routines [18,19] based on three different models with alternative assumptions. R-hadrons containing squarks are simulated using the model described in Ref. [13]. This model is motivated by extrapolations from SM heavy quark hadron spectra. It furthermore employs a triple-Regge formalism to describe hadronic scattering. For gluino R-hadrons there are less strict theoretical constraints since no SM analogue exists for a heavy colour octet. Consequently a physics model is chosen, as described in Refs. [20,21]. This model has been used in other publications [6,9,22] and it imposes few constraints on allowed stable states. Doubly charged R-hadrons and a wide variety of charge reversal signatures in the detector are possible. Hadronic scattering is described through a purely phase space driven approach. More recent models for the hadronic scattering of gluino R-hadrons predict that the majority of all produced R-hadrons will be electrically neutral after just a few hadronic interactions. One of these models is an extension of the triple-Regge model used to describe squark R-hadrons [12]. Another is the bag-model based calculation presented in Ref. [23]. Independent results for gluino R-hadrons are presented here for these models.",

All cells along the particle trajectory with an energy deposition larger than 500 MeV are used to make an independent estimate of \u03b2. The time resolution has been shown to improve with the energy measured in the cell [29], so the cells are combined using an average weighted by cell energy to get a velocity measurement (\u03b2 Tile ).

Final states with R-hadrons can also contain jets and missing transverse energy (E miss T ) arising from QCD radiation which can be used to select candidate events. Due to the large cross-section for jet production at the LHC, triggering on jets with low transverse energy is not feasible. A superior trigger efficiency for the signal is obtained by using a trigger on missing transverse energy utilising only calorimeter information [30] (a full description of the ATLAS trigger system is given in [26]). Using an E miss T -based trigger is possible since R-hadrons would typically deposit only a small fraction of their energy as they propagate through the ATLAS calorimeters. The trigger threshold applied is E miss T = 40 GeV which gives an efficiency ranging from approximately 15% for a gluino-mass of 100 GeV to 32% for a 600 GeV mass. The missing transverse energy trigger is based on a level-1 trigger decision derived from coarsely segmented energy measurements, followed by a decision at the higher-level trigger based on the full granularity of the ATLAS calorimeter. Table 1 shows the cut flow of the analysis. After the trigger selection, each event is required to contain a track with a transverse momentum greater than 10 GeV. This track must be matched either to a muon reconstructed in the muon spectrometer or to a cluster in the tile calorimeter. The track is required to have MIPcompatible energy depositions in the calorimeter. Such an event is referred to in the table as a candidate event. Each event is required to contain at least one good primary vertex, to which at least three tracks are associated. Only tracks in the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7) are considered. This matches the acceptance of the tile calorimeter. To ensure well measured kinematics, track quality requirements are made: the track must have at least two hits in the pixel detector, at least six hits in the silicon-strip Semiconductor Tracker, and at least six associated hits in the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Jet objects are reconstructed using the anti-k t jet clustering algorithm [31,32] with a distance parameter of 0.4. In order to suppress backgrounds from jet production, the distance in \u03b7-\u03c6 space between the candidate and any jet with E T 40 GeV must be greater than R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.5. Finally, the measured transverse momentum of the candidate must be greater than 50 GeV.",

[24]. This leads to a broadly mass-independent uncertainty of \u223c 15% in the event yield. When substituting the MSTW 2008 NLO PDF set [33] for CTEQ 6.6 a variation of less than 5% is observed.

Candidate R-hadrons were sought which left a high transverse momentum track associated with energy depositions in the calorimeter. Observables sensitive to R-hadron speed (ionisation energy loss and time-of-flight) were used to suppress backgrounds and allow the reconstruction of the candidate mass. The influence of the scattering of R-hadrons in matter on the search sensitivity was studied using a range of phenomenological scattering models. At 95% confidence level the most conservative lower limits on the masses of stable sbottoms, stops and gluinos are 294, 309, and 562 GeV, respectively. Each of these limits are the most stringent to date. ",

This indicates that fluctuations in the excluded cross-section will occur. The mass limits quoted in the text are inferred by comparing the cross-section limits with the model predictions. Systematic uncertainties from the choice of PDF and the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales are represented as a band in the cross-section curves. Previous mass limits are indicated by shaded vertical lines for sbottom (ALEPH), stop (CDF) and gluino (CMS).",
