The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution (\u00c1p=p) that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \"m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). The impact parameter is defined as the distance of closest approach of a given particle to the primary pp interaction vertex (PV). Charged particles are identified by two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [24]. Discrimination of photons, electrons and charged hadrons is provided by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.
