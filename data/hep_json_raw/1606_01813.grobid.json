Measurements of the photon identification efficiencies are reported, using 4.9 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected at the LHC at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The efficiencies are measured separately for converted and unconverted photons, in four different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta between 10 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The results from the combination of three data-driven techniques are compared to the predictions from a simulation of the detector response, after correcting the electromagnetic shower momenta in the simulation for the average differences observed with respect to data. Data-to-simulation efficiency ratios used as correction factors in physics measurements are determined to account for the small residual efficiency differences. These factors are measured with uncertainties between 0.5% and 10% in 7 TeV data and between 0.5% and 5.6% in 8 TeV data, depending on the photon transverse momentum and pseudorapidity.",

            "text": "Several physics processes occurring in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produce final states with prompt photons, i.e. photons not originating from hadron decays. The main contributions come from nonresonant production of photons in association with jets or of photon pairs, with cross sections respectively of the order of tens of nanobarns or picobarns [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The study of such final states, and the measurement of their production cross sections, are of great interest as they probe the perturbative regime of QCD and can provide useful information about the parton distribution functions of the proton [7]. Prompt photons are also produced in rarer processes that are key to the LHC physics programme, such as diphoton decays of the Higgs boson discovered with a mass near 125 GeV, produced with a cross section times branching ratio of about 20 fb at \u221a s = 8 TeV [8]. Finally, some expected signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) are characterised by the presence of prompt photons in the final state. These include resonant photon pairs from graviton decays in models with extra spatial dimensions [9], pairs of photons accompanied by large missing transverse momentum produced in the decays of pairs of supersymmetric particles [10] and events with highly energetic photons and jets from decays of excited quarks or other exotic scenarios [11].",

An estimate of the efficiency of the photon identification criteria can be obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Such an estimate, however, is subject to large, O(10%), systematic uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from limited knowledge of the detector material, from an imperfect description of the shower development and from the detector response [1]. Ultimately, for high-precision measurements and for accurate comparisons with the predictions from the SM or from theories beyond the SM, a determination of the photon identification efficiency with an uncertainty of O(1%) or smaller is needed in a large energy range from 10 GeV to several TeV. This can only be achieved through the use of data control samples. However, this can present several difficulties since there is no single physics process that produces a pure sample of prompt photons in a large transverse momentum (E T ) range.",

The innermost part of the ID consists of a silicon pixel detector (50.5 mm < r < 150 mm) providing typically three measurement points for charged particles originating in the beam-interaction region. The layer closest to the beam pipe (referred to as the b-layer in this paper) contributes significantly to precision vertexing and provides discrimination between prompt tracks and photon conversions. A semiconductor tracker (SCT) consisting of modules with two layers of silicon microstrip sensors surrounds the pixel detector, providing typically eight hits per track at intermediate radii (275 mm < r < 560 mm). The outermost region of the ID (563 mm < r < 1066 mm) is covered by a transition radiation tracker (TRT) consisting of straw drift tubes filled with a xenon gas mixture, interleaved with polypropylene/polyethylene transition radiators. For charged particles with transverse momentum p T > 0.5 GeV within its pseudorapidity coverage (|\u03b7| 2), the TRT pro-1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the zaxis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

The distinction between transition radiation (low-energy photons emitted by electrons traversing the radiators) and tracking signals is obtained on a straw-by-straw basis using separate low and high thresholds in the front-end electronics. The inner detector allows an accurate reconstruction and transverse momentum measurement of tracks from the primary proton-proton collision region. It also identifies tracks from secondary vertices, permitting the efficient reconstruction of photon conversions up to a radial distance of about 80 cm from the beamline. The solenoid is surrounded by a high-granularity lead/ liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter with an accordion geometry. The EM calorimeter measures the energy and the position of electromagnetic showers with |\u03b7| < 3.2. It is divided into a barrel section, covering the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 1.475, and two end-cap sections, covering the pseudorapidity regions 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The transition region between the barrel and the end-caps, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, has a large amount of material upstream of the first active calorimeter layer. The EM calorimeter is composed, for |\u03b7| < 2.5, of three sampling layers, longitudinal in shower depth. The first layer has a thickness of about 4.4 radiation lengths (X 0 ). In the ranges |\u03b7| < 1.4 and 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.4, the first layer is segmented into highgranularity strips in the \u03b7 direction, with a typical cell size of 0.003\u00d70.0982 in \u03b7\u00d7 \u03c6 in the barrel. For 1.4 < |\u03b7| < 1.5 and 2.4 < |\u03b7| < 2.5 the \u03b7-segmentation of the first layer is coarser, and the cell size is \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.025 \u00d7 0.0982. The fine \u03b7 granularity of the strips is sufficient to provide, for transverse momenta up to O(100 GeV), an event-by-event discrimination between single photon showers and two overlapping showers coming from the decays of neutral hadrons, mostly \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons, in jets in the fiducial pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.37. The second layer has a thickness of about 17 X 0 and a granularity of 0.025 \u00d7 0.0245 in \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6. It collects most of the energy deposited in the calorimeter by photon and electron showers. The third layer has a granularity of 0.05 \u00d7 0.0245 in \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 and a depth of about 2 X 0 . It is used to correct for leakage beyond the EM calorimeter of high-energy showers. In front of the accordion calorimeter, a thin presampler layer, covering the pseudorapidity interval |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for energy loss upstream of the calorimeter. The presampler consists of an active LAr layer with a thickness of 1.1 cm (0.5 cm) in the barrel (end-cap) and has a granularity of \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.025\u00d70.0982. The material upstream of the presampler has a thickness of about 2 X 0 for |\u03b7| < 0.6. In the region 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 0.8 this thickness increases linearly from 2 X 0 to 3 X 0 . For 0.8 < |\u03b7| < 1.8 the material thickness is about or slightly larger than 3 X 0 , with the exception of the transition region between the barrel and the end-caps and the region near |\u03b7| = 1.7, where it reaches 5-6 X 0 .

The reconstruction efficiencies of photons with transverse momenta of a few tens of GeV (relevant for the search for Higgs boson decays to two photons) are checked in data with a technique described in Ref. [20]. The results point to inefficiencies and fake rates that exceed by up to a few percent the predictions from MC simulation. The efficiency to reconstruct photon conversions decreases at high E T (>150 GeV), where it becomes more difficult to separate the two tracks from the conversions. Such conversions with very close-by tracks are often not recovered as single-track conversions because of the tighter selections, including the transition radiation requirement, applied to single-track conversion candidates. The overall photon reconstruction efficiency is thus reduced to about 90% for E T around 1 TeV. The final photon energy measurement is performed using information from the calorimeter, with a cluster size that depends on the photon classification. 3 In the barrel, a cluster of size \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.075 \u00d7 0.123 is used for unconverted photon candidates, while a cluster of size 0.075 \u00d7 0.172 is used for converted photon candidates to compensate for the opening between the conversion products in the \u03c6 direction due to the magnetic field of the ATLAS solenoid.

Photon identification in ATLAS is based on a set of cuts on several discriminating variables. Such variables, listed in Table 1 and described in Appendix A, characterise the lateral and longitudinal shower development in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the shower leakage fraction in the hadronic calorimeter. Prompt photons typically produce narrower energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and have smaller leakage to the hadronic one compared to background photons from jets, due to the presence of additional hadrons near the photon candidate in the latter case. In addition, background candidates from isolated \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decays -unlike prompt photons -are often characterised by two separate local energy maxima in the finely segmented strips of the first layer, due to the small separation between the two photons. The distributions of the discriminating variables for both the prompt and background photons are affected by additional soft pp interactions that may accompany the hard-scattering collision, referred to as in-time pile-up, as well as by out-of-time pileup arising from bunches before or after the bunch where the event of interest was triggered. Pile-up results in the presence of low-E T activity in the detector, including energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter. This effect tends to broaden the distributions of the discriminating variables and thus to reduce the separation between prompt and background photon candidates. Two reference selections, a loose one and a tight one, are defined. The loose selection is based only on shower shapes in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter and on the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter, and is used by the photon triggers. The loose requirements are designed to provide a high prompt-photon identification efficiency with respect to reconstruction. Their efficiency rises from 97% at E \u03b3 T = 20 GeV to above 99% for E \u03b3 T > 40 GeV for both the converted and unconverted photons, and the corresponding background rejection factor is about 1000 [19]. The rejection factor is defined as the ratio of the number of initial jets with p T > 40 GeV in the acceptance of the calorimeter to the number of reconstructed background photon candidates satisfying the identification criteria. The tight selection adds information from the finely segmented strip layer of the calorimeter, which provides good rejection of hadronic jets where a neutral meson carries most of the jet energy. The tight criteria are separately optimised for unconverted and converted photons to provide a photon identifi-cation efficiency of about 85% for photon candidates with transverse energy E T > 40 GeV and a corresponding background rejection factor of about 5000 [19].",

Before the 2011 data-taking, the loose and the tight selections were loosened, without further re-optimisation, in order to reduce the systematic effects associated to the differences between the calorimetric variables measured from data and their description by the ATLAS simulation. Prior to the 8 TeV run in 2012, the identification criteria were reoptimised based on improved simulations in which the values of the shower shape variables are slightly shifted to improve the agreement with the data shower shapes, as described in the next section. To cope with the higher pileup expected during the 2012 data taking, the criteria on the shower shapes more sensitive to pile-up were relaxed while the others were tightened.",

The underlying event and pile-up energy correction is computed on an event-by-event basis using the method described in Refs. [24,25]. A k T jet-finding algorithm [26,27] of size parameter R = 0.5 is used to reconstruct all jets without any explicit transverse momentum threshold, starting from the three-dimensional topological clusters reconstructed in the calorimeter. Each jet is assigned an area A jet via a Voronoi tessellation [28] of the \u03b7-\u03c6 space. According to this algorithm, every point within a jet's assigned area is closer to the axis of that jet than to the axis of any other jet. The ambient transverse energy density \u03c1 UE (\u03b7) from pile-up and the underlying event is taken to be the median of the transverse energy densities p jet T /A jet of jets with pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.5 or 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.0. The area of the photon isolation cone is then multiplied by \u03c1 UE to compute the correction to E iso T .

The typical size of the correction is 2 GeV in the central region and 1.5 GeV in the forward region.",

The MC samples are reweighted to reproduce the distribution of \u03bc and the length of the luminous region observed in data (approximately 54 cm and 48 cm in the data taken at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively). Samples of prompt pho-tons are generated with PYTHIA8 [32,33]. Such samples include the leading-order \u03b3 + jet events from qg \u2192 q\u03b3 and qq \u2192 g\u03b3 hard scattering, as well as prompt photons from quark fragmentation in QCD dijet events. About 10 7 events are generated, covering the whole transverse momentum spectrum under study. Samples of background photons in jets are produced by generating with PYTHIA8 all tree-level 2\u21922 QCD processes, removing \u03b3 + jet events from quark fragmentation. Between 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 and 5 \u00d7 10 6 Z \u2192 \u03b3 ( = e, \u03bc) events are generated with SHERPA [34] or with POWHEG [35,36] interfaced to PHOTOS [37] for the modelling of QED final-state radiation and to PYTHIA8 for showering, hadronisation and modelling of the underlying event. About 10 7 Z (\u2192 )+jet events are generated for both = e and = \u03bc with each of the following three event generators: POWHEG interfaced to PYTHIA8; ALPGEN [38] interfaced to HERWIG [39] and JIMMY [40] for showering, hadronisation and modelling of the underlying event; and SHERPA. A sample of MC H \u2192 Z \u03b3 events [41] is also used to compute the efficiency in the simulation for photons with transverse momentum between 10 and 15 GeV, since the Z \u2192 \u03b3 samples have a generator-level requirement on the minimum true photon transverse momentum of 10 GeV which biases the reconstructed transverse momentum near the threshold. A two-dimensional reweighting of the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum spectra of the photons is applied to match the distributions of those reconstructed in Z \u2192 \u03b3 events. For the analysis of \u221a s = 7 TeV data, all simulated samples (photon+jet, QCD multi-jet, Z (\u2192 )+jet and Z \u2192 \u03b3 ) are generated with PYTHIA6.",

The differences between the data and MC distributions are parameterised as simple shifts and applied to the MC simulated values to match the distributions in data. These shifts are calculated by minimising the \u03c7 2 between the data and the shifted MC distributions of photon candidates satisfying the tight identification criteria and the calorimeter isolation requirement described in the previous section.

The data are fit to a sum of the photon and background contributions. The photon and background m \u03b3 distributions (\"templates\") are extracted from the Z \u2192 \u03b3 and Z +jet simulations, corrected to take into account known data-MC differences in the photon and lepton energy scales and resolution and in the lep- ton efficiencies. The signal and background yields are determined from the data by maximising the likelihood. Due to the small number of selected events in data and simulation, these fits are performed only for two photon transverse momentum intervals, 10 GeV < E T < 15 GeV and E T > 15 GeV, and integrated over the photon pseudorapidity, since the signal purity is found to be similar in the four photon |\u03b7| intervals within statistical uncertainties.

For the measurement of \u03b5 B all , the control sample of all photon candidates not meeting at least one of the tight identification criteria is used. In order to obtain \u03b5 B pass , a relaxed version of the tight identification criteria is defined. The relaxed tight selection consists of those candidates which fail at least one of the requirements on four discriminating variables computed from the energy in the cells of the first EM calorimeter layer (F side , w s3 , E, E ratio ), but satisfy the remaining tight identification criteria. The four variables which are removed from the tight selection to define the relaxed tight one are computed from the energy deposited in a few strips of the first compartment of the LAr EM calorimeter near the one with the largest deposit and are chosen since they have negligible correlations with the photon isolation. Due to the very small correlation (few %) between the track isolation and these discriminating variables, the backgroundphoton track isolation efficiency is similar for photons satisfying tight or relaxed tight criteria. The differences between the track isolation efficiencies for background photons satisfying tight or relaxed tight criteria are included in the systematic uncertainties. The contamination from prompt photons in the background enriched samples is accounted for in this procedure by using as an additional input the fraction of signal events passing or failing the relaxed tight requirements, as determined from the prompt-photon simulation. The fraction of prompt photons in the background control samples decreases from about 20% to 1%, with increasing photon transverse momentum. The whole procedure is tested with a simulated sample of \u03b3 +jet and dijet events, and the difference between the true track isolation efficiency for background photons and the one estimated with this procedure is taken as a systematic uncertainty. An additional systematic uncertainty, due to the use of the prompt-photon simulation to estimate the fraction of signal photons in the background control regions, is estimated by re-calculating these fractions using alternative MC samples based on a detector simulation with a conservative estimate of additional material in front of the calorimeter.

From these measurements the photon identification efficiency is derived, according to Eq. (3). The track isolation efficiency for prompt-photon candidates is essentially independent of the photon transverse momentum. For background candidates, the track isolation efficiency initially decreases with E T , since candidates with larger E T are produced from more energetic jets, which are therefore characterised by a larger number of tracks near the photon candidate. At higher transverse energies, typically above 200 GeV, the boost of such tracks causes some of them to fall within the inner cone ( R < 0.1) of the isolation cone around the photon and the isolation efficiency for background candidates therefore increases.",

The combination is performed independently in the different pseudorapidity and transverse energy bins, using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) method [45,46]. The combined data-to-MC efficiency ratio SF is calculated as a linear combination of the input measurements, SF i , with coefficients w i that minimise the total uncertainty in the combined result. In the algorithm, both the statistical and systematic uncertainties, as well as the correlations of systematic sources between input measurements, are taken into account assuming that all uncertainties have Gaussian distributions. In practice, the quantity that is minimised is a \u03c7 2 built from the various results and their statistical and systematic covariance matrices. Since the three measurements use different data samples and independent MC simulations, their systematic and statistical uncertainties are largely uncorrelated.

Such thresholds were first determined using simulated samples prior to the 2010 data-taking and then loosened in order to reduce the observed inefficiency and the systematic uncertainties arising from the differences found between the distributions of the discriminating variables in data and in the simulation. The efficiency of the identification algorithms used for the analysis of the 7 TeV data is measured with the same techniques described in Sect. 5. Small differences between the 7 and 8 TeV measurements concern the simulated samples that were used, and the criteria used to select the data control samples. The 7 TeV simulations are based on a different detector material model, as described in Sect. 4; the number of simulated pile-up interactions and the correction factors for the lepton efficiency and momentum scale and resolution also differ from those of the 8 TeV study, as do the lepton triggers and the algorithms used to identify the leptons in data. Due to the smaller number of events, the 7 TeV measurements cover a narrower transverse momentum  range, 20 GeV < E T < 250 GeV. The nominal efficiency is measured with respect to photons having a calorimeter isolation transverse energy lower than 5 GeV, a typical requirement used in 7 TeV ATLAS measurements. The isolation energy is computed using all the calorimeter cells in a cone of R = 0.4 around the photon and corrected for pile-up and the photon energy. The number of selected candidates is 12000 in the Z \u2192 \u03b3 study, 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 in the Z \u2192 ee one, and 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 in the measurement with the matrix method. All data-driven measurements are combined using the same procedure described in Sect. 6.2 for the scale factors, and then compared to a simulation of prompt-photon+jet events. In the combination, the differences between the efficiencies of photons from radiative Z boson decays and of photons from \u03b3 +jet events mentioned in Sect. 6.2 are neglected. Such differences after the photon isolation requirement are estimated to be much smaller than the uncertainties of the measurements performed with the \u221a s = 7 TeV data. The combined efficiency measurements for the cut-based identification algorithms at \u221a s = 7 TeV are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. The identification efficiency increases from 60-70% for E T = 20 GeV to 87-95% (90-99%) for E T > 100 GeV for unconverted (converted) photons. The uncertainty in the efficiency and on the data-to-MC efficiency ratios decreases from 3-10% at low E T to about 0.5-5% for E T > 100 GeV, being typically larger at higher |\u03b7|.",

With an optimised neural network this efficiency increases from 85-90% at E T = 20 GeV to about 97% (99%) at E T > 100 GeV for unconverted (converted) photon candidates for a similar background rejection. For the data taken in 2012, 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, the efficiency of a re-optimised cut-based photon identification algorithm increases from 50-65% (45-55%) for unconverted (converted) photons at E T = 10 GeV to 95-100% at E T > 100 GeV, being larger than \u224890% for E T > 40 GeV. The nominal MC simulation of prompt photons in ATLAS predicts significantly higher identification efficiency values than those measured in some regions of the phase space, particularly at low E T . A simulation with shower shapes corrected for the average shifts observed with respect to the data describes the values of \u03b5 ID better in the entire E T and \u03b7 range accessible by the data-driven methods. The residual difference between the efficiencies in data and in the corrected simulation are taken into account by computing datato-MC efficiency scale factors. These factors differ from one by up to 10% at E T = 10 GeV and by only a few percents above E T = 40 GeV, with an uncertainty decreasing from 1.4-4.5% (1.7-5.6%) at E T = 10 GeV for unconverted (converted) photons to 0.2-0.8% (0.2-0.5%) at high E T for \u221a s = 8 TeV. The uncertainties are slightly larger for \u221a s = 7 TeV data due to the smaller size of the control samples.
