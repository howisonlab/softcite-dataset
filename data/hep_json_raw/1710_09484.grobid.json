We discuss inclusive searches in dijets and bjets, as well as searches in semi-inclusive events by requiring an additional lepton that increases sensitivity to different aspects of the underlying processes. We discuss the expected exclusion limits for generic models predicting new massive particles that result in resonant structures in the dijet mass. Prospects of the Higher-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) collider are also discussed. The study is based on the Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator using representative event statistics for the HL-LHC and HE-LHC running conditions. The event samples were created using supercomputers at NERSC.",

This is related to the fact that the collection of inclusive dijet events with dijet masses of the order of hundreds of GeV is reduced (or \"pre-scaled\") at the trigger level in order to cope with a large rate of multijet QCD events. Focusing on the tail of dijet-mass distributions (M jj ), rather than on the data in the region close to the electroweak (EWK) scale, < 1 TeV, limits the potential of searches in inclusive dijet masses below 1 TeV.",

This can lead to detailed studies of dijets at relatively low masses (0.1 < M jj < 1 TeV), while reducing contributions from QCD multijet events, which represent the main background for inclusive dijet mass searches. The multijet QCD background can further be reduced for dijets where one or two jets are tagged as b\u2212jet. High-precision searches focusing on the medium range of invariant masses in semiinclusive final states was discussed in [7] in the context of a broad class of Hidden Valleys models [8], in which new particles can be as light as the Standard Model (SM) particles, i.e. with masses below 1 TeV.",

This amount of data opens a new chapter in BSM searches focusing on extraction of features in M jj distributions where the relative statistical uncertainty (i.e. statistical uncertainty expressed as a fraction of data point value) can be as small as 10 \u22124 -10 \u22123 near M jj = 0.1 TeV as shown in this paper.

In the searched mass region from \u223c 0.1 to 10 (20) TeV at the HL-LHC (HE-LHC), event rates fall by more than 14 orders of magnitude. Modeling mis-identification rates of leptons and b\u2212jets in this large range of invariant masses is challenging since it requires certain experiment-motivated assumptions that can numerically be implemented in MC simulations, as well as an analysis of large event samples from MC generators that include parton showers and hadronization. We will discuss this topic using realistic MC event samples, creation of which has become possible with the use of high-performance computing. In addition, we will calculate the exclusion limits for BSM models predicting heavy particles decaying to two jets at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC. The limits will be calculated using MC simulations of inclusive dijets, b-jets and dijets associated with a lepton.",

The comparison of the Gaussian shape with the signal shape from the Z \u2032 decays in Pythia8 is shown in Fig. 3. The generated masses of the Z \u2032 particles are given by the Breit-Wigner distribution, but the M jj distributions are asymmetric, which are typical for reconstructed dijet masses using realistic jet algorithms (note the logarithmic scale used for this figure). Alternatively, exclusion limits were calculated using the CL s method with a binned profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic using the HistFitter framework [22]. The expected limits on the signal model are calculated by using an asymptotic approximation [23]. Figure 4 shows the 95% C.L. upper limits. The green and yellow bands represent the 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 probability intervals around the expected limit. The obtained limits are found to be rather similar to the Gaussian limits (without the requirement |y * | < 0.6) obtained above, despite the difference in the signal shape. Unlike the Gaussian limits, the HistFitter limits were calculated starting from M jj > 1 TeV. Below this value, the HistFitter technique produces an unstable result caused by fluctuations in the M jj distribution after the extrapolation of the low-statistics histogram to the required luminosity (see Sect. II).",

            "text": "The previous studies of inclusive dijets represent a hypothetical scenario that may never be realized in practice due to difficulties [24] in analyzing data with trigger prescales applied to jets at medium p T . However, measurements of unbiased M jj distributions (below 1 TeV) can be made possible by using an independent object to trigger on. For example, to reduce the impact of the very high rate of multi-jet background, at the price of requiring associated production, one can require an isolated muon, electron or other particle. To illustrate a scenario with lepton mis-identifications, let us now turn to the case with muons. Figure 8(b) shows the M jj distribution with isolated muons, including contributions from jets which are mis-identified as muons. The mi-identification rate is set to 0.1% as discussed in Sect. III. According to Fig. 8(b), the fraction of W/Z/H 0 /top processes is 1.2% to the total event rate, which is a factor of ten larger than for the inclusive dijets shown in Fig. 1. Figure 8(a) and (b) shows that the contribution from EWK and top processes to the total event rate strongly depends on the mis-identification rates for leptons. For   As for the previous sections, our goal is to give expectations for exclusion limits at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC using assumed muon fake rates, without discussing the cross sections for particular exotic models predicting enhancements in dijet masses. The 95% credibilitylevel upper limits for a signal for the muon-associated dijet production, assuming 0.1% mis-identification rate, are shown in Fig. 9. The signal was approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose width is 10% of the mass of the searched resonance. The figure shows the expectations for the HL-LHC and HE-LHC. Figure 10 shows the 95% credibility-level upper limits for a Z \u2032 signal comparing 100 fb \u22121 from the LHC with the HL-LHC luminosity scenario.",

This point may depend on the assumption used for the fake rate and the efficiency discussed in Sect. III, but the difference between different luminosity scenarios should not depend much on these assumptions. Figure 15 shows the mass reach for the HL-LHC and HE-LHC. For the modest luminosity of 100 fb \u22121 , the mass reach at the HE-LHC is above 13 TeV, which is a factor of two larger than for the HL-LHC, assuming that the reconstructed efficiencies and fake rates for b-jets are similar for the HE-LHC and HL-LHC.

A similar good agreement between data and the fit function was shown in the previous studies [2,3,6] that used smaller integrated luminosities. When using the same integrated luminosity as in Ref. [2,3,6], no statistical deviations from the fit function were found. The quality of the fit was given by \u03c7 2 /ndf = 0.9. Figure 19 shows the mass of two jets associated with isolated muons together with the fit of Eq. 1 for the HL-LHC case. In addition to the high-mass region, the figure shows the fit results for 0.125 < M jj < 1 TeV. This scenario is relevant for semi-inclusive searches using an additional trigger requirement on leptons, and other triggered particles. The function does describe the low-mass and high-mass regions in Pythia8, even when the fit was performed separately in these two mass windows. This can be seen from the quoted \u03c7 2 /ndf value, and Therefore, the oscillatory behavior of S i after the \u03c7 2 minimization is a reflection of differences between the shape of the M jj distribution in Pythia8 and the analytic function, rather than a consequence of the presence of oscillations in the simulated data.",
