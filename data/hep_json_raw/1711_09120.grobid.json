The analysis exploits two customized topological trigger algorithms, and uses the multiplicity of displaced jets to search for the presence of a signal decay occurring at distances between 1 and 1000 mm. The results can be interpreted in a variety of different models. For pair-produced long-lived particles decaying to two b quarks and two leptons with equal decay rates between lepton flavors, cross sections larger than 2.5 fb are excluded for proper decay lengths between 70-100 mm for a long-lived particle mass of 1130 GeV at 95% confidence. For a specific model of pair-produced, long-lived top squarks with R-parity violating decays to a b quark and a lepton, masses below 550-1130 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence for equal branching fractions between lepton flavors, depending on the squark decay length. This mass bound is the most stringent to date for top squark proper decay lengths greater than 3 mm.",

With no signal yet observed, these experiments have placed stringent bounds on BSM models. The majority of these searches focus on particles with lab frame decay lengths of c\u03c4 < 1 mm and incorporate selection requirements that reject longer-lived particle decays. This leaves open the possibility that long-lived particles could be produced but remain undetected. The present analysis exploits information originating from the CMS calorimeters to reconstruct jets and measure their energies. The information from reconstructed tracks, in particular the transverse impact parameter, is used to discriminate the signal of a jet whose origin is displaced with respect to the primary vertex, from the background of ordinary multijet events. The analysis is performed on data from proton-proton collisions at LHCb [5,6]. In this Letter, we present a new, more general approach to searching for long-lived particles decaying to combinations of jets and leptons, which is inclusive in event topology and does not require the reconstruction of a displaced vertex.",

The NNPDF 2.3 [13] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used to model the parton momentum distribution inside the colliding protons.

As no excess above the predicted background is found, upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section for long-lived resonances decaying to two jets or to a lepton and b quark. The limits are calculated as a function of the mass and proper decay length of the long-lived particles. For resonances decaying to a b quark and a lepton, cross sections larger than 2.5 fb are excluded for proper decay lengths of 70-100 mm. The cross section limits are also translated into mass exclusion bounds, using a calculation of the top squark production cross section as a reference. Assuming equal lepton branching fractions, pair-produced long-lived R-parity violating top squarks lighter than 550-1130 GeV are excluded, depending on the squark proper decay length. This mass exclusion bound is currently the most stringent bound available for top squark proper decay lengths greater than 3 mm.",
