In the recent years, very large volume neutrino telescopes have started contributing to the field. First ANTARES and then IceCube have relied on large and sparsely instrumented volumes to observe atmospheric neutrinos for combinations of baselines and energies inaccessible to other experiments. Using this advantage, the latest result from IceCube starts approaching the precision of other established technologies and is paving the way for future detectors, such as ORCA and PINGU. These new projects seek to provide better measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and eventually determine the neutrino mass ordering. The results from running experiments and the potential from proposed projects are discussed in this review, emphasizing the experimental challenges involved in the measurements.",

The absolute differences of the square of the masses (mass splittings 2 Advances in High Energy Physics \u0394 2 = 2 \u2212 2 with , = 1, 2, 3), which play a role in oscillations, are known to a precision better than 5%. While the sign of the mass splitting between the states 1-2 ( 2 > 1 ) is known from matter effects in solar neutrino oscillations, the relative difference between 3 and 1 remains unknown. The relative values of the neutrino masses are commonly referred to as the neutrino mass ordering (NMO) (the determination of the mass ordering is sometimes confused with the determination of the neutrino \"mass hierarchy,\" which requires additional information on the absolute scale of the neutrino masses [5]), which has two possible options: the normal ordering (NO), with 1 < 2 < 3 , and the inverted ordering (IO), with 3 < 1 < 2 . The determination of the NMO is important as the parameter can discriminate between flavor symmetry models [6]. Also, the sensitivity of experiments attempting to determine the neutrino nature depends on the NMO [7,8]. Finally, knowing the NMO would help to measure the value of the phase, which in turn would be an important step forward towards solving the fundamental question of the prevalence of matter over antimatter in the Universe. Better measurements of all the parameters involved in neutrino oscillations are therefore necessary to understand if the current model is correct and how to incorporate it to the Standard Model.",

PINGU and ORCA aim to improve the precision of these measurements and reduce the energy threshold to a few GeV, where matter effects are strong, and use these effects to measure the NMO. This review begins by covering, in Section 2, the current knowledge on atmospheric neutrinos and how oscillations affect their flux. Section 3 describes the design and operation of VLVNTs.

            "text": "In the saturated regime atmospheric neutrino oscillations are independent of the mass ordering, dominated by ] \u2192 ] transitions and well described by (8). Near the resonance condition transitions involving electron (anti)neutrinos also play a role, and patterns become complex. Figure 3 shows the survival probabilities of ] and ] for neutrinos and normal mass ordering. The original electron neutrino flux is expected to fully disappear due to matter effects over ] = [5,8] GeV and cos = [\u22120.9, \u22120.5]. The suppression of these oscillations due to saturation can be observed at about 10 GeV. The survival probability of ] shows abrupt changes that are due to the effects of matter. Muon neutrinos oscillate even if the resonance conditions are not fulfilled, which makes the effects of the resonance less obvious than for electron neutrinos. Resonant matter effects appear in the ] survival probability as modifications on the otherwise smooth and periodic disappearance pattern, as shown in Figure 3. Saturation is reached above 15 GeV and the survival probability becomes smooth. Figure 4 shows the transition probabilities of ] and ] into different flavors for the arrival direction cos = \u22120.7 assuming a normal mass ordering. They correspond to a onedimensional projection of Figure 3 along the dashed line. The bands demonstrate how the uncertainties on the oscillation parameters impact the expected probabilities. For ] it is easy to observe the same disappearance as in Figure 3 Measurements of neutrino fluxes above the saturation energy of about 15 GeV are largely independent of 13 , the neutrino/antineutrino admixture of the sample, and the ordering of neutrino masses. They provide excellent data for determining sin 2 23 as well as |\u0394 2 31 |. The NMO can only be accessed with neutrinos below 15 GeV, where matter induced resonances occur either for neutrinos or for antineutrinos. The survival probability of muon (anti)neutrinos, the main component of atmospheric neutrinos, is modified by matter effects by about 20%. As will be discussed in Section 3, VLVNT cannot separate neutrinos from antineutrinos event-wise and instead rely on the ]/] flux ratio and the difference in cross sections to identify whether oscillation probabilities of neutrinos or antineutrinos are modified by matter effects.",

Transitions of these type are almost symmetric between the two flavors (see Figure 4), but since the flux of ] is several times that of ] at the energy and zenith angle of interest (see Figure 2), the net effect is a significant excess of electron neutrinos with respect to the original ] flux. In the NO, the ] flux is enhanced, while for an IO the enhancement is realized for ] . Because of the initial ] /] flux ratio and the differences in the ] /] cross sections, different orderings result in a different number of detected events.

The DeepCore fiducial volume used for data analysis is defined by a cylinder with a height of 350 m and a radius of approximately 150 m that starts below a dust layer, where the light transparency is reduced, as shown in Figure 7. This volume, which corresponds to roughly 2.5 times that of ANTARES, encloses about 550 DOMs with reduced spacing and results in a threshold for detection and reconstruction of neutrinos of about 15 GeV.",

At the ANTARES site (salt water) the absorption length, which is 60 m for blue light ( \u2243 470 nm) and 26 m for UV light ( \u2243 375 nm), reduces the number of photons observed. The effective scattering length, which is 256 m for blue light and 122 m for UV light, is considerably larger than the spacing between sensors [56]. In the clear ice in which DeepCore is located the absorption length of UV light ( \u2243 400 nm) is of the order of 200 m, which is larger than the spacing between sensors. The effective scattering length in the deep Antarctic ice is approximately 50 m, comparable to the string distance of DeepCore, thus significantly modifying the expected time of arrival of photons [57,58]. Water offers the advantage of being a homogeneous medium. Nonetheless, sea currents can deviate the detector lines so the position of the lines needs to be monitored constantly. This is achieved by combining acoustic triangulations with tilt and compass measurements yielding a precision better than 10 cm, which does not affect the angular resolution [59]. High sea currents can also trigger bioluminescence bursts that must be accounted for in the optical background simulation, in addition to the stable optical noise arising for 40 K decays. The latter can be used for determining the absolute detection efficiency of the optical modules.",

A disadvantage of using ice is that the medium is not homogeneous and its structure has to be modeled. This is particularly challenging in the immediate surroundings of the optical modules. Columns of the original glacier are melted to deploy the instrumentation. The refreezing process leaves behind clear ice near to the boundaries of the hole, and a cylinder of ice of about 10 cm in diameter with a high concentration of bubbles towards the center of the column. These changes in ice properties modify the DOM angular acceptance measured in the laboratory.

For the energy range under consideration, the most general hypothesis is an interaction which produces a hadronic shower (all interaction types), an electromagnetic shower (] CC), or a long range muon (] CC). The direction in which these particles are produced is reconstructed from the arrival times of the emitted photons. The Cherenkov light of muons is produced almost perfectly in a cone. The light coming from the cascade is also beamed in the Cherenkov angle, but the smearing due to multiple particle contributions to it is larger, which degrades the achievable precision of directional reconstructions. This smearing effect is stronger for hadronic showers.",

This corresponds to a hyperbola of which the orientation of the asymptotes depends on the zenith angle. An algorithm that searches for these patterns, without assuming any knowledge on the arrival angle of the emitter, was implemented. The algorithm is capable of rejecting noise hits and keeping events down to energies of 20 GeV ( = 100 m) with photons in a single line and 50 GeV ( = 250 m) in multiple lines. Misreconstructed muons that appear upgoing are removed by selecting only events which have a good fit quality. This cut also effectively reduces the contribution of NC interactions from all flavors and ] CC interactions.",

A schematic view of the IceCube and PINGU (Gen2) DOMs is shown in Figure 17. By maintaining the basic IceCube design, the PINGU DOM minimizes risk and cost. The ORCA optical module will follow the KM3NeT design [97] with each DOM housing 31 small (3 ) PMTs arranged in a 17 glass sphere together with the associated electronics, as can be seen from Figure 18.

PINGU plans to tag atmospheric muons following the strategy developed in DeepCore, that is, using the outer detector strings to identify particles that enter the fiducial volume, and restricting the analysis to starting and upgoing events (see [9] and Figure 14). The cosmic muon background is expected to be on the level of a few percent, similar to DeepCore. Event reconstruction and selection in PINGU do not rely on direct hits, the single largest impact on signal efficiency in the latest DeepCore results. Signal efficiency in PINGU, therefore, is expected to be minimally affected by background rejection and reconstruction methods and largely defined by the number of photons observed from an interaction. The ORCA detector does not rely on an outer detector to tag muons. Current analyses reduce the impact of these muons by selecting only upgoing events and rejecting the misreconstructed ones using variables such as their reconstruction quality and the position of their reconstructed interaction vertex. The topology of neutrino interactions, track-like or cascade-like, is identified using the distribution of hit time residuals, distances between reconstructed vertices at various reconstruction steps, the quality of the reconstructions, and topological variables, among others.

For ORCA individual resolutions for neutrinos and antineutrinos are shown, while a mixture of both is given for PINGU.

The analysis is conducted by comparing the two-dimensional histograms of pseudodata and simulation as a function of the reconstructed energy and zenith.

Recently a thorough study of the interplay between the oscillations parameters has been reported in [108], consistent with the recent results from ORCA and PINGU. The authors also introduced uncertainties in the estimated energy and zenith resolutions, as well as additional (conservative) uncorrelated uncertainties. Their results show that after 5 years of data taking, the loss in sensitivity ranges from 24% to 40% under pessimistic assumptions (such as fully uncorrelated errors in each analysis bin), thus leaving room for a measurement of the NMO by ORCA and PINGU on a reasonable time scale.",
