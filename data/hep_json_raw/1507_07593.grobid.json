            "text": "In the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark several left-right asymmetries are possible for the hadrons in the jet. When only one unpolarized hadron is selected, it exhibits an azimuthal modulation known as the Collins effect. When a pair of oppositely charged hadrons is observed, three asymmetries can be considered, a di-hadron asymmetry and two single hadron asymmetries. In lepton deep inelastic scattering on transversely polarized nucleons all these asymmetries are coupled with the transversity distribution. From the high statistics COMPASS data on oppositely charged hadron-pair production we have investigated for the first time the dependence of these three asymmetries on the difference of the azimuthal angles of the two hadrons. The similarity of transversity induced single and dihadron asymmetries is discussed. A new analysis of the data allows quantitative relationships to be established among them, providing for the first time strong experimental indication that the underlying fragmentation mechanisms are all driven by a common physical process.",

            "text": "The description of the partonic structure of the nucleon at leading twist in the collinear case requires the knowledge of three parton distribution functions (PDFs), the number, helicity and transversity functions. Very much like the helicity distribution, which gives the longitudinal polarization of a quark in a longitudinally polarized nucleon, the transversity distribution gives the transverse polarization of a quark in a transversely polarized nucleon. Its first moment, the tensor charge, is a fundamental property of the nucleon. While the number and the helicity PDFs can be obtained from cross-sectional measurements of unpolarized or doubly polarized lepton-nucleon deeply inelastic scattering (DIS), respectively, the transversity distribution is chiral-odd and as such can be measured only if folded with another chiral-odd quantity. As suggested more than 20 years ago [1,2], it can be accessed in semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) off transversely polarized nucleons from a left-right asymmetry of the hadrons produced in the struck quark fragmentation with respect to the plane defined by the quark momentum and spin directions. Recently, both the HERMES and the COMPASS experiments have provided unambiguous evidence that transversity is different from zero by measuring SIDIS off transversely polarized protons [3]. Two different processes have been addressed. In the first process, a target spin azimuthal asymmetry in single-hadron production is measured, referred to as Collins asymmetry [2]. It depends on the convolution of transversity and a hadron transverse-momentum dependent chiral-odd fragmentation function (FF), the Collins function, which describes the correlation between the hadron transverse momentum and the transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark. The second process is the production of two oppositely charged hadrons [1, [4][5][6]. In this case the so-called di-hadron target spin azimuthal asymmetry originates from the coupling of transversity to a di-hadron FF, also referred to as interference FF, in principle independent from the Collins function. In both cases, measurements of the corresponding azimuthal asymmetries of the hadrons produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation [7][8][9] provided independent information on the two types of FFs, allowing for first extractions of transversity from the SIDIS and e + e \u2212 data [10][11][12][13].",

These facts have been interpreted as experimental evidence of a close relationship between the Collins and the di-hadron asymmetries, hinting at a common physics origin of the two FFs [15][16][17][18], as suggested in the 3 P 0 recursive string fragmentation model [19,20] and, for large invariant mass of the hadron pair, in Ref. [21]. The interpretation is also supported by calculations with a specific Monte Carlo model [22].",
