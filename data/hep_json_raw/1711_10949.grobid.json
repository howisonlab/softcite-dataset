The search uses the data collected with the CMS detector from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Events are selected by requiring an isolated muon or electron, an imbalance in the transverse momentum, and at least six jets of which exactly two must be compatible with originating from the fragmentation of a bottom quark. No significant excess over the standard model predictions is found. A lower limit of 1.2 TeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of the spin-3/2 excited top quark in an extension of the Randall-Sundrum model, assuming a 100% branching fraction of its decay into a top quark and a gluon. These are the best limits to date in a search for excited top quarks and the first at 13 TeV.",

At the energy of LHC, the production cross section of spin-3/2 quarks is proportional to\u015d 3 , where \u015d is the square of the energy in the parton-parton collision rest frame, rather than \u015d \u22121 , as it is for spin-1/2 quarks [14]. Therefore, when integrating over the parton momentum fractions (x) in proton-E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. proton collisions, spin-3/2 quarks receive a contribution at large x values that is greater than that from spin-1/2 quarks. In the RS model, the spin-3/2 t * quark is expected to have a pair production cross section of the order of a few picobarns at \u221a s = 13 TeV, for a t * of mass m t * = 1 TeV [1,14,15], which dominates over single t * production for most of the parameter space in the model [12]. The t * quark decays predominantly to a top quark through the emission of a gluon [1,12,15,16].",
