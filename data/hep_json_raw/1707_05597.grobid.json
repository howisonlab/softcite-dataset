The W W \u03b3 production cross-section is determined using a final state containing an electron, a muon, a photon, and neutrinos (e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3 ). Upper limits on the production cross-section of the e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3 final state and the W W \u03b3 and W Z\u03b3 final states containing an electron or a muon, two jets, a photon, and a neutrino (e\u03bd j j\u03b3 or \u03bc\u03bd j j\u03b3 ) are also derived. The results are compared to the cross-sections predicted by the Standard Model at next-toleading order in the strong-coupling constant. In addition, upper limits on the production cross-sections are derived in a fiducial region optimised for a search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in the context of anomalous quartic gauge couplings using an effective field theory. Confidence intervals at 95% confidence level are derived for the 14 coupling coefficients to which W W \u03b3 and W Z\u03b3 production are sensitive.",

            "text": "Measuring triboson final states at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] provides a test of the non-Abelian structure of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics that predicts quartic gauge couplings. Deviations from the SM can be parametrised in the framework of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs). This paper describes a measurement of W V \u03b3 production by analysing events containing a W boson, a vector boson (V ), being either another W boson or a Z boson, and a photon, using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 recorded by the ATLAS detector [2]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch At LEP, W W \u03b3 production was studied at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 183 to 207 GeV in a variety of photon plus leptonic or hadronic final states [3]. The analysis presented here has a higher energy reach than the results obtained at LEP. The production of W V \u03b3 events was studied by the CMS Collaboration in Ref. [4] in final states containing electrons or muons and jets, and using a data set with a similar luminosity and the same centre-of-mass energy as employed here. Other analyses with three bosons in the final state and also sensitive to quartic gauge couplings have been performed by the ATLAS and the CMS collaborations [5][6][7][8]. Furthermore, exclusion limits on new physics beyond the SM described by aQGCs have also been set at the LHC using diboson final states including photons [9-11] and in diboson final states including massive gauge bosons only [12][13][14][15][16][17].",

The reconstruction of the detector information is outlined in Sect. 4. The analysis of the fully leptonic final state is described in Sect. 5 followed by the description of the semileptonic analysis in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7 the fiducial region of the cross-section measurement is defined and the determination of the production cross-section in the e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3 final state is described. The derivation of upper limits on the W V \u03b3 production cross-section is also presented.

Top quark pair production in association with a photon (tt\u03b3 ) was generated with the MadGraph 5.2.1.0 event generator using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and interfaced to PYTHIA 8.183 [38] for the simulation of the hadronisation and the underlying event using the AUET2B [39] tune. The cross-section was normalised using the computations of Ref. [40] which were performed at NLO in \u03b1 S . The simultaneous production of top and antitop quarks (tt) and the production of W bosons in association with top quarks (W t) were generated at NLO in \u03b1 S with the POWHEG-BOX [41][42][43] program using the CT10f4 PDF set and being interfaced to PYTHIA 6.426 with the Perugia 2011C [36] tune and using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set.

The AUET2 [47] tune and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set were employed. All simulations that used the PYTHIA event generator employed the TAUOLA [48] program to compute the \u03c4 lepton decays.

The transverse momentum of the reconstructed electron or muon is required to be larger than 25 GeV. Events containing additional reconstructed electrons or muons with p T > 7 GeV are discarded. Photons are required to have E T > 15 GeV. Jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and to be within the volume of the tracking detector, |\u03b7| < 2.5, to ensure that jets originating from heavy-flavour quarks can be identified.

When electrons are misidentified as photons (fake \u03b3 from e), Z \u2192 ee production in association with jets and tt events can mimic the signal.

The expected signals are computed with the VBFNLO program and corrected for acceptance and efficiency for the Z \u2192 ee and the tt processes in agreement with the corresponding measurements [72,73]. Mainly events from W + jets production contribute as background when a jet is misidentified as a photon (fake \u03b3 from jets).

The simultaneous fit consists of three components: a binned extended maximum-likelihood fit of the invariant dijet mass distribution to constrain the W \u03b3 + jets contribution, a binned extended maximum-likelihood fit of the E miss T distribution to constrain the fake backgrounds and a twodimensional sideband method to constrain the contribution from fake \u03b3 from jets. The free parameters of the simultaneous fit are the normalisation of the W \u03b3 + jets background, the normalisation of the processes containing fake from jets and the normalisation of the processes containing fake \u03b3 from jets. The normalisation of all other background components is fixed. The fit is performed separately in the electron and muon channels of the analysis. For all three estimation methods the signal region with 70 GeV < m j j < 100 GeV is excluded such that the overall signal contribution to the fiducial region used for the background estimation is negligible. Therefore, the signal contribution in all regions used in the fit is neglected and the result is independent of the signal modelling. The m j j distribution is fitted in the range 10-70 and 100-505 GeV; the E miss T distribution is fitted in the range 0-300 GeV. No minimum E miss T requirement is imposed in the fit of the E miss T distribution, in order to increase the sensitivity to fake from jets, as these events are expected to have low missing transverse momentum. Apart from neglecting the signal contribution, the two-dimensional sideband method is performed as for the fake photons from jets in the fully leptonic analysis.",

The shape templates for all backgrounds are derived from simulation apart from the ones associated with fake from jets and fake \u03b3 from jets. The latter shape templates are obtained from data events selected similarly to the fit regions with some requirements modified as follows to enhance the contribution from the respective fake object. To estimate the shape template for fake e from jets, the requirement on E miss T is removed and the requirements on the electron identification and isolation are modified. To this end, the requirements on the calorimeter-based isolation and the origin of the electron track are removed and the track-based isolation requirement is inverted. To estimate the shape template for fake \u03bc from jets, the requirement on E miss T is removed and the requirements on the muon isolation and the origin of the track are inverted. To estimate the shape template for fake \u03b3 from jets, the requirement on the photon isolation is removed and at least one of the photon identification criteria based on the energy deposits in the first layer of the LAr calorimeter must not be satisfied. The m j j shape templates are also employed to extrapolate the background estimation results of the different background components to the signal region. Data/Pred.  Figure 4 shows the results of the simultaneous fit, in the upper panel for the electron channel and in the lower panel for the muon channel. In Fig. 4a, c the resulting E miss T distributions are presented; the events are selected using the criteria for the signal region, but the requirement on E miss T is removed and the requirement on m j j is inverted. The lower panels of the figures show the ratio of the observed number of events to the expected number of events, which agrees with unity within uncertainties. In Fig. 4b, d the resulting m j j distributions are shown. All signal selection requirements apart from the m j j requirement are imposed. The distribution observed in data is underestimated by the background estimation in both channels at low m j j values but agrees within uncertainties. As a cross check, an alternative shape template for the W \u03b3 + jets background is obtained from simulated events generated with SHERPA. While the resulting background estimate shows better agreement with the data at low values of m j j , no significant impact on the background estimate in the signal region is found. The event yields of the W \u03b3 + jets, fake \u03b3 from jets and fake from jets events in the signal  Table 2. The uncertainties in these components in Table 2 correspond solely to the statistical uncertainty from data. The uncertainty in the total number of background events has several sources. The uncertainty associated with the shape templates is estimated by performing 10,000 pseudo experiments that use alternative shape templates obtained from sampling the nominal ones bin-wise using a Gaussian distribution. The width of the Gaussian distribution corresponds to the statistical uncertainty of the shape templates determined from data, or to the statistical uncertainty of the MC simulation and the uncertainties from the theoretical calculation if they are determined from simulation. The shape templates are varied simultaneously and yield an uncertainty in the total background of 5% (4%) in the electron (muon) channel. The experimental uncertainties are the uncertainties due to reconstruction and identification efficiencies of the objects [50,52,54,74,75] including energy scale and energy resolution uncertainties [52,55,60,67,68] as well as uncertainties arising from the simulation of the event pile-up [61]. These uncertainties are estimated for all background components simultaneously and amount to a total of 4 (3%) in the electron (muon) channel. They are dominated by the uncertainty in the jet energy scale. The uncertainty related to the choice of fit boundaries for the extended maximum-likelihood fits is estimated by varying these boundaries. The lower m j j (E miss T ) boundary is set to 25 (15 GeV) and the upper boundary is set to 490 or 520 GeV (285 or 315 GeV) independently. The uncertainty introduced by the choice of binning for the distributions used for the extended maximum-likelihood fits is estimated by varying the bin sizes by a factor of two. The uncertainty due to the possible correlation of the selection criteria defining the sideband regions of the 2D sideband method is estimated by changing the value of the correlation factor \u03c1 from one by its uncertainty \u03c1 MC e\u03bd j j\u03b3 = \u00b1 0.38 ( \u03c1 MC \u03bc\u03bd j j\u03b3 = \u00b1 0.23) as extracted from the MC simulation expectation. The uncertainty associated with any of these fit parameter variations is less than 1% in each channel of the analysis. The statistical uncertainty in the expected total number of background events corresponds to 2.6 (2.5%) in the electron (muon) channel. Figure 5 shows the transverse energy distributions of the photon with the highest E T in the signal region in the electron and the muon channels. The data are shown together with the estimated background contributions and the expected signal yield. The expected distribution for a reference point in the parameter space of aQGCs (see Sect. 8) is also indicated. The lower panels of the two figures show the ratios of the number of observed events to the sum of expected signal and background events.",

The computations are performed at parton level, while the measurement is performed at particle level. Therefore, the cross-section predictions are corrected to particle level by multiplying them by the partonto-particle-level correction factors (C p2p ). Each correction factor is defined as the number of signal events that satisfy the selection criteria for the fiducial region defined at particle level divided by the number of signal events that satisfy the selection criteria for the fiducial region defined at parton level. These factors are evaluated using the SHERPA signal simulation and amount to 1.10 \u00b1 0.01, 0.64 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 for the e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3 , e\u03bd j j\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03bd j j\u03b3 final states, respectively. The main difference between these corrections for the fully leptonic and the semileptonic final states arises from the fundamentally different requirements on the presence of jets and partons in the events. The difference between the electron and muon channels in the semileptonic analysis arises from different overlap removal algorithms employed for electrons and muons; while jet candidates are discarded when they are close to electrons, muon candidates are discarded when they are reconstructed close to a jet, to remove contributions from heavy-flavour quark decays. The uncertainties of the parton-to-particle-level correction factors include the statistical uncertainty of the SHERPA sample and a systematic component evaluated as the difference between the corrections estimated with the SHERPA and the MadGraph signal samples. The latter uncertainty accounts for differences in the parton shower modelling and the description of the underlying event between the two generators. The expected cross-section at particle level for the different final states and for the average of the electron and muon channels of the semileptonic analysis ( \u03bd j j\u03b3 ) are summarised in Table 4. The expected cross-sections for the fully leptonic and semileptonic final states are of similar size despite the larger hadronic branching fraction of the W and Z bosons, as the selection criteria for the fiducial regions in the semileptonic analysis are more restrictive. The uncertainty in the expected cross-section is about 5% for all final states. This value accounts for the uncertainty associated with C p2p , the numerical accuracy of the calculation, variations of the renormalisation and factorisa- Table 4 Observed and expected cross-section upper limits at 95% CL for the different final states using the CL s method.

No additional uncertainty related to the scale introduced by restricting the jet multiplicity in the fully leptonic analysis is taken into account. This uncertainty has been shown to be of the same order as the already included scale uncertainty by studying W -boson pair production [76]. Accordingly, no additional uncertainty is considered here as the experimental uncertainties are comparatively large and its inclusion would not change the results of this analysis.",
