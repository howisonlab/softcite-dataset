            "text": "This paper describes a study of techniques for identifying Higgs bosons at high transverse momenta decaying into bottom-quark pairs, H \u2192 bb, for proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV. These decays are reconstructed from calorimeter jets found with the anti-k t R = 1.0 jet algorithm. To tag Higgs bosons, a combination of requirements is used: b-tagging of R = 0.2 track-jets matched to the large-R calorimeter jet, and requirements on the jet mass and other jet substructure variables. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multijet and hadronic top-quark background rejections are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Several benchmark tagging selections are defined for different signal efficiency targets. The modelling of the relevant input distributions used to tag Higgs bosons is studied in 36 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2015 and 2016 using g \u2192 bb and Z (\u2192 bb)\u03b3 event selections in data. Both processes are found to be well modelled within the statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

            "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV greatly extends the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment [1] to heavy new particles. In several new physics scenarios [2][3][4], these heavy new particles may have decay chains including the Higgs boson [5,6]. The large masssplitting between these resonances and their decay products results in a high-momentum Higgs boson, causing its decay products to be collimated. The decay of the Higgs boson into a bb pair has the largest branching fraction within the Standard Model (SM), and thus is a major decay mode to use when searching for resonances involving high-momentum Higgs bosons (see e.g. Ref. [7]), as well as for measuring the SM Higgs boson properties. The signature of a boosted Higgs boson decaying into a bb pair is a collimated flow of particles, in this document called a 'Higgs-jet', having an energy e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch and angular distribution of the jet constituents consistent with a two-body decay and containing two b-hadrons. The techniques described in this paper to identify Higgs bosons decaying into bottom-quark pairs have been used successfully in several analyses [8-10] of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by ATLAS.",

Gluon splitting into b-quark pairs at small opening angles has been studied at \u221a s = 13 TeV by ATLAS [16].

The topological clusters of the large-R jets are brought to the hadronic energy scale using the local hadronic cell weighting scheme [44]. The large-R jets are groomed using trimming [12,45] to discard the softer components of jets that originate from initial-state radiation, pile-up interactions or the underlying event.

Such requirements greatly reduce the number of tracks from pile-up vertices whilst being highly efficient for tracks from the hard-scatter vertex. Once the track-jet's axis is determined, tracks selected with looser impact parameter requirements are matched to the jet in order to collect the tracks needed to effectively run the jet flavour tagging algorithms. The tracks are matched to the jet by using the angular separation R between the track and the trackjet's axis. The R requirement varies as a function of jet p T , being wide for lowp T jets and narrower for highp T jets as described in Ref. [51].

A photon candidate that can be matched to a reconstructed vertex or track consistent with a photon conversion is considered as a converted photon candidate [53]. The photon energy estimate is described in Ref. [54]. Requirements on the shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter and on the energy fraction measured in the hadronic calorimeter are used to identify photons; the 'Tight' identification working point is applied in the analysis [53]. In order to select prompt photons, the photons are required to fulfil the 'Tight' isolation criteria. The photons are required to have |\u03b7| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.37 and E T > 175 GeV. The latter requirement is applied to insure efficient triggering.",

The track-jet matching to large-R jets is performed by applying ghost association [12,55,56]: the large-R jet clustering process using the anti-k t algorithm with R = 1.0 is repeated with the addition of 'ghost' versions of the track-jets that have the same direction but infinitesimally small p T , so that they do not change the properties of the large-R calorimeter jets. A track-jet is associated with the large-R jets if its ghost version is contained in the jet after reclustering. The reclustering is applied to the untrimmed large-R jets. The reclustered jets are identical to the jets before the reclustering, with the addition of the matched track-jets retained as associated objects. This provides a robust matching procedure, and matching to jets with irregular boundaries can be achieved in a way that is less ambiguous than a simple geometric matching.",

A weighted combination of calorimeter-based and track-assisted jet masses, m comb [48], is used in the analysis. The m comb resolution is very similar to the m calo resolution at Higgs-jet p T below 700 GeV and improves with increasing p T . Muons from semileptonic b-hadron decays do not leave significant energy deposits in the calorimeter, so they are considered separately in the calculation of the m comb observable. The resulting neutrinos are not taken into account because they are not measured by the detector directly. The fourmomentum of the closest muon candidate within R = 0.2 of the b-tagged track-jet is added to the four-momentum of the large-R-jet after subtraction of the muon energy loss in the calorimeter. Only the calorimeter-based component of the m comb observable is corrected [58]. The resolution of the muon-corrected Higgs-jet mass, m corr , is improved by about 10% at transverse momenta below 500 GeV, while the improvement is not as pronounced at higher p T , as was shown in Ref.",

Figure 4 shows the reconstructed Higgs boson mass distribution for Higgs-jets with a p T in the range 350 to 500 GeV. The mass region below 50 GeV is affected by grooming and out-of-cone effects. In the case of asymmetric H \u2192 bb decays, where one of the b-hadrons carries a large fraction of the Higgs boson p T , the large-R jet's axis is close to the direction of the higherp T b-hadron. The decay products of the lowerp T b-hadron could be removed by grooming or not fully captured in the large-R jet. That leads to smaller Higgs-jet masses. The mass region above 150 GeV suffers from additional contributions from initial-state radiation. A large fraction of the ISR is suppressed by selecting the reconstructed Higgs-jet containing the highestp T Higgs boson candidate.

The background rejection is higher for multijets than for hadronically decay-ing top quarks. The rejection varies between 120 (170) at low p T and 1000 (1300) at high p T for the loose (tight) mass window and double-b-tagging benchmark. In comparison with the benchmarks without the mass window requirement, the rejection is improved by about one order of magnitude, but the shape as function of p T is fundamentally different. At low p T , not all decay products of the top quark are contained in the large-R jet. Thus the reconstructed jet mass has a long tail towards low jet masses with a substantial fraction of jets within the mass window of the tagger.

They are based on the jet constituents and exploit quantities such as transverse momentum and angular distance between the constituents. They give information about different jet attributes such as shape (e.g. sphericity, aplanarity) or number of axes (e.g. two-subjettiness \u03c4 2 ).

Since the flavour fractions are corrected in the MC simulation, differences between the data and predictions after the b-tagging can be attributed to a difference between data and MC simulation in the dependence of the b-tagging performance on the large-R jet topology, in particular on the topology with two closely spaced track-b-jets. Figure 15 shows the flavour-fit-corrected p T spectrum of the large-R jet as well the j trk \u03bc and j trk non-\u03bc before and after b-tagging. As seen in the ratio plots, there is good agreement within uncertainties between data and MC simulation. The shape differences between data and MC simulations especially for the j trk non-\u03bc transverse momentum can be partially explained by the difference observed between Pythia8 and Herwig++ MC simulations. The double-b-tagging rate is defined as the number of selected large-R jets with at least two track-jets, two of which are b-tagged, divided by the number of all selected large-R jets with at least two trackjets. Figure 16 shows the double-b-tagging rate as a function of the large-R jet p T . Data and MC simulation agree within the uncertainties. The performance of the double btagging applied to two track-jets seems not to depend on the large-R jet topology with two closely spaced track-b-jets, and the default b-tagging calibration described in Sect. 5 can be applied for this analysis.",

The multijet background rejection improves by a factor of about five by adding a loose (corresponding to 80% signal efficiency) mass window requirement on top of the double-btagging requirement. The tight (corresponding to 68% signal efficiency) mass window requirement leads to an additional 30-50% improvement in the multijet background rejection. The multijet background rejection has a weak dependence on the jet p T for both mass window requirements. The hadronic top-quark rejection depends strongly on the jet p T . The rejection varies between 60 and 230 for the loose mass window and double-b-tagging working points. The largest improvement in the top-quark rejection for the tight mass window is about 70% and corresponds to the high p T and double-b-tagging working point.",

Events with two b-tagged track-jets are used. The \u03b3 + jets background and the Z \u2192 bb signal are normalised to data by applying a scale factor of 1.51 and 0.98, respectively. The upward-or downward-pointing arrows indicate that the Data/Fit ratio is out of the histogram range for these bins The jet mass and other substructure variables are often correlated and the double-b-tagging requirement enforces a twoprong structure. In general, the background rejection is larger for the multijet background than for hadronically decaying top quarks but still below two for the individual variables and the loose mass window working point. The b-tagging discriminant is very powerful but the jet substructure variables offer an alternative to the b-tagging working points. Especially at high Higgs-jet p T the efficiency to reconstruct two track-jets and the double-b-tagging efficiency decrease quickly. A combination of several substructure variables using multivariate methods could potentially increase the gain in performance in this phase space.",
