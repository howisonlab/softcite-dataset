            "text": "Radiative decays of mesons are an important tool for the investigation of their internal structure as the electromagnetic transition operators are well known and probe the difference between the initial and final state mesons in terms of their electric charge or magnetic current distributions. The established a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 decay constitutes a magnetic quadrupole transition. The \u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 decay was not measured before. It represents an electric quadrupole transition, which is expected to probe the charge distribution of the orbitally excited meson out to large distances. Radiative transitions can be calculated using the meson wave function obtained in various quark models. In addition, the vector meson dominance model is used to relate \u03c1\u03c0 and \u03b3\u03c0 decays via the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b3 equivalence. Various calculations do exist for the radiative width of the a 2 (1320). Applying vector meson dominance, a width of 375 \u00b1 50 keV was calculated by ref. [1]. Using a relativistic quark model for the meson wave function, a value of 324 keV was extracted [2], and 235 keV was derived from a covariant oscillator quark model [3]. Newer calculations in this model framework yield 237 keV [4]. The covariant oscillator quark model was also used for a prediction of the radiative width of the \u03c0 2 (1670); for two different model versions values of 335 keV and 521 keV are given in ref. [4].",

It offers very good conditions to study reactions of high-energy beam particles impinging on fixed targets at low to intermediate momentum transfers. Its acceptance covers mostly the phase space for final state particles emerging in forward direction. The data presented in the following were recorded in 2004 using a 190 GeV negative hadron beam, which consists of 96.8% \u03c0 \u2212 , 2.4% K \u2212 , and 0.8%p at the COMPASS target. The experimental setup is sketched in fig. 1. The target is surrounded by a veto system designed to reject non-exclusive forward or largeangle reactions. High-precision silicon micro-strip detectors with a spatial resolution of 8 \u2212 11 \u00b5m make vertex reconstruction possible for smallest scattering angles. The two spectrometer stages, which are arranged around the magnets SM1 and SM2, are both equipped with a variety of detectors for tracking, calorimetry and particle identification. The target consisted of 3 mm of lead disks, which were deployed either as one continuous disk or as two disks with 2 mm and 1 mm thickness, respectively. The latter two target disks, which were separated by 10 cm along the beam, allowed additional systematic studies. The present analysis uses events recorded with the so-called multiplicity trigger that selects at least two charged outgoing particles at scattering angles smaller than 50 mrad. For this purpose, a scintillator disk of 5 mm thickness and a diameter of 5 cm was placed about 62 cm downstream of the target. The hits in this scintillator had to be in coincidence with the beam trigger and an energy deposit of several GeV in the hadronic calorimeter HCAL2.",

The finite resolution leads to a statistical mixing of events with different t and thus to a partial loss of the coherence between the different production amplitudes. This can be taken into account by setting the rank N r > 1 in eq. (6). However, in the present analysis, amplitudes with M = 0 are observed to be coherent with respect to one another, as are those with M = 1. Thus N r = 1 is actually chosen, while the reduced coherence between these two sets of amplitudes due to resolution is taken into account by the concept of partial coherence (see appendix A.2).",

In this case, the process is almost collinear so that the production plane cannot be defined reliably and the contributions from = +1 and = \u22121 are poorly distinguishable. Thus at the limit of the extremely small t observed for the photon peak, the full intensity of the physical = +1 amplitude is reconstructed with approximately equal amounts of = +1 and = \u22121 contributions for each amplitude with M = 1. This introduces an artificial factor \u221a 2 in the amplitudes, which, however, is not considered separately in the following. The total intensity observed is thus contained and conserved in the incoherent sum of these two contributions as stated in eq. (6). This effect has been reproduced in a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation, with data being generated with amplitudes containing only positive reflectivity. Passing these data through the standard simulation and reconstruction chain, the same amount of negative reflectivity contributions appeared as in the experimental data.   -200",

This flux is not monitored precisely, and the absolute trigger and detector efficiencies are only partly known, so that the absolute beam flux is not determined reliably for the present data.

The number of kaons observed is obtained after subtraction of the small background that is estimated by a linear fit to the mass spectrum near the peak and extrapolated beneath the kaon signal. The corresponding decay vertex distribution in fig. 12 (c) demonstrates that these vertices are reconstructed in free space along the beam direction. At the downstream (right) edge the distribution vanishes at the position of the charged-particle multiplicity counter acting as the trigger counter. At the upstream (left) edge the positions of the beam telescope detectors measuring an incoming beam track limit the fiducial decay volume. The contribution of the small background stemming from pion interactions in the lead target is obtained from the vertex distribution in the neighbouring mass region 0.52 GeV/c 2 < m 3\u03c0 < 0.57 GeV/c 2 as indicated in fig. 12 (a), scaled according to the expected intensity below the peak of the mass spectrum, and subtracted. The resulting distribution is quite flat, as expected, but shows a small drop in the region just upstream of the lead target. This can be explained by multiple scattering of the three pion tracks in lead, which leads to a local broadening of the decay vertex distribution. The choice of the range of positions of reconstructed decay vertices in [\u2212350, 270] cm (shaded area in fig. 12 (c)) assures uniform reconstruction efficiency.",

The systematic uncertainties related to the variation of the model used for the PWA fits were derived comparing the total intensities obtained from models using either different thresholds for the 1 ++ 1 amplitudes or an additional 2 ++ 0 \u2212 \u03c1[D]\u03c0 amplitude with respect to the nominal fit model. The parameterisation of the mass-dependent widths covers again several aspects. The systematic uncertainty related to the fits determining the resonance parameters via Breit-Wigner functions covers different parameterisations of the mass dependence of the widths, as well as the inclusion or omission of the factor m 0 /m and/or the t min dependent term. The differences between the parameterisation of the phase space by the traditional angular momentum barrier factors and the phase space respecting the non-zero width of the isobars were evaluated. In addition, for the a 2 (1320) we take into account also the difference between our approach and a simplistic description of the a 2 (1320) shape given by the decay into \u03c1\u03c0 only (i.e. neglecting the \u03b7\u03c0 decay), as implemented e.g. in ref.

The value for the a 2 (1320) is \u0393 0 (a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (358 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 42) keV, where |F u C (t , t min )| 2 from ref. [7] is used. If F 2 eff (t ) in eq. (2) is approximated as F 2 eff (t ) = j 2 1 (t ) for the lead target, i.e. the Coulomb correction is not applied, we obtain \u0393 0 (a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (312 \u00b1 6) keV. Most earlier measurements reported lower values compatible with this value as given in table 3. The authors of ref. [21] report to have taken into account the Coulomb corrections and they estimated that it had \"minor impact\" on their result (see table 3). Our calculation, however, shows that the effect is 24% for our experiment and 15% for the conditions of the SELEX experiment. The result for the \u03c0 2 (1670) is \u0393 0 (\u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (181\u00b111\u00b127) keV\u2022(0.56/BR f 2 \u03c0 ).

The value for the a 2 (1320) is \u0393 0 (a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (358 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 42) keV. Comparing our measurement with theoretical predictions, we find our result consistent with the calculation from the VMD model given in ref. [1], while predictions from quark models are substantially lower. For the first time we present a value for the radiative width of the \u03c0 2 (1670), \u0393 0 (\u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (181 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 27) keV \u2022 (0.56/BR f 2 \u03c0 ). This is the first observation of the radiative width of an E2 transition in meson spectroscopy, which may provide constraints for further model calculations. technical support during the installation and the running of this experiment. This work was made possible by the financial support of our funding agencies. We would like to thank Prof. Norbert Kaiser (TUM) for his helpful comments.",

(A.6) and (A.7), which were provided by ref.

Breit-Wigner functions and background distributions are summed to single complex-valued terms, denoted in the following by B j (m). Their parameters were obtained by fitting the square of these B j (m) to the respective intensity of each amplitude.

Their relative phase as obtained from the PWA is shown in fig. 7(c) as a function of the three-pion mass.The phase shows a constant behaviour around the nominal mass of the \u03c0 2 (1670). This phase locking indicates the presence of the same resonance \u03c0 2 (1670) in both spin projections M = 0 and M = 1, which are allowed for J P C = 2 \u2212+ amplitudes for natural parity exchange as explained before. Again, a separate PWA was performed in bins of momentum transfer t while using a broad three-pion mass interval covering the main part of the width of the \u03c0 2 (1670), i.e. 1.50 GeV/c 2 < m 3\u03c0 < 1.80 GeV/c 2 . For this PWA fit the decay amplitudes of the significant partial waves are multiplied by mass-dependent functions containing sums of the relevant Breit-Wigner functions and additional background as given in appendix A.5. The relative phase between the M = 0 and M = 1 components of the \u03c0 2 (1670) (fig. 7 (d, e, f)) demonstrates the transition from Primakoff to diffractive production of the \u03c0 2 (1670) with M = 1 in the depicted range of t . Again, we observe the relative phase being approximately 90 \u2022 in the region of interest t < 0.001 (GeV/c) 2 , which limits interference effects between diffractive and Primakoff production in this t range. This allows the separation of the two production processes by a fit with a sum of two non-interfering contributions. At this point we do not make any statement about resonances in J P C = 1 ++ or J P C = 1 \u2212+ amplitudes with M = 1. Such amplitudes are present in the fit (see table A.1) and collect non-negligible intensities, but their interpretation in terms of resonances is not obvious. The clarification of their nature is beyond the scope of the present paper. The total intensities of the amplitudes with J P C M = 2 ++ 1 in the \u03c1[D]\u03c0 and J P C M = 2 \u2212+ 1 in the f 2 [S]\u03c0 decay channel are depicted infig. 8. They are fitted by an incoherent sum of Primakoff and diffractive productions to obtain the relative strengths of both contributions to be evaluated in the indicated range t < 0.001 (GeV/c)2 . This procedure is justified by the expected relative phase of \u2248 90 \u2022 between the photon and pomeron amplitudes, which is caused by the photon being real, while the pomeron corresponds to imaginary potential due to the absorptive nature of the strong interaction. For pomeron exchange, no phase difference between M = 0 and M = 1 amplitudes is expected. For this fit the Primakoff production is parameterised by d\u03c3 prim /dt \u221d exp(\u2212b prim (m)t ) instead of the extremely sharp form given by eq. (1), as discussed in sect.2.2. The diffractive contribution, in turn, is parameterised by \u03c3 diff \u221d t exp(\u2212b diff (m)t ), as for M = 1 in eq. (10). The resulting slopes amount to b prim (m a 2 ) = (1292\u00b153) (GeV/c) \u22122 and b diff (m a 2 ) = (374\u00b125) (GeV/c) \u22122 for the a 2 (1320) (fig. 8(a)). The quoted fit uncertainties take into account the error estimates from the PWA as they are indicated on the data points infig. 8. These slope parameters are in fair agreement with the expectations from the simulation of Primakoff production, namely b prim,MC \u2248 980 (GeV/c) \u22122 and b diff,MC \u2248 370 (GeV/c) \u22122 . These expected values are obtained following the procedure explained in",

In case of a virtual \u03c1, where the \u03c1-exchange mediates the \u03c0\u03c0interaction, the self-energy reads like \u03a3 \u03c1 (2 \u2212 s + s 1,2 \u2212 t 2,1 ), with 2 \u2212 s + s 1,2 \u2212 t 2,1 < 0, and is purely real-valued. A.4 Set of decay amplitudes Table A.1 shows the set of decay amplitudes used for the PWA presented in this paper. The wave set includes established amplitudes with M = 0 + attributed to diffractive dissociation. The amplitudes related to Primakoff production are provided as isobaric M = 1 amplitudes or as the ChPT amplitude. All Primakoff amplitudes are introduced with both = \u00b11 which is necessary due to the limited resolution as explained in sect. 2.2. Also included in the fit are an amplitude describing the decay of beam kaons into \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and an incoherent background wave that is homogeneous in phase space. Many amplitudes are introduced with an upper or lower threshold which is chosen in order to constrain them to the region where they are expected to contribute. A.5 Parameterisation of the decay amplitudes for the PWA covering the mass region of the \u03c0 2 (1670) in bins of t For the PWA fit covering the mass region around the \u03c0 2 (1670), i.e. 1.50 GeV/c 2 < m 3\u03c0 < 1.80 GeV/c 2 , in small bins of t (see sect. 2.3), both mass dependences and phases have to be taken into account.
