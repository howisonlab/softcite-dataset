Presented are measurements of inclusive isolated photon and diphoton production, vector boson plus jet production for different jet multiplicities, and event shape variables. Also presented are measurement results of multijet production together with phenomenological analyses to constrain the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton and to determine the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 s . In all cases, the data are corrected for instrumental effects and are presented at the \"particle level,\" which includes all stable particles as defined in Ref. [1]. The results are used to test either particlelevel predictions by Monte Carlo events generators, or perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations in fixed order in \u03b1 s which are corrected for non-perturbative effects.",

The latter are usually accompanied by hadrons, and their contribution can be significantly reduced by requiring the photon to be isolated from other particles in the event. Isolated photon cross sections are therefore dominated by prompt photons. At lowest order, prompt photons are produced via quarkgluon Compton scattering or quark-antiquark annihilation, and are therefore directly sensitive to the dynamics of the hard subprocess and to \u03b1 s and the PDFs of the hadrons. Furthermore, diphoton final states are also signatures for various new physics processes, such as extra spatial dimensions and for heavy new particles, such as the Higgs boson, decaying into photons.",

However, it was observed [4] that not all experimental data are consistently described by pQCD calculations in fixed order of \u03b1 s . On the one hand, it was arXiv:1202.0205v1 [hep-ex] 1 Feb 2012 argued that the existing data may not be consistent [4]. It was also suggested that the phenomenological introduction of an intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons may help improve the description of the data and reduce the inconsistencies [5]. But this ad-hoc procedure still had a significant model dependence and was not seen to be a fundamental solution. In recent global PDF fits photon data have been excluded [6,7,8]. In order to rescue the photon data as a source of additional information on the PDFs, it is important either to identify critical missing pieces in theory or to clearly establish inconsistencies of existing data sets. Precision measurements in new kinematic regions are vital for testing theory predictions.",

The CDF results are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the photon transverse energy. The pQCD predictions are computed in next-to-leading order (NLO) in \u03b1 s using the program jetphox [11,12] with CTEQ6.1M PDFs [13], and renormalization and factorization scales set to \u00b5 R,F = E \u03b3 T . The E \u03b3 T dependence of the data/theory ratio is consistent with what was observed by D\u00d8, and by previous isolated photon measurements in collider and fixed target experiments at lower energies. To investigate the potential sources of disagreement in more detail, the D\u00d8 collaboration has subsequently measured this cross section more differentially [14]. For this purpose, also the jet (produced in association with the photon) was tagged, and the photon plus jet cross section was measured in four regions of the photon and jet rapidities: For central jets (|y jet | < 0.8) and for forward jets (1.5 < |y jet | < 2.5), and in each case for same side photons (y \u03b3 \u2022 y jet > 0) and for opposite side photons (y \u03b3 \u2022 y jet < 0). Again, in none of these rapidity regions could theory describe the E \u03b3 T dependence observed in data.",

Especially, Z boson plus b jet production is a significant background for associated Standard Model Higgs production (ZH \u2192 Zbb) and for searches of supersymmetric partners of the b quark.",

Jets are reconstructed using the Run II midpoint cone jet algorithm with cone radius R = 0.5. The W + n jet events are selected by requirements on the central electron (p T > 15 GeV), the missing transverse energy (E / T > 20 GeV), the transverse mass of the W boson candidate (M W T > 40 GeV), and the jet transverse momenta (p T > 20 GeV). In addition, the spatial distance (in \u03b7, \u03c6) between the electron and the nearest jet is required to be \u2206R > 0.5. Acceptance corrections and background contributions from Z + jets, tt, diboson, and single top production are estimated using different Monte Carlo event generators [29]. The backgrounds from multijet production are determined using a data driven method. After background subtraction, the differential distributions in jet p T are corrected for experimental effects, and the corrected differential cross sections are normalized to the measured inclusive W boson cross section. The results are displayed in Fig. 4 as a function of p T (separately for the first, second, third and fourth jet) and compared to pQCD predictions in NLO (for n \u2264 3) or LO (for n = 4) which have been corrected for non-perturbative effects. The theory predictions have been obtained using the generators black-hat+sherpa [30] (solid line) and rocket + mcfm [31,32]   (dashed line). In general, within their uncertainties, the NLO pQCD predictions reproduce the data, except in a few regions (the low p T region for W + 1 jet where theory is slightly higher, and the high p T region for W + 3 jets where theory is slightly lower than the data). The LO predictions for W + 4 jets describe the data well, but they are subject to huge uncertainties from the renormalization scale dependence.",

A comprehensive set of differential cross sections is measured, including distributions of the jet multiplicities, the jet rapidities, the jet transverse momenta, and the sum of all jet transverse momenta. Furthermore, the Z/\u03b3 * + 2 jet cross section has been measured differentially in a set of variables, related to the dijet system (M j j , \u2206R j j , \u2206\u03c6 j j , p j j T ). The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.2 fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed using the Run II midpoint algorithm with cone size R = 0.7, for p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.1. The leptons from the Z/\u03b3 * decay are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.0 and a spatial distance to the nearest jet of \u2206R > 0.7. The measurements for the electron and muon channels are performed independently and are combined taking into account asymmetric uncertainties. The data are corrected for detector effects and are compared to predictions from pQCD at NLO (for n = 1,2,3) or LO (n = 4) from blackhat+sherpa which are corrected for non-perturbative effects. While  the p T and rapidity distributions for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet and for Z/\u03b3 * + 2 jet are reasonably well described by theory, theory predicts a significantly lower cross section for Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jet production. The p T distribution for the third jet is shown in Fig. 5, compared to the theory results in LO and NLO. The large k factor (defined as the ratio of NLO and LO) suggests a poor convergence of the perturbative expansion, and that the failure of NLO could easily be due to missing higher order terms.",

            "text": "Event shape variables have been successfully used in e + e \u2212 collisions for studying properties of the strong interaction and for determinations of \u03b1 s . Recently, resummed theory predictions (NLO+NLL) for event shape variable in hadron-hadron collisions have become available [34]. The CDF collaboration has published measurements of the variables thrust and thrust minor in a data set corresponding to 0.385 fb \u22121 [35]. Jets are defined by an iterative cone jet algorithm (without midpoints). The event shape analysis is performed in an inclusive dijet event sample with both leading jets in the central region (\u03b7 < 0.7) and with E max T > 200 GeV. The event shape variables are defined in the transverse plane, over all final state momenta in the full detector acceptance of |\u03b7| < 3.5. Differential distributions of transverse thrust \u03c4 and transverse thrust minor T min are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The detector-level data (markers) are compared to pythia [20] (with tune A) on particle level (\"Tune A Hadron\") and with a detector simulation applied (\"Tune A + CDF Sim.\"). The small differ- ence between the two model predictions indicates that detector effects for these event shapes are small. It is seen that while pythia with tune A describes the rough features of the distributions, it does not describe the tails towards small and large values very well. A parton-level theory prediction in NLO+NLL (solid line), computed using nlojet++ [36,37] and caesar [38,39], is also overlaid on the data. This calculation does neither include hadronization nor underlying event effects. It was shown in the CDF publication [35] that hadronization corrections are actually small for these variables, but underlying event effects are large. Therefore one can not expect the NLO+NLL calculation to describe the data. The CDF collaboration has also proposed and measured a new observable, defined as the weighted difference of the mean values of thrust and thrust minor. From analyzing the contributions from hard and soft processes (the latter are assumed to stem from the underlying event) to the mean values of thrust and thrust minor, the authors have identified weighting factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 for the averages of both event shapes, such that their weighted difference (\u03b1 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b2 T min ) is less sensitive to the soft contributions from the underlying event. An additional correction factor \u03b3 MC for underlying event contributions was computed using pythia tune A and the variable \"thrust differential\", D, was then defined as D = \u03b3 MC (\u03b1 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b2 T min ). This variable D was measured as a function of E max T , the leading jet transverse energy in the event. The results, corrected to particle level, are displayed in Fig. 8 (markers) and compared to the particle level prediction from pythia tune A (dotted line) and to the perturbative (parton-level) prediction computed in NLO+NLL (solid line). Both predictions give a good description of the data within the theoretical uncertainties of 20%.",

This analysis has produced the best pre-LHC limits on quark compositeness, ADD Large Extra Dimensions, and TeV \u22121 Extra Dimension models. Furthermore, the dijet mass spectra show no evidence for resonances, produced by new heavy particles, decaying into jets. The CDF collaboration has therefore used the dijet mass spectrum to set stringent limits on hypothetical particles such as excited quarks, axigluons, flavor-universal colorons, E6 diquarks, color-octet technirhos, or W and Z bosons. Being confident that no new physics processes contribute to the measured jets, the inclusive jet data from both experiments have been used in global PDF analyses [6,7,8] exploiting the unique sensitivity of the jet data to the gluon density in the proton at high values of the proton momentum fraction x. Later, however, it has been seen that the rapidity dependence of the D\u00d8 dijet data is not well described by all PDFs which were obtained from PDF analyses including the inclusive jet data [45].",

Recent measurements extend these studies to different threejet observables.

The data are compared to theory predictions which combine NLO pQCD results (computed using fastnlo [50], based on nlojet++ [36,37]) and non-perturbative corrections (computed using pythia with tune DW [51]). The comparison is made for MSTW2008NLO PDFs [52] and the corresponding value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.120. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to the average p T of the three leading p T jets \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = \u00b5 0 = (p T 1 + p T 2 + p T 3 )/3. Ratios of data and theory are shown in Fig. 10 for different PDFs. For MSTW2008NLO PDFs, the ratios of data and theory are almost constant, with only a small dependence on M 3 j and the |y| and p T 3 requirements. The central data values are below the central theory predictions by approximately (4-15)% in the different scenarios, slightly increasing with |y| and with p T 3 . In all cases, the data lie inside the range covered by the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties (not shown here). Theory for CT10 PDFs [7] (and the corresponding value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.118) predicts a different shape for the M 3 j dependence of the cross section. For M 3 j < 0.6 TeV, the results for CT10 PDFs agree with those for MSTW2008NLO, while the CT10 predictions at M 3 j = 1.2 TeV are up to 30% higher. Further theory results are compared to the data for other PDFs, including NNPDFv2.1 [8]  The results for NNPDFv2.1 agree everywhere within \u00b14% with those from MSTW2008NLO. The cross sections predicted for HERAPDFv1.0 are (15-20)% below those for CT10 everywhere and their M 3 j distributions have a similar shape. The M 3 j dependence of the calculations for the ABKM09NLO PDFs is between the shapes of MSTW2008NLO/NNPDFv2.1 and CT10/HERAPDFv1.0. At low M 3 j , the predictions for ABKM09NLO agree with those for HERAPDFv1.0, while at higher M 3 j , they predict the smallest cross sections of all PDFs under study.",

            "text": "As discussed above, the interpretation of the three-jet cross section (and any other jet cross section) depends strongly on the choices of \u03b1 s (M Z ) and the PDFs. The impact of the latter can be strongly reduced, by studying observables defined as ratios of multijet cross sections. The D\u00d8 collaboration has presented a preliminary result [56] for the ratio of the inclusive three-jet and dijet cross sections, R 3/2 , measured as a function of the leading jet transverse momentum p max T . For this choice, in every p max T bin, the numerator is a subset of the denominator, and therefore the variable R 3/2 represents the conditional probability that a given inclusive dijet event also has a third jet. The value of p max T is a common scale for the three-jet and the dijet production processes. Therefore R 3/2 (p max T ) is directly sensitive to \u03b1 s at the scale \u00b5 R = p max T while the PDFs cancel to a large extent in the cross section ratio. In this analysis, the n-jet cross section (for n = 2, 3) is defined by all events with n or more jets with p T above p min T , in a given rapidity region (here: |y| < 2.4 for the n leading jets), for p min T = 50, 70, 90 GeV. The results are displayed in Fig. 12 as a function of p max T , for different p min T requirements (from left to right). Theory calculations based on NLO pQCD plus non-perturbative corrections are compared to the data for different PDFs (MSTW2008NLO, CT10, NNPDFv2.1, ABKM09NLO) using in all cases \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.118 (in the matrix elements and in the PDFs). In all cases good agreement is seen. ",

Figure 13 shows the cross section contributions as a function of momentum fractions x (here separately for x max and x min in an event) for the inclusive jet cross section bins of the D\u00d8 measurement. The (p T , y) bins in the top left above the solid line have only small contributions from momentum fractions x > 0.2 \u2212 0.3. Since all of these data points have p T below 145 GeV, the first issue does not become relevant here. This leaves 22 (out of 110) inclusive jet data points in the range 50 < p T < 145 GeV for the \u03b1 s analysis. The \u03b1 s extraction uses PDFs from the MSTW2008 analysis [6] which were obtained at NNLO (consistent with the precision of the theory calculation used here). These PDFs have been determined for 21 \u03b1 s (M Z ) values between 0.107 and 0.127 [52]. The continuous \u03b1 s (M Z ) dependence of the pQCD cross sections is obtained by interpolating the cross section results for the PDF sets for different \u03b1 s (M Z ) values. PDF uncertainties are computed using the twenty uncertainty eigenvectors (corresponding to 68% C.L.). The uncertainties in the pQCD calculation due to uncalculated higher-order contributions are estimated from the \u00b5 R,F dependence of the calculations by varying the renormalization and factorization scales in the range 0.5 \u2264 (\u00b5 R,F /p T ) \u2264 2. In a first step, data points with the same p T are combined to determine nine values of \u03b1 s (p T ) for 50 < p T < 145 GeV. These results are shown in Fig. 14  This is currently the most precise result from a hadron collider, with similar precision as recent results from jet production in DIS, and consistent with the current world average value [55].",
