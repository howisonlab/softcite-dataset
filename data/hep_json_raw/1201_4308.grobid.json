Events are searched for where a pair of top quarks is produced and one decays through the Standard Model t \u2192 Wb mode while the other decays through the FCNC mode t \u2192 qZ. Leptonic final states are used in which both the W-and Z-bosons decay leptonically, yielding final states with three leptons and two jets. The observed events are consistent with the expected backgrounds from Drell-Yan and diboson production and a limit on the FCNC branching ratio of top quarks to qZ is set.",

Transverse momentum of the leading lepton (top left), reconstructed mass of the two leptons with same flavor and opposite charge (top right); E miss T (bottom left) and number of jets (bottom right), are shown. The background uncertainties shown include the MC simulation statistical uncertainties and the DD uncertainties. The signal distributions are normalized to the observed BR limit, at 95% CL.",
