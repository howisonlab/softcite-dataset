The measurements are performed with p+Pb data recorded in 2013 with an integrated luminosity of 25 nb \u22121 and pp data recorded in 2015 with an integrated luminosity of 28 pb \u22121 . The p+Pb results are compared to pp spectra, presented as a ratio of transverse momentum distributions in the two systems scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, the nuclear modification factor R pPb . The study of R pPb allows a detailed comparison of the collision systems in different centrality intervals and in a wide range of transverse momentum. It is shown that the nuclear modification factor does not have any significant deviation from unity in the high transverse momentum region.",

In the case a p+Pb collision is a superposition of several pp collisions, R pPb should not differ from unity. Using high statistics of 2013 p+Pb data, the CMS collaboration measured the inclusive charged particle production [5] that showed an enhancement of approximately 30% for particles with p T 20 GeV with respect to a baseline, derived from the pp data taken at lower and at higher center-of-mass energies. No pp data at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV were available at that time. Preliminary results from AT-LAS [6], which also rely on a similar interpolation, showed an enhancement compatible with the CMS results. The ALICE experiment measured R pPb in a lower p T region [7]. Trends shown in ALICE results do not support, but also do not fully exclude the enhancement seen by CMS. In the recent CMS measurement [8] using real pp data at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV from 2015 data taking period, the enhancement is reduced compared to the original result [5].",

First, the measured charge particle spectra are corrected for secondary and fake tracks. Those are either tracks matching to secondary particles or they are spurious combinations of hits not associated with a single particle. This correction, as well as all other corrections, is estimated as a function of rapidity (y) and p T . Rapidity is calculated assuming all particles have mass of pion and there is a correction dealing with this bias. The correction for secondary and fake tracks is estimated to be around 1% at low p T and as much as 7% at high p T and high |y|. The second correction is performed for the p T resolution. Iterative Bayesian unfolding [15] is used to correct for possible p T mismeasurement. Stable results are achieved after 2 iterations. The unfolding introduces a change of about 5% at high p T , while the effect for low p T tracks is much smaller. The next correction is for the track reconstruction efficiency. It is estimated after excluding fake and secondary tracks from consideration. The efficiency is around 85% at mid-rapidity and low p T , increasing to 90% at high p T . Efficiencies at higher |y| are reduced by no more than 15%. Finally, a last correction is applied to account for the fact that the pion mass is used for all tracks to calculate the rapidity in all previous corrections as well as in measured distributions. This gives a bias for other particles (mostly kaons and protons). The correction is determined using MC simulations with the true mass of each particle. It is up to 1% at p T \u2248 5 GeV and decreases with increasing p T .",
