The measurement is performed for a dimuon invariant mass of 12 GeV < mt+t-< 70 GeV.

            "text": "When proton-proton (pp) beams collide at the LHC, typically rare photon-photon induced (yy ) interactions occur at perceptible rate and provide a unique opportunity to study high-energy electroweak processes [1]. Compared to other final states, the dilepton production is a standard candle process of the photon-induced production mechanism, thanks to its sizeable cross-section. Using pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of y/s = 7 TeV, measure ments of pp (yy) p+p-pp production (referred to as exclusive yy p+p-) were performed by the ATLAS and CMS collabo rations [2,3]. The exclusive yy e+e-process was also mea sured [3,4]. A similar experimental signature has been used to study the yy W+Wreaction [5][6][7]. The exclusive yy p+ p-production process competes with the two-photon interactions involving singleor double-proton dissociation due to the virtual photon exchange ( Fig. 1 (a-c)). The electromagnetic (EM) break-up of the proton typically re sults in a production of particles at small angles to the beam direction, which can mimic the exclusive process. However, the proton-dissociative processes have significantly different kine matic distributions compared to the exclusive reaction, allow ing an effective separation of the different production mecha nisms.",

They are mainly related to additional gluon interactions between the protons (or proton remnants), shown in Fig. 1 (d), which take place in addition to the QED process. The size of the absorption is not expected to be the same for exclusive and dissociative processes; it may also depend on the reaction kinematics. These effects lead to the suppression of exclusive cross-sections (typically around 10-20%) by producing extra hadronic activity in the event besides the final-state muons. Recent phenomenological studies suggest that the exclusive cross-sections are suppressed, with a survival factor that decreases with mass [11,12].",

Because some helic ity amplitudes vanish for the yy p+ p-process in the limit of massless leptons, this effect plays a less significant role in the sup pression of the pp(yy) p+p-pp cross-section. As in the model described above, the proton transverse profile function controls the reduction of the exclusive production cross-section when pp collisions become central.

[3,48], the shape of the charged-particle multiplicity distribution in simulated DY events is reweighted to match the spectrum observed in data. The uncorrected Z/y * model overestimates the charged-particle spec trum observed in data by 50% for low-multiplicity events. In order to estimate the relevant weights, the events in the Z-mass re gion (defined as 70 GeV < mp+p-< 105 GeV) are used, since this region is expected to include a large DY contribution. The distri bution of the number of tracks associated with the dimuon vertex after applying the charged-particle reweighting procedure to DY simulation is shown in Fig. 2 (a) for events in the Z-mass region. A small mismodelling of this distribution is due to the contribu tion from fake tracks and secondary particles [48], not taken into account in the correction procedure. Similarly to Ref. [50], the un derlying event activity in DY events is found to be independent of the dimuon invariant mass, down to mp+p-= 12 GeV. For this reason, the same weights are applied to simulated DY events out side the Z-mass region (Fig. 2 (b)), and the description of chargedparticle multiplicity is found to be satisfactory.

Background: The uncertainty in the contribution of the DY pro cess mainly accounts for disagreement between the data and simulation in charged-particle multiplicity modelling (10%). It also includes a 5% contribution due to the PDF and scale un certainties [51]. An overall normalisation uncertainty of 20% is assigned to cover these effects. Because of the similar shapes of the DY and S-diss yy p+ p-components in the fitted acoplanarity distribution, the uncertainty in the DY normali sation is partly absorbed by the S-diss contribution. The 20% uncertainty has typically a 0.7% effect on the extracted num ber of signal events.",

The D-diss background uncer tainty produces an uncertainty of 0.2% in the cross-sections, which is consistent with the full difference between the pre dictions obtained with the NNPDF2.3QED, CT14QED [27] and LUXqed17 [28] central values. The impact of these two background uncertainty sources is added in quadrature, yielding the uncertainty in N^ (Sbkg.), which is less than 0.8%. Template shape: The default signal acoplanarity template is con structed using bare EPA predictions from Herwig. When using the acoplanarity templates from SuperChic2 or from Ref. [11], the extracted number of signal events is lower by 2-3%, which is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The impact of the proton elastic form-factor modelling on the signal acoplanarity tem plate is evaluated in a similar way to Ref. [3] and takes into account differences between various parameterisations of pro ton EM form factors. This has a 0.4% effect on the extracted number of signal events. The impact of the non-zero crossing angles of the LHC beams at the ATLAS interaction point is estimated by applying a Lorentz transformation to the generator-level lepton kinematics for signal MC events. This results in a neg ligible variation of the cross-sections. The LHC beam energy uncertainty is estimated to be 0.1% [53]. It affects the cross sections by less than 0.1% and is considered to be a negligible effect. Unfolding method: The bin-by-bin correction used in the calcula tion of the cross-sections is compared to an iterative Bayesian unfolding technique [54]. The differences between these two approaches are found to be negligible.",

Other cross-checks: To check the impact of MC modelling of neu tral particles in the background processes, the analysis is re peated at generator level by requiring no extra neutral particle with pT > 400 MeV and |n| < 2.5, in addition to the chargedparticle exclusive selection. This extra requirement shows neg ligible impact on the analysis. In similar generator-level studies, the pT threshold for charged particles is lowered to 100 MeV. The MC event yields for the dominant S-diss and a smaller D-diss background processes remain unchanged. For DY background the yield is suppressed by 80%.

While the finite-size parameterisation of absorptive effects describes the data reasonably well, mismodelling at the level of 10-20% is observed with SuperChic2. Moreover, at large masses, SuperChic2 predicts less steeper decrease of the survival factor as a function of (x). For example, the survival factor for fully ex clusive yy W+ Wproduction at /s = 13 TeV is 0.82 [12] or 0.65 [11], respectively. A larger suppression of the EPA cross sections in the finite-size approach is obtained by requiring that only photons outside the proton (with rp = 0.64 fm) can initiate the exclusive photon-induced process.",
