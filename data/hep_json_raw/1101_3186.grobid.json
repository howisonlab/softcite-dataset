At the same time, HEP has no coherent strategy for data preservation and re-use, and many important and complex data sets are simply lost. In a period of a few years, several important and unique experimental programs will come to an end, including those at HERA, the b-factories and at the Tevatron. An inter-experimental study group on HEP data preservation and long-term analysis (DPHEP) was formed and a series of workshops were held to investigate this issue in a systematic way. The physics case for data preservation and the preservation models established by the group are presented, as well as a description of the transverse global projects and strategies already in place.",

In most cases the next generation collider operates at a higher energy frontier or intensity than the previous one. This feature is displayed in figure 1, which shows the last 50 years in particle physics, where the clear trend to higher energies is visible in both hadron-hadron and e + e \u2212 colliders [1].",

At the same time, a generation of other high energy physics (HEP) experiments are concluding their data taking and winding up their physics programmes. These include H1 and ZEUS at the world's only e \u00b1 p collider HERA (data taking ended July 2007), BaBar at the e + e \u2212 collider at SLAC (ended April 2008) and the Tevatron pp experiments D\u00d8 and CDF, who are now due to stop data taking in September 2011 [3]. The Belle experiment also recently concluded data taking at the KEK e + e \u2212 collider, where upgrades are now ongoing until 2012 [4].",

However, HEP has little or no tradition or clear current model of long term preservation of data in a meaningful and useful way. It is likely that the majority of older HEP experiments have in fact simply lost the data: misplaced, accidentally deleted, or if still existing only in some unusable state. The preservation of and supported long term access to the data is generally not part of the planning, software design or budget of a HEP experiment and for the few known preserved HEP data examples, in general the exercise has not been a planned initiative by the collaboration but a push by knowledgeable people, usually at a later date. The distribution of the data complicates the task, with potential headaches arising from ageing hardware where the data themselves are stored, as well as from unmaintained and outdated software, which tends to be under the control of the (defunct) experiments rather than the associated HEP computing centres.",

One of the main assumptions concerning experimental HEP data is that older data will always be superseded by that from the next generation experiment, usually at the next energy frontier. However, this is not always the case as illustrated by the two following recent, notable examples of analysis of older HEP data. The re-analysis of the JADE experimental e + e \u2212 data from the PETRA collider (DESY, 1979-1986), using a refined theoretical input, state of the art simulation and new anlaysis techniques has lead to a significant improvement in the determination of the strong coupling, in an energy range that is still unique [17,18]. The running of the strong coupling, in agreement with the QCD prediction demonstrates the concept of asymptotic freedom [19,20], as illustrated in figure 3 (left), where the results from a similar analysis by the ALEPH experiment [21] are also shown.",

This scenario is true of the LEP papers, where the publication timeline exhibits a long tail extending well beyond the end of data taking [29].

The general status of the LEP data, which was recorded as recently as the year 2000, is a concern, despite the continued paper output. A recent review of the status of the data of the four experiments identified that efforts are needed to ensure long term access [31]. The implementation of a data preservation model as early as possible in the lifetime of an experiment may greatly increase the likelihood of success, minimise the effort and ease the use of the data in the final years of the collaboration. In order to identify different models of data preservation, first an important question must be asked: What is HEP data? The data themselves, the digital information in the event files and in databases, are only a small part of the complete picture: data preservation is not just about the data! Indeed, discussions within the DPHEP study group suggest for pre-LHC experiments a total of between on half and a few PB of data should be preserved, such that today's computing centres are, at least by volume arguments, able to store the data 1 . In addition, the various software (simulation, reconstruction, analysis, user) must be considered. Concerning documentation, publications of data analysis or detector studies may be in journals, on SPIRES or arXiv, in HEPDATA or some other database, and may take the form of full papers, notes, manuals or slides. Many types of internal meta-data may also exist. The unique expertise of collaboration members is also at risk, as the person power associated to the experiment decreases. By planning a transition of the collaboration structure to something more suited to an archival 1 The collisions recorded by the LHC experiments result in 10's of TB of data per day, or up to 15 PB per year. mode, this particular loss may be minimised (see section 5). The different data preservation models established by DPHEP are summarised in table 1, organised in levels of increasing benefit, which comes with increasing complexity and cost. Each level is associated with use cases, and the preservation model adopted by an experiment should reflect the level of analysis expected to be available in the future. More details on each of the preservation levels is given in the first DPHEP publication [13].",

In the case of HEP, this means preserving the software and environment employed to analyse the data (level 3 preservation model), or if the reconstruction software is also included, a model where the data or Monte Carlo maybe reproduced (level 4 preservation model). While freezing the software in the current state is an option, experience has shown that this strategy would sustain analysis capability for only a limited amount of time, as well as introducing limitations by design. In order to preserve analysis capabilities for longer periods it would be beneficial to migrate to the  latest software versions and technologies for as long as possible. Given the pace of technological changes, concerning multi-core CPU design, changing storage models and system architechtures, as well the dependence on infrastructures such as the GRID or Clouds, and their associated protocols, this is a challenging prospect [32]. It would therefore be beneficial to have a framework to automatically test and validate the software and data of an experiment against changes and upgrades to the environment, as well as changes to the experimental software. As such a framework would examine many facets common to several current HEP experiments interested in a more complete data preservation model, the development of a generic validation suite is favourable. A test version of such a suite, which includes automated software build tools and data validation, is currently implemented at DESY-IT, in co-ooperation with the HERA experiments [33]. The scheme, which is illustrated in figure 5 is realised using a virtual environment capable of hosting an arbitrary number of virtual machine images, where the inputs to the images are separated into three catagories: experimental software, external software and operating system. An image is built with different configurations of operating systems and the relevant software, and pre-defined tests are then performed to detect migration problems and incoherence, as well as identifying the reasons behind them. Such a framework is by design expandable and able to host and validate the requirements from multiple experiments. A full version of the validation suite may now be implemented at DESY-IT, to safeguard the HERA data for the long term.",

As well as many overall improvements [35] with respect to the ageing SPIRES system, the INSPIRE project is preparing for the ingestion of much more high-level information in addition to the scientific papers themselves. These additions range from simple, documented information from the experiments about a given analysis, through wikis and news-forums, to even the data themselves, in a storage model where controlled access is possible. In a collaboration with the H1 experiment, INSPIRE will trial a few projects such as the hosting of H1 internal notes, and the linking of paper histories to publication records. This idea enables the presentation of the full history of a scientific result, from the initial conference presentations and papers, through internal talks and notes, to a final submitted and refereed publication. Another major advantage of such a scheme is that the responsibility of hosting the information passes from a defunct experiment to an active environment. An example of a new INSPIRE publication record [36] is shown in figure 6, where additional information would appear as an extra tab, which may, if desired, be only visible to collaboration members. There are clearly many possibilities for the experiments and INSPIRE to work together, and more fruitful collaborations are expected via the DPHEP study group.",

Such a scheme has started within the BaBar Collaboration [40] and following recent discussions within DPHEP about common data formats, a true, global HEP data portal for outreach purposes seems possible. The Belle Collaboration also have an outreach programme, B-Lab, aimed at high school students, which uses real experimental data [41].",

An early preparation is needed and sufficient resources should be provided in order to maintain the capability to re-investigate such older data samples. However, the additional resources are estimated to be rather small in comparison to the person power allocated during the running period of an experiment. Typically, a surge of 2-3 FTEs for 2-3 years, followed by steady 0.5-1.0 FTE per year per experiment is required for the implementation of a level 3 or 4 preservation model, which should be compared to 300-500 FTEs per experiment for many years. Therefore, the data preservation cost estimates represent typically much less than 1% of the original investment, for a potential 5-10% increase in physics output.",

However, until recently no coherent strategy existed regarding long term access of HEP data and an international study group, DPHEP, was formed to address this issue in a systematic way. Given the current experimental situation, data preservation efforts in HEP are timely, and large laboratories should define and install data preservation projects in order to avoid catastrophic loss of data once major collaborations come to an end. The preservation of the full analysis capability of experiments, including the reconstruction and simulation software, is recommended in order to achieve a flexible and meaningful preservation model. Such a project requires a strategy and well-identified resources, but provides additional research at particularly low cost, enhancing the return on the initial investment in the experimental facilities. The efforts of the group are best performed within the common organisation at the international level DPHEP, through which there is a unique opportunity to build a coherent structure for the future. Common requirements on data preservation are now evolving via DPHEP into inter-experimental R&D projects, optimising the development effort and potentially improving the degree of standardisation in HEP computing in the longer term. The next DPHEP workshop is at Fermilab in May 2011 and a second publication is expected shortly from the group, describing the current projects in more detail and providing recommendations and guidelines for future HEP experiments.",
