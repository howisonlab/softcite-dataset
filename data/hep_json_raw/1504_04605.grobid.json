A data sample with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is used. Standard Model processes rarely produce these final states, but there are several models of physics beyond the Standard Model that predict an enhanced rate of production of such events; the ones considered here are production of vector-like quarks, enhanced fourtop-quark production, pair production of chiral b -quarks, and production of two positively charged top quarks. Eleven signal regions are defined; subsets of these regions are combined when searching for each class of models. In the three signal regions primarily sensitive to positively charged top quark pair production, the data yield is consistent with the background expectation. There are more data events than expected from background in the set of eight signal regions defined for searching for vector-like quarks and chiral b -quarks, but the significance of the discrepancy is less than two standard deviations. The discrepancy reaches 2.5 standard deviations in the set of five signal regions defined for searching for four-top-quark production. The results are used to set 95% CL limits on various models.",

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) has been repeatedly confirmed experimentally. Nonetheless there is a need for physics beyond the SM (BSM) at about the TeV scale, with additional features that explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe, specify the nature of dark matter, and provide a mechanism to naturally stabilize the Higgs boson mass at its observed value of approximately 125 GeV [1,2]. This paper reports on a search for BSM physics resulting in pairs of isolated high-transverse-momentum (high-p T ) leptons 1 with the same electric charge, hereafter denoted as same-sign leptons, (or three or more leptons of any charge) missing transverse momentum, and b-jets. This is a promising search channel since the SM yields of such events are small, and several types of BSM physics may contribute. Among the models that predict enhanced same-sign lepton production are those that postulate the existence of vector-like quarks, an enhancement of the four-top-quark production cross section, the existence of a fourth generation of chiral quarks, or production of two positively charged top quarks. A common data sample is used to search for each of  Table 1. B and T quark branching fractions (in percent), assuming the singlet and (T, B) doublet models of ref. [25]. In the doublet case it is assumed that the mixing of the T quark with the Standard Model bottom quark is much smaller than the mixing of the B quark with the top quark.",

            "text": "these signatures, but separate final selection criteria are defined based on the characteristics of each signal model. Several extensions to the SM that regulate the Higgs boson mass in a natural way require the existence of vector-like quarks (VLQ) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], where 'vector-like' means that the left-and right-handed components transform identically under the SU(2) L weak isospin gauge symmetry. Since quarks with this structure do not require a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field to attain mass, their existence would not enhance the Higgs boson production cross section, and thus the motivation persists for a direct search [22]. There are several possible varieties of VLQ; those having the same electric charge as the SM b-and t-quarks are called B and T . In addition the exotic charge states T 5/3 and B \u22124/3 may occur, where the subscripts indicate the electric charge. Vector-like quarks may exist as isospin singlets, doublets, or triplets. Arguments based on naturalness suggest that VLQ may not interact strongly with light SM quarks [23,24]. Thus it is assumed for this analysis that VLQ decay predominantly to third-generation SM quarks. For the B and T quarks, chargedand neutral-current decays may both occur (B \u2192 W t, Zb, or Hb; T \u2192 W b, Zt, or Ht), providing many paths for same-sign lepton production for events with BB or TT pairs.",

The first is sgluon pair production, where sgluons are colouradjoint scalars that appear in several extensions to the SM [34][35][36][37][38][39]. If the sgluon mass is above the top quark pair-production threshold, the dominant decay is to tt, resulting in four top quarks in the final state 2 (tttt). The cross sections considered in this paper are rescaled to the next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction of ref. [41]. The second model is one with two universal extra dimensions under the real projective plane geometry (2UED/RPP) [42]. The compactification of the extra dimensions leads to discretization of the momenta along their directions. The model is parameterized by the radii R 4 and R 5 of the extra dimensions or, equivalently, by m KK = 1/R 4 and \u03be = R 4 /R 5 . This model predicts the pair production of tier 3 (1, 1) Kaluza-Klein excitations of the photon (A",

Under the assumption that the b -quark decays predominantly to W t, b pair production results in four W bosons in the final state. If two W bosons with the same electric charge decay leptonically, there will be a same-sign lepton pair in the final state. If the b -quark can also decay to W q, where q is a light (u or c) quark, some b pairs would also result in same-sign lepton pairs or trileptons (provided that at least one b -quark decays to W t), and therefore the possibility of such decays is explored as well. The existence of additional chiral quark generations greatly enhances the Higgs boson production cross section, so if the new boson observed at the LHC is a manifestation of a minimal Higgs sector, additional quark generations are ruled out [48][49][50][51][52][53]. However, a more complex Higgs sector, as in some Two-Higgs-Doublet models [54], allows a fourth generation of chiral quarks.",

A more recent search by the ATLAS collaboration [62] using an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with similar final states to those reported here was interpreted in the context of supersymmetric models.

The inner detector provides tracking information from pixel and silicon microstrip detectors within pseudorapidity 5 |\u03b7| < 2.5, and from a transition radiation tracker that covers |\u03b7| < 2.0. The EM sampling calorimeter uses lead as absorber and liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into a barrel region that covers |\u03b7| < 1.475 and endcap regions that cover 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The hadronic calorimeter consists of either LAr or scintillator tile as the active medium, and either steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber, and covers |\u03b7| < 4.9. The muon spectrometer covers |\u03b7| < 2.7, and uses multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers to measure the deflection of muons as they traverse a toroidal field of approximately 0.5 (1.0) T in the central (endcap) regions of the detector.

The remaining background sources are determined from the data, as described in section 4. B and T pair production is modelled using the protos v2.2 [25] generator using the MSTW2008LO [64] parton distribution functions (PDFs), with pythia v6.4 [65] used to model extra gluon emission and hadronization. T 5/3 production (both single and pair) is modelled with madgraph v5.1 [66] using the CTEQ6L1 [67] PDFs, with pythia v8.1 [68] used for hadronization. Production of four top quarks is modelled under four scenarios: i) Standard Model, ii) contact interaction, iii) sgluon pair, and iv) 2UED/RPP. The sgluon case is generated with pythia v6.4 using the CTEQ6L1 PDFs; the other three models are generated with madgraph using the MSTW2008LO PDFs followed by pythia v8.1; in the case of 2UED/RPP the bridge generator [69] is used to decay the pair-produced excitations from madgraph to tt. The JHEP10(2015)150 simulated 2UED/RPP samples correspond to the tier (1,1) for the symmetric (R 4 = R 5 ) case, with m KK ranging from 600 to 1200 GeV. Constraints on the asymmetric (R 4 > R 5 ) case are derived by an extrapolation that uses kinematical considerations [70]. These considerations also permit the extrapolation to signals arising from tiers (2,0) and (0,2) from the generated tier (1,1) signal. Pair production of b events is modelled with the pythia v8.1 generator for b masses ranging from 400 to 1000 GeV, using the MSTW2008LO PDFs. Production of two positively charged top quarks via a contact interaction is also modelled using protos [71] and pythia v6.4, with three different chirality configurations of the contact interaction operator; production via the FCNC exchange of a Higgs-like particle is modelled with madgraph with pythia v8.1 used for showering and hadronization.

Using measured values of r and f , one can construct a matrix that relates the observed yields of dilepton events in the categories loose-loose, loose-tight, and tight-tight to the real-real, real-fake, and fake-fake yields. An analogous procedure is applied to three lepton events starting with categories for all possible combinations of three loose or tight leptons, resulting in an estimate of the number of events with one or more misidentified leptons in the selected sample (N tt fake ). Single-lepton events are used to measure r and f . The criteria used to select these events are different for electrons and muons due to the differences in the sources of fake/nonprompt leptons for each flavour. For electrons, r is measured using events with E miss T > 150 GeV, where the dominant contribution is from W \u2192 e\u03bd, and f is measured using events with the transverse mass of the E miss T and electron 6 m T (W ) < 20 GeV and E miss T + m T (W ) < 60 GeV, where the dominant contribution is from multijet production where one or more jets is misidentified as an electron. For muons, r is measured using events with m T (W ) > 100 GeV, a sample dominated by W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd, and f is measured using events where the impact parameter of the muon with respect to the primary vertex is more than five standard deviations from zero, consistent with muons arising from heavy-flavour hadron decays. The small contribution of real leptons to the control samples used to measure f is estimated from simulation, and this contribution is subtracted from the sample. The values of r and f are parameterized with respect to properties of the leptons (e.g. |\u03b7| and p T ) and of the event (e.g. the number of b-tagged jets). Typical values are r = 0.90 and f = 0.20-0.40 for electrons, and r = 0.95-1.00 and f = 0.12-0.30 for muons.",

Therefore, r and f are measured separately for samples collected with the different triggers, and the appropriate values are applied based on the lepton triggers that fired in each event. A further complication may arise due to the small number of events in the loose sample, which can lead to a calculated value of N tt fake that is negative or very close to zero. In the case of negative values N tt fake is set to zero when computing limits. To properly estimate the statistical uncertainty on the fake/non-prompt lepton contribution given the small number of events, a Poisson likelihood for the estimate from the matrix method is used, and the standard deviation of the probability density function (p.d.f.) from this likelihood is used to set the uncertainty.",

One limitation of this estimate is that electrons from Z decay only rarely have large p T , rendering the uncertainty on the charge misidentification rate for high-p T electrons large. To reduce this uncertainty, the rate of charge misidentification is estimated using simulated tt events as a function of the electron p T . This rate is scaled to match the rate observed in data for the p T range covered by the Z events, and the rate for electrons with larger p T is extrapolated according to the scaled prediction from simulation.

One source of charge mismeasurement is from 'trident' electrons, where the electron emits a hard photon that subsequently produces an electron-positron pair, resulting in three tracks with small spatial separation. If the wrong track is matched to the EM cluster, the charge may be incorrect. However, such electrons would also appear to be isolated far less frequently than electrons that do not emit hard radiation. Therefore the value of r for trident electrons is lower than for electrons that have a correctly measured charge, meaning that they also contribute to the fake/non-prompt electron estimate from the matrix method.

These uncertainties have similar impact on the expected yields for the other signal models. For the yields derived from simulation, the largest source of uncertainty is the cross-section calculation. For the ttW/Z background, this is based on variations in the PDFs, variations of the renormalization and factorization mass scales (varied up and down by a factor of four from the nominal value of 172.5 GeV) [85], and variations in the parameters controlling the initial-state radiation model, resulting in a 43% uncertainty.

The magnitudes of these effects depend on the event characteristics, so the uncertainty on the background from electron charge misidentification varies from 23 to 40% in the signal and control regions, as presented in tables 2 and 7-9. The expected yield of fake/non-prompt leptons is subject to uncertainties in the real and fake/non-prompt lepton efficiencies that arise from i) variations in the values of r and f when different control regions are used to measure them, ii) the small number of events in those control regions, and iii) the MC model used to subtract the real lepton contribution from the fake/non-prompt lepton control region. When assessing effect i, the following alternative control regions are used: for electrons, the alternative fake/non-prompt control region requires one loose electron and E miss T < 20 GeV, while for muons, the alternative -  Table 7.

For the simulation-based background estimates: variations in the cross section, in the generators, and their settings that span the range consistent with theoretical expectations or direct measurements were applied. Variations in the expected yield are part of the systematic uncertainty. The data-driven estimates (for the charge misidentification and fake/non-prompt lepton backgrounds) were checked in several ways. The particular leptons observed in SRVLQ6 and SRVLQ7 were scrutinized, and their quality was found to be consistent with a sample dominated by real leptons. Similarly, the multivariate discriminant for b-tagging is well above the required threshold for tagged jets found in the sample. In addition, the expected contribution from charge misidentification and from fake/non-prompt leptons was assessed using samples of simulated events. It is found that the yields are consistent within uncertainties with the expectations from the data-driven estimates. To further investigate whether the matrix method accurately predicts the number of fake/non-prompt leptons in tt events, the entire procedure was repeated with samples of simulated events, with r and f measured using simulated single-lepton and multijet samples respectively. The predicted number of fake/non-prompt leptons in simulated tt samples is consistent with the actual number present in the MC samples. \u00b5 \u2212 e + e + 9 968 355 Table 11.

One unexpected feature is the dominance of one electric charge over another: in SR4t3/SRVLQ6 there are 10 negatively charged and 16 positively charged leptons, and in SR4t4/SRVLQ7 there are only 2 negatively charged leptons and 11 positively charged leptons. Similar effects are observed in two other signal regions, with SRVLQ3 being dominated by negatively charged leptons and SR4t2/SRVLQ5 being dominated by positively charged leptons. These charge asymmetries are interpreted as statistical fluctuations. This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that i) there is no known mechanism for the selection to favour one electric charge over the other; ii) the asymmetry is present only in some of the signal regions (and both negative and positive charges dominate in the various regions); and iii) that the asymmetries do not persist in the loose lepton samples selected with the same kinematic criteria as are applied in the signal regions.",

Several BSM physics effects could enhance the yield of such events over the small SM expectation. The search was performed in the context of several BSM physics models, with signal regions defined for different models. The regions of parameter space excluded by the data are quantified by setting 95% CL limits. The observed yield in the signal region for positively charged top quark pair production is consistent with the expected background, resulting in limits of 8.4-62 fb on the cross section of this process (depending on the model considered) and a limit BR(t \u2192 uH) < 1%. In the set of signal regions defined for vector-like quark, four-top-quark, and chiral b -quark searches there is an excess of observed events over the SM prediction, particularly in the subset of those signal regions that require at least two b-tagged jets (and thus are relevant to the search for four-topquark production). The significance of the excess varies with the signal being considered, reaching 2.5 standard deviations for hypotheses involving heavy resonances decaying to four top quarks. Nonetheless the data can still constrain some of the BSM physics models considered; 95% CL limits are set as follows: the mass of the chiral b -quark is constrained as a function of the branching ratio to W t, the masses of vector-like B and T quarks are constrained to m B > 0.62 TeV, m T > 0.59 TeV (assuming branching fractions to the W , Z, and H decay modes arising from a singlet model), the mass of the T 5/3 quark is greater than 0.75 TeV, the SM four-top production cross section is less than 70 fb, the sgluon mass is greater than 0.83 TeV and the Kaluza-Klein mass (in the context of models with two universal extra dimensions) is greater than 0.96 TeV.",
