A signature would correspond to a kink in the spectrum with characteristic shape and end point shifted by the value of a heavy neutrino mass.

Our equipment consists of two main components which are the Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source (WGTS) and the Electrostatic Spectrometer with Magnetic Adiabatic Collimation (MAC-E filter). Gaseous source allows to avoid solid state effects which distort spectra if tritium is frozen or implanted. The radioactive gas freely circulates in a source and there are no effects associated with a \"wall\" or \"window\". Electrons originating in the tritium decay are transported adiabatically by the system of superconducting solenoids to the spectrometer entrance with acceptance of 2.1% which is defined by magnetic filed values in the WGTS and the spectrometer magnet. Within our energy range acceptance variation is negligible. MAC-E filter works as the electrostatic rejector of all electrons with energy less than a given spectrometer potential, regardless of initial direction of electron momentum within acceptance. All electrons with higher energy are counted by the detector. Measurements with different values of retarding potential give integral energy spectrum of electrons.",

Such a long integration time is required in order to minimize the back scattering effect of electrons from the detector, which reaches 10-15% probability. Then these scattered electrons are reflected with some delay by the electrostatic and magnetic mirrors back to the detector. Relevant details of this feature of the MAC-E filter are described in Ref.

Simulation of the back scattering processes from the detector with reflection of the scattered particles back to the detector by electrostatic and magnetic mirrors [5], which dominate in this region of amplitudes, qualitatively shows similar exponential shape. The measured slope of this exponent is almost the same for different spectrometer potential or the electron energy. We extrapolate the ADC spectra using exponential fits in the narrow region 400 -600 ADC channels, and estimate the number of events under the threshold as an integral of this exponential function. The correction could not be calculated in this way for higher retarding potentials (above 17.5 kV), where the number of events is insufficient to do a reliable fit. Therefore, correction itself was extrapolated into this region using its shape at lower potentials, which is also exponential. The final correction for the threshold effect is 2-4 %. We assume that the systematic error here comes from the uncertainty of the fitting procedure. 4.2. Dead time. Currently the maximum count rate at the detector is 14-16 kHz and is limited by the \u223c 6.5 \u00b5s electronics dead time. If two events are close enough, namely in the range of about 2.5 \u00b5s, we get \"pileup event\" which is indistinguishable from a single event, but creates larger registered amplitude of the signal.
