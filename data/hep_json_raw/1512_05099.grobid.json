In the current study, the results of these searches are combined to provide a more stringent test of models predicting heavy resonances with couplings to vector bosons. Direct searches for a charged diboson resonance decaying to W Z in the \u03bd ( = \u03bc, e), qq, \u03bdqq and fully hadronic final states are combined and upper limits on the rate of production times branching ratio to the W Z bosons are compared with predictions of an extended gauge model with a heavy W boson. In addition, direct searches for a neutral diboson resonance decaying to W W and Z Z in the qq, \u03bdqq, and fully hadronic final states are combined and upper limits on the rate of production times branching ratio to the W W and Z Z bosons are compared with predictions for a heavy, spin-2 graviton in an extended Randall-Sundrum model where the Standard Model fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk of the extra dimension.",

For c \u223c 1 the effect of this coupling on the production cross section of the W boson at the LHC is very small, thus the production cross section of the W boson in the SSM and the EGM is very similar. Moreover, due to the small branching ratio of the W \u2192 W Z in the EGM with the scale factor c \u223c 1, the branching ratios of the W boson to fermions are approximately the same as in the SSM. Nevertheless, models with narrow vector resonances with suppressed fermionic couplings remain viable extensions to the SM, and thus the EGM provides a useful and simple benchmark in searches for narrow vector resonances decaying to W Z.",

After the jet formation a set of criteria is applied to identify the jet as originating from a hadronically decaying boson (boson tagging). A grooming algorithm is applied to the jets to reduce the effect of pile-up and underlying event activity and to identify a pair of subjets associated with the quarks emerging from the vector boson decay. The grooming algorithm, a variant of the mass-drop filtering technique [69], is described in detail in Ref. [23].

First, in all of the channels using large-R jets, a requirement on the subjet momentumbalance found at the stopping point of the grooming algorithm, \u221a y > 0.45, 3 is applied to the jet. Second, jets are required to have the groomed jet mass within a selection window. Due to the different backgrounds affecting each of the search channels, different mass windows are used for each channel. The high-p T jets in background events are expected to have a larger charged-particle track multiplicity than the jets emerging from boson decays. This is due to the higher energy scale involved in the fragmentation process of background jets and also due to the larger colour charge of gluons in comparison to quarks. Hence, to improve the sensitivity of the search in the fully hadronic channel, a requirement on the charged-particle track multiplicity matched to the large-R jet prior to the grooming, n trk < 30, is used to discriminate between jets originating from boson decays",

The signal strength, \u03bc, defined as a scale factor on the cross section times branching ratio predicted by the signal hypothesis, is the parameter of interest. The analysis follows the Frequentist approach with a test statistic based on the profile-likelihood ratio [72]. The test statistic extracts information on the signal strength from a binned maximum-likelihood fit of the signal-plus-background model to the data. The effect of a systematic uncertainty k on the likelihood is modelled with a nuisance parameter, \u03b8 k , constrained with a corresponding probability density function f (\u03b8 k ), as explained in the publications corresponding to the individual channels [19,[21][22][23]. In this manner, correlated effects across the different channels are modelled by the use of a common nuisance parameter and its corresponding probability density function. The likelihood model, L, is given by: where the index c represents the analysis channel, and i represents the bin in the invariant mass distribution, n obs , the observed number of events, n sig the number of expected signal events, and n bkg the expected number of background events.

To quantify the loss of sensitivity at a given mass point the value computed with all systematic uncertainties included is compared to the value obtained excluding the single systematic uncertainty.

Fig. 2 shows the p 0 -value obtained in the search for the EGM W and G * as a function of the resonance mass for the \u03bd , qq, \u03bdqq and J J channels combined and for the individual channels. For the full combination the largest deviation from the background-only expectation is found in the EGM W search at around 2.0 TeV with a p 0 -value corresponding to 2.5 standard deviations (\u03c3 ). This is smaller than the p 0 -value of 3.4 \u03c3 observed in the J J channel alone because the \u03bd , qq, and \u03bdqq channels are more consistent with the background-only hypothesis. The compatibility of the individual channels is quantified with the test described in Section 6. In the mass region around 2 TeV the J J channel presents an excess while the other channels are in good agreement with the background-only expectation. For the EGM W benchmark the compatibility of the combined \u03bd , qq, and \u03bdqq channels with the J J channel is at the level of 2.9 \u03c3 . When accounting for the probability for any of the four channels to fluctuate the compatibility is found to be at the level of 2.6 \u03c3 . In comparison the corresponding test for the bulk G * interpretation shows better compatibility. Fig. 3 shows the combined upper limit on the EGM W production cross section times its branching ratio to W Z at the 95% CL in the mass range from 300 GeV to 2.5 TeV.

The searches use 20.3 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Within the combined result, no significant excess over the background-only expectation in the invariant mass distribution of the diboson candidates is observed. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio to dibosons at the 95% CL are evaluated within the context of an extended gauge model with a heavy W boson and a bulk Randall-Sundrum model with a heavy spin-2 graviton. The combination significantly improves both the cross-section limits and the mass limits for EGM W and bulk G * production over the most stringent limits of the individual analyses. The observed lower limit on the EGM W mass is found to be 1.81 TeV and for the bulk G * mass, assuming k/M Pl = 1, the observed limit is 810 GeV. ",

Summaries of the event selection and classification criteria are given inTables 3 and 4.The \u03bd analysis channel is described in detail in Ref.[19].For the purpose of combination the binning of the diboson candidates' invariant mass distribution is adjusted. The \u03bd channel requires exactly three leptons with p T > 25 GeV, of which at least one must be geometrically matched to a lepton reconstructed by a trigger algorithm. Events with additional leptons with p T > 20 GeV are vetoed. At least one pair of oppositely-charged, same-flavour leptons is required to have an invariant mass within the Z mass window |m \u2212 m Z | < 20 GeV. If there are two acceptable combinations satisfying this requirement the combination with the mass value closer to the Z boson mass is chosen as the Z candidate. The event is required to have E miss T > 25 GeV. The W candidate is reconstructed from the third lepton, assuming the neutrino is the only source of E miss T and constraining the ( 3rd , E miss T ) system to have the pole mass of the W . This constraint results in a quadratic equation with two solutions for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino. If the solutions are real, the one with the smaller absolute value is used. If the solutions are complex, the real part is used. To enhance the signal sensitivity, the rapidity difference must satisfy y(W , Z ) < 1.5 and requirements are placed on the azimuthal angle difference \u03c6( 3rd , E miss T ). Exclusive highmass and low-mass regions are defined with \u03c6( 3rd , E miss T ) < 1.5 for boosted W bosons and \u03c6( 3rd , E miss T ) > 1.5 for W bosons at low p T , respectively. The main background sources in the \u03bd channel are SM W Z and Z Z processes with leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons, and are estimated from simulation.

If the event does not satisfy the criteria of the merged region, the resolved region selection criteria are applied. In the high-p T resolved region, two small-R jets with p T > 80 GeV are required to form the hadronically decaying W / Z candidate with a transverse momentum of p T ( jj) > 300 GeV and an invariant mass of 65 GeV < m jj < 105 GeV.

Events that contain one or more leptons with p T > 20 GeV or missing transverse momentum in excess of 350 GeV are vetoed. The large-R jets must satisfy the bosontagging criteria described in Section 4. Furthermore, the dijet p T asymmetry defined as A = (p T1 \u2212 p T2 )/(p T1 + p T2 ) must be less then 0.15 to avoid mis-measured jets. In the search for the EGM W decaying to W Z, events are selected by requiring one W boson candidate and one Z boson candidate in each event by applying the selections described in Section 4. In the search for the bulk G * decaying to W W and Z Z , events are selected by requiring two W boson or two Z boson candidates by applying the selections described in Section 4. Due to the overlapping jet mass windows applied to select W and Z candidates, the selection for the EGM W and the bulk G * are not exclusive and about 20% of the inclusive event sample is shared. In the fully hadronic channel the dominant background is dijet production. The dijet background is estimated by a parametric fit with a smoothly falling function to the observed dijet mass spectrum in the data.Only diboson resonances with mass values > 1.3 TeV are considered as signal for this analysis channel. The selections described above have a combined acceptance times efficiency of up to 17% for G The acceptance times efficiency includes the W and Z branching ratios. Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) summarise the acceptance times efficiency for the different analyses as a function of the W mass and of the G * mass, considering only decays of the resonance into V V , where V denotes a W or a Z boson.",
