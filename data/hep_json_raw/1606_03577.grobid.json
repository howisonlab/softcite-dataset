The data samples used in this study were collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV and have integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb \u22121 and 19.5 fb \u22121 , respectively. A global Bayesian analysis is performed, incorporating results from a broad range of CMS supersymmetry searches, as well as constraints from other experiments. Because the pMSSM incorporates several well-motivated assumptions that reduce the 120 parameters of the MSSM to just 19 parameters defined at the electroweak scale, it is possible to assess the results of the study in a relatively straightforward way. Approximately half of the model points in a potentially accessible subspace of the pMSSM are excluded, including all pMSSM model points with a gluino mass below 500 GeV, as well as models with a squark mass less than 300 GeV. Models with chargino and neutralino masses below 200 GeV are disfavored, but no mass range of model points can be ruled out based on the analyses considered. The nonexcluded regions in the pMSSM parameter space are characterized in terms of physical processes and key observables, and implications for future searches are discussed.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6] is a strongly motivated candidate for physics beyond the standard model (SM). Searches for the superpartner particles (sparticles) predicted by SUSY performed in a variety of channels at the CERN LHC at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV have been reported [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The results, found to be consistent with the SM, are interpreted as limits on SUSY parameters, based mostly on models with restricted degrees of freedom, such as the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (cMSSM) [19][20][21][22][23][24][25], or, more recently, within the simplified model spectra (SMS) approach [26][27][28]. The cMSSM models feature specific relations among the soft-breaking terms at some mediation scale that translate into specific mass patterns typical for the model. While this problem is avoided in the SMS approach, the signatures of realistic models cannot always be fully covered by SMS topologies. This holds true, for instance, in the case of long decay chains that do not correspond to any SMS, t-channel exchanges of virtual sparticles in production, or the presence of multiple production modes that overlap in kinematic distributions.",

Here, R-parity is a Z 2 symmetry ensuring the conservation of lepton and baryon numbers [30], which suppresses proton decay and results in the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) being stable. In the pMSSM, all MSSM parameters are specified at the electroweak (EW) scale, and allowed to vary freely, subject to the requirement that the model remain consistent with EW symmetry breaking (EWSB) and other basic constraints. Since the pMSSM incorporates neither relations among SUSY-breaking terms at a high scale, nor large correlations among sparticle masses from renormalization group evolution, it allows a much broader set of scenarios than those in, for example, the cMSSM and related grand unified theories (GUTs). Many of these scenarios are difficult to constrain using current LHC data, despite some having small sparticle masses.",

We use results from hadronic searches, both general searches and those targeting top squark production; also included are searches with leptonic final states, both general and EW-targeted. For a selected set of pMSSM parameter points, event samples were simulated using the CMS fast detector simulation [31] and analyzed. Since the fast detector simulation does not accurately model the detector response to massive long-lived charged particles, and since it was not feasible to use the CMS full simulation [32] given the large number of model points, we work within a subspace of the pMSSM in which the chargino proper decay lifetime c\u03c4 ( \u03c7 \u00b1 ) is less than 10 mm. This constraint restricts the class of final states considered to those with prompt decays. The 7 and 8 TeV data are treated consistently; in particular, we use the same set of points in the pMSSM model phase space, chosen randomly from a larger set of points that are consistent with pre-LHC experimental results and basic theoretical constraints. This approach greatly facilitates the combination of the results from the 7 and 8 TeV (Run 1) data.",

Therefore, a few reasonable assumptions about the flavor and CP structure allow a factor of six reduction in the number of free parameters, without imposing any specific SUSY breaking mechanism. This has the virtue of avoiding relations, which need not hold in general, between the soft terms introduced by models of SUSY breaking.",

Likewise, first and second generation spartners of left-handed charged leptons are nearly degenerate with the corresponding sneutrinos. The nature of the spectrum of neutralinos and charginos depends on the relative magnitudes and separation of the pMSSM parameters M 1 , M 2 and \u00b5. If these scales are well separated, then the approximate eigenstates will divide into a single bino-like state with mass of order M 1 , a wino-like triplet consisting of two charginos and one neutralino with masses of order M 2 , and a higgsino-like quartet of two charginos and two neutralinos with masses of order \u00b5.

This calculation includes 1-loop corrections for sparticle masses and mixings, as well as 2-loop corrections for the small Higgs boson mass. Lowenergy constraints are calculated with SuperIso v3.3 [58]. micrOMEGAs 2.4.5 [54][55][56] is used to check the compatibility of pMSSM points with sparticle mass limits from LEP and other pre-LHC experiments. micrOMEGAs is also used to compute the DM relic density, and the spin-dependent and spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross sections; these observables are not used in the construction of the prior, but we study how they are impacted by the CMS searches. The program sdecay 1.3 [59] is used to generate sparticle decay tables and hdecay 5.11 [60] to generate Higgs boson decay tables. For evaluating the Higgs boson signal likelihood based on the latest ATLAS [61] and CMS [62] measurements, we use Lilith 1.01 [51,52], following the approach explained in section 2.3 of ref. [63]. The experimental results used in Lilith are the signal strengths of the Higgs boson decay modes Y = (\u03b3\u03b3, WW * , ZZ * , bb, \u03c4 \u03c4 ) in terms of the primary Higgs boson production modes gluon-gluon fusion (ggF), vector boson fusion (VBF), associated production with a W or Z boson (Wh and Zh, commonly denoted as Vh), and associated production with a top-quark pair (tth) as published by ATLAS, CMS, and Tevatron experiments. When these signal strengths are given as 2-dimensional (2D) confidence level (CL) contours in, e.g., the \u00b5 ggF+tth (Y ) versus \u00b5 VBF+Vh (Y ) plane, the likelihood is reconstructed by fitting a 2D Gaussian function to the 68% CL contour provided by the experiments.

Overall, the impact of the 7 TeV combined result is relatively small as indicated by the high peak around zero. The dip around zero in the combined 7+8 TeV distribution arises from the way we combine Z-significances. As expressed in eq. (3.9), the maximum Z-significance values are used in the combination. Figure 2 shows the impact of the CMS searches on our knowledge of the gluino mass. Posterior distributions obtained using three signal strength modifier values \u00b5 = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 illustrate the effect of a \u00b150% systematic uncertainty in the predicted SUSY signal yields. Since the uncertainty in the signal efficiency typically varies between 10 and 25%, and the uncertainty in the signal cross section ranges between 30 and 50%, this prescription is considered to be conservative. Figure 2 (top-left) shows the strong impact of the inclusive analyses on the gluino mass distribution. The H T +H miss T search strongly disfavors the region below 1200 GeV, while the M T2 search leads to a distribution with two regions of peaking probability, one at relatively low mass, around 600 to 1000 GeV, and one above 1200 GeV. In figure 2 (top-center) we observe that the other hadronic analyses also disfavor the low-mass region, though to a lesser degree, and two of these analyses (the H T +E miss T +bjets and the hadronic third generation) also exhibit secondary preferred regions around 1100 GeV, while figure 2 (top-right) shows that the EW, OS dilepton, and LS dilepton searches have little impact on the gluino mass distribution. Figure 2 (bottom-left) compares the prior distribution to posterior distributions after inclusion of the combined 7 TeV and combined 7+8 TeV data. The 7 TeV data already have sufficient sensitivity to exclude much of the low-mass gluino model space, and the 8 TeV data further strengthen this result.",

            "text": "Figures 3 and 4 similarly summarize the impact of searches on the first-and secondgeneration left-handed up squark mass and the mass of the lightest colored SUSY particle (LCSP), respectively. The picture is similar to that for the gluino mass. For both u L and the LCSP, the M T2 search shows a preference for masses from 500 to 1100 GeV. The overall impact of the searches on u L is less than the impact on the gluino mass owing to the more diverse gluino decay structure that can be accessed by a greater number of searches. For the LCSP, the overall impact is the least because the LCSP has the fewest decay channels; nevertheless, CMS searches exclude about 98% of the approximately 3000 model points -12 - with an LCSP mass below 300 GeV; in the surviving 2% of these model points, the LCSP is theD R . We also see that the searches can be sensitive to scenarios with LCSP masses up to \u223c1500 GeV. Again we find that the Higgs boson results make a negligible contribution. In each case we find a negative correlation between the Z-significance and the sparticle mass for positive Z values and masses below 1200 GeV; this is most pronounced for the LCSP. Figure 5 illustrates what information this set of searches provides about the mass of the lightest top squark t 1 . The difference between the prior and posterior distributions is minor. The reason is that the low-energy measurements like the b \u2192 s \u03b3 branching fraction (see table 1) impose much stronger constraints on the mass of the t 1 than do the considered analyses. This is not to say the CMS analyses are insensitive to top squark masses. The posterior distribution for the M T2 search exhibits an enhancement at m t 1 < 1 TeV relative to the non-DCS distribution. This enhancement does not appear in the combined posterior density because is suppressed by observations of other more sensitive searches. In the distribution of m t 1 versus Z, the positive (negative) Z values have a slight negative (positive) correlation with the t 1 mass below 1 TeV, indicating that the CMS analyses considered have some direct sensitivity to top squarks with masses up to 1 TeV. The overall conclusion is that light top squarks with masses of the order of 500 GeV cannot be excluded.  Turning now to the EW sector, we first show, in figure 6, the effect of the considered searches on our knowledge of the mass of the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 . We see that the hadronic inclusive searches disfavor low \u03c7 0 masses; the hadronic searches targeting specific topologies also have an effect, although smaller, and the leptonic searches have a marginal impact. The 7+8 TeV combined distribution is very similar to the M T2 distribution, especially in the lower mass region, indicating that this search is the most sensitive to the \u03c7 0 mass. The main constraint on the \u03c7 0 mass arises indirectly through correlations with other sparticle masses. Since \u03c7 0 is the LSP, its mass is constrained by the masses of the heavier sparticles. As CMS searches push the probability distributions for the colored particles to higher values, more phase space opens for \u03c7 0 and the \u03c7 0 distributions shift to higher values. The survival probability distribution shows that no \u03c7 0 mass is totally excluded at the 95% CL by CMS. In general, the nonexcluded points with light \u03c7 0 are those with heavy colored sparticles. The fact that the survival probability decreases below a \u03c7 0 mass of \u223c700 GeV shows that CMS searches are sensitive up to this mass value. The Higgs boson data disfavor neutralino masses below about 60 GeV, that is, the mass range in which invisible decays h \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 1 could occur; this is visible in the first bin in figure 6 (bottom-left) (see ref. [51]). In the MSSM, the lightest chargino becomes degenerate with the lightest neutralino for the condition |M 1 | \u2265 min(|M 2 |, |\u00b5|). Therefore, we define the lightest non-degenerate (LND) chargino as",

Again, the impact of the CMS searches is found to be rather limited and no chargino mass can be reliably excluded. It is worth noticing the impact of the leptonic searches. In figure 7 (top-right), the distributions differ from the non-DCS distribution, while these searches have negligible impact on most of the other SUSY observables and parameters considered in this study. We also note that the survival probability is lowest in the first bin where the LND \u03c7 \u00b1 mass is between 0 and 200 GeV, but a small percentage of points still survive. A more generic view is possible by looking at the overall CMS impact on the inclusive SUSY production cross section for 8 TeV, which is shown in figure 8. total sparticle cross section in non-DCS prior is approximately 100 fb; the low tail of this distribution is shaped by the upper limits on the masses of sparticles in the prior. The effect of the CMS SUSY searches is to reduce this value by an order of magnitude. The inclusive H T +H miss T search has the largest individual contribution to this because of its ability to address a great diversity of final states comprising different sparticle compositions. The survival probability distribution confirms that CMS is sensitive to SUSY scenarios with total cross sections as low as 1 fb.",

We first note that the impact of the CMS data on the first and second generation right-handed up squarks is lower than on the corresponding left-handed up squarks (figure 3). This is because left-handed up squarks in the MSSM form doublets with mass-degenerate left-handed down squarks, while the righthanded up and down squarks are singlets and their masses are unrelated. Therefore, for the left-handed up squarks, the CMS sensitivity for a given mass is increased by the left-handed down squarks, which have the same mass. We also observe a mild impact on the bottom squark mass, where CMS disfavors masses below 400 GeV.  some sensitivity to the selectron and stau masses, which comes from the leptonic searches. The impact on \u03c7 0 i 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 masses is larger, mostly due to the dedicated EW analyses. The CMS SUSY searches have no impact on the masses of the light and heavy pseudoscalar Higgs bosons. The preference of the Higgs data for negative values of the higgsino mass parameter \u00b5 comes primarily from the fact that the measured signal strength normalized to its SM value for Vh \u2192 bb (where V is a W or a Z boson) is currently slightly below one. In a SUSY model, this requires that radiative corrections reduce the bottom Yukawa coupling, thereby creating a preference for \u00b5 < 0 [63]. The tan \u03b2 distribution is largely unaffected by both the CMS SUSY searches and the current Higgs boson data evaluated via Lilith 1.01.",

To this end, we decompose the nonexcluded subspace into the dominant physical processes and follow with an idealized analysis of final state observables. For the decomposition, signal events are analyzed at the generator level for each model point, and the pair of SUSY particles most frequently produced directly from the protonproton interaction is taken as the production mode for that model point. Then the principal (dominant) process for that point is built as a tree diagram starting from the pair of SUSY mother particles and following the decay modes with the highest branching fractions until endpoints consisting of only SM particles and LSPs are reached. Indices of particle charge, flavor, and chirality are ignored in the construction, with the exception of the flavor of the third-generation squarks and quarks.

Marginalized non-DCS distributions (first column), compared with posterior distributions (second column) and survival probabilities (third column) after inclusion of the considered CMS searches, are shown for the \u03c7 0 1 mass versus gluino mass (first row), the LCSP mass (second row), the top squark mass (third row), and the logarithm of the cross section for inclusive sparticle production at 8 TeV (bottom row). ino production (2, 3, and 10) survive with a higher frequency than they are excluded. Processes with first-generation squark production (1 and 7) survive and are excluded at similar rates, and processes with slepton production (12) have exceptionally high survival rates. These trends are likely attributable to the difference in the production cross section between colored and noncolored particles for a given SUSY mass scale. The overflow bin (other), which contains many principal processes, including modes of colored and noncolored particle production, indicates a survival rate approximately equal to the exclusion rate. The dominance is defined for each model point as the ratio of the cross section of the principal process to the total SUSY production cross section at 8 TeV,   Figure 13.

We examine a set of final-state observables that loosely correspond to trigger thresholds or signal regions of the examined searches. Figures 15-17 show the impact of adjusting various thresholds on the fiducial cross sections of nonexcluded points. Some principal processes can be associated with large fiducial cross sections, depending on the final state considered. For example, points with mostly first-generation squark production give rise to large fiducial cross sections for events with high H T , resulting in figure 16 showing mostly orange-colored points; and points with production involving EW gauginos give rise to substantial fiducial cross sections for events with a high multiplicity of soft leptons, which explains the unaccompanied blue and green lines in figure 17. Somewhat striking is the behavior of the E miss T fiducial cross section (figure 15), which can increase rapidly (by up to a factor of ten) as the threshold is relaxed from 200 to 100 GeV. It is apparent that many of the nonexcluded regions are not accessible with thresholds of 200 GeV, a common criterion applied offline to achieve full efficiency with the triggers. The fiducial cross section decreases noticeably as the threshold is further increased from 200 to 300 GeV. Similar behavior is seen for the H T fiducial cross section (figure 16). Fiducial cross sections are quite large for these final states when a threshold of 300 GeV is applied, but fall off substantially for higher thresholds.  Figure 16.

            "text": "The impact of a representative set of the 7 and 8 TeV CMS SUSY searches on a potentially accessible subspace of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) has been investigated. The subspace of the pMSSM is defined by restricting the ranges of the 19 pMSSM parameters to values that are either physically motivated or that correspond to models that are potentially accessible in the long-term LHC program. An additional restriction is imposed that the lightest chargino decay promptly or with a lifetime that leads to at most a short decay length in the detector. The set of searches, taken individually and in combination, include those with all-hadronic final states, like-sign and opposite-sign charged leptons, and multiple leptons in configurations sensitive to electroweak production of superpartner particles. They are found to exclude all analyzed pMSSM points with a gluino mass less than 500 GeV (approximately 250 of the 7200 sample points), and 98% of scenarios in which the lightest colored supersymmetric particle is less than 300 GeV. While the sensitivity of searches to top squarks extends up to mt 1 \u2248 700 GeV, the overall impact on the top squark mass is small because the region of highest sensitivity, mt 1 500 GeV, is already suppressed by the results of previous experiments, such as the measurement of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 branching fraction. Neutralino and chargino masses less than 300 GeV are significantly disfavored, but not ruled out, by the CMS data. Measurements of the Higgs boson mass and signal strengths are included in this study, but add little to the model constraints.",

Of the surviving points, about half have cross sections greater than 10 fb, and some have cross sections greater than 1 pb. Most high cross section points correspond to electroweak gaugino production with mass splittings between the second-lightest and the lightest SUSY particle less than 3 GeV. Nonexcluded model points with low-mass gluinos correspond to processes involving intermediate electroweak gauginos that are nearly degenerate with the lightest SUSY particle. The surviving points evade the experimental constraints largely because they overlap with the kinematical parameter space of more copiously produced standard model processes. Some of these may be probed by future searches that target the nonexcluded processes detailed in section 5, benefiting as well from the higher energy and luminosity of the LHC. Open Access.
