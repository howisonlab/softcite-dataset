            "text": "The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of\u03bde appearance data from 11.27 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target in antineutrino mode, an increase of approximately a factor of two over the previously reported results. An event excess of 78.4 \u00b1 28.5 events (2.8\u03c3) is observed in the energy range 200 < E QE \u03bd < 1250 MeV. If interpreted in a two-neutrino oscillation model, \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192\u03bde, the best oscillation fit to the excess has a probability of 66% while the background-only fit has a \u03c7 2 -probability of 0.5% relative to the best fit. The data are consistent with antineutrino oscillations in the 0.01 < \u2206m 2 < 1.0 eV 2 range and have some overlap with the evidence for antineutrino oscillations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND). All of the major backgrounds are constrained by in-situ event measurements so non-oscillation explanations would need to invoke new anomalous background processes. The neutrino mode running also shows an excess at low energy of 162.0 \u00b1 47.8 events (3.4\u03c3) but the energy distribution of the excess is marginally compatible with a simple two neutrino oscillation formalism. Expanded models with several sterile neutrinos can reduce the incompatibility by allowing for CP violating effects between neutrino and antineutrino oscillations.",

            "text": "There is growing evidence for short-baseline neutrino anomalies occurring at an L/E \u03bd \u223c 1 m/MeV, where E \u03bd is the neutrino energy and L is the distance that the neutrino travelled before detection. These anomalies include the excess of events observed by the LSND [1] and Mini-BooNE [2][3][4] experiments and the deficit of events observed by reactor [5] and radioactive-source experiments [6]. There have been several attempts to interpret these anomalies in terms of 3+N neutrino oscillation models involving three active neutrinos and N additional sterile neutrinos [7][8][9][10][11][12]. (Other explanations include, for example, Lorentz violation [13] and sterile neutrino decay [14].) A main goal of MiniBooNE was to confirm or refute the evidence for neutrino oscillations from LSND. Of particular importance is the MiniBooNE search for\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e oscillations since this was the channel where LSND observed an apparent signal. This paper presents improved results and an oscillation analysis of the Mini-BooNE\u03bd e appearance data, corresponding to 11.27\u00d710 20 POT in antineutrino mode, which is approximately twice the antineutrino data reported previously [4].",

In neutrino (antineutrino) mode, positively (negatively) charged mesons produced in p-Be interactions are focused in the forward direction and subsequently decay primarily into \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ). The flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors is simulated using information from external measurements [15]. In neutrino mode, the \u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e , and\u03bd e flux contributions at the detector are 93.5%, 5.9%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively.

The \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 fluxes peak at approximately 600 MeV and 400 MeV, respectively. The MiniBooNE detector is described in detail in reference [16]. The detector is located 541 m from the beryllium target and consists of a 40-foot diameter sphere filled with 806 tons of pure mineral oil (CH 2 ). Neutrino interactions in the detector produce charged particles (electrons, muons, protons, pions, and kaons) which in turn produce scintillation and Cherenkov light detected by the 1520 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that line the interior of the detector and an optically isolated outer veto region. Event reconstruction and particle identification are derived from the hit PMT charge and time information. In particular, the reconstructed neutrino energy, E QE \u03bd , uses the measured energy and angle of the outgoing muon or electron assuming chargedcurrent quasi-elastic (CCQE) kinematics for the event.",

Reconstruction [17] and selection requirements of these events are almost identical to those from previous analyses [3,4] with an average reconstruction efficiency of \u223c 10 \u2212 15% for events generated over the entire volume of the detector. Recent improvements to the analysis include a better determination of the intrinsic \u03bd e background from K + decay through the measurement of high-energy neutrino events in the SciBooNE experiment [18], a better determination of NC \u03c0 0 and external event backgrounds in antineutrino mode due to the increase in statistics of the antineutrino mode data sample, and the use of a likelihood fit with frequentist corrections from fake data studies for both the neutrino-mode and antineutrino-mode analyses. The detector cannot distinguish between neutrino and antineutrino interactions on an event-by-event basis. However, the fraction of CCQE events in antineutrino (neutrino) mode that are due to wrong-sign neutrino (antineutrino) events was determined from the angular distributions of muons created in CCQE interactions and by measuring CC single \u03c0 + events [19].",

MiniBooNE does not have the electron versus gamma particle identification capabilities to determine whether observed events are due to charged-current (CC) electron events, as expected for an oscillation signal or intrinsic beam \u03bd e /\u03bd e background, or to background gamma events from neutral-current (NC) interactions in the detector or interactions in the external surrounding material. The estimated size of the intrinsic \u03bd e and gamma backgrounds are tied to Mini-BooNE event measurements and uncertainties due to these constraints are included in the analysis. The intrinsic \u03bd e /\u03bd e background from muon decay is directly related to the large sample of observed \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 events since these events constrain the muons that decay in the 50 m decay region. (The \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 CCQE data sample, in the 200 < E QE \u03bd < 1900 MeV energy range, includes 115,467 and 50,456 neutrino and antineutrino events, respectively .) This constraint is accomplished using a joint fit of the observed \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 events and the \u03bd e /\u03bd e events assuming that there are no substantial \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 disappearance oscillations. The other intrinsic background \u03bd e component from K-decay is constrained by fits to kaon production data and the recent SciBooNE measurements [18]. Other backgrounds from mis-identified \u03bd \u00b5 or\u03bd \u00b5 [20,21] events are also constrained by the observed CCQE sample. The gamma background from NC \u03c0 0 production mainly from \u2206 decay or \u2206 \u2192 N \u03b3 radiative decay [22] is constrained by the associated large two-gamma data sample (mainly from \u2206 production) observed in the MiniBooNE data [23]. In effect, an in-situ NC \u03c0 0 rate is measured and applied to the analysis. Single-gamma backgrounds from external neutrino interactions (\"dirt\" backgrounds) are estimated using topological and spatial cuts to isolate these events whose vertex is near the edge of the detector and point towards the detector center [3].",

These include uncertainties in the neutrino and antineutrino flux estimates, uncertainties in neutrino cross sections, most of which are determined by in-situ cross-section measurements at MiniBooNE [20,23], uncertainties due to nuclear effects, and uncertainties in detector modeling and reconstruction. A covariance matrix in bins of E QE \u03bd is constructed by considering the variation from each source of systematic uncertainty on the \u03bd e and\u03bd e CCQE signal, background, and \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 CCQE prediction as a function of E QE \u03bd .

For assessing the probability that the expectation fluctuates up to this 478 observed value, the excess is then 78.4 \u00b1 28.5 events or a 2.8\u03c3 effect. Fig. 2 (top) shows the event excess as a function of E QE \u03bd in antineutrino mode. Many checks have been performed on the data, including beam and detector stability checks that show that the neutrino event rates are stable to < 2% and that the detector energy response is stable to < 1% over the entire run. In addition, the fractions of neutrino and antineutrino events are stable over energy and time, and the inferred external event rate corrections are similar in both neutrino and antineutrino modes.",

The oscillation parameters are extracted from a combined fit of the observed E QE \u03bd event distributions for muon-like and electron-like events. The fit assumes the same oscillation probability for both the right-sign\u03bd e and wrong-sign \u03bd e , and no significant \u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e , or\u03bd e disappearance. Using a likelihood-ratio technique [4], the confidence level values for the fitting statistic, \u2206\u03c7 2 = \u03c7 2 (point) \u2212 \u03c7 2 (best), as a function of oscillation parameters, \u2206m 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8, is determined from frequentist, fake data studies. The critical values over the oscillation parameter space are typically 2.0, the number of fit parameters, but can be as a low as 1.0 at small sin 2 2\u03b8 or large \u2206m 2 . With this technique, the best antineutrino oscillation fit for 200 < E QE \u03bd < 3000 MeV occurs at (\u2206m 2 , sin 2 2\u03b8) = (0.043 eV 2 , 0.88) but there is little change in probability in a broad region up to (\u2206m 2 , sin 2 2\u03b8) = (0.8 eV 2 , 0.004) as shown in Fig. 3 (top). In the neutrino oscillation energy range of 200 < E QE \u03bd < 1250 MeV, the \u03c7 2 /ndf for the above antineutrino-mode best-fit point is 5.0/7.0 with a probability of 66%. The background-only fit has a \u03c7 2 -probability of 0.5% relative to the best oscillation fit and a \u03c7 2 /ndf = 16.6/8.9 with a probability of 5.4%. Fig. 3 (top) shows the MiniBooNE closed confidence level (CL) contours for \u03bd e and\u03bd e appearance oscillations in antineutrino mode in the 200 < E QE \u03bd < 3000 MeV energy range. The data indicate an oscillation signal region at the greater than 99% CL with respect to a no oscillation hypothesis, which is consistent with some parts of the LSND 99% CL allowed region and consistent with the limits from the KARMEN experiment [24].",

The prediction was implemented by smearing the input neutrino energies as a function of reconstructed energy to mimic the behavior of the model. For an estimate of the effects of disappearance oscillations, a (3+1) type model was used. Fits were performed where the appearance \u2206m 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 app parameters were varied as usual but disappearance oscillations were also included with |U e4 | 2 = |U \u00b54 | 2 = |U | 2 = sin 2 2\u03b8 app /4 and with the same \u2206m 2 . This is a disappearance model where all four types of neutrinos (\u03bd e /\u03bd e /\u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 ) disappear with the same effective sin 2 2\u03b8 disapp = 4(1 \u2212 U 2 )U 2 . A comparison of the results for these models versus the nominal MiniBooNE analysis is given in Table II. Results are presented for the best fit with the given prediction model and for a test point with \u2206m 2 = 0.5 eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 = 0.01. The difference in \u03c7 2 values for the different prediction models is < 0.5 units, suggesting that multinucleon or disappearance effects do not significantly change the oscillation fit and null exclusion probabilities.",

The previous MiniBooNE oscillation analysis [2] found no evidence for neutrino oscillations in neutrino mode by fitting over the neutrino energy range 475 < E QE \u03bd < 3000 MeV, excluding the low-energy range, 200 < E QE \u03bd < 475 MeV. The reason for excluding the low-energy region in the original analysis was based on uncertainties for the large gamma background in that Two-neutrino oscillation model fits to the MiniBooNE neutrino-mode data do show indications of oscillations as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom). In contrast to the antineutrino-mode results, the MiniBooNE favored neutrino-mode region has only small overlap with the LSND region and may indicate that the compatibility between the two is low in a simple two-neutrino model. The best neutrino oscillation fit occurs at (\u2206m 2 , sin 2 2\u03b8) = (3.14 eV 2 , 0.002). In the neutrino oscillation energy range of 200 < E QE \u03bd < 1250 MeV, the \u03c7 2 /ndf for the best-fit point is 13.2/6.8 with a fairly small probability of 6.1%, and the background-only fit has a \u03c7 2probability of 2% relative to the best oscillation fit and a \u03c7 2 /ndf = 22.8/8.8 with a probability of 0.5%. As shown in Fig. 2 (bottom), the poor \u03c7 2 /ndf for the neutrinomode best fit is due to the data being higher than the expectation at low energy and lower at high energy. This may be due to the limitation of the simple two-neutrino model if the excess is due to oscillations or to some anomalous background at low energy if the excess is related to backgrounds.",
