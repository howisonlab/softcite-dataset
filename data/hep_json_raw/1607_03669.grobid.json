The search uses 3.2 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data, collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015. The dilepton invariant mass is used as the discriminating variable. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed; therefore limits are set on the signal model parameters of interest at 95% credibility level. Upper limits are set on the crosssection times branching ratio for resonances decaying to dileptons, and the limits are converted into lower limits on the resonance mass, ranging between 2.74 TeV and 3.36 TeV, depending on the model. Lower limits on the qq contact interaction scale are set between 16.7 TeV and 25.2 TeV, also depending on the model.",

            "text": "Models with extended gauge groups often feature additional U (1) symmetries with corresponding heavy spin-1 Z bosons whose decays would manifest themselves as narrow resonances in the dilepton mass spectrum. Grand Unified Theories (GUT) have inspired models based on the E 6 gauge group [1,2], which, for a particular choice of symmetry-breaking pattern, includes two neutral gauge bosons that mix with an angle \u03b8 E 6 . This yields a physical state defined by Z (\u03b8 E 6 ) = Z \u03c8 cos \u03b8 E 6 + Z \u03c7 sin \u03b8 E 6 , where the gauge fields Z \u03c8 and Z \u03c7 are associated with two separate U (1) groups resulting from the breaking of the E 6 symmetry. All Z signals in this model are defined by specific values of \u03b8 E 6 ranging from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0 , and the six commonly motivated cases are investigated in this search, namely Z \u03c8 , Z \u03b7 , Z N , Z I , Z S , and Z \u03c7 . The widths of these states vary from 0.5% to 1.2% of the resonance mass, respectively. In addition to the GUT-inspired E 6 models, the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [2] provides a common benchmark model that includes a Z SSM boson with couplings to fermions identical to those of the SM Z boson. This search is also sensitive to a series of models that predict the presence of narrow dilepton res-E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch.",

Some models of physics beyond the SM result in non-resonant deviations from the predicted SM dilepton mass spectrum.

The inner tracking detector (ID) covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The total thickness of the EM calorimeter is more than twenty radiation lengths. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large superconducting air-core toroids with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T \u2022 m for most of the detector. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A dedicated trigger system is used to select events.

The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [23] is used for properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. Photos++ version 3.52 [24] is used for Quantum Electrodynamic (QED) emissions from electroweak vertices and charged leptons. Event yields are corrected with a mass-dependent rescaling to next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) in the QCD coupling constant, computed with VRAP 0.9 [25] and the CT14NNLO PDF set [26]. The NNLO QCD corrections are a factor of \u223c 0.98 at m = 3 TeV. Massdependent electroweak (EW) corrections are computed at NLO with Mcsanc 1.20 [27]. The NLO EW corrections are a factor of \u223c 0.86 at m = 3 TeV. Those include photon-induced contributions (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 via t-and u-channel processes) computed with the MRST2004QED PDF set [28].",

In the case of Z production, interference effects (such as with DY production) are not included. However, for the production of non-resonant signal events, both the DY and CI events are generated together in the same sample to account for the significant interference effects between those two processes. Higher-order QCD corrections are computed as for the DY background and applied to both the resonant and non-resonant MC samples. EW corrections are not applied to the resonant MC samples due to the large model dependence. However, these corrections are applied to the non-resonant MC samples as they involve interference between the DY and CI processes. Moreover, including the EW corrections leads to a more conservative estimate when setting exclusion limits. The generator settings and corrections described here are also used to compute the signal cross-sections and branching ratios.",

[42]. The transition region between the central and forward regions of the calorimeters, in the range 1.37 \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 1.52, exhibits degraded energy resolution and is therefore excluded. A likelihood discriminant is built to suppress electron candidates resulting from hadronic jets, photon conversions, Dalitz decays and semileptonic heavy-flavour hadron decays. The likelihood discriminant utilises lateral and longitudinal shower shape, tracking and cluster-track matching quantities. Several operating points are defined for the likelihood discrimination, as described in Ref. [42]. In this analysis, the Medium working point is used in the search, and the Very Loose and Loose working points are used in the data-driven background estimation described in Section 5. In addition to the likelihood discriminant, selection criteria based on track quality are applied. The selection efficiency smoothly decreases from 96% to 95% for electrons with transverse energy (E T ) between 500 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The selection efficiency modelling is evaluated in the data using a tag-and-probe method [43] up to E T of 500 GeV and the uncertainties due to the modelling of the shower shape variables are evaluated as described in Section 6. The electron energy scale and resolution has been calibrated up to E T of 500 GeV using data taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV [44]. The energy resolution for high-E T electrons is approximately 1%. To suppress background from misidentified jets as well as from light-and heavy-flavour hadron decays inside jets, electrons are required to satisfy the calorimeter-based and track-based isolation criteria with a fixed efficiency of 99% over the full range of electron momentum. The calorimeter-based isolation relies on the ratio of the total energy deposited in a cone of size R = 0.2 centred at the electron cluster barycentre to the electron E T . Likewise, the track-based isolation relies on the ratio of the scalar sum of transverse momenta of tracks within a cone of size R = 10 GeV/p T to the transverse momentum (p T ) of the electron track. The tracks are required to originate from the primary vertex (defined as the vertex with the highest sum of track p 2 T ), have p T > 1 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and meet track quality criteria.",

The two tracks are then used as input to a combined fit which takes into account the energy loss in the calorimeter and multiple-scattering effects. The ID track used for the combined fit is required to be within the ID acceptance, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and to have a minimum number of hits in each ID sub-system. Muon candidates in the overlap of the MS barrel and endcap region (1.01 < |\u03b7| < 1.10) are rejected due to the potential for p T mismeasurement resulting from relative barrel-endcap misalignment. In order to reduce the background from light-and heavy-hadron decays inside jets, muons are required to fulfil relative track-based isolation requirements with a fixed efficiency of 99%, as defined above for electron candidates. The selected muon candidates must also pass near the primary interaction point in the z coordinate to suppress cosmic-ray background. Since momentum resolution is a key ingredient of this analysis, muon tracks are required to have at least three hits in each of three precision chambers in the MS and not to traverse regions of the MS which are poorly aligned. This requirement reduces the muon reconstruction efficiency by about 20% for muons with a p T greater than 1.5 TeV. Finally, the q/p (charge divided by momentum) measurements performed independently in the ID and MS must agree within seven standard deviations, calculated from the sum in quadrature of the ID and MS momentum uncertainties.",

The contribution from these processes is estimated simultaneously with a data-driven technique, the matrix method, described in Ref. [10]. In this technique, probabilities for electrons and jets to pass electron candidate selection are used. Probabilities of electron identification are estimated from MC simulated DY samples in several bins of E T and |\u03b7|. Probabilities of jet misidentification as an electron in different E T bins are estimated in data samples triggered on the presence of a Very Loose or a Loose electron candidate. The estimate is extrapolated by fitting a smooth function to the m ee distribution between 150 and 600 GeV to mitigate effects of limited event counts in the high-mass region and method instability in the Z peak region. The uncertainties in this background estimate are evaluated by considering differences in the estimates for events with same-charge and opposite-charge electrons as well as by varying the electron identification probabilities and changing the parameters of the extrapolation functions.",

They arise from the PDF eigenvector variations of the nominal PDF set, as well as variations of PDF scale, \u03b1 S , EW corrections, and photon-induced (PI) corrections. The effects of different PDF set choices are also considered. The theoretical uncertainties are the same at generator level for the dielectron and dimuon channels, but result in different uncertainties at reconstruction level, due to the differing resolutions between the two channels. The PDF variation uncertainty is obtained using the 90% C.L. CT14NNLO PDF error set and by following the procedure described in Refs. [10,47,48]. Rather than using a single nuisance parameter to describe the 28 eigenvectors of this PDF error set, which could lead to an underestimation of its effect, a re-diagonalised set of 7 PDF eigenvectors was used [26], which are treated as separate nuisance parameters. The sum in quadrature of these eigenvectors matches the original CT14NNLO error envelope well. The uncertainties due to the variation of PDF scale and \u03b1 S are derived using VRAP with the former obtained by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales of the nominal CT14NNLO PDF up and down simultaneously by a factor of two. The value of \u03b1 S used (0.118) is varied by \u00b1 0.003. The EW correction uncertainty was assessed by comparing the nominal additive (1 + \u03b4 EW + \u03b4 QCD ) treatment with the multiplicative approximation ((1 + \u03b4 EW )(1 + \u03b4 QCD )) treatment of the EW correction in the combination of the higher-order EW and QCD effects. The uncertainty in the photon-induced correction is calculated based on the uncertainty of the quark masses and the photon PDF. An additional uncertainty is derived due to the choice of nominal PDF set, by comparing the central values of CT14NNLO with those from other PDF sets as recommended by the PDF4LHC forum [48], namely MMHT14 [49] and NNPDF3.0 [50]. The maximum absolute deviation from the envelope of these comparisons is used as the PDF choice uncertainty, where it is larger than the CT14NNLO PDF eigenvector variation envelope. Theoretical uncertainties are not applied to the signal prediction in the statistical interpretation.",

To perform the LLR search, the HistFactory [52] package, together with RooStats [53] and RooFit [54] packages are used. The p-value for finding a Z \u03c7 signal excess (at a given pole mass) more significant than the observed, is computed analytically using a test statistic based on the logarithm of the profile likelihood ratio \u03bb(\u03bc) which includes a treatment of the systematic uncertainties. The parameter \u03bc is defined as a ratio of the signal production cross-section times branching ratio to the dilepton final state (\u03c3 B) to its theoretically predicted value. The test statistic is modified for signal masses below 800 GeV to also quantify the significance of potential deficits in the data. The analytical calculation of p-values is cross-checked using MC simulations. Multiple mass hypotheses are tested in pole-mass steps corresponding to the histogram bin width to compute the local p-values -that is p-values corresponding to specific signal mass hypotheses Pseudo-experiments are used to estimate the distribution of the lowest local p-value in the absence of any signal. The p-value to find anywhere in the m distribution (120-6000 GeV) an excess more significant than the one in the data (global p-value) is then computed. The BumpHunter method [55] is also used in a modelindependent search for an excess in all consecutive intervals in the m histogram spanning from one bin to half of the bins in the histogram. The same binning as in the LLR search is used.",

The logarithmic m histogram binning shown in Fig. 1 uses 66 mass bins and is chosen for setting limits on resonant signals using Z \u03c7 signal templates. For setting the limits on the CI interaction scale , the m mass distribution uses eight mass bins above 400 GeV with bin widths varying from 100 to 1500 GeV. The prior probability is chosen to be uniform and positive in the cross-section for the Z limit calculation and 1/ 2 or 1/ 4 for the CI limit calculation. For the CI limit calculation, these choices of the prior are selected to study the cases where the dilepton production cross-section is dominated by the interference terms and where it is dominated by the pure contact interaction term. The upper (lower) 95% percentile of the posterior probability is then quoted as the upper (lower) 95% credibility-level limit on \u03c3 B ( ). The above calculations are performed with the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) [56], which uses a Markov Chain MC technique to integrate over the nuisance parameters. Limit values obtained using the experimental data are quoted as observed limits, while median values of the limits from a large number of pseudoexperiments, where only SM background is present, are quoted as the expected limits. The upper limits on the \u03c3 B in a Z model are interpreted as lower limits on the Z pole mass using the relationship between the pole mass and the theoretical Z cross-section.",
