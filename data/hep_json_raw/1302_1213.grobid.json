J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 decay mode is performed using 1:0 fb \u00c01 of data collected by the LHCb experiment in 7 TeV center-of-mass energy pp collisions produced by the LHC. A modified Dalitz plot analysis of the final state is performed using both the invariant mass spectra and the decay angular distributions. Resonant structures are observed in the K \u00fe K \u00c0 mass spectrum as well as a significant nonresonant S-wave contribution over the entire K \u00fe K \u00c0 mass range. The largest resonant component is the \u00f01020\u00de, accompanied by f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de, and four additional resonances. The overall branching fraction is measured to be B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f07:70 AE 0:08 AE 0:39 AE 0:60\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third due to the ratio of the number of B 0 s to B \u00c0 mesons produced. The mass and width of the f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de are measured to be 1522:2 AE 2:8 \u00fe5:3 \u00c02:0 MeV and 84 AE 6 \u00fe10 \u00c05 MeV, respectively. The final state fractions of the other resonant states are also reported.",

This study has been reported for the B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 channel [8]. Here we perform a similar analysis for B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 . While a large \u00f01020\u00de contribution is well-known [9] and the f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de component has been recently observed [10] and confirmed [11], other components have not heretofore been identified including the sources of S-wave contributions [12]. The tree-level Feynman diagram for the process is shown in Fig. 1.",

The detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. Components include a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum 2 resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV. The impact parameter (IP) is defined as the minimum distance of approach of the track with respect to the primary vertex. For tracks with large transverse momentum with respect to the proton beam direction, the IP resolution is approximately 20 m. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

This includes both signal and background, with 94% signal purity. We begin our analysis considering only the resonance components \u00f01020\u00de, f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de and a nonresonant component, established in our earlier measurement [10], and add resonances until no others are found with more than two standard deviation statistical significance (2).

Our best fit model includes a nonresonant component and eight resonance states: is not confirmed yet [9], the right shoulder of f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de fits better when we add this state. The presence of multiple broad overlapping resonances in this region may indicate a failure of the isobar model used in this analysis, but with the present data sample alternative descriptions are not feasible. Indeed, the situation is not clear for the resonance states in the vicinity of 1750 MeV. The PDG lists a spin-0 resonance, f 0 \u00f01710\u00de, around 1.72 GeV of K \u00fe K \u00c0 invariant mass [9].

If we substitute either the f 0 \u00f01710\u00de or f 0 \u00f01750\u00de resonance the fit is worsened, as the \u00c0 ln L increase by 59 and 7 units, respectively.",

The f 0 \u00f0980\u00de fraction is smaller in the BABAR parametrization, while the total S-wave fraction is consistent in the three different parameterizations.

In general the interpretation of these moments is that hY 0 0 i is the efficiency-corrected and background-subtracted event distribution, hY 0 1 i the sum of the interference between S-wave and P-wave, and P-wave and D-wave amplitudes, hY 0 2 i the sum of P-wave, D-wave and the interference of S-wave and D-wave amplitudes, hY 0 3 i the interference between P-wave and D-wave amplitudes, and hY 0 4 i the D-wave. As discussed in Sec. VA, the average of B 0 s and B 0 s cancels the interference terms that involve P 0 and D AE . This causes the angular moments hY 0 1 i and hY 0 3 i to be zero when averaging over B 0 s and B 0 s decays. We observe that the fit results well describe the moment distributions, except for the hY 0 1 i and hY 0 4 i values below 1.2 GeV.

The uncertainties due to the background parametrization are estimated by comparing the results from the best fit model with those when the background shape parameters are obtained from a fit to the lower sideband region only. The uncertainties in the efficiency are estimated by comparing the fit results when the efficiency parameters are changed by their statistical uncertainties and are added in quadrature. The effect on the fit fractions of changing the efficiency function is evaluated using a similar method to that used previously [8]. Briefly, we change the efficiency model by increasing the minimum IP 2 requirement from 9 to 12.5 on both of the kaon candidates. This has the effect of increasing the 2 of the fit to the angular distributions of B 0 s ! J=c data by 1 unit. The new efficiency function is then applied to the data with the original minimum IP 2 selection of 9, the likelihood is reevaluated and the uncertainties are estimated by comparing the results with the best fit model. The largest variations among these two efficiency categories are included in the uncertainty. We estimate additional uncertainties by comparing the results when one more resonance is added to the best fit model. The uncertainties due to the line shape of the contributing resonances with fixed mass and width parameters are estimated by varying them individually in the fit according to their combined statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. We compare the results with the best fit and add them in quadrature to estimate the uncertainties due to the line shape.",

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 87, 072004 (2013) where the branching fractions B\u00f0\u00f01020\u00de !

Here the first uncertainty in each case is statistical, the second is systematic and the third reflects the uncertainty due to f s =f d . Note that these are the time-integrated branching fractions. Results on the polarization fractions of B 0 s ! J=c \u00f01020\u00de from a time-dependent analysis will be forthcoming in a separate publication [38]. The ratio of B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de\u00de= B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c \u00f01020\u00de\u00de is consistent with our previous result [10], D0 [11], and the Belle result [39]. The current PDG value of B\u00f0B 0 s !J=c \u00f01020\u00de\u00de\u00bc\u00f01:4AE0:5\u00de\u00c210 \u00c03 is dominated by the CDF measurement [40]. Our measured value is in good agreement with this measurement and also the most recent yet unpublished values measured by CDF [41] and Belle [39]. The Belle collaboration has also recently reported the branching fraction of B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 \u00de [39], where B 0 s ! J=c \u00f01020\u00de is excluded.",

            "text": "The systematic uncertainty on the branching fraction has several contributions listed in Table IX. Since the branching fractions are measured with respect to B \u00c0 ! J=c K \u00c0 which has a different number of charged tracks than the decays of interest, a 1% systematic uncertainty is assigned due to differences in the tracking performance between data and simulation. Another 2% uncertainty is assigned for the additional kaon which is due to decay in flight, large multiple scatterings and hadronic interactions along the track. Using the PDG value for the B 0 s lifetime [9] as input gives rise to an additional 1.5% systematic uncertainty. Small uncertainties are introduced if the simulation does not have the correct B meson kinematic distributions. We are relatively insensitive to any of these differences in the B meson p and p T distributions since we are measuring the relative rates. By varying the p and p T distributions we see at most a change of 0.5%. There is a 1% systematic uncertainty assigned for the relative particle identification efficiencies. An uncertainty of 0.02% is included due to the change of the efficiency function Eq. (20). Three additional uncertainties are considered in the branching fractions of B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c \u00f01020\u00de\u00de and B\u00f0B 0 s ! J=c f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de\u00de as these are measured from the fit fractions of the Dalitz plot analysis. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained by adding each source of systematic uncertainty in quadrature as they are uncorrelated.",
