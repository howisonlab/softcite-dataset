In simulation, the dominant such process is e + e \u2212 \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , in which an energetic photon from one of the \u03c0 0 decays is erroneously taken as the ISR photon. These events have kinematic properties similar to signal events and yield a \u03c7 2 distribution peaked at low values. This component can be evaluated from the data, since such events produce a peak at the \u03c0 0 invariant mass when the photon erroneously identified as the ISR photon is combined with another photon in the event. Following the procedure described in Ref. [10], we use the MC mass distribution, and normalize it to the data in the region 2 < m < 4 GeV, where the \u03c0 0 peak is prominent. A consistent normalization factor is obtained from the 4-6 GeV/c 2 region. For lower masses, we see no significant \u03c0 0 peak in the data, and we use the very small MC prediction with the same normalization.

The NR function must describe a distribution complicated by resonances in, and kinematic constraints on, the other particles in the event, and the widths and positions of the \u03c1(770) and K * (890) resonances do not allow strong constraints from the data. We adopt a simple, conservative procedure, based on the largest sources of variation. We repeat each fit with the NR function reduced to a fourth-order polynomial, and, separately, with the parameters of each resonance under study allowed to vary. The two resulting differences in yield are added in quadrature. To this we add, linearly, a 10% relative uncertainty to account for possible interference between resonances, the use of fixed vs. energydependent widths, and the choice of parametrization for the \u03c1 \u00b1 lineshape. This procedure is applied to the E c.m.integrated distributions in Figs. 8, 10, and 11(a), yielding systematic uncertainties in the respective total yields. In each case, the same relative uncertainty is applied as an overall normalization uncertainty in the cross sections ( Figs. 9 and 11(b)).",

There are also signals for the production of at least one K * (1430) state, and at least three K 1 states. Together, these channels dominate K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 production, and the K * (892) + K * (892) \u2212 channel dominates both K * (892) \u00b1 K 0 S \u03c0 \u2213 and K * (892) \u00b1 K \u2213 \u03c0 0 production.
