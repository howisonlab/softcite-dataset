Intermittency analysis is performed in the midrapidity region in two-dimensional (\u03b7, \u03d5) phase space within the narrow transverse momentum (p T ) bins in the low p T region (p T \u2264 1:0 GeV/c). Power-law scaling of the normalized factorial moments with the number of bins is not observed to be significant in any of the p T bins. Scaling exponent \u03bd, deduced for a few p T bins, is greater than that of the value 1.304, predicted for the second-order phase transition by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The link in the notions of fractality is also studied. Generalized fractal dimensions, D q , are observed to decrease with the order of the moment q suggesting the multifractal nature of the particle generation in EPOS3.",

This array of particles carry signals of QGP and its properties which can be directly and indirectly measured by detectors that are encircling the collision point. Of the myriad of analysis tools to understand the dynamics of this particle production [1] and phase changes in the matter while passing into the QGP phase from the hadronic phase and vice versa, an important one is the fluctuations study of the observables. Lattice QCD predicts large fluctuations being associated with the system undergoing phase transition. Multiplicity distributions characterize the system formed or any phase transition in the heavy-ion collisions. Studies of multiplicity fluctuations have prompted considerable advances in this area of research. Large particle density fluctuations in the JACEE event [2] and its explanation by normalized factorial moments triggered investigations of multiplicity fluctuation patterns in multihadronic events with decreasing domains of phase space [3]. The presence of power-law behaviour or scale invariance of normalized factorial moments with decreasing phase space interval or increasing bins is termed as intermittency [4,5]. Observation of intermittency signals the presence of self-similar and fractal nature of the particle production. If fluctuations have a dynamical origin, the underlying probability density will be reflected as intermittency behaviour. The existence of dynamical fluctuations can thus be studied using normalized factorial moments (NFMs) [4] in one-, two-, or three-dimensional phase space.",

There, it signifies as a property of turbulent fluid: vortices of fluid with different size alternate in such a way that they form self-similar structures. These vortices do not necessarily fill in the entire volume, but they instead create an intermittent pattern in the regions of laminar flow. This property is given by a power-law variation of the vortex-distribution moments on their size. So, the selfsimilar nature of vortices directly creates a relation between intermittency and fractality. Self-similar objects of nonintegral dimensions are called fractals [6]. A fractal dimension is a generalization of an ordinary topological dimensionality to nonintegers.",

            "text": "The proposal to look for intermittency also prompts a thorough study of phase-transition models. A very straightforward model that offers some hint on the nature of a second-order phase transition is the Ising model in two dimensions [7]. Intermittency in Ising model has been studied both analytically and numerically [8,9], and the anomalous fractal dimension (d q ) is found to be 1/8, independent of the order of moment, q. It has been conjectured on this acount that intermittency may be monofractal in QCD second-order phase transition [10]. However, all types of interactions including heavy-ion collisions show multifractal behaviour [3,11]. Also, Yang-Mills fields have been applied to QCD within asymptotic approximation where the fractal dimension is determined as a function of entropic index, and value obtained for entropic index is in good agreement with the experimental data [12]. For the firstorder phase transition, all d q are zero, and no intermittency was observed. Intermittency has also been studied in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, which has been accustomed to explain the confinement of magnetic fields into fluxoids in a type-II superconductor. From the study of normalized factorial moments with decreasing phase space bins for the Ginzburg-Landau second-order formalism, the anomalous fractal dimension is observed not to be constant. It follows d q /d 2 = \u00f0q \u2212 1\u00de \u00f0\u03bd\u22121\u00de , where \u03bd is the scaling exponent [13]. \u03bd is observed to be a universal quantity valid for all systems describable by the GL theory for the second-order phase transition, and it is independent of the underlying dimensions or the parameters of the model. This is of particular importance for a QCD phase transition, since neither the transition temperature nor the other important parameters are known there. If a signature of quark-hadron phase transition depends on the details of the heavy-ion collisions, e.g., nuclear sizes, collision energy, and transverse energy, then even after the system has passed the thresholds for the creation of QGP, such a signature is likely to be sensitive to this theory.",

Each pomeron by virtue of its cylindrical topology has two flux tubes. The flux tubes also expand with time and gets fragmented into string segments of quark-antiquark pairs, resulting in more than two flux tubes. The high string density areas form the \"core\" (bulk matter) [16] and the low string density areas form the \"corona.\" The corona particles originate from the string decay by Schwinger mechanism. In EPOS3, only the core region thermalizes, flows, and hadronizes. The core undergoes viscous hydrodynamic evolution and as the hadronisation temperature (T H = 168 MeV) is reached, Cooper-Frye mechanism [18] is applied to convert the fluid into particles. For hadronic cascade, all the hadrons participate from both core and corona. When the cascading mechanism is included in the modeling, EPOS3 might show self-similarity and thus intermittency effect [19]. EPOS3 is universal and unique in the sense that it treats pp, pA, and AA scatterings with the same core-corona procedure.",

The charged particle pseudorapidity density (dN ch /d\u03b7) distributions of these events are shown in Figure 1, for various 2 Advances in High Energy Physics centralities and are compared with that of ATLAS data [20] for the same system and energy. Where for the polar angle \u03b8 of the particle, measured with respect to the beam axis, the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212In tan \u00f0\u03b8/2\u00de. In this work, analysis is performed for the charged particles generated in full azimuthal space with |\u03b7| \u2264 0:8| in the most central events. It is observed (Figure 1) that in the midrapidity region of our interest (|\u03b7| \u2264 0:8), charged particle pseudorapidity density of the EPOS3 generated central (0-10%) events, slightly overestimates the ATLAS data within errors. Intermittency studies at low energies had limitation of statistics because a lesser number of particles were available per bin for the order of the moment q \u2265 2. In the present collider experiments, with the availability of high multiplicity events per pseudorapidity unit both in pp and AA collisions the studies of local multiplicity fluctuations, dependent on the bin contents can be taken up, to get a clear and complete picture of the multiparticle production. Predictions for intermittency analysis of data at present collider energies are still not available. Present work is carried to study scaling behaviours of the charged particles multiplicity fluctuations and hence the intermittency in the EPOS3 model, which is based on the hydrodynamic particle production mechanism.",

Central events with b \u2264 3:5 fm generated from Pb-Pb collisions at ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi s NN p = 2:76 TeV have been studied. The two-dimensional intermittency analysis is performed in (\u03b7, \u03d5) phase space with |\u03b7| \u2264 0:8 and full azimuth space in the narrow transverse momentum (p T ) bins in the region with p T \u2264 1:0 GeV/c with the objective to study the scaling behaviour of the charged particle multiplicity fluctuations as are introduced by the hydro and hydro+cascade modes of the EPOS3 model. In narrow p T bins in the (\u03b7, \u03d5) space, M-scaling is found to be absent     Figure 8: q dependence of fractal dimensions, D q for the EPOS3 (hydro and hydro+cascade) events in the two p T bins in which weak M-scaling and F-scaling, is observed. 6 Advances in High Energy Physics whereas weak M-scaling in two larger p T bins with \u0394p T \u2265 0:6 GeV/c viz, 0:2 \u2264 p T \u2264 0:8 GeV/c, and 0:2 \u2264 p T \u2264 1:0 GeV /c is observed. Absence of power-law of F q with M indicates the absence of intermittency and hence self-similar behaviour in the local multiplicity fluctuations in charged particle generation in the events and hence the EPOS3 model. For the narrow p T bins \u0394p T < 0:6 GeV/c, F-scaling which is independent of the observation of M-scaling is also absent. However, in the wider p T bins 0:2 \u2264 p T \u2264 0:8 GeV/c and 0:2 \u2264 p T \u2264 1:0 GeV/c, F q shows power-law with F 2 . This is in contrast to what is observed in [27], where M-scaling as well as F-scaling is observed in the small p T bins with \u0394p T \u2264 0:2 GeV/c. The average value of \u03bd, the scaling exponent for these two bins from the two modes of EPOS3 is 1.809, a value different from 1.304, the value as obtained from Ginzburg-Landau theory for second-order phase transition. This suggests the absence of spatial fluctuations in the local charged particle generation that was not the case with the transport String Melting AMPT model [27]. In the larger phase space bins corresponding to \u0394p T \u2265 0:6 GeV/c in the low p T region, M-scaling observed for the low M values is reflected in the value of generalized fractal dimension, D q . D q shows an inverse dependence on q for q > 2, thus the presence of multifractality in the larger phase space bins. This is in contrast to the observations at lower energies. Similar studies of experimental data from RHIC and LHC are yet not available. It would be interesting to see whether we get similar observations from the experiment or not.",
