The measurements are performed in the lepton+jets (e/\u03bc+jets) and in the dilepton (e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , and e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) decay channels. The tt cross section is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the charged leptons, the jets associated to b quarks, the top quarks, and the tt system. The data are compared with several predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamic up to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order precision. No significant deviations are observed relative to the standard model predictions.",

            "text": "Understanding the production and properties of top quarks is fundamental for testing the quality of the standard model (SM) and for searching for new physical phenomena beyond its scope. The large top quark data samples produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC provide access to precision measurements that are crucial for checking the internal consistency of the SM at the LHC energy scale. In particular, measurements of the top quark pair (tt) production cross section as a function of tt kinematic observables are important for comparing with the state-of-the-art quantum chromodynamic (QCD) predictions within the SM, and thereby constrain QCD parameters. In addition, the top quark plays a relevant role in theories beyond the SM, and such differential measurements are therefore expected to be sensitive to new phenomena [1].",

We present here the first measurement of the normalized differential tt production cross section with the CMS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The analysis uses data recorded in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 , which is about a factor of four larger than the sample used in the measurement performed by the CMS Collaboration at 7 TeV [5]. The analysis largely follows the procedures of Ref. [5] and benefits from the increase in statistical precision together with improvements in kinematic reconstruction algorithms and extended systematic studies, leading to a significant reduction of the total uncertainties.",

Within the field volume are a silicon-pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Charged particle trajectories are measured by the inner tracking system, covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL and the HCAL surround the tracking volume, providing highresolution energy and direction measurements of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets up to |\u03b7| < 3. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux return yoke outside the solenoid covering the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| < 5.2. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam directions. A two-tier trigger system selects the pp collisions for use in the analysis. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [18].",

While powheg and mc@nlo are formally equivalent up to the NLO accuracy, they differ in the techniques used to avoid double counting of radiative corrections that can arise from interfacing with the parton showering generators. Two powheg samples are used: one is processed through pythia6 and the other through herwig (v. 6.520, referred to as herwig6 in the following) for the subsequent parton showering and hadronization. The parton showering in pythia6 is based on a transverse-momentum-ordered evolution scale, whereas in herwig6 it is angular-ordered. The events generated with mc@nlo are interfaced with herwig6. The herwig6 AUET2 tune [23] is used to model the underlying event in the powheg+herwig6 sample, while the default tune is used in the mc@nlo+herwig6 sample. The proton structure is described by the PDF sets CT10 [24] and CTEQ6M [20] for powheg and mc@nlo, respectively.

The data are reasonably well described by the simulation, as shown in the lower part of each plot, where the ratio of data to simulation is presented to better indicate the level of agreement between data and the default tt signal (MadGraph+pythia6) and background samples used in the analysis. For both channels, however, data tend to have lower p T values than predicted by the simulation. It has been verified that the results presented in Sect. 6 are not affected by these remaining differences between data and simulation. A better data-to-simulation agreement in the lepton and jet p T distributions is obtained by scaling the top quark p T spectrum in simulation to match the data.

The fit is constrained to reconstruct two W bosons, each with a mass of 80.4 GeV. In addition, the reconstructed top quark and antiquark masses are required to be equal. To reduce the number of permutations in the association of jets to quarks, only btagged jets are considered as b quarks, and only untagged jets are considered as light quarks. In events with several combinatorial solutions, only the one with the minimum \u03c7 2 in the fit is accepted. The main improvement relative to the method described in Ref. [5] is the increase in the number of correct assignments of b jets to b quarks. This is achieved by applying the kinematic fit twice, sequentially, in each event. In the first fit, the top quark mass is fixed to a value of 172.5 GeV. The jet combination that provides the minimum \u03c7 2 in the fit is then used as input to the second kinematic fit, in which the top quark mass is not fixed, and the solution to this fit is retained. A further improvement in the method is to require the \u03c7 2 -probability of the second kinematic fit to be >2 %. This criterion is chosen to optimize the fraction of correctly reconstructed signal events, without increasing significantly the statistical uncertainty in the data. The efficiency of this requirement is about 87 % for signal events with the correct jet assignment. As a result, the number of correctly reconstructed events is increased by almost a factor of two relative to the method used in Ref. [5], and effects from migration of events across bins, which are relevant for the measurements of the cross section, are reduced. It has been checked that any possible bias in the results that could be introduced by fixing the top quark mass to a specific value in the first kinematic fit is within the assigned systematic uncertainty on the dependence of the measurement on the top quark mass (cf. Sect. 5.2).",

The only unknowns are the threemomenta of the two neutrinos, which are reconstructed imposing the following kinematic constraints: p T conservation in the event; the W bosons, and top quark and antiquark masses. In contrast to the method of Ref. [5], the top quark mass is fixed to a value of 172.5 GeV. Each suitable pair of b jet candidates in the event, and both possible assignments of these two jets to the two selected leptons, are considered in the kinematic reconstruction. Combinations with two btagged jets are preferred to using single b-tagged jets. In the new method, events are reconstructed 100 times, each time randomly smearing the measured energies and directions of the reconstructed lepton and b jet candidates by their respective detector resolutions. This smearing recovers events that yielded no solution of the equations for the neutrino momenta, because of measurement fluctuations. The equations for the neutrino momenta can have up to four solutions. For a given smearing, the solution is identified by the one yielding the smallest invariant mass of the tt system. For each solution, a weight is calculated based on the expected true lepton-b-jet invariant mass spectrum. The weights are summed over the 100 reconstruction attempts, and the kinematic quantities associated to the top quark and antiquark are calculated as a weighted average. Finally, the two jet and lepton-jet assignments that yield the maximum sum of weights are chosen for analysis. It has been checked that any bias introduced through the use of the lepton-b-jet and tt invariant masses is negligible. This method yields on average a reconstruction efficiency of \u224894 %, which is 6 % higher than the one described in Ref. [5], and reduces systematic migration effects.",

This is achieved by dividing the b jet distributions in p T and \u03b7 into two bins at the median of the respective distributions. These correspond to p T = 65 GeV, and |\u03b7| = 0.7 and 0.75 for the +jets and dilepton channels, respectively. The btagging scale factors for b jets in the first bin are scaled up by half of the uncertainties quoted in Ref. [40], while those in the second bin are scaled down, and vice versa, so that a maximum variation is assumed and the difference between the scale factors in the two bins reflects the full uncertainty  The uncertainty in background normalization is determined by changing the background yields. In the +jets channels, the background normalization for the diboson, QCD multijet, W+jets, and Z+jets samples is conservatively varied by \u00b150 % [5], since these backgrounds, being very small, are determined from simulation rather than from data. The normalization of the tt+Z/W/\u03b3 samples is changed by \u00b130 %. For the single top quark sample, the uncertainty is covered by changing the normalization by \u00b130 %, and the kinematic scales of the event process (renormalization and factorization scales) as described in Sect. 5.2. In the e + e \u2212 and \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channels, the dominant background from Z+jets determined from data [5,43] is changed in normalization by \u00b130 %. In addition, changes in the background contributions from single top quark, diboson, QCD multijet, tt+Z/W/\u03b3 , and W+jets events of \u00b130 % are used in dilepton channels [5].",

In MadGraph, Q is defined by Q 2 = m 2 t + p 2 T , where the sum is over all additional final state partons in the matrix element. The impact of the choice of the scale that separates the description of jet production through matrix elements (ME) or parton shower (PS) in MadGraph is studied by changing its reference value of 20 GeV to 40 and 10 GeV. In the +jets channels, changes in the renormalization and factorization scales are also applied to single top quark events to deter-  , mc@nlo+herwig6, and to NLO+NNLL [14,15] calculations, when available. The lower part of each plot shows the ratio of the predictions to data mine an uncertainty on the shape of this background contribution. The dependence of the measurement on the top quark mass is also estimated from dedicated MadGraph simulation samples in which the top quark mass is changed by \u00b11 GeV relative to the value used in the default simulation. The uncertainty from hadronization and parton showering is assessed by comparing the results obtained from samples simulated with powheg and mc@nlo interfaced with pythia6 and herwig6, respectively. The uncertainty from the choice of PDF is determined by reweighting the sample of simulated tt signal events according to the 52 CT10 PDF error sets [24], at a 90 % confidence level. The maximum variation is taken as uncertainty. As mentioned in Sects. 4.2 and 4.3, the effect of scaling the top quark p T spectrum in simulation to match the data has negligible impact on the measured cross sections, therefore no systematic uncertainty is taken into account for this effect.   The normalized tt cross section in each bin i of each observable X is determined as a function of the kinematic properties of the leptons, the lepton pair, the b jets, the b jet system, the top quarks, and the tt system through the relation [5]:",

The generalized inverse of the response matrix is used to obtain the unfolded distribution from the measured distribution by applying a \u03c7 2 minimization technique. A smoothing prescription (regularization) is applied to prevent large unphysical fluctuations that can be introduced when directly inverting the response matrix. The strength of the regularization is determined and optimized individually for each distribution using the averaged global correlation method [50]. To keep the bin-to-bin migrations small, the widths of bins in the measurement are chosen according to their purity (ratio of the number of events generated and reconstructed in a particular bin to the total number of events reconstructed in that bin; this quantity is sensitive to migrations into the bin) and stability (ratio of the number of events generated and reconstructed in a particular bin to the number of events generated in that bin; this is sensitive to migrations out of the bin).

The distributions of the transverse momentum of the b jets p b T and their pseudorapidity \u03b7 b are given in Fig. 6, together with the transverse momentum p bb T and invariant mass m bb of the b jet pair. Also shown are predictions from Mad-Graph+pythia6, powheg+pythia6, powheg+herwig6, and mc@nlo+herwig6. The lower panel in each plot shows the ratio of each of these predictions to data, in order to quantify their level of agreement relative to data.   In general, none of the examined predictions provides an accurate description of data for all measured lepton and b jet distributions. A steeper p T spectrum is observed in data for the lepton and the b jet distributions compared to the predictions in both decay channels, which is best described by powheg+herwig6. The lepton p T in data is above the predictions for p T < 40 GeV, while it is below for p T > 100 GeV. A similar behaviour is observed for p",

            "text": "In general, the powheg+herwig6 prediction provides a good description of data for all measured distributions. The shape of the top quark p T spectrum is softer in data than in the predictions from MadGraph+pythia6, powheg+pythia6, and mc@nlo+herwig6 in both channels. The data lie above the predictions for p t T < 60 (65) GeV in the +jets (dilepton) channels, while they lie below for p t T > 200 GeV. This effect was also observed at 7 TeV [5]. The disagreement between data and predictions in the tail of the distributions is also observed in a measurement by the ATLAS Collaboration [6]. In contrast, the prediction from powheg+herwig6 and the approximate NNLO calculation provide a better description of the data, as they predict a slightly softer top quark p T distribution than the three other simulations. The difference between the powheg+pythia6 and powheg+herwig6 distributions is attributed to different treatment of the hardest initial state radiation in pythia6 and herwig6. The same pattern is observed for p t * T , indicating that the softer spectrum in data is not caused by the boost of the tt system. It is also present in the p t1 T , and particularly, in the p t2 T distributions. For all these distributions, the powheg+herwig6 prediction provides a better description of the data. The difference in the shape of the top quark p T spectrum between data and simulation is  observed consistently in the analyses using different event selection requirements or different pileup conditions. The y t distribution is found to be slightly less central in data than in the predictions, particularly in the case of Mad-Graph+pythia6 and the approximate NNLO calculation, which are more central than the other predictions. On the contrary, y tt is more central in data, and it is slightly better described by MadGraph+pythia6. The m tt distribution in data tends to be lower than the predictions for large m tt values, and is better described by MadGraph+pythia6 and powheg+herwig6. The p tt T spectrum is well described by all the considered predictions, except for the NLO+NNLL calculation, which fails to describe the data for all p tt T values. The results from the +jets and dilepton channels are compared to each other in Figs. 15, 16 and 17. This is only feasible for the top quark and tt quantities, since they are measured in the same phase space (i.e. the full parton level phase space) for both channels. The results are presented relative to the MadGraph+pythia6 prediction to highlight the level of agreement between data and the default tt simulation. To facilitate the comparison of measurements that are performed using different size and number of bins, a horizontal bin-centre correction is applied to all data points from both channels. In each bin, the measured data points are presented at the horizontal position in the bin where the predicted bin-averaged cross section equals the cross section of the unbinned MadGraph+pythia6 calculation (cf. [51]), which is common for both channels. The data are also compared to the predictions from powheg+pythia6, powheg+herwig6, mc@nlo+herwig6 relative to Mad-Graph+pythia6. The results are consistent between the channels for all quantities, in particular, for all measurements related to the top quark p T distribution. The softer spectrum in data relative to MadGraph+pythia6 is clearly visible.",

The measurements are performed with the CMS detector in the +jets ( = e or \u03bc) and dilepton (e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , and e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) tt decay channels. The normalized tt cross section is measured as a function of the transverse momentum, rapidity, and invariant mass of the final-state leptons and b jets in the fiducial phase space, and the top quarks and tt system in the full phase space. The measurements in the different decay channels are in agreement with each other. In general, the data are in agreement with standard model predictions up to approximate NNLO precision. Among the examined predictions, powheg+herwig6 provides the best overall description of the data. However, the p T spectrum in data for leptons, jets, and top quarks is softer than expected, particularly for MadGraph+pythia6, powheg+pythia6, and mc@nlo+herwig6. The calculation at approximate NNLO precision also provides a good description of the top quark p T spectrum. The m tt distribution in data tends to be lower than the predictions for large m tt values. The p tt T spectrum is well described by all the considered predictions, except for the NLO+NNLL calculation, which fails to describe the data for all p tt T values. The results show the same behaviour as the corresponding CMS measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV.
