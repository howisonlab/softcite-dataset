Quantitative predictions of CP asymmetries are difficult, since the computation of stronginteraction effects in the non-perturbative regime is involved. In spite of this, it was commonly assumed that the observation of asymmetries of the order of 1% in charm decays would be an indication of new sources of CP violation (CPV). Recent studies, however, suggest that CP asymmetries of this magnitude could still be accommodated within the SM [1][2][3][4].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum, p T . Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors [15]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [16]. The trigger [17] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have muons with high transverse momentum or hadrons, photons or electrons with high transverse energy deposit in the calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.  The solid (blue) line is the fit function, the (green) dashed line is the signal component and the (magenta) dotted line is the background. with good quality, each not pointing to any PV, and with requirements on p T , momentum p, scalar sum of p T of the tracks, and a significant displacement from any PV.",

Since the selection criteria suppress charm background decays to a negligible level, it is assumed that the background contribution to the signal is similar to the sidebands.

The region P1-P3 definitions are the same. The results for the raw asymmetry are shown in Fig. 12. The production asymmetry is clearly visible in all the regions with the same magnitude as in the control channel (see Fig. 6). It is accounted for in the kNN method as a deviation of the measured value of \u03bc T from the ref-erence value \u03bc TR shown in Fig. 12. In the signal sample the values \u03bc T \u2212 0.5 = (98 \u00b1 15) \u00d7 10 \u22127 and (\u03bc T \u2212 \u03bc TR )/ (\u03bc T \u2212 \u03bc TR ) = 6.5\u03c3 in the full Dalitz plot are a consequence of the 0.4% global asymmetry similar to that observed in the control mode and consistent with the previous measurement from LHCb [21].",
