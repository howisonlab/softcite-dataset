            "text": "Although there are alternative explanations for some of these anomalies, they could be all explained with the existence of a dark matter weakly interacting massive particle, WIMP, belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the Standard Model (SM) particles are uncharged [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. An abelian gauge field, the U boson with mass near the GeV scale, couples the secluded sector to the SM through its kinetic mixing with the SM hyper-charge gauge field. The kinetic mixing parameter, , is expected to be of the order 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 [11,20], so that observable effects can be induced in O(GeV)-energy e + e \u2212 colliders [21,20,[22][23][24] and fixed target experiments [25][26][27][28]. The possible existence of a new light boson gauging a new symmetry with a small coupling was in fact already introduced on general grounds in [29], and rediscussed in models postulating also the existence of light spin 0 or 1/2 dark matter particles [30,31]. This boson can have both vector and axialvector couplings to quark and leptons, however axial couplings are strongly constrained by data, leaving room to vector couplings only.",

In this work, we study the process \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U , using a sample of \u03c6 mesons produced resonantly at the DA NE collider. The U boson can be observed by its decay into a lepton pair, while the \u03b7 can be tagged by one of its main decays. An irreducible background due to the Dalitz decay of the \u03c6 meson, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 + \u2212 , is present. This decay has been studied by the SND and CMD-2 experiments, which measured a branching fraction of BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 ) = (1.19 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 ) = (1.14 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively [32,33]. This corresponds to a cross section of \u03c3 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 + \u2212 ) \u223c 0.7 nb, with a di-lepton mass range M < 470 MeV.

This sample has been used to evaluate the resolution on the e + e \u2212 invariant mass as a function of M U , applying a Gaussian fit to the M ee \u2212 M U distributions. Results are reported in Fig. 6. The resolution is \u223c 2 MeV for M U < 350 MeV and then improves to 1 MeV for higher values. The upper limit on \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U signal as a function of M U is then obtained in the following way: (a) MC events are divided in sub-samples of 1 MeV width in the range 5 < M U < 470 MeV; (b) for each M U sub-sample, the average value of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 background, b(M ee ), is obtained by fitting the reconstructed M ee spectrum with 5 MeV binning, removing five bins centered at M U ; (c) for each fit, the maximum variation of b(M ee ) events, b(M ee ), is obtained changing by \u00b11\u03c3 the fit parameters; (d) for each M U value, the signal hypothesis is tested comparing observed data, b(M ee ) and MC signal in the five reconstructed bins excluded in (b). The exclusion plot is obtained applying the CLs method [39]. A Gaussian spread of width b(M ee ) on the background distribution is applied while evaluating CLs.",
