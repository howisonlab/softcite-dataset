A clear structure is observed in the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum around 1.02 GeV/c 2 , which can be attributed to interference between J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays. Due to this interference, two possible solutions are found. The corresponding measured values of the branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 are [2.94 \u00b1 0.16(stat.) \u00b1 0.16(syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22126 and [1.24 \u00b1 0.33(stat.) \u00b1 0.30(syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22127 .",

            "text": "The discovery of the J/\u03c8 played an important role in understanding the basic constituents of nature and opened a new era in particle physics. Its unexpected narrow decay width provided insight into the study of strong interactions. As its mass is below the charmed meson pair threshold, direct decay into charmed mesons is forbidden. Therefore the J/\u03c8 hadronic decay modes are Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) [1] suppressed, and the final states are composed only of light hadrons.",

However the presence of doubly OZI (DOZI) suppressed processes, like the observation of J/\u03c8 radiatively decaying into \u03c9\u03c6 [5,6], complicates matters as they do not obey quark correlation or satisfy nonet symmetry (treating SU(3) octets and singlet as a nonet and assuming the coupling constants are the same in the interactions [2,3]). Well established phenomenological models [2,3] have indicated that the DOZI amplitude can have a large impact through interference with the singly OZI suppressed amplitude.",

From MC simulations, the ratio between the number of this background events and the number of the coherent background events in the \u03c0 0 mass region is 0.5%. As little is known about the possible intermediate states, we neglect this background and consider the related systematic uncertainty. 3The non-\u03c6 and non-\u03c0 0 background are dominated by the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K + K \u2212 , \u03b3\u03c0 0 K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 K + K \u2212 with various intermediate states. MC simulations show they can be subtracted by the \u03c0 0 mass sideband events. All background types are summarized in Table I. Through the studies above, none of these background events produce a structure in the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum. In addition, the detection efficiency as a function of M (K + K \u2212 ), obtained from the MC simulation and taking into account the angular distributions [19], is also smooth over the K + K \u2212 mass region, with no structure in the region of the \u03c6 signal. A possible explanation for the structure in the M (K + K \u2212 ) spectrum is interference between J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 and other processes with the same final state. We have verified this using a statistical hypothesis test [20,21]. In the null hypothesis without J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 , a secondorder polynomial function, defined as F H0 = P (m) \u2261 c 0 + c 1 m + c 2 m 2 , is used in the fit to describe the data after subtraction of the \u03c0 0 -sideband events. The positive hypothesis is characterized by a two-component function (F H1 ), in which the model is a coherent sum of a relativistic Breit-Wigner resonance and the second-order polynomial function, convoluted with a Gaussian function G(m, \u03c3 m ) to take into account the mass resolution, \u03c3 m .",

Two solutions with two different phase angles between the \u03c6 resonance and the non-\u03c6 contributions are found. The final fits, including the individual contributions of each components, are illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 2 (b), while the signal yields and the relative phase angles are summarized in Table II. In Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 2 (b), the blue dashed curve is the non\u03c6 contribution (the first term in Eq. 4); the red dotted curve denotes the \u03c6 resonance (the second term in Eq. 4); the green dot-dashed curve represents their interference (the third term in Eq. 4); and the blue solid curve is the sum of them. The signal yield N sig in Table II is calculated by integrating the function of the \u03c6 resonance over the fit range. The statistical significance is determined by the change of the log likelihood value and the number of degrees of freedom in the fit with and without the \u03c6 signal [20,23]. Both solutions have a statistical significance of 6.4\u03c3, which means that they provide identically good descriptions of data. The non-resonant quantum electrodynamics (QED) contribution is estimated in two ways. One way is by analyzing data taken at energies far from any resonance, namely at 3.05, 3.06, 3.08, 3.083, 3.090 and 3.65 GeV. The other way is to use data from the \u03c8(3770) resonance, assuming that the possible contribution \u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 is negligible. The selection criteria are the same except for the required 4-momenta in the kinematic fit. Neither sample shows significant \u03c6\u03c0 0 events. With a simultaneous fit, we obtain the QED contribution to the signal yield N con \u03c6\u03c0 0 (3.097) < 5.8 at the 90% C.L., normalized according to the luminosity and efficiency and assuming the cross section is proportional to 1/s with s being the square of the c.m. energy.

It can be interpreted as interference of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 with other processes decaying to the same final state. The fit yields two possible solutions and thus two branching fractions, [2.94 \u00b1 0.16(stat.) \u00b1 0.16(syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22126 and [1.24 \u00b1 0.33(stat.) \u00b1 0.30(syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22127 .
