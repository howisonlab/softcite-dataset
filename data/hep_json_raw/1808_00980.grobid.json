The spin alignment measurements are carried out with respect to production plane and 2 nd order event plane. At low p T the spin density matrix element \u03c1 00 for K * 0 is found to have values slightly below 1/3, while it is consistent with 1/3, i.e. no spin alignment, at high p T . Similar values of \u03c1 00 are observed with respect to both production plane and event plane. Within statistical and systematic uncertainties, \u03c1 00 values are also found to be independent of \u221a s NN . \u03c1 00 also shows centrality dependence with maximum deviation from 1/3 for mid-central collisions with respect to both the kinematic planes. The measurements for K * 0 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV and for K 0 S (a spin 0 hadron) in 20-40% central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are consistent with no spin alignment.",

One of the main goals of the ALICE physics program in heavy-ion collisions is to look for the signatures of these effects. The proposed signature is the measurement of the spin alignment of vector mesons. The spin alignment measurements can be performed by studying the angular distributions of the vector meson decay daughters [3,4,5]. The angular distribution of vector mesons [6] is given by dN d cos",

The quantization axis can be normal to the production plane, that is determined by the momentum of the vector meson and the beam direction. It can also be normal to the reaction plane that is determined by the impact parameter and the beam direction. R is the event plane resolution. In case of the production plane analysis R = 1. \u03c1 00 is the zeroth element of the spin density matrix, which is a 3x3 hermitian matrix with unit trace. Since K * 0 decays via the strong interaction, the diagonal elements \u03c1 11 and \u03c1 \u22121\u22121 are degenerate and the only independent observable is \u03c1 00 . The polarization effects caused by either initial conditions or final state effects would lead to non-uniform angular distributions of vector mesons. This results in a deviation of the \u03c1 00 from 1/3, which indicates a net spin alignment whereas \u03c1 00 = 1/3 signals no spin alignment. Here we present new results related to the spin alignment of K * 0 vector mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV measured as a function of p T and centrality. The spin density matrix element \u03c1 00 is measured w.r.t. the production and event planes using the ALICE detector [7].",

Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector for particle identification at mid-rapidity and the forward detector V0 for triggering and centrality estimation. The V0 detector is also used for the estimation of the 2 nd order event plane having a typical resolution of 0.70 for 10-50% centrality class. The K * 0 vector meson is reconstructed through the invariant mass of its decay daughters from its dominant hadronic decay channel (K * 0 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 ). The major contribution to the background in the invariant mass distributions is combinatorial. It is estimated using the mixed event technique, where opposite charged K and \u03c0 from different events are mixed. These events are required to have similar multiplicity and collision point position. Even after subtracting combinatorial background still a certain amount of residual background remains under the resonance peak that is described by the second-order polynomial in this analysis. The invariant mass distributions of \u03c0K pairs, after combinatorial background subtraction, are shown in Fig. 1 for Pb-Pb collisions. These are the representative plots shown for a particular p T and cos \u03b8 * bin and the same procedure is followed for each p T and cos \u03b8 * bin of the analysis. These distributions are then fitted with a Breit-Wigner function for the signal and a second-order polynomial for the residual background to extract the K * 0 yield in each p T and cos \u03b8 * bin of a particular centrality class. The K * 0 yields are then corrected for the corresponding reconstruc- ",

The \u03c1 00 values of K * 0 are lower than 1/3 at low p T (< 2.0 GeV/c) for both production and event planes. The significance of \u03c1 00 value of K * 0 for 0.4 \u2264 p T < 1.2 GeV/c is about 2.5\u03c3 lower than 1/3 and about 2.3\u03c3 lower than TeV, respectively.
