This feature can be harnessed to detect the differences between the oscillation parameters of neutrinos and antineutrinos independently. In this paper, we analysed Charged Current \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events under the influence of earth matter effect using three neutrino flavor oscillation framework. If the atmospheric mass-squared differences and mixing parameters for neutrinos are different from antineutrinos, we present the prospects for the experimental observation of these differences in atmospheric \u03bd and \u03bd \u00b5 oscillations at INO. We estimate the detector sensitivity to confirm a non-zero difference in the mass-squared splittings (|\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |) for neutrinos and antineutrinos.",

            "text": "where, |\u03bd i represents a neutrino with a definite mass m i (i=1,2,3), |\u03bd \u03b1 represents a neutrino with a definite flavor, and U \u03b1i is the famous Pontecorvo Maki Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) lepton mixing matrix [6,7]. The oscillation probability depends on three mixing angles, \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , \u03b8 23 ; two mass differences, \u2206m 2 21 =m 2 2 \u2212 m 2 1 , and \u2206m 2 31 =m 2 3 \u2212 m 2 1 , and a CP phase \u03b4 CP . Although a remarkable progress has been made by several neutrino experiments to measure these oscillation parameters with reasonable accuracy [8,9,10,11], still there are several physics concerns that perhaps lie beyond paradigm of the three-massive-neutrinos scheme. The particles and their antiparticles are assumed to have equal masses and their different couplings are closely related as a consequence of the CPT-theorem. Therefore, parameters governing neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities are considered to be identical. But, there is a possibility that neutrino and antineutrino may behave differently [12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. The survival probability for muon neutrinos at a particular energy E \u03bd and propagation length L is given by P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 ) 1 \u2212 4 cos 2 \u03b8 13 sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 13 sin 2 \u03b8 23 ] sin 2 ( 1.267|\u2206m 2 32 |L E \u03bd ).",

            "text": "Comparing the oscillation parameters of neutrinos and antineutrinos could, therefore, be a particular test of CPT-conservation or any difference between them may indicate a sign of new physics. Some experiments such as MINOS [19,20,21] and Super-Kamiokande (SK) [22] have performed some analyses with their experimental data assuming non-identical parameters for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and found that neutrino and antineutrinos oscillation parameters are in agreement. Also, the magnetized Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector of the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) [23] can easily distinguish an atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events on an event by event basis with its excellent charge identification capability due presence of a strong magnetic field. A detail of the ICAL detector at the INO is given in Sec. 2. This paper presents the future ICAL sensitivity for the measurement of muon neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters assuming that neutrinos and antineutrinos have different atmospheric mass-squared splittings and mixing angles assuming Normal mass Hierarchy(NH) is true. We study the prospects of the scenario when both the differences (|\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |) and (sin 2 \u03b8 23 -sin 2 \u03b8 23 ) are non-zero. Earlier INO study as in Ref [24] shows the ICAL detector sensitivity to measure the difference (|\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |) when only mass square splittings of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are different with the assumption that \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 mixing angles are identical i.e.(sin 2 \u03b8 23 -sin 2 \u03b8 23 =0). In this paper, with the realistic detector resolutions and efficiencies of the ICAL, we vary all the four atmospheric oscillation parameters (|\u2206m 2 32 |, |\u2206m 2 32 |, sin 2 \u03b8 23 , sin 2 \u03b8 23 ) simultaneously for neutrinos and antineutrinos to get a four dimensional fit. Using the results of this four parameters fit analysis, we show the ICAL detector potential to observe the difference between the neutrino and antineutrino mass-squared splittings (|\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |) and its sensitivity for ruling out the identical oscillation parameter hypothesis.",

An Iron-Calorimeter (ICAL) will be the prime detector at INO to address the current issues in neutrino physics. The aim of the ICAL detector is to observe the neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations separately using \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) disappearance channel with good precision in GeV energy range. The detector is expected to be magnetized to about 1.5 T, allowing differentiation of the events induced by muon neutrinos and muon antineutrinos. Through this sensitivity, one can probe the difference in matter effects in the propagation of neutrinos and antineutrinos traversing through the Earth. This, in turn, will allow for a sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy, which is one of the primary goals of the ICAL experiment. The ICAL detector will consist of three modules, each module will have a dimension of 16 m \u00d7 16 m \u00d7 14.5 m, comprising a total weight of about 50 kton. Each module will be a stack of 150 layers, where 5.6 cm thick iron plates are interleaved with Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of dimension 2m \u00d7 2m having gas thickness of 3 mm. A total of 30000 RPCs [25] are going to be used as active detector element for the INO-ICAL detector.",

Figure 4 shows the ICAL sensitivity for atmospheric mass-squared splitting on |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | parameter space by minimizing over sin 2 \u03b8 23 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 at different confidence intervals.

The diagonal dashed line in Figure 4 indicates the case of identical mass splittings and mixing angles for neutrinos and antineutrinos, respectively. The neutrino mass-squared splittings on the |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | parameter space at different confidence intervals obtained from MINOS detector using both beamline and atmospheric data has been shown in Figure 4 of Ref.

Figure 5 shows the sample sensitivity plots for different combinations of oscillation parameters as shown in Table 4 as a function of (\u03b4 m ) and (\u03b4 \u03b8 ) at different Confidence Levels (C.L.). In these plots, the origin point shows the null hypothesis where neutrino and antineutrino parameters could be identical or in other words (\u03b4 m = \u03b4 \u03b8 = 0). It can be seen from these figures that as \u03b4 m and \u03b4 \u03b8 move away from the origin point either in the positive or negative direction (as shown in Table 4), the ICAL sensitivity to the null hypothesis varies significantly. For example, Figure 5 shows the same at 2\u03c3 (90%) and more than 2\u03c3 level. Hence, to estimate the real significance of the ICAL detector for ruling out the null hypothesis or to reveal any mismatch in the \u03bd and \u03bd parameters, it is pertinent to vary the true values of all four oscillation fit parameters rather than fixing them at any certain value, as is done in the next section.

It is shown that to get the accurate sensitivity of the ICAL detector and to test the hypothesis that neutrinos and antineutrinos share the identical parameters, the difference between oscillation parameters can not be ignored. Therefore, we allow the possibility of different true values of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 parameters (|\u2206m 2 32 |, sin 2 \u03b8 23 , |\u2206m 2 32 |, sin 2 \u03b8 23 ) in nature. With four parameters fitting analyses, using fixed but different true values of four oscillation parameters, we have shown the ICAL sensitivity for the measurement of the differences |\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |. Further, the extraction of two parameter plots from four parameters fit provides sensitivity for individual oscillation parameters. It has been found that ICAL can measure |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | with a precision of about \u223c 10% and \u223c 13% at 90% Confidence Levels, respectively. Qualitatively, we found that the ICAL is slighltly better sensitive for the antineutrinos mass-squared splittings compared to the MINOS as presented in Ref. [21], by using the atmospheric events only while for the neutrinos masssquared splitting, its sensitivity is almost similar to that of MINOS.",

A minimum \u03c7 2 has been binned as a function of difference in the true values of [\u03b4 m ] T rue keeping marginalization over [sin 2 \u03b8 23 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 ] T rue . This results in several \u03c7 2 points corresponding to a common set of differences of mass-squared splittings. For each set of difference [\u03b4 m ] T rue and , we calculate \u2206\u03c7 2 = \u03c7 2 \u2212 \u03c7 2 min and plot it as the functions of set of differences.
