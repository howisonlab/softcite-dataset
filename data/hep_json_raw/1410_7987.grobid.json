RENO is the first reactor experiment taking data with two identical detectors in different locations (Near and Far), which is critical to reduce systematic uncertainty in reactor neutrino flux. Our data taking has been almost continuous since Aug. 2011 and we have collected about 434,000 (54,000) electron anti-neutrinos in the Near (Far) detector by 2013. Using this data (about 800 live days) we present a new result on \u03b8 13 : sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.101 \u00b1 0.008 (stat.) \u00b1 0.010 (syst.). We also report the 5 MeV excess present in the prompt signal spectrum in our data, and its correlation with our reactor thermal power.",

            "text": "To measure the small mixing angle it is important to precisely measure the small deficit of neutrinos at the distance where the maximum deficit is expected, between 1 and 2 km. However, our current knowledge of absolute reactor neutrino flux is not precise enough (5 % uncertainty [4]) to determine the small deviation from the expected flux caused by oscillations. To achieve this we need two identical detectors: one in near and the other in far site. Using neutrinos observed in the near detector site one can precisely predict the flux of neutrinos at the far site as the distance to the far site is very accurately measured. The RENO collaboration built two almost identical detectors and has taken data continuously since August 2011 using the two detectors.",

This immediate photon signal is called a prompt signal (or s1).

Fast neutrons were estimated in an IBD signal search process with s1 energy spectrum extended up to 45~50 MeV. Above 18 MeV the s1 spectrum caused by fast neutrons appears flat and thus a fitting with a flat function was performed in [18~22, 45~47] MeV regions to estimate fast neutron background in the signal region where the same flat spectrum is assumed. The estimated fast neutron background rate in [0.75, 8] MeV signal region is 2.09 \u00b1 0.06 /day (0.44 \u00b1 0.02 /day) for the Near (Far) detector. The systematic error was obtained using alternative spectral shape, i.e., linear function instead of flat, and take 50 % of the difference. 9 Li and 8 He are unstable isotopes and thus decay by emitting (\u03b2, n) followers. They are produced by atmospheric muons smashing 12 C in liquid scintillator. The (\u03b2, n) followers fake IBD signals. The spectral shape of the 9 Li/ 8 He background was obtained from event time distribution since last muon (> 1.5 GeV) where IBD and other background components are subtracted. The rate was estimated by \"scaling\" method. The \"scaling\" method estimates 9 Li/ 8 He by obtaining a scale factor above 6.5 MeV between IBD candidates and pure 9 Li/ 8 He sample in our data. This scale factor is used to estimate total 9 Li/ 8 He background in [0.75, 8] MeV signal region by multiplying the scale factor to the pure 9 Li/ 8 He sample in the same energy region. The estimated 9 Li/ 8 He background rate in [0.75, 8] MeV signal region is 8.28 \u00b1 0.66 /day (1.85 \u00b1 0.20 /day) for the Near (Far) detector. 252 Cf background has existed since the end of October (September) 2012 for the Near (Far) detector due to a leakage of tiny fraction of 252 Cf source, which was caused by loose O ring of the source container when taking 252 Cf source data. It was found that the contamination is much less in the Near detector. The 252 Cf background spectral shape and rate was obtained by subtracting all the other three background from IBD candidates for the Far detector. For the Near detector the 252 Cf background spectral shape from the Far detector was used due to low statistics of 252 Cf events in the Near detector. And the rate was estimated by fitting IBD candidates with IBD signal and all background spectral functions by constraining with their own rates (except the 252 Cf background) within their background systematic errors. The estimated 9 Li/ 8 He background rate in [0.75, 8] MeV signal region is 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 /day (1.98 \u00b1 0.27 /day) for the Near (Far) detector.",

After subtracting background described in the previous section the average daily observed IBD rates become 569.16 \u00b1 0.87 /day and 63.86 \u00b1 0.28 /day for the Near and the Far detectors, respectively, for the period of data we used in this analysis. Figure 3 shows IBD prompt signal (solid line histogram) and backgrounds (hatched histograms) for the Near (left) and the Far (right) detectors. The inset plots are log-scale of the main plots to show better the small amount of backgrounds. The total background fraction is 3.1 % (8.1 %) for the Near (Far) detector. In Figure 4 our daily observed and expected (with and without oscillation) IBD rates for each day of data taking are shown.  ",
