Offline data analysis then calculates a more precise offline variable for the same quantity, for example the event energy. The efficiency curve is a step function in the online variable, but not in the offline variable. One typically obtains the shape of the efficiency curve in the offline variable by way of a calibration dataset, where the true rate of events at each value of the offline variable is measured once and compared to the rate observed in the physics dataset. For triggers with a fixed threshold condition, it is sometimes possible to obtain the trigger efficiency curve without use of a calibration dataset. This is useful to verify stability of a calibration over time when calibration data cannot be taken often enough. It also makes it possible to use datasets for which no calibration is available. This paper describes the method and the conditions that must be met for it to be applicable.",

The DAQ has only a short time window in which to determine, based on the detector data, the variables on which the trigger condition is based. Hence, the decision about when to trigger must be based on an imperfect estimate of the quantity of interest (such as the event energy), which can be calculated with the required speed [1] and without the use of calibration inputs, which are often only determined after a dataset is recorded.",

The I (x, y) histogram for the simulated events is shown in Fig. 1a. The functional form of the relation between x and y is not typically known a-priori in real data, and the method developed here does not rely on such knowledge, so we limit ourselves in this section to information that can be obtained from the data. This situation will be analysed mathematically in Sect. 3.2. Figure 1a shows what the real detector data might look like. To obtain the trigger turn-on curve in y, the following steps are taken 1. Normalize the I (x, y) histogram such that I (x) = 1 for x \u03b8 x . This can be achieved by dividing each bin (x,y) in the histogram by I (x). We denote the histogram normalized in x as I x (x, y). It is shown in Fig. 1b. After this normalization, I x (x) is equal to the efficiency curve (x) = (x \u2212 \u03b8). 2. Now consider the spectrum in y, that is Fig. 2a. For values of y where all possible values of x are above the trigger threshold (approximately at y 30 in this example), a constant plateau arises. For values of y where some of the possible x values are below the trigger threshold, the spectrum is diminished by that fraction of x values which lies below the threshold. 3. The height of the plateau is determined by a fit with a straight line (red dashed line in Fig. 2a). 4. Finally, I x (y) is divided by the plateau height. The resulting curve, shown in Fig. 2b, is an estimate of the trigger efficiency turn-on function. Because in the simulation the functional dependence is known, the functional shape of the turn-on curve can be fit to the data. This is the blue solid line in Fig. 2a, b.",

Function parameters are taken at the trigger threshold (i.e. this is not a fit). Figure 8 shows the skewed Gaussian example for \u03bc = 0.2y, \u03c3 = 0.015y, and \u03bb = 0.7. The efficiency curve again shows a plateau and the shape is described by Eq. (15), but here the parameters of the turn-on curve were fit out to \u03bc = 19.8, \u03c3 = 2.0, and \u03bb = 0.705, so the parameters that determine the shape differ slightly from the parameters of the skewed Gaussian at the trigger threshold. As previously seen in the Gaussian example, the method fails if \u03bc or \u03c3 are polynomials of order bigger than 1 in y. It also fails if \u03bb is not constant, though if the dependence of \u03bb on x is not strong, an approximately flat plateau region is obtained.",
