            "text": "The measurements of hadron production asymmetries are of primary importance, not only for the understanding of the production mechanisms, but also for enabling precise measurements of CP violation in c and b hadrons at the LHC. Indeed, observed asymmetries must be corrected for production effects to obtain the CP asymmetries in the decays. Simulations that model the nonperturbative fragmentation of b quarks in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies predict asymmetries generally up to a few percent [4,5]. Production asymmetries of B 0 and B 0 s mesons have been measured by LHCb at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, excluding values larger than a few percent [6]. The LHCb collaboration has also searched for possible production asymmetries for D + and D + s mesons, finding the integrated D + production asymmetry differ-ent from zero at approximately three standard deviations [7,8]. In the b-baryon sector, the LHCb collaboration measured the sum of the \u039b 0 b -\u039b 0 b production asymmetry and the CP asymmetry in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 decay [9], finding evidence for a dependence on \u039b 0 b rapidity. This paper reports measurements of the production asymmetries, A P B + , A P B 0 and A P B 0 s , measured using B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decays. In addition, a measurement of A P \u039b 0 b , determined indirectly from the other asymmetries, is presented. Hereafter, K * 0 is used to refer to the K * (892) 0 and the inclusion of charge-conjugate decay modes is implied throughout, except when referring to the production asymmetries, which are defined as",

The measurements are performed as a function of both the component of the momentum transverse to the beam (p T ) and the rapidity ( y) of the hadrons within the LHCb detector acceptance, and are then integrated over the ranges 0 < p T < 30 GeV/c and/or 2.1 < y < 4.5 for B + and B 0 decays, and 2 < p T < 30 GeV/c and/or 2.1 < y < 4.5 for B 0 s and \u039b 0 b decays. The ranges in p T are not identical due to different trigger requirements between decays with and without muons in the final states.

In the case of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decays, J/\u03c8 mesons consistent with coming from the decay of a b-hadron are selected by requiring that their decay products form a displaced vertex and have large IPs at the PV with respect to which the B candidate has the smallest \u03c7 2 IP . The quantity \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in the vertex-fit \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without the particle under consideration. The B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decays are selected by requiring a two-or threetrack secondary vertex with a significant displacement from all PVs. At least one charged particle must have a transverse momentum p T > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [12] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron. Simulated events are used to determine the signal selection efficiency as a function of p T and y, and to study the modelling of the decay-time resolution, the reconstruction efficiency as function of the decay time and the shape of the invariant mass distribution of partially reconstructed background. In the simulation, protonproton collisions are generated using Pythia [13,4] with a specific LHCb configuration [14]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [15], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [16]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [17,18] as described in Ref. [19].",

These B candidates are called fake, as the probability to form a real decay with this technique is negligible. In order to avoid the introduction of biases in the decay-time measurements, the accompanying pion is selected with requirements on momentum and p T , rather than on IP. The decay-time distribution of these fake B candidates yields an estimate of the decay-time resolution of a real decay. This method is verified by means of simulated events, both for signal and fake B decays. The resolution model, R(t), consisting of a sum of three Gaussian functions with zero mean and three different widths, characterized by an average width of 49 fs, is used. The resolution is found to be overestimated by about 4 fs and to be dependent on the decay time. Taking these effects into account, an uncertainty of 8 fs on the average width is considered as a systematic uncertainty. It is estimated from simulation that the measurement of the decay time is biased by no more than 2 fs, and this effect is also accounted for as a systematic uncertainty.",

The models are validated with a series of fits to the mass and lifetime distributions of events obtained from pseudoexperiments. No evidence of biases on central values nor on the uncertainty is found. Furthermore, a global fit to the total sample of selected candidates is performed for each of the three decay modes to validate the fitting model on data.

As already mentioned, for small values of A CP and A D , the decay rate is to first order only sensitive to the sum of these two quantities. For this reason, A CP is fixed to zero and A D is left as a free parameter in the fits and hence measured from data, oppositely to the B + case, where an external input is necessary for A D .
