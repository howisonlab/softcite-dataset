A separated analysis in bins of m 3 and four-momentum transfer t reveals the interference of resonant and non-resonant particle production and allows their spectral separation. Besides well known resonances we observe a new isovector meson a 1 (1420) at a mass of 1420 MeV/c 2 in the f 0 (980) final state only, the origin of which is unclear. We have also examined the structure of the 0 ++ -isobar in the J P C = 0 \u2212+ , 1 ++ , 2 \u2212+ three pion waves. This clearly reveals the various 0 ++ -isobar components and its correlation to the decay of light mesons.",

            "text": "Light meson spectroscopy has been performed for about 50 years using various tools and production mechanisms, each one possessing its own virtue and sensitivity to particular quantum numbers. Breakthroughs have either been obtained when new mechanisms were opened (e.g. pp annihilation [1] or J / decays [2]) or when the wealth of data allowed new analysis tools to be developed (see e.g. [3]). The COMPASS experiment is a modern high-rate spectrometer which allows three different mechanisms to be probed, diffractive-, central-as well as quasi-real photo-production using the Primakoff reaction. Various beams are being used but in this work we focus on diffractive pion dissociation leading to a 3 final state. This reaction populates iso-vector states with all possible quantum numbers J P , but limited to C = +1. With 10 to100 times more events as compared to previous works we gain new sensitivity to states with very small production cross section, open up the possibility to study our reactions in terms of t as kinematic variable and take a look inside one of the prominent isobars, namely the S-wave.",

The selection of exclusive 3 final states requires a matching of incoming and outgoing momenta as well as transverse momentum balance using the recoil proton.

The analysis follows the usual scheme of a two-step partial-wave analysis [5] where at first all events are subject to a series of fits in bins of m 3 of 20 MeV/c 2 width and in 11 bins of t (mass-independent fit), chosen to equal statistics for each t -bin. The PWA model is based on a sequential two-step decay into a + \u2212 -isobar and a bachelor \u2212 with subsequent decay of the isobar. The population of the 5dimensional phase space is modeled with a set of 88 waves each being characterized by an assumed J P C of the 3 -state, the properties of the isobar, angular momentum L enclosed by \u2212 and isobar as well as magnetic quantum number M and reflectivity , which is connected to the naturality of the exchange. The model allows for seven waves with = \u22121 and one flat-wave representing pure phase space. Both sets add incoherently to the coherent sum of 80 waves with = +1. Only waves with negligible population have been omitted from the fits presented here.

The power of this scheme, which can now be exploited in all its beauty for the first time (but had already been addressed by [3] and [6]) can also be derived from Fig. 2, where we depict the spectral intensity of four different but characteristic partial waves, namely J P C M (isobar ) L = 1 ++ 0 + S, 2 ++ 1 + D, 4 ++ 1 + G and 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) S for two very different intervals of t , dubbed low and high t . While we clearly observe the well established states a 2 (1320) and a 4 (2040) with little change of spectral shape at different t , the structures observed around the a 1 (1260) and 2 (1670) reveal underlying dynamics resulting in a t -dependent shape which cannot be attributed solely to a resonance. As we will see, these issues will be resolved in the second step of our PWA using a mass-dependent fit.",

An example for the results of a fit in one bin of t is shown in Fig. 3. In detail we show the result for two waves with J P C = 1 ++ . Figure 4 depicts examples for the t -dependence of the a 1 (1260) region. The broad structure is composed of the a 1 (1260) resonance interfering constructively (low t ) or destructively (high t ) with a broad non-resonant component (likely caused by the Deck effect [9]).

            "text": "In order to support the parametrization of the S-wave structure by our model we have developed an alternative PWA-method in which we omit a predetermined parametrization and thus \"de-isobar\" our J P C M 0 ++ wave. This is done for each bin in m 3 by replacing the functional isobar description discussed above by a series of step-functions, each defined over a small mass bin of 40 MeV/c 2 , over a mass range of [2m , m 3 \u2212 m ]. The binning is 10 MeV/c 2 around the mass range of the f 0 (980). As we steeply increase the effective number of isobars this fit has been performed in two bins of t only. The result is depicted in Fig. 6 for three partial-waves, 0 \u2212+ , 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ for the 3 -system. In addition to the mass spectra we also extract the Argand diagrams which are depicted in Fig. 7 for t \u2208 [0.2, 1.0] (GeV/c) 2 , in the mass region of the resonances observed, namely (1800), a 1 (1420) and 03002-p.5 EPJ Web of Conferences 2 (1880). It should be noted that the phases are measured w.r.t. the 1 ++ 0 + S wave and contain the sum of both, production and decay phases. The strong dependence of the distributions in Fig. 6 on t is striking and reveals that much of the structure observed in the unresolved distributions is due to nonresonant processes with steeply falling t dependence. Thus we clearly disentangle resonant and nonresonant components and identify the dominant role of the iso-scalar resonances f 0 (980) and f 0 (1500) in the decay process of the three 3 -states (pair of white lines in Fig. 7). The resonance structure is also reflected in the circles observed in the Argand diagrams. Here, the absence of phase motion in the -System related to a 1 (1420) is very distinct (no circle in the Argand diagram visible) and hints to production and decay phase having opposite sign and similar magnitude. We thus conclude that the a 1 (1420) coupling to f 0 (980) is genuine and not an artifact of the isobar parametrization and no strong coupling to the broad component in S-wave channel can be observed. More details, however, require a mass-dependent fit relating the + \u2212 0 ++ mass and phase spectra to the 3 systems.",

This allows to disentangle resonant and non-resonant processes contributing to multi-particle production using the reaction \u2212 + p \u2192 \u2212 \u2212 + + p recoil . We have extracted the a 1 (1260) resonance and observed hints for excited states of the a 1 and a 2 around 1800 \u2212 1900 MeV/c 2 . In particular we have observed a new iso-vector meson a 1 (1420) decaying into f 0 (980) with no clear signs of concurring decay modes. A full phase motion of 180 \u2022 characteristic to resonance production has been observed. The origin of this object with a width of about 140 MeV/c 2 is yet unclear. The similarity in mass and width to the f 1 (1420) strongly coupling to KK * is striking. At present we cannot exclude re-scattering effects involving a coupling of KK * and f 0 (980) as outlined in [11]. A detailed coupled channel analysis including the study of the K K final state would be necessary. In addition we have studied the iso-scalar structure of the isobar in the decay of J P C = 0 \u2212+ , 1 ++ , 2 \u2212+ . A clear coupling of a 1 (1420) to f 0 (980) and of (1800) and 2 (1880) to both, f 0 (980) and f 0 (1500), has been observed in addition to a broad S-wave component, exhibiting a strong t dependence.",
