The branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c6 is measured to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c6) = [5.23 \u00b1 0.06 (stat) \u00b1 0.33 (syst)] \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which agrees well with a previously published measurement, but with a significantly improved precision. No evident enhancement near the pp mass threshold, denoted as X(pp), is observed, and the upper limit on the branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 X(pp)\u03c6 \u2192 pp\u03c6 is determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 X(pp)\u03c6 \u2192 pp\u03c6) < 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at the 90% confidence level.

            "text": "The experimental observations of the X(pp) structure in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp and the absence in other probes raised many discussions in the community resulting in various speculations on its nature. The most popular theoretical interpretations include baryonium [9][10][11], a multiquark state [12] or an effect mainly due to pure final-state interaction (FSI) [13][14][15][16]. In accordance with the latest results of a partial wave analysis (PWA) [4], it was proposed to associate this enhancement with a new resonance, X(1835), that was observed in the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 decay [17,18]. The nature of the X(pp) is still mysterious to date, therefore its investigation via other J/\u03c8 decay modes may shed light on its nature. The decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c6 restricts the isospin of the pp system and is helpful to clarify the role of the pp FSI.",

The average single wire resolution is 135 \u00b5m, and the momentum resolution for 1 GeV/c charged particles in a 1 T magnetic field is 0.5%; 2) a Time-Of-Flight system (TOF) for particle identification (PID) composed of a barrel part constructed of two layers with 88 pieces of 5 cm thick, 2.4 m long plastic scintillators in each layer, and two end caps with 48 fan-shaped, 5 cm thick, plastic scintillators in each end cap.

However, it is found that data deviate strongly from the PHSP MC distributions, as the histograms shown in Fig. 3, where, to subtract the backgrounds, the signal yields of data in each bin are extracted by fitting the \u03c6 signal in the KK invariant mass. The detection efficiency varies significantly at low momenta of proton and anti-proton, and, therefore, strongly depends on the pp invariant mass. To obtain a more accurate detection efficiency, the events of the PHSP MC are weighted according to the observed pp mass distribution, where the weight factor is the ratio of pp mass distributions between data and the PHSP MC in Fig. 3 (b) and (f). The average detection efficiencies are determined to be (30.8 \u00b1 0.2)% and (28.9 \u00b1 0.1)% for \u03c6 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 L and \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , respectively.
