The analysis searches for events involving the production of a single heavy neutral Higgs boson which decays to the charged Higgs boson and a W boson, where the charged Higgs boson subsequently decays into a W boson and the lightest neutral Higgs boson decaying to a bottom-antibottom-quark pair. Such a cascade results in a W-boson pair and a bottom-antibottom-quark pair in the final state. Events with exactly one lepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV at the LHC. The data are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions, and 95% confidence-level upper limits are set on the product of cross section and branching ratio. These limits range from 0.065 to 43 pb as a function of H 0 and H AE masses, with m h 0 fixed at 125 GeV.",

            "text": "Recently, a Higgs boson has been discovered by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] Collaborations with a mass of approximately 125 GeV. This observation has been supported by complementary evidence from the CDF and D0 Collaborations [3]. The study of such a boson, responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry in the Standard Model (SM), is one of the major objectives of experimental highenergy physics. A vital question is whether this state is in fact the Higgs boson of the SM, or part of an extended Higgs sector (such as that of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model [4,5]), a composite Higgs boson [6], or a completely different particle with Higgs-like couplings (such as a radion in warped extra dimensions [7,8] or a dilaton [9]).",

Rather than assuming a particular theoretical model, this analysis follows a simplified model approach by searching for a specific multi-Higgs-boson cascade topology [10]. Many beyond-the-SM Higgs models introduce a second Higgs doublet. In addition to the h 0 , such models contain a heavy charged Higgs-boson pair H AE and a heavier neutral state H 0 . An additional pseudoscalar particle, A, may also exist within the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [11] framework, but this analysis assumes it to be too heavy to participate in the cascade decay considered here.",

In this search, one of the W bosons is assumed to decay to hadrons leading to jets and the other one decays to an electron plus a neutrino (e \u00fe jets) or a muon plus a neutrino (\u03bc \u00fe jets). The same final state has been used by CDF in a similar search for Higgs-boson cascades [12]. Other related searches have been performed for charged Higgs bosons in top-quark decays t \u2192 H \u00fe b [13][14][15][16][17][18].

The matrix method is a technique to estimate the number of events with a fake, isolated lepton in the signal selection, and uses loose and tight isolation definitions for leptons. The tight isolation definitions are those used in this analysis, and tight leptons are a subset of the loose leptons. In a selection dominated by real leptons, the efficiency (\u03f5 real ) of a loose lepton to also pass the tight isolation requirements is measured. The rate (\u03f5 fake ) of loose leptons passing the tight requirements is measured in a multijet-dominated selection.

These sources are added in quadrature and listed as one systematic uncertainty in Table II. As a further uncertainty, the jet energy is smeared to cover any disagreements in the jet energy resolution measured in data and in simulated event samples. A jet reconstruction efficiency [69] systematic uncertainty is applied by randomly discarding a fraction of low-p T jets in the simulated events. The jet b-tagging efficiencies are evaluated in data and MC [58]. The difference is corrected with a scale factor, the uncertainty of which is treated as a systematic uncertainty. A small discrepancy in the efficiency of the JVF requirement has been observed between data and MC simulation. The JVF requirement is varied to cover this observed discrepancy, and the resulting change in the expected background is taken as a systematic uncertainty.",

As default, both scales are set to \u00f0m 2 W \u00fe \u00f0p W T \u00de 2 \u00de and this is varied by factors of 2 and by changing the form to \u00f0m 2 W \u00fe P jets p 2 T \u00de.

An overall uncertainty of 4% is applied to the W-boson \u00fe jets estimate due to uncertainties in the cross section, with an additional 24% per jet added in quadrature due to the uncertainty in Berends scaling [72]. This results in a 48% uncertainty for events with four jets, contributing to the overall 5.5% uncertainty on the background normalization. The systematic uncertainty due to single top-quark, diboson, and Z-boson \u00fe jets production is evaluated by varying their cross sections within their uncertainties as described in Ref. [52].

NLO electroweak corrections are also applied, as well as QCD soft-gluon resummations up to next-to-next-to-leading log. Using this benchmark, the cross-section upper limits observed are greater than the theoretical cross sections of the heavy Higgs boson, H 0 , for all mass points tested.

No significant excess of events above the expectation from the SM background was found and limits on the production cross section have been set.",
