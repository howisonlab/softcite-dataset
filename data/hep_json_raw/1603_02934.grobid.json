The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a wellperforming calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.",

In the ATLAS experiment [1], clusters of topologically connected calorimeter cell signals (topo-clusters) are employed as a principal signal definition for use in the reconstruction of the (hadronic) part of the final state comprising isolated hadrons, jets and hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons. In addition, topo-clusters are also used to represent the energy flow from softer particles, which is needed for the reconstruction of fullevent observables such as the missing transverse momentum.",

A similar application in this particular environment, previously developed by the D0 Collaboration, implements the topological clustering in the two dimensions spanned by pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle, thus applying the noise-suppression strat-egy inherent in this algorithm for jet reconstruction [5]. Several features and aspects of the ATLAS topo-cluster algorithms and their validations have previously been presented in Refs. [6][7][8][9].",

These two changes in the run conditions introduced a sensitivity of the LAr calorimeter signal to the signal residuals from proton-proton interactions occurring in N PU BX \u2248 12 preceding bunch crossings at the LHC (outof-time pile-up), in addition to pile-up interactions in the current bunch crossing (in-time pile-up). The out-of-time pile-up effect on the cell signal depends on N PU BX \u2248 \u03c4 signal /t BX and the energy deposited in each of the N PU BX bunch crossings. The bipolar shape of the LAr calorimeter signal shown in Fig. 3 reduces the overall effect of pile-up, because it features a net-zero integral over time. This leads to cancellation on average of in-time pile-up signal contributions by out-oftime pile-up signal residuals in any given calorimeter cell. By design of the shaping amplifier, and the choice of digitally sampling the shaped pulse amplitude in time with a frequency of 40 MHz in the read-out, the most efficient suppression is achieved for 25 ns bunch spacing in the LHC beams. It is fully effective in the limit where for each bunch crossing contributing to out-of-time pile-up about the same amount of energy is deposited in a given calorimeter cell. A small loss of efficiency is observed for 50 ns bunch spacing, due to the less frequent injection of energy by the fewer previous bunch crossings.",

This history gets filled with signal remnants from an increasing number of past bunch crossings with protonproton interactions the larger the time difference between the bunch crossing and the beginning of the train becomes. The remaining bunch crossings in a train, about 26 of a total of 36 in 2011 and 62 of a total of 72 in 2012, have an out-of-time pile-up signal contribution which is stable within the bunchto-bunch fluctuations in the beam intensity. In 2012 data a dedicated cell-by-cell correction is applied in the offline cell signal reconstruction to compensate for the corresponding variations in the out-of-time pile-up. Further details of the The pulse shape in the ATLAS LAr calorimeters. The unipolar triangular pulse is the current pulse in the liquid argon generated by fast ionising particles. Its characteristic time is the drift time (charge collection time) t d , with t d \u2248 450 ns in the example for the central EMB calorimeter shown here. The shaped pulse is superimposed, with a characteristic duration of \u03c4 signal \u2248 600 ns. The full circles on the shaped pulse indicate the nominal bunch crossings at 25 ns intervals. The figure has been adapted from Ref. [14] ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeter read-out and signal processing can be found in Ref. [15]. Even with a constant proton bunch intensity and apart from the bunch train effects, the efficiency of pile-up suppression by signal shaping is reduced by the large fluctuations in the number of additional interactions from bunch crossing to bunch crossing, and by the different energy-flow patterns of the individual collisions in the time window of sensitivity \u03c4 signal in the LAr calorimeters. Consequently, the signal shows a principal sensitivity to pile-up, even after shaping and digital filtering in the read-out. This is evident from the residual event-by-event deviation of the cell-signal baseline, which depends on the specific pile-up condition at the time of the triggered event, from the (average zero) baseline expected from the signal shaping. These baseline fluctuations can lead to relevant signal offsets once the noise suppression is applied, which is an important part of the calorimeter signal extraction strategy using topo-clusters presented in Sect. 3.",

The actual N PU is drawn from a Poisson distribution around the average number \u03bc of additional proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing. The value of \u03bc is measured by the experiment as an average over one luminosity block, which can last as long as two minutes, with its actual duration depending on the central data acquisition configuration at the time of the data-taking. The measurement of \u03bc is mainly based on single \u03b7-hemisphere hit counting as well as counting coincidental hits in both \u03b7-hemispheres with the fast ATLAS luminosity detectors consisting of two small Cherenkov counter (LUCID; 5.6 < |\u03b7| < 6.0) and two sets of small diamond sensors forming two beam conditions monitors (BCM; |\u03b7| = 4.2). Details of these detectors and the measurement are given in Ref. [28]. The distribution of the measured \u03bc over the whole run period is taken into account in the pile-up simulation.",

The generated hard-scatter event is simulated using the detector simulation described in Sect. 2.1, but without any noise effects included. The recorded and simulated raw electronic signals are then overlaid prior to the digitisation step in the simulation. This results in modelling both the detector noise and the effect of pile-up from data with the correct experimental conditions on top of the simulated event.

This is due to the dominance of the negative seed and the correlation between this seed signal and signals in the neighbouring cells, which likely also have E EM cell < 0. If a negative seed signal is generated by out-of-time pile-up, it is induced by a particle injected into the calorimeter more than 100 ns before the event. Its residual signal trace is scaled by the negative undershoot of the shaping function shown in Fig. 3. This particle also injected significant energy in the neighbouring cells at the same time, due to its electromagnetic or hadronic shower, which leads to E EM cell < 0 in these cells at the time of the event. For the same reasons, topo-clusters from out-of-time pile-up seeded by E EM cell > 0 often yield E EM clus > 0, because they are typically generated by particles injected in past bunch crossings closer in time (within 100 ns). The topo-clusters with E EM clus < 0 can be used to provide an average global cancellation of contributions of clusters seeded by positive fluctuations in out-of-time pile-up in full event observables including E miss T [44]. Clustering cells with E EM cell < 0 in any topo-cluster, including those containing and seeded by large positive signals, improves noise suppression due to the local cancellation of random positive (upward) noise fluctuations by negative (downward) fluctuations within this cluster.

The immediate expectation is that the clustering algorithm should be very efficient in reconstructing one cluster for each particle entering the calorimeter. While this view is appropriate for dense and highly compact electromagnetic showers with relatively small shower-to-shower fluctuations in their longitudinal (along the direction of flight of the incoming particle) and lateral (perpendicular to the direction of flight) extensions, hadronic showers are subject to much larger intrinsic fluctuations leading to large shower-to-shower variations in their shapes and compactness. Hadrons generated in inelastic interactions in the course of the hadronic shower can even travel significant distances and generate sub-showers outside the direct neighbourhood of the calorimeter cell containing the initial hadronic interaction. This means that topo-clusters can contain only a fraction of the hadronic shower.

This is demonstrated by the N clus distribution for topo-clusters generated by \u03c0 0 at |\u03b7| = 0.3 in ATLAS in Fig.  7a peaking at N clus = 1, with a probability only slightly larger than the one for N clus = 2.

While the particular reason for the second cluster depends on effects introduced by local features including the calorimeter readout granularity and cell noise levels at a given direction \u03b7, hypothesis (1) is found to be least likely as it is observed that the energy sharing between the two topo-clusters is typically very asymmetric. The leading topo-cluster generated by \u03c0 0 at 100 GeV contains very close to 100 % of the total energy in this calorimeter region, indicating that the second and any further topo-clusters arise from hypotheses (2) and (3).

The small EM-like area at the edge of the HAD-like region stems from neutral pions showering late. These areas are typical in regions of the detector where the second layer of the EM calorimeter is thinner and substantial parts of the shower are deposited in its last layer. The larger volume of the cells in this last layer leads to the reduced energy density while the position at the back of the EM calorimeter means a larger \u03bb clus simulations, thus maintaining the correct isospin-preserving ratio.",

(30) located in a bin ijkl with P EM clus,ijkl \u2265 0.5 is classified as EM and with P EM clus,ijkl < 0.5 is classified as HAD. In the rare case where a topo-cluster has too few cells or too little signal to meaningfully reconstruct the observables in O class clus , the cluster is likely generated by noise or insignificant energy deposits and is thus neither classified nor further corrected nor calibrated. An example of a P EM clus distribution in a given phase space bin ij is shown in Fig. 10. All distributions and their bin contents are accessed as lookup tables to find P EM clus for a given cluster. The distributions of \u03bb clus for topo-clusters in jets reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm with R = 0.6 are shown for clusters respectively classified as electromagnetic or hadronic, in 2010 data and MC simulations (no pile-up) in Figs. 11a and b. The specific structure of each distribution reflects the longitudinal segmentation of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters in ATLAS. The average cluster depth \u03bb clus as a function of the cluster energy is shown in Figs. 11c and d for the same EM and HAD topo-clusters, respectively. The EM topo-clusters show the expected linear dependence of \u03bb clus on log E EM clus in Fig. 11c, with some modulations introduced by the read-out granu-larity of the EMC. The \u03bb clus dependence on E EM clus shown for HAD topo-clusters in Fig. 11d features a similar shape up to E EM clus \u2248 2 GeV. This energy range is dominated by topo-clusters from low-energy hadrons, in addition to clusters from less-energetic hadronic shower fragments created by the splitting algorithm described in Sect. 3.1.3. For E EM clus > 2 GeV the average \u03bb clus is increasingly dominated by higher-energy clusters produced by splitting and located in the electromagnetic calorimeter, thus pulling it to lower values. The rise of \u03bb clus for topo-clusters with E EM clus 10 GeV reflects increasing contributions from energetic hadrons with dense showers generating high-energy clusters deeper in the hadronic calorimeter. The good agreement between data and MC simulations for both classes of topo-clusters supports the use of \u03bb clus for the cluster classification derived from MC simulations for data [38].",

The cell location is defined by one of the sampling layer identifiers S calo listed in Table 1  The E EM cell distribution in the PreSampler and the \u03c1 cell distribution in the the EMB2 sampling of the central electromagmetic calorimeter are shown in Fig. 12 for cells in topo-clusters inside jets reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm using a distance parameter R = 0.6. Discrepancies between data and MC simulations mostly in the high-end tails of the distributions indicate more compact electromagnetic showers in the simulation. This is also seen in Fig. 13a for the \u03c1 cell distribution for the same kind of jets in the EME2 sampling of the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter. Better agreement between data and MC simulations over the whole spectrum is observed for the \u03c1 cell distributions in the first module (FCAL0) of the forward calorimeter shown in Fig. 13b, and in the second sampling of the central hadronic (Tile1) and the first sampling of the hadronic end-cap (HEC0) calorimeters shown in Fig. 14. Overall, the quality of the modelling of the cell signal densities is sufficient for topo-cluster calibration purposes. The figures are taken from Ref. [38]. as observed inside anti-k t jets with R = 0.6, calibrated with the GCW + JES scheme described in Ref. [38], in 2010 data and MC simulations (no pile-up). The data/MC ratio of the spectra is shown below the corresponding distributions. The figure uses plots from Ref.

The energy losses introduced by this effect are estimated using single-particle MC simulations. A corresponding out-of-cluster correction is determined and applied to nearby topo-clusters. The cells with true energy not included into clusters are referred to as lost cells.",

A topo-cluster in a jet is likely to have directly neighbouring clusters which can capture its out-of-cluster signal loss. It is therefore expected that topo-clusters in jets need less out-of-cluster corrections than isolated topo-clusters away from other clusters. The degree of isolation is measured by the isolation moment f iso introduced in Sect. 4.2.5. The out-of-cluster correction is effectively f iso w ooc clus (O ooc clus ). This correction can change the barycentre and centre of gravity of topo-clusters containing cells from the LAr pre-samplers or the Tile scintillators. Figure 16 shows f iso for topo-clusters classified as either electromagnetic or hadronic in jets reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm and R = 0.6 [38]. A good agreement between data and MC simulations is observed, both for the details of the respective f iso in Figs. 16a and b and the average as a function of E EM clus in Figs. 16c and d. The E EM clus dependence of f iso is very similar for both kinds of topoclusters. The peak structure in the f iso distributions shown in Figs. 16a and b is indicative of topo-clusters which have a large fraction of their energy in one sampling layer in the (regular) ATLAS calorimeter read-out segmentation with at least 16 cells around the perimeter of clustered cells in a sampling layer. The isolation of this layer then dominates the overall f iso , as given by Eq. (28) in Sect. 4.2.5. This dominance of just one sampling layer with the minimal number of cells is typical for topo-clusters seeded by a cell barely above the seed threshold defined in Eq. (3) and too little energy in the neighbouring samplings to further expand the cluster. Neighbouring cells then limit f iso to the multiples Table 2 Overview of the signals used to correct for dead material losses in the various regions around the ATLAS calorimeters. The numbered regions are shown in Fig. 17. The parameter values used for the dead material correction are extracted from lookup tables. Region 8 com-prises all dead material volumes with energy loss outside regions 1-7. These are mostly small volumes located between and behind the active calorimeters  Figs. 16a and b. Even multiples of 1/16 occur more often than odd multiples since they can be produced more easily by topo-clusters with a different number of neighbours. The fact that clusters close to the noise threshold are mainly responsible for the peaks explains the mismatch between data and MC simulations observed in the peak heights, and points to non-perfect modelling of noise and very small signals. The overall structure of the f iso spectrum in data is well reproduced in terms of the peak locations by MC simulations.",

This material is divided into virtual cells with a pointing geometry in (\u03b7, \u03c6). These cells are similar to the ATLAS calorimeter cells, but typically larger in size.

Figure 25 shows the average \u2202 N clus /\u2202\u03b7 (\u03b7 clus ) for these topo-cluster selections, for data and MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up. The shape observed especially for the less restrictive selections with p T,min \u2264 500 MeV in Fig. 25a-d, reflects the variations of the calorimeter segmentation and the effect of sub-detector transition regions on the topo-cluster formation across the full ATLAS acceptance |\u03b7 clus | < 4.9. Generally, MC simulations describe the p T -flow better than the number of clusters. This is expected as the description of the summed p T -flow is constrained with more weight in the numerical fits for the ATLAS tunes than the particle number density.",

This is a consequence of the reduction of the calorimeter cell granularity by about a factor of four in terms of pseudorapidity and azimuth ( \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6), which reduces the number of potential topo-cluster seeds. The granularity change also introduces more signal overlap between individual particles in any given cell and thus less spatial resolution for the reconstruction of the corresponding energy flow due to this merging of particle signals. In addition, the larger cells increase the noise thresholds, as shown in Figs. 4b and  c, which changes the calorimeter sensitivity. This change of sensitivity can be evaluated by comparing p EM T,clus with the corresponding quantity The geometry effect yields the steep drop in topo-cluster number density at this boundary. Raising the transverse momentum threshold for accepted topo-clusters increasingly mitigates the geometrical and noise effects on the cluster number density. The data/MC comparison shows larger deficiencies for more inclusive topo-cluster selections, which capture more signals from pile-up. It improves as the p T,min threshold increases, when the selections are dominated by clusters that are generated by harder emissions than those due to pile-up.",

Applying the (inclusive) p EM T,clus > 0 selection yields more topo-clusters in MC simulations than in data in the selected central (|\u03b7| < 0.2) and end-cap (2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.2) regions, with the difference rising with increasing \u03bc in Figs. 27a and c. In the forward region the number of topo-clusters in MC simulations is closer to the number in data for low \u03bc, but tends to be lower than data at higher \u03bc, as seen in Fig. 27e. These qualitative differences between the observations for the central and end-cap regions and the forward region can arise from the modelling of soft physics, which is tuned with reconstructed charged tracks in the detector region |\u03b7| < 2.5 but is not experimentally constrained in the forward region. In addition, imperfections in the description of the inactive material in front of the calorimeter in the detector simulation    can change the acceptance for low-energy particles significantly in different ways in the various \u03b7-regions. Also, mismodelling in the simulation of the (mostly hadronic) lateral and longitudinal shower spreads in the calorimeters, as e.g. documented in Refs. [49,50], can lead to different topo-cluster splitting behaviour in the different calorimeter regions. In particular the increased signal overlap between particles in the forward region is suspected to introduce a higher sensitivity of the cluster splitting to the detector simulation.",

In addition, the increased cell noise can produce additional signal minima in groups of previ-ously connected cells in the topo-cluster.

The topo-cluster depth location \u03bb clus discussed here serves as an example for the quality of modelling cluster moments in the presence of pile-up. Other moments are investigated in the context of jets. The modelling of \u03bb clus in the calorimeter is compared to data in Fig. 28 for the inclusive Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc sample in the same bins of \u03b7 clus used for the study of p T,clus in Fig. 22. The fully simulated events with pile-up from the minimum-bias simulations show significant differences from the data, while the MC simulations overlaid with pile-up from data show good agreement with respect to all features of these distributions. The complex structure of the distributions reflects the longitudinal calorimeter segmentation in the various regions defined by \u03b7 clus . For example, the forward direction 3.8 < |\u03b7 clus | < 4.0 is covered by the FCAL, which has three coarse and deep longitudinal segments (approximately 2.5/3.5/3.5 \u03bb nucl ). This structure generates topo-clusters preferably in the depth centre of each module, as can be seen in Figs. 28e and f. These distributions are dominated by low-energy clusters associated with pile-up interactions such that the improvement seen by using data overlay is expected.",

The corresponding p T responses p EM T,jet and p LCW T,jet are therefore affected by pile-up. A full jet energy scale (JES) calibration is applied to both scales, yielding P EM+JES jet and P LCW+JES jet , respectively. This JES calibration includes pile-up corrections, response calibration, direction corrections and refinements from in situ transverse momentum balances, similar to those outlined for 2011 data in Ref. [16]. with increasing \u03bc, the dependence of this ratio on \u03bc is less pronounced for jets with 3.5 < |\u03b7 jet | < 4.5 in the FCAL calorimeter. This observation is related to the much coarser calorimeter geometry in this region, in addition to the different (faster) shaping function in the FCAL, yielding a better average online in-time pile-up suppression by the out-of-time pile-up signal history in 2012 running conditions (50 ns bunch crossings). Figure 31 shows the distributions of the number of topo-clusters (N jet clus ) in central, end-cap and forward jets. Distributions are shown using fully simulated pile-up and using data overlay. The discrepancies between MC simulations and data, while slightly reduced in the simulations employing the pileup overlaid from data, generally persist. The data/MC comparisons of the cluster multiplicity distributions counting only topo-clusters with p EM T,clus > 1 GeV for the same Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc data and MC simulations are shown in Fig. 32. This comparison is significantly improved with respect to Fig. 31, indicating that the number of low-energy topo-clusters in jets is poorly simulated. The comparison of data to MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up and with pile-up overlaid from data for the more inclusive cluster multiplicities in Fig. 31 indicates that pile-up is likely not the main source for the deficiencies in the MC simulation, as the comparison does not improve significantly when pileup is taken from the data. This observation, together with the insensitivity of the data/MC comparison of the multiplicity of harder topo-clusters to the choice of pile-up modelling in MC simulations shown in Fig. 32, suggests that the deficiencies in the simulation of the low-energy topo-cluster multiplicity arise from imperfections in the detector model, response or tuning of the parton shower and other sources of soft emissions, including multiple parton interactions in the underlying event, rather than from the modelling of pileup or electronic noise. clus are nearly independent of \u03bc in the central detector region, they show more complex dependencies on the pile-up activity in the end-cap region. The loss of hard topo-clusters in both the overall jet and in its core with increasing \u03bc reflects additional cluster splitting induced by the diffuse energy flow from pileup in the end-cap calorimeters. The observations in both the central and the end-cap regions are well described by MC simulations.",

This number shows only a small increase with increasing \u03bc, as shown in Fig. 33c. This is due to the fact that the cluster splitting behaviour does not change with increasing pile-up in the coarse granularity of the FCAL. In this module, the residual signal contribution from pile-up shifts a small number of additional clusters above the 2 GeV threshold, yielding an increase of about 10 % for both N jet clus and N core clus for \u03bc < 10 to \u03bc > 30. A comparison of N jet clus (\u03bc) with and without the p EM T,clus > 2 GeV selection shows that the cut occasionally removes a topo-cluster from a forward jet such that N jet clus is reduced by not more than 15 % for any given \u03bc. The selection affects N core clus (\u03bc) in a different way. While N core clus (\u03bc) \u2248 const without the cut, the average number of topo-clusters in the jet core passing the p EM T,clus selection is smaller by approximately 15 % in the region of lower pile-up activity, where N jet clus (\u03bc < 10) \u2248 N core clus (\u03bc < 10) both with and without the selection. It is only about 5 % smaller for higher pile-up, where N jet clus (\u03bc > 30) > N core clus (\u03bc > 30) independent of the cut, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 33b with d for forward jets.",

In addition, comparing Figs. 34 and 35 shows that the p EM T,clus > 1 GeV selection predominantly removes topo-clusters at small depth \u03bb clus , as the distributions are depopulated more for smaller values of \u03bb clus than for larger ones.

The shapes observed in the central and end-cap detector regions reflect this classification of the leading topo-cluster. The rightmost peak is mostly produced by topo-clusters that are generated by elec-tromagnetic showers and predominantly calibrated as such. In this case the calibration corrections consist of relatively small out-of-cluster and dead material corrections only, as outlined in Sect. 5. As a consequence, E EM clus /E LCW clus is closer to unity. Topo-clusters classified as hadronic receive much larger corrections, and are more likely to populate the lower side of the E EM clus /E LCW clus spectrum. The E EM clus /E LCW clus distribution in the forward detector region shown in Fig. 38c does not display these shapes. This is due to a lack of classification power in the coarse geometry of the FCAL. Here most topo-clusters are classified as hadronic and receive relatively large corrections. The populated ranges of E EM clus /E LCW clus in Figs. 38a and b indicate that the magnitude of the total correction scaling the basic cluster signal E EM clus up to the locally calibrated signal E LCW clus reaches considerably higher values in the central region than in the end-cap detector regions. This reflects the fact that the incoming particle energies are higher at larger |\u03b7| for a given range in jet p T . Therefore, the calorimeter response to hadrons relative to the response to electrons and photons (e/\u03c0 ) rises with increasing |\u03b7|, and reduces the amount of corrections needed. This effect is initially expected to be observed when comparing the end-cap with the forward region displayed in Fig. 38c as well, yet in the FCAL the out-of-cluster and dead material corrections are larger than the hadronic calibration addressing e/\u03c0 > 1 and thus dominate the overall LCW calibration.",

The pile-up activity is measured in terms of \u03bc for this evaluation. A small linear drop of f lead (\u03bc) is observed for increasing \u03bc in all three detector regions in Fig. 40a. This signal loss of the leading topo-cluster can arise from two effects. First, the increase of the out-of-time pileup contributions due to the rising \u03bc reduces the signal due to the bipolar signal shaping function employed in the ATLAS LAr calorimeters (see discussion in Sect. 2.2.1). Second, the increasing in-time pile-up contributions at higher \u03bc and the increased noise introduced by more out-of-time pile-up leads to additional splitting in the topo-cluster formation, which can take signal away from the leading cluster in the jets. Figure 40b shows that the overall LCW calibration applied to the leading topo-cluster, measured by the average ratio E EM clus /E LCW clus , in the end-cap and forward detector regions is stable against increasing pile-up activity. A slight drop can be observed with increasing \u03bc in the central detector region, which indicates changes in the topo-cluster properties relevant to the LCW calibration introduced by increasing pile-up. One possible reason for that may be effects on the topo-cluster splitting in this region, as pile-up can induce spatial energy distributions leading to modifications in the splitting even for hard signal clusters. 17 The depth location \u03bb clus , which enters the LCW calibration in the classification step discussed in Sect. 5.2, is found to be rather stable against pile-up, as shown in Fig. 40c. The pile-up dependence of the leading topo-cluster features discussed here are found to be well modelled in MC simulations with fully simulated pileup.",

The MC simulations reproduce the shape of the \u03bb 2 distributions from data well in the central and forward regions, with some deficiencies observed in the end-cap region. The shapes in the central and end-cap region are due to leading topo-clusters contained in the electromagnetic calorimeters populating the left peak of the distribution (short clusters) and leading topo-clusters in the hadronic calorimeters populating the right peak with longer clusters. The shape of the length distribution in the forward region shown in Fig. 42c is characterised by a sharp drop on the right of the spectrum, which corresponds to the half-depth of cells (225 mm) in the FCAL modules. This shows that in this detector region the leading topo-cluster rarely extends into all three  FCAL modules, as indicated by only few topo-clusters with \u03bb 2 > 225 mm. The leading cluster is more likely to share its energy between the first two modules FCAL0 and FCAL1, with \u03bb 2 \u2248 225 mm indicating a near equal share and \u03bb 2 < 225 mm indicating that most of the cluster energy is in FCAL0.",

The residual effects of pile-up on cluster kinematics and observables in data are well controlled in that they can be reproduced with sufficient precision in MC simulations for topo-clusters either inside or outside jets. The largest observed data-MC differences mainly arise from imperfect modelling of the soft collision physics affecting pile-up. Overlaying pile-up from data on gener-  ated hard-scatter interactions in MC simulations yields significantly better agreement for most kinematic variables and topo-cluster moments.",

They provide noise suppression important for a high-quality calorimeter signal, and in this reduce the amount of data needed to represent the final state in the detector. Their spatial resolution allows not only detailed analysis of the energy flow in the proton-proton collision events as needed for E miss T reconstruction but also analysis of more localised energyflow structures inside jets. This is done routinely in boostedobject reconstruction techniques applied in jet substructure analysis, with recent examples from ATLAS discussed in Refs.

The dependence of the number of clusters N jet clus forming the anti-k t jets of size R = 0.4 and with 30 GeV < p LCW+JES T,jet < 40 GeV as a function of the pile-up activity, measured by \u03bc, is shown in Fig. 33. As indicated in Fig. 33a, N jet clus rises approximately linearly with increasing \u03bc in the central and end-cap detector regions. The gradient of this rise is much smaller in the forward region, where the coarser read-out geometry and the signal shaping effects already discussed in Sect. 6.3.1 in the context of Fig. 30b lead to merging and suppression of pile-up signals. Figure 33a also confirms the already mentioned deficiencies in the MC simulation of the absolute values of the most inclusive N jet clus in any given \u03bc range, except for the forward detector region. The slope of N jet clus (\u03bc), on the other hand, compares well with data. The number of topo-clusters in the core of the jet (N core clus ) is defined by counting the clusters at distances R < 0.3 around the jet axis. Figure 33b shows a residual dependence of the average N core clus on \u03bc in the central and end-cap regions, with significant differences between data and the predictions from MC simulations. The figure shows good data/MC agreement for N core clus in the forward region. Comparing N jet clus (\u03bc) in Fig. 33a with N core clus (\u03bc) in Fig. 33b shows a steeper slope for N jet clus (\u03bc) than for N core clus (\u03bc) in the central and endcap calorimeter regions. Pile-up interactions add more topoclusters at the margin of the jet than in the core. For forward jets, N jet clus rises only slightly with increasing \u03bc, while N core clus shows no observable dependency on pile-up. Calculating N jet clus and N core clus with only considering topoclusters with p EM T,clus > 2 GeV yields the result for the pile-up dependence of N jet clus and N core clus displayed in Figs. 33c and d, respectively.
