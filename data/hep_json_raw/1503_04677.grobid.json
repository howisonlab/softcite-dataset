A spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton (G * ) is used to model a narrow resonance decaying to a W W final state. The KK graviton interpretation is based on an extended Randall-Sundrum model of a warped extra dimension (RS1) [8] where the SM fields can propagate into the bulk of the extra dimension. This extended \"bulk\" RS model, referred to as bulk e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch RS hereafter, avoids constraints on the original RS1 model from limits on flavour-changing neutral currents and electroweak precision tests, and has a dimensionless coupling constant k/M Pl \u223c 1, where k is the curvature of the warped extra dimension andM Pl = M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass. A spin-1 gauge boson (W ) of the sequential standard model with modified coupling to W Z, also referred to as the extended gauge model (EGM) [7], is used to model a narrow resonance that decays to a W Z final state. The EGM introduces W and Z bosons with SM couplings to fermions and with the coupling strength of the heavy W to W Z modified by a mixing factor \u03be = c \u00d7 (m W /m W ) 2 relative to the SM couplings, where m W and m W are the pole masses of the W and W bosons respectively, and c is a coupling scaling factor. In this scenario the partial width of the W boson scales linearly with m W , leading to a narrow resonance over the accessible mass range. The width of the W resonance at 1 TeV is approximately 35 GeV.",

To ensure the orthogonality of the signal regions, events are assigned exclusively to the first region for which the criteria are fulfilled, applying sequentially the MR, HRR, and LRR event selection. The hadronically decaying W/Z candidate is formed by combining the two small-R jets with highest p T in the resolved regions and its invariant mass m j j is required to be between 65 and 105 GeV. In the LRR (HRR), the event is required to have p \u03bd T > 100 (300) GeV, p j j T > 100 (300) GeV and \u03c6( j, E miss T ) > 1, where \u03c6( j, E miss T ) is the azimuthal angle between the leading jet and the missing transverse momentum. The HRR additionally requires the two leading jets to have p T > 80 GeV. In the MR, the large-R jet with the highest p T is selected as the hadronically decaying W/Z candidate and p \u03bd T > 400 GeV is also imposed. The jet mass of the selected large-R jet (m J ) is required to be consistent with a W/Z boson mass (65 < m J < 105 GeV) and the azimuthal angle between the jet and the missing transverse momentum, \u03c6(J, E miss T ), is required to satisfy \u03c6(J, E miss T ) > 1.

This uncertainty is 3-4 % in the LRR and HRR, and 13-19 % in the MR. An uncertainty on the shape of the W/Z + jets background is obtained in the LRR by comparing data and simulation in the m j j sidebands, leading to an approximately 5 % uncertainty for m \u03bd j j < 600 GeV. Due to the low numbers of data events in the sidebands for the HRR and MR, the W + jets shape uncertainty in these regions is evaluated by comparing a sample of simulated events from Sherpa with a sample of simulated events from Alpgen [46] interfaced to Pythia6. The uncertainty in the shape of the tt mass distribution is estimated by comparing a sample from MC@NLO interfaced to Herwig with a sample from Powheg [47-49] interfaced to Pythia6. The uncertainty on the shape of the multijet background is evaluated by using alternative templates obtained by removing the calorimeter-based lepton isolation cuts. For the remaining background processes, detector-related uncertainties from the small-R jet energy scale and resolution, large-R jet energy and mass scale, lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies, lepton momentum scales and resolutions, and missing transverse momentum were considered when evaluating possible systematic effects on the shape or normalization of the background estimation and are found to have a minor impact. The large-R jet energy and mass scale uncertainties are evaluated by comparing the ratio of calorimeter-based to track-based measurements in dijet data and simulation, and are validated by in-situ data of highp T W production in association with jets.",

[50], from a calibration of the luminosity scale derived from beam-separation scans performed in November 2012. Table 1 shows the number of events predicted and observed in each signal region. The reconstructed m \u03bd j j (m \u03bd J ) distributions for data and predicted background events as well as selected benchmark signal models in the three signal regions are shown in Fig. 1 for the combined electron and muon channels. Good agreement is observed between the data and the background prediction. In the absence of a significant excess, the result is interpreted as 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio for the G * and W models. These upper limits are determined with the CL s modified frequentist formalism [51] with a profile-likelihood test statistic [52]. The test statistic is evaluated with a maximum-likelihood fit of signal models and background predictions to the reconstructed m \u03bd j j (m \u03bd J ) spectra. Systematic uncertainties are taken into account as nuisance parameters with Gaussian sampling distributions. For each source of systematic uncertainty, the correlations across bins and between different kinematic regions, as well as those between signal and background, are taken into account. The likelihood fit is performed for signal pole masses between 300 and 800 GeV for the LRR, 600-1000 GeV for the HRR and 800-2000 GeV for the MR. Overlapping regions are fit simultaneously. Figure 2 shows 95 % CL upper limits on the production cross section multiplied by the branching fraction into W W (W Z) for the bulk RS G * (EGM W ) as a function of the resonance pole mass. The theoretical predictions for the EGM W with a scale factor c = 1 and the bulk RS G * with coupling constant k/M Pl = 1, shown in the figure, allow observed lower mass limits of 1490 GeV for the W and 700 GeV for the G * to be extracted.",

No evidence for resonant diboson production is observed and 95 % CL upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of G * and W are determined.

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).",
