            "text": "High transverse momentum jets produced in pp collisions at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV are used to measure the transverse energy-energy correlation function and its associated azimuthal asymmetry. The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in the year 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 158 pb \u22121 . The selection criteria demand the average transverse momentum of the two leading jets in an event to be larger than 250 GeV. The data at detector level are well described by Monte Carlo event generators. They are unfolded to the particle level and compared with theoretical calculations at next-to-leading-order accuracy. The agreement between data and theory is good and provides a precision test of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics at large momentum transfers. From this comparison, the strong coupling constant given at the Z boson mass is determined to be \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.1173 \u00b1 0.0010 (exp.) +0.0065 \u22120.0026 (theo.).",

This is done using an MC-based correction, in bins of \u03b7 and p T , derived from the relation of the reconstructed jet energy to the energy of the corresponding hadron-level jet, not including muons or non-interacting particles. In a final step, an in situ calibration corrects for residual differences in the jet response between the MC simulation and the data using momentum-balance techniques for dijet, \u03b3 + jet, Z + jet and multi-jet final states. This so-called jet energy scale (JES) [61] is subject to uncertainties including those affecting the energy of well-measured objects, like Z bosons and photons. The total JES uncertainty is given by a set of independent sources, correlated in p T . The uncertainty in the p T of individual jets due to the JES increases from (1-4)% for |\u03b7| < 1.8, to 5% for 1.8 < |\u03b7| < 4.5.",

These uncertainties depend on the jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The total uncertainty due to the JES is calculated as the sum in quadrature of all independent uncertainties. In order to investigate the effect of possible correlations between JES sources in the analysis, two alternative scenarios with weaker and stronger correlations have been considered [61]. The impact of the change of correlation configurations, as well as of the number of JES independent sources, on the value of \u03b1 s (m Z ) and its experimental error is found to be negligible. The values of the JES uncertainty are typically asymmetric for both the TEEC and ATEEC distributions, although the values for this asymmetry are small. Thus, the positive and negative parts of the uncertainty are independently summed in quadrature. The TEEC distribution has a total uncertainty of up to 3.5% from the JES sources, the largest contributions being due to close-by jets and to the different response to jets initiated by gluons or quarks.

The renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen to be (p T1 + p T2 )/2, ranging from 250 to 1300 GeV and with an average value of 305 GeV. Through their construction, both the TEEC and ATEEC functions are less affected by experimental effects such as the jet energy scale and resolution or pileup than absolute cross-section measurements. Similarly, the PDF uncertainties in their theoretical predictions, as given by Eq. (4), cancel to a large extent. This renders these observables well suited to determine the strong coupling constant. The data for | cos \u03c6| < 0.92 are fitted to the QCD predictions obtained with NLOJet++ to determine the value of the strong coupling constant.
