Final states with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least one jet are selected and categorized according to the accompanying jet multiplicity. From a likelihood fit to the invariant mass distribution of the isolated lepton and a jet identified as coming from the hadronization of a bottom quark, the cross section is measured to be \u03c3 tt = 888 \u00b1 2, (stat) +26 \u221228 (syst) \u00b1 20 (lumi) pb, in agreement with the standard model prediction. Using the expected dependence of the cross section on the pole mass of the top quark (m t ), the value of m t is found to be 170.6 \u00b1 2.7 GeV.",

            "text": "The rate at which top quark-antiquark (tt) pairs are produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at LHC has been measured at center-of-mass energies of 7 [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14], 8 [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23], and 13 TeV [24][25][26]. The latter has been determined experimentally with a 4.4% uncertainty. In addition, several analyses have explored the expected dependence of the tt production cross section (\u03c3 tt ) on the mass of the top quark (m t ) to extract the latter. Recent examples of this can be found in ref. [23], where m t is determined with a total uncertainty of \u22481%. Alternatively, the strong coupling strength (\u03b1 S ) can be extracted from the tt cross section, assuming m t is known [27]. Knowledge of the parton distribution function (PDF) of the proton can be improved as well from a precise measurement of \u03c3 tt [28,29]. In addition, the production of final states via processes beyond the standard model that mimic the ones produced by tt decay can be revealed by a precise measurement of \u03c3 tt [30]. The above-mentioned interpretations of the measured \u03c3 tt provide a few examples, among others existing in the literature, that can benefit from such precision comparisons.",

The selected events are split into categories according to the total number of jets in the event and the number of jets identified as coming from the hadronization of a b quark. Each category uses observables that can discriminate the main backgrounds (multijet and W+jets production) from the tt signal.

In addition, reconstruction, identification, and calibration algorithms are employed for electrons and muons, as described in refs. [57,58]. The lepton candidates are required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1. Identification and isolation requirements are imposed to reject misidentified muons from punchthrough hadrons, photon conversion, and other objects misreconstructed as lepton candidates. These criteria are tighter than the ones imposed at trigger level. The tag-and-probe method measures the efficiency of these requirements, yielding typical efficiencies of 70% and 92% for electrons and muons, respectively. Nonprompt leptons that come from the decays of long-lived hadrons are rejected by requiring that the significance of the three-dimensional (3D) impact parameter of the lepton track, relative to the primary event vertex, is less than four standard deviations. This requirement effectively reduces the contamination from multijet events, while keeping a high efficiency for the signal. The expected efficiency of this requirement is cross-checked using Z \u2192 candidate events. The primary event vertex used as reference is required to -3 -JHEP09(2017)051 be reconstructed from at least four tracks, and have a longitudinal distance of less than 24 cm from the center of the detector.

Therefore, we further subdivide the four jet-multiplicity categories according to the number of reconstructed b-tagged jets, considering events with none, one, or at least two b-tagged jets, for a total of 11 orthogonal categories. Since the collision particles are protons, an asymmetric production of W bosons, with more W + produced than W \u2212 , is expected [65].

The contributions from backgrounds other than multijets are subtracted in the referred to isolated-lepton region, and the ratio of events observed in data in this region with respect to the number of events found in the nonisolated-lepton control region is assigned as the renormalization scale factor. Given the tight requirements on leptons, we expect bb +jets events to dominate the multijet contamination.

This reflects the loss of information in \u00b5 because of the presence of systematic uncertainties [74]. Although m t does not contribute an intrinsic uncertainty in the measurement of the cross section, since the M ( , b) distribution is used in the fit, its shape has a direct dependence on m t that needs to be taken into account. We thus include in the fit a parameterization of the effect of varying m t by \u00b13 GeV while measuring the cross section as the parameter of interest. This parameterization is performed for both the signal and JHEP09 (2017)051the single top quark simulations. With this procedure, the fit accomodates for a possibly different value of m t than that assumed by default in the simulation but witout correlating this with the pole mass to be extracted from the inclusive tt production rate, as originally proposed in ref. [75]. Figure 3 (left) shows the variation of the likelihood as a function of the signal strength from the data and the expected variation from the simulation. From the fit, we measure \u00b5 = 1.067 \u00b1 0.002 (stat) +0.037 \u22120.035 (syst). The tt cross section in the visible phase space is thus measured with a total uncertainty of 3.4%. As a check, the Monte Carlo simulated signal and background events corresponding to the same integrated luminosity as the data are used as pseudo-data with m t = 172.5 GeV in the fit. The resulting value of the signal strength is \u00b5 = 1.000 \u00b1 0.002 (stat) +0.035 \u22120.034 (syst).

By repeating the fits, the effect of some nuisance parameters being fixed may be reabsorbed by a variation of the ones being profiled, owing to correlations. Figure 4 summarizes the values obtained for the leading sources of uncertainty in the fit. The dominant sources of uncertainty in both analyses are related to the integrated luminosity, trigger and selection efficiencies, and the model of the W+jets background. These are expected to impact the signal strength at the level of 1-2.5% The analysis of the distributions is effectively able to mitigate most uncertainties related to the modeling of tt. The modeling of the top quark p T and the choice of the hadronizer are the dominant signal modeling uncertainties but their impact in the fit is observed to be <1%. Uncertainties related to the modeling of the multijets background are observed to impact the fit at the level of <0.5% None of the nuisance parameters used in the fit is observed to be significantly pulled from its initial value and its behavior is similar to that expected by performing the fit using simulated events with m t = 172.5 GeV. Nuisance parameters related to the integrated luminosity and the trigger and selection efficiencies are observed not to be constrained in the fit procedure.  The signal strength is measured in a region of phase space where the lepton has p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1, and at least one jet has p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.

(4.2)) is reparametrized, transforming \u00b5 into a functional form that depends on the top quark mass where the last factor (A/A(m t )), is a mass-dependent correction to the acceptance. Using simulated tt samples with different m t , we find that the acceptance changes by 0.08% per \u2206m t = 1 GeV. The uncertainty in the extrapolation, as well as the theoretical uncertainties that affect the parameterization as a function of m t coming from the choices of \u00b5 R /\u00b5 F , PDF, \u03b1 S , and beam energy, are added as extra nuisance parameters in the fit for the pole mass. With the exception of \u00b5 R /\u00b5 F , which is defined through a log-uniform probability distribution consistent with the procedure adopted in ref. [27], the remaining uncertainties are assigned a log-normal function. After repeating the maximum-likelihood fit, we obtain m t = 170.6 \u00b1 2.7 GeV, where the quoted uncertainty contains both statistical and systematic contributions. The result agrees with that obtained using the NNPDF3.0 NNLO PDF [28]: m t = 170.3 +2.6 \u22122.7 GeV. The latter is only used as a cross-check as the NNPDF3.0 PDF includes top-quark-related data in the determination of the proton PDFs. In both cases, the best-fit value is determined by fixing the nuisance parameter associated with the choice of the \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F ratio to its post-fit value, and repeating the scan of the likelihood. This procedure is adopted to resolve the almost degenerate behavior of the likelihood, induced through the use of a log-uniform pdf assigned to the choice of the \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F ratio. Figure 5 shows the variation of the likelihood as a function of the top quark pole mass. For comparison, the expected likelihood from the Asimov set of nuisance parameters at m t = 172.5 GeV is shown.",
