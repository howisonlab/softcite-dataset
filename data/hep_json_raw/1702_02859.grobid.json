They use 20.2 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC. Total, fiducial and differential cross-sections are measured for both top-quark and top-antiquark production. The fiducial crosssection is measured with a precision of 5.8% (top quark) and 7.8% (top antiquark), respectively. The total cross-sections are measured to be \u03c3 tot (tq) = 56.7 +4.3   \u22123.8 pb for top-quark production and \u03c3 tot (tq) = 32.9 +3.0 \u22122.7 pb for top-antiquark production, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. In addition, the ratio of top-quark to top-antiquark production cross-sections is determined to be R t = 1.72 \u00b1 0.09. The differential cross-sections as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of both the top quark and the top antiquark are measured at both the parton and particle levels. The transverse momentum and rapidity differential crosssections of the accompanying jet from the t-channel scattering are measured at particle level. All measurements are compared to various Monte Carlo predictions as well as to fixed-order QCD calculations where available.",

In leading-order (LO) perturbation theory, single top-quark production is described by three subprocesses that are distinguished by the virtuality of the exchanged W boson. The dominant process is the t-channel exchange depicted in Fig. 1, where a light quark from one of the colliding protons interacts with a b-quark from another proton by exchanging a virtual W boson (W * ). Since the valence u-quark density of the proton is about twice as high as the valence d-quark density, the production cross-section of single top quarks, \u03c3 (tq), is expected to be about twice as high as the cross-section of top-antiquark production, \u03c3 (tq). At LO, subdominant singletop-quark processes are the associated production of a W Fig. 1 Representative leading-order Feynman diagrams for a single top-quark production and b single top-antiquark production via the tchannel exchange of a virtual W * boson, including the decay of the top quark and top antiquark, respectively boson and a top quark (W t) and the s-channel production of tb. The t-channel and s-channel processes do not interfere even at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory and are thus well defined with that precision.",

The analysis is based on the full ATLAS dataset collected in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . Separate measurements of tq andtq production provide sensitivity to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the u-quark and the d-quark, exploiting the different initial states of the two processes as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, the cross-section ratio R t \u2261 \u03c3 (tq)/\u03c3 (tq) is measured, which has smaller systematic uncertainties than the individual cross-sections, because of partial cancellations of common uncertainties. Investigating R t also provides a way of searching for new-physics contributions in single top-quark (top-antiquark) production [1] and of elucidating the nature of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) if it were to be observed [2].",

            "text": "In general, measurements of single top-quark production provide insights into the properties of the W tb interaction. The cross-sections are proportional to the square of the coupling at the W tb production vertex. In the SM, the coupling is given by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb [3,4] multiplied by the universal electroweak coupling constant. All measurements presented in this paper are based on the assumption that the production and the decay of top quarks via W ts and W td vertices are suppressed due to the fact that the CKM matrix elements V ts and V td are much smaller than V tb . Potential new-physics contributions to the W tb vertex are parameterised by an additional left-handed form factor f LV [5], assumed to be real. In this approach the Lorentz structure is assumed to be the same as in the SM, that is vector-axial-vector (V \u2212 A). The inclusive cross-section \u03c3 (tq +tq) is determined as the sum of \u03c3 (tq) and \u03c3 (tq) and used to determine f LV \u2022|V tb |. Alternatively, the measurement of \u03c3 (tq +tq) can be used to constrain the b-quark PDF. The measurement of \u03c3 (tq +tq) is also sensitive to various models of new-physics phenomena [6], such as extra heavy quarks, gauge bosons, or scalar bosons. Studies of differential crosssections allow the modelling of the process to be probed in more detail and provide a more sensitive search for effects of new physics.",

The top-quark mass m t is assumed to be 172.5 GeV, the same value which is used for the samples of simulated events in this analysis. The central values quoted in Eqs. (1a)-(1c) are determined following the PDF4LHC prescription [16], which defines the central value as the midpoint of the uncertainty envelope of three PDF sets: MSTW2008 [17,18], CT10 NLO [19] and NNPDF 3.0 [20]. The uncertainty due to the PDFs and their \u03b1 S dependence is given by half of the width of the envelope defined by these PDFs and is added in quadrature to the scale uncertainty to obtain the total uncertainties quoted in Eqs. (1a)-(1c). The sensitivity of \u03c3 (tq) and \u03c3 (tq) to the PDFs has recently gained attention in the literature [21]. The scale uncertainties in the predictions are determined following a prescription referred to as independent restricted scale variations, in which the renormalisation scale (\u03bc r ) and the factorisation scale (\u03bc f ) are varied independently, considering the default choices \u03bc def r and \u03bc def f , half the default scales and two times the default scales. The combinations (0.5\u03bc def r , 2.0\u03bc def f ) and (2.0\u03bc def r , 0.5\u03bc def f ) are excluded, thus \"restricted variations\". The maximum deviations in the predicted cross-sections for the six probed variations define the uncertainty.",

The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward regions (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. Its bending power ranges from 2.0 to 7.5 Tm. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A three-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz.

Highp T electrons associated with the W -boson decay can be mimicked by hadronic jets reconstructed as electrons, electrons from the decay of heavy quarks, and photon conversions.

Isolation criteria are optimised to achieve a uniform selection efficiency of 90% as a function of \u03b7 clus and transverse energy, E T . The direction of the electron candidate is taken as that of the associated track. Electron candidates are isolated by imposing thresholds on the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of calorimeter energy deposits within a surrounding cone of size R = 0.2.

To facilitate the comparison between measurements and predictions, the top-quark objects have to closely correspond in both cases. While parton-level definitions of the top-quark are affected by ambiguities at NLO accuracy in calculations and incur related uncertainties, top-quark definitions based on stable particles in MC generators form a solid foundation. On the other hand, some calculations are only available at parton level. Following this logic, a topquark proxy called a pseudo top quark is defined [71], based on the particle-level objects given in Sect. 7.2. Variables calculated using the pseudo top quark are denoted byt, while the untagged jet is written as\u0135.",

The W boson is reconstructed from the charged lepton and the neutrino at particle level. The z component of the neutrino momentum, p z (\u03bd), is calculated using the W -boson mass as a constraint. If the resulting quadratic equation has two real solutions, the one with smallest absolute value of | p z (\u03bd)| is chosen. In case of complex solutions, which can occur due to the low E miss T resolution, a kinematic fit is performed that rescales the neutrino p x and p y such that the imaginary part vanishes and at the same time the transverse components of the neutrino momentum are kept as close as possible to the E miss T . There are two jets in the events considered and exactly one of the jets is required to be b-tagged. The pseudo top quark is then formed by adding the four-momenta of the W boson and the b-tagged jet.",

The reconstruction of top-quark-related kinematic variables, the ranking of input variables according to their discriminating power, and the training process of the NN follow closely the procedures used in previous ATLAS publications about t-channel single top-quark production [9,10]. The input variables used for the NN are determined by a study in which the expected uncertainties in the cross-section measurements are computed for different sets of variables. The procedure starts from an initial set of 17 variables used in previous analyses [9,10]. These variables are ranked based on the algorithm described in Ref. [9]. One variable after the other is removed from the network according to the ranking, starting with the lowest-ranked one, followed by the next-lowest-ranked one, and so forth. In each iteration step the full analysis is performed and the expected uncertainty of the measurement is determined. As a result of the study, it is found that the reduction from the set of six highest-ranking variables to a set of five highest-ranking variables leads to a significant increase in the uncertainty in the cross-sections. Finally, the seven highest-ranking input variables are chosen, in order to avoid sudden changes in the uncertainty due to statistical fluctua- Table 2 The seven input variables to the NN ordered by their discriminating power.

The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . An artificial neural network is used to separate signal from background. Total and fiducial cross-sections are measured for both top quark and top antiquark production. The fiducial cross-section is measured with a precision of 5.8% (top quark) and 7.8% (top antiquark), respectively. In addition, the cross-section ratio of top-quark to top-antiquark produc-  Requiring a high value of the neural-network discriminant leads to relatively pure t-channel samples, which are used to measure differential cross-sections for both tq and tq production. Differential cross-sections as a function of the transverse momentum and absolute value of the rapidity of the top quark, the top antiquark, as well as the accompanying jet from the t-channel scattering are measured at particle level. The measurements of cross-sections as a function of the accompanying-jet transverse momentum and absolute value of the rapidity extend previous results, which only measured top-quark and top-antiquark distributions. Differential cross-sections as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the top quark and top antiquark are also measured at parton level. All measurements are compared to different Monte Carlo predictions as well as to fixed-order QCD calculations where these are available. The SM predictions provide good descriptions of the data.

The uncertainties in the predictions include the uncertainty in the renormalisation and factorisation scales and the combined internal PDF and \u03b1 S uncertainty. Most predictions agree at the 1 \u03c3 level with the measured value; only the prediction based on ABM (5 flav.) [79] is about 2.5 \u03c3 above the measurement. The main differences of the ABM PDF set compared to the other sets are the treatment of the b-quark PDF and the value of \u03b1 S . 10.4 Estimation of top-quark mass dependence The t-channel cross-section results given above are obtained for a top-quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV. The dependence of the measured cross-sections on m t is estimated by repeating the measurement with different mass assumptions. The MC samples for all processes containing top quarks are reproduced for six different values of m t , namely 165, 167.5, 170, 175, 177.5 and 180 GeV. The samples comprise the tq and tq signal as well as the background samples for tt, W t, tb production. The dependences of the resulting cross-sections on m t are fitted with a first-order polynomial, for which the constant term is given by the central value at m t = 172.5 GeV \u03c3 (m t ) = \u03c3 (172.5 GeV) + a \u2022 m t [GeV],",
