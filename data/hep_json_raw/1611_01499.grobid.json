Even though the existence of dark matter is no longer controversial, the particle nature of dark matter has not been established so far. The class of particles best motivated theoretically are usually referred to as WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles [1,2,3]. The experimental signature of such particles can be searched for in production experiments at colliders and beam dumps, indirectly by looking for annihilation products from zones expected to have high dark matter densities, such as the galactic core, or by directly looking for interactions between ordinary matter and dark matter through the observation of nuclear recoils in large underground detectors.",

The low mass number also leads to a peak sensitivity in the low WIMP mass range of tens of GeV/c 2 , an area of much recent interest in dark matter experiments [16,17,18].

The explosive bubble nucleation is accompanied by an acoustic signal in the audible and ultrasonic frequency range and gives information on the nature of the underlying event [11,23,24].

The precise relation between energy threshold and operating temperature in C 4 F 10 was determined by extensive measurements of 19 F-recoils using mono-energetic neutron beams and with alpha emitters of known energies in the droplets [24,25,26]. Since each temperature corresponds to a defined energy threshold, the spectrum of the particle induced energy depositions can be reconstructed by varying the threshold temperature. A summary of the detector response to different kinds of particles is shown in Fig.1, where temperatures are converted into energy thresholds. For 19 F-recoils this energy scale corresponds directly to their detection thresholds. Since WIMP induced recoil energies of 19 F nuclei are expected to be smaller than 100 keV they become detectable above 30 0 C. At the normal operating thresholds of PICASSO above 1 keV, particles with low ionization densities, such as \u03b3 -rays and \u03b2 -particles do not deposit sufficient energy to induce a phase change and these events are suppressed by more than a factor of 10 \u22129 . Only alpha particles and neutrons can contribute particle induced backgrounds to the WIMP searches in this detector. The described responses depend exclusively on the thermodynamic parameters describing the degree of superheat of the droplet fluid and are independent of detector specific parameters (i.e. droplet size, loading fraction, transducer response).",

Being limited essentially by the alpha background in the gel components, continuous efforts were made to revise and improve the purification procedures and to replace higher rate modules with cleaner ones (Section 5). Data taking with the upgraded set of 32 detector modules started in March 2012 and concluded in January 2014 with a total exposure of 231.4 kgd, after applying fiducial volume and timing cuts (Section 6).

The selected droplet size was found to maximize the amount of active fluid in the detectors. Much larger droplets would tend to imperil the structural integrity of the surrounding polymer during bubble formation in the gel; smaller droplets would increase the geometric efficiency for detection of alpha particles originating from the gel. Calibrations showed that the observed particle response was independent of the droplet size within the range considered and conformed to the response observed in bulk superheated liquids.

This shielding and setup represented a significant reduction in the background activity due to neutrons compared to the underground shielding used for previous PICASSO data sets. At the SNOLAB facility almost all neutrons are produced via (\u03b1, n) reactions due to natural U/Th radioactivity in the rock, with a remaining 10% from fission. A production rate of 4.0 neutrons g \u22121 y \u22121 was found from the relative abundance of isotopes in the surrounding Norite rock by computations using the SOURCES code [29,30]. These neutrons were further propagated by a GEANT4 simulation through the rock, the cavern and the water shielding to the detector location [31,32]. The performance of the simulation and the effectiveness of the shielding were checked by measurements with several 3 He counters (SNO NCDs [33]) which were surrounded by various thicknesses of dedicated polyethylene neutron moderator [29]. Measurements and simulations with and without water shielding showed that 99.66 \u00b1 0.01 % of the incoming neutrons with energies above 5 keV were stopped in the shielding. Using the estimate of the fast neutron flux underground of (4 \u00b1 2)\u00d7 10 3 neutrons m \u22122 d \u22121 in the cavern [34] and an average sensitivity of PICASSO detectors to neutrons of 0.1 cts per neutron g \u22121 cm \u22122 [26], the expected event rate induced by fast neutrons was determined to 0.14 cts kg \u22121 d \u22121 .

In addition, the amplitude distributions of the high frequency content (> 20 kHz) of the particle induced wave forms were concentrated in a well-defined peak. Tests on different known droplet samples showed that the amplitudes of particle induced events were not droplet size dependent, which is consistent with the current model of particle -induced sound generation in superheated liquids described in [24]. These features and others were used to construct variables which allowed the discrimination of particle induced events from non-particle background events. Since all event selection variables were dependent on the detector module and the operating temperature, a set of variables and cut values were calculated using neutron calibration data averaged over all piezoelectric transducers. The cut values were determined by plotting the variable's distribution obtained in neutron calibrations and setting the cuts to retain 95% of neutrons. The values obtained were then fit with a polynomial to interpolate to all operating temperatures.The following are the main variables for event discrimination:",

First an event time for each piezoelectric sensor was found on raw and 18 kHz high-pass filtered signals from each piezoelectric sensor. Two methods were developed to find the event time: a comparison between two moving signal averages, averaged over 10 \u00b5s and 45 \u00b5s, respectively, and a cumulative shape indicator, where the cumulative time weighted average amplitude was compared with a uniform time integral to find the greatest separation, and hence the most likely signal start time. These arrival times were fit using a multi-parameter fit to obtain the localization point separately, giving four measurements of the bubble position.

The same measurements were used for a direct determination of the speed of sound in the emulsion. These measurements were complemented by calibration data in 12 detectors at temperatures from 30 0 C to 40 0 C and where the speed was added as an additional fit parameter. The measured mean value v s = 1507 \u00b1 141 m/s at 40 0 C agrees within uncertainties with the speed of sound in water v s = 1528.88 m/s which constitutes 78% of the total mass of the detector.",

Starting with a central volume of 5 cm radius and \u00b1 8 cm in height, the count rate (in cts/gh) within this core volume was taken as a reference. Next, the active volume was gradually increased, as long as the count rate remained within one sigma of the core value, and this for all temperatures. An example is given in Fig. 2 which shows the vertical profile of the count rate in one of the \"hot-spike\"detector modules (# 145). For these modules a tighter fiducial cut was implemented, reducing the background rate substantially. The event localization and wavelet analyses were also particularly useful for the discrimination of so called \" mystery events\": for high temperature runs above 45 0 C (i.e. low recoil threshold) a new type of background was observed in the data especially for seven detectors with decreased intrinsic alpha-background (< 10 cts kg \u22121 d \u22121 ). This background was characterized by an increasingly large rate at high temperatures, similar in profile to a WIMP signal or neutron background. However, this background was not found in all detectors and when it was present had inconsistent and varying rates between modules. Data at 50 0 C particularly exhibited this class of background events. By localizing the events it was noticed that they were concentrated at the edges of the detectors (both along the walls and at the top and bottom of the acrylic container). The most probable cause of these events are shear and stress effects at and in the vicinity of the emulsion interfaces. A typical fiducial cut of r < 6 cm around the center of the detector, together with the wavelet analysis, was able to remove the mystery events altogether. This allowed the inclusion of the 1 keV threshold data for the first time. The active mass contained within the restricted fiducial volume was measured using the AmBe calibration source runs, and it was found that each detector had its fiducial mass reduced by this radial cut by about 30%.",

The count rates of all detectors showed a flat plateau in the range from 1.05 to 40 keV (50 -28 0 C), similar to that observed in the presence of \u03b1 -emitters ( Fig. 1) in the droplets. The count rates averaged over the plateau range are shown in Fig. 3   The progressive reduction in background was achieved by adding a 0.2 \u00b5m filtration stage for the monomer solution, by additional purification of the polymerizing agent (TEMED) and, for detectors 150 onward, by a doubling of all purification steps. In addition cover gas from LN 2 boil-off was used during all operations to mitigate radon diffusion from ambient air into the emulsion ingredients. This latter measure had no detectable effect on the detection sensitivity and threshold. The origin of the residual \u03b1 -background is uncertain, but the acoustic signature of the events suggested that the activity was located primarily within the droplets. Detector 164 had the lowest background rate equivalent to a contamination level of 5\u00d710 \u221212 gU g \u22121 in the C 4 F 10 droplets. In order to combine the data of all detectors for illustrative purposes in a single plot, we adopted the following procedure: for each detector the average count rate was calculated over the temperature range from 30 0 C to 35 0 C where WIMPS with masses M W < 15 GeV/c 2 do marginally contribute; this count rate was taken as an approximation of the \u03b1 -background level of the detector and was subtracted from individual data points at different temperatures; the data for each detector and temperature were then combined in a weighted average; and finally, the temperatures were converted into threshold energies by taking into account that due to the somewhat elevated mine pressure (1.2 bar) the measured temperature at the location of the experiment corresponded to a threshold with a temperature at surface (where the calibration was performed), reduced by 2 0 C. The threshold dependence on pressure for a given temperature was measured by PICASSO with monoenergetic neutron test beams and is reported in [26].",

For a given mass M W the two parameters of the fit are the cross section \u03c3 F and a scale factor describing the constant \u03b1-background. As an example, the result for each detector is shown in Fig. 5 for a WIMP mass of M W = 10 GeV/c 2 , the mass region of highest sensitivity.

Indirect searches are represented by Ice-Cube (dashed dark green [39]), SuperK (dashed orange [40,41]) with comparable limits by ANTARES, Baikal and Baksan [42,43,44]. Limits from accelerator searches by CMS are shown in dashed light orange [45]. Comparable limits are set by ATLAS [46]. The purple region represents predictions in the framework of the CMSSM [47].",

The result for \u03c3 F is then converted with Eq. 3 into a cross section on protons of \u03c3 SD p = (1.39 \u00b1 8.46 \u00b1 0.72)\u00d710 \u22123 pb (1\u03c3; a = 5), yielding a best limit of \u03c3 p SD = 1.53\u00d710 \u22122 pb (90% C.L.) for WIMP masses around 20 GeV/c 2 . Adding the 114 kgd exposure of our 2012 data improves this limit slightly to \u03c3 SD p = 1.32\u00d710 \u22122 pb (90% C.L.) The resulting exclusion curve for the WIMP cross section on protons as a function of WIMP mass is shown in Fig. 6 together with published results in the spin-dependent sector. The broadening of the exclusion curve shows the effect of varying the energy resolution parameter a within its uncertainty.  Figure 7: Upper limits at 90% C.L. in the spin-independent sector.

            "text": "PICASSO has operated a system of 32 superheated droplet detectors at SNOLAB with a combined exposure of 345.4 kgd. No indication of a WIMP signal was observed and a spin-dependent limit of 1.32\u00d710 \u22122 pb at M W = 20 GeV/c 2 was set at a 90% confidence limit. In the spin-independent sector around 7 GeV/c 2 , and close to the CoGeNT allowed region [17], a limit of 4.9\u00d710 \u22125 pb (90% C.L.) was extracted from the data. The use of the light target nucleus 19 F, combined with an increased exposure at the low detection threshold of 1 keV resulted in increased leverage in the low WIMP mass region. The main improvements with respect to our previous published results are: a substantial reduction in intrinsic \u03b1-background by up to a factor 10 in some modules and localization of events by acoustic triangulation.",

The technique is easily scalable to multiple detectors; however the filling factor is only a few percent, the amount of surface area per active volume is much larger than in any other configuration of superheated liquid detectors and non-particle induced backgrounds start to become difficult to control in larger scale experiments. In addition the event by event \u03b1-recoil discrimination using the acoustic signal energy discovered by PICASSO can be much easier applied in bulk superheated liquids.",

This would not have been achievable with the existing purification technology for the components of the detector gel matrix. With this powerful acoustic discrimination tool the PICASSO group is now focused on large scale superheated fluorinated halocarbons for dark matter detection using the more traditional bubble chamber technique as part of the broader PICO collaboration [9,10].",
