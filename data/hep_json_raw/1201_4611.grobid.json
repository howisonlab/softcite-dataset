However, in this production mode, the detection of the H \u2192 bb decay is rendered nearly impossible due to overwhelming QCD di-jet production. The same holds true for the next most copious production mode, through vector-boson fusion, with a cross section of \u223c 1, 300 fb. Instead we consider processes in which the Higgs is produced in association with a vector boson which have cross sections of \u223c 660 and \u223c 360 fb for WH and ZH respectively. Even if the resulting sensitivity of the H \u2192 bb decay is less than other final states such as H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 for example, it is paramount to search for the Higgs in these modes given that the observation of the H \u2192 bb decay is key to determine the nature of this particle, if and when discovered.",
