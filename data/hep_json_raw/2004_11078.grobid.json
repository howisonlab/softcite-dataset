            "text": "We report on the measurement of the Central Exclusive Production of charged particle pairs h + h \u2212 (h = \u03c0, K, p) with the STAR detector at RHIC in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV. The charged particle pairs produced in the reaction pp \u2192 p + h + h \u2212 + p are reconstructed from the tracks in the central detector and identified using the specific energy loss and the time of flight method, while the forward-scattered protons are measured in the Roman Pot system. Exclusivity of the event is guaranteed by requiring the transverse momentum balance of all four final-state particles. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of observables related to the central hadronic final state and to the forward-scattered protons. They are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the acceptance of the STAR detector and determined by the central particles' transverse momenta and pseudorapidities as well as by the forward-scattered protons' momenta. This fiducial region roughly corresponds to the square of the four-momentum transfers at the proton vertices in the range 0.04 GeV 2 < \u2212t 1 , \u2212t 2 < 0.2 GeV 2 , invariant masses of the charged particle pairs up to a few GeV and pseudorapidities of the centrallyproduced hadrons in the range |\u03b7| < 0.7. The measured cross sections are compared to phenomenological predictions based on the Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE) model. Structures observed in the mass spectra of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 pairs are consistent with the DPE model, while angular distributions of pions suggest a dominant spin-0 contribution to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production. For \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production, the fiducial cross section is extrapolated to the Lorentz-invariant region, which allows decomposition of the invariant mass spectrum into continuum and resonant contributions. The extrapolated cross section is well described Open Access, c The Authors. Article funded by SCOAP 3 .",

            "text": "The study of exclusive production of meson and baryon pairs has long been recognised as an important ground for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) tests. Exclusive production of pion and kaon pairs has been studied both theoretically [1][2][3] and experimentally, in two-photon collisions at lepton colliders [4][5][6][7] and via photoproduction [8][9][10][11] and deep inelastic scattering [12,13] in lepton-proton and heavy-ion experiments. Exclusive production of meson and baryon pairs belongs to the class of Central Exclusive Production (CEP) processes. In hadron-hadron collisions, CEP processes can proceed via Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE), photon-Pomeron exchange or photon-photon exchange, where the Pomeron is a colour-singlet object with internal quantum numbers of the vacuum, see,",

This process in the DPE mode and with the hadronic final state, X, consisting of just an oppositely-charged particle pair is schematically shown in figure 1(left). In figure 1(right), its representation within perturbative QCD (pQCD) is shown in the two-gluon approximation. The scattered protons emerge intact from the collision at small polar angles with respect to the incoming beams and can be detected with special tagging devices. The final state, X, can be fully measured at central rapidities. The upper limit of the invariant mass, M X , of the system X depends on the energy of the colliding particles. At the LHC, this upper limit can reach above 100 GeV and the central production of even the Higgs or supersymmetric particles might be possible [20]. Recently, CEP of pion pairs in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV has been reported by the CMS experiment [21,22]. The LHCb experiment has measured photo-induced CEP of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) states in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV [23] and \u03a5(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) states in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [24]. At the Tevatron, it was possible to study CEP of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs with invariant masses up to a few GeV in pp collisions at several centre-of-mass energies up to \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [17,25]. The above measurements were performed without forward-proton tagging. The experiments at CERN at the ISR [26] and the SPS [27] have provided measurements of many CEP processes with forward proton tagging, however at significantly smaller centre-of-mass energies (62 GeV for ISR and 30 GeV for SPS).",

Contributions from photon-Pomeron and photon-photon processes are also not significant and are additionally suppressed at \u2212t > 0.04 GeV 2 . Therefore, the DPE process is expected to be dominant. The DPE process can be regarded as a spin and parity filter, i.e., the h + h \u2212 system must have even spin and positive parity, so only exclusive production of f 0 and f 2 resonances are allowed on top of the continuum in the studied h + h \u2212 production. In general, the resonance and continuum contributions may interfere. Calculations of the hadron mass spectrum in this domain were first done for only the continuum production [18,28,29] of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or K + K \u2212 pairs using an approach based on Regge theory. In these models, the parameters of the Pomeron and sub-leading Reggeon exchanges were adjusted to describe the total and elastic \u03c0p or Kp scatterings. In this approach, the amplitude for the p + p \u2192 p + \u03c0\u03c0(KK) + p process is expressed in terms of the product of two amplitudes describing the interaction of each of the two protons with one of the two mesons. The intermediate meson form factor is parameterised with one of three functions: an exponential, exp (t \u2212 m 2 h )/\u039b 2 off , an Orear-like function, exp \u2212b( \u221a \u2212t + m 2 h + a 2 \u2212 a) , or a power-like function, 1/(1 \u2212 (t \u2212 m 2 h )/a 0 ), wheret is the square of the four momentum transfer at the Pomeron-meson vertex and \u039b 2 off , b, a and a 0 are free parameters. The models can be supplemented to include absorption effects (shown symbolically on figure 1) which are needed to calculate the 'survival probability' for no additional soft re-scatterings between the colliding protons or the final state mesons. Absorption corrections are related to the non-perturbative interaction in the initial or final state of the reaction. The re-scattering leads to suppression of the cross section and distortion of the distributions of the kinematic variables. The suppression factor depends on the collision energy. They usually reduce the cross sections, even by a factor of 5 at RHIC energy and a factor of 10 at LHC energies [30]. Recently, the production of a variety of resonances: the f 0 (500), f 0 (980) and f 2 (1270) decaying to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the f 0 (980), f 0 (1500), f 0 (1710), f 2 (1270)",

Silicon strip detectors are located in two stations on each side of the interaction point (IP) at distances of 15.8 m and 17.6 m, respectively. Each station has two RPs, one placed above and one below the beam-line, see figure 2 (bottom). The RPs are situated downstream of the DX dipole magnets responsible for head-on targeting of the incoming beams and for bending outgoing beams back into the respective accelerator pipelines. The constant and uniform magnetic field of the DX magnet works as a spectrometer, and thus knowledge of the scattered proton's trajectory allows reconstruction of its momentum. Each RP houses a package of 4 silicon strip detector planes -two with vertical and two with horizontal orientation of the strips -allowing measurement of the position of a proton in the transverse plane. The strip pitch is about 100 \u00b5m, resulting in a spatial resolution of about 30 \u00b5m. Scintillator counters placed inside each RP station allow for triggering on forward protons and also provide timing information with 0.5 ns resolution. Measurement of a pair of charged particles produced in the final state at central rapidity is performed using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [45], which provides tracking for charged particles in the 0.5 Tesla solenoidal magnetic field. The TPC covers the pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 1.8 in full azimuthal angle. 1 The TPC is used to determine the momenta of the charged particles, and also helps in locating the position of the collision vertex. The tracking efficiency is \u223c 85% for |\u03b7| < 1, but falls to 50% at |\u03b7| \u223c 1.3. The measurement of the specific energy loss in the TPC gas, dE/dx, is used for particle identification. Furthermore, to extend the particle identification power of the STAR",

Pairs of matched clusters found in detector planes measuring the same coordinate define the (x, y) coordinates of space points for a given RP. Correlating space points between RP stations, and reconstructing the proton kinematics, relies on an alignment procedure, which is carried out using elastic scattering data for each run separately, as described in ref. [50]. A track is formed based on one or two points reconstructed in the two RP detector stations on the same side of the IP. Using elastic scattering events reconstructed with tracks formed from the two points, the average transverse position of the primary vertex was measured to be x IP = 0.42 \u00b1 0.04 mm and y IP = 0.46 \u00b1 0.05 mm. With the average transverse position of the vertex and two-point proton tracks, the proton transverse momentum (p x , p y ) can be reconstructed, and hence the value of the Mandelstam variable t. For single point proton tracks, the transverse momentum is reconstructed assuming that the scattered proton energy is equal to the beam energy. Such an approximation is justified because the proton loses on average less than 1% of its initial energy for events with M X < 2 GeV.",

A larger value of \u039b 2 off was used [18] to fit DiMe predictions to ISR data, however the 50% normalisation uncertainty of the ISR data does not exclude \u039b 2 off = 1.0 GeV 2 . In GenEx, the absorption corrections are not taken into account. However, the model developers estimated the suppression factor to be of the order of 2-5 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and 2 (K + K \u2212 ) [30]. To account for absorption, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross sections obtained from GenEx are scaled by 0.25 to fit DiMe predictions for masses above 0.8 GeV, while the K + K \u2212 cross sections from GenEx are scaled by 0.45 to fit DiMe predictions for masses above 1.2 GeV. Above these limits, the absorption effects only weakly depend on pair mass. In the GenEx generator, we also use an exponential form for the meson form factor using \u039b 2 off = 1.0 GeV 2 . Therefore the differences between GenEx and DiMe are almost entirely due to the absorption effects.",

All the above sources of background are estimated using a data-driven method. Both undetected particles in 'single source' events and the random character of 'pile-up' events lead to breaking the correlation between the central h + h \u2212 pair and the forward protons and to a much flatter p miss T distribution. This can be seen in figure 5 (left column), where the p miss T distribution starts to increase above 100 MeV. Background estimation is based on the extrapolation into the signal region of the second-degree polynomial function fitted to the signal-free region, as shown by the magenta histograms. The polynomial is constrained in the fit to vanish at p miss T = 0. This procedure is repeated differentially for all the kinematic variables presented later. As an example, the resulting background estimation is presented in figure 5 (right column) differentially in m(h + h \u2212 ) by the magenta histograms. The shape of the background as a function of p miss T is confirmed by MC predictions and like-sign events (shown by red points), which are, by definition, background.

Particles passing through the detector material lose some energy. To minimise biases from this effect, a correction procedure is applied during track-momentum reconstruction for both data and MC simulation based on the expected material budget for the given track. In this procedure, all tracks are assumed to be pions, therefore the reconstructed momenta of the remaining particle species exhibit some bias. For tracks identified as kaons and JHEP07(2020)178 protons, an additional energy loss correction was applied based on the single particle MC. The correction is up to 10 and 20 MeV for low-momentum kaons and protons, respectively. Several corrections were implemented to account for the limited efficiency of the measurement. The RP and TOF trigger efficiencies were estimated from the unbiased data to be \u223c 100% and 98%, respectively. The RP trigger efficiency was evaluated as the probability that the trigger was set when a proton was reconstructed in the given station. For events with exactly two TPC tracks, each matched with hits in the TOF and originating from a common vertex, and at most one additional TOF hit, the TOF trigger efficiency was estimated as the fraction of events that passed the TOF trigger conditions. The average number of inelastic collisions per bunch crossing varies between 0.2 and 0.9 and leads to a sizeable probability that the exclusive signal overlaps with another process, which causes signal loss due to the trigger or offline selections. This probability is estimated based on zero-bias data for each run independently and parameterised as a function of instantaneous luminosity for each of the four possible combinations of RPs topology. An event is rejected if the overlapping process produces a signal in the BBC, ZDC, TOF, or the RP station not belonging to the studied combination, since our selection criteria include vetos on these detectors. The overall veto efficiency varies between 40-80%. The efficiency of the |z vtx | < 80 cm selection cut was estimated for each RHIC fill independently based on the estimated values of the mean and standard deviation, assuming a normal distribution in the data.

The same sample was used to study the proton reconstruction efficiency. Secondaries produced in the dead material or from 'pile-up' processes introduce inefficiencies in the reconstruction procedure. This inefficiency was also calculated using a data-driven tag-and-probe method using elastic scattering data, where one of the protons serves as a tag to probe the reconstruction efficiency of the second proton.

TPC inefficiencies are caused by empty spaces between the sectors, fiducial cuts on the positions of space points, the influence of a high density of off-time tracks, the interactions of particles in dead material in front of the TPC, dead TPC modules, and natural decays of pions and kaons before or inside the TPC.

Above 1 GeV, the efficiency plateaus at 80% for pions, 70% for kaons and 85% for protons. The efficiency is roughly independent of particle charge, except that the efficiency for anti-protons is around 2% smaller than for protons. The TPC efficiencies depend on the track selection criteria.

For high statistics exclusive \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production, the TOF efficiency was also measured using a data-driven tag-and-probe method where one of the pions matched with the TOF serves as a tag and the efficiency of the TOF was measured for the second pion.

For m(\u03c0\u03c0) (figure 7 (right)), the background contributions using the nominal and alternative methods disagree by up to 50% depending on the mass region. The enhancement of the data-driven estimate over the MC prediction around the f 2 (1270) and \u03c1 0 mass regions may be caused by imperfect modelling of the resonant states in the hadronisation model used in the PYTHIA generator. This discrepancy was not used as a systematic uncertainty on the background estimation. The third possible method for background estimation is another data-driven method using the same-sign control sample normalised to the opposite-sign sample in the signal-free region of p miss T > 0.15 GeV. The unscaled same-sign contribution is shown by red circles in figures 6 and 7, while the distributions predicted by PYTHIA 8 CD are shown by the blue hatched histogram.

Sharp drops in the measured cross sections at m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) < 0.6 GeV and at m(K + K \u2212 ) < 1.3 GeV for the \u2206\u03d5 > 90 \u2022 range are due to the fiducial cuts applied to the forward-scattered protons. In the case of the cross section for CEP of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs in the \u2206\u03d5 < 90 \u2022 range, the peak around the f 2 (1270) resonance in data is significantly suppressed while the peak at f 0 (980), as well as possible resonances in the mass ranges 1.3-1.5 GeV and 2.2-2.3 GeV, is enhanced compared to the \u2206\u03d5 > 90 \u2022 range. Such correlations, between resonances observed in the mass spectrum and in azimuthal angle between outgoing protons, indicate factorisation breaking between the two proton vertices. In the range \u2206\u03d5 < 90 \u2022 , the DiMe model describes well both the normalisation and the shape of the mass spectrum at m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) < 0.5 GeV.

Extrapolation to an unmeasured region is always model dependent. In this section, we present the cross section corrected to the full phase space using a flat angular approximation which distributes scalar decays uniformly over the solid angle in the rest frame of the central system. This choice is supported by the generally good description of the pion angular distribution by the S 0 wave distribution shown in figure 16, and by the expected dominant production of 0-spin states. However, other scenarios are also considered. To limit the corrections, the measurement is restricted to |y(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )| < 0.4. This keeps scalar decays uniform, by Lorentz invariance. In the correction calculation, the factorisation of the phase space of the central system and forward protons is assumed. For the forward protons' phase space, a uniform distribution of azimuthal angles is assumed, while polar angles are generated according to an exponential t distribution with t-slope of 6 GeV \u22122 .

We check the effect of the extrapolation to the full solid angle in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 rest frame, assuming a smooth transition from the angular distributions for pure S 0 -wave (up to 1 GeV) to the angular distributions for pure D 0 -wave (starting at 1.2 GeV).

We also check the result of the fit with the ratio g K /g \u03c0 varied within its uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty on a parameter is separated into two parts. The first one is related to the experimental uncertainties and is calculated as the quadratic sum of the differences between the nominal fit result and the result of the fit to d\u03c3/dm(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) with each systematic effect.

Alternative extrapolation models show a similar fit quality, although some parameters change significantly as can be noted from the model-related uncertainties in table 3. The fitted model shows a small deviation from the extrapolated data around 1.37 GeV. This might result from the presence of the f 0 (1370), however the inclusion of the f 0 (1370) is not necessary to describe the data. The cross section for f 0 (1500) production differs from zero by 5 and 2 standard deviations in the \u2206\u03d5 < 45 \u2022 and \u2206\u03d5 > 135 \u2022 regions, respectively. Removing the f 0 (1500) from the fit makes the \u03c7 2 /ndf change to 352/186, a 7.0 standard-deviation effect. From this, we infer that the shape of d\u03c3/dm(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) around 1.4-1.6 GeV, the high-mass part of the f 2 (1270) region, is primarily determined by the f 0 (1500) interfering with \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 continuum.",

This is a consequence of the uniform \u03d5 distribution in all the models and the rather weak dependence of the cross section on \u2206\u03d5 within the measured ranges. Such approximations are well-founded and in good agreement with the data. Variations of the slope, \u03b2, with m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and \u2206\u03d5 can give important constraints for model developers. For example, it was pointed out in ref. [33] that the f 2 (1270) cross section may show an enhancement when t 1 \u2192 0 and t 2 \u2192 0 for some couplings, while for others a suppression is expected. This enhancement or suppression results in a larger or smaller value of \u03b2, respectively.",

The centreof-mass energy of pp collisions in the present measurement is three times larger than the previous highest-energy measurement of the DPE process with forward-proton tagging performed at CERN at the ISR in the AFS experiment [26]. The uncertainty of the absolute normalisation of the STAR measurement is a factor of four better compared to measurements at the ISR, giving much stronger constraints for phenomenological models. The fits JHEP07(2020)178 than the mass spectra show generally good agreement between the data and predictions, especially for DiMe. GenEx predicts shapes slightly different from the data for the \u2206\u03d5, cos(\u03b8 CS ) and y(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distributions.

This allows us to fit the extrapolated differential cross section with a minimal model of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass spectrum consisting of f 0 (980), f 2 (1270) and f 0 (1500) resonances and direct non-resonant \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production. The masses and widths of the f 0 (980) and f 0 (1500) resonances obtained from the fit are in good agreement with the PDG values. The two scalar mesons, f 0 (980) and f 0 (1500), are predominantly produced at \u2206\u03d5 < 45 \u2022 , whereas the tensor meson f 2 (1270) is predominantly produced at \u2206\u03d5 > 135 \u2022 . We observed weak evidence for an additional resonant state with a mass of 1372 \u00b1 13(stat.) MeV and a width of 44 \u00b1 24(stat.) MeV. This mass agrees with that of the f 0 (1370), but the width is much narrower than the PDG value of 200-500 MeV. The extrapolated cross sections of continuum production within the mass range 0.6 GeV < m < 1.7 GeV show an expected \u2206\u03d5 asymmetry caused by absorption. Fits to an exponential function of the form \u221d exp [\u03b2t 1 ] exp [\u03b2t 2 ] were performed on the differential cross sections d 2 \u03c3/dt 1 dt 2 to extract the slope of the \u2212t distributions. Variations in the slope with m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and \u2206\u03d5 can give important constraints for construction of phenomenological models of CEP of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs.",
