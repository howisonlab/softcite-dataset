The search is based on pp collision data taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Three high-transverse-momentum electrons or muons are selected, with two of them required to be consistent with originating from a Z boson decay. No significant excess above Standard Model background predictions is observed, and 95% confidence level limits on the production cross section of high-mass trilepton resonances are derived. The results are interpreted in the context of vector-like lepton and type-III seesaw models. For the vector-like lepton model, most heavy lepton mass values in the range 114-176 GeV are excluded. For the type-III seesaw model, most mass values in the range 100-468 GeV are excluded.",

Vector-like leptons (VLL) are invoked to explain the mass hierarchy between the different lepton generations [10]. They also arise in composite Higgs models [11,12] and models of warped extra dimensions [13,14]. Such leptons have masses much larger than those of the SM leptons, and are defined as colourless, spin-1/2 fermions whose leftand right-handed chiral components have the same transformation properties under the weak-isospin SU(2) gauge group. Another set of models predicting trilepton resonances is based on the type-III seesaw mechanism [15], which explains the origin of small neutrino masses through the introduction of heavy SU(2) triplets with zero hypercharge.",

This search uses data events with at least three charged leptons (electrons or muons), two of which are consistent with originating from a Z-boson decay. Several signal regions are defined to be sensitive to the pair-production of heavy leptons that decay to SM leptons and W , Z, or H bosons. The backgrounds, dominated by SM diboson production, are estimated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and control regions in data, and the predictions are validated in dedicated data samples.",

In the type-III seesaw model, the masses of the three heavy leptons are assumed to be identical. Feynman diagrams of the production and decay of the heavy leptons in both models are shown in figure 1. The heavy leptons are produced in pairs through Drell-Yan processes, with cross sections of roughly 34 fb and 844 fb for the VLL and type-III seesaw models, respectively, assuming heavy lepton masses of 200 GeV. The difference in the production cross section is due to the different gauge couplings of the models, as well as the additional neutral fermion in the type-III seesaw model. The heavy leptons decay via the mixing terms into an SM lepton and a W , Z, or H boson. The charged states L \u00b1 exist in both models, and have decay modes to W \u03bd, Z , and H ; the neutral state N 0 is only present in the type-III seesaw model, and decays to W , Z\u03bd, and H\u03bd. The charged lepton branching fractions approach B(L \u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u03bd) = 50%, B(L \u00b1 \u2192 Z \u00b1 ) = 25% and B(L \u00b1 \u2192 H \u00b1 ) = 25% for m L \u00b1 m H , in accordance with the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem [18]; at lower masses, the branching fractions to H and Z decrease as they become kinematically disfavoured. For the neutral lepton, the branching fractions to W , Z\u03bd, and H\u03bd are identical to those of the charged leptons to W \u03bd, Z , and H , respectively. Searches for heavy leptons were previously performed at LEP, excluding vector-like leptons with masses below m L \u00b1 = 101.2 GeV using the L \u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u03bd decay mode [19]. A search for type-III seesaw heavy leptons was performed by CMS in pp collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, using non-resonant trilepton signatures to exclude seesaw fermions with masses below m L \u00b1 = 180-200 GeV, depending on the branching fractions assumed [20].",

            "text": "Standard Model processes containing three or more lepton candidates can be classified into two categories. The first category consists of events with three prompt leptons produced in the decays of electroweak gauge bosons, which are estimated using the simulated samples described above. The second consists of events where at least one reconstructed lepton arises from a misidentified jet, hadron decay, or photon conversion, and is referred to as reducible background. For muons, reducible backgrounds arise from semileptonic b-or chadron decays and from in-flight decays of pions or kaons. Reducible electron backgrounds can arise from semi-leptonic b-or c-hadron decays, photon conversions and misidentified hadrons or jets. Drell-Yan production of a lepton pair with an associated photon that converts in the detector and is reconstructed as an isolated lepton (Z + \u03b3) is estimated using simulation. The remainder of the reducible background is estimated by scaling control samples in data, following a method similar to that described in ref. [46]. The control samples consist of events with one or more leptons that do not satisfy the nominal selection criteria, but instead satisfy a set of relaxed criteria, defined separately for each lepton flavour. The events are weighted with scale factors computed for each such lepton, defined as the ratio of misidentified or non-prompt lepton candidates that satisfy the nominal criteria to those which only fulfil the relaxed criteria. For electrons, the identification requirement is changed from tight to loose [22]. For muons, the requirements on the lepton isolation and on |d 0 /\u03c3  ",

The search is based on pp collision data taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are selected requiring at least three electrons or muons with high transverse momentum, with two of the leptons consistent with the decay of a Z boson. The events are categorized based on the presence or absence of additional leptons or dijet pairs in the event consistent with the decay products of a second heavy lepton, and separated into channels based on the flavour of the lepton associated with the Z boson to form a heavy lepton decay candidate. Using the difference between the trilepton and the Z boson JHEP09(2015)108 candidate masses, a search for a narrow resonance is performed in each of these categories using a maximum-likelihood fit of parameterized signal and background shapes to the data. No significant excess above Standard Model predictions is observed, and 95% CL limits on the production of trilepton resonances beyond the Standard Model are derived. The results are interpreted in the context of two models of new heavy leptons decaying to three charged leptons. In the vector-like lepton model, new heavy charged leptons are excluded in the mass range 129-176 GeV (114-168 GeV) for electron-only (muon-only) mixing, except for the interval 144-163 GeV (153-160 GeV). In the type-III seesaw model, the corresponding exclusion is in the mass range 100-430 GeV (100-468 GeV) for electron-only (muon-only) mixing, except for the interval 401-419 GeV in the muon case. Limits are also set on the visible cross section of trilepton resonance productions, and fiducial efficiencies are derived to facilitate model testing.",
