These processes are very significant in their own right, to better understand QCD in the non-perturbative regime, and they form a large fraction of the total cross section. In addition, they are valuable because of their intimate connection to the rapidity gap survival factor\u015c 2 , which determines the rate of suppression of the central exclusive processes caused by rescattering effects (including additional parton interactions). Such processes have a number of unique advantages for studying QCD and new physics, and in particular for detailed probing of the Higgs boson properties [1,2].",

There has not been much improvement in the theoretical understanding of the high energy behaviour of the strong interaction amplitude since the late 1960s [3]. For recent reviews, see Refs [4,5]. For instance, different asymptopic behaviours of such a fundamental quantity as the total pp interaction cross section, \u03c3 T , are not excluded. Thus in the \"weak coupling\" regime, \u03c3 T (s \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 K, where K is a constant, while in the \"strong coupling\" regime \u03c3 T \u223c ln(s) \u03b5 with 0 < \u03b5 < 2.

The TOTEM experiment [6,7] will measure the total cross section and elastic scattering, detecting protons in Roman pots, and make some studies of high cross section diffractive interactions. Downstream of the ATLAS experiment, the ALFA project consists of a set of Roman pots with fiber tracking, also for elastic scattering and total cross section measurements. In this paper, the concept of using forward shower counters, FSC, to detect and trigger on rapidity gaps in diffractive events at the LHC is presented. The benefits of the FSC system for the study of single and central diffractive reactions are shown. Extensive simulations of several reactions have been performed to establish the efficiency of the FSC detector arrangement. The main application of these studies will be for low luminosity running with a small probability of pile-up (more than one inelastic pp collision per bunch crossing). This study parallels that of ref. [8] and that presented in a proposal to the CMS Collaboration [9]. In this paper we refer specifically to CMS, but the other three central detectors may similarly benefit from such very forward detectors.",

The detectors closely surround the elliptical (3 mm thick) copper beam pipes (aperture half sizes 26.5 mm (vertically) and 64 mm (horizontally)). Accessible Figure 2. Region between the MBXW (D1) magnets where the FSC counters can be installed. (Photograph taken before the connecting pipe was installed; it shows accessible elliptical beam pipe regions.) positions along the beam pipes are at 60 m < |z| < 85 m (z is the coordinate along the beam direction), and at further locations out to z = \u00b1140 m on both sides of the interaction point (IP5 for CMS), see figure 1. At these locations the beam pipes are accessible, and not in a cryogenic region. The FSC do not detect particles directly from the collisions, but they detect showers from forward particles that interact in the beam pipe and surrounding material. Similar counters, called beam shower counters (BSC), were placed along the beam pipes downstream of the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) detector [10]. These detectors can be used to make measurements of rapidity gaps for events without pile-up, in the early days of LHC running. The average number of inelastic collisions per bunch crossing, n , for \u03c3 inel = 80 mb, luminosity = 4\u00d710 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , 2808 bunches and \u03b2 * = 2 m is n \u223c 1.0, and then e \u2212 n = 0.368 is the fraction of bunch crossings with no inelastic collisions (and 36.8% of diffractive, or any other specific, collisions are not spoiled by pile-up). These conditions give the highest rate of diffractive collisions without pile-up. When n = 2(3) rapidity gap physics can still be done, but with lower efficiency, \u03b5 = 13.5(5.0)% respectively. As most of the pile-up events will have forward particles giving showers in the FSC, they can be effectively vetoed at the level-1 trigger, increasing the efficiency of diffractive triggers. For single diffractive excitation one would require all the counters on one side (in logical OR) to be consistent with noise. Showers will usually give a large pulse height, many times that of a minimum ionizing particle (MIP), and are easily discriminated from noise. Off-line, multiple events in a bunch crossing also usually give more than one primary vertex, as reconstructed from the excellent tracking capabilities of CMS. However low mass diffractive excitation can have all particles at small polar angles, and in some cases will not have measured tracks, or they will not form a reconstructable primary vertex.",

These six triggers all involve large ( 5) rapidity gaps and will contain no pile-up events, so their rate will decrease approximately exponentially once n 3. In addition to their value in triggering on and studying diffractive collisions without pileup, the FSC counters can provide real-time monitoring of beam conditions (beam halo) for both incoming and outgoing beams (which are both in the same pipe at these locations). The separation of incoming and outgoing beams can be done by timing the scintillation counter signals at a few locations where their time separation is 10 ns (the maximum being 12.5 ns).

The Collider Detector at Fermilab, CDF, installed a similar set of counters (beam shower counters, BSC) used as rapidity gap detectors [10] and put in veto at level-1 for some physics (central exclusive production) [11]. These were pairs of scintillation counters, closely surrounding the beam pipe, at each of three (four on one side) locations, 6.6m, 23.2m, 31.6m (and 56.4m) from the intersection point. The closest counters had acceptance for primary particles with 5.4 < |\u03b7| < 5.9, and were preceded by two radiation lengths of lead to convert photons. The other counters were behind quadrupoles, electrostatic separators and (for the last counter) a dipole magnet. These only detected showers produced by particles in the beam pipe and surrounding material. Together they covered 5.4 < |\u03b7| < 7.4. The Tevatron beam has y(p) = 7.65, where rapidity y(p) = ln \u221a s m(p) . They were used effectively both in level-1 triggers, and to tag events with proton dissociation. CDF also had a set of Roman pot detectors, with tracking, to measure diffractively scattered antiprotons. It was found that even when n < 1, high mass single diffraction studies (X = dijets, W, Z + hadrons) with ap track are dominated by pile-up (th\u0113 p and X being from different collisions) unless a rapidity gap (or at least a region of low activity) in thep direction is required. Note however that in central exclusive production with both protons detected (p + p \u2192 p + X + p) 4-momentum conservation and precision (relative) timing of the protons enable physics to be done even with n 20 [2]. In the following, a physics motivation is given for single diffractive excitation studies, and especially for central exclusive production. We then present efficiency calculations.",

This reaction allows for a rich physics program [12], and in particular it provides a unique possibility to study the two-gluon mediated color singlet interaction (i.e. using the LHC as a \"gluon-gluon collider\" gg \u2192 gg). In central exclusive production (or diffraction) the gg \u2192 qq background is, in general, suppressed compared to gg \u2192 gg due to color and spin factors.

In addition to low mass exclusive central states (with all particles reconstructed, and mass M(X ) 10 GeV/c 2 ), the same trigger will collect high mass double pomeron events, with M(X ) up to about 100 GeV/c 2 . The jet content of such events, and in particular the subset of exclusive di-jets, is a valuable probe of the parton constituents in the pomeron. Most such jets should be gluon jets. One can compare IP + IP collisions at M(X ) with pp collisions at \u221a s = M(X ). Some differences may be: a larger content of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons and a smaller baryon fraction because of the higher glue content. Pomerons should have a smaller transverse size than protons, and this may manifest itself in relatively more double parton scattering (2 \u00d7 (gg \u2192 JJ)) and perhaps also in Bose-Einstein correlations, which measure the size of the pion emission region. Double parton scattering, seen in 4-jet events having two pairwise-balancing dijets, is a probe of the (unintegrated) two-gluon density G 2 (x i , x j ). Other ideas for early LHC running using forward detectors for rapidity gap based physics have been presented [12].

Once data are obtained at low luminosity with a zero-bias (bunch crossing) trigger, it will be possible to optimise the cuts, for each detector, to provide the best separation between events with a true gap (no particles) and with particles. As in the CDF analysis, one can divide the zero-bias events into two classes: those apparently empty (no tracks and no large electromagnetic clusters) and those with interactions. For such studies it is necessary to have zero-bias data recorded, especially at low luminosity when the fraction of empty crossings is not too small. The efficiencies as a function of diffractive mass for these conditions, along with what would be obtained using only T1/HF, T2/CASTOR, FSC or ZDC detectors are shown in figure 4. The efficiency is >90% for the lower mass region, and approximately 100% for masses above 10 GeV (not shown). Approximately 25% of the single diffractive cross section is for masses below 10 GeV (at \u221a s = 14 TeV). Forward multiparticle states from central inclusive diffraction reactions would have similar detection eficiency.  Simulations have also been made for exclusive diffractive baryon resonance production, such as p + p \u2192 p + N * (1440) with N * \u2192 p + \u03c0 0 , n + \u03c0 + , or \u2206 ++ + \u03c0 \u2212 . In figures 5-7 the efficiencies for detecting these final states are shown as functions of the diffractive mass. For N * \u2192 p + \u03c0 0 the average efficiency is 70% (figure 5), for N * \u2192 n + \u03c0 + it is close to 100% (figure 6), and for N * \u2192 \u2206 ++ + \u03c0 \u2212 it is about 70% ( figure 7).",

The relation depends on the p T distribution (and hence p T ) of the produced particles. The \"adjacent rapidity gap\" is defined as the gap between the diffractive proton (close to the beam rapidity, y beam = 9.6 at \u221a s = 14 TeV) and the nearest particle in rapidity. Larger rapidity gaps correspond to smaller diffractive masses. The approximate correspondence between the diffractive mass M and the (pseudo)rapidity gap \u2206\u03b7 is M(X) \u221a s 2 \u223c e \u2212\u2206\u03b7 . From the theoretical point of view it is more instructive to consider the distribution d\u03c3 SD d\u03b7 \u2032 , where \u03b7 \u2032 is the position of the edge of the gap. Although asymptotically dM 2 M 2 = d\u03b7 \u2032 due to angular ordering of gluon emission, different contributions to \u03c3 SD are separated from each other in \u03b7 \u2032 rather than in M.",
