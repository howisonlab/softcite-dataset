The relative abundance of baryons and mesons can shed light on the process of fragmentation -a non-perturbative process -and deviations from measurements made at e + e \u2212 colliders may hint at specific processes occuring in the higher partonic density environment of pp and p-Pb collisions. In addition, these measurements also provide a reference for future measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions, where the baryon-to-meson ratio is expected to be sensitive to modified hadronisation mechanisms such as coalescence [1]. Preliminary results from STAR [2] hint at an enhanced \u039b + c /D 0 ratio in Au-Au collisions.",

Selection is made on the hadron decay topology, the signal is extracted via an invariant mass analysis, and corrections are made for the efficiency, acceptance, and the fraction of non-prompt hadrons in the signal sample. The semileptonic decays of \u039b + c and \u039e 0 c baryons are also reconstructed via the decay channels \u039b + c \u2192 e + \u03bd e \u039b and (\u039e 0 b \u2192)\u039e 0 c \u2192 e + \u03bd e \u039e \u2212 . Here the analyses are not based on topological selections, and are instead based on subtracting the 'wrong-sign' e \u2212 \u039b(e \u2212 \u039e \u2212 ) pair spectra from the 'right-sign' e + \u039b(e + \u039e \u2212 ) spectra. Additional corrections include correcting for contributions to the wrong-sign spectra from \u039b b (\u039e 0 b ), and unfolding the e \u2212 \u039b(e \u2212 \u039e \u2212 ) p T spectra to obtain the \u039b + c (\u039e 0 c ) p T spectrum. A correction for feed-down from \u039e +,0 c is also included for the \u039b + c measurement. . The statistical precision of the measurements has been improved by approximately a factor of 2 with respect to the previous measurement [4] due to an increased integrated luminosity. The models describe the data well, although a suppression larger than 15-20% for p to perturbative calculations at NLO using the GM-VFNS [5,6] scheme in pp collisions, and at NLO with powheg [7] matched with pythia 6.4.25 [8] in pp and p-Pb collisions. For the p-Pb powheg the EPS09 nuclear PDF was used [9]. GM-VFNS underpredicts the data by a factor of 2.5 on average, and powheg underpredicts the data by a factor of 18(4) at low(high) p T in pp collisions, and by a similar amount in p-Pb collisions. Figure 3 (left) shows the baryon-to-meson ratio \u039b + c /D 0 measured using the \u039b + c cross sections presented in this paper and the D 0 cross sections measured by ALICE [4,10]. In the same figure theoretical predictions in pp collisions are shown including pythia8 with and without a tune including enhanced colour reconnection [11], dipsy [12] with rope hadronisation and herwig7 [13] with hadronisation via clusters. The \u039b + c /D 0 ratio in pp collisions is compatible with the same ratio in p-Pb collisions within uncertainties. While all models underpredict the data, pythia8 with enhanced colour reconnection brings the prediction closer to data.  [4], and predictions including powheg+pythia with EPS09 nuclear PDF [9] and a prediction for charmed hadrons which assumes a small-size QGP is formed [14]. The R pPb of \u039b + c is consistent with unity and with the D-meson R pPb , and does not allow to distinguish between the models presented within the current experimental uncertainties.    c \u2192 e + \u03bd e \u039e \u2212 /D 0 in comparison to predictions from pythia with the aforementioned tunes. The shaded band for the models spans the range of theoretical predictions for the \u039e 0 c \u2192 e + \u03bd e \u039e \u2212 branching ratio [15][16][17]. As for the \u039b + c /D 0 ratio, all predictions significantly underestimate the data.  ",
