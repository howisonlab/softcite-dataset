These measurements were obtained using modular forward detectors. The Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS), covering a region of 2.5 < \u03b7 < 4.0, and its engineering prototype, provide increased acceptance, as needed for spin-dependent correlation studies that could disentangle contributions to the forward \u03c0 0 asymmetries. We report on the status of the analysis.",

            "text": "For a particle produced in a collision of transversely polarized protons, the analyzing power (A N ) is defined as the difference of spin-up and spin-down cross sections divided by their sum. A N is just one of many examples of transverse single spin asymmetries. A N is expected to be near zero in a leading-twist and collinear perturbative QCD (pQCD) description of particle production. Cross sections for pions produced with large Feynman-x (2p L / s ) and moderate p T in p+p collisions are found to be in agreement with next-to-leading order pQCD calculations at s =200 GeV [1,2]. Precision measurements of the asymmetry as a function of x F and p T were reported, showing large A N at large x F [3]. Also, it was shown that the x F dependence matches the Sivers effect [4,5] expectations qualitatively. The p T dependence at fixed x F is not consistent with expectations of p-QCD based calculations.",

New phenomenological analyses within a generalized parton model can now explain Sivers moments in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and many features of p\u2191+p \u2192 \u03c0 +X [6]. Previous expectations that the Collins effect [7] is suppressed in p\u2191+p \u2192 \u03c0 +X were found incorrect due to a sign error [8]. COMPASS analyzed 20 percent of their transversely polarized proton data and reported non-zero Collins moments and Sivers moments compatible with zero, although the expected Sivers moments are small in the (x,Q 2 ) range of their experiment. To conclude, the need still remains to separate Collins and Sivers effects in p\u2191+p \u2192 \u03c0 +X.",

The Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) now provides STAR with full coverage of the azimuth in the range 2.5 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 4.0. The forward acceptance of STAR has been increased 20x by the FMS. Studies of inclusive production in p+p and d(p)+Au collisions over a broad range of x F and p T for mesons that decay electromagnetically to observed photons, electrons and positrons are now enabled.

Individual detector conversion gains are iteratively adjusted to give the Gaussian centroid at the \u03c0 mass in di-photon invariant mass distributions associated with each detector. Events used for calibration were required to satisfy a hardware-level individual detector threshold condition and have at least two photons reconstructed within a fiducial volume of the calorimeter. The two highest energy photons in an event are used to compute the mass. The energy sharing, defined as |E 1 -E 2 |/(E 1 +E 2 ), must be < 0.7 for the small cells. In addition to adjustments of linear calibration factors for each detector, energy dependent corrections are found to be required. The centroid of the \u03c0 peak in the mass distributions is found to increase with leading photon energy for both the data and full GEANT simulations. For the latter, it is found that when energy dependent corrections are applied to give the correct centroid for the pion peak in di-photon invariant mass distributions binned in leading photon energy, the reconstructed di-photon energy, on average, agrees with the generated pion energy.",
