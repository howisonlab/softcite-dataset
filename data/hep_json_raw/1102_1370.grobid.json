The determination of angles \u03b1 and \u03b3 still suffers from larger experimental uncertainties.

Neglecting possible electroweak penguins (EWP) amplitudes, which do not obey SU(2) isospin symmetry, A \u00b10 receives only tree amplitude contributions. The small A CP value measured in B + \u2192\u03c1 + \u03c1 0 decay indicates that the contribution from EWPs is negligible, and the isospin analysis holds within an uncertainty of 1 \u2212 2 \u2022 [11]. Other possible isospin violation effects due to finite \u03c1 width [12] are tested by varying the \u03c0\u03c0 mass window. Such effects are below the current sensitivity. If A +0 and\u00c3 \u22120 are aligned with a suitable choice of phases, the relations in Eq. (3) can be represented in the complex plane by two triangles, and the phase difference between A +\u2212 and\u00c3 +\u2212 is 2\u2206\u03b1. Isospin relations similar to Eq. (3) hold separately for each polarization state. However, since f L \u223c 1, only the analysis of CP -even longitudinal decay is performed. Constraints on the CKM angle \u03b1 and on the penguin contribution \u2206\u03b1 are obtained from a confidence level (CL) scan. Assuming the isospin-triangle relations of Eq. (3), a \u03c7 2 for the five amplitudes (A +0 , A +\u2212 , A 00 ,\u00c3 +\u2212 ,\u00c3 00 ) is calculated from the measurements summarized in Table I, and minimized with respect to the parameters that don't enter the scan. The 1 \u2212 CL values are then calculated from the probability of the minimized \u03c7 2 . Results of such a scan are reported in Fig. 1 Since the measured BFs of the several reactions satisfy B(B . The red solid (blue dotted) line represents the result found using the latest [8] (previous [13]) B\u2192\u03c1 + \u03c1 0 BF measurement.",

K 1 (1270) and K 1 (1400) are both axial vector mesons, they have overlapping mass distributions and both decays to K\u03c0\u03c0, hence they undergo notnegligible interference effects. In order to include interference effects in the fit, in a recent analysis by BABAR [19] the K 1 system is parameterized in terms of a two-resonance, six-channel K-matrix model [20] in the P -vector approach [21]. A partial wave analysis of the diffractively produced K\u03c0\u03c0 system performed by the ACCMOR collaboration [20] is used to determine the decay couplings and the mass poles of the K-matrix. Signal yields are extracted using a ML fit to m ES , \u2206E, and SC. The invariant mass of the resonant K\u03c0\u03c0 system is sensitive to the production parameters of the K 1 system. The combined signal branching fractions are B(B 0 \u2192K 1 (1270) + \u03c0 \u2212 + K 1 (1400) + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 31 +8 \u22127 \u00d7 10 \u22126",

Nonfactorizable contributions to transition amplitudes from exchange and weak annihilation diagrams are neglected [15,22].\u03b4 is assumed to be negligible. a 1 and K 1A form factors, that are needed in the analysis, are obtained from the study of \u03c4 decays [23]. A Monte Carlo method is used to derive the 68% and 90% CL upper limits for \u2206\u03b1 [19]. The result is |\u2206\u03b1| < 11 \u2022 (13 \u2022 ) at the 68% (90%) CL. Combining this bound with the results from B 0 \u2192a 1 (1260) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 TD analysis [18], the final result is \u03b1 = (79 \u00b1 7 \u00b1 11) \u2022 for the solution compatible with the CKM global fits, where the first error is statistical and systematic combined and the second is due to penguin pollution.",
