This involves the detection of elastically scattered and diffractive protons at a location very close to the beam, together with efficient forward charged particle detection in inelastic events with losses reduced to few per-cents. This is accomplished with its experimental setup, characterized by three detector components located on both sides of the interaction point (IP) 5, shared with CMS (figure 1): the T1 and T2 inelastic telescopes, embedded inside the forward region of CMS, and the \"Roman Pots\" detectors, placed on the beam-pipe of the outgoing beams in two stations at about 147 m and 220 m from IP 5.",

They allow the measurement of inelastic rates with small losses, given their trigger capability with a geometric acceptance grater than 95% for all inelastic events. At the same time they can provide the reconstruction of the interaction vertex, allowing to reject background events. Each arm of the T1 telescope, located at \u223c 9 m from IP 5, covers the range 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.7 and is composed of five planes of \"Cathode Strip Chambers\" (CSC) [1] (figure 2, left). Each plane consists of six trapezoidal CSCs, with 10 mm thick gas gap and a gas mixture of Ar/CO 2 /CF 4 (40%/50%/10%), providing the measurement of the charged particle hit position with a spatial resolution of \u223c 1 mm. The anode wires (pitch of 3 mm), also giving level-1 trigger information, are parallel to the trapezoid base, while the cathode strips (pitch of 5 mm) are rotated by \u00b1 60 o with respect to the wires. The T2 telescope extends charged track reconstruction to the range 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5 [1]. It is based on the \"Gas Electron Multiplier\" (GEM) technology [4], which has been chosen thanks to its good spatial resolution, excellent rate capability and good resistance to radiation. Each T2 halfarm, located at \u223c 13.5 m from IP 5, is made by the combination of ten aligned detectors planes having an almost semicircular shape (figure 2, right). The T2 GEMs are characterized by a triple-GEM structure with a gas mixture of Ar/CO 2 (70%/30%) [5]. The read-out board has two separate layers with different patterns: one with 256x2 concentric circular strips (80 \u00b5m wide, pitch of 400 \u00b5m), allowing the track radial coordinate reconstruction with a resolution of \u223c 100 \u00b5m; the other with a matrix of 24x65 pads (from 2x2 mm 2 to 7x7 mm 2 in size) providing the reconstruction of the track azimuthal coordinate with a resolution of \u223c 1 o , as well as level-1 trigger information. ''Leading\" protons with a scattering angle down to few \u00b5rad are detected by special movable beam-pipe insertions called Roman Pots (RPs). They host silicon detectors which are moved very close to the beam, when it is in stable conditions. As the detection of protons at such small scattering angles requires a detector active area as close to the beam as \u223c 1 mm, a novel \"edgeless planar silicon\" detector technology has been developed for TOTEM RPs in order to have an edge dead zone minimized to only \u223c 50 \u00b5m [6]. Each RP station is composed of two units, in order to have a lever harm for a better local track reconstruction and a higher efficiency of trigger selection by track angle. Each unit consists of three pots, two vertical and one horizontal completing the acceptance for diffractively scattered protons. Each pot contains a stack of 10 planes of silicon strip detectors (figure 3). Each plane has 512 strips (pitch of 66 \u00b5m), oriented at +45 o (5 \"u\"-planes) or at \u221245 o (5 \"v\"-planes) w.r.t. the detector edge facing the beam, allowing a single hit resolution of \u223c 10 \u00b5m. The VFAT digital chip [3], specifically designed for TOTEM and characterized by trigger capabilities, provides the read-out of all TOTEM sub-detectors and the related trigger information.",

Since \u03c3 * \u0398 = /\u03b2 * , this can be obtained either by increasing the value of the betatron function \u03b2 at IP (\u03b2 * ) or by reducing the beam emittance ( ). Given the higher control on \u03b2 * , special LHC runs with a dedicated machine optics configuration at high \u03b2 * are required. The consequent increase in beam size at the interaction point characterizes these runs with a low luminosity (L), which is anyway needed in TOTEM analyses in order to avoid extra interactions between the colliding bunches.

A total luminosity of 6.1 nb \u22121 was integrated, with the RP detectors approaching the beams as close as 7 times the transverse beam size (\u03c3 b ). This measurement has been extended to |t| values as low as 2\u202210 \u22122 GeV 2 by analyzing the data recorded in a short run taken in June 2011 with a dedicated beam optics configuration ( \u03b2 * = 90 m) and low luminosity, during which a luminosity of 1.7 \u00b5b \u22121 was integrated with the RPs placed at 10 \u03c3 b [8]. This made for the first time the extrapolation to the optical point (t = 0) possible, so allowing the determination of the elastic scattering cross-section (\u03c3 el ) as well as of \u03c3 tot via the optical theorem. Even smaller |t| values, down to 5\u202210 \u22123 GeV 2 , were then obtained with an updated analysis performed using different higher statistics data sets (for a total of 83 \u00b5b \u22121 ) taken in October 2011 with special runs at \u03b2 * = 90 m, where the RPs were put very close to the beam (4.8 to 6.5 \u03c3 b ) [9].

Bin migration effects, due to angular resolution (related to detector resolution and beam divergence effects), have been corrected using a Monte Carlo (MC) based iterative procedure.

In order to perform an optimized study of the trigger efficiency and of the beam-gas background corrections, the inelastic events were separated into three subsamples: with tracks in both T2 arms (mainly due to non diffractive and to double diffractive processes) and with tracks in only one (\"+\" or \"-\") of the two T2 arms (mainly due to single diffractive processes). Special emphasis was given to properly tune the simulation of the forward region, in particular in front and around T2, since the secondary particles, produced in this zone by the interaction of primary particles with the material, enhance the observed inelastic rate. To obtain the true inelastic rate the observed one had to be properly corrected. The corrections, derived with studies on proper MC samples, \"zero bias\" and \"non colliding bunch\" trigger data, were done in three steps allowing to get: the \"T2 visible\" cross-section (\u223c 95% of \u03c3 inel , related to events with at least one particle in the |\u03b7| acceptance of T2, i.e. with 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5); the \"global visible\" cross-section (related to events with at least one particle up to the |\u03b7| acceptance of T2, i.e. with |\u03b7| < 6.5); the \"missing\" cross-section (related to events with only particles beyond the T2 acceptance, i.e. with |\u03b7| > 6.5, mainly due to single diffractive processes with masses below \u223c 3.4 GeV/c 2 ). These studies showed in particular a very good performance of the T1 and T2 detectors, characterized by an event reconstruction efficiency of about 98% (99%) for an individual T1 (T2) arm. After comparing several MC models, the correction for the missing low mass single diffractive cross-section has been obtained based on the QGSJET-II-03 generator, which can well describe the measurements of low mass diffraction at lower energies. This correction (4.2 \u00b1 2.1 %) is the largest one to the inelastic rate and, given the large uncertainty, represents the second largest systematic uncertainty of this measurement after the one related to the luminosity (4%). The result, reported in table 1, is well in agreement with the previous TOTEM measurements deduced from the elastic scattering via the optical theorem [8,9] as well as compatible with the measurements performed by ALICE [12], AT-LAS [13] and CMS [14]. However, given the unique \u03b7 coverage of the T1 and T2 detectors allowing to reach the lowest diffractive masses (M X > 3.4 GeV/c 2 ), this measurement is characterized by a minimal model dependence for the required low mass diffraction corrections respect to the measurements performed by the other LHC experiments.",

The relative alignment between the two neighbouring quarters of an arm has been derived using tracks reconstructed in the overlap regions. The global detector alignment respect to its nominal position (corrections for tilts and shifts), of main importance for the present analysis, has been achieved by exploiting the expected symmetry in the track parameters distributions, as well as the position on each T2 plane of the \"beam pipe shadow\" (a circularshaped zone characterized by a very low track efficiency due to primary particles interaction in the \u03b7 \u223c 5.54 beam pipe cone in front of T2). The combination of all these methods resulted in corrections for x-and y-shifts with a precision of \u223c 1 mm and for xz-and yz-plane tilts with a precision of \u223c 0.4 mrad.",

These comprise the d\u03c3 el /dt measurement in a wide |t| range (5\u202210 \u22123 < |t| < 2.5 GeV 2 ), as well as the measurement of \u03c3 el , \u03c3 inel and \u03c3 tot using different methods. These last results are in good agreement within the errors with the theoretical expectations and, for what concerns \u03c3 inel , with the measurements of other LHC experiments. The dN ch /d\u03b7 distribution was also measured in the 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.4 range. The analysis of the data taken in 2012 at \u221a s = 8 TeV with \u03b2 * = 90 m gave the L-independent measurement of \u03c3 tot , \u03c3 el and \u03c3 inel , again found in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Work is in progress for the analysis of other data samples taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV. In particular, the ones with \u03b2 * = 1000 m are expected to open the possibility of the \u03c1 parameter measurement, while the ones taken jointly with CMS will provide the first common physics results on hard and soft diffraction as well as the dN ch /d\u03b7 measurement over the whole \u03b7 range up to |\u03b7| \u223c 6.5.",
