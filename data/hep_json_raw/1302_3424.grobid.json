The centrality dependence of the spectral shape is an important tool to understand the energy loss mechanism. The ATLAS detector at the LHC accumulated integrated luminosity equal to 0.15 nb \u22121 of lead-lead data at 2.76 TeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. Due to the excellent capabilities of the ATLAS detector, and its stable operation in 2010 and 2011 heavy ion physics runs, these data allow measurements of the charged particle spectra and their ratios in different centrality bins over a wide range of transverse momenta (0.5-150 GeV) and pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 2.5). The measured ratio central to peripheral events shows a suppresion by a factor of 5 at p T = 7 GeV. At higher p T the ratio increases.",

Measurement of fully-reconstructed jets by the ATLAS experiment [2] revealed a factor of two suppression of jet yields in central collisions with respect to peripheral ones [3]. Results from the LHC experiments (e.g. [4]) do not show significant modification of the fragmentation function for large longitudinal jet momentum fractions carried by the charged particles. Measuring inclusive hadron production at high transverse momentum (p T ) originating from parton fragmentation is another way to study the mechanism by which hard partons traversing the medium loose their energy.",

Tracks are required to have zero Pixel and SCT holes. A hole appears on a track if a hit, predicted by the track trajectory, is not found in the detector layer. The contribution from fake tracks (i.e. tracks composed of randomly associated hits in the detector layers) and secondary particles (decay products of e.g. B and D mesons) are reduced by requiring the significance of d 0 and z 0 sin \u03b8, i.e. the distance of closest approach of the track to the event vertex in the transverse and longitudinal directions divided by the estimated uncertainty on this parameter for each measured track, to be less than 3. The d 0 and z 0 sin \u03b8 parameters and their uncertainties are estimated by a vertex finding algorithm.",

At the lowest measured p T the fraction is up to 10% (mainly contributed by secondaries) for central events and high |\u03b7|, and rapidly decreases with increasing p T . At p T \u2248 1 GeV the fraction is about 1% and it is negligible above 4 GeV. Corrections for the inefficiency of the track reconstruction and the momentum resolution are applied at once using bin-by-bin corrections. The efficiencies can be seen of Fig. 1. The track reconstruction efficiency is found to be highest in the region |\u03b7| < 1 and decreases with increasing |\u03b7|. The efficiency decreases at low p T as well as at very high p T .
