            "text": "The study of the multiplicity distributions of identified particles, in terms of their moments, is one of the major topics in high energy nuclear collision experiments. For a system in statistical equilibrium, such as strongly interacting matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions, specific combinations of the moments of multiplicity distributions, referred to as event-by-event fluctuation signals, are directly related to the equation of state of strongly interacting matter [1,2,3]. The standard approaches of the determination of e-by-e fluctuations signals are to count the number of particles in each collision (event). However, in experiments, it is often challenging to identify uniquely the type of every detected particle due to overlapping particle identification signals. For this reason, analyses of identified particle fluctuations are usually performed in a limited kinematic acceptance, where particle identification is relatively reliable, or exploiting additional detectors. These procedures, however, reduce the overall experimental acceptance and/or particle identification efficiencies, which ultimately pushes the fluctuations of interest to the Poisson limit.",

The distributions of pions, protons and deuterons exhibit evident structures because the dE/dx distributions of these particles are relatively well separated from those of electrons and kaons as illustrated in the middle panel of Fig. 2. These structures are nothing but the smeared original multiplicity distributions because of the non-ideal particle identification, i.e., because of the overlapping dE/dx distributions of different particle species.

Consequently this yields the moments of both W j and Wj distributions including the mixed moments of their joint distributions.
