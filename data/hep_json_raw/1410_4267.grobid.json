The Lorentz violation is included in addition to standard three-flavor oscillations using the non-perturbative Standard Model Extension (SME), allowing the use of the full range of neutrino path lengths, ranging from 15 to 12,800 km, and energies ranging from 100 MeV to more than 100 TeV in the search. No evidence of Lorentz violation was observed, so limits are set on the renormalizable isotropic SME coefficients in the e\u00b5, \u00b5\u03c4 , and e\u03c4 sectors, improving the existing limits by up to seven orders of magnitude and setting limits for the first time in the neutrino \u00b5\u03c4 sector of the SME.",

The direct observation of Lorentz violation (LV) would provide access to this Planck-scale physics [3][4][5][6]. The Standard Model Extension [4][5][6][7][8] (SME) is an observer-independent effective field theory with all the features of the standard model and general relativity plus all possible LV terms. Lorentz violation can also include violation of charge-parity-time reversal (CP T ) symmetry [9] [10]. At experimentally accessible energies, these LV signatures are strongly suppressed by a factor of the order of m W /m P \u2248 10 \u221217 , the relative magnitudes of the electroweak and Planck scales [11]. Despite this suppression, numerous experimental techniques have been employed to search for LV phenomena [12][13][14].",

Previous searches within the SME framework have generally focused on sidereal variations, though they sometimes include time-independent components that only modify the spectrum. They have been performed in shortbaseline muon (anti)neutrino beams [18][19][20][21], the longbaseline NuMI neutrino beam [22,23], the Double-Chooz reactor experiment [24,25], and in atmospheric neutrinos at Ice Cube [26]. These experiments have generally used either the short-baseline [11] or perturbative [27] approximations of the SME to set limits on LV parameters and report limits for each parameter independently.",

For antineutrinos, the a T parameters go to \u2212(a T ) * and the c T T parameters go to (c T T ) * , which is equivalent to Re a T \u2192 \u2212 Re a T and Im c T T \u2192 \u2212 Im c T T . A common approach in neutrino oscillation experiments is to treat H LV as a small perturbation \u03b4h on the standard model Hamiltonian [27] and calculate the lowest order non-zero variations in the oscillation probability (first order when standard oscillations are present, second order when they are not, such as at short baselines). The sensitivity of Super-K to this model was evaluated [29]. However, for this approach to be valid the perturbation must be small, defined as |\u03b4h| 1/L. If we take the condition as |\u03b4h| < 10% \u00d7 (1/L), then more than 30% of the events in SK fail this perturbative condition for a T = 5 \u00d7 10 \u221224 GeV, resulting in unphysical oscillation probabilities greater than one and less than zero. Since the events failing the condition belong to the samples most sensitive to Lorentz-violation effects, this model was deemed inappropriate for the Super-K atmospheric neutrino analysis. Instead, we use an exact diagonalization of H which produces bounded oscillation probabilities in Super-K samples for all values of the Lorentz-violating coefficients, shown in detail in Appendix A. The accuracy of this calculation was ensured by confirming that the oscillation probabilities from the full diagonalization matched the standard three-flavor oscillation calculation used in SK (based on [57]) and the perturbative calculations for parameter values that were valid in the perturbative scheme. Figure 1 shows examples of the \u03bd \u00b5 survival probability vs. energy and path length for the a T and c T T parameters in the \u00b5\u03c4 sector. Standard oscillations appear as lines of constant L/E, which have slope one on these loglog plots. The a T \u00b5\u03c4 and a T e\u00b5 coefficients create oscillation patterns in \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance that depend only on length. These oscillations will appear as horizontal lines, which can be seen in Fig. 1(b) at high energies where there are no L/E oscillations. The distance (or equivalently cos \u03b8 z ) at which the LV oscillation begin is set by the value of a T . The c T T \u00b5\u03c4 and c T T e\u00b5 coefficients introduce LE oscillations which will appear as lines with slope minus one, which can be seen at high energies in Fig. 1(c). The value of c T T controls the energy the new oscillations begin at.",

Both a T e\u00b5 and c T T e\u00b5 behave much like their \u00b5\u03c4 counterpart in the highest energy samples, but also introduce some smaller but significant changes in the lower energy e-like and \u00b5-like samples that would allow the effects of the two sectors to be distinguished from one another. The a T e\u03c4 and c T T e\u03c4 terms, on the other hand, behave quite differently from the other sectors: they reduce or eliminate L/E oscillations that should otherwise occur at medium and higher energies. So, instead of extra \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance there is less. They also enhance the \u03bd e appearance signal at lower energies. Oscillograms are only shown for non-zero real parts of the parameters, but the real and imaginary parts produce similar oscillation effects in the high-energy regions where LVinduced oscillations are dominant.

However, there is generally some ambiguity between the real and imaginary parts since they produce similar oscillation effects at the energies where LV-oscillations dominate.

However, the long distances and high energies make the perturbative approach used in other experiments inappropriate, so we present the first analysis of Lorentz violation in neutrino oscillations where the full, non-perturbative Hamiltonian is used, combined with three-flavor neutrino oscillations. No evidence of LV is seen, so we set limits on the isotropic parameters a T and c T T in the e\u00b5, \u00b5\u03c4 , and e\u03c4 sectors. These are the first limits on the isotropic parameters in the \u00b5\u03c4 sector, and we improve the existing limits [12] on a T by 3 orders of magnitude and on c T T by seven orders of magnitude thanks to the wide range of energies and path lengths of the neutrinos in the atmospheric neutrino samples. Future studies of SK atmospheric neutrino data could also set limits on the directional parameters by searching for sidereal variations in the atmospheric neutrino data.",
