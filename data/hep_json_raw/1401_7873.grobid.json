They provide independent access to the transversity distribution functions through the measurement of the Collins asymmetry in single hadron production. The data were taken in the year 2010 with the COMPASS spectrometer using a 160 GeV/c muon beam of the CERN SPS, increasing by a factor of about four the overall statistics with respect to the previously published data taken in the year 2007. The measured sizeable asymmetry is in good agreement with the published data. An approximate equality of the Collins asymmetry and the dihadron asymmetry is observed, suggesting a common physical mechanism in the underlying fragmentation.",

            "text": "The quark structure of the nucleon can be characterised by parton distribution functions (PDFs) for each quark flavour [1]. If the quark intrinsic transverse momentum k T is integrated over, there remain at twist-two level three PDFs depending on the Bjorken scaling variable x and the negative square of the four-momentum transfer Q 2 , which exhaust the information on the partonic structure of the nucleon [2][3][4][5]. The spin-independent distribution f q 1 and the helicity distribution g q 1 have been measured with good accuracy. However, up to ten years ago nothing was known about the transverse spin distribution h q 1 , often referred to as transversity, which describes the probability difference of finding a quark q polarised parallel or antiparallel to the spin of a transversely polarised nucleon. This distribution is difficult to measure, since it is related to soft processes correlating quarks with opposite chirality, making it a chiral-odd function [1]. As a result, transversity can only be accessed through observables in which it appears coupled to a second chiral-odd object in order to conserve chirality. Thus it does not contribute to inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at leading twist. In semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) reactions the chiral-odd partners of the transversity distribution function are fragmentation functions (FFs), which describe the spin-dependent hadronisation of a transversely polarised quark q into hadrons. For a recent review see Ref. [6]. Up to now, most of the information on transversity came from the Collins asymmetry measured in single hadron asymmetries [7][8][9][10] and used in global analyses (e.g. [11]).",

            "text": "A complementary approach is to measure dihadron production in leptoproduction in SIDIS on transversely polarised nucleon, l N \u2191 \u2192 l h + h \u2212 X with both hadrons produced in the current fragmentation region [12][13][14][15]. In this reaction a new chiral-odd fragmentation function appears, the dihadron Fragmentation Function (DiFF) H 1 , which describes the spin-dependent part of the fragmentation of a transversely polarised quark into a pair of unpolarised hadrons describing a correlation of quark transverse spin with normal pseudo-vector to the dihadron momenta plane (the handedness) [16]. The transverse polarisation of the fragmenting quark is correlated with the relative momentum of the two hadrons, which gives rise to a transverse, target-spin-dependent azimuthal asymmetry around the virtual-photon direction, with respect to the lepton scattering plane. In this case, the sum of the total transverse momenta of the final state hadrons can be integrated over, leaving only the relative momentum of the two hadrons. This avoids the complexity of transverse-momentum-dependent convolution integrals as in the analysis of single hadron production utilising the Collins effect and the analysis can be performed using collinear factorisation [17,18]. Here, the evolution equations are known at next-to-leading order [19], so that results from e + e \u2212 scattering and SIDIS can be connected, making it a theoretically clean way to extract transversity using existing facilities [17]. The properties of the DiFFs are described in detail in Refs. [12][13][14][15][20][21][22][23].",

The DiFFs were first measured in e + e \u2212 reactions by Belle [25] and BaBar [26]. These measurements indicate a sizeable u quark transversity distribution -as already known from the measurements of the Collins asymmetry [9,27,7] and non-vanishing DiFFs [28,7]. Recently, COMPASS published results on dihadron asymmetry obtained from the data collected using transversely polarised deuteron ( 6 LiD) and proton (NH 3 ) targets in the years 2002-2004 and 2007, respectively [29]. Due to the large acceptance of the COMPASS spectrometer and the large muon momentum of 160 GeV/c, results with high statistics were obtained covering a large kinematic range in x and M h + h \u2212 , the invariant mass of the dihadron. Sizeable asymmetries were measured on the proton target while on the deuteron target only small asymmetries were observed. These results indicate non-vanishing u quark transversity and DiFFs, as well as a cancellation of the contributions of u and d quark transversities in the deuteron. Using these data sets in conjunction with the Belle data, a first parametrisation of the u and d quark transversities was performed based on a collinear framework [30]. The same procedure was applied to directly extract u and d quark transversities in the same x bins as used to obtain the COMPASS proton and deuteron results [31]. In this Letter, the dihadron azimuthal asymmetries measured from the data collected in 2010 with a transversely polarised proton target (NH 3 , as in 2007) are presented. The statistics accumulated in this data taking period increases the total available statistics on proton by a factor of four.",

This was ensured by extensive data quality tests described in detail in Ref. [27]. The remaining data sample was carefully scrutinised for a possible systematic bias in the final asymmetry. Here, the two main sources for uncertainties are false asymmetries, which can be evaluated by combining data samples with same target spin orientation, and effects of acceptance, which can be evaluated by comparing sub-samples corresponding to different ranges in the azimuthal angle of the scattered muon. No significant systematic bias could be found and the results from all 12 subperiods of data taking proved to be compatible. Therefore, an upper limit was estimated comparing the results of the systematic studies to expected statistical fluctuations. The resulting systematic uncertainty for each data point amounts to about 75% of the statistical uncertainty. An additional scale uncertainty of 2.2% accounts for uncertainties in the determination of target polarisation and target dilution factor calculated for semi-inclusive reactions [35].",

            "text": "The obtained asymmetry is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of x, z and M h + h \u2212 . Large negative asymmetry amplitudes are observed in the high x region, which implies that both, the transversity distributions and the spin-dependent dihadron fragmentation functions do not vanish. Over the measured range of the invariant mass M h + h \u2212 and z, the asymmetry is negative and shows no strong dependence on these variables. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the present results to the previously published COMPASS results on the proton target from 2007 data [29]. The results obtained from the data of 2010 have significantly smaller statistical uncertainties then the previous results from 2007 data and both are in good agreement (CL of 25%). Fig. 5 (top) shows the final result obtained by combining both data sets together with predictions from model calculations [36,37]. The bottom plot shows the same data with a cut on the quark valence region (x > 0.032) enhancing the observed signal as a function of z and M h + h \u2212 . In comparison to the published HERMES results [24], the results on the proton target presented in this work have higher statistics and cover a larger kinematic range in x and M h + h \u2212 . In the theoretical approach [21][22][23], all dihadron fragmentation functions for di-pion production were calculated in the framework of a spectator model for the fragmentation process. Predictions were made for the DiFF H 1 as well as for the s-and p-wave contributions to the spin-independent fragmentation functions D 1 and in Ref. [23] the expected asymmetries for COMPASS were calculated assuming different models for the transversity distributions. Recently, these parametrisations of the dihadron fragmentation functions from Ref. [23] were also used together with the transversity distributions extracted from single hadron production [11] to make predictions for both proton and deuteron targets in the kinematic range covered by COMPASS. The calculated asymmetry is shown as solid blue lines in Fig. 5 (top and bottom). The latter adapted for the cut in x, shows a good agreement of these predictions with our  [36,37] made using the transversity functions extracted in Ref. [11] (solid lines) or a pQCD based counting rule analysis (dotted lines). The curves in the lower plots show the predictions of [36] in the same x \u2265 0.032 region. Note that the sign of the original predictions was changed to accommodate the phase \u03c0 in the definition of the angle \u03c6 R S used in the COMPASS analysis.",

A good agreement in terms of the M h + h \u2212 dependence is only in the mass region of the \u03c1 meson; no optimization of parameters in the calculation of the dihadron fragmentation function to extend the agreement over a larger M h + h \u2212 region (as e.g., the fraction of the \u03c9 to 3\u03c0 decay in the s-p interference) was performed by the authors. The prediction of Ma et al.

First, there is a mirror symmetry between the Collins asymmetry for positive and for negative hadrons, the magnitude of the asymmetry being essentially identical and the sign being opposite.

The hadron samples on which these asymmetries are evaluated are different [29,27] since at least one hadron with z > 0.2 is required to evaluate the Collins asymmetry, while all the combinations of positive and negative hadrons with z > 0.1 are used in the case of the dihadron asymmetry. It has been checked, however, that the similarity between the two different asymmetries stays the same when measuring the asymmetries for the common hadron sample, selected with the requirement of at least two oppositely charged hadrons produced in the primary vertex. This gives a strong indication that the analysing powers of the single and dihadron channels are almost the same.",

For each pair of oppositely charged hadrons, using the unit vectors of their transverse momenta, we have evaluated the angle \u03c6 2h of the vector R N =p T ,h + \u2212p T ,h \u2212 which is the arithmetic mean of the azimuthal angles of the two hadrons after correcting for the discussed \u03c0 phase difference between both angles. This azimuthal angle of the dihadron is strongly correlated with \u03c6 R , as can be seen in Fig. 7 where the difference of the two angles is shown. The same correlation is present also in the LEPTO generator for spin-independent DIS. Introducing the angle \u03c6 2h,S = \u03c6 2h \u2212 \u03c6 S , one simply obtains the mean of the Collins angle of the positive and negative hadrons (again after correcting for the discussed \u03c0 phase difference between the two angles), i.e. a mean Collins type angle of the dihadron. The amplitudes of the modulations of sin \u03c6 2h,S , which could then be called the Collins asymmetry for the dihadron, are shown as a function of x in Fig. 8 for all the h + h \u2212 pairs with z > 0.1 in the 2010 data, and compared with the dihadron asymmetry already given in Fig. 3, where an additional cut of p T > 0.1 GeV/c on the transverse momentum of the individual hadrons was applied for a precise determination of the azimuthal angles. The asymmetries are very close, hinting at a common physical origin for the Collins mechanism and the dihadron fragmentation function, as originally suggested in the 3 P 0 Lund model [39], in the recursive string fragmentation model [32,40] and in recent theoretical work [41]. 19 ",

The measured asymmetry amplitudes are in agreement with our previous measurement performed with data collected in 2007. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are considerably reduced. The combined results show a clear signal in the x range of the valence quarks and are in agreement with a recent theoretical calculation, using as input the transversity distribution obtained from global fits to the Collins asymmetry. As expected, the results do not show a strong z dependence. Clear structures are exhibited as a function of the dihadrons' invariant mass, with values compatible with zero at about 0.5 GeV/c 2 and a sharp fall to \u22120.05 at the \u03c1 mass. These new combined results will allow a more precise extraction of the transversity distributions along the lines of the models recently developed. The high precision and the large kinematic range of the COMPASS proton data allows us to compare the dihadron asymmetry and the Collins asymmetry. In the paper we underline the striking similarity between them and give arguments in favour of a common underlying physics mechanism, as already suggested in the past by several authors. In particular we show that in our data the angle commonly used in the dihadron asymmetry analysis is very close to the mean Collins angle of the two hadrons, and that thus the asymmetries evaluated using the two angles turn out to be very similar.",
