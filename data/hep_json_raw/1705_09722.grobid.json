The BESIII detector covers 93% of the solid angle around the collision point and consists of four main components: 1) A small-cell, heliumbased main drift chamber (MDC) with 43 layers providing an average single-hit resolution of 135 \u00b5m, and charged-particle momentum resolution in a 1 T magnetic field of 0.5% at 1 GeV/c; 2) A Time-Of-Flight system (TOF) for particle identification composed of a barrel and two end-caps. The barrel has two layers, each consisting of 88 pieces of 5 cm thick, 2.4 m long plastic scintillator. Each end-cap consists of 96 fan-shaped, 5 cm thick, plastic scintillators. The barrel (end-cap) time resolution of 80 ps (110 ps) provides a 2\u03c3 K/\u03c0 separation for momenta up to about 1.0 GeV/c; 3) An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consisting of 6240 CsI(Tl) crystals in a cylindrical structure, arranged in one barrel and two end-caps. The energy resolution for 1.0 GeV photons is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (end-caps), while the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) in the barrel (endcaps); 4) A muon counter (MUC) made of nine layers of resistive plate chambers in the barrel and eight layers in each end-cap, which are incorporated in the iron return yoke of the superconducting magnet. The position resolution is about 2 cm. A GEANT4 [13,14]-based detector simulation package has been developed to model the detector response.",
