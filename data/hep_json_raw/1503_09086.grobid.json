An attractive feature of B 0 s \u2192 D * \u2213 s K \u00b1 decays is that the theoretical formalism that relates the measured CP asymmetries to \u03b3 is the same as for B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 decays, when the angular momentum of the final state is taken into account in the time evolution of the B 0 s -B 0 s decay asymmetries.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.5 GeV. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one charged particle must have a transverse momentum p T > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [7] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron. The p T of the photon from D * \u2212 s decay is too low to contribute to the trigger decision.",
