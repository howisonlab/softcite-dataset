This analysis searches for W bosons in the W \u2192 tb decay channel in final states with electrons or muons, using a multivariate method based on boosted decision trees. The search covers masses between 0.5 and 3.0 TeV, for right-handed or left-handed W bosons. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed and limits are set on the W \u2192 tb cross-section times branching ratio and on the W -boson effective couplings as a function of the W -boson mass using the CL s procedure. For a left-handed (right-handed) W boson, masses below 1.70 (1.92) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Many approaches to theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) introduce new charged vector currents mediated by heavy gauge bosons, usually called W . For example, the W boson can appear in theories with universal extra dimensions, such as Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM W boson [1][2][3], or in theories that extend fundamental symmetries of the SM and propose a massive right-handed counterpart to the W boson [4][5][6]. Little Higgs theories [7] also predict a W boson. The search for a W boson decaying to a top quark and a b-quark explores models potentially inaccessible to searches for a W boson decaying into leptons [8][9][10][11]. For instance, in the right-handed sector, the W boson cannot decay to a charged lepton and a right-handed neutrino if the latter has a mass greater than the W -boson mass. Also, in several theories beyond the SM the W boson is expected to be coupled more strongly to the third generation of quarks than to the first and second generations [12,13]. Searches for a W boson decaying to the tb final state 1 have been performed E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. 1 For simplicity, the notation \"tb\" is used to describe both the W + \u2192 tb and W \u2212 \u2192tb processes. at the Tevatron [14,15] in the leptonic top-quark decay channel and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in both the leptonic [16][17][18] and fully hadronic [19] final states, excluding right-handed W bosons with masses up to 2.05 TeV at 95% confidence level (CL).",

The search is performed in the W \u2192 tb \u2192 \u03bdbb decay channel, where the lepton, , is either an electron or a muon, using a multivariate method based on boosted decision trees. Right-handed and left-handed W bosons, denoted W R and W L , respectively, are searched for in the mass range of 0.5 to 3.0 TeV. A general Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian is used to describe the couplings of the W boson to fermions for various W -boson masses [21,22]. The mass of the right-handed neutrino is assumed to be larger than the mass of the W boson [23], thus allowing only hadronic decays of the W R boson. In the case of a W L boson, leptonic decays are allowed and, since the signal has the same event signature as SM s-channel single top-quark production, an interference term between these two processes is taken into account [24].",

Simulated samples are normalised to next-toleading order (NLO) QCD calculations [22] using K -factors ranging from 1.15 to 1.35 depending on the mass and handedness of the W boson. The model assumes that the W -boson coupling strength to quarks, g , is the same as for the W boson: g R = 0 and g L = g (g R = g and g L = 0) for left-handed (right-handed) W bosons, where g is the SM SU(2) L coupling. The total width of the left-handed (right-handed) W boson increases from 17 to 104 GeV (12 to 78 GeV) for masses between 0.5 and 3.0 TeV, where the decay to leptons is (is not) allowed [21].

Electron candidates are required to be isolated, using a fixed cone-size isolation criterion [54], from other objects in the event and from hadronic activity, to reduce the contamination from mis-reconstructed hadrons, electrons from heavyflavour decays and photon conversions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [57] with a radius parameter R = 0.4, using topological energy clusters as inputs [58,59]. Jets are calibrated using energy-and \u03b7-dependent correction factors derived from simulation and with residual corrections from in situ measurements [60]. Jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To suppress jets from in-time pileup, at least 50% of the scalar p T sum of the tracks associated with a jet is required to be from tracks associated with the primary vertex [61].

            "text": "Systematic uncertainties can affect the shape and normalisation of the BDT output distributions. They are split into the categories described below. Object modelling: The main uncertainty in this category is due to uncertainties on b-tagging efficiency and mistagging rates [68,69]. The resulting uncertainty on the event yield is 6% for the total background contribution and 8-30% for the signal. The large uncertainties on the signal rates are due to additional b-tagging uncertainties for jets with p T above 300 GeV. These uncertainties range from 3% for b-jets with p T of 50 GeV up to 15% at 500 GeV and 35% above. The impact is sizeable for the signal where high-p T jets stem from the W -boson decay, in particular when the W -boson mass is above 1 TeV. The jet energy scale uncertainty depends on the p T and \u03b7 of the reconstructed jet and includes the uncertainty on the b-jet energy scale. It results in an uncertainty on event yields of 1-6% for the signal and 1-4% for the background, depending on the channel. The systematic uncertainty associated with the efficiency of the requirement on the jet vertex fraction results in rate variations of 2%. The impact of the jet energy resolution [70] and the jet reconstruction efficiencies on signal and background rates is small. Uncertainties related to lepton energy scale and resolution as well as trigger and identification efficiencies have a total effect of 2-4% on the signal and background rates. Another minor source of uncertainty comes from the propagation of the lepton and jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties to the E miss T . The impact of pileup effects is negligible. Simulation modelling: The dependence of the tt event yield on additional radiation is evaluated by varying Pythia parameters, while retaining consistency with a measurement of tt production with additional jet activity [71]. The variation in acceptance due to this source of uncertainty is 6-9%. The dependences of the tt, single top-quark s-channel and W t event yields on the generator and parton showering simulation are estimated by comparing the nominal Powheg+Pythia samples to samples produced using MC@NLO v4.03 [72,73] with the CT10 PDF set and interfaced to Herwig and Jimmy v4.31 [74], for simulation of the underlying event and parton shower. For the dominant tt background only, the uncertainties arising from the choice of hadronisation and parton shower models are also assessed by a comparison with Powheg+Herwig samples. This comparison results in a larger variation of the tt event yields (6-11%) and is thus taken as the associated systematic uncertainty. For the t-channel single top-quark process, the comparison is performed between the nominal AcerMC+Pythia sample and a sample simulated with aMC@NLO v2.1 [75] interfaced to Herwig. An uncertainty associated with the NLO calculation of W t production [76] is evaluated by comparing the baseline sample generated with the diagram removal scheme to a W t sample generated with the diagram subtraction scheme. The PDF uncertainty on all signal and background simulated samples is estimated, following the PDF4LHC recommendations [77], by taking the envelope of CT10, MWST2008nlo68cl [78] and NNPDF23 [79] PDF sets uncertainties at 68% CL and normalising to the nominal cross-section. The uncertainties on event yields are 9% for signal   [25], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale derived from beam-separation scans performed in November 2012.",

            "text": "No excess in data is observed over the full BDT output distributions. Therefore, the BDT distributions in the 2-jet and 3-jet channels, where electron and muon samples are separated, are used in a combined statistical analysis to calculate exclusion limits on the production cross-section of the left-handed or right-handed W boson as a function of its mass. The case of left-handed W -boson production is treated in two different ways. In the first, the interference between W L -boson and SM s-channel single top-quark production is neglected. The limits obtained are then valid only for the left-handed signal without the interference contribution. In the second, the interference effect is accounted for by considering the pp \u2192 W L /W \u2192 tb process as a unique signal and by setting limits Hypothesis testing is performed with the CL s procedure [81,82] using a log-likelihood ratio as the test statistic, defined as the ratio of two hypotheses: the test hypothesis, which admits the presence of a W -boson signal in addition to the SM backgrounds, and the null hypothesis, which considers only SM backgrounds. For a given hypothesis, the combined likelihood is the product of the likelihoods for the four individual channels considered (2/3-jet and electron/muon samples), each of which is a product of Poisson probabilities over the bins of the BDT output histogram. Pseudo-experiments are generated for both hypotheses, taking into account per-bin statistical fluctuations of the total predictions according to Poisson statistics, as well as Gaussian fluctuations describing the effect of systematic uncertainties. Correlations across bins, channels, and processes are taken into account. In order to reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties on the sensitivity of the search, a nuisance parameter corresponding to a scaling factor on the overall tt yield is fitted to data during the statistical analysis. This scaling factor is found to be consistent with unity. Fig. 4 shows the observed and expected 95% CL limit on the W -boson cross-section times branching ratio, as a function of the W -boson mass, for left-handed (without the interference term) and right-handed W -boson couplings. The fact that the observed limits are lower than expected can be explained by a deficit in data, compared to the predicted number of background events, in the high BDT output region. This deficit is also visible in the tails of the m tb distributions: it is rather localised at 1.1 TeV in 2-jet events, and widespread in 3-jet events (see Fig. 1). In the BDT distributions, however, this deficit is seen mostly at BDT output values higher than 0 in both 2-jet and 3-jet channels, in a region where the W -boson distributions peak (for W -boson masses of 1 TeV and above). In addition, because of the rather large width of the Theoretical cross-section times branching ratio values and observed 95% CL limits for left-handed and right-handed W \u2192 tb production (columns two to five) and for W L /W \u2192 tb production, including the interference term (last two columns). In the latter case, results are not shown for W -boson masses above 2 TeV due to the lack of W events in the W L /W \u2192 tb simulated samples generated at high values of the W -boson mass. signal BDT distributions, all W -boson cross-section limits are affected by these fluctuations in the data. The point where the measured cross-section limit crosses the theory curve defines the 95% CL lower limit on the W -boson mass. Masses below 1.92 (1.80, 1.70) TeV are excluded for righthanded (left-handed without and with interference) W bosons, while the expected limit is 1.75 (1.57, 1.54) TeV. The theoretical cross-section times branching ratio values and the observed limits are reported in Table 3 for several left-handed and right-handed W -boson hypotheses.",

Limits can also be set for g /g > 1, as models remain perturbative up to a ratio of about five [22]. A given hypothesis g for a W boson of mass m W is excluded if the resulting theoretical cross-section is higher than the cross-section limit derived previously. The W -boson cross-section has a non-trivial dependence on the coupling g , coming from the variation of the resonance width, which is proportional to g 2 . The scaling of the W -boson cross-section as a function of g /g and m W is estimated using MadGraph. The impact of NLO corrections on this scaling is found to be at most a few percent and is neglected. In addition, specific signal samples (see Section 3) are used in order to take into account the effect on the acceptance and on kinematical distributions of the increased signal width (compared to the nominal samples) for values of g /g > 1.
