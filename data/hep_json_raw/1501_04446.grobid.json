The KLOE08 analysis [7] used a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 240 pb \u22121 collected at \u221a s = m \u03c6 in 2002 and selection cuts in which the photon is emitted within a cone of \u03b8 \u03b3 < 15 \u2022 around the beamline (narrow cones in Fig.1) and the two charged pion tracks have 50 \u2022 < \u03b8 \u03c0 < 130 \u2022 (wide cones in Fig. 1). In this configuration, the photon is not detected and the photon momentum is reconstructed from missing momentum: p \u03b3 p miss = \u2212( p + + p \u2212 ).

The result confirms the current discrepancy (\u223c 3\u03c3) between the Standard Model (SM) calculation and the experimental value of the muon anomaly a \u00b5 measured at BNL. In the near future the \u03b3\u03b3 Physics program of the KLOE-2 experiment [13] will further shed light in this field, with e.g. the study of the radiative width of pseudoscalar mesons and of the transition form factors [14], thanks to the luminosity upgrade of DA\u03c6NE and the KLOE upgrade with the addition of new detectors: low energy [15] and high energy [16] e + e \u2212 taggers, an inner tracker [17], crystal calorimeters (CCALT) [18], and tile calorimeters (QCALT) [19].",
