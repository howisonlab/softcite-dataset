In particular, these TFFs enter as contributions to the hadronic lightby-light (HLbL) scattering calculations [2,3] that are important for more accurate theoretical determinations of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , within the SM [4,5]. Recently, data-driven approaches, using dispersion relations, have been proposed [2,3,6] to make a substantial and model-independent improvement to the determination of the HLbL contribution to (g\u22122) \u00b5 . The precision of the calculations used to describe the HLbL contributions to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 can then be tested by directly comparing theoretical predictions from these approaches for e/m TFFs of light mesons with experimental data. The precise knowledge of TFFs for light mesons is essential for precision calculation of the decay rates of those mesons in rare dilepton modes, e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [7,8]. So far there are discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental data for these rare decays, and the Dalitz decays of the corresponding mesons in the timelike (the energy transfer larger than the momentum transfer) momentum-transfer (q) region can be used in such calculations for both the normalization of these rare decays and as a background. The same applies to rare decays of light mesons into four leptons.",

QED predicts a specific strong dependence of the meson-A decay rate on the dilepton invariant mass, m \u2113\u2113 = q. A deviation from the pure QED dependence, caused by the actual electromagnetic structure of the meson A, is formally described by its e/m TFF [10]. The Vector-Meson-Dominance (VMD) model [11] can be used to describe the coupling of the virtual photon \u03b3 * to the meson A via an intermediate virtual vector meson V . This mechanism is especially strong in the timelike momentum-transfer region, (2m \u2113 ) 2 < q 2 < m 2 A , where a resonant behavior near q = m V of the virtual photon arises because the virtual vector meson is approaching the mass shell [10], or even reaching it, as for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 decay. Thus, measuring TFFs of light mesons is ideally suited for testing the VMD model.",

Note that the [QED(m \u2113\u2113 )] terms in Eqs. (1) and (3) and the angular dependence in Eq.

The most recent calculations of radiative corrections to the differential decay rate of the Dalitz decay \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 were reported by the Prague group in Ref. [13]. The authors of that work also mentioned that radiative corrections for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 could be evaluated by replacing the \u03c0 0 mass with the \u03b7 mass in their code. More precise calculations for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 by the Prague group are still in progress. Typically, taking radiative corrections into account makes the angular dependence of the virtualphoton decay weaker. The corrected [QED \u03b7 ] term integrated over cos \u03b8 * is \u223c1.5% larger than the leading-order term at low q and becomes \u223c10% lower at q = 455 MeV.

Using a quark model for the corresponding couplings would yield the TFF slope \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = 1.80 GeV \u22122 and \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 = 1.68 GeV \u22122 [10], corresponding to \u039b \u03b7 = 745 MeV and \u039b \u03c9\u03c0 0 = 772 MeV. The nearness of \u039b \u03c9\u03c0 0 to the \u03c1 mass comes from isospin conservation in the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decay, allowing only \u03b3 * \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 with I = 1, which eliminates contributions from \u03c9 and \u03c6 with I = 0.",

            "text": "From the experimental and phenomenological point of view, the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 TFF is currently the one investigated most. The early measurement of the \u03b7 slope parameter by Lepton-G [14], \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.90\u00b10.40 tot ) GeV \u22122 , was based on quite limited statistics. The first results from the NA60 Collaboration [15], \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.95 \u00b1 0.17 stat \u00b1 0.05 syst ) GeV \u22122 , was based on 2.6 \u2022 10 4 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs detected in peripheral In-In data, 9 \u2022 10 3 of which were identified to be from \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 decays. The latest experiment by the NA60 Collaboration with p-A collisions [12], which increased the statistics of muon pairs by one order of magnitute, reported \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.934 \u00b1 0.067 stat \u00b1 0.050 syst ) GeV \u22122 , improving significantly the accuracy, compared to the earlier result. The first measurement by the A2 Collaboration at MAMI, \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.92 \u00b1 0.35 stat \u00b1 0.13 syst ) GeV \u22122 , was based on an analysis of 1.35 \u2022 10 3 \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays [16]. Later on, a higher-accuracy result, \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.95 \u00b1 0.15 stat \u00b1 0.10 syst ) GeV \u22122 , obtained by the A2 Collaboration, was based on an analysis of 2.2 \u2022 10 4 \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays from a total of 3 \u2022 10 7 \u03b7 mesons produced in the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p reaction [17]. In that work, there is also a detailed discussion of agreement between the experimental data and recent calculations available for the \u03b7 TFF at the moment. Combining those A2 results with available experimental data in the spacelike (the energy transfer less than the momentum transfer) region allowed the Mainz theoretical group to extract the slope parameter with the smallest uncertainty, \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.919\u00b10.039) GeV \u2212 2 [18]. Such synergy between theory and experiment allowed a data-driven calculation of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 rare decay [8] and the reduction of the uncertainty in the pseudoscalar-exchange HLbL contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 [19]. The most recent \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 calculation with the updated dispersive analysis by the J\u00fclich group was presented in Ref. [20], demonstrating even better agreement with the data, compared to the previous calculations by this group in Ref. [21]. The improvement was based on including the a 2 -meson contribution in the dispersive analysis of the radiative decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 [22], which is connected to the isovector contributions of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 * TFF. This resulted in a better control of F \u03b7\u03b3 * \u03b3 calculations and a better consistency of these calculations with those for F \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 * \u03b3 . Also in Ref. [20], a better consistency was reached between the single off-shell form factor F \u03b7\u03b3 * \u03b3 and the double off-shell form factor F \u03b7\u03b3 * \u03b3 * , an accurate model-independent determination of which would be an important step towards a reliable evaluation of the HLbL scattering contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 .",

The level of background events, which comprised 11% from nonresonant sources and 3% from the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay (with charged pions decaying into muons) and the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, could be significant at high m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), where the theoretical predictions were not able to describe the Lepton-G data. Most recent measurements by the NA60 experiment in peripheral In-In data [15], \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 = (2.24 \u00b1 0.06 stat \u00b1 0.02 syst ) GeV \u22122 from 3 \u2022 10 3 \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, and in p-A collisions [12], \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 = (2.223 \u00b1 0.026 stat \u00b1 0.037 syst ) GeV \u22122 , were based on measuring the entire spectrum of the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant masses, without detecting any neutral finalstate particles.

The acceptance-corrected spectrum was then fitted with these three contributions. According to a more scrupulous analysis of p-A collisions, involving also much higher statistics than peripheral In-In data, all possible systematic uncertainties were very carefully taken into account. Though these latest |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results were slightly lower than from peripheral In-In data, they confirmed once again the discrepancy with the available predictions in the vicinity of the kinematic limit.",

            "text": "Motivated by the discrepancies between the theoretical calculations of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF and the experimental data, a further investigation of this form factor was made by using analyticity and unitarity in a framework known as the method of unitarity bounds [29]. The results for the upper and lower bounds on |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 in the elastic region provided a significant check on those obtained with standard dispersion relations, confirming the existence of a disagreement with experimental data in the q region around 0.6 GeV. Other tests of the consistency of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF with unitarity and analyticity were recently reported in Ref. [30]. A dispersive analysis of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 e/m TFF described in this work used as input the discontinuity provided by unitarity below the \u03c9\u03c0 0 threshold and, for the first time, included experimental data on the modulus measured from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 at higher energies. That analysis also confirmed the discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical calculation of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF in this q region.",

            "text": "Compared to the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, the advantage of measuring \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 would be in giving access to the TFF energy dependence at low momentum transfer, which is important for data-driven approaches calculating the corresponding rare decays and the HLbL contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 . The capability of the A2 experimental setup to measure Dalitz decays was demonstrated in Refs. [16,17] for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3. Measuring \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 with the A2 setup is more challenging because of a much smaller signal, compared to background contributions. Nonresonant contributions, like \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u03b7 final states can cause the same number of electromagnetic showers as the \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 final state. Also, both \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 have their own e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay modes, resulting in e + e \u2212 pairs that can be detected along with \u03c0 0 , if the photon from the former decay is not detected. The \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, which has a branching ratio one order of magnitude larger than that for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3, can mimic the \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 final state when both charged pions deposit their total energy due to nuclear interactions in an electromagnetic calorimeter. Because of the smallness of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 branching ratio, such a problem does not exist for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay. Another decay, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , with a larger branching ratio, cannot mimic an \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 peak with one finalstate photon being undetected. Thus, the background situation requires a more sophisticated analysis for measuring \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 than is needed for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3. To improve the statistical accuracy, two sets of A2 data from 2007 and 2009 were analyzed independently, and their results were combined together. The same technique was tested with \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 events, which have much better statistics and less background, in order to determine the effect on the systematic uncertainty caused by this more sophisticated analysis. Including 2009 data in the present analysis doubled the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 statistics, compared to the previous analysis of only 2007 data [17], and, along with other improvements, resulted in a better accuracy of the A2 results for this Dalitz decay.",

            "text": "The new results for the \u03b7 and \u03c9\u03c0 0 e/m TFFs presented in this paper are based on measuring \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays from a total of 5.87 \u2022 10 7 \u03b7 mesons and 2.27 \u2022 10 7 \u03c9 mesons produced in the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p and \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p reactions, respectively. Previously, the same data sets were used, for instance, in a measurement of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3 decay [31]. In addition to the increase in the experimental statistics, compared to the previous \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 measurements [16,17] by the A2 Collaboration, the present TFF results include systematic uncertainties in every individual data point. This allows a more fair comparison of the data with theoretical calculations, especially those calculations which do not follow the VMD pole approximation, typically used to fit the data in experimental analyses. Data-driven approaches would also prefer data points with total uncertainties, rather than measurements with the systematic uncertainties given only for the slope-parameter values. As in the case of the previous measurements, radiative corrections to the QED differential decay rate of the \u03b7 and \u03c9 Dalitz decays were not taken into account in the present work because their precise magnitude had not been calculated, but possible systematic uncertainties due to those corrections are discussed further in the text.",

Depending on the data-taking period, events with a cluster multiplicity of two were prescaled with different rates. TAPS was not included in the multiplicity trigger for these experiments.

The offline cluster algorithm was optimized for finding a group of adjacent crystals in which the energy was deposited by a single-photon e/m shower. This algorithm works well for e +/\u2212 , which also produce e/m showers in the CB and TAPS, and for proton clusters. The software threshold for the cluster energy was chosen to be 12 MeV. For the \u03b3p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p candidates, the three-cluster events were analyzed assuming that the final-state proton was not detected.

Details of the kinematic-fit parametrization of the detector information and resolu-tions are given in Ref. [40]. Because the three-cluster sample, in which there are good \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p events without the outgoing proton detected, was mostly dominated by \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3p and \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3p events, the corresponding kinematic-fit hypotheses were tested first. Then all events for which the confidence level (CL) to be \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p or \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p was greater than 10 \u22125 were discarded from further analysis. It was checked that such a preselection practically does not cause any losses of \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays (which are < 1%), but rejects a significant background from two-photon final states. Because e/m showers from electrons and positrons are very similar to those of photons, the hypothesis \u03b3p \u2192 3\u03b3p was tested to identify the \u03b3p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p candidates. To identify \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 candidates, two hypotheses, \u03b3p \u2192 4\u03b3p and \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3p \u2192 4\u03b3p, were tested. The events that satisfied these hypotheses with the CL greater than 1% were accepted for further analysis. The kinematic-fit output was used to reconstruct the kinematics of the outgoing particles. In this output, there was no separation between e/m showers caused by the outgoing photon, electron, or positron. Because the main purpose of the experiments was to measure the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decay rates as a function of the invariant mass m(e + e \u2212 ), the next step in the analysis was the separation of e + e \u2212 pairs from final-state photons. This procedure was optimized by using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the processes \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p and \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3e + e \u2212 p.",

To reproduce the experimental yield of \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons and their angular distributions as a function of the incident-photon energy, both the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p and \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p reactions were generated according to the numbers of the corresponding events and their angular distributions measured in the same experiment [41,44]. The \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays were generated according to Eq. (1), with the phase-space term removed and with \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = 1.95 GeV \u22122 from previous experiments [15,17]. The generation of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays were made in two steps. To reproduce the energy dependence of the \u03c9 decay width near the production threshold, the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p was generated first according to phase space. Then, the invariant mass m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) was folded with the Breit-Wigner (BW) function, with the parameters taken for the \u03c9 meson from the Review of Particle Physics (RPP) [45]. This approach allowed one to properly reproduce the folding of the BW shape with phase space. Next, the invariant mass m(e + e \u2212 ) was folded to follow Eq. (3) with \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 = 2.24 GeV \u22122 [15]. The angular dependence of the virtual photon decaying into a lepton pair was generated according to Eq. (2), for both \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 . Possible background processes were also studied by using MC simulations. The reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p was simulated for several other decay modes of the \u03b7 meson to check if they could mimic a peak from the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 signal. Such MC simulations were made for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decays. The yield and the production angular distributions of all \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p simulations were generated in the same way as for the process \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p. In contrast to the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay, all other \u03b7 decays were generated according to phase space. The major background under the peak from \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays was found to be from the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 p. The MC simulation of this reaction was carried out in the same way as reported in Ref. [46]. Although this background is smooth in the region of the \u03b7 mass and cannot mimic an \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 peak, its MC simulation was used to optimize the signalto-background ratio and to parametrize the background under the signal.",

This procedure is optimized with respect to how close the \u03c6 angle of an e/m shower in the CB should be to the correspodning angle of a fired PID element to be considered as e +/\u2212 , and how far it should be to be considered as a photon. This decreases the efficiency in selecting true events for which the \u03c6 angle of the electron or the positron is close to the photon \u03c6 angle.",

According to the MC simulations of these backgrounds, many photons produce energy losses that are significantly smaller than dE/dx from a single e +/\u2212 , and the e + e \u2212 pairs reconstructed as one cluster in the CB result in a double-magnitude PID signal, compared to a single e +/\u2212 .

All PID elements were calibrated so that the e +/\u2212 peak position matched the corresponding peak in the MC simulation. To reproduce the actual energy resolution of the PID with the MC simulation, the GEANT output for PID energies was subject to additional smearing, allowing the e +/\u2212 selection with dE/dx cuts to be very similar for the experimental data and MC.

The suppression of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background to a level negligible for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 events typically requires a combination of a few selection criteria. The energy resolution of the PID is not sufficient to efficiently separate \u03c0 +/\u2212 from e +/\u2212 by the dE/dx method. Most of the background events from \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays have a low probability for \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3p \u2192 4\u03b3p, and the position of the event vertex along the beam direction (z axis), reconstructed by the kinematic fit, is strongly shifted in the downstream direction. Such a shift in z is caused by an attempt by the kinematic fit to compensate for an imbalance in energy conservation by changing significantly the polar angles of the outgoing particles, which is only possible by moving the event vertex along the beam direction. Accordingly, applying cuts on the kinematic-fit CL and the vertex coor-dinate z mostly rejects \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events with cluster energies of \u03c0 +/\u2212 below their total energies. Typically, such events are reconstructed by the kinematic fit with invariant masses m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) below the mass of the \u03c9 meson. Further suppression of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background events remaining in the vicinity of the \u03c9 mass can be achieved by using differences in features of e/m and nuclear-interaction showers in the CB. As observed from MC simulations of \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, nuclear-interaction showers at lower energies typically have a smaller multiplicity of the crystals forming a cluster. At higher energies, nuclear-interaction showers from \u03c0 +/\u2212 typically spread more widely than e/m showers. Such a spread can be evaluated via the cluster effective radius. For the CB, the effective radius R of a cluster containing k crystals with energy E i deposited in \u03b3p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p candidates initially selected with the kinematic fit and allowing both e + and e \u2212 to be identified with the same PID element: (a) MC simulation of \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p fitted with a Gaussian; (b) experimental events (Run-I) after subtracting the random background and the remaining background from \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3p.

In addition to the background contributions from other physical reactions, there are two more background sources. The first source comes from interactions of incident photons in the windows of the target cell. The  subtraction of this background from experimental spectra is typically based on the analysis of data samples that were taken with an empty target. In the present analysis, the empty-target background was small and did not feature any visible \u03b7 peak in its m(e + e \u2212 \u03b3) spectra for the \u03b3p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p candidates nor any \u03c9 peak in its m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) spectra for the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p candidates. Another background was caused by random coincidences of the tagger counts with the experimental trigger; its subtraction was carried out by using event samples for which all coincidences were random (see Refs.

The distribution for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 background is normalized to the number of subtracted events and is shown in the same figure by a red solid line. The subtraction normalization was based on the number of events generated for \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3p and the number of \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p events produced in the same experiment. The experimental distribution was fitted with the sum of a Gaussian for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 peak and a polynomial of order four for the background. In this fit, the centroid and width of the Gaussian were fixed to the values obtained from the previous Gaussian fit to the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p MC simulation, which is shown in Fig. 4(a). As seen, the Gaussian parameters obtained from fitting to the MC simulation suit the experimental peak well. This confirms the agreement of the experimental data and the MC simulation in the energy calibration of the calorimeters and their resolution. The order of the polynomial was chosen to be sufficient for a reasonable description of the background distribution in the range of fitting.

The result of applying the softer cuts on N and R (depicted by red dashed lines in Fig. 3) is demonstrated in Fig. 9, showing a significant improvement in the signal-to-background ratio. The further improvement with the tighter cuts on N and R (depicted by blue solid lines in Fig. 3) is demonstrated in Fig. 10. The fits with the suppressed background in this m(e + e \u2212 ) range are more reliable, even if the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p detection efficiency decreases from 33.4% to 27.8% after applying the softer cuts, and to 24.0% after applying the tighter cuts. It was checked that the results for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 yield obtained with and without cuts on N and R were in good agreement within the fit uncertainties, confirming the reliability of the method based on the difference in the features of e +/\u2212 and \u03c0 +/\u2212 clusters. Note that the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 background is negligibly small in this range of m(e + e \u2212 ) masses, even with both e + and e \u2212 being identified by the same PID elements. Because the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays were analyzed in the same data sets and by using the same cuts, the systematic uncertainties caused by these cuts should be the same as for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3. Additional tests were made for m(e + e \u2212 ) ranges with less background and wide m(e + e \u2212 ) bins, giving smaller statistical uncertainties in the results. The fitting procedure for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 (which is very similar to \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3) and some of the tests, including the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 angular dependence of the virtual photon decaying into a lepton pair, are illustrated in Figs. 11-15. Figure 11 shows \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p candidates selected only with the kinematic-fit CL, for the m(e + e \u2212 ) region below the \u03c0 0 mass, avoiding very large background from \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 p. Figure 11(a) depicts the m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) invariant-mass distribution for the MC simulation of \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p fitted with a Gaussian. The choice of the normal distribution for fitting the \u03c9 peak is motivated by the facts that the BW shape of the \u03c9 signal is severely cut by phase space near threshold and the m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) resolution strongly dominates the \u03c9-meson width (\u0393 = 8.49 MeV [45]). A similar approach was succesfully used for fitting the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 peak above background while measuring \u03c9 photoproduction with the same data set [44]. The experimental distribution after subtracting both the random background and the background remaining from \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decays (with both the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay modes) is shown by crosses in Fig. 11(b). The distribution for the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 background is normalized to the number of subtracted events and is shown in the same figure by a red solid line. The subtraction normalization was based on the number of events generated for \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3p and the number of \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p events produced in the experiment. The experimental distribution was fitted with the sum of a Gaussian for the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 peak and a polynomial of order five for the background. In this fit, the centroid and width of the Gaussian were fixed to the values obtained from the previous Gaussian fit to the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c9p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p MC simulation, which is shown in Fig. 11(a). Similar to \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3, the number of \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays in the MC and experimental m(\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) spectra was determined from the area under the Gaussian. For the selection criteria used to obtain the spectra in Fig. 11 and the given m(e + e \u2212 ) range, the averaged detection efficiency determined for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 is 14.5%. Figure 12 illustrates the impact of the PID dE/dx cut and the softer cuts on N and R on suppressing background under the \u03c9 peak. As seen, compared to Fig. 11(b), the quantity of background events becomes smaller by a factor of 5 (resulting in a more reliable fit to the signal peak), whereas the detection efficiency for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decreases to 9.1%.",

(2). The experimental results for such an angular dependence are illustrated in Fig. 13. Figure 13(a) shows the experimental cos \u03b8 * distribution obtained for the events in the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 peak from Fig. 12(b). The corresponding angular acceptance determined from the MC simulation is depicted in Fig. 13(b). The experimental cos \u03b8 * distribution corrected for the acceptance is depicted in Fig. 13(c), showing, for the very limited statistics and the remaining background, reasonable agreement with the expected 1+cos 2 \u03b8 * dependence. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate fits for the m(e + e \u2212 ) region above the \u03c0 0 mass, with \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 p candidates selected after the tighter cuts on N and R (better suppressing the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background), and without and with dE/dx PID cuts. As seen from these figures, the quantity of background events in the vicinity of the \u03c9 peak becomes smaller by a factor of more than 4 after applying the dE/dx PID cut, whereas the detection efficiency, averaged in this m(e + e \u2212 ) range, decreases from 18.9% to 15.1%. The \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 background is negligibly small in this range of m(e + e \u2212 ) masses, and it is not shown in these figures. The fits made without and with dE/dx PID cuts showed good agreement within the fit uncer-tainties, confirming the reliability of tests made with the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay.",

Values of d\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3)/dm(e + e \u2212 ) and d\u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 )/dm(e + e \u2212 ) for every fit were obtained from those initial numbers of decays by taking into account the full decay width of \u03b7 and \u03c9 [45], the total number of \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons produced in the same data sets [41,44], and the width of the corresponding m(e + e \u2212 ) bin. The uncertainty in an individual d\u0393/dm(e + e \u2212 ) value from a particular fit was based on the uncertainty in the number of decays determined by this fit (i.e, the uncertainty in the area under the Gaussian). The systematic uncertainties in the d\u0393/dm(e + e \u2212 ) value were estimated for each individual m(e + e \u2212 ) bin by repeating its fitting procedure several times after refilling the m(e + e \u2212 \u03b3) spectra with different combinations of selection criteria, which were used to improve the signal-to-background ratio, or after slight changes in the parametrization of the background under the signal peak. The changes in selection criteria included cuts on the kinematic-fit CL (such as 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), different cuts on PID dE/dx, N , R, and z. As in Ref. [17], the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 results were also checked for excluding three-cluster events (no final-state proton detected) from the analysis. The requirement of making several fits for each m(e + e \u2212 ) bin provided a check on the stability of the d\u0393/dm(e + e \u2212 ) results. The average of the results of all fits made for one bin was then used to obtain final d\u0393/dm values that were more reliable than the results based on just one so-called best fit, which was made with a combination of selection criteria, giving the optimal number of events in the sig-which is expected to be \u223c1%.",

The calculation by Terschl\u00fcsen and Leupold (TL) combines the vector-meson Lagrangian proposed in Ref. [47] and recently extended in Ref. [25], with the Wess-Zumino-Witten contact interaction [48]. As seen, the TL calculation lies slightly lower than the pole-approximation fit to the present data points, but is still in good agreement with the data points within their error bars. The calculations by the J\u00fclich group, in which the radiative decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 [49] is connected to the isovector contributions of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 * TFF in a model-independent way, by using dispersion theory, are shown for the latest solution [20], including the a 2 -meson contribution in the analysis. As seen, this solution is very close to the present pole-approximation fit. The calculations by the Mainz group, which are based on a model-independent method using Pad\u00e9 approximants (initially developed for the \u03c0 0 TFF [50]), are shown for both their previous [51] and latest [18] solutions. As seen, both the solutions are very close to the present pole-approximation fit. However, the latest solution, also involving the previous A2 data on the \u03b7 TFF [17], has a much smaller uncertainty. It is expected that adding the |F \u03b7 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 results from this work into the corresponding calculation by the Mainz group will allow an even smaller uncertainty in the value for the slope parameter of the \u03b7 TFF to be obtained.",

Similarly to the comparison of the two individual sets of |F \u03b7 (m \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 )| 2 results and their uncertainties, these experimental results are also plotted twice. The two-parameter fits of the individual |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results with Eq. (4) are shown in Figs. 18(a) and (b), respectively for Run-I and Run-II. As seen in Fig. 18, the experimental statistics for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays in Run-I and Run-II and the level of background resulted in quite large total uncertainties in those |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results, especially at large m(e + e \u2212 ) masses. Within those uncertainties, the |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results from both data sets are in good agreement with each other. The same holds for the fit results for the normalization parameter p0 and the parameter p1, corresponding to \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 . Despite large uncertainties in p1 = (1.96 \u00b1 0.25 tot ) GeV \u22122 obtained for Run-I and in p1 = (2.01 \u00b1 0.28 tot ) GeV \u22122 for Run-II, both results indicate a lower value for \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 than those reported previously by Lepton-G [23] and NA60 [12,15]. At the same time, the comparison of the individual |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 results and their pole-approximation fits, for example, with the two different solutions from the dispersive analysis by the Bonn group [26] indicates no contradiction with these calculations.",

The uncertainty in the \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 value obtained in the present work is similar to that of Lepton-G, but is significantly larger than the accuracy achieved by NA60. Meanwhile, the advantage in measuring the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decay is that the control of the overall normalization of the |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results is much more stringent than in the case of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, which does not enable measurement at low m(\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ). The magnitude of the parameter p0, obtained from the fit to the present |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 results, indicates small values of systematic uncertainties due to the normalization, which depends on the correctness in the reconstruction of both the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decays as well as on radiative corrections for the QED differential decay rate at low q.

This calculation is based on a model-independent method using Canterbury approximants, which are an extension of the Pad\u00e9 theory for bivariate functions [54]. The parameter \u039b is obtained by requiring that the slope of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF in the variable q 2 should be the same as for the \u03c0 0 TFF, taking into account isospin breaking. In the approach used, the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF is considered as the \u03c0 0 TFF of double virtuality, with the virtuality of one of the photons fixed to the \u03c9-meson mass, and the other photon to the invariant mass of the lepton pair. The relatively large uncertainty in this prediction at higher m(\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) is determined by the uncertainty in the \u03c0 0 TFF extrapolated in the region of larger q 2 .",

Including one more \u03c9 i (s) term, with fitting its weight to the data, does not change much for either the NA60 In-In or the present results. Including two additional \u03c9 i (s) terms in the fitting to the NA60 In-In data results in a better agreement with their results, but it is difficult to justify such a strong rise of the inelastic form factor [29]. For the present data, the solution with two additional \u03c9 i (s) terms is very close to the basic calculation, which agrees with the small magnitude expected for higher order terms of the inelastic contributions.",

More measurements of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decay, with much better statistical accuracy, especially at large m(\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) masses, are needed to solve the problem of the inconsistency remaining between the calculations and the experimental data. Once the agreement between the theory and the experiment is established for the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * TFF, or the origin of the potential disagreement is understood, then such data could make an improvement in the theoretical uncertainties, in particular the dispersive model-independent calculations and the Pad\u00e9-approximants method, which could then result in a better determination of the corresponding HLbL contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 .",

It was checked in the present analysis that the correction for the QED energy dependence makes this dependence lower by \u223c10% at the largest q measured. However, because the radiative corrections suppress the decay amplitude at extreme cos \u03b8 * , taken together with the lower acceptance for those angles, the detection efficiency improves at large q. This partially compensates the impact from using lower QED values for measuring TFFs at large q.",

The value obtained for the slope parameter of the \u03b7 e/m TFF, \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 = (1.97 \u00b1 0.11 tot ) GeV \u22122 , is in good agreement with previous measurements of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 decays, and the |F \u03b7 | 2 results are in good agreement with recent theoretical calculations. The uncertainty obtained in the value of \u039b \u22122 \u03b7 is lower than in previous results based on the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay and the NA60 result based on \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 decays from peripheral In-In collisions. The value obtained for \u03c9, \u039b \u22122 \u03c9\u03c0 0 = (1.99 \u00b1 0.21 tot ) GeV \u22122 , is somewhat lower than previous measurements based on the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay. The results of this work for |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 | 2 are in better agreement with theoretical calculations than the data from earlier experiments.

            "text": "The individual |F \u03b7 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 results from Run-I and Run-II are compared in Fig. 16. For a better comparison of the magnitudes of total uncertainties in both the measurements, with the same m(e + e \u2212 ) binning, the experimental results are plotted twice. In Fig. 16(a), the error bars of Run-I are plotted on the top of the error bars of Run-II, and the other way around in Fig. 16(b). Correspondingly, the fit to the |F \u03b7 | 2 results of Run-I with Eq. (4) is shown in Fig. 16(a), and of Run-II in Fig. 16(b). The fits are made with two free parameters, one of which, p1, is \u039b \u22122 , and the other, p0, reflects the general normalization of the data points. For example, the latter parameter could be different from p0 = 1 because of the uncertainty in the determination of the experimental number of \u03b7 mesons produced. Another possible reason for p0 to be slightly more than one is radiative corrections for the QED differential decay rate at low q, the magnitude of  results (black filled triangles) combined from Run-I and Run-II and their poleapproximation fit (black solid line, with p0 and p1 being the normalization and the slope parameter \u039b \u22122 , respectively) are compared to previous measurements and various theoretical calculations. The former results by the A2 Collaboration from Ref. [17] (open magenta circles) and Ref. [16] (open green diamonds) are shown in panel (a). The results of NA60 obtained in peripheral In-In data [15] and in p-A collisions [12] are shown in panel (b). The calculation from Ref. [48] is shown in (a) by a blue dash-dotted line. The most recent DA calculation by the J\u00fclich group [20] is shown in (b) by a blue dashed line. The calculations by the Mainz group with Pad\u00e9 approximants are shown in (a) for their previous solution [51] (red dashed line with an error band) and in (b) for their latest solution [18] (red dotted line with an error band).     with each other and with the two solutions for the DA calculations by the Bonn group [26] shown by error-band borders. The solution using a simplified, VMD-inspired \u03c9 \u2192 3\u03c0 partial wave f1(s) = \u03b1\u2126(s) inside the dispersion integral is shown by cyan dashed lines, and the solution using the full rescattering of 3\u03c0 by magenta dashed lines. The pole-approximation fits (black solid lines) to the results of Run-I and Run-II are depicted in panels (a) and (b), respectively. The fit parameter p0 reflects the general normalization of the data points, and p1 is the slope parameter \u039b \u22122 . For a better comparison of the magnitudes of total uncertainties from the two data sets, the error bars of Run-I are plotted in (a) on the top of the error bars of Run-II, and the other way around in (b).    The calculation from Refs. [24,25] is shown by a red dash-dotted line in (a). The DA calculation by the Bonn group [26] for the full 3\u03c0 rescattering is shown by error-band borders (magenta dashed lines) in (b). Upper and lower bounds by Caprini [30] are shown by cyan dashed lines for two cases of the discontinuity calculated with the partial-wave amplitude f1(t) based on the improved N/D model [52] (a), and taken from Ref. [26] (b). The calculation based on a model-independent method using Canterbury approximants [53] is shown by a magenta long-dashed line with a gray error band. The basic calculation (blue dashed line) from JPAC [27] and the effect from including higher order terms of the inelastic contributions in the \u03c9\u03c0 0 TFF by fitting them to the NA60 In-In data is shown in (c) for the solutions with adding one (black dotted line) and two (red dash-dotted line) terms. A similar effect from including higher order terms by fitting them to the present |F \u03c9\u03c0 0 (m \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 )| 2 results is shown in (c) for the solutions with one (magenta long-dashed line) and with two (cyan dash-double-dotted line) terms.",
