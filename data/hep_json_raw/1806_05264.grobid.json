The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The search uses the M T2 variable, which generalises the transverse mass for systems with two invisible objects and provides a discrimination against standard model backgrounds containing W bosons. The observed yields are consistent with the expectations from the standard model. The search is interpreted in the context of simplified SUSY models and probes slepton masses up to approximately 290, 400, and 450 GeV, assuming right-handed only, left-handed only, and both right-and left-handed sleptons (mass degenerate selectrons and smuons), and a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. Limits are also set on selectrons and smuons separately. These limits show an improvement on the existing limits of approximately 150 GeV.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics provides a description of the fundamental particles and their interactions, and its predictions have been confirmed experimentally with increasing precision over the last several decades. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], one of the most promising extensions of the SM, addresses several open questions for which the SM has no answer, such as the hierarchy problem and the origin of dark matter. The theory postulates a new fundamental symmetry that assigns to each SM particle a SUSY partner whose spin differs by one half, causing the SUSY partner of an SM fermion (boson) to be a boson (fermion). In addition to stabilising the Higgs boson (H) mass via cancellations between quantum loop corrections including the top quark and its superpartner, SUSY provides a natural dark matter candidate, if R-parity [9] is conserved, in the form of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), which is assumed to be massive and stable.",

At sufficiently heavy slepton masses, the sleptons undergo a two-body decay into one of the heavier neutralinos or a chargino, while direct decays to a neutralino LSP are favoured for light slepton masses. This Letter presents a search for directly produced selectrons and smuons ( e L , \u03bc L , e R , \u03bc R ), under the assumption of direct decays \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 with 100% branching ratio, as sketched in Fig. 1. The final state contains little or no hadronic activity and provides a clean signature composed of two opposite-charge (OC), same-flavour (SF) leptons (dielectron or dimuon pairs) and large missing transverse momentum (p miss T ) from the two LSPs that escape detection. The main SM backgrounds resulting in two OC SF leptons and no reconstructed jets are pp \u2192 tt (if both jets from the top decays are out of acceptance) and pp \u2192 WW \u2192 2 2\u03bd, both of which involve W bosons that decay into an electron or a muon with equal probability, resulting in the same number of dielectron and dimuon events as electron-muon events (different flavour, DF). This flavour symmetry is used in the analysis to predict the number of background SF leptons based on the number of DF leptons in the signal region (SR) in data, after correcting for differences in trigger and lepton reconstruction efficiencies. The Drell-Yan (DY) process would also be a main background in the analysis, but is greatly suppressed by the SR requirements. The pp \u2192 ZZ \u2192 2 2\u03bd and pp \u2192 WZ \u2192 3 \u03bd processes can also result in two OC SF leptons.",

The SF and DF samples are collected with a variety of isolated and non-isolated dilepton triggers. Triggers that include loose isolation criteria on both leptons require p T > 23 GeV (electron) or 17 GeV (muon) on the highest p T lepton. The other lepton is then required to have p T > 12 GeV (electrons) or 8 GeV (muons). In addition, dilepton triggers without isolation requirements are used to increase the signal efficiency. These require p T > 33 (30) GeV for both leptons in the dielectron (electron-muon) case. The dimuon trigger requires either p T > 27 (8) GeV for the highest (next-to-highest) p T muon during early data taking periods, with an increase of the thresholds to p T > 30 (11) GeV for the highest (next-to-highest) p T muon during remaining data taking periods. The data collected with these triggers are used for the data-driven background prediction as well as to collect the events in the SR with a higher leading lepton p T requirement of 50 GeV. The lepton pseudorapidity coverage for the triggers is |\u03b7| < 2.5 (2.4) for electrons (muons).

Simulated samples of DY processes are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.3.3 program [17] to leading order precision with up to four additional partons in the matrix element calculation. Simulated VVV and ttV (V = W, Z) events are simulated with the same generator but at NLO precision. The NNPDF3.0 [37] LO (NLO) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for the samples generated at LO (NLO). The matrix element calculations performed with these generators are interfaced with pythia [38], including the CUETP8M1 tune [39,40] for the simulation of parton showering and hadronisation. Double counting of partons generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo and pythia is removed using the MLM [41] and FxFx [42] matching schemes in the LO and NLO samples, respectively. The detector response is simulated with a Geant4 model [43] of the CMS detector. The simulation of newphysics signals is performed using the MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 program at LO precision, with up to two additional partons in the matrix element calculation. Events are then interfaced with pythia for fragmentation and hadronisation and simulated using the CMS fast simulation package [44]. The slepton decays are also simulated with pythia. Multiple pp interactions, also known as pileup, are superimposed on the hard collision, and the simulated samples are reweighed in such a way that the number of collisions per bunch crossing accurately reflects the distribution observed in data. Corrections are applied to the simulated samples to account for differences between simulation and data in the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies.",

They are identified using a multivariate approach based on information on ECAL cluster shapes, track reconstruction quality, and the matching between the track and the ECAL cluster [48]. Electrons coming from reconstructed photon conversions are rejected. Muons are reconstructed from tracks in the muon system associated with tracks in the tracker. The identification uses the quality of the track fit and the number of associated hits in the tracking detectors [49]. For both electrons and muons, the impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex is required to be within 0.5 mm in the transverse plane and less than 1 mm along the beam direction. A lepton isolation variable is defined as the scalar p T sum of all PF objects in a cone around the lepton, excluding identified electrons or muons. The effect of additional pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can be mitigated by only considering charged PF objects that are compatible with the primary vertex and the per-event average expected pileup contribution is subtracted from the neutral component of the isolation. The isolation sum is required to be smaller than 10 (20)% of the electron (muon) p T . A shrinking cone-size with increasing p T is chosen that ensures high efficiency for leptons from Lorentz-boosted boson decays [50]. This varying cone size is chosen as the following R = ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 = 0.2 for p T < 50 GeV, = 10 GeV/p T for 50 < p T < 200 GeV, and 0.05 for p T > 200 GeV. Jets are clustered from PF objects, excluding charged hadrons not associated with the primary vertex that are assumed to be the result of pileup interactions, using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [46] with a distance parameter of 0.4 as implemented in the FastJet package [47,51]. Jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 25 GeV, where the p T is corrected for non-uniform detector response and pileup effects [52,53]. Jets reconstructed within R < 0.4 of any of the selected leptons are removed from the event. Corrections to the jet energy are propagated to p miss T using the procedure developed in Ref. [52]. At least two jets of p T above 35 GeV are selected for CRs of this analysis, and events are vetoed that contain jets with p T above 25 GeV in the SR.",

The translation factor R SF/DF is measured, similarly to the R ee/DF and R \u03bc\u03bc/DF , as the rate of SF events to DF events in a dedicated CR. Another method to estimate the SF yields is measuring the difference for electrons and muons in reconstruction, identification and trigger efficiencies. As the second method uses information of both electrons and muons, it cannot be used for the estimation of the R ee/DF and R \u03bc\u03bc/DF . However, it is combined with the results from the initial measurement of R SF/DF using the weighted average according to their uncertainties as described in Ref.

The first method estimates directly the translation factors R ee/DF , R \u03bc\u03bc/DF and R SF/DF in a data CR enriched in tt events, requiring exactly two jets, 100 < p miss T < 150 GeV, and excluding the dilepton invariant mass range 70 < m < 110 GeV to reduce contributions from DY production.

Data and simulation agree within 2% in this region. A 4% systematic uncertainty on the translation factor is assigned from simulation studies, as the maximal magnitude of the systematic needed to cover discrepancies in the translation factor as a function of some SR variables. The main SF backgrounds estimated with the method described above are tt and WW. Simulation studies show that the WW is the dominating FS process at high p miss T and that there is no dependence on the R SF/DF , R ee/DF and R \u03bc\u03bc/DF factors arising from the different processes.",

The uncertainty on the trigger efficiency is measured to be 3%, as described in Section 6.1. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale is assessed by shifting the jet energy correction factors for each jet by one standard deviation up and down and recalculating the kinematic quantities. The result varies between 1 and 16% depending on the signal kinematics. The uncertainty due to the simulation of pileup for simulated background processes is taken into account by varying the expected cross section of inelastic collisions by 5% [65], and amounts to 0.5-7% depending on the signal scenario. Varying the unclustered energy, and the electron and muon scales, up and down by their 1\u03c3 variations and evaluating the effect on the p miss T , results in systematic uncertainties of 0.5-8%, 0.5-4%, and 0.5-20% respectively. The large variation associated to the muon energy scale is due to the poor muon momentum resolution at high p T , and the quoted value is driven by one signal scenario containing such high p T muon events. The theoretical uncertainties are those related to the uncertainty on the QCD renormalisation (\u03bc R ) and factorisation (\u03bc F ) scales, and of the PDF. The systematic uncertainties associated with the \u03bc R and \u03bc F scales are evaluated using weights derived from the SysCalc code applied to simulated signal events [66]. For renormalisation and factorisation scales the Stewart-Tackmann prescription [67] is followed, that treats the theory uncertainties in analyses with a jet selection. This procedure results in an uncertainty of 1-11%. Finally the statistical uncertainty in the number of simulated events is also considered and found to be in the range 0.5-20%, depending on the signal scenario.",

Similarly, the limits on direct selectron and smuon production are displayed in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The Figs. 5-7 also show the 95% CL exclusion contours, as a function of the and \u03c7 0 1 masses. Note that the cross section at a given mass for right-handed sleptons is expected to be about one third of that for left-handed sleptons. The analysis probes slepton masses up to approximately 450, 400, or 290 GeV, assuming both left-and right-handed, lefthanded only, or right-handed sleptons, and a massless LSP. For models with high slepton masses and light LSPs the sensitivity is driven by the highest p miss T bin. The sensitivity is reduced at higher LSP masses due to the effect of the lepton acceptance. In the case of selectrons (smuons), the limits corresponding to these 3 scenarios are 350, 310 and 250 GeV (310, 280, and 210 GeV). Since the dimuon data yield in the highest p miss T bin is somewhat higher than predicted, the observed limits in this channel are weaker than expected in the absence of signal. These results improve the previous 8 TeV exclusion limits by 100-150 GeV in the slepton mass [13]. ",

Cross section upper limit and exclusion contours at 95% CL for direct selectron production as a function of the \u03c7 0 1 and masses, assuming the production of both leftand right-handed selectrons (upper), or production of only left-(lower left) or right-handed (lower right) selectrons. The region under the thick red dotted (black solid) line is excluded by the expected (observed) limit. The thin red dotted curves indicate the regions containing 95% of the distribution of limits expected under the background-only hypothesis. For the right-handed selectrons, only the +1\u03c3 expected line (thin red dotted curve) is shown as no exclusion can be made at \u22121\u03c3 . The thin solid black curves show the change in the observed limit due to variation of the signal cross sections within their theoretical uncertainties.",
