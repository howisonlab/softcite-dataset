This means processes with signal cross sections of a few 10 fb or more, with clear and fairly simple signatures -precision comparison of data to Standard Model tails will take longer, needing more luminosity and very good understanding of detector calibrations, resolutions and trigger efficiencies. The approach I take here is signature rather than model based, but examples of models will be given.",

This is not just \"any old\" new energy regime either. It will give us the first direct look at physics far above the electroweaksymmetry-breaking scale. Thus if the Standard Model (SM) is treated as a Higgsless low-energy effective theory, calculations of SM cross sections violate unitarity within the experimental reach of the experiments. Thus the experiments must see either the SM Higgs, or other new physics, or both. This underlines the need for the experiments to be alert to the widest range of possible exotic signatures. In this brief review I discuss prospects for observing some of these signatures with early data, and to which models they are sensitive.",

The CMS collaboration has recently [1] presented a sensitivity study of \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 resonances above the Drell-Yan background. Such signals can arise for example from Z \u2032 bosons present in grand unification models [2]. With as little as 0.1 fb \u22121 there is sensitivity to a 1 TeV Z \u2032 in all the models considered, even when a realistic estimate of the detector alignment achievable with this luminosity is included. With 1 fb \u22121 there is still sensitivity up to around 2.5 TeV, dependent upon the specific modelsee Fig. 1 (left). Such studies also give an indication of sensitivity to graviton resonances in Randall-Sundrum models, for example. One might begin to distinguish spin-1 from spin-2 resonances with 50 fb \u22121 . Graviton resonances are an example where one also expects to see resonances in the diphoton channel. Here the CMS experiment expects [1,3] to have sensitivity up to around 3.5 TeV with 10 fb \u22121 .",

The major limitation on the sensitivity is likely to be from systematic errors at first associated with detector, where understanding the energy measurement for jets of several TeV will require much detailed study. In the end, as the detectors become better understood, theoretical uncertainties on the QCD cross section will also play a role. That said, both these effects can be reduced by considering the ratio of jets in different rapidity regions. In this case, a CMS study [1] indicates that the dijet mass ratios could be measured up to 6.5 TeV with an accuracy of better than 50%, giving sensitivity to new physics above 15 TeV if the effects are manifested as effective contact interactions.",

The boost means that the decay products will often appear in a single jet. Thus measuring the singlejet mass, and studying substructure of the jet for signs of the heavy particle decay, provides information which can be exploited in the search for and diagnosis of new physics. This was first studied in the case of vector boson scattering at high masses [10] and has since been proposed and/or studied in several other cases [11,12,13,14,15,16], including new physics searches ranging from superheavy quarks to Kaluza-Klein graviton excitations, as well as supersymmetric decay chains and SM measurements. Preliminary studies from ATLAS show that single-jet mass resolutions of a few GeV should be obtainable, which is good enough to make the method useful.

I have not discussed at all the enormous complexity of the detectors and the huge challenges involved in understanding them, and in understanding the SM at 14 TeV. The first things we see will be features of new detectors -so buyer beware rumours and blogs! Nevertheless, there will be some really exciting physics.",
