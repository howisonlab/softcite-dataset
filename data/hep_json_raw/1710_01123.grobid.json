No evidence of such heavy resonances is found. In the search for production via the quark-antiquark annihilation or gluongluon fusion process, upper limits on \u03c3 X \u00d7 B(X \u2192 W W ) as a function of the resonance mass are obtained in the mass range between 200 GeV and up to 5 TeV for various benchmark models: a Higgs-like scalar in different width scenarios, a two-Higgs-doublet model, a heavy vector triplet model, and a warped extra dimensions model. In the vector-boson fusion process, constraints are also obtained on these resonances, as well as on a Higgs boson in the Georgi-Machacek model and a heavy tensor particle coupling only to gauge bosons.",

Nevertheless, the SM is thought to be an incomplete theory and many scenarios beyond the SM (BSM) predict an extended Higgs sector [7,8]. Diboson vector and tensor resonances are also predicted in several other extensions to the SM, such as in composite Higgs models [9,10] and models with warped extra dimensions [11][12][13][14].",

For the case of a scalar resonance produced by gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) or vector-boson fusion (VBF), two scenarios with different intrinsic widths are considered. Constraints on the heavy neutral scalar in two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) are also obtained. The neutral member of the fiveplet in the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model [15,16] also serves as a reference model in the VBF production mode. The parameterisation of heavy vector triplet (HVT) Lagrangians [17,18] permits the interpretation of searches for spin-1 resonances in a generic way. The bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [11,19] features a spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton excitation (G KK ) decaying into W W , while a tensor resonance signal in the VBF production mode is based on an effective Lagrangian model (ELM) [20].",

A search for heavy resonances in the RS models in the leptonic decays of the W W channel, using a dataset of 4.7 fb \u22121 at 7 TeV [23], was reported by the ATLAS Collaboration. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have obtained constraints on the HVT and bulk RS models, based on other decay modes of the V V channels, with V being either a W or a Z boson [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. The search in the e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd decay mode is complementary to searches performed in other decay modes.

This is referred to as the narrow-width approximation (NWA). Larger widths (large-width assumption, LWA) of 5, 10 and 15% of the heavy Higgs boson mass, are also considered. The choice of the width range for the heavy Higgs boson is motivated by the fact that, for several of the most relevant BSM models, widths above 15% are already excluded by indirect limits [37].",

The physical states include a fermiophobic fiveplet, H 0 5 , H \u00b1 5 , and H \u00b1\u00b1 5 , of custodial SU(2) symmetry which couples preferentially to vector bosons [41]. For that reason, the GM model is less constrained [42], when produced by the VBF process, than other standard benchmark models of a triplet Higgs field, such as the little Higgs model [43] or the left-right symmetric model [44]. The model has many parameters [45,46], but, if the other new Higgs bosons are heavier than those of the H 5 multiplet, the only production mode is via the VBF process.

A more precise calculation of higher jet multiplicities is provided by using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3.2 to simulate gg \u2192 H events in association with up to two jets at NLO precision. Here, the overlap between identical final states generated at the matrix element (ME) and the parton shower (PS) stage is removed using FxFx merging [61]. The fraction of ggF events passing the event selection requirements of the N jet = 1 and N jet \u2265 2 VBF categories (defined later in Sect. 6) predicted by the Powheg-Box event generator is reweighted to match that of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO FxFx samples. The corresponding scale factors are calculated for several hypothetical heavy Higgs boson masses. It is the largest, 1.14, for the 200 GeV mass point, and decreases with increasing res-onance mass to a value of 0.85 for the 4 TeV mass point, for the N jet = 1 VBF category. The corresponding numbers are 0.91 and 0.73 for the N jet \u2265 2 VBF category.",

The h damp parameter controls the ME/PS matching and effectively regulates the highp T radiation.

Diboson samples were generated with Sherpa 2.1.1 [71][72][73][74][75] for the gg production processes and Sherpa 2.2.1 for the qq production processes, using the CT10 NLO and NNPDF30NNLO PDF sets, respectively. The Sherpa event generator for the latter processes produces up to one additional parton at NLO and up to three additional partons at LO. Production of W and Z bosons in association with jets was also simulated using Sherpa 2.1.1 with the CT10 NLO PDF set, where b-and c-quarks are treated as massive particles. The gg \u2192 W W production also includes the contribution of the SM Higgs boson at 125 GeV and the interference effects between the continuum and Higgs resonance processes.

The separation of signal from background based on the \u03b7 distribution is found to have a reasonable efficiency and allows, at the same time, a control region to be defined for the W W background (Sect. 7.2).

Other systematic uncertainties such as those associated with trigger efficiencies, lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies, lepton momentum scales and resolutions [78,80], missing transverse momentum reconstruction [89] and the jet vertex tagger [86] are also considered when evaluating systematic effects on the shape and normalisation of the background, or the shape and efficiency of the signal yield. The uncertainty associated with the pile-up modelling is assessed by performing a variation of \u00b19% in the number of simulated pile-up interactions to cover the uncertainty in the ratio of the predicted and measured cross sections of non-diffractive inelastic events producing a hadronic system of mass m X,had > 13 GeV [95].",

The corresponding uncertainties for ggF-induced signals increase from 1.3 to 3.1%, from 13 to 28%, and from 2.3 to 15% for increasing resonance masses in the quasi-inclusive ggF, N jet = 1 and N jet \u2265 2 VBF categories, respectively. The uncertainties for VBF-induced signals increase from 4.3 to 19%, from 5.1 to 9.0%, and from 3.3 to 8.0% in the three categories.",

The background compositions depend strongly on the event categories: the top-quark and W W processes are comparable in SR ggF and SR VBF1J while the top-quark events dominate in SR VBF2J . The large reduction of the total background uncertainty is due to strong anti-correlations between some of the uncertainty sources of the top-quark and W W background. The m T distributions in SR ggF , SR VBF1J and SR VBF2J are shown in Fig. 4.

The numerator depends on the values\u03b8 \u03bc that maximise L for a given value of \u03bc. Limits are obtained separately for ggF and VBF production for the NWA and LWA signal hypotheses. To derive the expected limits on the ggF (VBF) production modes, the VBF (ggF) production cross section is set to zero so that the  expected limits correspond to the background-only hypothesis. To derive the observed limits on the ggF (VBF) production mode, the VBF (ggF) production cross section is treated as a nuisance parameter in the fit and profiled, in the same way as dealing with the normalisation factors of the different background processes. This approach avoids making any assumption about the presence or absence of the signal in any of these production modes. The main systematic uncertainties affecting the limits are the p T correction for the leading lepton in the top-quark background, scale variations for the top-quark background, the parton shower modelling of the W W MC generator, and the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties. Limits are consistent with those expected in the absence of a signal over the investigated mass range. The fact that the observed limits are more stringent than the expected ones for mass values beyond 2 TeV is explained by the deficit in data at the high m T tail in Fig. 4. These limits are extracted using the asymptotic approximation and their accuracy is verified to be consistent within about 5% at 800 GeV and better than 20% at 2 TeV and beyond using pseudo-experiments.",

In addition, the selection thresholds imposed on m and p ,(sub)lead T are relaxed to 10 and 25 GeV, respectively, and the selection on | \u03b7 | and max(m W T ) is removed. The threshold value on m of 10 GeV is used to suppress background contributions from low-mass resonances decaying into different-flavour final states via \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . In this control region, the purity of the top-quark background is 96%, and no mis-modelling of the p ,lead T distribution is observed. The post-fit normalisation factors from the simultaneous fit are 0.96 \u00b1 0.05 and 1.12 +0.13",

No significant excess of events beyond the Standard Model background prediction is found in the mass range between 200 GeV and up to 5 TeV. Upper lim-its are set on the product of the production cross section and the X \u2192 W W branching fraction in several scenarios: a high-mass Higgs boson with a narrow width or with intermediate widths (of 5, 10 and 15% of the heavy Higgs boson mass), as well as other spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 signals. For the narrow-width heavy Higgs boson signals, values above 6.4 pb at m H = 200 GeV and above 0.008 pb at 4 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for the gluon-gluon fusion production mode. The corresponding values for the vector-boson fusion production modes are 1.3 pb and 0.006 pb at 200 GeV and 3 TeV, respectively. For the signals of the heavy vector triplet model A produced by quark-antiquark annihilation and of the Randall-Sundrum graviton model with k/M Pl = 1 and 0.5, mass values below 1.3, 1.1 TeV and 750 GeV are excluded, respectively. of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
