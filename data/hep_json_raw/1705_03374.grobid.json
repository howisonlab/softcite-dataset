Events are selected in which a bhadron is reconstructed in a decay channel containing J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5, and a second b-hadron is reconstructed in a decay channel containing a muon. Results are presented in a fiducial volume defined by kinematic requirements on three muons based on those used in the analysis. The fiducial cross section is measured to be 17.7 \u00b1 0.1(stat.) \u00b1 2.0(syst.) nb. A number of normalised differential cross sections are also measured, and compared to predictions from the Pythia8, Herwig++, MadGraph5 aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and Sherpa event generators, providing new constraints on heavy flavour production.",

The mass of the b-quark introduces an additional scale, and the typical factorisation of QCD calculations into parton distribution functions, hard matrix element and softer parton shower components allows this mass to be introduced at different stages. Furthermore, there are JHEP11(2017)062 several possible schemes for the inclusion of the heavy-quark masses at these various stages and, given this freedom, the optimal settings must be determined by comparisons to data.",

            "text": "Several techniques have previously been used to measure heavy-flavour production. Some measurements rely on identifying hadronic jets containing a b-hadron 1 based on the presence of a decay vertex or charged-particle tracks displaced from the primary interaction vertex due to the lifetime of the b-hadron. These measurements have been performed inclusively [1][2][3][4] and in the associated production of a vector boson (V ) and jets [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. Other classes of measurements identify semileptonic b-hadron decays through the presence of an electron or muon [15][16][17][18][19][20]. Finally, several measurements identify displaced decay vertices without any jet requirements [21,22], or select specific decay channels such as B \u00b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X [23][24][25][26][27][28][29].",

Specifically, the region of small-angle bb pair production is particularly sensitive to the details of the various calculations, but so far remains only loosely constrained by the experimental data. Understanding this region, and heavy-flavour production more generally, is also increasingly relevant at the LHC where, for example, searches for the Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson (V H) and decaying to a bb pair rely extensively on the modelling of one of the main backgrounds: QCD production of bb pairs in association with vector bosons. These searches are most sensitive when the Higgs boson has significant momentum and the resulting b-quarks are produced at small opening angles, so constraining the theoretical predictions for the background in this region is an important input to these searches.",

Two additional qualitative cross-checks on the modelling of the fake muon component are performed by considering data control regions with requirements orthogonal to those of the signal region such that they are expected to contain more fake muons. The first control region is defined by reversing the pile-up rejection requirement so that the probability of a charged pion or kaon faking a third muon increases. The second control region looking at JHEP11(2017)062 prompt dimuon events is defined by reversing the pseudo-proper decay time requirement where the fraction of J/\u03c8 production via weak decays is reduced, and the fraction of events containing a charged pion or kaon faking a third muon is increased. The fits in these control regions are performed inclusively as there is insufficient data to split into differential bins. The third-muon fit procedure is the same as described above except that no pile-up template is used in the pile-up control region. In both control regions, the fit behaves as expected, giving a good description of the data and returning a higher fraction of fake muons.",

The production fraction of B c [47] and branching fraction [31] of B c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u00b5 + X mean that this background is expected to be very small and, in the absence of an identifiable signal in the data, the estimate is taken directly from simulation.

In the case where the c-hadron is produced in the decay of a b-hadron, these muons are counted as part of the signal, but all other c-hadrons are considered as a source of background muons. This population of events is again expected to be small, as it requires a displaced J/\u03c8 produced in a b-hadron decay, as well as a separate c-hadron; production modes include separate g \u2192 bb and g \u2192 cc splittings in the same hard scatter, or double parton scattering producing bb + cc + X in a single proton-proton collision. To determine the rate of such events in data, it is possible to use the third-muon S d 0 fits: c-hadrons have shorter lifetimes than b-hadrons, producing a narrower S d 0 distribution. However, the contribution is found to be so small that it is not possible to reliably extract the c-hadron background with the number of events available in each fit. Instead the rate is derived from simulation, where it is found that approximately 5% of all third muons passing the selection originate from this source of background. To derive a correction for each bin of the measured kinematic distributions, the rate of b+c-hadron production is derived separately from Pythia8 and Herwig++ simulation, two event generators which have different models of the parton shower, underlying event and double parton scattering, and the average of these is used to remove the expected contribution from the fitted number of signal events.",

Pseudo-templates are created by randomly sampling from the default templates, and the fit repeated using each of the modified pseudo-templates. This procedure provides a distribution of results for the extracted signal muon yield, and this distribution is fitted with a Gaussian function, the width of which is taken as a systematic uncertainty from the statistical fluctuations of the templates. The uncertainty is typically at the level of 1-2%. The shapes of the templates derived from simulation are found to have minimal dependence on the physics modelling in the simulation, due to the similar lifetimes of all b-hadrons and the very weak kinematic dependence of S d 0 , so no additional systematic uncertainty was required.",

It would be possible to remove this double-counting by creating a four-dimensional fit but the complexity and lack of stability in such a fit make this very impractical and, since the level of double counting is very small, this is not necessary. Instead, each kinematic bin can be corrected by determining the number of fake J/\u03c8 events that are due to pile-up and removing that from the number of fake J/\u03c8 events extracted from the fit. The number of fake J/\u03c8 events that are due to pile-up is determined by fitting the \u2206z 0 distribution of events JHEP11(2017)062 outside the signal mass window. Approximately 2% of fake J/\u03c8 events are found to be from pile-up events and the fake J/\u03c8 contribution is of order 10% of the selected data, therefore the signal yield is typically altered by 0.2%, but varies depending on the kinematic region.",

To assess the robustness of the simulation of the fake muon background, the templates used in the third muon fits are systematically altered. The BDT response is subtly different for pions and kaons but, due to the limited number of fake muon candidates in simulation, the two sources of fake muons are combined. The ratio of pions to kaons populating the fake muon templates is changed by \u00b150% to cover any effect of the combination. In addition, the fraction of pions and kaons decaying inside and outside the inner detector is varied by \u00b150%. Finally the ratio of DIF muons and hadronic leakage muons in the fake muon template is changed by \u00b150%. The BDT response is different for the two types of fake muons but the available number of simulated events do not allow separation of the two contributions in the template which is composed of approximately 75% DIF muons. The fractional composition of the fake muon template is changed to cover any mismodelling in simulation of the composition of the two sources of fake muons.

A pile-up region is defined by reversing the |\u2206z 0 | requirements, and a fake J/\u03c8 region is formed by selecting for events outside the dimuon mass window. The third-muon BDT distribution in these events is fitted with the usual simulation-derived BDT templates for real and fake muons. The fitted real component is then subtracted from data, leaving an estimate of the BDT template for fake muons. Due to statistical limitations, this process can only be performed on the inclusive data set and not differentially. This data-driven template is then used instead of the simulation-derived fake muon templates for each differential fit. The difference with respect to the usual result is then used to form the systematic uncertainty. The envelope from the largest deviation in each bin from either the pile-up or fake J/\u03c8 derived template is assigned as a systematic uncertainty in the modelling of fake muons in simulation.

To get around this problem, a set of transfer functions are derived, which can be used to translate the predictions for a less computationally intensive inclusive two-b-hadron final state into the desired three-muon final state.

The dependence of the \u2206R(b-hadron,b-hadron) distribution on the definition of the two-b-hadron fiducial volume is studied using the Pythia8 and Herwig++ event generators described in section 7, and based on requiring two b-hadrons with a minimum p T requirement and within a defined rapidity region. The dependence on the rapidity requirement was found to be small, so |y| < 2.4 was chosen for both b-hadrons as it lies between the \u03b7 requirements on muons in the three-muon selection.

While no choice of value for a simple scaling parameter gives good agreement across all p T and mass values, a scaling factor of 1.75 provides a reasonable compromise. This scaling is only used for mass and p T . The two-b-hadron fiducial volume is therefore defined by requiring two weakly decaying b-hadrons with p T > 15.5 GeV and |y| < 2.4.

First, the proportion of signal relative to background is enhanced by requiring \u03c4 > 0.25 mm/c. The remaining contribution from certain backgrounds is determined from the J/\u03c8 fit, and other backgrounds are determined using a simultaneous fit to the transverse impact parameter significance, S d 0 , and the output of a boosted decision tree (BDT) trained to separate signal muons from misreconstructed muons, as described in section 5.2. The transverse impact parameter significance is defined asS d 0 \u2261 d 0 /\u03c3 d 0 , (5.2)where the transverse impact parameter, d 0 , is the distance of closest approach of the track to the primary vertex point in the r-\u03c6 projection, with the d 0 sign given by the sign of the angular momentum of the track around the beam evaluated at the point of closest approach; and \u03c3 d 0 is the (unsigned) uncertainty in the reconstructed d 0 .3. Some remaining irreducible sources of background are then subtracted from the fitted yields, as described in section 5.3.4.Having determined the yield of J/\u03c8 and third muons, this is corrected for the effect of the \u03c4 requirement (\u03c4 > 0.25 mm/c), as described in section 5.4.5. Finally, the effects of detector resolution are corrected for, as described in section 5.5, determining the measured cross section for the signal.",
