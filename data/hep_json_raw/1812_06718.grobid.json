At the LHC, one can use these models for dark matter searches. One of the possible approaches for the search of these models is by considering the decay of the spin-0 particle to a pair of tt, thus modifying the pattern of the top quark pair invariant mass spectrum. This search suggests a good sensitivity in a parameter space different than the more traditional searches. We examine this sensitivity and put limits on two benchmark models containing candidates for dark matter, using previous ATLAS results. It was found that when the mediator mass (m Y 0 ) and the dark matter candidate mass (m \u03c7 ) have values of m Y 0 \u223c 2\u2022m \u03c7 , mediator masses in the range of [400, 600] GeV are excluded. We compare our results to direct detection experiments and show that we gain sensitivity for new regions which are not covered by other searches.",

Although the conclusions of a given analysis are broader than the benchmark model used, in most of the cases, the analysis aims to maximise the sensitivity for this specific model. As general as the model is, parameter spaces of other models containing DM candidates are not necessarily covered. A complementary search for these models can be achieved if the mediator decays to a pair of top quarks, leaving a more complex signature in the detector. These searches are challenging as strong interference with the Standard Model (SM) tt production is expected [17], leading to a pick-dip shape in the spectrum of the tt invariant mass [18,19]. Good sensitivity is expected if the mediator is heavier than twice the mass of the top quark. Some representative Feynman diagrams for leading-order production of a tt pair by a spin-0 mediator (Y 0 ) and by the SM are presented in Fig. 1.",

The recent search published in a similar Fig. 1 Representative Feynman diagrams for a tt production via spin-0 mediator (Y 0 ) and via the SM context, considering interference with the SM for tt production, was done by the ATLAS collaboration [23] using data of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV and integrated luminosity of 20.3 f b \u22121 . This analysis used a Two-Higgs-Doublet model for the interpretation of the results, with a spin-0 particle mass of 500 \u2212 750 GeV.

The parameters g med\u2212\u03c7\u03c7 and g med\u2212 ff are model dependent couplings. In general, Eq. 1 can be applied to other types of DM candidates, which are not Dirac fermions, but we keep it as a benchmark assumption. Interactions between the dark sector and the SM gauge bosons exist in part of those models, and are taken into account when analysing the results. The calculation of the mediator width from Eqs. 1 and 2 presents an interesting behavior: If the mediator is heavy enough to decay to a pair of top quarks (i.e. ff = tt), the partial decay width of \u03c6/a \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 becomes significantly smaller. This is especially true for high m \u03c7 , where the partial decay width of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 is highly suppressed. Therefore, the tt resonance search along the search for tt + \u03c7\u03c7 are complementary: the former gains better sensitivity for low DM masses, while the latter has a better sensitivity for high DM masses. The Branching Ratio of this kind of spin-0 decay to a pair of top quarks is presented in Fig. 2, assuming couplings only for DM and top quarks, and setting g med\u2212\u03c7\u03c7 = g med\u2212 ff = 1.

The pseudo-scalar (A 0 ) is the only one that couples to a pair of DM candidates, therefore this particle is identified as the mediator between the SM particles and the dark sector. The decoupling limit [40] is assumed. Limits were set recently on this model by ATLAS [11], using final state with the SM Higgs boson (decays to a pair of bottom quarks or photons) and A 0 (decays to a pair of DM candidates). However, the parameter choice was set in order to emphasize the sensitivity of the signatures above. Therefore, we choose different parameters, in order to emphasize the final state discussed in this paper, and to add new constraints on the model. This model has six parameters, which are set as follows: The mass of the light scalar, recognised as the SM Higgs boson in the decoupling limit, is set to m h = 125 GeV; In order to to avoid interference effects between two bosons, we choose the masses of the spin-0 bosons to allow only one of them, A 0 , to decay to a tt pair. Therefore, the mass of the heavier scalar and charged scalar are set equal to each other, m H = m H \u00b1 = 300 GeV, and the mass of the pseudo-scalar is set to m A 0 = 400 GeV; The parameters of the new Z boson, it's mass (m Z ) and coupling (g Z ), has a negligible effect on the tt invariant mass spectrum, and are chosen randomly to be m Z = 3 TeV and g Z = 1. The results are valid for other values of m Z , as long as it is heavy enough to avoid decays of A 0 to Z with another Higgs boson; The ratio between vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan(\u03b2), and the mass of the DM candidate, m \u03c7 , are free parameters. Those two parameters were selected to be scanned, since they have a direct impact on the strength of A 0 interactions and decay width, and therefore on the top pair invariant mass spectrum.",

In both cases interference effects with the SM were considered, and the signal was modeled at Next to Leading Order (NLO) and Next to Next to Leading Order (NNLO) in QCD corrections, respectively. For those limits, however, no interaction with DM candidates was taken into account. This type of interaction is being considered in this section. The results of the former were found to be more efficient for mediator masses which are lower than 500 GeV, while the latter is more efficient for mediator masses which are higher than 500 GeV. This is expected since the corre-sponding ATLAS analysis targeted spin-0 particle masses which are higher than 500 GeV.",

In the case that the mediator decays to a pair of DM candidates, total m \u03c6/a < 40% was used to keep the narrow width approximation valid. Results with higher total widths were discarded.

The exclusion contour is more stringent for the tt resonance searches when m \u03c6/a \u2265 400 GeV, especially when the DM mass is high.

Despite the challenges of this signature from the experimental point of view, it provides unique access to regions in the parameter space with high DM candidates masses, where other signatures quite often do not have the sensitivity. Further expansion of the parameter space covered by this signature is expected, using centre of mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, and with the higher luminosity now recorded by ATLAS and CMS collaborations.",
