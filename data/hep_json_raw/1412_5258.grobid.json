The Y (2175) resonance is observed in the invariant mass spectrum of \u03c6f0(980) with a statistical significance of greater than 10\u03c3. The corresponding mass and width are determined to be M = 2200 \u00b1 6(stat.) \u00b1 5(syst.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 104 \u00b1 15(stat.) \u00b1 15(syst.) MeV, respectively, and the product branching fraction is measured to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7Y (2175), Y (2175) \u2192 \u03c6f0(980), f0(980) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (1.20\u00b10.14(stat.) \u00b10.37(syst.))\u00d7 10 \u22124 . The results are consistent within errors with those of previous experiments. We also measure the branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f1(1285) with f1(1285) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and set upper limits on the branching fractions for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1405)/\u03c6X(1835)/\u03c6X(1870) with \u03b7(1405)/X(1835)/X(1870) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at the 90% confidence level.

            "text": "The Y (2175), also referred to as the \u03c6(2170) by the Particle Data Group (PDG 2014) [1], was first observed by the BABAR experiment [2] in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c6f 0 (980) initial-state-radiation (ISR) process. It was later confirmed by the BESII experiment in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c6f 0 (980) decays [3] and via the same ISR process by the BELLE [4] and BABAR experiments [5] with increased statistics. Since the Y (2175) resonance is produced via ISR in e + e \u2212 collisions, it is known to have J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 . This observation stimulated the speculation that the Y (2175) may be an s-quark counterpart to the Y (4260) [6,7], since both are produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation and exhibit similar decay patterns. Like for the Y (4260), a number of different interpretations have been proposed for the Y (2175) with predicted masses that are consistent, within errors, with the experimental measurements. These include: an ss-gluon hybrid [8]; an excited \u03c6 state [9]; a tetraquark state [10]; a \u039b\u039b bound state [11,12]; or an ordinary \u03c6f 0 (980) resonance produced by interactions between the final state particles [13].",

            "text": "A recent review [14] discusses the basic problem of the large expected decay widths into two mesons, which contradicts experimental observations. Around the mass of the Y (2175), there are two conventional 1 \u2212\u2212 ss states in the quark model, 2 3 D 1 and 3 3 S 1 . According to Ref. [15], the width of the 3 3 S 1 ss state is expected to be about 380 MeV. The total width of the 2 3 D 1 state from both 3 P 0 and flux tube model is expected to be around (150 \u223c 250) MeV [9]. However, the predictions from these strong decay models sometimes deviate from the experimentally found width by a factor of two or three. For comparison, the widths of the 3 3 S 1 and 2 3 D 1 charmonium are less than 110 MeV [16]. Fortunately, the characteristic decay modes of Y(2175) as either a hybrid or ss state are quite different, which may be used to distinguish the hybrid and ss schemes. The possibility of Y (2175) arising from S-wave threshold effects is not excluded. As of now, none of these interpretations have been either established or ruled out by experiment. The confirmation and study of the Y (2175) in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with a large data sample is necessary for clarifying its nature.",

The f 1 (1285) is usually considered to be a member of the axial vector meson nonet, but the interpretation of the \u03b7(1295) is less clear. Both the f 1 (1285) and the \u03b7(1295) were seen in fixed target experiments, but the \u03b7(1295) was not evident in central production, in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions, or in J/\u03c8 decays. Therefore it has been speculated that either the f 1 (1285), at least in some cases, contains an \u03b7(1295) component [17], or that the \u03b7(1295) does not exist. The \u03b7(1405)/\u03b7(1475) pseudoscalar was once regarded as a glueball candidate since it is copiously produced in J/\u03c8 radiative decays [18] and there was only an upper limit from \u03b3\u03b3 collisions [19]. But this viewpoint changed when the \u03b7(1405)/\u03b7(1475) was also observed in untagged \u03b3\u03b3 collisions [20] and in J/\u03c8 hadronic decays.",

For example, the search for them in the \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum recoiling against the \u03c6 in J/\u03c8 decays would be rather interesting for clarifying their nature.",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI (Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with modules of resistive plate muon counters interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% of the full 4\u03c0 solid angle. The momentum resolution for a charged particle at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the ionization energy loss per unit path-length (dE/dx) resolution is 6%.

A structure around 1.28 GeV/c 2 is clearly seen, and the fit results are in good agreement with the world average values of the f 1 (1285) parameters. The product branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 1 (1285) with f 1 (1285) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is measured to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 1 (1285) \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (1.20 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.14)\u00d710 \u22124 .
