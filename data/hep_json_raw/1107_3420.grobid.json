Such large rapidity gap topologies signify a colour singlet or diffractive exchange and HERA has proved to be a rich environment for their study. In particular, the study of diffractive DIS (DDIS), both inclusive and exclusive, has supplied a wealth of experimental data with a hard scale given by the photon virtuality, stimulating the theoretical understanding of diffraction in terms of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD).",

This allows for a description of DDIS in terms of parton densities convoluted with hard scattering matrix elements. The diffractive parton density functions (DPDFs) depend on four kinematic variables, so an additional assumption is often made whereby the proton vertex dynamics factorise from the vertex of the hard scattering, as shown in Fig. 1. While this proton vertex factorisation has no complete foundation in theory, measurements of DDIS from both H1 [4][5][6] and ZEUS [7] show that it holds well enough such that next-toleading order (NLO) QCD fits can be made to the data [4,[8][9][10]. The DPDFs then depend only on the scale Q 2 and the fraction z of the total longitudinal momentum of the diffractive exchange which is carried by the parton entering the hard scattering.",

            "text": "Measurements of the dijet cross section in DDIS allow tests of the DPDFs extracted in fits to inclusive DDIS data. This process, which is known to be dominated by bosongluon fusion, is particularly sensitive to the poorly known gluon DPDF at large z and has thus been used successfully to distinguish between different DPDF sets [10]. DDIS events containing charm particles in the final state have similarly been used to test the gluon DPDF [11,12]. As in the inclusive DIS case, the cross section for DDIS can be expressed in terms of a linear combination of structure functions, F D 2 and F D L [13][14][15]. While F D 2 describes the total photon-proton process, F D L is only sensitive to the longitudinally polarised photon contribution. As for its inclusive counterpart, F D L is thus zero in the quark-parton model, but may acquire a non-zero value, 0 < F D L < F D 2 in QCD, with leading twist contributions dependent on both the diffractive quark and gluon densities [16,17]. A measurement of F D L provides a powerful independent tool to verify our understanding of the underlying dynamics of diffraction up to NLO in QCD and to test the DPDFs. This is particularly important at the lowest z values, where direct information on the gluon density cannot be obtained from dijet data due to kinematic limitations and where novel effects such as parton saturation [18][19][20] or non-DGLAP dynamics [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] are most likely to become important.",

However, due to the relatively poor statistical precision of the measurement, the results were consistent with zero. The H1 Collaboration has recently published measurements of the inclusive structure function F L (x, Q 2 ) [30,31] using the centre-of-mass energy dependence of the DIS cross section at fixed x and Q 2 . A similar approach has been proposed to extract F D L [32]. In addition to measuring F D L itself, it is interesting to compare the relative sizes of the diffractive cross sections induced by transversely and longitudinally polarised virtual photons. This comparison has previously been made for inclusive DIS and exclusive vector meson production through the study of the photoabsorption ratio, R = \u03c3 L /\u03c3 T , where \u03c3 L and \u03c3 T are the cross sections for the scattering of longitudinally and transversely polarised photons, respectively. Whilst R is only weakly dependent on kinematic variables in the DIS regime for inclusive cross sections [30,33], a strong dependence on Q 2 is observed for vector meson production [34], the longitudinally polarised photon cross section becoming much larger than its transverse counterpart at large Q 2 . Since DDIS incorporates vector meson production and related processes at large z, but exhibits kinematic dependencies which are similar to those of inclusive DIS at low z, it is not easy to predict its photoabsorption ratio. By analogy with the inclusive DIS case, we define",

Proton vertex factorisation is assumed in both cases and the diffractive quark densities are very similar in the two fits. However, the two DPDF fits differ in their parameterisations of the gluon density, which leads to considerable differences at large fractional momenta z [4], where the constraints from inclusive DDIS data are poor. Corresponding differences are visible between the Fit A and Fit B predictions for F D L .

            "text": "A complementary approach to modelling diffractive DIS is offered by dipole models [36][37][38]. Viewed in the proton rest frame, the incoming virtual photon fluctuates into a qq pair or higher multiplicity state, whose scattering strength from the target is governed by a universal dipole cross section. Dipole models which are applicable to DDIS generally contain three contributions [36,37,39]: leading twist terms corresponding to the scattering of qq and qqg dipoles derived from fluctuations of transversely polarised photons, and a higher twist contribution (suppressed like 1/Q 2 ) in which qq dipoles are obtained from longitudinally polarised photons. Dipole models thus tend to neglect the leading twist contribution to F D L which emerges naturally from NLO DPDF fits. However, the higher twist contribution to F D L is of particular interest, since it can be predicted in perturbative QCD [40], by coupling a qq dipole to a two-gluon exchange in a similar phenomenology to that successfully applied to vector meson cross sections at HERA [41,42]. In many dipole-inspired models, this higher twist component is the dominant feature of \u03c3 D r at large \u03b2 and low-to-moderate Q 2 . In a recent hybrid approach to fitting \u03c3 D r [43] (labelled 'Golec-Biernat & \u0141uszczak' here), the leading and higher twist contributions to F D L are included simultaneously. A parametrisation similar to that in [4] is used for the diffractive quark and gluon DPDFs, but the higher twist longitudinal photon contribution is also included via the parametrisation employed in [36,37]. The quality of the fit to the \u03c3 D r data is similar with and without the higher twist term. However, its inclusion leads to a sizeable effect on the diffractive gluon density at large fractional momenta and the higher twist contribution dominates the resulting predictions for F D L for \u03b2 0.6 at the lowest Q 2 values considered here.",

For y > 0.6 (0.56) in the 460 (575) GeV data, the SpaCal trigger decision is combined with information from the BST or CIP in order to reduce the rate. For lower y values, corresponding to high energy depositions in the SpaCal, triggers based on SpaCal-only information are used for all three datasets. The combined efficiency of the LME high y triggers is around 99% for positron energies above 3 GeV, as monitored with independent triggers. The data are corrected for this inefficiency, which has a small dependence on the radial position of the scattered positron in the SpaCal, R spacal , due to the track requirement. The combination of SpaCal-only triggers used has a negligibly small inefficiency. The event selection is based on the identification of the scattered positron as a localised energy deposition, a cluster, of more than 3.4(12.0) GeV in the SpaCal in the LME (920 GeV) data. Backgrounds due predominantly to photoproduction processes, where the scattered positron is lost down the beam-pipe, are reduced by requiring that the logarithmic energy-weighted cluster radius, r log , is smaller than 5 cm and that the energy measured in the hadronic section of the SpaCal associated with the cluster is less than 15% of the cluster energy. If the highest energy cluster fails to fulfil these selection criteria, the second and third highest energy clusters are considered in turn.

This is important at high y in order to describe the data. At low Q 2 , H1 2006 DPDF Fit B undershoots the data, as observed previously [4].

Resonant contributions to the diffractive cross section, important at low Q 2 and low M X < 5 GeV, are modelled using the DIFFVM [58] generator. The DIFFVM generator is also used to simulate proton dissociative events with M Y < 5 GeV to correct the measurements to the M Y and t ranges given in (5) under the assumption of proton vertex factorisation.

For each correlated systematic error source, each of the cross section points is adjusted according to the positive and negative shifts 2 and the fit is repeated using \u03b4 stat+inc for the errors on the cross section points.

All of these correlated errors are added in quadrature with \u03b4 stat+inc to give the total error on F D L . The normalisation uncertainty on the value of F D L is set by the normalisation uncertainty on the cross section measurements and is therefore 8.1%. 2 In fits which include the published 820 GeV data, a more conservative approach is used whereby the 820 GeV data remain fixed.

The inner error bars represent the statistical uncertainties on the measurement, the outer error bars represent the statistical and total systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The normalisation uncertainty is not shown. Up to four beam energies are shown, where the lowest y 2 /Y + point is given by the 820 GeV data for Q 2 = 4 GeV 2 and by the 920 GeV data at higher Q 2 . The linear fits to the data are also shown as a solid line, the slope of which gives the value of F D L . The predictions and extrapolated predictions of H1 2006 DPDF Fit B are shown as dashed and dotted lines, respectively and five F D L points are greater than zero by more than 3\u03c3 . The data are compared with the predictions of the H1 DPDF Fits A and B [4] and with the Golec-Biernat & \u0141uszczak model [43] (Sect. 3). All three models are consistent with the data, although there is a tendency for the measurements to lie above the predictions. Although the prediction of [43] lies significantly above both Fit A and Fit B at large \u03b2, the experimental precision is insufficient to distinguish between the models. The measured values of F D 2 are also shown in Fig. 7. The F D 2 measurements agree well with the predic- 2 and F D L at the 95% confidence level in the highest \u03b2 bins.

The data are compatible with the prediction based on H1 2006 DPDF Fit B, though they are also consistent with other models. The data at Q 2 = 11.5 GeV 2 indicate that the longitudinally and transversely polarised photon cross sections are of the same order of magnitude (R D \u223c 1 and F D 2 \u223c 2F D L ). At Q 2 = 44 GeV 2 , where larger \u03b2 values are accessed, there is a tendency for the data to lie above the prediction, which tends to zero as \u03b2 \u2192 1. There is no evidence for the steep rise in R D which might be expected at large \u03b2 if configurations similar to vector meson electroproduction were dominant in this region. 3 The values of R D and their errors are given in Table 6. The relative importance in inclusive and diffractive scattering of the longitudinally polarised photon cross section compared with its transverse counterpart is investigated via the ratio R D /R, shown as a function of x in Fig. 10. Only data with Q 2 > 7 GeV 2 , where a measurement of R is pos-sible in this analysis, are used. Data with |R D /R| > 20 and a relative uncertainty greater than 100% are not shown. The ratio data suggest that the longitudinally polarised photon contribution plays a larger role in the diffractive than the inclusive case. Averaged over all data, R D /R = 2.8 \u00b1 1.1. The data are well reproduced by the ratio of predictions from H1 2006 DPDF Fit B and an H1 fit to inclusive DIS data, H1 PDF 2009 [63]. At high Q 2 , corresponding to high x and therefore \u03b2, the prediction decreases towards zero as x \u2192 1.

The reduced cross section is measured in the range of photon virtualities 4.0 \u2264 Q 2 \u2264 44.0 GeV 2 and of the longitudinal momentum fraction of the diffractive exchange 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u2264 x P \u2264 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The reduced cross section measurements agree well with predictions derived from leading twist NLO QCD fits to previous H1 data in the region of validity of the fit. The data at high and medium inelasticity y are used to extract the first measurement of the longitudinal diffractive structure function F D L . There is a tendency for the predictions to lie below the F D L data, but the data are compatible with H1 2006 DPDF Fit A and Fit B as well as with a model which includes a higher twist contribution at high \u03b2, based on a colour dipole approach. The procedure also allows a simultaneous extraction of F D 2 , independently of assumptions made on F D L , in the same kinematic range. The F D 2 measurements agree well with the predictions of H1 DPDF Fit B for Q 2 \u2265 11.5 GeV 2 . Within the uncertainties, all measurements are consistent with the expectation that 0 < F D L < F D 2 . The ratio R D of diffractive cross sections for longitudinally to transversely polarised photons is measured in the same kinematic range as F D L . At fixed Q 2 and x P , this ratio is relatively flat as a function of \u03b2 and suggests that the cross sections for the two polarisation states of the photon are of comparable size. The ratio of R D to its inclusive scattering counterpart, R, is extracted in the region Q 2 \u2265 11.5 GeV 2 . The R D /R data indicate that the longitudinally polarised photon cross section plays a larger role in the diffractive than in the inclusive case. The R D and R D /R measurements are well reproduced by the predictions based on H1 2006 DPDF Fit B and the H1 PDF 2009 inclusive PDF set.",
