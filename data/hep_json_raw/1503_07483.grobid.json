The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to 3.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected with the LHCb detector. The significance of the signal is 6.4 standard deviations. The branching fraction is measured to be \u00bd3.31 AE 0.64\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.28\u00f0syst\u00de AE 0.12\u00f0norm\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22125 , where the third uncertainty comes from the B AE \u2192 \u03b7 0 K AE branching fraction that is used as a normalization. In addition, the charge asymmetries of B AE \u2192 \u03b7 0 K AE and B AE \u2192 \u03d5K AE , which are control channels, are measured to be \u00f0\u22120.2 AE 1.3\u00de% and \u00f0\u00fe1.7 AE 1.3\u00de%, respectively. All results are consistent with theoretical expectations.",

            "text": "Hadronic decays of beauty hadrons into final states without charm quarks (charmless decays) are suppressed in the standard model of elementary particles. They proceed predominantly through b \u2192 u transitions, mediated by the emission of a virtual W AE boson, and b \u2192 s transitions, mediated by the exchange of a virtual W AE boson and a virtual quark. The respective \"tree\" and \"penguin\" amplitudes are of similar size, allowing for possible large quantum interference effects measurable as charge-parity (CP) violating asymmetries. New particles not described in the standard model may contribute with additional amplitudes, and therefore affect both the decay rates and the CP asymmetries [1]. The B AE \u2192 \u03b7 0 K AE and B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 0 K 0 decays, first observed by the CLEO Collaboration [2], have some of the largest branching fractions among all charmless hadronic B-meson decays [3]. (Charge conjugation of neutral B 0 \u00f0s\u00de mesons is implied throughout this Letter. The notations \u03b7 0 and \u03d5 refer to the \u03b7 0 \u00f0958\u00de and \u03d5\u00f01020\u00de mesons, respectively.) Studies of such decays, conducted so far mostly at e \u00fe e \u2212 colliders operating at the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance, provide accurate measurements of integrated [4,5] and time-dependent [6,7] CP-violating asymmetries in charmless hadronic B AE and B 0 meson decays, and are useful to look for deviations from standard model predictions.",

Decays to this final state of B 0 s andB 0 s mesons flavor tagged at production may therefore be used to investigate time-dependent CP asymmetries in a complementary way to the measurements in B 0 s \u2192 \u03d5\u03d5 [16], but without the need for an angular analysis.",

The latter result supersedes the previous LHCb measurement [26]. The measured B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 0 \u03b7 0 branching fraction, B\u00f0B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 0 \u03b7 0 \u00de \u00bc \u00bd3.31 AE 0.64\u00f0stat\u00deAE 0.28\u00f0syst\u00de AE 0.12\u00f0norm\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22125 , agrees with the theoretical predictions. This newly observed B 0 s decay channel to a charmless CP eigenstate opens possibilities for further  constraining the standard model with time-dependent CP asymmetry measurements.",
