In this paper we summarize the results from pion-carbon collisions recorded at beam momenta of 158 and 350 GeV/c. Hadron production measurements in these types of interactions is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the muon production in extensive air showers. In particular, production of (anti)baryons and \u03c1 0 are mechanisms responsible for increasing the number of muons which reach the ground. The underestimation of the (anti)baryons or \u03c1 0 production rates in current hadronic interaction models could be one of the sources of the excess of muons observed by cosmic ray experiments. The results on the production spectra of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p,p, \u039b,\u039b, K 0 S , \u03c1 0 , \u03c9 and K * 0 are presented, as well as their comparison to predictions of hadronic interaction models currently used in air shower simulations.",

            "text": "Measurements of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are only possible through the detection of secondary particles produced in extensive air showers (EAS). The inference of some of the properties of the primary cosmic ray particles like their nuclear mass, relies on the comparison of measured EAS observables to predictions from simulations [1]. These simulations are performed by Monte Carlo codes that make use of hadronic interaction models to describe the nucleus-air and hadron-air collisions along the shower development [2]. Although simulations using recent hadronic models can provide a good overall description of EAS, it has been observed by cosmic ray experiments that the hadronic models fail on describing the muon production in EAS. Measurements by HiRes-MIA [3], Pierre Auger Observatory [4][5][6][7], Telescope Array [8], KASCADE-Grande [9], IceTop/IceCube [10] and Sugar [11] show that there is an inconsistency between data and simulations for observables related to the muonic component of air showers. In particular, the number of muons (N \u00b5 ) obtained from simulations is observed to be significantly smaller than the measured ones, which is known as the \"muon deficit problem\".",

            "text": "The majority of muons in EAS are produced by the decay of charged mesons, which in turn, are produced in meson-air and nucleon-air interactions. Depending on the primary energy and detection distance, the relevant mesonair and nucleon-air interaction energies are between 10 and 1000 GeV [12,13]. Therefore, measurements of particle production in this energy range are of great value for understanding muon production in EAS and consequently for improving its modeling. Of particular interest are the pro-duction spectra of (anti-)baryons and \u03c1 0 in meson-air and nucleon-air. It is well known [14,15] that the production of (anti-)baryons and \u03c1 0 mesons in hadronic interactions is important to predict the muon content of air showers. Therefore the production cross sections of these particles needs to be known accurately for a precise modeling of air showers NA61/SHINE experiment [16] (see Sec. 2) has provided a number of particle production and cross section measurements which are relevant for the modeling of hadronic interaction in EAS (e.g. Refs [17,18]). In this paper, however, the focus will be on the results of the 2009 run with a negatively charged pion beam colliding against a thin carbon target (\u03c0 \u2212 +C data) at 158 and 350 GeV/c. Since \u03c0-air is the most abundant hadronic interaction occurring in an EAS, our \u03c0 \u2212 +C data is of high relevance for the tuning of hadronic interaction models dedicated to EAS simulations. The results are presented in three parts: the spectra of charged hadrons (\u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p andp) are presented in Sec. 3, the spectra of V 0 mesons (\u039b,\u039b and K 0 S ) in Sec. 4 and the spectra of resonance mesons (\u03c1 0 , K * 0 and \u03c9) in Sec. 5.",

From thep spectra shown in Figs. 5 and 6, one can see that the (anti)baryon production is not underestimated in general by the models. In particular, the Epos model shows to describe very well thep production. As a conclusion, the underproduction of (anti)baryons in \u03c0air interactions by the hadronic models is unlikely to be the most relevant source of the lack of muons in simulations.",

Although these measurements are surely relevant for model testing and tuning, our main motivation here is to reduce the systematic uncertainties on the \u03c0 \u00b1 and p(p) spectra due to the feed-down contributions from weak decays. Since a significant fraction of \u03c0 \u00b1 and p(p) detected are produced by the decay of \u039b,\u039b and K 0 S , this effect has to be corrected. In the results shown in Sec. 3 (and in Ref. [20]) this correction is done by using Monte Carlo simulations and the model dependence of this procedure is added to the systematic uncertainties. By measuring the spectra of \u039b,\u039b and K 0 S , we are able to avoid this model dependence and consequently reduce the systematic uncertainties. Updated \u03c0 \u00b1 and p(p) spectra with improved systematic uncertainties will be presented in the future in another publication.",
