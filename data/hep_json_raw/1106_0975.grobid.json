In the past century successive generations of detectors realized new ways to visualize particle interactions driving the advance of the physical knowledge and the discovery of unpredicted phenomena, even on the basis of single fully reconstructed events. In particular, bubble chamber detectors were an incredibly fruitful tool permitting to visualize and measure particle interactions, providing fundamental contributions to particle physics discoveries. Gigantic bubble chambers like Gargamelle [1] (3 ton of mass) were extraordinary achievements, successfully employed in particular in neutrino physics. The major limitations of bubble chambers in the search for rare phenomena are the impossibility to scale their size towards much larger masses and their duty cycle intrinsically limited by the mechanics of the expansion system.",

The read-out chain is organized on a 32-channel modularity. A Decoupling Board receives the signals from the chamber and passes them to an Analogue Board via decoupling capacitors; it also provides wire biasing voltage and the distribution of the test signals. The Analogue Board hosts the front-end amplifiers and performs 16:1 channel multiplexing and 10-bit ADC digitization at 400 ns sampling time per channel. The overall gain is about 1000 electrons per ADC count, setting the signal of minimum ionizing particles to ~ 15 ADC counts with a dynamic range of about 100 minimum ionizing particles. A 3 \u00b5s decay constant is used for the unipolar signals coming Collection and Induction 1 wires, while 100 \u00b5s decay constant is used for the bipolar current signals (Induction 2 wires). A Digital Board hosts as a 10 bit wide, waveform recorder. It continuously reads the data, stores them in multi-event circular buffers, each covering a full drift distance. When a trigger signal occurs, the active buffer is frozen, writing operations are moved to the next free buffer, and the stored data are read out by the DAQ. This configuration guarantees no dead time, until the maximum DAQ throughput (1 full-drift event per second) is reached. The average electronic noise achieved with the special designed low noise front-end is well within expectations: 1500 electrons r.m.s. to be compared with ~ 15000 free electrons produced by a minimum ionizing particle in 3 mm (S/N ~ 10).",

A fundamental requirement for the performance of a LAr-TPC is that electrons produced by ionizing particles can travel \"unperturbed\" from the point of production to the wire planes. In other words, electronegative impurities (mainly O 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 ) in LAr must be kept at a very low concentration level (less than 0.1 ppb). To this aim, each half-module is equipped with two gas argon and one liquid argon recirculation/purification systems. Argon gas is continuously drawn from the cryostat ceiling and, re-condensed, drops into Oxysorb \u2122 filters to finally get back into the LAr containers. LAr instead is recirculated by mean of an immersed, cryogenic pump (~ 2 m 3 /h, full volume recirculation in 6 days) and is purified through standard Hydrosorb/Oxysorb\u2122 filters before being re-injected into the cryostats.",

The trigger system relies on both, the scintillation light signals provided by the internal PMTs and by the CNGS proton extraction time. As a starting layout, for each of the four chambers, the analog sum of signal from PMTs is exploited with a discrimination threshold set at around 100 photo-electrons, guaranteeing an almost full efficiency for the interactions induced by CNGS neutrinos. The trigger for the CNGS neutrino interactions is based on the presence of the PMT signal within a CNGS related gate. For every CNGS SPS cycle two proton spills, lasting 10.5 \u00b5s each, separated by 50 ms, are extracted from the SPS machine. An \"early warning\" signal is sent from CERN to LNGS 80 ms before the first proton spill extraction, allowing the opening of two ~ 60 \u00b5s gates in correspondence to the predicted extraction times. The most accurate timing inside the controller is realized by a 40 MHz counter, reset every millisecond by a synchronization signal containing absolute time information, generated by the master clock unit of the LNGS external Laboratories (GPS unit and 10 MHz atomic clock) synchronized to CERN SPS accelerator clock. A trigger rate of about 1 mHz is obtained including neutrino interactions inside the detector and muons from neutrino interactions in the upstream rocks. The analysis of the recorded neutrino interactions in LAr, shows a synchronization between ICARUS and the actual proton extraction time as written in the CNGS-database, sufficient to reconstruct the 10.5 \u00b5s width of the two proton spills (figure 3). The residual 2.4 ms delay is in agreement with the neutrino time of flight (2.44 ms) taking into account the timing signal propagation delay to Hall B (~ 44 \u00b5s). The trigger for cosmic rays exploits the coincidence of the PMT's sum signals of the two adjacent chambers in the same half-module, relying on the 50% transparency of the cathode mechanical structure. This allows for an efficient reduction of the spurious signals maximizing the detection of low energy events. A trigger rate of 25 mHz has been achieved well below the maximum allowed DAQ rate, resulting in about 83 cosmic events per hour collected in the full T600.",

Purity is continuously monitored measuring the charge attenuation along ionizing cosmic muon tracks crossing the full drift path without evident associated \u03b4-rays and \u03b3's. About 50 muon tracks are sufficient to measure day-by-day the electron charge attenuation within 3% precision dominated by residual Landau charge fluctuations. With the liquid recirculation turned on, the LAr purity steadily increased, reaching values of free electron lifetime 1 (\u03c4 ele ) exceeding 6 ms in both half-modules after few months of operation (figure 4). In the East half-module this value was reached after tuning of the recirculation circuit. This corresponds to a maximum free electron yield attenuation of 16%, at the maximum drift distance of 1.5 m (corresponding to 1 ms maximum drift time). Pump maintenance required some stops of the LAr recirculation lasting several days, resulting in a sudden degradation of the purity, however the \u03c4 ele went never below 1 ms. The different asymptotic levels of LAr purity, reached after each restarting of the recirculation system, are probably due to different equilibrium values of the effective recirculation speed. The evolution of the residual impurity concentration can be described with a simple model as dN(t)/dt = -N/\u03c4 R + k L + k D exp(-t/\u03c4 D ) where \u03c4 R is the time needed to recirculate a full detector volume, k L is the total impurity leak rate and degassing rate and k D is the internal residual degassing rate assumed to vanish with a time constant \u03c4 D . Uniform distribution of the impurities throughout the detector volume is also assumed, as experimentally supported by the lifetime measurement with muon tracks in different regions of the TPC's.",

The deposited energy associated to the single visible tracks corrected for quenching [14] and electron attenuation along the drift are collected in table 1 together with their directions in space. The use of two different views allows for recognizing the presence of two distinct electromagnetic showers pointing to the primary vertex. The corresponding conversion distances are measured to be 23 mm and 69 mm respectively. Even if the two photons overlap in the Collection view, used for the calorimetric energy measurement, the associated invariant mass m 12 * = 125\u00b115 MeV/c 2 , compatible with the \u03c0 0 mass, is determined, under the assumption of equally shared energy between the two photons, from their opening angle \u03b8 12 = (27.7\u00b12.5)\u00b0 and the total energy E tot = 521\u00b116 MeV. The closer photon initial ionization -averaging over the first 6 hits -amounts to 2.2 m.i.p. (minimum ionizing particle): this is a clear signature of a pair conversion confirming the expected e/\u03b3 identification capabilities of the detector.  The leading muon deposits by ionization a total energy of about 2.7 GeV before exiting the detector. Due to multiple scattering, the muon track deviates up to 66 mm from a straight line through its first and the last points. Thanks to the 200 \u00b5m resolution measured along the drift coordinate on each wire, exploiting multiple scattering the momentum of the long muon track has been measured to be p \u00b5 = 10.5\u00b11.1 GeV/c.",

Its kinetic energy is assumed to be equal to the total energy deposited by track 3 and its daughters. Track 5 is identified as a kaon, decaying in flight into a muon. The kaon momentum at the decay point has been calculated from the muon energy and the decay angle. Adding the measured energy deposition before decay, the initial kaon momentum can be evaluated as 672\u00b144 MeV/c. The capability to identify and reconstruct low energy kaons is a major advantage of the LAr-TPC technique for proton decay searches. In this event, the kaon momentum is not far from the average one (300 MeV/c) for instance, in the p \u2192 \u03bd K + channel. Also the ability to identify \u03c0 0 , as in this event, is important for many nucleon decay channels, as well as for the discrimination of neutral current events when looking for \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations.  The total hadronic energy in the event, E h = 2.3\u00b10.5 GeV, is certainly underestimated, since one particle (marked as 8 in figure 5-A) from the secondary vertex escapes from the bottom face of the detector, and neutrons may have been produced and escaped detection. The missing transverse momentum reconstructed for the event is 250 MeV/c; it is represented in figure 6 together with the 3D reconstruction of the event. Despite the non-full containment of the event, the missing transverse momentum value is fully consistent with the theoretical expectation from the Fermi motion of target nucleons, and compatible with the measurements at the WANF neutrino beam with the 50-liter LAr-TPC prototype [15]. The reconstructed total energy is 12.6\u00b11.2 GeV, within the energy range of the CNGS beam [16].",

It has been successfully installed in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory and it is presently collecting data after having smoothly reached the optimal working conditions. LAr is a cheap liquid vastly produced by industry, which potentially permits to realize large mass detectors. ICARUS T600 represents the final milestone of a series of fundamental technological achievements in the last several years; its underground operation demonstrates that the ICARUS technology is now mature and scalable to much larger masses, in the range of tens of kton [17] as required to realize the next generation experiments for neutrino physics and proton decay searches. Finally, the examples of neutrino interaction event analyzed in this paper demonstrate that also the reconstruction procedure is well under control fully exploiting the physical potentiality of this technology.",

The approval and encouragement of the Scientific Committee INFN, in the persons of its presidents Furio Bobisut, Carlo Bemporad, Francesco Ronga and Roberto Battiston have been essential. The LNGS with its directors Alessandro Bettini, Eugenio Coccia and Lucia Votano, along with all the technical staff of the Laboratories, gave a fundamental contribution. The Russian group warmly acknowledges the support of the INR director Victor Matveev and his involvement in the experiment. During this period many valuable colleagues have made different choices and have left the experiment deciding to follow different routes after having left relevant scientific and technical contributions. We want to remind the researchers of IHEP of Beijing, led by Ma-Ji Mao, those of ETH, led by Andrea Rubbia and many others like the colleagues of Granada University led by Antonio Bueno. In particular we want to honor the merit of all the technical staff of INFN who validly contributed to the T600 realization with their highly professional skill. We cannot even forget the contribution and joint effort of many industrial realities that played a major role in the realization of the detector: Air Liquid and Stirling for cryogenics, Breme Tecnica, Galli-Morelli and CINEL for the inner detector, and CAEN for the data acquisition electronics. The Polish groups acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland for four SPB grants, the INFN FAI program and the EU Commission. Finally we thank CERN, in particular the CNGS staff, for the successful operation of the neutrino beam facility, which represents an important part of the ICARUS physics programme.",
