Contributions from B 0 decays to the non-resonant DK + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, which can pollute the DK * 0 reconstructed signal candidates due to the large natural width of the K * 0 , can be treated in a model-independent way, as shown in ref.

The LHCb detector [9] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution \u2206p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and an impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger [10] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction. This analysis uses events selected by the hardware level trigger either when one of the charged particles of the signal decay gives a large enough energy deposit in the calorimeter system (hadron trigger), or when one of the particles in the event, not coming from the signal decay, fulfills the trigger requirements (i.e. mainly events triggered by one particle coming from the decay of the other B in the event). The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a high scalar sum of the p T of the tracks and a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one track should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and an impact parameter (IP) \u03c7 2 with respect to the PV greater than 16. The IP \u03c7 2 is defined as the difference between the \u03c7 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered track. A multivariate algorithm is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

Potential contributions to the decay amplitudes from the non-resonant B 0 \u2192 DK + \u03c0 \u2212 mode are reduced by requiring that the K * 0 reconstructed mass is within \u00b150 MeV/c 2 of the nominal mass and the absolute value of the cosine of the K * 0 helicity angle is greater than 0.4. The results for the CP -violating observables are These are the first measurements of CP asymmetries in B 0 and B 0 s to DK * 0 decays with the neutral D meson decaying into a CP -even final state. Triggering, reconstructing and selecting a pure sample of these fully hadronic B decays is challenging in a high rate and high track-multiplicity environment, especially in the forward direction of LHCb. The present statistical limitations are due to a combination of several factors, the most important one being the trigger. In order to keep the output rate below its maximum of 1 MHz, the current hardware trigger imposes relatively restrictive criteria on the minimum transverse momentum of hadrons, which affect the efficiency for fully-hadronic modes. This limitation is overcome in the proposed LHCb upgrade [21,22] by reading out the detector at the maximum LHC bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz. With more data, improved measurements of these and other quantities in B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 decays will result in important constraints on the angle \u03b3 of the Unitarity Triangle.",
