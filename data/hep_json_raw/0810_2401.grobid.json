These flavour changing neutral current decays are forbidden at tree level in the SM and hence strongly suppressed. In many NP scenarios these decays appear at the one-loop level, i.e., at the same order as the SM processes. Hence, the contributions of NP to branching ratios and asymmetries can be as large as the SM contributions, making these decays a good hunting ground for New Physics. Leptonic B-meson decays, in which all final state particles are either charged leptons or neutrinos, are also often sensitive to the presence of New Physics. As with the radiative penguin decays, virtual heavy particles predicted by NP can contribute to leptonic decays.",
