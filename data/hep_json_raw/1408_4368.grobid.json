Charge-parity (CP) violation and rare decay processes involving weak decays of B mesons provide tests of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism [1,2] in the Standard Model (SM). The CKM matrix describes all flavour changing transitions of quarks in the SM. These include tree-level decays, which are expected to be largely unaffected by non-SM contributions, and flavour changing neutral current transitions characterized by the presence of loops in the relevant diagrams, which are sensitive to the presence of non-SM physics. Tests of the CKM matrix structure, commonly represented by the unitarity triangle (UT), are of fundamental importance.",

By contrast, for \u22122\u03b2 s , the dependence of the sensitivity on \u03ba is very weak. In Fig. 4 we show the PDFs for \u03b3 obtained from analysis C and for \u22122\u03b2 s obtained from analysis D, corresponding to \u03ba = 0.5. The numerical results from both analyses are reported in Table 7. The 68% probability interval for \u03b3 is It is worth emphasizing that, although this study is similar to that presented in Ref. [13], there are two relevant differences, in addition to the use of updated experimental inputs. First, the upper limits of the priors on d and q are chosen to be much larger, to include all nonzero likelihood regions and to remove any sizable dependence of the results on the choice of the priors. In particular, this leads to a bigger impact of U-spin breaking effects at very large \u03ba values. Second, the adopted parameterization of non-factorizable U-spin breaking is slightly different, in order to propagate equally the effects of the breaking on every topology contributing to the total decay amplitudes.",
