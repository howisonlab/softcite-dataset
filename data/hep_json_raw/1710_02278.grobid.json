No significant signals are observed and the corresponding upper limits on the branching fractions at the 90% confidence level are determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D 0 e + e \u2212 + c.c.) < 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 D 0 e + e \u2212 + c.c.) < 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , respectively. Our limit on B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D 0 e + e \u2212 + c.c.) is more stringent by two orders of magnitude than the previous results, and B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 D 0 e + e \u2212 + c.c.) is measured for the first time.",

Such decays can also occur via long-distance effects on the hadron level, which are, according to Ref. [2], expected to have the same order of magnitude as the FCNC process. The decay branching fraction for this kind of rare process is expected to be of order 10 \u221210 to 10 \u221213 in the SM [3,4]. However, many new physics models, such as the Topcolor models [5], the minimal supersymmetric standard model with R-parity violation [6], and the two Higgs doublet model [7], predict that the decay branching fractions can be enhanced by two or three orders of magnitude. Searching for experimental evidence for these FCNC processes offers an ideal opportunity to study non-perturbative QCD effects and their underlying dynamics, and serves as a probe to search for new physics beyond the SM [8,9].",

The cylindrical BESIII detector has an effective geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 and is divided into a barrel section and two endcaps. It contains a small-cell, helium-based (40% He, 60% C 3 H 8 ) main drift chamber (MDC) which provides momentum measurements for charged particles with a resolution of 0.5% at a momentum of 1 GeV/c in a magnetic field of 1 Tesla. The energy loss measurement (dE/dx) provided by the MDC has a resolution better than 6%.

For decay mode II, a 5C kinematic fit is performed under the hypothesis of \u03c8 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3\u03b3e + e \u2212 with an additional constraint on the mass of the \u03b3\u03b3 pair to the \u03c0 0 nominal mass (5C), and \u03c7 2 5C < 70 is required.

This effect occurs primarily at the beam pipe, which has an inner diameter of 63 mm, or the inner MDC wall, which has a diameter of 108 mm. To suppress these backgrounds, a \u03b3 conversion finder algorithm [24] was developed to reconstruct the \u03b3 conversion vertex using a set of parameters. These include the distance R xy from the IP to the reconstructed vertex point of the e + e \u2212 pair in the x -y plane, the distance \u2206 xy between the two intersection points of the two circles describing the trajectories of the electron and positron in the x -y plane and the line connecting their centers, the invariant mass M (e + e \u2212 ) of the e + e \u2212 pair, the angle \u03b8 eg between the photon momentum vector (in the e + e \u2212 system) and the direction from the IP (run averaged) to the reconstructed vertex in the x -y plane, and the angle \u03b8 e + e \u2212 between the momenta of e + and e \u2212 in the x -y plane. The \u03b3 conversion vertex is identified with the criteria R xy > 2 cm and \u2206 xy < 6\u03c3 \u2206xy as well as cos \u03b8 eg > 0.99, and the events satisfying these criteria are removed. This selection removes 95.0% of all \u03b3 conversion events while losing less than 5.0% efficiency for the signal decays. The criteria are determined by studying a control sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the \u03b3 conversion into an e + e \u2212 pair.
