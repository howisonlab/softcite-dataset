Secondly, understanding the details of the prompt onia production is a challenging task and a good testbed for various QCD calculations, spanning both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Last, but not the least, heavy quarkonia are among the decay products of heavier states, serving as good signatures in searches for rare decays and CP-violating processes which form the backbone of the long-term AT-LAS B-Physics programme. These processes have prompt quarkonia as a background and, as such, a good description of the underlying quarkonium production process is crucial to the success of these studies.",

In the case of a di-muon trigger, both muons from the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 decays are forced to have relatively large transverse momenta.

Now one has a high p T muon which triggered the event and one reconstructed track down to a p T threshold around 0.5 GeV. Thus, the onium events with a single muon trigger typically have high values of | cos \u03b8 * |, complementing the di-muon sample (see Figure 2, which shows the acceptance for both triggers). Combined carefully together the single and di-muon samples provide excellent coverage across almost the entire range of cos \u03b8 * over the same onia p T range. The measured distributions from the combined data sample are corrected for acceptance and efficiencies to recover the true underlying distribution. Three MC datasets were produced, with fully transverse/ longitudinal polarisation and one with zero polarisation, to test the ability of ATLAS in these limit cases. The resultant distributions for the \u03b1 gen = \u00b11 datasets are shown in Figure 3 and are detailed for all three in Table 1, along with the corrected cross-section in that p T bin. The errors shown include statistical errors on the data, as well as the systematic effects of uncertainties on the acceptances and efficiencies.   Figure 3.
