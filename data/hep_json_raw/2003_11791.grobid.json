The data were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration using a 160 GeV muon beam impinging on an isoscalar 6 LiD target. The regime of deep-inelastic scattering is ensured by requiring Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 for the photon virtuality and W > 5 GeV/c 2 for the invariant mass of the produced hadronic system. Bjorken-x is restricted to the range 0.01 to 0.40. Protons and antiprotons are identified in the momentum range from 20 GeV/c to 60",

In the whole studied z-region, the p over p multiplicity ratio is found to be below the lower limit expected from calculations based on leading-order perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). Kaons were previously analysed in the momentum range 12 GeV/c to 40 GeV/c. In the present analysis this range is extended up to 55 GeV/c, whereby events with larger virtual-photon energies are included in the analysis and the observed K \u2212 over K + ratio becomes closer to the expectation of next-to-leading order pQCD. The results of both analyses strengthen our earlier conclusion that at COMPASS energies the phase space available for single-hadron production in deep-inelastic scattering should be taken into account in the standard pQCD formalism.",

These functions presently cannot be predicted by theory, but their scale evolution is described by the DGLAP equations [1]. For a given negative four-momentum transfer squared Q 2 , in leading order (LO) pQCD the FF D h q (z, Q 2 ) represents the probability density that a hadron h is produced in the fragmentation of a quark with flavour q. The produced hadron carries a fraction z of the virtual-photon energy \u03bd, where the latter is defined in the laboratory frame.",

However, only information about D h q + D h q is accessible there and only limited flavour separation is possible. Additional input, like semiinclusive measurements of deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (SIDIS), is required to fully understand quark fragmentation into hadrons. In the case of the SIDIS cross section, FFs are convoluted with parton distribution functions (PDFs). As these are rather well known, FFs for q and q can be accessed separately and full flavour separation is possible in principle. As a result, FFs obtained using only e + e \u2212 data differ in some cases significantly from those that were determined by additionally taking into account data from SIDIS or other processes, see Refs. [2][3][4][5][6][7]. able by improving the kaon identification procedure. Note that when measuring a multiplicity ratio, several systematic uncertainties cancel in both theory and experiment. Thus a multiplicity ratio can be considered as one of the most robust observables presently available when analysing SIDIS data and the analysis given in this Letter hence presents a test of the applicability of pQCD in the studied kinematic domain.",

[17], the expected lower limits on R p in these two x-bins are 0.51 and 0.28. These values are about 10% higher if newer PDF sets as in Refs. [18,19] are used instead. Due to the above mentioned lack of reliable proton FFs at NLO, presently no predictions can be made for the lower limit of R p at higher perturbative order. We also evaluate R p with the LEPTO Monte Carlo event generator [20] (version 6.5), with the result that the LUND string fragmentation model [21] used in LEPTO is incapable to model R p correctly. For example, for z = 0.5 LEPTO predicts R p \u2248 1, which is definitely not supported by the data as it will be shown below. On the other hand, for z > 0.85 the predicted value of R p falls below the LO pQCD lower limit. This is possible as in the LUND model the mechanism of string hadronisation does not only depend on quark and hadron types and on z, as in pQCD, but also on the type of the target nucleon and on x, see Ref. [22] for more details.",

Its radiator volume was filled with C 4 F 10 leading to a threshold for pion, kaon and proton identification of about 3 GeV/c, 9 GeV/c and 18 GeV/c respectively. Two trigger types are used in the analysis. The \"inclusive\" trigger is based on a signal from a combination of hodoscope signals caused by the scattered muon. The \"semi-inclusive\" trigger requires an energy deposition in one of the hadron calorimeters. The experimental set-up is described in more detail in Ref. [32]. The data selection criteria are kept similar to those used in the recently published analyses [10,12] whenever possible. In order to formally ensure the applicability of the pQCD formalism, the DIS region is selected by requiring Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 and W > 5 GeV/c 2 for the invariant mass of the produced hadronic system. The fraction of the incoming muon energy carried by the virtual photon, y, is kept larger than 0.1 to avoid the region with degraded momentum resolution.",

The proton selection, which was improved with respect to our earlier papers, ensures that the contamination from \u03c0 and K can be safely neglected. Upper limits to such a possible contamination are taken into account in the systematic uncertainty. The acceptance correction factors A p for p and p are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. The same unfolding method is used as in Ref. [12], i.e., in a given (x, Q 2 ) bin we calculate the ratio of the number of reconstructed events to that of generated ones. Note that in order to count generated (reconstructed) events, generated (reconstructed) variables are used. As for z unfolding, we present the results as a function of z corr , which denotes the value of z reconstructed in the experiment, corrected by the average difference between the generated and reconstructed values of z rec , where the latter are determined by Monte Carlo simulations. The average acceptance ratio for the first x-bin is Ap/ A p = 0.912 \u00b1 0.004 (stat.) and a similar value is obtained for the second x-bin. The systematic uncertainty related to the acceptance ratio is discussed in the next section. It is also verified by using the DJANGOH Monte Carlo generator [34] that in the COMPASS kinematics the radiative correction for positive and negative particles is of the same value within uncertainties, thus it cancels in the ratio. Compared to the above proton analysis and the kaon analysis presented in Ref. [12], the raw K \u00b1 yields are obtained in a different way, which is described below. After that, the present analysis follows closely the same procedure as in the case of the proton analysis and the one from Ref. [12]. With respect to the proton analysis described above it is in addition verified using simulations that the contamination from diffractive vector meson decays (e.g. \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) and charm meson decays is negligible.",

However, by improving the RICH particle-identification software a better separation between \u03c0 and K can be achieved at higher momenta. For the present analysis, the polar angle \u03b8 of the Cherenkov photon rings is corrected by a Neural Networks (NN) parametrisation, which intends to improve the internal description of the RICH sub-structure with respect to what was known during the original data production and the reconstruction. This correction depends upon various track parameters like position and angle at the RICH entrance, momentum of the particle etc. and is applied on an event-by-event basis. In the left panel of Fig. 1, we recall from our earlier analysis [12] the likelihood ratio for the K/\u03c0 hypothesis in the highest momentum bin, where the separation was most challenging. In order to optimise the uncertainties of R K , a lower limit of 1.5 was used there. Using in the present analysis the NN method, the separation of kaons and pions is improved considerably as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 1, where the \u03b8 distribution after the NN correction is shown for the same events as in the left panel. A much better separation of the two particle species is clearly visible, which allows us to extend the analysis to higher momenta up to 55 GeV/c.",

Right panel: reconstructed angle of Cherenkov photons in the \"ring fit\" after the NN correction (which is used in the present analysis), for the same experimental data as shown in the left panel. Here, a much cleaner separation between K and \u03c0 is visible. a source of non-negligible systematic uncertainties, especially at higher z and higher momenta. The systematic uncertainty related to this extraction is described in Section 5. It is verified that the results obtained with the new method agree in the overlapping kinematic region with those previously published [12]. Hence, whenever possible, already published results on R K are used throughout the present paper, while the new results on R K are only given for the newly explored kaon momentum range between 40 GeV/c and 55 GeV/c.",

This result is expected as for the lowest proton energy analysed (20 GeV) calorimeter efficiencies are already close to 100%. More complex methods of unfolding the acceptance were tested in Ref. [12], as well as in the present analysis. They are giving very similar results when compared to the selected method, but their resulting covariance matrix has large off-diagonal elements.

On top of that, some performed tests are limited in precision due to the small statistics, especially for anti-protons at larger momenta and/or larger values of z. iii) As in previous studies, the stability of R p is tested on data using several variables that are defined in the spectrometer coordinate system. A clear instability is seen in the dependence of R p upon the azimuthal angle measured in the laboratory frame, as it was the case in our earlier analysis of R K . In Ref. [12], this asymmetry led to a systematic uncertainty of up to 12% in both x-bins. In this analysis, for data binned in x and z, the systematic uncertainty amounts up to 5% for the 1st x-bin and up to 11% in the 2nd x-bin.

[12], a new type of systematic uncertainty has to be studied, which is related to the new method of extracting the raw kaon yields from RICH data. First, it is verified that the results obtained with the new method do agree with those previously published [12]. Various combinations of functional forms are used in the fit, e.g. the main results are obtained using a Gaussian functional form to fit the polar angle distribution of the kaon and two Gaussian functions for the one of the pion. With three Gaussian functions to describe the po-lar angle distribution of photons in the RICH detector, there are nine free parameters in every single z and hadron momentum bin, and for each of the two hadron charges. The fit in certain bins (at large z and large momentum) results in very large uncertainties on the obtained values of R K . In order to improve accuracy, studies are performed to determine which parameters can be kept common for the two charges and across various z and momentum bins. For example, the pion and kaon Cherenkov opening angles depend only on the particle momenta but not on z. Indeed, it is confirmed in the fit that this angle is independent on z within uncertainties. Altogether, the initial 450 free parameters in the fit are reduced by about a factor of three. The systematic uncertainty of the final results on R K is evaluated by performing several fits, in which the number of free parameters is increased by releasing certain constraints. As a systematic uncertainty, half of the difference between maximum and minimum value of R K obtained in these studies is taken. The resulting relative uncertainty of the kaon yield is found to range between 4% and 25%.",

Using in the proton analysis the MSTW08L PDF set [17] and the DSS FF set [5], at average values of x and Q 2 the ratio R K /R p is expected to be about 1.10 \u00b1 0.05 in LO pQCD. 2 As mentioned above, the x and Q 2 distributions from the proton and kaon analyses are different, which turns out to reduce the expected value of the R K /R p ratio by about 5% to 10%. Thus in LO pQCD one would expect the proton and kaon data points shown in Fig. 3 to agree within better than 5%, which is clearly not the case.",

            "text": "In this article the p over p multiplicity ratio R p , obtained from semi-inclusive measurements of deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering at z-values above 0.5, is presented for the first time. In the whole studied z-region the ratio R p is observed to be below the lower limit predicted by LO pQCD. It is found to be significantly smaller than the K \u2212 over K + multiplicity ratio R K as presented in our previous Letter, while in LO pQCD both ratios are expected to be very similar. A strong dependence on the virtualphoton energy \u03bd is observed, which is also not expected by LO pQCD but was already seen for the ratio R K in our earlier analysis. The results of the proton analysis are compared to the prediction of LO pQCD. However, based on the experience with kaons it is unlikely that higher-order corrections alone will allow one to reconcile the presented proton results with pQCD predictions. In this article, the analysis of R K is extended to larger values of \u03bd up to 70 GeV. The obtained results suggest that for high \u03bd values there is an indication for saturation of R K at or above the value predicted by the NLO pQCD lower limit. The presented results of both analyses strengthen our earlier conclusion that at COMPASS energies the phase space available for single-hadron production in deep-inelastic scattering should be taken into account in the standard pQCD formalism. When using this approach, factorisation in the current-fragmentation region should work better at high z, opposite to the trend visible in our data. We hence hope that our results will evoke greater attention of theorists to the validation of the factorisation theorem for the SIDIS cross section at moderate energies.",
