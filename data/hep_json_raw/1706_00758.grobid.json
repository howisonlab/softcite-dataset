            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM), the unobserved K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay proceeds only through a Flavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) transition, which cannot occur at tree level. It is further suppressed by the small amount of CP violation in kaon decays, since the S-wave component of the decay is forbidden when CP is conserved. In the SM, the decay amplitude is expected to be dominated by long distance contributions, which can be constrained using the observed decays K 0 S \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 \u03b3 , leading to the prediction for the branching fraction B(K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (5.0 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10 \u221212 [1,2]. The predicted branching fraction for the K 0 L decay is (6.85 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [3], in excellent agreement with the experimental world average B(K 0 L \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (6.84 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [4]. The prediction for K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 is currently being updated with a dispersive treatment, which leads to sizeable corrections in other K 0 S leptonic decays [5]. Due to its suppression in the SM, the K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay is sensitive to possible contributions from dynamics beyond the SM, notably from light scalars with CP-violating Yukawa couplings [1]. Contributions up to one order of magnitude above the SM branching fraction expectation naturally arise in many models and are compatible with the present bounds from other FCNC processes. An upper limit e-mail: jessica.prisciandaro@cern.ch on B(K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) close to 10 \u221211 could be translated into model-independent bounds on the CP-violating phase of the s \u2192 d + \u2212 amplitude [2]. This would be very useful to discriminate between scenarios beyond the SM if other modes, such as K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd, indicate a non-SM enhancement.",

Candidates are subsequently classified as TOS, if the event is triggered on the signal candidate, or TIS, if triggered by other activities in the detector, independently of signal. Only candidates that are classified as TOS at each trigger stage are used to search for K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays. The trigger selection constitutes the main limitation to the efficiency for detecting K 0 S decays. A muon is only selected at the hardware stage when it is detected in all muon stations and a rough momentum estimation is provided. Trigger requirements at this stage imply a momentum larger than about 5 GeV/c, and a p T above 1.76 GeV/c. These thresholds have an efficiency of order 1% for K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays. In the first step of the software trigger, all charged particles with p T > 500 MeV/c are reconstructed. At this stage most signal decays are triggered either by requiring a reconstructed track loosely identified as a muon [10,11], with IP > 0.1 mm and p T > 1.0 GeV/c, or by finding two oppositely charged muon candidates forming a detached secondary vertex (SV). Since these two categories, hereafter referred to as TOS \u03bc and TOS \u03bc\u03bc , induce different kinematic biases on the signal and background candidates, the analysis steps described below are performed independently on each category. The two categories are made mutually exclusive by applying the TOS \u03bc\u03bc selection only to candidates not already selected by TOS \u03bc .",

Due to the trigger reoptimisation, no mass requirements were applied during 2012 and a lower p T threshold for reconstructed tracks was used. According to simulation, these changes improve the trigger efficiency over the previous analysis [6] by about a factor 2.5.

Combinatorial background candidates are expected to exhibit a smooth mass distribution, and can therefore be estimated from the sidebands. The other relevant source of background is due to K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays where both pions pass the loose muon identification requirements after the trigger stage. This can be due either to \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc decays or to random association of muon detector hits with the pion trajectory. In such cases the K 0 S mass, reconstructed with a wrong mass hypothesis for the final-state particles, is underestimated by 39 MeV/c 2 on average, as shown in Fig. 1. Despite the excellent mass resolution, the right-hand tail of the reconstructed mass distribution under the dimuon hypothesis extends into the K 0 S signal mass range and, given the large branching fraction of the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode, constitutes a nonnegligible background. Two multivariate discriminants, based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm [21,22], are applied on the preselected candidates to improve the signal discrimination with respect to these backgrounds. The first discriminant, named hereafter BDT cb , aims to reduce the combinatorial background, exploiting the different decay topologies, kinematic spectra and reconstruction qualities of signal and combinatorial candidates. It is optimised separately for each trigger category. The algorithm used for both categories is XGBoost [23], with a learning rate of 0.02 and a maximum depth of 4. The optimal number of estimators is 2000 and 800 for the TOS \u03bc and TOS \u03bc\u03bc trigger categories, respectively. A set of ten input variables is used in BDT cb : the K 0 S p T and IP, the minimum IP of the two charged tracks, the angle between the positively charged final-state particle in the K 0 S rest frame and the axis defined by the K 0 S boost direction, the \u03c7 2 of the SV fit, the distance of closest approach between the two tracks, an SV isolation variable, defined as the difference in vertex-fit \u03c7 2 when the next nearest track is included in the vertex fit, and the SV absolute position coordinates. The SV position is particularly important, since a large fraction of the background is found to originate from interactions in the detector material. This set of variables does not distinguish between K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays as it does not contain quantities related to muon identification and ignores the K 0 S candidate invariant mass distribution.",

The mass distribution of simulated signal candidates is best described by a Hypatia function [28]. Its parameters are determined from simulation and fixed in the fit to data. In the background model, a power law function describes the tail of the double-misidentification background from K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, affecting the mass region below the K 0 S mass, while the combinatorial background mass distribution is described by an exponential function.

An alternative combinatorial background shape, based on a linear function, is used instead of the exponential function to determine a systematic uncertainty due to the choice of the background shape. The signal yields in each BDT bin for the two trigger categories are all compatible with the absence of K 0 S \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidates.
