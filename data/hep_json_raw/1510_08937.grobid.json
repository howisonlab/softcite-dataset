            "text": "The Double Chooz collaboration presents a measurement of the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 using reactor \u03bd e observed via the inverse beta decay reaction in which the neutron is captured on hydrogen. This measurement is based on 462.72 live days data, approximately twice as much data as in the previous such analysis, collected with a detector positioned at an average distance of 1050 m from two reactor cores. Several novel techniques have been developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties. Accidental coincidences, the dominant background in this analysis, are suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect to our previous publication by a multi-variate analysis. These improvements demonstrate the capability of precise measurement of reactor \u03bd e without gadolinium loading. Spectral distortions from the \u03bd e reactor flux predictions previously reported with the neutron capture on gadolinium events are confirmed in the independent data sample presented here. A value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.095 +0.038   \u22120.039 (stat+syst) is obtained from a fit to the observed event rate as a function of the reactor power, a method insensitive to the energy spectrum shape. A simultaneous fit of the hydrogen capture events and of the gadolinium capture events yields a measurement of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.088 \u00b1 0.033(stat+syst).",

Current reactor experiments, including Double Chooz [4], which aim to measure \u03b8 13 dope their scintillator with gadolinium to benefit from its large neutron capture cross-section resulting in a fast capture time and high energy, about 8 MeV in total, of its released \u03b3-rays. These properties are used to suppress the background from accidental coincidence of natural radioactivity occurring at lower energies, thus justifying the use of gadolinium despite the resulting higher cost and lower light yield due to admixture of gadolinium. In addition, Double Chooz published the first measurement of \u03b8 13 using neutron captures on hydrogen [5], in which the released \u03b3-ray carries only 2.2 MeV, an energy well within the range of natural radioactivity thus leading to sizable background.",

The signal to background ratio was improved from 0.93 to 9.7, more than an order of magnitude, using novel background reduction techniques including accidental background rejection with a neural-network based algorithm. It uses the same exposure as the recently published \u03b8 13 measurement based on n-Gd capture events [4] but accumulates about twice the number of events given the 2.2 times larger undoped scintillator volume. As a consequence of improvements on the systematic uncertainties on the detection efficiency, energy scale and estimate of residual backgrounds, the total uncertainty on the IBD rate measurement was reduced from 3.1% to 2.3% of which 1.7% is associated with the reactor flux prediction. The value of \u03b8 13 is extracted together with the total background rate by fitting the observed IBD rate as a function of the predicted rate, which depends on the reactor power. This method is independent of the reactor \u03bd e flux energy distribution, a fact that became important after the observation of unexpected distortions of the reactor flux at about 6 MeV \u03bd e energy [4,9,10]. Double Chooz is particularly well suited for this technique as it is illuminated by only two reactors and variations in reactor power or the turning off of one reactor results in substantial flux variations. In addition, during about seven days both reactors were turned off, leading to a very useful direct measurement of the background. As a cross check a consistent value of \u03b8 13 was also obtained using a fit to the positron energy distribution in spite of the spectrum distortion.",

The volumes of the GC and Buffer are 22.3 m 3 and 110 m 3 , respectively. The NT and GC vessels are made of transparent acrylic with thickness of 8 mm and 12 mm, respectively, while the Buffer volume is surrounded by a steel tank on the inner surface of which are positioned 390 low background 10-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). They detect scintillation light from energy depositions in the NT and GC. Most of the neutron captures on hydrogen occur in the GC, in contrast with the NT where \u223c85% occur on gadolinium because of its large capture cross section. The Buffer works as a shield to \u03b3-rays from radioactivity of PMTs and surrounding rock. These inner three regions and PMTs are collectively referred to as the inner detector (ID). Outside of the ID is the inner veto (IV), a 50 cm thick liquid scintillator layer viewed by 78 8-inch PMTs, used as a veto to cosmic ray muons and as a shield as well as an active veto to neutrons and \u03b3-rays from outside the detector. The detector is surrounded by a 15 cm thick steel shield to protect it against external \u03b3-rays. A central chimney allows the introduction of the liquids and of calibration sources, which can be deployed vertically down into the NT from a glove box at the detector top. The calibration sources can be also deployed into the GC using a motor-driven wire attached to the source and guided through a rigid hermetic looped tube (GT).

The first is corrected for by comparing the detector response to the 2.2 MeV \u03b3-rays from n-H captures and to the 8 MeV release of n-Gd captures. As the average energy of \u03b3-rays emitted in n-Gd captures is about 2.2 MeV, an energy almost the same to that of the \u03b3-ray from n-H capture, the discrepancy of the energy response between the data and MC can be understood to be due to charge integration rather than to scintillator light yield. After the charge non-linearity is corrected, the residual non-linearity is attributed to the scintillator light non-linearity. It is evaluated by comparing the measured energy of \u03b3's of known energy from various sources in the data and MC. As shown in figure 1, it differs between the NT and GC as they are filled with different scintillators. Unlike the previous publication using neutrons captures on gadolinium occurring in the NT, scintillator light non-linearity is not corrected for in the n-H sample. Instead, in the Rate+Shape fit using the energy spectrum of the prompt positron signal (section 7.1), the uncertainty on the scintillator light non-linearity is taken to cover the possible variation evaluated by the source calibration data and is left to be determined within the fit to the energy spectrum. We confirmed the output parameters for the non-linearity correction obtained from a R+S fit to the n-Gd sample with this new approach are consistent with the correction we applied in the previous publication. The systematic uncertainty on the energy scale at 1.0 MeV (lower cut of the prompt energy window) is evaluated to be 1.0%, which results in the IBD rate uncertainty of 0.1% caused by the prompt energy cut.",

One of the two \u03b3-rays from the annihilation of a positron produced by an IBD interaction in the buffer volume often enters the GC. In our gadolinium analysis the lower cut was 0.5 MeV as these buffer events would not be selected as IBD candidates as it is unlikely for a neutron produced in the buffer to travel as far as the NT to be captured on gadolinium. In this analysis however one of the two \u03b3-rays from buffer could be identified as a prompt signal peaking at 0.5 MeV if it is followed by a delayed signal due to the neutron capture on hydrogen in the GC or the buffer. A cut at 0.5 MeV would include only partially this \u03b3 signal. Since reducing the cut would run into our trigger threshold of 0.35 MeV, it was decided instead to exclude these \u03b3's by increasing the lower cut to 1.0 MeV. The prompt signal from reactor \u03bd e extends to around 8 MeV while the energy window is extended up to 20 MeV to better constrain the background due to cosmogenic isotopes and fast neutrons (FN) using their different energy spectrum shapes.",

The network structure included an input layer with four nodes (three input variables +1 bias node, whose value is constant and the weight is adjusted during the training to optimize the output), a single hidden layer with 9 nodes and a single output parameter.

The difference between off-time and on-time data is seen to agree very well with the MC signal, also shown in the figure.

The prompt spectrum of IBD candidates (black) and the accidental background (red) are shown in figure 4 (right) before and after the ANN cut, clearly demonstrating its effectiveness.

The implementation rationale of the IV veto definition is similar to that of the n-Gd analysis [4], but with major improvements specific to the n-H capture sample. IBD candidates are IV-tagged and rejected if either or both of the prompt and delayed signals satisfy the following requirements: IV PMT hit multiplicity \u2265 2 (where a PMT hit is defined as 0.2 p.e.), energy deposition in the IV 0.2 MeV, energy depositions in the IV and ID reconstructed within 4.0 m in space and 90 ns in time of each other. Despite the fact that the IV, being the outermost layer, is exposed to a large rate (> 100 ks \u22121 ) of surrounding rock radioactivity, threshold-less PMT signal recording by the IV FADC allows to observe such small, 2 PMT hit, signals caused by energy deposition in the IV by \u03b3 and fast neutrons from surrounding rock.

Muons are divided into sub-samples according to their energy in the ID (E \u00b5 ), as the probability of generating Li increases with E \u00b5 . After subtraction of the random background determined from a sample of off-time muon-IBD coincidences, the sample above 600 MeV * 2 is the only one that can generate a sufficiently pure sample of Li without applying cuts on the distance (d) between the muon and the prompt signal. The lateral distance profile (LDP) was evaluated by a simple simulation as follows: a) generated muon-IBD coincidences separated by an exponential distribution of d with an averaged distance \u03bb, b) implemented the reconstruction resolution of the two deposits and c) applied the acceptance of the detector.  Fitting the resulting LDP to the data yielded a \u03bb of 491 mm from which acceptance corrected probability density functions (pdf's) of the LDP for each E \u00b5 sub-sample could be generated. A Li sample was then obtained from the data, divided into several ranges of E \u00b5 and restricted to coincidences with 0 \u2264 d \u2264 d max . The efficiency of the d max cut was evaluated from the generated pdf's. Several samples were obtained by varying d max between 400 and 1000 mm, evaluating the Li rate for each sample through a fit of its \u2206T \u00b5 distribution using exponentials describing the cosmogenic decays and a flat background. The average and rms of these rates were taken, respectively, as a measure of the Li contribution, R Li , and its systematic error: R Li = 2.76 +0.43 \u22120.39 (stat) \u00b1 0.23(syst) events/day. As an alternative approach, the minimum contamination of the Li background was estimated by a Li-enriched sample selected as the sum of two samples: 1)E \u00b5 > 400 MeV * and one or more neutron candidates 2) E \u00b5 > 500 MeV * , no neutron candidate and d < 1000 mm. A fit to the resulting \u2206T \u00b5 distribution, shown in figure 7, gives a minimum Li rate of 2.26 \u00b1 0.15 events/day.

As explained in section 2, the normalisation of the reactor flux is constrained by the Bugey4 measurement [21]. The precision of the RRM analysis is improved by including the reactor-off data. The R+S analysis is based on a fit to the observed energy spectrum in which both the rate of IBD candidates and their spectral shape are used to constrain \u03b8 13 as well as the background contributions, the latter by extending the fitted spectrum well above the IBD region.

A scan of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is carried out minimizing the \u03c7 2 with respect to the total background rate and three systematic uncertainty parameters for each value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . The best-fit is for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.095 +0.038 \u22120.039 and a total background rate of B = 7.27 \u00b1 0.49 events/day where the uncertainty is given as the range of \u03c7 2 < \u03c7 2 min + 1.0 with \u03c7 2 min /d.o.f. = 7.4/6. The observed rate is plotted as a function of the expected rate in figure 10 (left) together with the best fit and no-oscillation expectation.",

This sample has approximately a factor of 2 more statistics than our previous hydrogen capture publication [5]. It is independent of the corresponding sample obtained via neutron captures on gadolinium. Several novel background reduction techniques were developed including accidental background rejection based on a neural-network and on a tagging of \u03b3 Compton scattering in the Inner Veto, and a new cut against fast neutron background using the waveform recorded by the Flash-ADC readout. These results in a predicted signal to total background ratio of 9.7, a big improvement over the ratio of 0.93 achieved in our earlier hydrogen capture publication. The systematic uncertainty on the IBD rate measurement was improved from 3.1% to 2.3%, of which 1.7% is associated with the reactor flux prediction. This was achieved by the reductions of uncertainty on the background estimates, mainly cosmogenic 9 Li + 8 He (from 1.6% to 0.7%) and fast neutron + stopping muon (from 0.6% to 0.2%), detection systematics (from 1.6% to 1.0%) and reduction of statistical uncertainty including accidental background subtraction (from 1.1% to 0.6%).",

To be independent of this structure, this publication has focussed JHEP01(2016)163 on a measurement of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 based on the event rate as a function of reactor flux (RRM), which does not depend on the shape of the positron energy distribution. The analysis, which includes a data sample obtained with both reactors off and uses the background estimates as input, yields a value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.095 +0.038 \u22120.039 (stat+syst). A cross check of this measurement based on an analysis of the rate + shape of our data results in a consistent value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . Finally, the RRM method was applied jointly to our hydrogen and gadolinium capture samples resulting in sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.088 \u00b1 0.033(stat+syst).",

The discrepancy of the efficiency between the data and MC is found to be (0.05 \u00b1 0.17) %, where the uncertainty includes a statistical component (0.13%), a contribution from the accidental correction factor (0.01%) and a systematic uncertainty (0.11%), estimated as the change in the correction when only IBD candidates in the lower half of the detector are used. Since no significant discrepancy is observed, the correction factor is taken as c Eff = 1.0000 \u00b1 0.0022. A consistent number is obtained using Cf source data.",

Spill effects are predominantly affected by neutron modeling, itself dependent on the treatment of molecular bonds between hydrogen and other atoms, implemented through a patch in our Geant4 simulation. To estimate the spill systematic uncertainty we have compared Geant4 to another simulation [26], TRIPOLI-4, known for its accurate modeling of low energy neutron physics. Since TRIPOLI-4 does not include radiative photon generation and scintillation light production and propagation, for each TRIPOLI-4 event the visible delayed energy and the prompt to delayed distance were built based on Geant4 distributions. Events were generated in all detector volumes and the number of prompt events in each volume in TRIPOLI-4 was normalized to match that in Geant4. After propagating the positron and neutron the number of spill events in the two simulations differed by 0.18% of the total number of generated events, a measure of the spill uncertainty. The possible inadequacy of Geant4 distributions to apply to TRIPOLI-4 events introduced an additional 0.22% uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties associated with the energy scale and statistical uncertainties of the simulations are found to be 0.07% and 0.03%, respectively. Taken together, these uncertainties gave a total spill uncertainty of 0.29% and a correction factor of c Sio = 1.0000 \u00b1 0.0029.",

The uncertainty arises mostly from the GC, which was originally not considered as a target for IBD interactions, and hence affects the detection of n-H capture signals. The proton number uncertainty in the GC includes the contributions of the mass estimation from a geometrical survey of the acrylic vessels combined with liquid density measurements and the hydrogen fraction determination in the GC scintillator. Among these, the uncertainty is dominated by the measurement of the hydrogen fraction, which was determined using elemental analysis of the liquid mixture.  Table 6.

This value is consistent with the RRM measurements of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 reported in the following sections. As expected, the large value of \u03c7 2 is due primarily to the 4.25-5.75 MeV region. Excluding the points in this region, as well as their contributions through correlations with other energy bins via the covariance matrix, reduces the \u03c7 2 to 30.7 for 32 d.o.f.. In order to examine the impact of the spectral distortion to the measured \u03b8 13 value, a test R+S fit was carried out with narrower prompt energy window between 1.0 and 4.0 MeV. The variation of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 was well within 1-\u03c3 of the measured uncertainty. The input and output best-fit values of the fit parameters and their uncertainties are summarized in table 6, demonstrating the reduction in the uncertainties achieved by the fit.
