With full reconstruction of the D meson pair and the bachelor \u03c0 \u00b1 in the final state, we confirm the existence of the charged structure Zc(3885) \u2213 in the (DD * ) \u2213 system in the two isospin processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D \u2212 D * 0 . By performing a simultaneous fit, the statistical significance of Zc(3885) \u2213 signal is determined to be greater than 10\u03c3, and its pole mass and width are measured to be M pole =(3881.7\u00b11.6(stat.)\u00b11.6(syst.)) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 pole =(26.6\u00b12.0(stat.)\u00b12.1(syst.)) MeV, respectively. The Born cross section times the (DD * ) \u2213 branching fraction (\u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 Zc(3885) \u2213 ) \u00d7 Br(Zc(3885) \u2213 \u2192 (DD * ) \u2213 )) is measured to be (141.6 \u00b1 7.9(stat.) \u00b1 12.3(syst.)) pb at \u221a s = 4.23 GeV and (108.4 \u00b1 6.9(stat.) \u00b1 8.8(syst.)) pb at \u221a s = 4.26 GeV. The polar angular distribution of the \u03c0 \u00b1 -Zc(3885) \u2213 system is consistent with the expectation of a quantum number assignment of J P = 1 + for Zc(3885) \u2213 . ",

This observation was subsequently confirmed by CLEO [2] and Belle [3]. Unlike other charmonium states, such as \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415), Y (4260) does not have a natural place within the quark model of charmonium [4]. Many theoretical interpretations have been proposed to understand the underlying structure of Y (4260) [5][6][7], more precise experiments are necessary to give a decisive conclusion.",

            "text": "In recent years, a common pattern has been observed for the charmoniumlike states in the systems \u03c0J/\u03c8, \u03c0\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c0h c and \u03c0\u03c7 c as well as in pairs of charmed mesons DD * and D * D * . Belle observed some charged structures called Z(4430) \u00b1 in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8 \u2032 system [8][9][10], and Z 1 (4050) \u00b1 and Z 2 (4250) \u00b1 in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c7 c1 invariant mass spectra [11] in B meson decays. The Z(4430) \u00b1 has recently been confirmed by LHCb [12] in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8 \u2032 system. However, neither Z 1 (4050) \u00b1 nor Z 2 (4250) \u00b1 are found to be significant in BaBar data [13,14]. BESIII [15] and Belle [16] observed the Z c (3900) \u00b1 in the \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution in a study of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8; this observation was confirmed with CLEOc data at \u221a s=4.17 GeV [17]. More recently, BESIII has reported the observations of the Z c (3900) 0 in the \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 system [18], Z c (4020) in the \u03c0h c system [19,20], Z c (4025) in the D * D * system [21,22], and Z c (3885) \u00b1 in the (DD * ) \u00b1 system [23]. It is interesting to note that all these states lie close to the threshold of some charm meson pair systems and some of them even have overlapping widths. It is therefore important to obtain more experimental information to improve the understanding of all these states.",

That study employs a partial reconstruction technique by reconstructing one final-state D meson and the bachelor \u03c0 coming directly from e + e \u2212 decay (\"single D tag\"or ST) and inferring the presence of theD * from energy-momentum conservation. In this analysis, we present a combined study of the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 (\u03c0 + D 0D0tagged) and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0  24] collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring (charge conjugated processes are included throughout this paper). We reconstruct the bachelor \u03c0 + and the D meson pair (\"double D tag\"or DT) in the final state. Because the \u03c0 from D * \u2212 and D * 0 decays has low momentum, it is difficult to reconstruct directly. We denote it as the \"missing \u03c0\" and infer its presence using energy-momentum conservation. The D 0 mesons are reconstructed in four decay modes and the D \u2212 mesons in six decay modes. The double D tag technique allows the use of more D decay modes and effectively suppresses backgrounds.",

There is no similar peak found near 3.9 GeV/c 2 and the selected events predominantly have the same final states as \u03c0 + (DD * ) \u2212 .

To examine this possibility, the events are separated into two samples according to | cos \u03b8 \u03c0D | < 0.5 and | cos \u03b8 \u03c0D | > 0.5, where \u03b8 \u03c0D is the angle between the directions of the bachelor \u03c0 + and the D meson in the DD * rest frame. Defining the asymmetry A = (n >0.5 \u2212 n <0.5 )/(n >0.5 + n <0.5 ), where n >0.5 and n <0.5 are the numbers of events in each sample, we found that the asymmetry in data, A data =0.11\u00b10.07, is compatible with the asymmetry expected in signal MC, A \u03c0Zc MC =0.01\u00b10.01, and incompatible with the expectations for DD 1 (2420) MC, A DD1 MC =0.43\u00b10.01. Considering the kinematic boundary of this process, we conclude that the DD 1 (2420) contribution to our observed Born cross section is smaller than its relative systematic uncertainty.

The mass and width of Z c are set to be 3890 MeV/c 2 and 0 MeV, respectively. The mass resolution for the \u03c0 + D 0D0 -tagged process is described by a Crystal Ball (CB) function [37]. Since the \u03c0 + D \u2212 D 0 -tagged process contains two isospin processes, the mass resolution is represented by a sum of two CB functions with a common mean and different widths. The fit results for both processes are shown in Fig. 5.

The angular distribution of the \u03c0 + \u2212 Z c (3885) \u2212 system is consistent with the expectation from a J P = 1 + quantum number assignment. We perform a simultaneous fit to the (DD * ) \u2212 mass spectra for the two isospin processes of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D \u2212 D * 0 using a mass-dependent Breit Wigner function. The statistical significance of the Z c (3885) signal is greater than 10\u03c3. The pole mass and pole width of Z c (3885) \u2212 are determined to be M pole =(3881.7\u00b11.6(stat.)\u00b11.6(syst.))
