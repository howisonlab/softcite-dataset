The W boson is modeled as a heavy W boson, but different scenarios for the couplings to fermions are considered, involving both left-handed and right-handed chiral projections of the fermions, as well as an arbitrary mixture of the two. The search is performed in the decay channel W \u2192 tb, leading to a final state signature with a single electron or muon, missing transverse energy, and jets, at least one of which is identified as a b-jet. A W boson that couples to the right-handed (left-handed) chiral projections of the fermions with the same coupling constants as the W is excluded for masses below 1.85 (1.51) TeV at the 95% confidence level. For the first time using LHC data, constraints on the W gauge couplings for a set of left-and right-handed coupling combinations have been placed. These results represent a significant improvement over previously published limits.",

            "text": "New charged massive gauge bosons, usually called W , are predicted by various extensions of the standard model (SM), for example [1][2][3][4]. In contrast to the W boson, which couples only to left-handed fermions, the couplings of the W boson may be purely left-handed, purely right-handed, or a mixture of the two, depending on the model. Direct searches for W bosons have been conducted in leptonic final states and have resulted in lower limits for the W mass of 2.15 TeV [5] and 2.5 TeV [6], obtained at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS and CMS experiments respectively. CMS has also searched for the process W \u2192 WZ using the fully leptonic final states and has excluded W bosons with masses below 1.14 TeV [7]. For W bosons that couple only to right-handed fermions, the decay to leptons will be suppressed if the mass of the right-handed neutrino is larger than the mass of the W boson. In that scenario, the limits from the leptonic searches do not apply. Thus it is important to search for W bosons also in quark final states. Searches for dijet resonances by CMS [8] have led to the limit M(W ) > 1.5 TeV.",

The interference term may contribute as much as 5-20% of the total rate, depending on the W mass and its couplings [14]. The most recent D0 analysis [11], in which arbitrary admixtures of left-and right-handed couplings are considered, and interference effects are included, sets a lower limit on the W mass of 0.89 (0.86) TeV, assuming purely right-handed (left-handed) couplings.

The fraction of heavy flavor events (Wbb, Wcc) is scaled by an additional empirical correction derived using lepton + jets samples with various jet multiplicities [38]. Since this correction was obtained for events with a different topology than those selected in this analysis, an additional correction factor is derived using two data samples: events containing zero b-quark jets (0-b-tagged sample) and the inclusive sample after all the selection criteria, excluding any b-tagging requirement (preselection sample). Both samples are background dominated with negligible signal contribution.

This method, based on judicious selection of Table 2 Number of events observed, and number of signal and background events predicted. For the background samples, the expectation is computed corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 . The total background yields include the normalization uncertainty on the predicted backgrounds. \"Additional selection\" corresponds to requirements of the W invariant mass analysis (described in Section 5.1) and are: discriminating variables, provides a considerable increase in sensitivity for the W search compared to the W invariant mass analysis, described in Section 5.1. The discriminating variables used for the BDT analysis fall into the following categories: object kinematics such as individual transverse momentum (p T ) or pseudorapidity (\u03b7) variables; event kinematics, e.g. total transverse energy or invariant mass variables; angular correlations, either R, angles \u03c6 between jets and leptons, or top-quark spin correlation variables; and top-quark reconstruction variables identifying which jets to use for the top quark reconstruction. The final set of variables chosen for this analysis is shown in Table 3. The \"jet 1,2,3,4 \" corresponds to first, second, third and fourth highest p T jet; \"btag 1,2 \" corresponds to first, second highest p T b-tagged jet; \"notbest 1,2 \" corresponds to highest and second highest p T jet not used in the reconstruction of best top candidate. Class \"alljets\" includes all the jets in the event in the global variable. The sum of the transverse energies is H T . The invariant mass of the objects is M. The transverse mass of the objects is M T . The sum of z-components of the momenta of all jets is p z . The angle between x and y, is cos(x, y) r where the subscript indicates the reference frame.",

The selection of the final list of input variables uses important components from the BDT training procedure, namely the ranking of variables in the order of their importance and correlations among these variables. In order to maximize the information and keep the training optimal, the variables with smallest correlations are selected. The final list of variables is determined through an iterative process of training and selection (based on ranking and correlations), and the degree of agreement between the data and MC in two background-dominated regions (W + jets and tt). While the relative importance of the various variables used by the BDT depends on the W mass, for a 2 TeV W R , the four most important variables are cos(best, lepton) besttop , M(alljets), \u03c6(lepton, jet1), and p T (jet1). The W + jets dominated sample is defined by requiring exactly two jets, at least one btagged jet, and the scalar sum of the transverse energies of all kinematic objects in the event to be less than 300 GeV.

The first category includes uncertainties on the integrated luminosity (2.2%) [43], theoretical cross-sections and branching fractions (15%), object identification efficiencies (3%), and trigger modeling (3%). The uncertainty in the W cross section is about 8.5% and includes contributions from the NLO scale (3.3%), PDFs (7.6%), \u03b1 s (1.3%), and the top-quark mass (< 1%). Also included in this group are uncertainties related to obtaining the heavy-flavor ratio from data [38]. In the limit estimation, these are defined through log-normal priors based on their mean values and their uncertainties. The shape-changing category includes the uncertainty from the jet energy scale, the b-tagging efficiency and misidentification rate scale factors. For the W + jets samples, uncertainties on the light-and heavy-flavor scale factors are also included. This uncertainty has the largest impact in the limit estimation. The variation of the factorization scale Q 2 used in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s (Q 2 ), and the jet-parton matching scale [44] uncertainties are evaluated for the tt background sample. In the case of W + jets, there is an additional systematic uncertainty due to the shape difference between data and simulation as observed in the 0-b-tagged sample. These shape uncertainties are evaluated by raising and lowering the corresponding correction by one standard deviation and repeating the complete analysis. Then, a bin-wise interpolation using a cubic spline between histogram templates at the different variations is performed. A nuisance parameter is associated to the interpolation and included in the limit estimation. Systematic uncertainties from a mismodeling of the number of simultaneous primary interactions is found to be negligible in this analysis.",

Templates of the reconstructed W invariant mass distributions are generated for each set of a L , a R , and M(W ) values by weighting the events from the four simulated samples, as described in Section 3, according to Eq. (2). For each of these combinations of a L , a R , and M(W ), we determine the expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the cross section. We then assume values for a L , and a R , and interpolate the cross section limit in the mass value. Fig. 5 shows the contours for the W boson mass in the (a L , a R ) plane for which the cross section limit equals the predicted cross section. For each con-tour of W mass, combinations of the couplings a R and a L above and to the right of the curve are excluded The contours are obtained using the W invariant mass distribution. For this analysis, we make the conservative assumption that M \u03bd R M W . The observed lower limit on the mass of the W boson with coupling to purely left-handed fermions and with couplings to both left-and right-handed fermions with equal strength is listed in Table 4.",
