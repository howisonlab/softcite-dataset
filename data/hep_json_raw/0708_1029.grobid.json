The K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays are reconstructed using techniques described elsewhere [9]. Briefly, K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays can occur anywhere along the spectrometer. Depending on where the decays occur (upstream of the first magnet or inside the magnetic field) and on how many multi-wire proportional chambers each pion passes, the K 0 S are given a type number and the different types vary in mass resolution and in purity. The momentum information from the K 0 S and the charged tracks is used to form a candidate D momentum vector, which is intersected with other tracks to find the primary (production) vertex. Even though it is possible for the production vertex to be identified with a single track plus the D + s momentum vector, the signal quality is greatly improved by demanding at least two primary tracks. Events are selected based on several criteria. The confidence level for the production vertex and for the charm decay vertex must be greater than 1%. The likelihood for each charged particle to be a proton, kaon, pion, or electron based on\u010cerenkov particle identification is used to make additional requirements [10]. We define a \u03c7 2 -like variable W i as \u22122 ln(likelihood i ) for the hypothesis i. In order to reduce background due to secondary interactions of particles from the production vertex, we require the decay vertex to be located outside the target material. We enhance the signal quality by cutting on the isolation variables, Iso1 and Iso2. The isolation variable Iso1 requires that the tracks forming the D candidate vertex have a confidence level smaller than the cut to form a vertex with the tracks from the primary vertex. The isolation variable Iso2 requires that the tracks not assigned to the primary or secondary vertices have a confidence level smaller than the cut to form a vertex with the D candidate daughters.",

To determine the systematic error due to the reconstruction efficiency we follow a procedure based on the S-factor method used by the Particle Data Group [12]. For each mode we split the data sample into two independent subsamples based on D + s momentum, particle versus antiparticle, decays inside the target material versus outside of target material, and on the period of time in which the data was collected. These splits provide a check on the Monte Carlo simulation of charm production, on the vertex detector (which was upgraded during the run), and on the simulation of the detector stability. We then define the split sample variance as the difference between the scaled variance and the statistical variance if the former exceeds the latter. The method is described in detail in reference [13]. We vary the subresonant states in the Monte Carlo and use the variance in the branching ratios as a contribution to the systematic error. We investigate the systematic effects based on different fitting procedures and we find this contribution to be small. The branching ratio is evaluated under various cut selection criteria, and the variance of the results is used as an additional systematic error. The systematic effects are then all added in quadrature to obtain the final systematic error. Table 1 summarizes the contributions to the systematic errors for the",
