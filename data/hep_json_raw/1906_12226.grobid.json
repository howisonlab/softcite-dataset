            "text": "The momentum measurement capability of the ATLAS muon spectrometer relies fundamentally on the intrinsic single-hit spatial resolution of the monitored drift tube precision tracking chambers. Optimal resolution is achieved with a dedicated calibration program that addresses the specific operating conditions of the 354 000 high-pressure drift tubes in the spectrometer. The calibrations consist of a set of timing offsets and drift time to drift distance transfer relations, and result in chamber resolution functions. This paper describes novel algorithms to obtain precision calibrations from data collected by ATLAS in LHC Run 2 and from a gas monitoring chamber, deployed in a dedicated gas facility. The algorithm output consists of a pair of correction constants per chamber which are applied to baseline calibrations, and determined to be valid for the entire ATLAS Run 2. The final single-hit spatial resolution, averaged over 1172 monitored drift tube chambers, is 81.7 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5m.",

Such searches may include the decay of heavy resonances into high transverse momentum (p T ) muons, demanding superior spectrometer performance for their discovery. For muons of p T above 100 GeV, the drift tube single-hit resolution (and to a lesser extent, the chamber alignment) becomes an important contribution to the transverse momentum -1 -resolution, and is the dominant factor above 250 GeV [2]. At high momentum, the p T resolution \u03c3 p T is determined by the relation \u03c3 p T /p T \u221d \u03c3 res \u00d7 p T [4], where \u03c3 res is the single-hit spatial resolution.

The MDT chambers perform precision charged-particle tracking in the plane defined by the beam axis (z) and the radial distance to the beam (r). The momentum measurement is based on the track curvature in these r-z coordinates, while resistive-plate chambers (RPC) and thin-gap chambers (TGC) provide triggering in the barrel and endcaps respectively, and readout of the so called second coordinate in the r-\u03d5 non-bending plane. The MDT chambers are assembled in three nested cylindrical barrel stations and three main coaxial discs in each of the endcap regions. A fourth annulus of endcap chambers covers a limited pseudorapidity region spanning from the barrel to the endcap. They are constructed of pairs of close-packed multilayers of 3 cm diameter cylindrical aluminum drift tubes, 1 m to 6 m long for the inner stations close to the beam and outer stations, respectively. Each multilayer comprises either three or four single planes, depending on the barrel (endcap) chamber radial (Z-axis) position, with each plane containing from 12 to 72 tubes. A 50 \u00b5m diameter anode wire is centered to within 30 \u00b5m of the axis of a 1.46 cm (1.5 cm) inner (outer) radius aluminum tube. The MDT gas is a mixture of 93% Ar and 7% CO 2 plus a few hundred ppm of water vapour at 3 bar pressure. The gas flows in a common trunk line to distribution racks and is fed in parallel to all drift tubes at a rate of roughly one tube volume per day. The total gas throughput to the entire MDT system is about 2 \u00d7 10 6 L/day. The tubes are operated at 3080 V anode voltage to deliver a gas avalanche amplification gain of 20 000.

[10]. The t max is published hourly to the online run monitoring system and to the muon calibration centers. A variation of t max > 1 ns triggers the calculation of a new set of R(t) functions for the track reconstruction. The t max is sensitive to small changes in the gas composition: for example, a 100 ppm absolute increase in water vapour content yields a nearly 7 ns increase in t max [13]. A single 24-hour period of GMC t max data is shown in figure 3, where the stability is better than 1 ns RMS. The GMC t max superimposed with the same quantity determined from the average of all chambers over the 2016 data-taking period is presented in figure 4. A one-time offset of \u221212 ns is applied to compensate for the typical difference in gas temperature between the MDT and the standard URT that range from about 4.5 to 5 K.

The \u03b4t 0 correction method instead optimizes the default t 0 by testing a new, modified t 0 associated with a single chamber simultaneously for all tubes and for all tracks in a data run, while keeping the R(t) function fixed. The algorithm operates on track segments containing at least as many hits as there are drift tube layers in the chamber, i.e. a minimum of six (eight) hits for a six-layer (eight-layer) chamber. The procedure steps through \u03b4t 0 over a range of \u00b110 ns in 0.5 ns steps. At each step, new drift times and drift radii are computed and the segments are re-fit. Importantly, the residuals are evaluated only for hits with drift radii r < 5 mm where the drift velocity is largest, about 50 \u00b5m/ns. By using only these near-wire residuals the procedure is practically insensitive to the R(t) function and avoids compensating for systematic uncertainties which come into play at larger drift radii (see figure 12).    Figure 8 shows the incremental change with each step of the residual RMS widths for the entire range of \u03b4t 0 values relative to the initial t 0 .

            "text": "The \u03b4t 0 correction procedure is applied to 2015 data (the first year of Run 2 operation) using initial t 0 offsets generated by the MDT calibration centers. The \u03b4t 0 corrections obtained in a much higher peak-luminosity November 2015 run, 4.8 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , are shown in figure 9, which reveals an average t 0 global correction of 1.3 ns with a RMS spread of 0.7 ns. The tails of the distribution are populated by a few chambers that were measured to have been constructed with structural non-conformities affecting the internal alignment of the tubes and therefore of the hit positions. The \u03b4t 0 correction tries to compensate for this misalignment.  The determination of the \u03b4t 0 corrections for all MDT chambers was repeated for a selection of data runs that span all data-taking periods in 2016 and 2017. The chamber-averaged \u03b4t 0 corrections for each run are shown in figure 10. At least 1165 out of the total 1172 chambers are included in each data point used for this average, depending on the integrated luminosity of the run. For the 65 runs analysed in 2016 the mean global \u03b4t 0 offset is 1.35 \u00b1 0.05 (RMS) ns, consistent with the result determined from the 2015 data set. The \u03b4t 0 corrections from 2016 are then added to the calibration constants for 2017, so that the algorithm, when applied to the 2017 data set, produces a smaller global shift with a mean of 0.43 \u00b1 0.07 (RMS) ns. Figure 11 shows the chamber-by-chamber \u03b4t 0 difference between the first and last runs of the 2017 data set. In the first run, the toroid magnetic field was off and in the last run the field was at full strength and the instantaneous luminosity was higher by one order of magnitude. The mean difference is consistent with zero. This result demonstrates that the \u03b4t 0 parameter, once established, remains stable for all chambers over a large range of instantaneous luminosity and is insensitive to the magnetic field.",

            "text": "Optimization of the R(t) functions is done with an effective pressure parameter, \u03b4P, that corrects for the (small) inaccuracies in gas pressure sensors, temperature measurement, and high voltage. In all three cases, minor variations from nominal values produce radially dependent changes in the R(t) function, such that a single, scalable correction function can be used. The calculation of this function is done using the Garfield program [17] configured to model the drift electron transport in MDT tubes with standard operating parameters as in section 2. Specifically, a pure Ar-CO 2 gas mixture without water vapour and zero magnetic field is used. Figure 12 shows the predicted change in the drift time as a function of drift radius for variations of temperature, pressure and high voltage from their reference values. This drift time response was previously validated with temperature data [12]. The maximum effect on the drift time is at the tube wall as expressed in equation (5.1), where the temperature correction is \u22122.6 ns/K, while the pressure correction function scales as \u22120.1 K/mbar relative to the temperature correction. The negative sign means that an increase in gas -10 -  pressure at fixed temperature corresponds to an increase in gas density, a decreased drift electron mean free path, and thus longer drift times. Similarly, a higher voltage at fixed pressure leads to an increased electric field and higher drift velocity. Importantly, for any of these parameters, the curves in figure 12 indicate a negligible effect on drift times for radii smaller than 5 mm. For small deviations of the high voltage from the nominal setting, the drift time changes by only about 0.26 ns/V at the tube wall, thus typical systematic offsets of 1 V have a negligible effect:",

The algorithm was applied to a set of collision runs acquired 2.5 months later with the magnetic field turned on, and with 25 times higher instantaneous luminosity (from 0.17 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in mid August to 4.8 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 at beginning of November), yielding in both cases an average correction \u03b4P of 30.0 \u00b1 0.3 mbar with an 11 mbar RMS spread. Distributions -11 -  of the latter \u03b4P results are shown in figure 15, and the chamber-by-chamber differences in the \u03b4P correction for the two data sets are shown in figure 16. The measured change is within the \u03b4P step size. The corrections are stable in time and insensitive to both the magnetic field and the increased hit rates that result from higher instantaneous luminosity.  The \u03b4P algorithm was further applied to 65 collision runs acquired from May to October 2016, where the peak luminosity exceeded 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , more than twice that of November 2015. These runs used R(t) functions which included the \u03b4P corrections determined in the 2015 data. The chamber-averaged \u03b4P value for each of the runs in 2016 and 2017 is shown in figure 17 as a function of run date. The average of \u03b4P over all of 2016 data is 9.5 \u00b1 0.8 mbar (RMS = 1.3 mbar) and for 2017 is 12.3 \u00b1 1.0 mbar (RMS = 1.3 mbar). The \u03b4P correction is stable over each year to better than 3 mbar. Figure 18 shows the distribution of the chamber-by-chamber \u03b4P difference between the first and last runs in the 2016 data set. The mean difference is 2.3 \u00b1 4.5 (RMS) mbar, within the systematic uncertainty of the algorithm (section 7). This overall result supports the initial hypothesis that \u03b4P represents primarily systematic offsets of pressure gauges and other sensors and, once determined, would remain stable throughout a year of running.

Notably the improvements are measured both by the decrease of the mean value of the distribution and by the decrease of the RMS width, indicating greater uniformity of the resolutions of the whole ensemble of MDT chambers. In 2015, the \u03b4P corrections were applied for the first time in Run 2, and then incorporated into the default calibrations for 2016. In 2016, the larger data set allowed a much higher fraction of the initial t 0 offsets to be determined for single tubes by the calibration centers, resulting in a better overall initial resolution. The \u03b4t 0 corrections from 2016 were propagated into the default calibrations for 2017. For this reason, the incremental improvement in both the mean and the RMS spread decreases with each year and the standard offline tube resolution approaches the fully corrected result.

For this reason, the tracks used in the analysis have a minimum transverse momentum of 20 GeV, yielding an average p T of 40 GeV. The systematic resolution broadening from using a linear fit is determined from a Monte Carlo calculation using a worst-case 0.6 T magnetic field and for the most prevalent MDT geometry: a six-layer chamber with a 17 cm spacer frame separating the two multilayers. The hits are smeared with the nominal 80 \u00b5m resolution, linearly fit to generate residuals, and the resolution computed from equation (43). The average resolution for p T = 40 GeV muons is broadened by about 2 \u00b5m relative to the nominal value. In addition, this uncertainty from track curvature in the magnetic field is also directly investigated by comparing the resolutions obtained with and without the toroidal magnetic field. The average resolution of all chambers with the toroid field off is \u03c3 off = 80.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m. The average broadening of the measured resolution due to the toroidal field is 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m, consistent with the result from Monte Carlo calculation.",
