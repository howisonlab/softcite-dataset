The analysis is based on a data sample collected between 1996 and 2007, amounting to 496 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The Z 0 was measured in the hadronic decay mode. The elasticity of the events was ensured by a cut on \u03b7 max < 3.0, where \u03b7 max is the maximum pseudorapidity of energy deposits in the calorimeter defined with respect to the proton beam direction. A signal was observed at the Z 0 mass. The cross section of the reaction ep \u2192 eZ 0 p ( * ) was measured to be \u03c3 ep \u2192 eZ 0 p ( * ) = 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 (stat.) \u00b1 0.01 (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 0.16 pb. This is the first measurement of Z 0 production in ep collisions.",

Even though the expected numbers of events for W \u00b1 and Z 0 production are low, the measurement of the cross sections of these processes is important as some extensions of the SM predict anomalous couplings and thus changes in these cross sections. A measurement of the cross section for W \u00b1 production at HERA has been performed by H1 and ZEUS [1] in events containing an isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum, giving a cross section \u03c3 (ep \u2192 W \u00b1 X) = 1.06 \u00b1 0.17 (stat. \u2295 syst.) pb, in good agreement with the SM prediction. The cross section for Z 0 production is predicted to be 0.4 pb.",

The hadronic decay mode was chosen 1 because of its large branching ratio and because it allows the excellent resolution of the ZEUS hadronic calorimeter to be exploited to the full. The analysis was restricted to elastic and quasi-elastic Z 0 production in order to suppress QCD multi-jet background. The selected process is ep \u2192 eZ 0 p ( * ) , where p ( * ) stands for a proton (elastic process) or a low-mass nucleon resonance (quasi-elastic process). Figure 1 shows a leading-order (LO) diagram of Z 0 production with subsequent hadronic decay. In such events, there are at least two hadronic jets with high transverse energies, and no hadronic energy deposits around the forward 2 direction, in contrast to what would be expected in inelastic collisions.",
