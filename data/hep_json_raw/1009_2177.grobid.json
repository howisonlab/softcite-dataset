We have collected data with 190 GeV/c charged hadron beams on a liquid hydrogen and nuclear targets in 2008/09. The spectrometer features good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry and a RICH detector further provides \u03c0 / K separation, allowing for studying final states involving neutral particles like \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 as well as hidden strangeness, respectively. We discuss the status of ongoing analyses with specific focus on diffractively produced (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0) \u2212 as well as (KK\u03c0) \u2212 final states.",

            "text": "The existence of states beyond the constituent quark model (CQM) has been speculated about almost since the introduction of colour 1,2 . Due to the gluon self-coupling via colour-charge, so-called hybrid mesons, qq states with an admixture of gluons, and glueballs, states with no quark content, consisting of (constituent) gluons only, are allowed within Quantum Chromodynamics. While light glueballs would not be observable as pure states, as they would mix with ordinary qq-mesons, hybrid mesons (qqg n ) are promising candidates to search for resonances beyond the CQM. Especially, as the lowest mass candidate is predicted 3 to have exotic quantum numbers of spin, parity and charge conjugation J P C = 1 \u2212+ not attainable by ordinary qq states, and a mass between 1.3 and 2.2 GeV/c 2 . Two experimental 1 \u2212+ hybrid candidates in the light-quark sector have been reported in the past in different decay channels, the \u03c0 1 (1400) and the \u03c0 1 (1600). In particular the resonant nature of the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel of the latter is highly disputed 4,5 . COMPASS has started to shed new light on the puzzle by the observation of an exotic 1 \u2212+ signal in the 2004 data, consistent with the famous \u03c0 1 (1600); it shows a clean resonant behaviour 6 .

Photon detection in a wide angular range with high resolution is crucial for decay channels involving \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 or \u03b7 , and the RICH allows for final state particle identification. A good separation of pions from kaons enables the study of kaonic final states. Not only production of strangeness with the pion beam can thus be studied but also kaon diffraction, using the incoming kaon beam. The COMPASS data taken in 2008/09 with a 190 GeV/c \u03c0/K or p beam provide thus excellent opportunity for simultaneous observation of new states in various decay modes within the same experiment. Moreover, the data contain subsets with different beam projectiles and targets, allowing for systematic studies not only of diffractive but also central production and Primakoff reactions.",

The \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel of the \u03c0 1 (1600) for example, can be studied in two modes of 3\u03c0 final states, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (charged) and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (neutral), respectively. Depending on the underlying isobars, the relative contribution should follow isospin conservation. This is shown in Fig. 1. A first, preliminary partialwave analysis (PWA) of main waves in diffractively produced 3\u03c0 events has been performed for both modes, for details see 8 . To compensate different statistics, the wave intensities shown are normalised to the well-known \u03c1\u03c0 decay of the a 2 (1320) to make them comparable. We find similar intensities for the \u03c1\u03c0 decay, whereas a suppression factor of two is observed for the wave decaying into f 2 \u03c0 as expected due to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. Further ongoing analyses involving neutrals cover \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b7 (search for the \u03c0 1 (1400) and lightest 0 ++ glueball candidate) as well as \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b7 and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final states (accessible isobars: ",
