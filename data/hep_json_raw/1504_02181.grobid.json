            "text": "We report on a new constraint on gravitylike short-range forces, in which the interaction charge is mass, obtained by measuring the angular distribution of 5\u00c5 neutrons scattering off atomic xenon gas. Around 10 7 scattering events were collected at the 40 m small angle neutron scattering beam line located at the HANARO research reactor of the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute. The extracted coupling strengths of new forces in the Yukawa-type parametrization are\u011d 2 = (0.2 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b1 2.0)\u00d710 \u221215 GeV \u22122 and\u011d 2 = (\u22125.3\u00b19.0 +2.7   \u22122.8 )\u00d710 \u221217 GeV \u22122 for interaction ranges of 0.1 and 1.0 nm, respectively. These strengths correspond to 95% confidence level limits of g 2 < (1.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u221214 GeV \u22122 and g 2 < (1.3 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u221216 GeV \u22122 , improving the current limits for interaction ranges between 4 and 0.04 nm by a factor of up to 10.",

            "text": "Extensions of the standard model of particle physics have long been discussed. Some of these theories, based on supersymmetry or extra space dimensions, naturally involve gravity or gravitylike interactions even at low energies. Several models predict new bosons mediating gravitylike forces that couple to mass, baryon number, or, in the case of grand unification models, to the difference of baryon and lepton numbers [1][2][3][4][5][6]. This class of models induces modifications to the Newtonian inversesquare law of gravitational interactions, and may also cause violation of the weak equivalence principle. These proposals motivate us to search for new gravitylike forces. Comprehensive reviews of such theories, and the forces they predict, can be found in Refs. [7][8][9].",

Current experimental limits at 95% confidence level (C.L.) for interactions that couple to mass are shown in Fig. 1. Constraints A and B were obtained by microscopic experiments that precisely measured interactions between neutrons and atoms [10,11]. The experimental method used to achieve the results reported in this Letter follows a similar approach. Constraints C to I were obtained by macroscopic tests, searching for non-Newtonian forces between test masses using techniques such as torsion balances and microcantilevers [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This experiment was performed at the 40 m small angle neutron scattering (SANS) beam line located at the HA-NARO research reactor of the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute [19].
