The experiment used a time-structured, low-energy muon beam and a segmented plastic scintillator array to record more than 2 \u00d7 10 12 decays. Two different stopping target configurations were employed in independent data-taking periods. The combined results give \u03c4 \u00b5 + (MuLan) = 2196980.3(2.2) ps, more than 15 times as precise as any previous experiment. The muon lifetime gives the most precise value for the Fermi constant: GF (MuLan) = 1.1663788(7) \u00d7 10 \u22125 GeV \u22122 (0.6 ppm). It is also used to extract the \u00b5 \u2212 p singlet capture rate, which determines the proton's weak induced pseudoscalar coupling g P .",

Strictly speaking, \u03c4 \u00b5 + determines a muon-decay-specific coupling, denoted G \u00b5 , which could be compared to other G F determinations as a test of the standard model [2]. Prior to 1999, the limitation on the precision of G F was dominated by the uncertainty on \u2206q. Van Ritbergen and Stuart were the first to compute the second-order QED radiative corrections in the massless electron limit, reducing the theoretical uncertainty to below 0.3 ppm [3], and well below the then-current experimental uncertainty. This development motivated a new generation of precision muon lifetime measurements, MuLan [4] and FAST [5]. More recently, Pak and Czarnecki extended the result in [3] to finite electron mass, which shifts the predicted decay rate 1/\u03c4 \u00b5 by -0.43 ppm; alternatively, it decreases G F by 0.21 ppm [6].",

During the run, positive muons from at-rest pion decay near the surface of the production target are directed to the experiment through two opposing vertical dipole magnets and a series of 15 magnetic quadrupole lenses. A velocity-selecting E \u00d7 B separator is tuned to pass muons and reject positrons. A special feature of the beamline is a custom, 60-ns switching, 25-kV kicker [8]. When energized, the electric field across the 120-mm vertical gap and 1500-mm length displaces the muon beam by 46 mm at the exit and deflects it by 45 mrad onto a downstream collimator. The muon flux of \u223c 10 7 \u00b5/s at the experimental focus is reduced by an extinction factor \u01eb \u223c 10 3 . The kicker is switched by an external timing circuit that synchronizes the data collection cycles into 5 \u00b5s kicker-off accumulation periods, T A , followed by 22 \u00b5s kicker-on measurement periods, T M , also called \"fills.\" The kicker voltage stability during the measuring period, V (t), coupled with the derivative d\u01eb/dV (t) at full voltage, determines the time stability of background from this source.",

Any change in the ensemble-averaged residual polarization \u2212 \u2192 P \u00b5 during the measuring period can result in an effective time-dependent acceptance if the individual detectors are not symmetric around the stopping target and identical in response. For many materials, the magnitude of \u2212 \u2192 P \u00b5 is reduced during the muon stopping process. It can also be reduced by the application of a magnetic field transverse to the spin direction and having a field strength sufficient to precess the spin rapidly compared to T A . In practice, a residual longitudinal polarization \u2212 \u2192 P L remains, owing to misalignment of the transverse field. The array of detectors is highly and symmetrically segmented. The sum of events recorded by a detector at angle (\u03b8, \u03c6) with those from an equally efficient detector at (180 \u2022 \u2212 \u03b8, 180 \u2022 + \u03c6) form a decay histogram that is immune to changes in \u2212 \u2192 P \u00b5 . Several changes compared to the setup used in Ref. [4] involve the muon delivery and the stopping target. A 200-mm-diameter vacuum beampipe now extends the beamline through the detector array (see Fig. 1) ending in a thin mylar window. Muons are stopped in a 21-mm horizontal by 10-mm vertical (RMS) spot centered on the target disk. The R06 target is a 0.5-mm-thick, 200-mm-diameter ferromagnetic AK-3 foil [9], having an internal in-plane bulk magnetic field of approximately 0.4 T. The R07 target is a 2-mm-thick, 130-mm-diameter crystalline quartz (SiO 2 ) disk, in which stopped muons form muonium 90% of the time [10]. A Halbach arrangement of permanent magnets provides a nearly uniform 0.013 T field in the plane of the quartz disk. The internal AK-3 magnetization or the external magnet field normally points left or right in the horizontal direction and the muon spin precesses in the vertical plane with periods of 18 ns and 2.6 ns, respectively, for free muons in AK-3 or muonium in quartz. The 10% of muons in diamagnetic states in quartz precess with a period of 550 ns, which is observed. Both targets can swing open to allow the beam to pass unobstructed to a proportional wire chamber, which monitors the rate and transverse profile at the downstream end of the experiment.",

The digitization is extended if the threshold is exceeded at the 24th sample. For the average pulse, the full width at 20% maximum is 9 ns.",

The waveforms are fit to pulse-shape templates, prepared from a set of low-rate events; the time of a decay is defined as the peak of the pulse shape. In more than 99.9% of the cases, a single pulse exists on a waveform and it can be identified reliably. A distribution of pulse energies is made for each detector and a run-by-run dependent pulse threshold is established at the minimum in the distribution between the low-amplitude PMT noise and the MIP peak (45\u221255% of the MIP peak amplitude). Rare multiple-pulse waveforms are more difficult to characterize, requiring an iterative approach that adds additional pulses as needed and/or introduces more sophisticated fitting methods. When two pulses are separated by more than 3 c.t., the procedure works well. For shorter separation times, only one hit is reconstructed and its time is set to the energy-weighted average of the ADC samples. For resolved pulses, an \"artificial deadtime\" (ADT) can still be applied on a per-detector basis, eliminating pulses when a minimum time separates sequential hits in the same scintillator. The ADT used in the analysis varies from 5 to 68 c.t. and represents an important diagnostic of the pileup correction procedure.",

Under our running conditions, uncorrected pileup would shift the fitted lifetime from its true value by \u03b4\u03c4 \u00b5 /ADT = 24 ppm/c.t. Pileup is corrected using a statistical procedure based on the data itself. When a hit is observed at time t i , in fill j, an interval between t i and t i + ADT is searched in fill j + 1. If a hit is observed in this interval, its time is recorded in a separate histogram, which is then added back into the original decay histogram. The process is repeated for higher-order pileup, and it includes fine adjustments to account for time jitter between inner-outer coincidences, and for uncorrelated single hits and other distortions. A Monte-Carlo study verified the pileup correction procedure with input hits occurring at actual coincidence, singles, and background rates, and with the measured time jitter in inner-outer hits. It was also tested at much higher rates where the correction is correspondingly larger. Pileup-related lifetime shifts are reduced to \u03b4\u03c4 \u00b5 /ADT = +0.018 ppm/c.t. A linear extrapolation to zero ADT gives our quoted value. The overall pileup systematic uncertainty is estimated to be less than 0.2 ppm. An alternative approach is to pileup correction is to add an explicit 1st-order pileup term, exp(\u22122t/\u03c4 \u00b5 ), to the fit function in Eq. 2. This yields the same lifetime as our correction procedure, but at the price of doubling the uncertainty on \u03c4 \u00b5 , owing to the correlation of the additional term in the fit. Because the residual polarization in the AK-3 target is small enough that it is not distinguishable in individual time spectra, Eq. 2 describes the R06 data well. A fit to the pileup-corrected event histogram, summed over all detector pairs, gives a \u03c7 2 /dof = 1.03 \u00b1 0.04 for a fit start time 220 ns into the measurement period and an ADT of 6 c.t. Although no \u03c6 dependence is observed for individual fits, a 12 ppm slope exists in the distribution of lifetime versus cos(\u03b8), which is canceled to better than 0.10 ppm by the symmetry of the detector array and the accuracy of the alignment. The slope is consistent with the relaxation of a spin component along the beam axis. The lifetimes of the 85 opposite detector pairs, which are first summed, then fit, is flat, when plotted from \u03b8 = 0 to 90 degrees, and the distribution of results is Gaussian having a normalized width \u03c3/mean = 0.90 \u00b1 0.08, which is in acceptable agreement with 1.0.",

The amplitude of the precession signal for individual detectors can be as large as 0.1% and the longitudinal polarization can be as large as 0.15%. A different analysis procedure, which is insensitive to small and unknown efficiency differences, is used. Each detector-pair histogram is first fit using Eq. 2 with A multiplied by [1 + P 2 \u2022 exp (\u2212t/\u03c4 2 ) sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6)]; here P 2 and \u03c4 2 are the transverse polarization and relaxation time constant, respectively. These fits result in 170 \"effective\" muon disappearance rates, which differ from the true muon decay rate because of the relaxation of the longitudinal spin component. Next, the 170 effective lifetimes are fit to extract the true muon lifetime using a function that accounts for the position of detectors relative to the longitudinal polarization direction. This fit takes advantage of the smooth geometrical-based evolution of the relaxation effect. The leading systematic uncertainty of 0.20 ppm for this procedure is due to the uncertainty of the beam position on the target. The lifetime obtained is in agreement (to 0.3 ppm) with the result from a fit to the simple sum of detector-pair histograms using Eq. 2.",

The effect, which is reproducible in bench tests, disappears in \u223c 4 \u00b5s. An empirical function is used to characterize and correct for the oscillation prior to the final fits. (ii) A short-time-scale gain shift occurs when one hit closely follows a preceding hit. The second hit is affected by the remnant long-decay-time scintillator light from the first pulse and by the intrinsic recovery time of the PMT and voltage divider. A \u223c 1% increase in detector gain exists following a pulse, which persists for 50 or 500 ns in PH-or ET-instrumented detectors, respectively. (iii) A long-time-scale change also exists that differs by PMT type. The PH-tube gains increase by 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and the ET-tube gains decrease by 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , over the 22 \u00b5s measurement period.

The procedure was tested by accumulating a high-threshold spectrum, which amplifies the time spectrum distortion by roughly a factor of 60.
