            "text": "The NA62 experiment is located at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. Its main goal is to measure the branching ratio (BR) of the ultra rare decay 1 K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd, with the precision of \u223c 10 %. The Standard Model (SM) prediction is very accurate, taking in account next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the top quark contributions, NNLO QCD corrections to the charm contributions, NLO electroweak corrections to both top and charm contributions and extensive calculations of isospin breaking and non-perturbative effects. The best prediction of the branching ratio 2 is BR(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) = (7.81 +0.8 \u22120.71 \u00b10.29)\u00d710 \u221211 while the experimental measurement, combining data from E787 and E949 experiments 3 at Brookhaven AGS is (17.3 +11.5 \u221210.5 ) \u00d7 10 \u221211 . During 2014 the NA62 detector was deployed and commissioned, enabling to accumulate a valuable sample of kaon decays to verify the expected physics sensitivity.",

The experimental principle is the decay-in-flight technique, and the variable used to distinguish the signal from the background is the squared missing mass m 2 miss = (P K + \u2212 P \u03c0 + ) 2 where P are the four momenta of the incoming kaon and outgoing pion. Cuts on the missing mass value allow the rejection of more than 90% of the backgrounds. Figure 1 shows the m 2 miss distribution assuming that the charged particle is a pion with momentum lower than 35 GeV. One defines two regions where the signal is not dominated by background, Region I above the K \u00b52 but below the K \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 contribution and Region II above the K \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and below the K 3\u03c0 contributions.

The time resolution per track should be of the order of 200 ps, while the momentum resolution \u03c3(P )/P should be \u223c0.2%. During the commissioning run, the three stations have been installed, but only partially read out (10% of the chips). The time resolution measurement is in progress. The Straw Tracker detector 6 (STRAW) measures the direction and momentum of charged particles from the kaon decay. It is composed of 4 chambers with x,y,u,v views, located in vacuum, before and after a dipole magnet which produces the vertical B-field of 0.36 T. The detector was fully operational. Both spectrometers were read out triggerless and the matching with the other detectors was performed offline.",

It covers photon angle from 1.5 to 8.5 mrad and should guarantee an inefficiency lower than 10 \u22125 for photons with energy > 35 GeV.
