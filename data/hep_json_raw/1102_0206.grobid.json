In Ref.

            "text": "We use a data sample of approximately 33 pb \u22121 collected with the LHCb detector in 2010 [7]. The detector elements are placed along the beam line of the LHC starting with the Vertex Locator (VELO), a silicon strip device that surrounds the proton-proton interaction region and is positioned 8 mm from the beam during collisions. It provides precise locations for primary pp interaction vertices, the locations of decays of long-lived particles, and contributes to the measurement of track momenta. Other devices used to measure track momenta comprise a large area silicon strip detector (TT) located in front of a 3.7 Tm dipole magnet, and a combination of silicon strip detectors (IT) and straw drift chambers (OT) placed behind. Two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors are used to identify charged hadrons. Further downstream an Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is used for photon detection and electron identification, followed by a Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL), and a system consisting of alternating layers of iron and chambers (MWPC and triple-GEM) that distinguishes muons from hadrons (MUON). The ECAL, MUON, and HCAL provide the capability of first-level hardware triggering. This analysis is restricted to events accepted by a J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 trigger. Subsequent analysis selection criteria are applied that serve to reject background, yet preserve high efficiencies on both the J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J /\u03c8 K + K \u2212 final states, as determined by Monte Carlo events generated using PYTHIA [8], and LHCb detector simulation based on GEANT4 [9]. Tracks are reconstructed as described in Ref. [7]. To be considered as a J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidate opposite sign tracks are required to have transverse momentum, p T , greater than 500 MeV, be identified as muons, and form a common vertex with fit \u03c7 2 per number of degrees of freedom (ndof) less than 11. The \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2 with an additional requirement, used only for this plot, that the pseudo proper-time, t z , be greater than 0.5 ps, where t z is the distance that the J /\u03c8 candidate travels downstream parallel to the beam, along z, times the known J /\u03c8 mass divided by the z component of the candidate's momentum. The data are fit with a Crystal Ball signal function [10] to account for the radiative tail towards low mass, and a linear background function. There are 549,000 \u00b1 1100 J /\u03c8 signal events in the entire mass range. For subsequent use only candidates within \u00b148 MeV of the known J /\u03c8 mass are selected.",

The data show a strong peak near 980 MeV and an excess of events above the like-sign background extending up to 1500 MeV. Our mass spectrum is similar in shape to those seen previously in studies of the S-wave \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system with ss quarks in the initial state [13][14][15]. To establish a value for R f 0 /\u03c6 requires fitting the shape of the f 0 resonance. Simulation shows that our acceptance is independent of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass, and we choose an interval between 580 and 1480 MeV. Guidance is given by the BES Collaboration who fit the spectrum in J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [14]. We include here the f 0 (980) and f 0 (1370) resonances, though other final states may be present, for example the f 2 (1270) a 2 ++ state [13,14]; it will take much larger statistics to sort out the higher mass states. We use a coupled-channel Breit-Wigner amplitude (Flatt\u00e9) for the f 0 (980) resonance [16] and a Breit-Wigner shape (BW) for the higher mass f 0 (1370). Defining m as the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass, the mass distribution is fit with a function involving the square of the interfering amplitudes A(m)",

The events around the f 0 (980) mass are large enough in rate and have small enough backgrounds that they could be used to measure \u03b2 s without angular analysis. It may also be possible to use other data in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass region above the f 0 (980) for this purpose if they turn out to be dominated by S-wave.",

To select B 0 s candidates we further require that the two pions or kaons form a vertex with a \u03c7 2 < 10, that they form a candidate B 0 s vertex with the J /\u03c8 where the vertex fit \u03c7 2 /ndof < 5, and that this B 0 s candidate points to the primary vertex at an angle not different from its momentum direction by more than 0.68 \u2022 . Simulations are used to evaluate our detection efficiencies. For the J /\u03c8\u03c6 final state we use the measured decay parameters from CDF [3]. The J /\u03c8 f 0 final state is simulated using full longitudinal polarization of the J /\u03c8 meson. The efficiencies of having all four decay tracks in the geometric acceptance and satisfying the trigger, track reconstruction and data selection requirements are (1.471 \u00b1 0.024)% for J /\u03c8 f 0 , requiring the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass be within \u00b1500 MeV of 980 MeV, and (1.454 \u00b1 0.021)% for J /\u03c8\u03c6, having the K + K \u2212 invariant mass be within \u00b120 MeV of the \u03c6 mass.
