The events are produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC, and the data sample, recorded in 2016, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Jet multiplicity and flavor are used to enhance signal sensitivity, and dedicated control regions are used to constrain the dominant backgrounds. The observed and expected signal significances are, respectively, 1.6 and 1.0 standard deviations, and the tttt cross section is measured to be 16.9 +13.8   \u221211.4 fb, in agreement with next-to-leading-order standard model predictions. These results are also used to constrain the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson to be less than 2.1 times its expected standard model value at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "In the standard model (SM) the production of four top quarks (tttt) is a rare process, with representative leading-order (LO) Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 1. Many beyond-the-SM (BSM) theories predict an enhancement of the tttt cross section, \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tttt), such as gluino pair production in the supersymmetry framework [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10], the pair production of scalar gluons [11,12], and the production of a heavy pseudoscalar or scalar boson in association with a tt pair in Type II two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [13][14][15]. In addition, a top quark Yukawa coupling larger than expected in the SM can lead to a significant increase in tttt production via an off-shell SM Higgs boson [16]. The SM prediction for \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tttt) at \u221a s = 13 TeV is 9.2 +2.9 \u22122.4 fb at next-to-leading order (NLO) [17]. An alternative prediction of 12.2 +5.0 \u22124.4 fb is reported in Ref. [16], obtained from a LO calculation of e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch 9.6 +3.9 \u22123.5 fb and an NLO/LO K -factor of 1.27 based on the 14 TeV calculation of Ref. [18].",

Among these final states, the same-sign dilepton and the three-(or more) lepton final states, considering = e, \u03bc, correspond to branching fractions in tttt events of 8 and 1%, respectively, excluding the small contribution from W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, which is included in selected events. However, due to the low level of backgrounds, these channels are the most sensitive to tttt production in the regime with SM-like kinematic properties. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC have previously searched for SM tttt production in \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV pp collisions [20][21][22][23][24]. The most sensitive of these results is a re-interpretation of the CMS same-sign dilepton search for BSM physics at 13 TeV [23], with an observed (expected) tttt cross section upper limit (assuming no SM tttt signal) of 42 (27 +13 \u22128 ) fb at the 95% confidence level (CL).",

The reweighting is based on a comparison of the light-flavor jet multiplicity in dilepton tt events in data and simulation. The method requires exactly two jets identified as originating from b quarks in dilepton tt events, and assumes that all other jets are from ISR. Weighting factors are obtained as a function of N ISR jets to bring data and MC into agreement. These weights are then applied, keeping the total cross section constant, to ttW and ttZ/\u03b3 * MC as a function of the number of jets not originating from top quark, W, or Z decays. To improve the modeling of the flavor of additional jets, the simulation is also corrected to account for the measured ratio of ttbb/ttjj cross sections reported in Ref. [33].

Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are improved with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3 +jet and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [41,42]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. Jets originating from b quarks are identified as b-tagged jets using a deep neural network algorithm [43], with a working point chosen such that the efficiency to identify a b jet is 55-70% for a jet transverse momentum ( p T ) between 20 and 400 GeV. The misidentification rate for a light-flavor jet is 1-2% in the same jet p T range. The vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates in an event [44].

In signal regions requiring four b-tagged jets, where the effect is dominant, this results in a systematic uncertainty of up to 15% on the total background prediction.

            "text": "The results of a search for standard model (SM) production of tttt at the LHC have been presented, using data from \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector in 2016. The analysis strategy uses same-sign dilepton as well as three-(or more) lepton events, relying on jet multiplicity and jet flavor to define search regions that are used to probe the tttt process. Combining these regions yields a significance of 1.6 standard deviations relative to the background-only hypothesis, and a measured value for the tttt cross section of 16.9 +13.8 \u221211.4 fb, in agreement with the standard model predictions. The results are also re-interpreted to constrain the ratio of the top quark Yukawa coupling to its SM value, yielding |y t /y SM t | < 2.1 at 95% confidence level. Yandong Liu for providing calculations used in determining a constraint on the top quark Yukawa coupling. We congratulate our colleagues in the CERN accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the computing centers and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Com-puting Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses. Finally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: BMWFW and FWF (Austria); FNRS and FWO (Belgium); CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, and FAPESP (Brazil); MES (Bulgaria); CERN; CAS, MoST, and NSFC (China); COLCIENCIAS (Colombia); MSES and CSF (Croatia); RPF (Cyprus); SENESCYT (Ecuador); MoER, ERC IUT, and ERDF (Estonia); Academy of Finland, MEC, and HIP (Finland); CEA and CNRS/IN2P3 (France); BMBF, DFG, and HGF (Germany); GSRT (Greece); OTKA and NIH (Hungary); DAE and DST (India); Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecomm ons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
