This measurement aims to set the first limit on single-photon neutrino production below 1 GeV. Neutrino production of single photon is a subdominant process in neutrino interactions. Because photons and electrons have very similar signatures in neutrino detectors, careful estimations need to be made not to bias the \u03bd e appearance oscillation results of accelerator neutrino experiments. The single photons are created by a nuclear resonance (typically \u2206(1232)) after interaction of the neutrino. The cross section is expected to be of the order of 10 \u221242 cm 2 . The main background is composed of \u03c0 0 decaying into two photons, where only one photon is detected, and \u03c0 0 events creating photons from outside of the fiducial volume.",

The object of this analysis is to search for processes where a single photon and no lepton / meson is emitted after neutrino NC interaction (except the neutrino), later referred to as \"NC gamma\".
