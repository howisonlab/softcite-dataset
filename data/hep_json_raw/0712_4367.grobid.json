From the weighted average of the experimental measurements of d(p) yields at 40(20), 30(15), 20 (10) and 15 7GeV/c in the forward direction, \u03ba can be determined as: (0.79 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.13) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , where the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in the acceptance calculation. The dependence of the coalescence factor \u03ba as a function of the momentum of the produced deuteron p d is shown in figure 3. It is interesting to compare this determination with the theoretically expected value (4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22122 GeV 2 ) from [8] (where \u03ba has no momentum dependence) and the expectations of reference [1] (where a p \u22122 d dependence is expected). Our results are in qualitative agreement with what found in reference [9] at lower energies (\u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 GeV 2 ). According to reference [10] deuterons are mainly directly produced in p + Be collisions, while in P b + P b collisions the dominant production mechanism for deuterons is coalescence. A possible explanation may be the smaller baryon density and the smaller source volume available in p + Be collisions compared to P b + P b collisions.",
