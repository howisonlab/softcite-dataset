Such a particle A can be produced in electron-nucleus fixed-target scattering and then decay to an e + e \u2212 pair, producing a narrow resonance in the QED trident spectrum. Using APEX test run data, we searched in the mass range 175-250 MeV, found no evidence for an A \u2192 e + e \u2212 reaction, and set an upper limit of \u03b1 /\u03b1 10 \u22126 . Our findings demonstrate that fixed-target searches can explore a new, wide, and important range of masses and couplings for sub-GeV forces.",

New forces could have escaped detection only if their mediators are either heavier than O(TeV) or quite weakly coupled. The latter possibility can be tested by precision colliding-beam and fixed-target experiments. This letter presents the results of a search for sub-GeV mediators of weakly coupled new forces in a test run for the A Experiment (APEX), which was proposed in [1] based on the general concepts presented in [2].",

Due to the excellent HRS relative momentum resolution of O(10 \u22124 ), the mass resolution is dominated by three contributions to the angular resolution: scattering of the e + e \u2212 inside the target, track measurement errors by the HRS detectors, and imperfections in the magnetic optics reconstruction matrix. Multiple scattering in the target contributes 0.37 mrad to the vertical and horizontal angular resolutions for each particle. Track measurement uncertainties contribute typically 0.33 (1.85) mrad to the horizontal (vertical) angular resolution in the left HRS and 0.43 (1.77) in the right HRS. Magnetic optics imperfections in both HRSs were found to contribute typically 0.10 (0.22) mrad to the horizontal (vertical) angular resolution. Because calibration of the magnetic optics was performed using only e \u2212 , and not e + , there is a possibility of additional aberrations in the positron arm. An upper limit for possible aberrations of 0.5 mrad was obtained from angular correlations in H(e, e p) experiments with the HRS and the calculations of the septum magnetic field. Accounting for these effects, we determine the combined mass resolution (rms) to be between 0.85 and 1.11 MeV, depending on the The invariant mass spectrum of e + e \u2212 pair events in the final event sample (black points, with error bars), accidental e + e \u2212 coincidence events (blue short-dash line), and the QED calculation of the trident background added to the accidental event sample (red long-dash line).
