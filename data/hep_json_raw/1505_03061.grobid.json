Though the \u03c6 and \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 states have long been established experimentally, only a handful of strangeonia are well known, in contrast to the rich cc charmoium system. An overview of the ss states and their experimental status is presented in this paper. The BESIII experiment has collected the world's largest samples of J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S), \u03c8(3770), and direct e + e \u2212 annihilations at energies below the J/\u03c8 and above 3.8 GeV, and will continue to accumulate high quality, large integrated luminosity in the \u03c4 -charm energy region. These data, combined with the excellent performance of the BE-SIII detector, will offer unprecedent opportunities to explore the ss system. In this paper we describe the experimental techniques to explore strangeonia with the BESIII detector.",

Since then the quark model has offered a useful tool in understanding the substructures of hadrons and led to the advent of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for describing the strong interaction. With the development of accelerators and detectors, hundreds of hadrons have been discovered and the quark model provides a good description of the observed hadrons, in particular the ground states and the heavy quarkonium states. Taking charmonium spectroscopy, bound states of the charmed quark and antiquark (cc), as an example, it reflects a beautiful regularity and numerous electromagnetic and strong transitions. But there are still many unseen states predicted by the quark model, in particular the ss states, for which the experimental situation is not well understood.",

In addition, the strangeonium spectrum also helps identify the exotics (e.g., glueball, hybrid, multi-quark states) which can decay into the same final states. Within the framework of the relativistic quark model with QCD [1], a spectroscopy similar to heavy quarkonia is expected for strangeonium (ss) states. Their decays were studied in detail with the 3 P 0 model [2], which is a phenomelogical theory for describing light meson decays. The ss spectroscopy with spin J < 4 predicted by the 3 P 0 model is shown in Fig. 1. Only seven states (underlined with the solid lines) have been established and many members of the spectrum are still missing.",

Since then the \u03b7 \u2032 , being a pure SU(3) singlet, has attracted both theoretical and experimental attention due to its special role in understanding low energy QCD. Because of the chiral anomaly, the \u03b7 \u2032 is a non-Goldstone boson which distinguishes itself from the others in the ground pseudoscalar nonet. Therefore the \u03b7 \u2032 provides a unique field to test the fundamental symmetries and the predictions for chiral perturbative theory. In addition, the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing issue remains. Of interest is the gluonic content in \u03b7 \u2032 , which makes this case more complicated.

The \u03c6 meson was first seen in a bubble chamber experiment at Brookhaven in 1962, was subsequently determined to be a vector meson with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , and could be accommodated as an SU(3) singlet, supplementing an octet of other vector mesons (e.g., \u03c1, K * and \u03c9). To explain that \u03c6 prefers to decay into two kaons but not \u03c1\u03c0, the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule [7] was introduced. The \u03c6 contains a ss pair; when it decays, the strange quarks have to go somewhere, and the kaon pair route is the only possibility. Since it has a quite narrow width and could be directly produced in e + e \u2212 collisions, a \u03c6 factory, named DA\u03a6NE, was built to study its properties using the abundant production of \u03c6 collected with the KLOE detector, which had made a significant contribution to kaon and hadronic physics in the low QCD energy region. An upgrade of DA\u03a6NE and the KLOE detector were performed. The luminosity was designed to be improved by a factor of 3 and the detector was also upgraded accordingly. A review of the physics with the KLOE-2 detector at DA\u03a6NE is given in Ref. [8].",

However, the absence of the f 1 (1510) in hadronic and radiative J/\u03c8 decays makes this case complicated. Given the complexity in the KK\u03c0 0 system, it is important to extract these states in J/\u03c8 decays using high statistics data which will enable PWA. In addition to K * K, the observation of new decay modes, e.g., \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 and 4\u03c0, could also pro-vide valuable information on the f 1 (1420). Recently, BESIII reported evidence for f 1 (1510) observed in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 decays [21].",

Since then this state has been observed in many different production processes, including K \u2212 p collisions, e + e \u2212 annihilations, pp annihilations, and ep collisions. Given that it decays dominantly into a KK instead of a \u03c0\u03c0 and is only observed in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6KK decays, it seems to be a ss meson. A new idea that the f \u2032 2 (1525) is dynamically generated from the vector-vector interaction has been introduced in Ref. [23]. Support for this idea can be found in Ref.

Recently a preliminary result on the observation of \u03c6(1680) was reported by CMD-3. The alternative strategy is to use B-factory data, after radiation of a hard initial state photon, to investigate the light hadron spectroscopy; many nice results from Belle and Babar have been summarized in Ref.

The BESIII detector at the BEPCII, running at the energy range of 2\u22124.6 GeV, may provide an important contribution to this field. The BESIII detector is a large solidangle magnetic spectrometer with high acceptance, full primary vertex reconstruction and secondary vertex reconstruction for long lived particle such as K 0 S and \u039b, high particle identification efficiency, good momentum resolution of charged particles and excellent energy resolution of electrons and photons. In addition, the designed peak luminosity of BEPCII, 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 3.773 GeV, is about 100 times better than its predecessor, which allows us to accumulate the very large data samples in a short period of time. About 1.3 billion J/\u03c8 events [42] and 0.5 billion \u03c8(2S) events have been collected by the BESIII detector, which will provide a great opportunity to perform experimental studies of strangeonium produced in J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays.",
