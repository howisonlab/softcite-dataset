Of particular interest, the longitudinal helicity fraction of pair-produced vector bosons is also measured.",

            "text": "The study of W \u00b1 Z diboson production is an important test of the Standard Model (SM) for its sensitivity to gauge boson self-interactions, related to the non-Abelian structure of the electroweak interaction. It provides the means to directly probe the triple gauge boson couplings (TGC), in particular the W W Z gauge coupling. Improved constraints from precise measurements can potentially probe scales of new physics in the multi-TeV range and provide a way to look for signals of new physics in a model-independent way. Previous measurements have concentrated on the inclusive and differential production cross sections. In addition to more precise e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch measurements of these cross sections that include new data, this paper presents measurements of the three helicity fractions of the W and Z bosons. The existence of the third state, the longitudinally polarised state, is a consequence of the non-vanishing mass of the bosons generated by the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The measurement of the polarisation in diboson production therefore tests both the SM innermost gauge symmetry structure, through the existence of the triple gauge coupling, and the particular way this symmetry is spontaneously broken, via the longitudinal helicity state. Angular observables can be used to look for new interactions that can lead to different polarisation behaviour than predicted by the SM, to which the W \u00b1 Z final state would be particularly sensitive [1,2]. Precise calculations, at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD, of SM polarisation observables in W \u00b1 Z production as well as electroweak corrections have recently appeared [3]. Polarisation measurements for each charge of the W boson might be helpful in the investigation of C P violation effects in the interaction between gauge bosons [4,5]. In the longer term, measuring the scattering of longitudinally polarised vector bosons will be a fundamental test of electroweak symmetry breaking [6].",

A set of tracking detectors around the collision point (collectively referred to as the inner detector) is located within a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, and is surrounded by a calorimeter system and a muon spectrometer. The inner detector (ID) consists of a silicon pixel detector and a silicon microstrip tracker, together providing precision tracking in the pseu-dorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, complemented by a straw-tube transition radiation tracker providing tracking and electron identification information for |\u03b7| < 2.0. The electromagnetic calorimeter covers the region |\u03b7| < 3.2 and is based on a lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling technology. The hadronic calorimeter uses a steel/scintillator-tile sampling detector in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 and a copper/LAr detector in the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The most forward region of ATLAS, 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, is equipped with a forward calorimeter, measuring electromagnetic and hadronic energies in copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr modules. The muon spectrometer (MS) comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers to measure the deflection of muons in a magnetic field generated by three large superconducting toroids with coils arranged with an eightfold azimuthal symmetry around the calorimeters. The high-precision chambers cover the range of |\u03b7| < 2.7 with three layers of monitored drift tubes, complemented by cathode strip chambers in the forward region, where the particle flux is highest. The muon trigger system covers the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 with resistive-plate chambers in the barrel and thin-gap chambers in the endcap regions. A two-level trigger system [35] is used to select events in real time. It consists of a hardware-based first-level trigger that uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to approximately 100 kHz, and a software-based high-level trigger system that reduces the event rate to about 1 kHz. The latter employs algorithms similar to those used offline to identify electrons, muons, photons and jets.",

The production of W \u00b1 Z pairs and the subsequent leptonic decays of the vector bosons were simulated at NLO in QCD using the Powheg-Box v2 [39][40][41][42] generator, interfaced to Pythia 8.210 [43] for simulation of parton showering, hadronisation and the underlying event. Final-state radiation resulting from QED interactions is simulated using Pythia 8.210 and the AZNLO [44] set of tuned parameters. The CT10 [45] PDF set was used for the hard-scattering process, while the CTEQ6L1 [46] PDF set was used for the parton shower. The sample was generated with dynamic renormalisation and factorisation QCD scales, \u03bc R and \u03bc F , equal to m W Z /2, where m W Z is the invariant mass of the W Z system. An additional W \u00b1 Z sample was generated by interfacing Powheg-Box v2 matrix elements to the Herwig++ 2.7.1 [47] fragmentation model and is used to estimate the uncertainty due to the fragmentation modelling. Also for this sample, the CT10 and CTEQ6L1 PDF sets are used for the matrix elements and the parton showers, respectively, while QED final-state radiation is internally modelled in Herwig. An alternative signal sample was generated at NLO QCD using the Sherpa 2.2.2 generator [48]. Matrix elements contain all diagrams with four electroweak vertices. They were calculated for up to one parton at NLO and up to three partons at LO using Comix [49] and OpenLoops [50], and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [51] according to the ME+PS@NLO prescription [52]. The NNPDF3.0nnlo [53] PDF set was used in conjunction with the dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. A calculation using Sherpa 2.1 with one to three partons at LO is also used for comparisons to measured jet observables. Finally, the NLO QCD predictions from the MC@NLO v4.0 [54] MC generator interfaced to the Herwig fragmentation model, using the CT10 PDF set, are also used to estimate signal modelling uncertainties.",

Due to the higher instantaneous luminosity in 2016 the trigger threshold was increased to 26 GeV for both the electrons and muons. Furthermore, tighter lepton isolation and tighter electron identification requirements were applied in 2016. Possible inefficiencies for leptons with large transverse momentum are reduced by using additional triggers with tighter thresholds, p T = 60 GeV and 50 GeV for electrons and muons respectively, and no isolation requirements. Finally, a single-electron trigger requiring p T > 120 GeV (in 2015) and p T > 140 GeV (in 2016) with less restrictive electron identification criteria was used to increase the selection efficiency for highp T electrons. The combined efficiency of these triggers is close to 100% for W \u00b1 Z events passing the offline selection criteria.",

Finally, muons associated to the W boson must also pass a tighter isolation requirement, tuned for an efficiency of at least 90% (99%) for p T > 25 (60) GeV.",

This reducible background is esti-mated with a data-driven method based on the inversion of a matrix containing the efficiencies and the misidentification probabilities for prompt and fake leptons [9,79]. The method exploits the classification of the leptons as loose or tight candidates and the probability that a fake lepton is misidentified as a loose or tight lepton. Tight leptons are signal leptons as defined in Sect. 5. Loose leptons are leptons that do not meet the isolation and identification criteria of signal leptons but satisfy only looser criteria. The misidentification probabilities for fake leptons are determined from data using dedicated control samples enriched in misidentified leptons from light-or heavy-flavour jets and from photon conversions. The lepton efficiencies and misidentification probabilities are combined with event rates in data samples of W \u00b1 Z candidate events where at least one and up to three of the leptons are loose. Then, solving the system of linear equations, the number of events with at least one misidentified lepton, which represents the amount of reducible background in the W \u00b1 Z sample, is obtained. About 2% of this background contribution arises from events with two fake leptons. The background from events with three fake leptons, e.g., from multijet processes, is negligible. The method allows the shape of any kinematic distribution of reducible background events to be estimated. Another independent method to assess the reducible background was also considered. This method estimates the amount of reducible background using MC simulations scaled to data by process-dependent factors determined from the data-to-MC comparison in dedicated control regions. Good agreement with the matrix method estimate is obtained at the level of 4% in the yield and 40% in the shape of the distributions of irreducible background events.",

The effects of QCD scale uncertainties are estimated by varying \u03bc R and \u03bc F by factors of two around the nominal scale m W Z /2 with the constraint 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc R /\u03bc F \u2264 2, where m W Z is the invariant mass of the W Z system. Uncertainties arising from the choice of parton shower model are estimated by interfacing Powheg with Pythia or Herwig and comparing the results. Among these three sources of theoretical uncertainty, only the choice of parton shower model has an effect on the C W Z factors, of 0.5%. The uncertainty of the acceptance factor A W Z is less than 0.5% due to the PDF choice, less than 0.7% due to the QCD scale choice, and about 0.5% for the choice of parton shower model. Uncertainties in the unfolding from detector to particle level due to imperfect description of the data by the MC simulation are evaluated using a data-driven method [87]. The MC differential distribution is corrected to match the data distribution and the resulting weighted MC distribution at detector level is unfolded with the response matrix used in the actual data unfolding. The new unfolded distribution is compared with the weighted MC distribution at particle level and the difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties in the unfolding are typically of the order of 2% but can vary from 0.1% to 10% depending on the considered observable and bin. For the inclusive measurements, differences in the unfolded results if the Powheg+Pythia or Sherpa 2.2.2 MC signal samples are used for the unfolding are found to be covered by these unfolding uncertainties.",

The systematic uncertainties on the measured cross sections are determined by repeating the analysis after applying appropriate variations for each source of systematic uncertainty to the simulated samples. The uncertainties on the jet energy scale and resolution are based on their respective measurements in data [73]. The uncertainty on E miss T is estimated by propagating the uncertainties on the transverse momenta of reconstructed objects and by applying momentum scale and resolution uncertainties to the track-based soft term [77]. A variation in the pileup reweighting of the MC is included to cover the uncertainty on the ratio between the predicted and measured inelastic crosssection in the fiducial volume defined by M X > 13 GeV where M X is the mass of the hadronic system [88].

The large angular coverage of the ATLAS detector enables measurement of the missing transverse momentum, which can be identified as the transverse momentum of the neutrino. The neutrino longitudinal momentum p \u03bd z is obtained using the W mass constraint. Solving the corresponding equation leads to a twofold ambiguity, which is resolved by choosing the solution with the smaller | p \u03bd z |. If the measured transverse mass is larger than the nominal W mass, no real solutions exist for p \u03bd z . The most likely cause is that the measured E miss T is larger than the actual neutrino p T . In this case, the best estimate is obtained by choosing the real part of the complex solutions.

The equation f 0 + f R + f L = 1 is used to constrain the independent parameters of the fit to f 0 , f L \u2212 f R and the integrated fiducial cross section. The templates of q \u2022 cos \u03b8 ,W and cos \u03b8 ,Z distributions for each of the three helicity states of the W and Z bosons are extracted from the Powheg+Pythia MC sample [19]. For each of the gauge bosons, generically denoted as V , the predicted helicity fractions of Powheg+Pythia MC events are determined as a function of p V T and y V by fitting the analytic functions of Eqs. (1) and (2) to the predicted cos \u03b8 ,V distributions in the total phase space. Two dimensional bins as a function of p V T and y V are used. The bin boundaries are optimised such that possible bias on the evolution of the extracted helicity fractions is minimised. The MC templates at detector level representing longitudinal, left-and right-handed states of the W boson are then obtained by reweighting of Powheg+Pythia MC events according to L/0/R are the helicity fractions at generator level, extracted by the fit, of Powheg+Pythia MC events. Similar equations hold for the polarisation of the Z boson. The procedural uncertainty of the reweighting method for the generation of MC templates was estimated to be below 0.5%. Helicity fractions are extracted by the template fit at detector level. To be expressed in a fiducial phase space at particle level, each helicity fraction is then corrected independently for detector efficiencies and QED final-state radiation effects using factors obtained from the simulation. Measured helicity fractions are thus reported at particle level for a fiducial phase space which follows the definition of Sect. 3 with the difference that leptons with kinematics defined before QED final state radiation (\"Born leptons\") are used instead of dressed leptons. Experimental systematic uncertainties detailed in Sect. 9 are considered and treated as nuisance parameters with an assumed Gaussian distribution. Theoretical systematic uncertainties due to the modelling in the event generator used to evaluate the helicity templates are considered. The effects of PDF and QCD scale uncertainties are estimated as detailed in Sect. 9. An additional modelling uncertainty is considered and estimated by comparing predictions from the Powheg+Pythia and MC@NLO MC event generators for the shape of helicity template distributions.",

This measurement establishes the presence of longitudinally polarised W bosons with an observed significance of 4.2 \u03c3 , compared to 3.8 \u03c3 expected. Table 6 shows the main sources of uncertainty in the measurement of the helicity fractions. The measurements are dominated by statistical uncertainties. Good agreement of the measured helicity fractions of both the W and Z bosons with the predictions from Powheg+Pythia and MATRIX is observed. Measured f 0 values agree within 1\u03c3 with the prediction, while f L \u2212 f R values agree within 2 \u03c3 . The Powheg+Pythia and MATRIX predictions are only at NLO and NNLO in QCD, respectively, but, more importantly for polarisation, both calculations use only LO electroweak matrix elements. Therefore, and also because of the still large statistical uncer-  tainties in the measurements, no stringent constraints nor clear inconsistencies between measurements and predictions can be deduced. The values of f 0 and f L \u2212 f R measured in W \u00b1 Z events are shown in Fig. 10 for the W and Z bosons, respectively.",
