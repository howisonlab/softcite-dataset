            "text": "Proton-nucleus collisions at ultrarelativistic energies provide an opportunity to understand the role of the nuclear environment in modifying hard scattering rates. Several physics effects are expected to induce deviations from a simple proportionality between the scattering rate and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions [1]. First, nuclear shadowing effects have long been observed in deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei, as well as in protonnucleus collisions, indicating that nucleons embedded in a nucleus have a modified structure. This modification tends to suppress hadron production at low to moderate momentum, and is addressed by a variety of theoretical approaches [2,3]. Some of these approaches describe hadron production cross sections in terms of a universal set of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF), which are parameterized as modifications to the free nucleon PDFs [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Second, energy loss in \"cold nuclear matter\" is expected to modify hadron production rates at high transverse momentum (p T ) [13][14][15][16]. Third, a relative enhancement of hadron pro-E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. duction rates at moderate momenta is observed in proton-nucleus collisions [17], which can be attributed to initial-state scattering of the incoming nucleon [18,19] or radial flow effects [20]. Finally, the appearance of \"ridge-like\" structures in high-multiplicity pp and p + Pb events [21][22][23][24][25] suggests that small collision systems have the same hydrodynamic origin as Pb + Pb events [26], or that there are already strong correlations in the initial state from gluon saturation [27]. All these effects can be explored experimentally by the measurement of charged-hadron production as a function of transverse momentum.",

The R CP is presented as a function of pseudorapidity (\u03b7) rather than y * since both numerator and denominator are from the same colliding systems. Measurements of R pPb and R CP provide useful input for constraining models of shadowing, energy loss and radial flow effects. They should also provide useful input for the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions, in particular as a function of proton impact parameter [6]. The absolute values of the nuclear modification depend on the T Pb values and should be interpreted with respect to the assumptions underlying the particular model used to calculate the normalization. A recent ATLAS publication [29] has reported measurements of the mean charged-particle multiplicity as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality and explored the relationship between the centrality dependence of the particle production and models of the initial nuclear geometry. The results presented here utilize the same centrality definition and geometric models, but build upon that work by exploring the p T , \u03b7 and y * dependence of per-event charged-particle yields in p + Pb collisions at a centreof-mass energy",

The transverse energies in the forward calorimeter are evaluated at an energy scale calibrated for electromagnetic showers and are not corrected for hadronic response [44]. Centrality intervals are defined in terms of percentiles of the E Pb T distribution after accounting for an estimated inefficiency of approximately (2 \u00b1 2) % for inelastic p + Pb events to satisfy the applied event selection criteria. This inefficiency affects mainly the most peripheral events. The following centrality intervals are used in this analysis: 0-1%, 1-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-60%, 60-90% (with the 0-1% interval defined by the highest E Pb T values). Since the composition of the events and the uncertainty on the inelastic p + Pb events selection efficiency in the most peripheral 90-100% interval is not well constrained, these events are excluded from the analysis, and events from the 60-90% centrality interval are used as the reference for R CP .

To estimate this uncertainty, the basic requirements on the number of detector hits and the track impact parameters were relaxed and tightened in both data and MC simulation. For the relaxed criteria the d 0 and z 0 sin \u03b8 impact parameters for p + Pb (pp) samples are required to be less than 2 mm (3 mm) and significance conditions are not required. To tighten the selection, tracks are required to have at least seven SCT hits, traverse an active module in each layer of the pixel detector, and the impact parameter requirement is changed to be less than 1 mm and 2 mm for p + Pb and pp samples respectively. These variations produce up to a 2% shift in the fully corrected chargedparticle yield. The uncertainty in the charged-particle yield due to simulation of inactive material is estimated using dedicated p + Pb simulated samples in which the inactive material is increased in the central and forward regions of the inner detector [57]. The net effect on the per-event charged-particle yields is found to vary from 0.5% at low pseudorapidity to 4% at high pseudorapidity, but is independent of centrality. The systematic uncertainty estimated in this way from p + Pb simulated samples is applied to both p + Pb and pp data, taking into account the rapidity boost.",

The results show the same basic features for the nuclear modification factors, although strict quantitative agreement is not expected as each measurement uses different rapidity intervals for the centrality determination and apply different event selection criteria to reject diffractive collisions.

The data are integrated over \u22121.8 < y * < 1.3 for R pPb and |\u03b7| < 2.3 for R CP . The data from the 0-1% centrality interval show similar features in all panels. Both R pPb and R CP increase with transverse momentum, reaching a maximum value at approximately p T \u223c 3 GeV and then decrease until reaching p T \u223c 8 GeV. Above this value, the ratios are approximately constant within the experimental uncertainties. The R pPb and R CP distributions in the region of the peak, 1 < p T < 8 GeV, have larger values for central events than for peripheral events. The magnitude of the peak depends quantitatively on the choice of geometrical model: the results obtained using the Glauber model have larger peak values than either of the Glauber-Gribov models. The magnitude of the peak relative to the constant (plateau) region (p T 8 GeV) is compatible for R CP and R pPb given the systematic uncertainties. The peripheral events show a smaller rise at low p T . There is also only a slight indication of a peak at p T \u223c 3 GeV in R CP and no pronounced indication of a peak in the R pPb . The magnitude of R pPb and R CP in the constant region (p T 8 GeV) is significantly above unity in the most central collisions for the Glauber model.

The constant region above p T \u2248 8 GeV is less sensitive to the different centrality and (pseudo)rapidity intervals. Measurements of the absolute magnitudes of R pPb integrated over centrality and averaged over rapidity are similar for different geometric models, although their centrality dependence is strongly influenced by the choice of geometric model.

The ln( \u221a s)-based interpolation is taken as the default in the analysis and the\u221a s-based interpolation is used to assess the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of interpolation function. Possible distortions introduced by the interpolation algorithm are evaluated using MC simulations based on Pythia8. The ratio of the simulated differential cross section at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV to the cross section interpolated with ln( \u221a s)-based or \u221a s-based function, obtained from simulated samples at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, is taken as a multiplicative correction factor to be applied to the data. The correction factors obtained using Pythia8 and Herwig++ are presented in Fig. 2(a) for the region \u22121.8 < y * < 1.3. The correction obtained from Pythia8 is the default applied to the data and the correction obtained using Herwig++ is used to assess the systematic uncertainty as discussed in Section 7, and calculated separately for either the ln( \u221a s)-based or \u221a s-based interpolation functions. Fig. 2(b) summarizes the relative shapes of the differential cross sections measured at \u221a s = 2.76, 7 and 5.02 TeV, with the last ob-",
