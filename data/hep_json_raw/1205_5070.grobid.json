Significant strength is found in 73 decay modes of \u03a5(1S) and 17 decay modes of \u03a5(2S), with branching fractions ranging from 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 110 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .

            "text": "The hadronic decays of charmonium S-wave states have been extensively studied. For example, for J/\u03c8 (\u03c8(1S)) and \u03c8(2S) 97 and 70 exclusive hadronic decays, respectively, have been measured [1]. In sharp contrast, branching fractions for not even a single exclusive hadronic decay of \u03a5(1S) or \u03a5(2S) have been measured, and only five upper limits have been established for \u03a5(1S) [1]. In this paper we report on the first measurements of exclusive decays of both \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) into 4 \u2212 10 light hadrons (including up to 2\u03c0 0 ) using the CLEO III detector. For \u03a5(1S), branching fractions for 73 decays have been measured and upper limits have been established for 27 decays. For \u03a5(2S), branching fractions for 17 decays have been measured and upper limits have been established for 83 decays.",

This feature results from the isospin dependence of the summed branching fractions. Long ago, Pais [3] had calculated the isospin dependence of the decays containing neutral and charged pions, in particular the ratios of decays (n \u2212 2)\u03c0 \u00b1 2\u03c0 0 /n\u03c0 \u00b1 for n = 2 \u2212 8. In Table IV, we present the results from our measurements of \u03a5(1S) decays.
