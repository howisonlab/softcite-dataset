The data were collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during Run 2 between 2015 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The measurements are performed in a fiducial volume defined at parton level. Events with exactly one photon, one electron and one muon of opposite sign, and at least two jets, of which at least one is b-tagged, are selected. The fiducial cross-section is measured to be 39.6 +2.7   \u22122.3 fb. Differential cross-sections as functions of several observables are compared with state-ofthe-art Monte Carlo simulations and next-to-leading-order theoretical calculations. These include cross-sections as functions of photon kinematic variables, angular variables related to the photon and the leptons, and angular separations between the two leptons in the event. All measurements are in agreement with the predictions from the Standard Model.",

Furthermore, measurements of the inclusive and differential cross-sections of this process are of particular interest because these topologies are sensitive, for instance, to new physics through anomalous dipole moments of the top quark [1][2][3] and in the context of effective field theories [4].",

Additionally, the cross-sections are measured at parton level rather than at particle level to allow comparison with the theory calculation in refs. [10,11]. The calculation constitutes the first full computation for tt production with a hard final-state photon in hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), pp \u2192 bW bW \u03b3, including all resonant and non-resonant diagrams, interferences, and off-shell effects of the top quarks and the W bosons. Therefore, in this paper the combined cross-section of resonant tt\u03b3 and non-resonant tW \u03b3 production is measured, referred to as signal in the following. Example Feynman diagrams at leading order in QCD for tt\u03b3 and tW \u03b3 production are shown in figure 1.",

Dedicated samples with a photon in the ME were generated for the tt\u03b3 and tW \u03b3 final states, as well as for V \u03b3 processes with additional jets. Here, V denotes either a W or a Z boson. Although no photons were generated at ME level in the inclusive samples, initial-and final-state radiation of photons is accounted for by the showering algorithm. Combining inclusive and dedicated samples for the modelling of processes might result in double-counting photon radiation in certain phase-space regions. As a consequence, a procedure to remove overlaps between the inclusive and dedicated samples was performed. Photon radiation simulated at ME level in dedicated samples achieves higher accuracy than the photon radiation in the showering algorithm. On the other hand, kinematic JHEP09(2020)049 category represents a minor background contribution. The third category is called prompt \u03b3 background and contains any type of background process with a prompt photon. The background contribution from tt production with a photon produced in an additional pp interaction in the same bunch crossing was found to be negligible. This was estimated by comparing the significance of the distance in z between the photon's origin and the primary vertex in data and simulation.",

This is done in a way that mimics the event selection as defined in the theoretical calculation. Objects at parton level are taken from the MC simulation history. Photons and leptons are selected as stable particles after final-state radiation. The leptons ( = e, \u00b5) must originate from W -boson decays and they are dressed with nearby photons within a cone of size of \u2206R = 0.1 around them and must have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Only events with exactly one electron and one muon are considered. Events with leptons originating from an intermediate \u03c4 -lepton in the top-quark decay chain are not considered. The b-jets at parton level in the calculation from refs. [10,11] are jets clustered with the anti-k t algorithm with a distance parameter of R = 0.4. Since showering and hadroni-JHEP09(2020)049 sation effects are not considered in this calculation, the jets correspond to the b-quarks from the top-quark decay (with an additional parton in the cases where the NLO real emission leads to a parton close by a b-quark). To mimic this definition in the LO MC simulation, parton-level b-jets are defined as follows. The anti-k t algorithm with a distance parameter R = 0.4 is applied to all partons that are radiated from the two b-quarks (including the b-quarks themselves) and from the two initial partons. The jets that include a b-quark from the decay of a top quark are selected as b-jets. The event is kept if there are two b-jets satisfying p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Exactly one photon with E T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.37 is required. Photons are required to be isolated from nearby jets by imposing a modified cone approach as described in ref. [58], as it is also done in the theory calculation in refs. [10,11], to ensure soft and collinear safety.

The total integrated luminosity is denoted by L, and \u2206X k represents the bin width.

The unfolding method relies on the Bayesian probability formula, starting from a given prior of the parton-level distribution and iteratively updating it with the posterior distribution. The binning choices of the unfolded observables take into account the detector resolution and the expected statistical uncertainty. The bin width has to be larger than twice the resolution, and the statistical uncertainty is required to be around or below 10% across all bins, with the latter being the limiting factor in most of the cases. The resolution of the lepton and photon momenta is very high and, therefore, the fraction of events migrating from one bin to another is small. In all bins, the purity, defined as the fraction of reconstructed events that originate from the same bin at parton level, is larger than 80%, and it is above 90% for all observables except for the p T of the photon. The number of iterations chosen is two, which provides good convergence of the unfolding distribution and a statistically stable result.  For illustration purposes, the migration matrix is presented in the left panel of figure 4, while the right panel shows the efficiency, outside-migration fraction and the resulting C correction factor obtained for the distribution of the photon p T . The performance of the unfolding procedure is tested for possible biases from the choice of input model. It was verified that when reweighting the shape of the signal simulation by up to 50% bin-by-bin with respect to the nominal shape, the unfolding procedure based on the nominal response matrix reproduces the altered shapes.",

The uncertainties associated with the parton shower and hadronisation are estimated by comparing the nominal simulation with alternative showering by Herwig 7. Uncertainties in the modelling of final-state radiation are estimated by evaluating the effects of varying four different parameters in the Powheg + Pythia 8 generator set-up described in the following. Uncertainties due to the renormalisation and factorisation scales are estimated by varying them up and down independently by a factor of two relative to the default scale choice. These scale variations are implemented with corresponding weights which are available as part of the nominal MC sample. Uncertainties due to the value of \u03b1 S used in the ISR parton shower modelling are estimated by comparing the nominal Powheg + Pythia 8 simulation with alternative samples that correspond to higher and lower radiation parameter settings in the A14 tune, controlled by the var3c parameter in Pythia 8. This parameter is varied within its uncertainties corresponding to variations of \u03b1 S (m Z ) between 0.115 and 0.140. An additional ISR uncertainty is obtained by comparing the nominal sample with an additional one where the h damp parameter, which controls the p T of the first additional emission, is varied by a factor of two as supported by measurements reported in ref.

For the estimation of efficiencies and acceptance corrections, a LO Monte Carlo simulation of the 2 \u2192 7 process pp \u2192 e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bdbb\u03b3 was used for the tt\u03b3 part of the signal. The contribution from tW \u03b3 was estimated from a combination of LO Monte Carlo simulations for the 2 \u2192 3 process pp \u2192 tW \u03b3 and the 2 \u2192 6 process pp \u2192 e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bdb\u03b3. The simulations include initial-and final-state radiation of the photon from all involved objects in the matrix element. The resonant top-quark production is taken into account in the JHEP09(2020)049   [10,11]. The uncertainty in the calculation corresponds to the total scale and PDF uncertainties. The PDF uncertainty is rescaled to the 68% CL. The lower part of each plot shows the ratio of the prediction to the data.

The PDF uncertainty is rescaled to the 68% CL. The lower parts of each plot show the ratio of the prediction to the data and the ratio of the NLO calculation to the MC simulations. The results are compared with the prediction from the LO Monte Carlo simulations and also a dedicated NLO theory prediction which includes all off-shell contributions. The measured fiducial inclusive cross-section of \u03c3 = 39.6 +2.7 \u22122.3 fb is found to be in good agreement with the predicted NLO cross-section. All considered differential distributions are also found to be well described by the NLO theory prediction. ",
