The search uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The dominant sources of background are estimated using parameterized extrapolations, based on observables at medium jet multiplicity, to predict the b-tagged jet multiplicity distribution at the higher jet multiplicities used in the search. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed and 95% confidence-level limits are extracted constraining four simplified models of R-parity-violating supersymmetry that feature either gluino or top-squark pair production. The exclusion limits reach as high as 2.1 TeV in gluino mass and 1.2 TeV in top-squark mass in the models considered. In addition, an upper limit is set on the cross-section for Standard Model tttt production of 60 fb (6.5 \u00d7 the Standard Model prediction) at 95% confidence level. Finally, model-independent limits are set on the contribution from new phenomena to the signal-region yields.",

            "text": "The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has carried out a large number of searches for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. These searches cover a broad range of different final-state particles and kinematics. However, one gap in the search coverage, as pointed out in refs. [1,2], is in final states with one or more leptons, many jets and no-or-little missing transverse momentum (the magnitude of which is denoted by -1 -JHEP09(2017)088 E miss T ). Such a search is presented in this article, considering final states with an isolated lepton (electron or muon), at least eight to twelve jets (depending on the jet transverse momentum threshold), either zero or many b-tagged jets, and with no requirement on E miss T . This search has potential sensitivity to a large number of BSM physics models. In this article, model-independent limits on the possible contribution of BSM physics to several single-bin signal regions are presented. In addition, four R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric (SUSY [3][4][5][6][7][8]) benchmark models are used to interpret the results. In this case, a multi-bin fit to the two-dimensional space of jet-multiplicity and b-tagged jet multiplicity is used to constrain the models. The dominant Standard Model (SM) background arises from top-quark pair production and W/Z+jets production, with at least one lepton produced in the vector boson decay. The theoretical modelling of these backgrounds at high jet multiplicity suffers from large uncertainties, so they are estimated from the data by extrapolating the b-tagged jet multiplicity distribution extracted at moderate jet multiplicities to the high jet multiplicities of the search region. Previous searches targeting similar RPV SUSY models have been carried out by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [9][10][11][12].",

For these cases, signal events are produced with either one (g \u2192tt \u2192tbs model) or two (g \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 qqqq /\u03bd andt \u2192 tH/B models) additional partons in the matrix element and using the A14 [33] tune. The parton luminosities are provided by the NNPDF23LO [34] PDF set.",

The jets are corrected for energy deposits from pile-up collisions using the method suggested in ref. [65] and calibrated with ATLAS data in ref. [66]: a contribution equal to the product of the jet area and the median energy density of the event is subtracted from the jet energy. Further corrections derived from MC simulation and data are used to calibrate on average the energies of jets to the scale of their constituent particles [67]. In the search, three jet p T thresholds of 40 GeV, 60 GeV and 80 GeV are used, with all jets required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4. To minimize the contribution from jets arising from pile-up interactions, the selected jets must satisfy a loose jet vertex tagger (JVT) requirement [68], where JVT is an algorithm that uses tracking and primary vertex information to determine if a given jet originates from the primary vertex. The chosen working point has an efficiency of 94% at a jet p T of 40 GeV and is nearly fully efficient above 60 GeV for jets originating from the hard parton-parton scatter. This selection reduces the number of jets originating from, or heavily contaminated by, pile-up interactions, to a negligible level. Events with jet candidates originating from detector noise or non-collision background are rejected if any of the jet candidates satisfy the 'LooseBad' quality criteria, described in ref. [69]. The coverage of the calorimeter and the jet reconstruction techniques allow high-jet-multiplicity final states to be reconstructed efficiently.

The determination of the W +jets background relies on control regions containing the remaining events with exactly five, six or seven jets, and zero b-tags, which, for each jet multiplicity, are split according to the electric charge of the highest-p T lepton. The expected charge asymmetry in W +jets events is taken from MC simulation separately for five-jet, six-jet and seven-jet events and used to constrain the W +jets normalization from the data using these control regions. Although all parameters are determined in a global likelihood fit, the most powerful constraint on the absolute normalization comes from the five-jet control regions, and the dominant constraints on the c 0 and c 1 parameters originate from the combination of the five-jet, six-jet and seven-jet control regions. The contamination by tt events in the Z+jets two-lepton control regions is negligible, whereas in the control regions used to estimate the W +jets normalization it is significant and is discussed in section 6.2.

The extrapolation of the b-tag multiplicity distribution to higher jet multiplicities starts from the assumption that the difference between the b-tag multiplicity distribution in events with j and j + 1 jets arises mainly from the production of additional jets, and can be described by a fixed probability that the additional jet is b-tagged. Given the small mis-tag rate, this probability is dominated by the probability that the additional jet is a heavy-flavour jet which is b-tagged.

The probability for loose-prompt leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria is obtained using a Z \u2192 data sample and is modelled as a function of the lepton p T . The probability for loose FNP leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria is determined from a data control region enriched in non-prompt leptons requiring a loose lepton, multiple jets, low E miss T [84,85] and low transverse mass. 8 The efficiencies are measured as a function of lepton candidate p T after subtracting the contribution from prompt-lepton processes and are assumed to be independent of the jet multiplicity. 9 ",

Uncertainties related to the theoretical modelling of the specific processes and due to the modelling of the detector response in simulated events are only relevant for the minor backgrounds, which are taken from MC simulation, and for the estimates of the signal yields after selections. For the W/Z+jets background estimation, the uncertainty related to the assumed scaling behaviour is taken from studies of this behaviour in W +jets and Z+jets MC simulation, as well as in \u03b3+jets and multi-jet data control regions chosen to be kinematically similar to the search selection (see figure 3). No evidence is seen for a deviation from the assumed scaling behaviour and the statistical precision of these methods is used as an uncertainty (up to 18% for the highest jet-multiplicity bins). The expected uncertainty of the charge asymmetry for W +jets production is 3-5% from PDF variations [86], but in the seven-jet region, the uncertainty is dominated by the limited number of MC events (up to 10% for the 80 GeV jet p T threshold). The uncertainty in the shape of the b-tag multiplicity distribution in W +jets and Z+jets events is derived by comparing different MC generator set-ups (e.g. varying the renormalization and factorization scale and the parton-shower model parameters). It is seen to grow as a function of jet multiplicity and is about 50% for events with five jets, after which the MC statistical uncertainty becomes very large. A conservative uncertainty of 100% is therefore assigned to the fractional contribution from W +b and W +c events for all jet slices considered, which has a very small impact on the final result as the background from W boson production with additional heavy flavour jets is small compared to that from top quark pair production. In addition, the uncertainties related to the b-tagging efficiency and mis-tag rate are taken into account in the uncertainty in the W/Z+jets b-tag template.",

An example signal model is also shown to illustrate the separation between the signal and the background achieved, as well as the level of signal-event leakage into lower b-tag and jet-multiplicity bins. The bottom panel of each figure shows the background prediction using MC simulation. For high b-tag multiplicities (\u2265 3), the MC simulation strongly underestimates the background contributions compared to the data-driven background estimation. This effect has been observed before [89,90] and shows that the MC simulations are not able to correctly describe final states with high b-jet multiplicity. In addition, the MC simulation predicts too many events at low b-jet multiplicity, which is likely to be due to a mismodelling of the W +jets production at high jet multiplicity.
