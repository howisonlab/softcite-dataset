The LHCb detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum 2 resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV. The impact parameter (IP) is defined as the minimum distance of approach of the track with respect to the primary vertex. For tracks with large transverse momentum, p T , with respect to the proton beam direction, the IP resolution is approximately 20 m. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [7].

The detection efficiency is obtained from simulations and is a product of the geometrical acceptance of the detector, the combined reconstruction and selection efficiency, and the trigger efficiency. Since the efficiency to detect the J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 final state is not uniform across the Dalitz plane, the efficiency is averaged according to the default Dalitz model. Small corrections are applied to account for differences between the simulation and the data. To ensure that the p and p T distributions of the generated B meson are correct, we weight the simulated samples to match the distributions of the corresponding data. Since the normalization channel has a different number of charged tracks than the signal channel, we weight the simulated samples with the tracking efficiency ratio by comparing the data and simulations in the track's p and p T bins. Finally, we weight the simulations according to the kaon identification efficiency. The average of the weights is assigned as a correction factor.
