No excess is observed above the estimated background and limits are placed on the mass of long-lived particles in various supersymmetric models. Long-lived tau sleptons in models with gauge-mediated symmetry breaking are excluded up to masses between 440 and 385 GeV for tan \u03b2 between 10 and 50, with a 290 GeV limit in the case where only direct tau slepton production is considered. In the context of simplified LeptoSUSY models, where sleptons are stable and have a mass of 300 GeV, squark and gluino masses are excluded up to a mass of 1500 and 1360 GeV, respectively. Directly produced charginos, in simplified models where they are nearly degenerate to the lightest neutralino, are excluded up to a mass of 620 GeV. R-hadrons, composites containing a gluino, bottom squark or top squark, are excluded up to a mass of 1270, 845 and 900 GeV, respectively, using the full detector; and up to a mass of 1260, 835 and 870 GeV using an approach disregarding information from the muon spectrometer.",

A search for long-lived sleptons identified in both the inner detector (ID) and in the muon spectrometer (MS) is therefore performed (\"slepton search\"). The search is optimised for GMSB and LeptoSUSY models. In the former, the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and the light tau slepton (\u03c4 1 ) is the long-lived, next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The\u03c4 1 , the lightest\u03c4 mass eigenstate resulting from the mixture of right-handed and left-handed super-partners of the \u03c4 lepton, is predominantly the partner of the right-handed lepton in all models considered here. In addition to GMSB production, results are also interpreted for the case of direct pair production of charged sleptons, independently of the mass spectrum of other SUSY particles. The recent discovery of the Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV [30,31] disfavours minimal GMSB within reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For the Higgs boson to have such mass, the top squark mass would have to be several TeV, and in GMSB the slepton masses are strictly related to the squark masses. However, modifications to minimal GMSB can easily accommodate the observed Higgs mass without changing the sparticle masses [32][33][34]. The LeptoSUSY models, characterised by final states with high multiplicity of leptons and jets, are studied in the context of a simplified model, where all the neutralinos and charginos are decoupled with the exception of the\u03c7 0 1 , and the sleptons are long-lived and degenerate, with a mass set to 300 GeV, a value motivated by exclusion limits of previous searches [35]. In these models a substantial fraction of the events would contain two LLP candidates, a feature also used to discriminate signal from background.",

The chargino signature in the detector JHEP01(2015)068 would be the same as for a slepton, but the dominant production is in chargino-neutralino (\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 1 ) pairs, where the neutralino leaves the apparatus undetected. As a result, the event would have one LLP and significant missing transverse momentum ( p miss T , with magnitude denoted by E miss T ). This signature is pursued in a dedicated \"chargino search\". Coloured LLPs (q andg) would hadronise forming R-hadrons, bound states composed of the LLP and light SM quarks or gluons. They may emerge as charged or neutral states from the pp collision and be converted to a state with a different charge by interactions with the detector material, and thus arrive as neutral, charged or doubly charged particles in the MS. Searches for R-hadrons are performed following two different approaches: using all available detector information (\"full-detector R-hadron search\"), or disregarding all information from the MS (\"MS-agnostic R-hadron search\"). The latter case is independent of the modelling of R-hadron interactions with material in the calorimeters.",

The effect of multiple pp interactions in the same or a nearby bunch crossing (pile-up) is taken into account by overlaying additional minimum-bias collision events simulated using Pythia8 [48] v. 8.170 and reweighting the distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing in MC simulation to that observed in data. All events are subsequently processed using the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis chain as the data. The GMSB samples are generated, using Herwig++ [49] v. 2.5.2 along with the UEEE3 [50] tune and the CTEQ6L1 [51] parton distribution function (PDF) set, with the following model parameters: number of super-multiplets in the messenger sector, N 5 = 3, messenger mass scale, m messenger = 250 TeV, sign of the Higgsino mass parameter, sign(\u00b5) = 1, and C grav , the scale factor for the gravitino mass which determines the NLSP lifetime, set to 5000 to ensure that the NLSP does not decay inside the detector. The ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan \u03b2) is varied between 10 and 50. The SUSY-breaking scale (\u039b) is chosen between 80 and 160 TeV and the corresponding\u03c4 1 masses vary from 175 to 510 GeV, in order to cover the regions of parameter space accessible to this analysis and not excluded by previous searches. The masses of the right-handed\u1ebd (or\u03bc) are larger than that of\u03c4 1 by 2.7-93 GeV for tan \u03b2 values between 10 and 50.

Therefore the slepton searches require at least two loosely identified muon-like objects reconstructed using the techniques described in reference [69], which will be called LLP candidates in the following. By applying this selection criterion, background from W and multi-jet events is reduced. Two sets of selection criteria are applied on a per-candidate basis with details given below. A loose selection with high efficiency is used to select candidates in events where there are two LLP candidates, since a background event would very rarely have two high-p T muons, both with poorly measured \u03b2 and a large reconstructed mass.

The momentum pdf is produced from candidates that pass the momentum requirement, but have \u03b2 < 0.90 and \u03b2\u03b3 < 2.5, while the \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b3 pdfs are produced by selecting candidates which pass the respective \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b3 selection and have momentum in the range 70 GeV < p < 180 GeV. This ensures that enough events are selected for the background pdfs to reflect the signal region even at high masses. The independence of p, \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b3 required for this approach to work is achieved by considering five equidistant regions in |\u03b7|. The typical number of events in the pdfs used for generating the background estimate is O(10 4 ).",

For GMSB models with parameters in this range, strong production of squarks and gluinos is suppressed due to their large masses. Directly produced sleptons constitute 30-63% of the GMSB cross-section, and the corresponding\u03c4 1 production rates depend only on th\u1ebd \u03c4 1 mass and the mass difference between the right-handed\u1ebd (or\u03bc) and the\u03c4 1 . Thus the same analysis constrains a simple model with only pair-produced sleptons which are long-lived, or which themselves decay to long-lived sleptons of another flavour. Such direct production is excluded at 95% CL up to\u03c4 1 masses of 373 to 330 GeV for models with slepton mass splittings of 2.7-93 GeV. The slepton direct-production limits are shown in figure 6. Figure 7 shows the cross-section limits on direct\u03c4 1 production for the case where the mass splitting from the other sleptons is very large. As the theoretical prediction as well as the according uncertainty bands overlap almost entirely for various values of tan \u03b2, only the curve for tan \u03b2 = 10 is shown. Masses below 286 GeV are excluded if only\u03c4 1 is produced. The values for direct\u03c4 1 -only production are also used in figure 6 at very high mass splittings. Finally, in the context of the GMSB model, 30-50% of the GMSB cross-section arises from direct production of charginos and neutralinos (dominated by\u03c7 0 1\u03c7 \u00b1 1 production) and subsequent decay to\u03c4 1 . Figure 8 shows the 95% CL lower limits on the\u03c7 0 1 and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 mass when the final decay product is a long-lived\u03c4 1 . In the samples used to derive these limits, the\u03c7 0 1 and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses are closely related by GMSB, as represented by the values on the two x-axes. The mass of the\u03c4 1 decreases with increasing tan \u03b2 and increases with the\u03c7 0 1 and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses. At low\u03c7 0 1 and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses and large tan \u03b2, the cross-section limits are thus affected by the amount of background in the\u03c4 1 mass search region, which starts at 120 GeV for tan \u03b2 = 50 and at 170 GeV for tan \u03b2 = 10.

Figure 6. 95% CL excluded regions for directly produced sleptons in the plane m(\u02dc )-m(\u03c4 1 ) vs. m(\u03c4 1 ). The excluded region is is shown in blue.

The observed limit is shown as solid red line with a \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainty band drawn as dashed red lines.  Figure 7. Cross-section upper limits as a function of the\u03c4 1 mass for direct\u03c4 1 production and three values of tan \u03b2. The expected limit for tan \u03b2 = 10 is drawn as a dashed black line with \u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 uncertainty bands drawn in green and yellow, respectively. The observed limits for three values of tan \u03b2 are shown as solid lines with markers. The theoretical cross-section prediction for tan \u03b2 = 10 is shown as a coloured \u00b11\u03c3 band, and does not vary significantly for the other tan \u03b2 values.  Figure 8. Cross-section upper limits as a function of the\u03c7 1 mass for\u03c4 1 sleptons resulting from the decay of directly produced charginos and neutralinos in GMSB. Observed limits are given as a solid black line with markers. Expected limits for tan \u03b2 = 10 are drawn as a dashed black line with \u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 uncertainty bands drawn in green and yellow, respectively. The theoretical cross-section prediction (dominated by\u03c7 0 1\u03c7 + 1 production) is shown as a coloured \u00b11\u03c3 band. Depending on the hypothesis and to a small extent on tan \u03b2, in these models, the chargino mass is 210 to 260 GeV higher than the neutralino mass. Limits on LeptoSUSY scenarios are set on squarks and gluinos decaying to long-lived sleptons within the LeptoSUSY model. The exclusion region in the plane m(g) vs. m(q) is shown in figure 9. Squark and gluino masses are excluded at 95% CL up to a mass of 1500 and 1360 GeV, respectively, in simplified LeptoSUSY models where sleptons are stable and degenerate, with a mass of 300 GeV, and all neutralinos (except\u03c7 0 1 ) and charginos are decoupled.",
