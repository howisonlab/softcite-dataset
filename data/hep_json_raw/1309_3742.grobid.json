            "text": "The current SM prediction for the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 branching fraction suffers from uncertainties originating from the na\u00efve factor- ization approach, radiative corrections, calculation of the longdistance contribution (e.g. B \u2192 K K * rescattering), and \u03c9-\u03c6 mixing [12]. The latter is the main source of uncertainty. The physical \u03c9 and \u03c6 meson states do not coincide exactly with the ideal (|uu + |dd )/ \u221a 2 and |ss states, respectively. They appear to be mixtures of these two states characterized by a small mixing angle \u03b4 V [13,14], which depends on the magnitude of SU(3) symmetry breaking and can be determined in the framework of chiral perturbation theory. However, more sophisticated treatments based on the full \u03c1 0 -\u03c9-\u03c6 mixing scheme suggest that \u03b4 V is mass dependent, i.e. takes different values at the \u03c9 and \u03c6 masses [15,16]. In the QCD factorization approach, the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 branching fraction is predicted to be in the range (5 \u2212 10) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [3] if \u03c9-\u03c6 mixing is neglected, but can be enhanced up to 0.6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 [12,17] depending on the value of \u03b4 V . However, the effect of \u03c9-\u03c6 mixing has not been observed in a recent search for B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 [18]. Values of the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 branching fraction in excess of 10 \u22127 would be indicative of non-SM physics. Open access under CC BY license.",

The results are based on a data sample collected during the 2011 pp run of the Large Hadron Collider at a centreof-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 . The \u03c6 meson is reconstructed in the K + K \u2212 final state.

In order to suppress several systematic effects, the primary observables measured in this analysis are the difference of CP-violating charge asymmetries (2) and the branching fraction ratio B(B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 )/B(B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 ), which are then converted to results on A CP (B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 ) and B(B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 ) using the best known values of A CP (B \u00b1 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K \u00b1 ) [1,20] and B(B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 ) [1]. The choice of B \u00b1 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K \u00b1 as reference channel and other features of the analysis follow the approach adopted in inclusive studies of B \u00b1 \u2192 K + K \u2212 K \u00b1 decays with the same data set [5].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [22]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The direction of the magnetic field of the spectrometer dipole magnet is reversed regularly.",

The B \u00b1 candidate decays considered in this analysis must belong to one of two exclusive categories of events, called TOS (triggered on signal) or TIS (triggered independently of signal). A TOS event is triggered at the hardware stage by one of the candidate's final-state particles being compatible with a transverse energy deposit greater than 3.5 GeV in the hadron calorimeter. A TIS event does not satisfy the TOS definition and is triggered at the hardware stage by activity in the rest of the event. All candidates must pass a software trigger requiring a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a large scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the tracks and a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one track should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP with respect to any PV greater than 16, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without the considered track.

The peaking signal is modelled with a Crystal Ball function [31] modified such that both the upper and lower tails are power laws. The mean and the width \u03c3 B of the Crystal Ball function are free in the fit, while the tail parameters are determined from simulation. The partially-reconstructed background is described with an ARGUS function [32] convoluted with a Gaussian resolution function of the same \u03c3 B as the B \u00b1 signal. The m K K distribution is described with two contributions: a peaking term centred on the \u03c6 mass, described with a relativistic Breit-Wigner function convoluted with a Gaussian resolution function of free width, and a linear term originating from nonresonant, S-wave, or random combinations of two kaons. The above three m K Kh contributions and two m K K contributions lead to six components for each subsample: the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6h \u00b1 signal, the nonresonant B \u00b1 \u2192 K + K \u2212 h \u00b1 background, the partially-reconstructed b-hadron backgrounds with or without a true \u03c6 meson (for example B \u2192 \u03c6h \u00b1 \u03c0 or B \u2192 K + K \u2212 h \u00b1 \u03c0 ), and the combinatorial backgrounds with or without a true \u03c6 meson.

The advantage of introducing the \u03b4m observable is to connect the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 shapes in the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 and B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 samples, thereby constraining the misidentified B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 component in the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 sample using the large signal in the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K \u00b1 sample.

However, this introduces a bias because the \u03b4m distribution, which is not accounted for in the likelihood, is not the same for all components [33]. To reduce this bias, the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 sample is divided into four bins of \u03b4m, each with its own eight components. This procedure reduces the bias on the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 signal yield to a negligible level.",

Such an effect is absent for the TIS subsample. Another small contribution, due to the TOS events that would still be accepted by the hardware trigger level without considering the particles from the B + candidate decay, has been included in the trigger systematic uncertainty.
