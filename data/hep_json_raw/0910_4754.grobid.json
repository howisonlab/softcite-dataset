The results of this study are that no evidence for coherent pion production is observed, and SciBooNE set 90% confidence level upper limits on the cross section ratio of charged current coherent pion production to the total charged current cross section. Recently proposed new coherent pion models predict a production of charged current coherent pion events just below the SciBooNE's upper limit. Motivated by this, we performed a search for charged current coherent pion production using SciBooNE's collected antineutrino data since antineutrino data are expected to be more sensitive to look at coherent pion production than neutrino data.",

            "text": "Because SciBooNE does not have a magnetized detector, we cannot distinguish neutrino and antineutrino interactions by the charge of the final state muons. However, event topology in antineutrino interactions differ from neutrino's. SciBar is uniquely suited to provide a measurement of the wrong-sign contamination in the antineutrino beam. We exploit the fact that the fine-grained SciBar tracking detector can differentiate between final states with protons versus neutrons. Hence we can distinguish neutrino versus antineutrino charged current quasi elastic (CC-QE) interactions on an event-by-event basis: \u03bd \u00b5 + n \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 + p and\u03bd \u00b5 + p \u2192 \u00b5 + + n. This is done based on their differing final state composition: CC-QE neutrino interactions are expected to have two tracks (one each from the muon and proton) while antineutrino interactions are expected to have only one track (from the muon), since the neutron is not detected. Figures 2 and 3 show the selected 1-track (\u00b5) events and 2-track \u00b5 + p events in the antineutrino mode sample. According to the MC simulation, the purity of right-sign (\u03bd) in the 1-track sample is \u223c 80%, and wrong-sign fraction   ",

Events with \u2206\u03b8 p larger than 20 degrees are selected to further reduce the CC-QE contamination. Further selections are applied in order to isolate charged current coherent pion events from charged current resonant pion events which are the dominant backgrounds for this analysis. In the case of charged current coherent pion events, both the muon and pion tracks are directed forward. Events in which the track angle of the pion candidate with respect to the beam direction is less than 90 degrees are selected. To separate further charged current coherent pion events from charged current resonant pion events, additional protons with momentum below the tracking threshold are detected by their large energy deposition around the vertex, so-called vertex activity. We search for the maximum deposited energy in a strip around the vertex, an area of 12.5 cm\u00d712.5 cm in both views. Events with energy deposition greater than 10 MeV are considered to have activity at the vertex. In this paper, we define \"charged current coherent pion sample\" which do not have activity and its \"counter-sample\" that have activity.

Figure 7 shows the reconstructed event kinematics, E rec \u03bd and Q 2 rec , distributions of two distinct subsamples of antineutrino charged current coherent pion sample for poin scattered angles less than 35 degrees and more than 35 degrees. As shown in Fig. 7, data in the sample \u03b8 \u03c0 > 35 \u2022 are consistent with background prediction while there  is an enhancement of the data excess in the sample \u03b8 \u03c0 \u2264 35 \u2022 . The same test have been performed in SciBooNE's neutrino charged current coherent pion sample [26], and we found a similar data excess to that seen in antineutrino mode. SciBooNE's antineutrino and neutrino data suggest that pions from charged current coherent pion events tend to be produced more forward than the Rein-Sehgal model employed by the NEUT generator. In order to study charged current coherent pion production, pion kinematics is important as well as muon kinematics.",
