In this report, particleidentification detectors and techniques, as well as achieved performance, are shortly reviewed. The current results on hadron transverse momentum spectra measured in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and 7 TeV, and in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are shown. In particular, proton-proton results on particle production yields, spectral shapes and particle ratios are presented as a function of the collision energy and compared to previous experiments and commonly-used Monte Carlo models. Particle spectra, yields and ratios in Pb-Pb are measured as a function of the collision centrality and the results are compared with published RHIC data in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 0.2 TeV and predictions for the LHC.",

A detailed review of the ALICE experiment and of its PID capabilities can be found in [1]. The ITS is a six-layer silicon detector located at radii between 4 and 43 cm. Four of the six layers provide dE/dx measurements and are used for particle identification in the non-relativistic (1/\u03b2 2 ) region. Moreover, using the ITS as a standalone tracker enables one to reconstruct and identify low-momentum particles (below 200 MeV/c) not reaching the main tracking systems. The TPC is the main central-barrel tracking detector of ALICE and provides threedimensional hit information and specific energy-loss measurements with up to 159 samples. With the measured particle momentum and dE/dx the particle type can be determined by comparing the measurements against the Bethe-Bloch expectation. The TOF detector is a large-area array of Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) and covers the central pseudorapidity region (|\u03b7| < 0.9, full azimuth). Particle identification is performed by matching momentum and trajectory-length measurements performed by the tracking system with the time-of-flight information provided by the TOF system. The total time-of-flight resolution is about 85 ps in Pb-Pb collisions (about 120 ps in pp collisions) and it is determined by the time resolution of the detector itself and by the start-time resolution.",

The contribution from the feed-down of weakly-decaying particles to \u03c0 \u00b1 , p andp and from protons from material are subtracted by fitting the data using Monte Carlo templates of the DCA 1 distributions.

The results of the analysis performed at \u221a s = 7 TeV were reported at this conference [3]. The ratios K/\u03c0 and p/\u03c0 as a function of p T are shown in Figure 1 comparing measurements at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and 7 TeV. Both ratios do not show evident energy dependence and the same holds for the p T -integrated production ratios which are also observed to be rather independent of the collision energy from 0.9 TeV to 7 TeV. Moreover, no difference between p/\u03c0 + andp/\u03c0 \u2212 ratios is observed leading to a constant value of about 0.05 and vanishing baryon/antibaryon asymmetry at LHC as already reported in [4]. The comparison with Monte Carlo generators shows that the p T -dependent K/\u03c0 ratio is underestimated at high p T by recent PYTHIA tunes. The same holds for the p/\u03c0 ratio, though a better agreement with the data is observed for PYTHIA D6T.",

When compared to Monte Carlo event generators, multi-strange baryon production is under-predicted by various PYTHIA tunes, though the most recent Perugia-2011 tune shows an overall better agreement with the data, in particular in the high p T region. \u03c6 resonance production is rather well described by PHOJET whereas in PYTHIA Perugia-2011 it is slightly under-predicted at low p T . It is worth to stress here that an overall good agreement between the data and PYTHIA Perugia-2011 tune is observed for charged-kaons but not for resonance production, as can be deduced from Figure 2. On the other hand there is still some work for tuning model for resonances (especially baryons) and multi-strange baryon production.",

A detailed study of the spectral shapes has been done in order to give a quantitative estimate of the thermal freeze-out temperature spectra has been performed in the p T ranges 0.3-1.0 GeV/c, 0.2-1.5 GeV/c and 0.3-3.0 GeV/c for pions, kaons and protons, respectively. While the T f o parameter is sensitive to the pion fit range because of feed-down of resonances 2 the transverse flow \u03b2 measurement is not, being dominated by the proton spectral shape. The results obtained on the thermal freeze-out properties in different centrality bins are compared with similar measurements performed by the STAR Collaboration at lower energies in Figure 4 (top). A stronger radial flow is observed with respect to RHIC, being about 10% larger in the most central collisions at the LHC. The data are also compared to predictions from hydrodynamic models. As already reported in [11] the pure hydrodynamic prediction [12] cannot reproduce the proton shape. A similar disagreement was observed when comparing proton elliptic flow v 2 to the same model [13]. A new calculation has been performed using a hybrid model which adds a hadronic rescattering and freeze-out stage to the viscous dynamics [14]. These new predictions [15] are compared to the data in Figure 4 (bottom) and the agreement with the proton shape is better than in a pure hydrodynamic picture. This suggests that extra flow builds up in the hadronic phase. The difference in the proton yield can be ascribed to the fact that the model derives yields from a thermal model with T ch = 165 MeV. It is worth to mention that this model also reproduces the shape of elliptic flow of identified particles as reported at this conference [16].",

The measured yields of several particles normalized to the pion yield in 0-5% central collisions are compared to thermal model predictions in Figure 5 (right).

Proton-proton results show no evident \u221a s dependence in hadron production ratios. Monte Carlo generators do not reproduce hadron ratios and multi-strange baryon production yet, though a good agreement between the data and PYTHIA Perugia-2011 is observed for charged kaons. In Pb-Pb collisions thep/\u03c0 \u2212 integrated ratio is significantly lower than statistical model predictions with a chemical freeze-out temperature T ch = 160 \u2212 170 MeV. The average transverse momenta and the spectral shapes indicate a \u223c10% stronger radial flow than at RHIC energies. The comparison with recent hydrodynamic calculations suggests that extra flow builds up in the hadronic phase.",
