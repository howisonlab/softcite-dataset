Electron antineutrinos were identified by inverse \u03b2-decays with the emitted neutron captured by hydrogen, yielding a data-set with principally distinct uncertainties from that with neutrons captured by gadolinium. With the final two of eight antineutrino detectors installed, this study used 621 days of data including the previously reported 217-day data set with six detectors. The dominant statistical uncertainty was reduced by 49%. Intensive studies of the cosmogenic muon-induced 9 Li and fast neutron backgrounds and the neutron-capture energy selection efficiency, resulted in a reduction of the systematic uncertainty by 26%. The deficit in the detected number of antineutrinos at the far detectors relative to the expected number based on the near detectors yielded sin 2 2\u03b813 = 0.071 \u00b1 0.011 in the three-neutrino-oscillation framework. The combination of this result with the gadolinium-capture result is also reported.",

            "text": "Precise measurements of neutrino mixing parameters are crucial to searches for CP-symmetry violation among neutral leptons and tests of neutrino oscillation theory. In particular, the precision of neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 is of key significance in constraining the leptonic CP phase \u03b4 [1][2][3][4]. Prior to 2012, many experimental efforts had been made to determine \u03b8 13 [5][6][7][8][9][10]. The first measurement of \u03b8 13 with a significance greater than five standard deviations was reported by the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in 2012 [11]. The most recent determinations of \u03b8 13 from reactor and accelerator experiments [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] are consistent.",

            "text": "The three reactor antineutrino experiments, Double Chooz [19], RENO [20], and Daya Bay [21], currently provide the most precise measurements of the mixing angle. They use gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator to identify electron antineutrinos through inverse \u03b2-decay (IBD) reactions (\u03bd e + p \u2192 n + e + ) with the neutron capturing on gadolinium (nGd). A surrounding volume of undoped liquid scintillator improves the efficiency of detecting \u03b3's that escape from the doped volume, and has been used (in conjunction with the doped volume) by each of the three reactor experiments to determine sin 2 2\u03b8 13 independently through IBD reactions with the neutron captured by hydrogen (nH) [14,15,22,23]. The KamLAND experiment has used nH IBDs to measure the disappearance of reactor \u03bd e [24] and the flux of geo\u03bd e [25]. The Super-Kamiokande experiment has used nH IBDs to search for relic supernova \u03bd e [26]. Future projects, including the medium-baseline reactor experiments JUNO [27] and RENO-50 [28], and LENA [29], will also make use of nH IBDs. Techniques developed for this analysis may be useful for these future experiments.",

The positron deposited energy within O(1) ns and then annihilated with an electron, usually producing two back-to-back 0.511-MeV \u03b3's (several percent of the positrons annihilated in flight such that the sum of \u03b3 energies was greater than 2 \u00d7 0.511 MeV).

The resolution for a 2.2-MeV \u03b3 was about 12 cm in the r-\u03c6 plane and 13 cm along the z axis, in the LS volume.

Given the data recording window of 1 \u00b5s, coincidence windows were initiated 1 \u00b5s after an event to ensure distinction of prompt and delayed events. Lone events are denoted as \"singles\" and were used to construct accidental background samples (see Section V). Only pairs of events, denoted as double coincidences (DCs), were used to select IBD candidates. If more than two events occurred within [1,400] \u00b5s, they were excluded from further analysis. In addition, if the first, or prompt, event of a DC occurred within [1,400] \u00b5s of a preceding event or muon-veto time window, the DC was excluded (this requirement was also applied to singles). The fraction of DAQ time remaining for IBD analysis after implementing these multiple-coincidence criteria was about 98.4% for each AD, and is reported as \u03b5 m in Table II. This multiplicity selection efficiency was derived as described in Ref. [47], and calculated using the duration of the coincidence time window T c = 399 \u00b5s and the rate of uncorrelated single events R s (which are uncorrelated events that satisfy the criteria of Sections IV.2.1-IV.2.3; not singles, . delayed reconstructed energy after subtracting the total ABS for the far and near halls, respectively, (e) and (f) are the reconstructed positions of all prompt events after subtracting the total ABS for the far and near halls, respectively.

Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of prompt energy vs. delayed energy for all DCs in all near-hall ADs after applying the coincidence-distance criterion. Bands for both the 2.22-MeV nH and 8-MeV nGd delayed events are apparent, with a large background of low-energy DCs around the nH band. The clusters around 1.5 and 2.7 MeV are due to \u03b3's from 40 K and 208 Tl decays, respectively. The bands between these clusters are dominated by the decay products of 238 U. The measured nH \u03b3 energy was around 2.33 MeV, which is offset from the true value of 2.22 MeV because of nonlinear detector response and the calibration of the energy scale with nGd events. The nH delayed events were fit as described in Section VII.3, providing a mean and a standard deviation \u03c3 for each AD. Delayed events were required to have E rec within 3\u03c3 (\u22480.42 MeV) of the mean for each AD, which excludes \u03b3's from 40 K. The accidental background from the remaining decays was effectively removed by the subtraction described in Section V. Backgrounds from correlated events are described in Section VI.

These events were dominantly singles but included DCs and multiple coincidences. The lower limit was derived from the number of singles plus DCs that did not satisfy the coincidence-distance criterion. These DCs were dominantly accidentals. Time-averaged values of R s are listed in Table II for each AD. The difference between the two limits was assigned as the systematic uncertainty of R s and propagated to R Acc , resulting in 0.18%, 0.16% and 0.05% uncertainties of the accidental rate in EH1, EH2, and EH3, respectively. The larger uncertainties for the near halls are due to the higher rates of IBD reactions from reactor antineutrinos, which enlarged the upper limits. Figure 4 shows R s as a function of time for each AD, where a downward trend began after the water shields were filled. During the first few weeks, R s decreased by < 0.05 Hz per day for near-hall ADs and by < 0.08 Hz per day for far-hall ADs. The near-hall water shields were filled earlier and so, the AD rates stabilized earlier. Considering that R s was calculated every 2-3 days, the uncertainty introduced to R Acc by these trends was estimated to be < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in EH3. There were also instantaneous increases of R s , which were caused by muon-generated spallation products such as 9 Li and 8 He (Section VI.1), and spallation neutrons (Section VI.2). From a study of R s vs. time after muon-event vetoes, the impact of these products was estimated to be negligible. Two methods were used to validate the subtraction of the accidental background. The first method used the distribution of distance between the prompt and delayed events, which was dominated by accidental coincidences at large separations. After subtracting the accidental background, the resulting number of correlated DCs with large separations is expected to be zero. Figure 5 shows the distribution of distance between the prompt and delayed events for DCs, accidentals, and correlated DCs. The two upper panels of Fig. 5 contain calculations of the relative difference between the measured number of double coincidences (N DC ) and the predicted number of accidentals (N Acc ), beyond 200 cm. These differences are consistent with zero with respect to their statistical uncertainties. A constant fit in the bottom panel also shows that the distribution of selected nH IBD candidates (N Cor ) beyond 200 cm is consistent with an expected fraction of about 0.05%, which was determined from Monte Carlo simulation. This fraction corresponds to an expected fitted constant of about 0 (3) entries/2 cm for the far (near) hall(s).",

These \u03b2 \u2212neutron decays mimic the prompt and delayed events of IBD reactions.

The temporal relation between 9 Li/ 8 He decays and prior detected muons was used to estimate the collective yield of the 9 Li and 8 He background N Li/He in each hall.

            "text": "To obtain a better estimate of N Li/He , N DC \u00a1 \u00b5 was reduced by suppressing accidentals among the double coincidences. This was done by augmenting the promptenergy criterion from 1.5 < E p < 12.0 MeV to 3.5 < E p < 12.0 MeV. The measured number of 9 Li/ 8 He was corrected with the efficiency of the augmented criterion with respect to the nominal criterion. This ratio was determined to be 74% by averaging measurements from all three halls with visible muon energy E vis \u00b5 > 1 GeV (E vis \u00b5 is the detected energy that was deposited by a muon traversing the detector). The weighted average of the three measurements had a statistical uncertainty of 5%. The systematic uncertainty was estimated as the difference between the average and a Monte Carlo simulation, and therefore accounted for backgrounds in the measurements. The simulation used \u03b2 spectra of 9 Li/ 8 He decays calculated as those in Ref. [50]. The resulting promptenergy spectrum from the simulation is shown in Fig. 11, where it has been normalized to N Li/He . The difference in efficiency between the measurement and simulation was 6%, giving a total uncertainty of 8% for the efficiency of the augmented E p criterion. The 9 Li/ 8 He background was determined for three ranges of E vis \u00b5 : 0.02-1.0 GeV, 1.0-2.5 GeV, and > 2.5 GeV. The highest energy range was defined as such because it identically defines a \u00b5 sh , which was vetoed for 1 s (see Table I) and therefore contributed only O(1)% of the total 9 Li/ 8 He background. The lowest energy range was defined as such because it could not provide a reliable fit of 9 Li/ 8 He due to its higher R \u00b5 and lower signal-to-background ratio: relative to the middle energy range, R \u00b5 was 14 (11) times greater and N Li/He /N DC \u00a1 \u00b5 was about 5 (10) times lower, in EH1 (EH3).",

            "text": "The number of 9 Li/ 8 He for both the middle and lowest energy ranges in EH1 and EH2 were determined with the combined data samples of EH1 and EH2. The energy spectra of muons in EH1 and EH2 are similar [30] such that their yields of 9 Li/ 8 He per muon are expected to agree to O(1)% [51,52]. The E vis \u00b5 spectra of the two near halls were observed to differ in scale by about 7%. This was due to a 7% lower average gain of the highcharge range [53] of the EH2 electronics. After scaling the E vis \u00b5 spectrum of EH2 by 7%, the difference between the near-hall spectra was O(1)% across the two energy ranges. This scaling introduced a negligible uncertainty to the fitted number of 9 Li/ 8 He. The muon rate R \u00b5 of the combined fit was fixed to the DC-weighted average of the measured muon rates in the two near halls. Combining the uncertainties of the measured muon rates (0.3%) and numbers of DCs (1%), the weighted average had a 0.2% uncertainty. This 0.2% uncertainty of R \u00b5 corresponded to a 27% change in the number of 9 Li/ 8 He via Eq. 8for the middle energy range. The 0.2% uncertainty had a negligible impact on the lowest energy range because its muon rate was reduced as described above. The fitted number of 9 Li/ 8 He was divided among the near halls according to their measured muon rates (after scaling EH2) multiplied by their DAQ times.",

The increase of events with decrease of energy in the LS volume is due to the lesser containment of the recoil protons within the LS volume: the protons that recoil from fast neutrons that capture in the LS volume are closer to the boundary of the scintillating region compared to those associated with fast neutrons that capture in the GdLS volume, and thus, are more likely to deposit less energy in scintillator.",

The spectrum was normalized to the extended IBD spectrum from all the ADs in a hall, between 12 and 300 MeV. The systematic uncertainty was estimated using both the OWS-identified and extended IBD spectra. First, the extended IBD spectrum of each hall was fit between 12 and 300 MeV with the power law given in Eq. (9).

The largest relative difference among the three halls (6% in EH3) was assigned to be the systematic uncertainty , and simulation (red points).

During the pause to install the final two ADs in the summer of 2012, two of the three Am-C sources were removed (from ACU-B and -C) from each AD in EH3, reducing this background in EH3 by about 40% relative to the previous analysis [15].",

            "text": "The L/E-dependence of neutrino oscillation [see Eq. 3] implies that the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum changes with baseline L. Therefore, the efficiency of the prompt-energy criterion varies with baseline. The impact of this dependence on the multiple reactor-detector pairs at Daya Bay was estimated by applying oscillation to a predicted reactor antineutrino spectrum as a function of baseline. At each baseline [36], the IBD selection efficiency was determined with simulation samples for the GdLS, LS, and acrylic volumes. The simulation accounted for energy deposited outside the scintillator volumes, and the nonlinearity [12], nonuniformity, and resolution of the detector energy-response. The oscillation parameter values were the same as those in Section III. The resulting variation in the IBD selection efficiency as a function of baseline is illustrated for the LS region in Fig. 12. The shape of the curve is due to the span of the data in the L/E domain. For the near halls (smaller L), more oscillation occurred for lower energy antineutrinos, which decreased the number of IBD reactions with prompt energy below threshold and thus, increased the efficiency. For illustration, the mean energy of a prompt event without oscillation was 3.626 MeV while the corresponding energy in EH1 (EH2) due to antineutrinos from the two (four) nearby reactors with oscillation was 3.630 (3.632) MeV. These numbers are representative of the first 4 (8) points in Fig. 12. For the far hall (larger L), more oscillation occurred at median antineutrino energies and about equally at higher and lower energies, resulting in a net decrease in efficiency. In the fit for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 (Section VIII.2), the IBD selection efficiencies in the GdLS, LS, and acrylic volumes of each AD were multiplied by a correction factor for each reactor baseline (6 reactors \u00d7 8 ADs = 48 baselines) [36]. The fit was first performed without correction factors. The resulting value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 was then used to generate a set of correction factors and then fit again. This iterative approach was tested using Asimov data samples generated according to Eq. (1) with known values of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . Several values of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 were tested and all fits converged consistently with negligible bias. No additional uncertainty was assigned. Although several iterations were performed, the value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 converged within the precision reported in this article after only one iteration. The results of the fits without corrections were about 4% larger than the true values for the Asimov data samples and the converged value for the measured data. This variation of the IBD selection efficiency was estimated to be an order of magnitude smaller for the nGd-IBD analysis, which required E p > 0.7 MeV.",

The capture-time spectrum in LS is due almost solely to nH which can be represented by a single exponential. This is because the number of captures per volume per time, which is proportional to the product of capture cross-section and neutron velocity, is essentially independent of energy below IBD neutron energies. For nGd, this product is much larger at thermal energies than at IBD energies (see, e.g. Ref. [58]), effectively yielding two distinct time constants with \u03c4 0 < \u03c4 Gd . The capture-time constant in LS is denoted by \u03c4 LS , and C 1 and C 2 account for accidentals. The neutron-capture times for the GdLS and LS regions were studied using nGd-and nH-IBDs, respectively. The selection criteria were slightly modified from the nominal IBD criteria: the nGd delayed events were selected between 6 and 10 MeV, while the nH promptenergy lower limit was increased to 3.5 MeV to minimize the accidental background, and the nH delayed-energy criterion was fixed to 1.8-2.8 MeV. When fitting the nGd-IBD spectrum, the reconstructed positions of the prompt events were required to satisfy |z| < 1 m and r < 1 m to minimize the fraction of neutrons that originated from, or had any interactions, outside GdLS. Similarly, when fitting the nH-IBD spectrum, a constraint of r > 1.7 m was applied to minimize the fraction of neutrons that originated from GdLS. The fit results using the data from all ADs are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Good agreement in the slopes is observed between the data and simulation. The fitted capture-time constants were about 28.1 and 216 \u00b5s for the GdLS and LS volumes, respectively. For reference, Fig. 6 shows the total capture-time spectra of the far-and near-hall ADs for the nominal nH-IBD selection criteria before and after subtracting the accidental background.",

One method is a relative comparison of the delayed-energy spectra of the ADs. The comparison was made after applying all the nH selection criteria and subtracting the accidental backgrounds (errors from accidental subtractions were included in the energy spectra). The method uses the number of events within two energy ranges: the first is the nominal selection of \u00b5 \u00b1 3\u03c3, which is approximately [1.90, 2.74] MeV, and the second is [1.50, 2.80] MeV. These two ranges are visible for each AD in Fig. 16. The upper value of the latter range was chosen to include most of the nH IBDs with E d > 2.74 MeV (0.1% of nH IBDs) while the lower value corresponds to the low-energy criterion (Section IV.2.2) and includes more of the tail of the spectrum (12% more nH IBDs). The latter range contains both peak and tail portions of the spectrum and therefore is assumed to be sensitive to all factors that might influence the shape of the spectrum.",

This determination also assumes that variations in the spectrum outside range B are not systematically different from those within. Using simulation, differences in OAV dimensions or in the mean free path of the \u03b3's were found to have a greater impact on the shape of the spectrum at the low-energy end, but to contribute negligibly to \u03b4\u03b5 i /\u03b5 i . In addition, comparing the high-statistics spectra of the near-hall ADs did not reveal any systematic trends in the differences among spectra above 1.5 MeV, suggesting that there may not be any such trends below 1.5 MeV. The statistical uncertainties of the data from the far-hall ADs were large, so they were excluded from the determination though they were conservatively used in the linear fit. Comparing the four near-hall ADs, the half-range of the \u03b4\u03b5 i /\u03b5 i was 0.33%.

The variation of n H was taken to be negligible because of the mixing of all production batches of scintillator [32] and the filling procedures applied to the ADs [59]. As a result, the AD-to-AD variation of the fraction of nH captures was estimated to be < 0.01% and 0.16% in the LS and GdLS volumes, respectively.

The energy spectrum of spallation-nH and -nGd \u03b3's from each AD was obtained by subtracting a background spectrum recorded in a background time window from the spectrum recorded in a signal time window. Spallation neutrons generated by cosmogenic muons were identified as delayed-type events that followed WS-or AD-identified muons. These muons were identified with greater purity by augmenting the definitions of a \u00b5 WS and \u00b5 AD : for both the IWS and OWS, N PMT was required to be > 20, and a \u00b5 AD was required to have E rec > 50 MeV. A 20-\u00b5s muon-event veto-time was applied to avoid the \"ringing\" of PMT signals that followed high-energy events [60]. The signal time window was between 20 and 700 \u00b5s after a muon event. The background time window was a similar length, however, given the different distributions of muon energy and trajectory among halls [30] (which affected the characteristics of the spallation products), the background window was tuned to be slightly different in each hall. By matching both the shape and population of the tail portions of the signal and background energy spectra, the background window was set to be between 700 and 1480, 1453, and 1384 \u00b5s, in EH1, EH2, and EH3, respectively.

Figure 19 shows the difference in the ratio defined by Eq. 21for each near-hall AD relative to the mean of the four ADs. The far-hall ADs were not used due to their lack of statistics. The choice of r \u03b5 is found to have little impact on the variation of the ratio. The half-range of the ratios of the near-hall ADs is approximately 0.35%. Due to the use of a ratio with nGd events, this estimation inherently includes the variation of the nGd delayed-energy criterion, which was estimated to be 0.12% for IBDs [50]. This estimate also inherently includes the variation of the fraction of neutrons that capture on hydrogen.

The first component, which was dominant, does not exist for the nGd-IBD analysis and thus, is uncorrelated. The correlation of energy scale variations between the nH-and nGd-IBD analyses was estimated to be 0.8 with a linear fit of the measured nH-IBD vs. nGd-IBD delayed-energy peaks. The latter component of \"others\" accounts for any contributions not directly evaluated, such as differences in OAV dimensions or the residual nonuniformity of E rec , and was assumed to be fully correlated. The hydrogen capture fractions of the nH analysis were determined to be anticorrelated with the gadolinium capture fraction of the nGd analysis: in the GdLS volume, if the fraction of captures on Gd increases, then naturally the fraction on H decreases. In the LS volume, the same anticorrelated relation exists via neutrons that are produced in GdLS or LS but capture in the other of the two volumes.

However, a few percent of the IBD positrons annihilated in-flight, producing a higher-energy \u03b3 that was sometimes directed toward the scintillator with enough energy to pass the low-energy criterion. Some fraction of the corresponding IBD neutrons propagated to the LS and captured on H. From simulation, it was estimated that approximately 0.06% of the IBDs in the MO survived the selection criteria. This \"spill-in\" effect from the MO was found to have a negligible impact on the determination of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and was not included in this analysis.",

The levels of GdLS and LS in the overflow tanks [61] (see Fig. 1) of EH3-AD1 slowly decreased while the level of MO slowly increased, suggesting that the LS was leaking into the MO region. This hypothesis was supported by measurements using the MO clarity system [35] which showed significant decreases in the transmission of shorter-wavelength light through the MO and an increase of MO light yield over time, consistent with a gradual addition of scintillator into the MO. The hypothesis was further supported by the observation of an increased (decreased) rate of higherenergy (lower-energy) muons reconstructed in the MO volume. These observed trends stabilized after about two years with an estimated leakage of about 20 kg. This loss of mass lowered the height of the LS level in the overflow tank and did not directly impact the number of target protons in the LS volume.",

Given a 20-kg leakage into the 36-ton volume, and assuming the light yield of the LS is two orders of magnitude greater than that of the MO, one may naively estimate an average increase of the light yield in the MO volume on the order of 1%. In simulation, this increase was modeled as an increase in the energy scale, and was applied to prompt and delayed events of IBDs generated in the MO, resulting in a O(0.001)% increase of the nH-IBD selection efficiency. Indeed, no impact of the leak to the nH-IBD analysis has been observed in comparisons of various quantities before and after the start of the leak. These quantities included various event rates, neutroncapture energy peak and resolution, and IBD prompt and delayed event-position distributions. Given the observed stabilization of the leak, no impact is expected in the future.",

The ADuncorrelated uncertainties of these efficiencies are listed for each detector volume v in Table III. The uncertainty of the delayed-energy selection efficiency reduced from 0.5% [15] to 0.35% because of a new estimation and an update of the original estimation to scale the number of spallation neutrons with the number of target protons. This reduced the uncertainty of the nH-IBD selection efficiency by 15%. Table III also gives the estimated correlation coefficients between the detector efficiencies of the nH-and nGd-IBD analyses. The number of target protons were fully correlated in the GdLS while uncorrelated in the LS due to their identical and independent methods of mass measurement, respectively. The efficiency of the promptenergy criterion was correlated through a common dependence on energy scale, and was conservatively treated as fully correlated. The coincidence-time criterion was also treated as fully correlated. The delayed-energy criterion was largely independent because the primary contribution to the uncertainty in the nH analysis was the variation of the 3\u03c3 selection, which does not exist in the nGd analysis. The coincidence-distance criterion was uncorrelated because there was no such selection in the nGd-IBD analysis. The overall correlation between the IBD detection efficiencies of the nH-and nGd-IBD analyses was about 0.07.",

In addition, improved precision will be achieved with a spectral analysis of the prompt-energy spectrum, which is underway. This will also provide a new determination of the mass-squared difference \u2206m 2 32 . The analysis of nH-IBDs has helped to maximize the fiducial volume of the ADs to supernova neutrinos [63]. It should also provide an opportunity to reduce the dominant uncertainty of detection efficiency in the measurement of reactor antineutrino flux [44], given the lesser sensitivity of the nH-IBD analysis to neutron spill-in/out effects. Furthermore, the data-driven techniques developed to study the accidental background and the IBD selection criteria may be useful for other experiments that use or plan to use nH-IBDs, such as JUNO [27], RENO-50 [28], and LENA [29].",

The uncertainty is reduced by 40% compared with the previous nH-IBD result primarily because of the factor of 3.6 increase in statistics, but also because of the 15% and 30% reductions in the uncertainties of the IBD selection efficiency and backgrounds, respectively. The new result is consistent with that from the nGd-IBD analysis from Daya Bay, providing a valuable confirmation of the nGd-IBD result. Combining the nH-and nGd-IBD results provides a new improved determination of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.082 \u00b1 0.004.",
