This search is sensitive to VBF production of additional heavy bosons that may decay into Higgs boson pairs, and in a non-resonant topology it can constrain the quartic coupling between the Higgs bosons and vector bosons. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model expectation is observed, and limits on the production cross-section are set at the 95% confidence level for a heavy scalar resonance in the context of an extended Higgs sector, and for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Interpretation in terms of the coupling between a Higgs boson pair and two vector bosons is also provided: coupling values normalised to the Standard Model expectation of \u03ba 2V < \u22120.76 and \u03ba 2V > 2.90 are excluded at the 95% confidence level in data.",

            "text": "The Higgs boson (H) was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in 2012 [1,2] using proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The measured properties have so far been found to be in agreement with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. The production of a pair of Higgs bosons (HH) is a rare process in the SM with a cross-section about 1000 times smaller than the single Higgs boson production cross-section, but various theories beyond the SM (BSM) predict cross-sections for HH production that are significantly higher than the SM prediction. Spin-0 resonances, with narrow or broad width, that decay into Higgs boson pairs, appear in BSM scenarios [3,4]. Enhanced non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is predicted by many models, for example those featuring light coloured scalars [5] or new contact interactions, such as direct ttHH vertices [6,7]. Previous searches for Higgs boson pair production in the bbbb channel were carried out in the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) production mode by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [8][9][10][11][12], and limits were set for resonant and non-resonant production. Statistical combinations of search results for HH in various decay channels were also performed by the two experiments [13,14], profiting from the sensitivity of several final states.",

            "text": "This paper focuses on searches for Higgs boson pair production via vector-boson fusion (VBF), through diagrams such as those presented in figure 1, and using the dominant H \u2192 bb decay mode [15]. The VBF process (pp \u2192 HHjj) is characterised by the presence of two jets (j) with a large rapidity gap resulting from quarks from which a vector boson (V ) is radiated. In the SM, three different types of couplings are involved in HH production via VBF: the Higgs boson self-coupling (HHH), the Higgs-boson-vector-boson coupling (V V H) and the quartic (di-vector-boson-di-Higgs-boson, or V V HH) coupling. The coupling modifiers \u03ba \u03bb , \u03ba V and \u03ba 2V control the strength of the HHH, V V H and V V HH couplings with respect to the SM value, respectively, and are normalised so that they are equal 1 in the SM. A deviation of these coupling modifiers from their SM expectations could lead to enhanced HH production. While searches in the ggF mode are more sensitive to deviations in \u03ba \u03bb , the VBF topology has unique sensitivity to \u03ba 2V [15] because the ggF mode does not involve the V V HH interaction. For resonant production, two classes of signals are tested to perform a generic inclusive search for resonances with masses m X in the range 260-1000 GeV. The first signal class is representative of a broad resonance with width typically 10-20% of the signal mass; it corresponds to a heavy scalar of the 2HDM Type II model [16] and is obtained by setting the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets tan(\u03b2) = 2.0 and sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0.6, where \u03b1 is the mixing angle between the two CP-even Higgs bosons. The second class features a narrow resonance with a fixed width of 4 MeV.",

Clusters are calibrated at the EM scale [57] and their energy is corrected for additional energy deposits from pile-up interactions using an area-based correction [58]. Subsequently, calibration using p T -and \u03b7-dependent factors derived from simulation is applied, followed by the global sequential calibration [57]. The latter reduces the flavour dependence of the calibration and energy leakage effects. The final calibration is based on in situ measurements in collision data [57]. To preferentially reject jets originating from pile-up interactions, a multivariate classification algorithm (jet vertex tagger) based on tracking information [59] is used for jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. The selected working point provides an inclusive hard-scatter process efficiency of about 97% in that kinematic region. The efficiency in the simulation is corrected to match that measured in data. Events having jets consistent with noise in the calorimeter or non-collision backgrounds are vetoed [57].",

Studies show that the ratio, which appears to be constant, can be sufficiently well described by a straight-line fit, and that the change in the result is marginal for other splitting points. The +1\u03c3 variation of the slope of the fitted line and the +1\u03c3 variation of the fitted line with inverted slope are used as up and down variations of the uncertainty in the background shape.
