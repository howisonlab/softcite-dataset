In this discussion I see too much theoretical desperation caused by the so far unsuccessful hunt for what is beyond the Standard Model, and too little of the necessary interaction of the accelerator, experimenter, and theory communities necessary for a scientific and engineering success. Here, I give my impressions of the problem, its possible solution, and what is needed to have both a scientifically productive and financially viable future.",

I think I may be the last still around of the first generation of pioneers that brought colliding beam machines to reality. I have been personally involved in building and using such machines since 1957 when I became part of the very small group that started to build the first of the colliders 2 . While the decisions on what to do next belong to the younger generation, the perspective of one of the old guys might be useful. I see too little effort going into long range accelerator R&D, and too little interaction of the three communities needed to choose the next step, the theorists, the experimenters, and the accelerator people. Without some transformational developments to reduce the cost of the machines of the future, there is a danger that we will price ourselves out of the market. To be published in Review of Accel.

He too was interested in proton-proton collisions at very high center-of-mass energies, and he introduced the notion of the accelerator-storage ring complex. Beams would be accelerated to some high energy in a synchrotron and then transferred into two storage rings with a common straight section where the beams would interact. Since the beams at high energy need much less space in an accelerator vacuum chamber than is required for beams at injection, the high-energy storage rings would have smaller-cross-section magnets and vacuum chambers, thus adding little to the cost of the complex, but at the same time enormously increasing the scientific potential. He also observed, \"The use of storage rings on electron synchrotrons in the GeV range would allow the measurement of the electron-electron interaction at center-of-mass energies of about 100 times as great as are now available. The natural beam damping in such machines might make beam capture somewhat easier than in the case of protons.\" That observation had a profound effect on O'Neill's career and mine, as well as on particle physics.",

Indeed, O'Neill's original idea of using a scattering foil for injection was soon proved to be impossible. On the other hand, injection and beam stacking in an electron storage ring looked easy because of synchrotron-radiation damping. An electron beam could be injected off-axis into a storage ring and would perform betatron oscillations around the equilibrium orbit. These oscillations would decrease exponentially over time in a properly designed magnet lattice because of the emission of synchrotron radiation while the energy loss is compensated with RF acceleration. When these oscillations had damped sufficiently, another bunch could be injected into the storage ring and would damp down on top of the first one. Since phase-space was not conserved in the presence of radiation, there was, in principle, no stacking problem. Thus, the collider story began with electron machines because they were much easier to inject into, were smaller, and were much less expensive than the proton machines that were the dream of those who first began the move toward colliders.",

The LEP tunnel was only roughly one-third the circumference of the SSC tunnel, but that could be partly made up for with higher field superconducting magnets (eventually the LHC magnets ran at about 30% higher field than the design field of the SSC).",

Regrettably, there has been little talk so far among the three communities, experimenters, theorists, and accelerator scientists, on what constraints on the next generation are imposed by the requirement that the experiments actually produce analyzable data. I will give an example of an LHC-like 100-TeV machine (LHC-100) to show some of the design problems. The most important choice for a new, higher energy collider is its luminosity, which determines its discovery potential. If a new facility is to have the same potential for discovery of any kind of new particles as had the old one, the new luminosity required is very roughly proportional to the square of the energy because cross sections typically drop as E -2 . A seven-fold increase in energy from that of HL-LHC to a 100-TeV collider therefore requires a fifty-fold increase in luminosity. If the luminosity is not increased, save money by building a lower-energy machine where the discovery potential matches the luminosity.",

Examples are new gauge bosons like a Z', or Gluino where particles with masses up to 30-TeV for the weak boson, or 10-TeV -15-TeV for the Gluino could be found (if any were there). Of course, restricting the luminosity to what will be achieved at HL-LHC gives the new machine a limited vision, and will (and should) seriously lower the likelihood that it will be funded 6 . Table 1 below gives key parameters for my examples scaling up to both high luminosity and energy from HL-LHC (24 July, 2014 parameter list) with two versions of the LHC-100, one with 8-tesla magnets and the other with 16-tesla magnets (16 tesla can be gotten with niobium-tin conductor or with high-Tc magnets and that choice has big implications for the cryogenic system that I will not go into here).

While synchrotron radiation made it easy to inject into an electron collider, it made it much more expensive to go to very high energy. The problem was that the minimum-cost machine increases in circumference and cost as the square of the energy. 8 I used to use a slide based on a scale-up of the 100-GeV I started thinking about an alternative, and in 1978 at an accelerator conference at Fermilab I found that A. N. Skrinsky (Novosibirsk), M. Tigner (Cornell), and I had been thinking about the same issue. 9 We worked out the limitations (primarily from the very strong beam-beam interaction that came to be called beamstrahlung), and when I returned to SLAC began the design of a system to test the concept that used only one existing linac and so would be affordable. Both electron and positron bunches would be accelerated in the same pulse of the SLAC linac, and brought them into collision using a system of magnets. The entire thing was shaped something like a tennis racquet in which both electron and positron bunches would be accelerated in the same linac pulse, split at the end of the linac and send each on its way to the collision point around the head of the racquet. An imaginative Department of Energy invented a budget category they called an R&D construction project to fund it.

The Reference Design Report with cost estimate was delivered in 2007. In 2007 U.S. dollars the cost was estimated to be $6.6 billion including site specific costs, plus 24 million person hours of labor. Accounting was of the kind used in Europe and Japan where only the costs of contracts is normally included. U.S. practice includes much more such as R&D before and during construction, detectors, escalation, contingency, and all labor including that at the laboratories where the work was to be done and managed. Typically this increases costs over the accounting method used at the ILC by a factor of 2.5 to 3, resulting in a cost estimate of $16 to $20 billion for the project in U.S. terms. This was about the inflation-adjusted cost estimate for the SSC when it was canceled in 1993. Further, in 2008 the financial crash made it even more unlikely that a project that large would be funded even as an international effort. Work on the ILC slowed dramatically.",

The scientific advances would come from precision measurement of Higgs branching fractions. The standard model Higgs couples to leptons proportional to the square of their masses. Deviations from the standard predictions give clues to what might be waiting to be discovered through internal loop diagrams if masses are above what can be seen in Higgs decays, or even directly if the mass of something new is low enough (not likely since if so, it should have been found at the LHC).",

The problem will be backgrounds as well as statistics. If the theorists really need 1% branching fraction, do not go ahead until the experimenters say if it can be done to that precision in the real world of many open channels and only a relatively small Higgs production.

There is a low transverse momentum fizz that is confined to small angle, but the interesting events are much easier to get at.

The last 40 years of effort has not removed even one of those Post-it notes. The accelerator builders and the experimenters have built ever bigger machines and detectors, while the theorists have kept inventing extensions to the model. If you have seen the movie Particle Fever about the discovery of the Higgs boson, you have heard the theorists saying that the only choices today are between Super-symmetry and the Landscape. Don't believe them. Super-symmetry says that every fermion has a boson partner and vice versa. That potentially introduces a huge number of new arbitrary constants which does not seem like much progress to me. However, in its simpler variants the number of new constants is small and a problem at high energy is solved. But, experiments at the LHC already seem to have ruled out the simplest variants.",

There are two problems with the landscape idea. The first is a logic one. You cannot prove a negative, so you cannot say that there is no more to learn. The second is practical.

Today it is nearly impossible for an experimenter to do what many of yesterday's experimenters could do, build apparatus while doing their own calculations on the significance of what they were working on. Nonetheless, it is necessary for experimenters and accelerator physicists to have some understanding of where theory is, and where it is going.

ITER was to be built with the nations involved contributing components that each country committed to build.

At the time the highest energy proton accelerators were the 3.3-GeV Cosmotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the 6.2-GeV Bevatron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It seemed as if new baryon and meson states were being discovered almost as fast as data could be collected and analyzed, and both Brookhaven and CERN were discussing building accelerators with an energy of about 25 GeV. Kerst wrote that it might be possible to go far beyond those energies with a new accelerator technology, pointing out that making the beams from two 21.6-GeV accelerators collide head-on would give a center-of-mass energy equivalent to that of one accelerator of 1000 GeV colliding with a proton fixed target.",
