The relative phase between two amplitudes, direct decay and decay after mixing, gives rise to time-dependent CP violation. The decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 is considered the golden mode for measuring this type of CP violation in the B 0 s system. In the Standard Model, the CP violating phase in this decay is predicted to be \u03c6 s \u2248 \u22122\u03b2 s , where",

Figure 1 shows the time dependent raw asymmetry of B 0 and B 0 decaying into J/\u03c8 K 0 S , the amplitude of which is proportional to S. Finally, we perform [10] an untagged angular analysis of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decays. This gives access to the decay amplitudes for both final states, as well as the lifetime and lifetime difference \u2206\u0393 s for B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 . Due to the forward geometry of the LHCb detector, the reconstruction efficiency for these decays is a non-trivial function 1    of the fits. In the limit of infinite statistics and perfectly calibrated tagging performance and proper time resolution we expect A to be zero for all m s values but the true one. For the fit with the true m s value the amplitude is expected to be exactly one. Figure 8 shows (A, A ) as a function of m s . We find A = 1.41 \u00b1 0.26 for m s = 17.63 ps 1 , which is 1.6 away from the expected value of 1. This indicates that either our proper time resolution or tagging performance estimate is slightly too pessimistic or that we observe a statistical fluctuation. The separation of A = 1.41 and A = 0 is 5.4 (statistical uncertainties only). This number gives the separation between the hypothesis of a mixing frequency of m s = 17.63 ps 1 and no mixing.   of the decay angles. Then we add [11] the flavor tagging information to the measurement. In the 36 pb \u22121 of 2010 we find approximately 760 B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 events. We extract constraints on \u03c6 s through a maximum likelihood fit to the decay time distribution, the B 0 s invariant mass, and three decay angles. The data sample is too small to allow for meaningful point estimates. Instead we perform a Feldman-Cousins analysis which gives contours in the \u2206\u0393 s \u2212 \u03c6 s plane ( Figure 2) that have frequentist coverage. We observe a deviation from the Standard Model of 1.2\u03c3 , and constrain \u03c6 s \u2208 [\u22122.7, \u22120.5] rad at the 68.3% confidence level.",
