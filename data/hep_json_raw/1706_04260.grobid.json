Two final states are analyzed, one containing a single electron, or muon, and missing transverse momentum, and the other containing multiple jets and no electrons or muons. No evidence is found for a right-handed W boson (W R ) and the combined analyses exclude at 95% confidence level W R with masses below 2.4 TeV if M W R M \u03bd R (mass of the right-handed neutrino), and below 2.6 TeV if M W R < M \u03bd R . The results provide the most stringent limits for right-handed W bosons in the top and bottom quark decay channel.",

            "text": "Many theories that extend the standard model (SM) predict additional charged gauge bosons [1][2][3][4][5], often referred to as W bosons. In models where the resonance is sufficiently massive, it is common to postulate that the coupling to third generation quarks might be enhanced relative to the second and first generations [6,7], making a search for the decay W \u2192 tb or tb highly appropriate. A particular advantage of this kind of search is that this channel is more easily distinguished from the large continuum of multijet background than -1 -JHEP08(2017)029 searches in the decays to light quarks (W \u2192 qq). The search in top and bottom quark (tb) systems complements searches in W \u2192 \u03bd (where denotes a charged lepton and \u03bd denotes a neutrino) and W \u2192 VV (where V denotes an SM W or Z boson) channels. The tb final state also benefits from the fact that its W mass can be fully determined, whereas in the leptonic mode there is a two-fold ambiguity in its mass.",

In scenarios where a theoretical right-handed neutrino (\u03bd R ) is heavier than the W R , the decay W R \u2192 \u03bd R is forbidden and the branching fraction B(W R \u2192 tb) is enhanced. This makes the W R \u2192 tb decay an important channel in the search for W bosons. Previous searches in the tb channel have been performed at the Fermilab Tevatron [8][9][10] and at the CERN LHC by both the CMS [11,12] and ATLAS [13,14] Collaborations. The most stringent limits to date on the production of W bosons with purely right-handed couplings come from the CMS search performed at \u221a s = 8 TeV [12]. Relative to this 8 TeV search, the expected production cross section of the W R boson at \u221a s = 13 TeV is enhanced by a factor of approximately 7 (13) for a 2 3TeV resonance.",

In the leptonic channel, the tb invariant mass is reconstructed from the charged lepton, p miss T , and two jets in the event. The x-and y-components of neutrino p T are determined from JHEP08(2017)029 p miss T and the z-component is calculated by constraining the invariant mass of the lepton and neutrino to the mass of the W boson. This leads to a quadratic equation in p \u03bd z . When the two solutions are real numbers, both are used to reconstruct W boson candidates. If both solutions contain imaginary parts, we set p \u03bd z to the real part of the solutions, and recompute p \u03bd T , which yields a different quadratic ambiguity. In the latter case, we use only the solution with mass closest to 80.4 GeV. Once we have all components of the neutrino momentum, we combine the viable neutrino momentum solutions with the charged lepton momentum to create W boson candidates. We then reconstruct the top quark by combining the four-momenta of each of the W boson candidates with each jet with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Whichever jet yields a top quark candidate mass closest to 172.5 GeV is labeled as the \"best jet\" and is used to reconstruct the top quark candidate. In the case of two W candidates, we use the candidate that yields the top quark mass closest to its nominal value of 172.5 GeV.
