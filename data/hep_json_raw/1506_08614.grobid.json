The tau lepton is identified in the decay mode \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc \u2212\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd \u03c4 . The semitauonic decay is sensitive to contributions from non-standard-model particles that preferentially couple to the third generation of fermions, in particular, Higgs-like charged scalars. A multidimensional fit to kinematic distributions of the candidateB 0 decays gives R\u00f0D \u00c3 \u00de \u00bc 0.336 AE 0.027\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.030\u00f0syst\u00de. This result, which is the first measurement of this quantity at a hadron collider, is 2.1 standard deviations larger than the value expected from lepton universality in the standard model.",

Hints of lepton nonuniversal effects in B \u00fe \u2192 K \u00fe e \u00fe e \u2212 and B \u00fe \u2192 K \u00fe \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 decays [1] have been seen, but no definitive observation of a deviation has yet been made. However, a large class of models that extend the SM contain additional interactions involving enhanced couplings to the third generation that would violate this principle. Semileptonic decays of b hadrons (particles containing a b quark) to third generation leptons provide a sensitive probe for such effects. In particular, the presence of additional charged Higgs bosons, which are often required in these models, can have a significant effect on the rate of the semitauonic decayB 0 \u2192 D \u00c3\u00fe \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 [2]. The use of charge-conjugate modes is implied throughout this Letter.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [12], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [13] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV=c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV=c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [14]. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [15]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [16], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The muon candidate is required to be consistent with a muon signature in the detector, to have momentum 3 < p < 100 GeV=c, to be significantly separated from the primary vertex, and to form a good vertex with the D 0 candidate. The D \u00c3\u00fe \u03bc \u2212 combinations are required to have an invariant mass less than 5280 MeV=c 2 and their momentum vector must point approximately to one of the reconstructed PV locations, which removes combinatoric candidates while preserving a large fraction of semileptonic decays. In addition to the signal candidates, two independent samples of \"wrong sign\" candidates, D \u00c3\u00fe \u03bc \u00fe and D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 , are formed for estimating the combinatorial background. The former represents random combinations of D \u00c3\u00fe candidates with muons from unrelated decays, and the latter is used to model the contribution of misreconstructed D \u00c3\u00fe decays. Mass regions 5280 < m\u00f0D \u00c3\u00fe \u03bc \u2212 \u00de < 10000 MeV=c 2 and 139 < \u0394m < 160 MeV=c 2 are included in all samples for study of the combinatorial backgrounds. Finally, a sample of candidates is selected where the track paired with the D \u00c3\u00fe fails all muon identification requirements. These D \u00c3\u00fe h AE candidates are used to model the background from hadrons misidentified as muons.",

The uncertainty in extracting R\u00f0D \u00c3 \u00de from the fit (model uncertainty) is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the simulated samples; this contribution is estimated via the reduction in the fit uncertainty when the sample statistical uncertainty is not considered in the likelihood. The systematic uncertainty from the kinematic shapes of the background from hadrons misidentified as muons is taken to be half the difference in R\u00f0D \u00c3 \u00de using the two unfolding methods. Form factor parameters are included in the likelihood as nuisance parameters, and represent a source of systematic uncertainty. The total uncertainty on R\u00f0D \u00c3 \u00de estimated from the fit therefore incorporates these sources. To separate the statistical uncertainty and the contribution of the form factor uncertainty, the fit is repeated with form factor parameters fixed to their best-fit values, and the reduction in uncertainty is used to determine the contribution from the form factor uncertainties.

The efficiency of the hardware triggers obtained in simulation differs between magnet polarities and between Pythia versions-the midpoint of the predictions is taken as the nominal value and the range of variation is taken as a systematic uncertainty on the efficiency ratio. Particle identification efficiencies are applied to simulation based on binned J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe control samples, which introduces a systematic uncertainty that is estimated by binning the control samples differently and by comparing to simulated particle identification. The signal and normalization form factors alter the expected ratio of detector acceptances, and 1\u03c3 variations in these with respect to the world averages are used to assign a systematic uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty in the current world average value of B\u00f0\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc \u2212\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd \u03c4 \u00de contributes a small normalization uncertainty.

The measured value is in good agreement with previous measurements at BABAR and Belle [3,5] and is 2.1 standard deviations greater than the SM expectation of 0.252 AE 0.003 [8]. This is the first measurement of any decay of a b hadron into a final state with tau leptons at a hadron collider, and the techniques demonstrated in this Letter open the possibility to study a broad range of similar b hadron decay modes with multiple missing particles in hadron collisions in the future.",
