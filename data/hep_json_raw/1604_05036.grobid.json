The technique uses the fact that at sufficiently high energy a B meson or baryon can live long enough to traverse the inner layers of pixel detectors such as those in the ATLAS, ALICE, or CMS experiments prior to decay. By first defining a \"jet\" via the calorimeter, and then counting hits within that jet between pixel layers at increasing radii, we show it is possible to identify jets that contain b-quarks by detecting a jump in the number of hits without tracking requirements. We show that the technique maintains fiducial efficiency at TeV scale B hadron energies, far beyond the range of existing algorithms, and improves upon conventional b-taggers.",

Two effects in particular make b-tagging in TeV-scale jets difficult: First, more tracks are collimated into a small angle, resulting in a higher hit density and a more ambiguous association of hits with tracks. A single mis-assignment can steer a track off-course and produce an erroneous impact parameter. Second, at extreme energies, an increasing fraction of B hadrons will decay after crossing the innermost layers of the silicon detector: in the best case scenario, this situation merely reduces the number of hits available for reconstruction and thus degrades the impact parameter resolution of the track. A worse scenario is that the track picks up a spurious hit in the densely populated inner layer.",

Setting the tag threshold F appropriately should then reduce the algorithm's sensitivity to showering. The idea of using a multiplicity jump as a method for tagging b-jets is not new. Early bottom and charm fixed target experiments attempted a similar method using multiple planes of scintillators or Cherenkov radiation detectors [9]. The integrated signal from an upstream scintillator was compared to that from a matched downstream scintillator, and a \"jump\" in signal provided the heavy flavour tag. Such methods faced challenges due to large fluctuations in the energy deposited by relativistic particles.

High-energy b-jets and those with lighter quarks were generated by creating Z bosons with masses of 2.5 and 5 TeV. The Z bosons were forced to decay to qq pairs, where q is any quark but t, and hadronization and fragmentation handled by Pythia. Initial and final state radiation resulted in jets with a range of momenta mostly below M Z /2.

In order to model inactive material such as the support structure, mountings, cooling pipes, and electronics, we added further cylinders of silicon to the Geant4 model, located just outside each cylinder of sensitive pixels, so as to bring the total simulated material up to an equivalent of 2.5% of radiation length per layer. In addition a silicon cylinder half as thick was added just inside the outermost active layer of pixels. Figure 2(right) shows the non-zero energy deposition in all pixels for 5000 events modelled in Geant4. The broad peak around 0.1 MeV corresponds to a minimum ionizing particle at roughly normal incidence, the broadness is partly a result of the long tail in the charged particle energy loss distribution. The sharp peak just above 0.02 MeV originates from low energy particles curling within the magnetic field, traversing the 50 \u00b5m width of the pixel. The peak near zero energy corresponds to low energy products of interactions within pixels propagating partially into neighboring pixels. Since we are concerned with particles which are energetic enough to be mostly normally incident, we impose a threshold of 0.05 MeV (well above the ATLAS threshold of 0.011 MeV [16]) before we register the pixel as having been \"hit\".

Figure 3 shows the fiducial b-jet and light-quark efficiencies on the basis of the inner two layers (f 1 ), the middle layers (f 2 ), and the outer two layers (f 3 ) by themselves. b and q differ significantly for thresholds F above zero in all three variables. It is clear that the difference between the efficiencies is larger in f 2 and f 3 than in f 1 , a consequence of the double-length pixels in the innermost layer merging hits. Figure 3 also shows a significance-like figure of merit S \u2261 b /2 \u221a q which we use to find an optimal threshold for B hadron decays in the fiducial region. The absolute value of S is unimportant; the factor of 2 in the denominator is for presentation purposes, so as to fit S on the same plot with the efficiencies. In each case, S rises as F increases above zero, but then falls as the threshold begins to eliminate too much signal. The peak in S is prominent in f 2 and f 3 , but less so in f 1 , reflecting the smaller efficiency difference in the inner two layers. In all cases, however, a threshold of F = 1.0 is close to maximal S while keeping high efficiency. Figure 4(top) shows the efficiencies and S using the whole pixel volume, i.e. with the fiducial region extending from the innermost to outermost layers. A threshold of F = 1 achieves maximal S. We note that because of the different fiducial region, S in figure 4 cannot be compared with those in figure 3. On the other hand, it is interesting to examine the effect of the larger pixels in layer 1: Figure 4(bottom) shows the efficiencies and S using the whole pixel volume, but tagging only with the multiplicity jumps of f 2 and f 3 . The figure of merit S decreases only slightly, suggesting that layer 1 adds little information overall, though maximal S is achieved at lower F and thus higher efficiency.",

Simulation tests have already revealed that a non-uniform pixel size when compared to the other pixel layers may require further refinements, such as differing weights for  hits in different layers, or dynamically altering the cone used to collect hits based on jet energy. A neural net might be able to improve the discrimination power of this technique and potentially increase the difference between the B hadron efficiency and the percentage of uds jets kept. As a further interesting note, when the jet energies are as high as 4 or 5 TeV, there is a significant probability that the B hadron will survive even beyond the final silicon layer used in this study, so the possibility of including silicon strip tracker layers, which are at even larger radii, within this technique is worth exploring. The prospect of tracking charged B mesons and B baryons in the detectors prior to their decay has also not escaped our notice.",
