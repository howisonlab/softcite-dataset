The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.2 fb \u22121 . The cross section is measured for events with two identified b-jets with a transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and a minimum separation in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane of R = 0.4. At least one of the jets in the event is required to have p T > 270 GeV. The cross section is measured differentially as a function of dijet invariant mass, dijet transverse momentum, boost of the dijet system, and the rapidity difference, azimuthal angle and angular distance between the b-jets. The results are compared to different predictions of leading order and next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics matrix elements supplemented with models for parton-showers and hadronization.",

            "text": "The lowest-order Feynman diagrams for bb production are shown in Fig. 1. They define different production mechanisms which are useful in understanding the behaviour of the bb system. In flavour creation (FCR) both b-jets originate from the hard scatter: these jets tend to be the hardest in the event and are predicted to have an approximate back-toback configuration in the transverse plane. The gluon splitting (GSP) production mechanism creates a pair of b-jets that are expected to have a small angular separation. The topology of flavour excitation (FEX) is less distinctive, but it tends to contain an additional parton, which reduces the angular separation between the b-jets. The requirement of a minimum transverse momentum ( p T ) of 270 GeV for the leading jet applied in this analysis enhances the three-jet production Different regions of the bb phase space are probed via the six differential cross sections presented in this article. For large values of the dijet invariant-mass, m bb , the flavour creation mechanism is expected to dominate, leading to final states with well-separated hard jets. Events produced via gluon splitting or flavour excitation are concentrated at small m bb . The opposite is expected for the p T 1 of the dijet system, p T,bb , where the higherp T,bb regions are dominated by gluon-splitting production, and only the lower values of p T,bb have significant contributions from events produced via flavour creation. The azimuthal angle between two bjets, \u03c6, separates the different production mechanisms more evenly. The angular distance between the two b-jets, R = ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 , is a variable often used in analyses reconstructing heavy objects decaying into two b-jets. The other two observables are the rapidity difference between the two b-jets, y * = 1 2 |y 1 \u2212 y 2 |, where y i is the rapidity of b-jet i, and the boost of the dijet system, y B = 1 2 |y 1 + y 2 |. The latter is related to the momentum of the initial-state partons involved in the hard scatter and it is therefore sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDFs).",

At particle level, jets are constructed using all particles, including muons and neutrinos, as input. Particlelevel jets are required to pass the same kinematic selections as jets reconstructed in the calorimeter. The detector effects are corrected by using an unfolding matrix, which maps the event migrations in a binned distribution from detector level to particle level. The data are unfolded using the unfolding matrix and then compared to the predicted particle-level distribution. The iterative part of the unfolding allows the matrix to be modified to account for mismodelling of the MC simulation. Any statistically significant differences between the data and simulation are assumed to originate from processes not included in the simulation and are added into the unfolding matrix. The data are then unfolded using the modified unfolding matrix and the process is repeated until no ele- ment in the unfolding matrix is modified by more than one percent. To cross-check the unfolding results, the unfolding is done with a bin-by-bin method and compared. The binby-bin method takes the ratio of the detector-level jet and particle-level jet distributions, combining all the necessary corrections into a single factor. It treats each bin as an independent measurement, behaving as if events appear or disappear within the bin rather than moving to another. The ratio of IDS to bin-by-bin results is about 2%, except for the mass and the p T , where differences up to 10% were observed. The unfolding matrix is derived from simulated Pythia 6.4 dijet events, and is defined for events that have both the particle-level and the detector-level jet pairs within the fiducial acceptance of the analysis. Fiducial and efficiency correction factors are applied to the data before and after the unfolding, respectively. The fiducial correction, applied before the unfolding, accounts for the effects that cause a detector-level jet pair not to be matched to a particle-level jet pair. The primary reason for the mismatch is that one of the particle-level jets has a p T below the event selection threshold and so is rejected by the analysis. The efficiency corrections, applied after the unfolding, correct primarily for particle-level jets which meet the event selection criteria but are measured outside of the fiducial range at detector level.",

Sherpa is capable of generating multiple partons in its matrix elements, and was also used to generate bb using a LO 2\u21923 matrix elements for this prediction. As Pythia 6.4 is a LO generator, it is not expected to provide an accurate normalisation. The Pythia 6.4 distributions are normalised to the integrated cross section measured in data by applying a factor of 0.61. Sherpa is found to produce the correct cross-section normalisation. Powheg+Pythia 6.4 is chosen as the base-line to examine the theoretical uncertainties. The largest theoretical uncertainties derive from the PDF uncertainties and uncertainties due to missing higher orders. By varying the renormalisation scale, \u03bc R , and the factorisation scale, \u03bc F , which are set to the same value in Powheg, an estimate of the effects of the missing higher-order terms can be made. To evaluate the uncertainty, the scales are varied independently from one half to twice the central value, and the cross-section variations are added in quadrature. The effect of the scale uncertainties on the NLO prediction ranges from 20 to 50%, and dominates the theoretical uncertainty. The uncertainties due to the choice of PDFs are estimated from the 52 eigenvectors of the CT10 PDF set evaluated at 68% confidence level, and are in the range 5-10% for the variables investigated. Other cross-checks were performed, such as a study of the effect due to the b-quark mass uncertainty and of the scale matching between Powheg and the parton shower.

The cross section decreases with increasing mass except for a step around 550 GeV. This value corresponds approximately to twice the p T requirement on the leading jet, i.e. to a mass region where the flavour-creation process, with two almost back-to-back b-jets, becomes the dominant production mechanism. Powheg provides a very good description of the data over the whole mass spectrum, with the exception of the high-mass region where a small deficit in the prediction is seen. The MC@NLO prediction is consistently below the data for m bb < 350 GeV, at which point it becomes higher than data.

Six dijet variables are investigated to probe the bb phase space: the invariant mass, the transverse momentum, and the boost of the dijet system; the azimuthal angle, the angular separation, and the rapidity difference between the two b-jets. The dijet system is defined as the two highestp T b-jets in the event with p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, requiring a minimum R of 0.4. A further requirement of a jet in the event with a minimum transverse momentum of 270 GeV is applied.",

The use of singlejet triggers with high p T thresholds significantly changes the relative weight of the different production processes with respect to an almost unbiased selection [9], with an enhancement of the gluon-splitting mechanism by strongly suppressing the lowp T,bb region where the flavour-creation process dominates. Under these conditions, MC@NLO shows significant deviations from data for all variables, both in terms of shape and normalisation. Powheg generally reproduces well the measured differential cross sections, although it underestimates the data at low p T,bb . The LO predictions approximately reproduce all distributions although some bins show deviations of up to about 50%.",
