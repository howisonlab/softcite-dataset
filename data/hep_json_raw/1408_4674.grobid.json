It is based on the analysis of data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2011 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.14 nb \u22121 and 0.15 nb \u22121 in the muon and electron decay channels, respectively. The differential production yields and lepton charge asymmetry are each measured as a function of the average number of participating nucleons N part and absolute pseudorapidity of the charged lepton. The results are compared to predictions based on next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. These measurements are, in principle, sensitive to possible nuclear modifications to the parton distribution functions and also provide information on scaling of W boson production in multi-nucleon systems.",

            "text": "Studies of particle production in the high-density medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions have been previously conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [1][2][3][4] and have been extended to larger centre-of-mass energies at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN [5,6]. These collisions provide access to a phase of nuclear matter at high temperature and low baryon density called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), in which the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons [7][8][9][10][11]. In a QGP, high-energy partons transfer energy to the medium through multiple interactions and gluon radiation, resulting in a modification of the parton shower of jets (jet-quenching). This effect is consistent with the measurements of high transverse momentum ( p T ) charged hadron yields [12][13][14][15][16], inclusive jets [17] and dijets with asymmetric transverse energies (E T ) [18][19][20].",

At sub-TeV centre-of-mass energies, the only viable candidates for playing this role are photons [21]. However at higher energies, heavy gauge bosons (W \u00b1 and Z ) are also produced in relatively high abundance, introducing an additional avenue for benchmarking in-medium modifications to coloured probes. This potential has already been realised in lead-lead (Pb+Pb) collisions in previous ATLAS [22] and CMS [23][24][25] publications, where it was observed that electroweak boson production rates scale linearly with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.",

A discussion of the procedure for correcting the signal yields is presented in Sect. 7. The systematic uncertainties and the combination of the two channels are described in Sect. 8, and the W boson production yields, measured as a function of the mean number of inelastically interacting nucleons N part and |\u03b7 |, are discussed in Sect. 9. A differential measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry as a function of |\u03b7 | is also presented. These results are compared to predictions at next-to-leading order (NLO) [31][32][33] in QCD, both with and without nuclear corrections. The former is represented by the EPS09 PDF [34].

The N coll estimation in the 80-100 % class suffers from high experimental uncertainties, and therefore, this centrality class is not considered in the analysis. Table 2 presents N part and N coll for each centrality class along with their relative systematic uncertainties (see Sect. 8).

To summarise, these criteria include a set of ID hit requirements in the pixel and SCT layers of the ID, a selection on the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters (|d 0 | and |z 0 |), and a minimum requirement on the quality of the muon track fit. Additional selection criteria specific to W bosons are discussed below. Decays-in-flight from pions and kaons contribute a small background fraction in this analysis. They are reduced by requiring the difference between the ID and MS muon p T measurements (corrected for the mean energy loss due to interactions with the material between the ID and MS) to be less than 50 % of the p T measured in the ID. Decays-in-flight are further reduced by locating changes in the direction of the muon track trajectory. This is performed using a leastsquares track fit that includes scattering angle parameters accounting for multiple scattering between the muon and detector material. Scattering centers are allocated along the muon track trajectory from the ID to MS, and decays are identified by scattering angle measurements much greater than the expectation value due to multiple scattering [53].",

The number of expected QCD multi-jet events is determined by extrapolating the rescaled MC distribution from the control region to the signal p \u03bc T region above 25 GeV. The fraction of background events in the data is then calculated from the ratio of the number of QCD multi-jet events surviving final selection in the MC and the number of W candidates in the data. This is performed as function of \u03b7 \u03bc and centrality. The background fraction is also determined separately for \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 , and no charge dependence is observed. The multi-jet background fraction is estimated to be on average 3.7 % of the total number of W \u00b1 boson candidates, varying from 2.0 % to 5.4 % as a function of \u03b7 \u03bc and centrality.",

This method involves using a control sample from the data to construct a QCD background template and simulated W \u2192 e\u03bd e events to construct a signal template. The control sample is selected by employing looser electron identification criteria based solely on shower shape information and inverting the isolation requirement. In addition, if the event contains a jet reconstructed at EM scale with E T > 25 GeV, the difference between the azimuthal angle of the jet and p miss T is required to be greater than \u03c0/2. This condition suppresses events with spurious p miss T originating from miscalibration of a jet [54]. The nominal p miss T and m T criteria are also applied to the control sample. The background and signal templates are fit to the data as a function of p e T in the signal region after electroweak background subtraction. A result of the fit is shown in Fig. 4. The fit result slightly underestimates the data at p e T 60 GeV, but this difference is within the total uncertainty of the fit. A significant contribution to this uncertainty comes from the limited number of events available for determining the QCD multi-jet background. The fitting is    The background from electroweak processes with electrons in the final state is estimated from the MC samples listed in Table 1. The nominal selection criteria of this analysis are imposed on each MC sample. The absolute normalisation is derived from the W and Z Powheg cross-sections in pp collisions. These cross-sections are scaled by N coll in each centrality bin and normalised to the integrated luminosity of the Pb+Pb data sample. This method gives a valid estimate of the electroweak background in this analysis since ATLAS has recently demonstrated that the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 yields in Pb+Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are consistent with the pp expectation scaled by T A A to within 3 % [22]. The Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 background is the dominant electroweak back-ground in this analysis and amounts to 6.5 % of the total W \u2192 e\u03bd e candidate events. The background from W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 contributes an additional 2.5 %. Electrons from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and tt are found to be <0.3 % and <0.1 %, respectively. As with the muon channel, the latter two background sources are considered negligible. Figure 5 shows the |\u03b7 e | and p e T distributions for positively and negatively charged electrons after final event selection.  In order to correct the data for losses attributable to the trigger, reconstruction, and selection efficiencies, a correction factor is applied to the measured yields after background subtraction. This correction factor C W \u00b1 is defined by the following ratio:",

There are two contributing factors: how well the MC simulation represents the shape of the QCD multi-jet muon p T distribution -particularly in the high-p T region -and to what degree this distribution is altered by jet energy-loss in the medium. Both contributions may be accounted for by scaling the muon p T distribution from simulated QCD multi-jet events by a p T -dependent nuclear modification factor. The scale factors are calculated according to the procedure from Ref. [15] and are defined as the ratio of the inclusive charged hadron yield per binary collision in a heavy-ion event and the charged hadron yield in a pp collision. This is performed for each centrality class. Since there is little difference between the nuclear modification factor between heavy-flavour muons and inclusive charged hadrons [15,56], this scaling procedure is a valid estimation of the extrapolation uncertainty.

An uncertainty in the muon p T resolution due to differences in the detector performance in simulation relative to actual data-taking conditions is estimated by additionally smearing the p T of muons in the MC simulation in the range allowed by the systematic uncertainties in Ref. [57]. The correction factors are then re-evaluated, and the yield variation is used as the systematic uncertainty. The relative uncertainty from this procedure results in a variation of less than 1.0 % in the number of signal events in each \u03b7 \u03bc , centrality, and charge class. Uncertainties in the muon reconstruction efficiency are also estimated from Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events. To estimate this uncertainty, Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 MC events are re-weighted such that the ratio of the number of muon pairs reconstructed using both the ID and MS components and muon pairs reconstructed using only the MS component -with no restriction on the ID component -agree in data and the MC simulation.

Uncertainties in the muon trigger efficiency are determined from differences in the efficiencies calculated using single muons from MB events and a tag-and-probe method applied to a Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 sample.

This uncertainty is mainly attributable to the PDF uncertainty, which has been studied extensively in pp collisions at the LHC by ATLAS [26] using the same PDF set that this analysis uses to correct the data. The uncertainties are derived from differences in the correction factor using various PDF sets, differences due to the parton-shower modelling, and the PDF error eigenvectors. These individual contributions are added in quadrature and result in uncertainties at the 0.2 % level. An uncertainty of 0.3 % is associated with the differential production measurement in the highest |\u03b7 \u03bc | bin. Table 3 presents a summary of the maximum values for all systematic uncertainties included in the muon channel.

Proton-proton collisions alone would result in a ratio of W + and W \u2212 bosons significantly above unity, but in Pb+Pb collisions, the larger number of d valence quarks in the neutron increases W \u2212 production, driving the ratio closer to one. This is supported by Fig. 7, which presents the fiducial charge ratio as a function of N part for the combined muon and electron channels. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the differential production yields per binary collision for the muon and electron channels, separately, as a function of |\u03b7 | for W + and W \u2212 . A good agreement is found between the two decay modes. In both decay channels, the distribution from W + bosons events. This behaviour is understood and is further discussed below in connection to the charge asymmetry.

The W \u00b1 The W boson production yields are presented as a function of N part and |\u03b7 |. These yields, scaled by 1/ N coll , are independent of centrality and in agreement with NLO QCD predictions. The lepton charge asymmetry from W \u00b1 boson decays differs from measurements in pp collisions. This is expected since in Pb+Pb collisions there is an additional neutron component contributing to W boson production. The lepton charge asymmetry agrees well with theoretical predictions using QCD at NLO with CT10 PDF sets with and without EPS09 nuclear corrections. The nuclear corrections account for modifications that are not present in the PDF of free nucleons. However, further improvements in the experimental precision and uncertainties in the theory are needed to establish the existence of nuclear effects. The results presented here clearly indicate that in events associated with a jet, W bosons are an excellent tool for evaluating jet energy-loss in a QGP. Moreover, it was demonstrated that W bosons can be used to study PDFs in multi-nucleon systems. With improved statistical and systematic precision, along with additional data from different colliding systems such as p+Pb, it will be possible to decisively evaluate the extent of nuclear effects on PDFs and to further test theoretical predictions. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
