Despite many careful studies, there is at present no compelling experimental evidence for the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry [1]. However, many candidate theories of quantum gravity can accommodate the spontaneous breaking of this spacetime symmetry [2]. These theories have driven the development of potential Lorentz violation models [3], as well as experimental methodologies for direct searches [4,5]. In the process, it has been observed that the interferometric nature of neutrino oscillations makes them sensitive probes, uniquely suited to address certain models for Lorentz violation.",

The Double Chooz experiment first reported an indication for the disappearance of antineutrinos propagating \u223c1050 m from two 4.25 MW reactor cores [6]. The Daya Bay [7] and RENO [8] reactor experiments subsequently observed this disappearance at the discovery level. The results are consistent with oscillations within a standard three-neutrino mixing model [9,10], where the magnitude of the disappearance is parameterized by the mixing angle \u03b8 13 . The observation of electron neutrino appearance from muon neutrino beams in long baseline acceleratorbased experiments [11,12] is further validation of the discovery of non-zero \u03b8 13 .",

Minute deviations from exact Lorentz invariance could lead to violations of the conservation of angular momentum, triggering neutrino-antineutrino mixing. Neutrinos are not readily detectable by the reactor experiments, which nominally search for a coincidence signal characteristic of antineutrino interactions only. As a result, neutrino-antineutrino oscillations may be exhibited as disappearance in the data set. Isolating this additional disappearance contribution requires an analysis of the antineutrino candidate event energy spectrum. Currently, only the Double Chooz data can be used for this purpose, as it is the only reactor experiment that has published and made avail-able their measured energy spectrum with a full error matrix.",

For this reason, a fit to the energy spectrum allows the potential separation of the three types of contributions to the Hamiltonian due to their characteristic energy dependence.",

The data release information is used here in order to search for neutrinoantineutrino oscillations and the breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Double Chooz breaks up the data into two \"integration periods\". One period utilizes data taken with both reactors on and one period utilizes data taken with one reactor at <20% thermal power. The antineutrino spectral information then comes in terms of the prompt positron's visible energy from 0.7-12.2 MeV. This is converted to antineutrino energy with E \u223c = E prompt + 0.78 MeV.

It is important to notice that the absence of a significant signal of Lorentz violation could appear due to a rather unlikely cancellation between different coefficients. Nonetheless, each of the components of the effective Hamiltonian appears coupled to a different factor (M (1) x\u0113 ) cd , whose convoluted energy dependence makes any cancellation possible only at a given neutrino energy. For this reason, the absence of a positive signal in the entire energy spectrum used in this study allows us to conclude that each component is individually small; therefore, we can set upper limits on the factors C (0) cd and C (1) cd by considering only one component of the Hamiltonian at a time.

Similar results appear for the oscillations caused by \u03b4h \u00b5\u03bc and \u03b4h \u03c4\u03c4 , whereas the off-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) produce modifications involving both C (0) cd and C (1) cd . Due to the symmetry of the oscillation probability equation, the \u00b5\u03bc and \u03c4\u03c4 as well as the e\u03bc and e\u03c4 fit functions and results are the same. In order to study the three-neutrino oscillation contributions to the reactor signal it is advantageous to account for current constraints on \u03b8 13 . Since we are testing the possibility of Lorentz violation modifying the antineutrino disappearance probability in Double Chooz, it would be incongruous to use the value of this mixing angle measured through the disappearance channel in reactor experiments. We therefore take T2K's result sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) T2K = 0.088 +0.049 \u22120.039 , given for a normal hierarchy, \u03b4 CP = 0, \u2206m 2 atm =2.4\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 , and \u03b8 23 = 45 \u2022 , and use it as a constraint in the fits [11]. It is likely that the T2K and MINOS appearance measurements are dominated by mass-based (\u03b8 13 ) oscillations, rather than Lorentz violation, because they are mutually consistent and yet have very different sensitivities to Lorentz violation themselves given their differing baselines (295 km and 735 km) and neutrino energy spectra (<0.6 GeV> and <3 GeV>). We do note, however, that the Lorentzviolating oscillation of muon neutrinos into electron antineutrinos could mimic the electron-like appearance signal observed in T2K. We considered this possibility and found that the spectral distribution of the few electronlike events in T2K disfavors this type of Lorentz-violating oscillation because the effects of the coefficients H \u03b1 cd and g \u03b1\u03b2 cd grow with L 2 and L 2 E 2 , respectively. This means that a non-zero value of the SME coefficients would have to be of order 10 \u221223 or less for the result to be compatible with T2K data. The vastly different baselines and energies of the antineutrinos in reactor experiments make them largely insensitive to possible violations of Lorentz invariance affecting long-baseline experiments. These reasons allow us to take the T2K measurement of \u03b8 13 to be free of Lorentz-violating effects within the reach of Double Chooz.",

            "text": "The reactor-based antineutrino experiments' recent measurement of non-zero \u03b8 13 is an important milestone in particle physics and represents the satisfaction of the main prerequisite for a precise determination of the CPviolating phase in the lepton sector. These experiments are sensitive to more than just \u03b8 13 , however. The collections of electron antineutrino events can also be used as a sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work, we have taken the Double Chooz results, made explicit and clear in the form of a detailed data release, and conducted a search for neutrinoantineutrino oscillations. No evidence for this exotic process has been found and we set limits on 15 previously unexplored SME coefficients. This analysis shows that antineutrinos in the Double Chooz experiment are sensitive to Lorentz-violating effects suppressed by the Planck-scale (M P 10 19 GeV), naively expected to be at the level of the ratio of the weak and Planck scales (M W /M P 10 \u221217 ) or below. The coefficients driving Lorentz invariance violation have been constrained at the 10 \u221219 level while CPT-violating ones have been limited up to the 10 \u221217 level. These values, obtained with a reactor-based experiment, are of a similar order as the limits obtained by the neutrino-beam experiments LSND [17], MiniBooNE [18], and MINOS (near detec-tor) [19]. Nevertheless, we emphasize that the coefficients considered in this analysis are independent and their possible effects have now been studied for the first time. This work completes the coverage of operators in the minimal SME producing neutrino-antineutrino mixing.",
