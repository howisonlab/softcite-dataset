The suppression of light mesons at high transverse momentum, compared to expectations from scaled p + p results, reflects the properties of the strongly interacting matter formed. The \u03c6-meson is one of the probes whose systematic measurement in p + p, d + Au and Au + Au collisions can provide useful information about initial and final state effects on particle production. The mass, width and branching ratio of the \u03c6-meson decay in the di-kaon and di-electron decay channels could be modified in Au + Au collisions due to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the QGP.",

It is is the lightest bound state of hidden strangeness ss, has a small interaction with other non-strange hadrons and hence carries information from the early partonic stages of the system evolution. Comparing the elliptic flow (v 2 ) of \u03c6 to the v 2 of other multistrange hadrons (\u2126 and \u039e) or particles composed of lighter quarks (u and d) or heavier charm quark, provides information about the partonic collectivity of the medium.",

A certain fraction of the \u03c6 can decay inside the hot and dense media leading to a change in its spectral function [1,2]. This modification can be seen by studying the low-momentum \u03c6 decaying inside the media and reconstructed via the di-electron decay channel. Since leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, they preserve their production information. A change in mass or width (\u0393) of \u03c6 inside the medium can lead to a change in the relative branching ratios of the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and \u03c6 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay modes. Since m \u03c6 \u2248 2 \u00d7 m K , small changes in \u03c6 or K can induce significant changes in the branching ratio. The PHENIX detector [3] at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) has been designed to measure both leptons and hadrons.",

The Zero Degree Claorimeters (ZDC's) and Beam Beam Counters (BBC's) are dedicated subsystems that measure global quantities such as luminosity, collision vertex and event centrality. The minimum bias trigger is derived by a coincidence between the two BBCs; in p + p and d + Au the trigger requires at least one hit in each BBC arm whereas for Au + Au at least two hits in each BBC arm and one detected neutron in ZDC is needed. In order to benefit from the high luminosity in p + p and d + Au collisions and to efficiently detect electrons, a special online EMCal RICH trigger (ERT) is used. It requires an event to have at least one track with an energy above a certain threshold in the EMCal and a geometrically correlated hit in the RICH.

The second method requires one track to be identified as Kaon in the TOF subsystem (One Kaon\"PID\"), whereas the third method requires both the tracks to be identified as Kaons either in TOF or EMCal subsystems (\"Two Kaon PID\"). The \"No Kaon PID\" method allows us to go to high p T as compared to the other two, is a relatively simpler analysis, but with comparatively large B/S ratio. The \"Two Kaons PID\" method allows us to go lower in p T and has small B/S ratio. The \"One Kaon PID\" method has the advantage of less background and so works with better accuracy for the low p T (< 2 GeV/c) region where \"No Kaon PID\" method has a large background. The p + p data was analyzed using \"No Kaon PID\", and \"One Kaon PID\", d + Au using \"No Kaon PID\" and \"Two Kaons PID\" and Au+Au using \"One Kaon PID\"and \"Two Kaons PID\". The 62.4 GeV Au+Au data was analyzed using \"Two Kaons PID\" method only. The different analysis methods have very different sources of systematic uncertainities and provide a valuable consistency check. In Fig. 2(a), good agreement between the various methods can be seen.

The right panel of the Fig. 4 shows universal scaling behavior of the elliptic flow of baryons and mesons when both v 2 and KE T are scaled with the number of valence quarks.

The v 2 of \u03c6 follows the flow pattern of other mesons as well as scales with n q =2, indicating partonic collectivity. R dAu of \u03c6 does not show any suppression, but large error bars leave room for Cronin enhancement. The R AA of \u03c6 shows a similar suppression pattern to that of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 at high p T , but at intermediate p T , the suppression level is different.",
