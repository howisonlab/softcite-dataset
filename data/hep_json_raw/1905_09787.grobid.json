            "text": "The observation of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos are massive [1]. This requires the addition of a neutrino mass-generation mechanism to the Standard Model (SM), which can manifest itself in the form of right-handed neutrinos, Majorana neutrinos, or both. Adding a right-handed Majorana neutrino (denoted by heavy neutral lepton HNL, or simply N ) gives rise to the so-called Type-1 Seesaw mechanism [2]. An SM neutrino then acquires a mass inversely proportional to the HNL Majorana mass, providing a natural explanation for neutrino masses and why they are so small compared with those of other fermions. Heavy neutral leptons could generate the observed amount of baryon asymmetry in the universe through a process known as leptogenesis [3], and an HNL with a mass of the order of keV would be a valid dark-matter candidate [4]. In fact, the addition of three HNLs with masses below the electroweak scale, two of which are potentially accessible by accelerator-based experiments in the range 0.1-90 GeV [5], could address the three",

            "text": "Heavy neutral leptons with masses below 5 GeV can be produced in hadron decays. In this case, sensitivity to small coupling strengths has been achieved by fixed-target experiments with long decay volumes and by high-intensity collider experiments [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. Higher HNL masses can only be directly accessed through the decays of W , Z or H bosons, and indirectly through precision tests of the SM. Within some assumptions about the relative HNL mixing angles to the different neutrino flavours, experiments sensitive for processes such as \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 or \u00b5 \u2192 eee can provide indirect constraints which are competitive with direct searches for HNL masses above 30 GeV [22]. An analysis with the DELPHI experiment at LEP1 using \u223c10 6 neutrinos from Z boson decays provided the best direct constraints prior to the LHC in the HNL mass range 2-75 GeV [23]. At hadron colliders, HNLs are better sought in W rather than Z boson decays due to trigger requirements and the higher production cross section. The CMS Collaboration presented results [24] which explore HNL masses in the range 1-1200 GeV and mixing to muon and electron neutrinos, using a signature of W boson decays into three prompt leptons with lepton-number violation (LNV) similar to the prompt signature presented in this search. The high rate of W boson production at the LHC, combined with the capability of the ATLAS and CMS experiments to reconstruct displaced vertices in their inner detectors, permits HNLs with longer lifetimes to be accessed in regions of the parameter space that are beyond the LEP constraints and allowed by cosmological constraints [25][26][27][28][29].",

The heavy neutrino N is allowed to mix exclusively with either \u03bd \u00b5 or \u03bd e and to decay leptonically in a scenario with either lepton-number conservation (LNC) or LNV, as illustrated in figure 1. The Majorana nature of N results in equal mixing to neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and the possibility for the process to violate the lepton number (although LNV is not guaranteed [32]), as shown in figures 1c, 1d and 1e. The range 5 < m N < 50 GeV is explored using the prompt signature assuming LNV. The range 4.5 < m N < 10 GeV, corresponding to decay lengths of the order mm\u2212cm, is probed down to lower |U | 2 values using the displaced signature with HNL mixing to \u03bd \u00b5 without any assumption regarding LNC or LNV, as depicted in figures 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d.",

The sample is normalised using the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) cross section, including soft-gluon resummation to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) [54][55][56][57][58][59][60]. For events containing a W or Z boson with associated jets simulated using Sherpa, matrix elements were generated with up to two additional parton emissions at NLO accuracy and up to four additional parton emissions at LO accuracy using COMIX [61] and OpenLoops [62] and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [63] according to the ME+PS@NLO prescription [64]. Diboson processes with one of the bosons decaying hadronically and the other leptonically are calculated for up to one (ZZ) or zero (W W , W Z) additional partons at NLO and up to three additional partons at LO using COMIX and OpenLoops, and merged with the Sherpa parton shower according to the ME+PS@NLO prescription. Matrix elements of triboson processes containing two or more charged leptons were generated with Sherpa including off-shell contributions with up to one additional real emission at LO accuracy [65].",

It considers the case where the vertex displacement is small enough that an ID track can be reconstructed with standard ATLAS tracking algorithms. The standard reconstruction of tracks in the ID is optimised for charged particles that originate from the beam spot, the region where the proton beams intersect. This set-up restricts the detection for decay products of particles whose decay vertex is significantly displaced from the beam spot, especially for transverse displacements greater than approximately 20 mm [73]. By requiring the final state to have three isolated leptons and no opposite-charge same-flavour lepton pairs, background events from Drell-Yan pair production, W +jets and tt could be rejected. Events are required to have a primary vertex defined as the reconstructed vertex with the largest sum of squared track transverse momenta. For the muon channel, events are selected with a dimuon trigger with transverse momentum p T thresholds of 18 and 8 GeV for events recorded in 2015 and of 22 and 8 GeV for events recorded in 2016.

This was found to be anti-correlated with the statistical uncertainty parameterisations of MC and multi-fake backgrounds in the lowest bin of CR-3, as a consequence of a statistical fluctuation of data in the low-p T spectrum of this region. Further checks were conducted, including a p-value test in the signal region using normalisation factors as measured in the CRs. The p-values are determined without taking into account the fit parameters associated with statistical uncertainty in the SR and found to be 7.2% for the muon channel and 13.2% for the electron channel. As this lies above the usual rejection level of 5%, the test is considered satisfactory. Upon using the background-only hypothesis normalised in both CRs and SR very good compatibility was found.   -15 -",

First, a discovery hypothesis test is performed in which a rejection of the background-only model given the observed data is examined. Afterwards, the signal strength in the signal-plus-background model is fixed to different values and the CL S [85] method is used to exclude various signal strengths. Exclusion limits on the signal-strength fit parameter translate directly into limits on |U | 2 . A signal with a given mixing angle is considered excluded once the p-value for the CL S =CL s+b /CL b value is below 0.05 and therefore corresponds to a 95% confidence-level exclusion limit. An overview of different signal shapes in the SR is shown in figure 5 for which the signal yield corresponds to a 95% confidence-level exclusion limit for each mass point. The exclusion limits in |U \u00b5 | 2 and |U e | 2 for the different signal hypotheses are shown in figure 6 together with those obtained from the displaced HNL search. The expected limits are determined using the results of a CR-only fit as input to the limit extraction procedure. The offset by almost 1\u03c3 from the expected limit for the muon channel shown in figure 6 originates from the use of central values for the statistical uncertainty Gamma distributions in the SR for the Asimov dataset. In figure 5, scaled (post-fit) Gamma nuisance parameters are used for the statistical uncertainty parameters, which largely dominate over systematic uncertainties. For the electron channel, the post-fit statistical uncertainty parameters deviate less from their central value as \u00b5 mf has more freedom in the CRs, and consequently a general offset is not observed. The deviation for the muon channel is a consequence of the aforementioned \u00b5 mf constraint in the lowest bin of CR-3.",

This control sample has undergone LRT and thus consists of events collected by a variety of different triggers and preselections. With the requirement of at least one DV, this sample contains 12 times more events than the sample of events passing the preselection. Sub-categories are defined for DVs containing no reconstructed lepton (0-lepton) and only one reconstructed lepton (1-lepton), as requiring two leptons (2-lepton) would lead to an insufficient number of events for this study. For m DV < 2.5 GeV, more events with 0-lepton and 1-lepton DVs are observed in the high-density material region as compared to the low-density region (as expected from hadronic interactions in material). Likewise, more opposite-charge events are observed than same-charge events (as expected from metastable particle decays). This shows that these two types of backgrounds contribute at low mass. Above m DV = 2.5 GeV, the m DV distributions fall quickly and coincide within 5% regardless of the DV being in a high-density or low-density material region, regardless of the tracks being same-charge or opposite-charge, and regardless of the number of tight leptons identified in the DV. The conclusion of this study is that, in the signal region (m DV > 4 GeV), backgrounds from hadronic interactions and metastable particle decays provide a contribution of less than 5% relative to other sources of background.",

These peaks correspond to decay distances in the range 4-40 mm, consistent with the decays of b-hadrons into J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S). From integrating fits to these two peaks in the region m DV > 4 GeV, taking into account the fact that this sample is statistically enhanced relative to the samples used in the search as well as fit uncertainties, a contribution of less than 0.005 background events from J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays is estimated in the signal region. No contributions from the very short-lived \u03a5 meson are expected due to the fact that the probability for them to result in displaced decays is negligible, and indeed no two-muon DVs are found for m DV > 3.85 GeV in the control sample.",

This is done by applying a transfer factor from 0-lepton DVs to 2-lepton DVs obtained in the same-charge control region. This provides an unbiased estimate of all backgrounds remaining after the selection for which the ratio of 2-lepton background DVs to 0-lepton background DVs does not depend on the DV charge configuration. While this is the case for accidental crossings including those involving cosmic-ray muons, it does not include single cosmic-ray muons reconstructed as back-to-back muons nor decays of neutral hadrons which are either metastable or produced in material interactions, which can be neglected in the m DV > 4 GeV region as discussed above. The validity of the method is verified by performing the estimate on a validation sample of 1-lepton DVs. The numbers of events observed in the control regions are reported in table 6. The estimated numbers of events in the 1-lepton DV validation region for electron and muon are compatible with the observed numbers within statistical uncertainties. From a 90% confidence-level limit of 2.3 background events with 2-lepton DVs in the same-charge DV control region (where 0 are observed), an upper limit of 2.3 \u00d7 168037/169254 \u223c 2.3 is obtained for the 2-lepton DVs in the signal region (where 0 are observed).",

The prompt signature requires three prompt leptons (either muons or electrons) with no same-flavour opposite-charge configuration. It probes mean HNL proper decay lengths of 1 mm or less, with the assumption of lepton-number violation. The displaced signature, explored for the first time at the LHC, features a prompt muon accompanied by a vertex displaced in the radial direction by 4-300 mm from the beam line containing two opposite-charge leptons (either two muons or a muon and an electron) with a reconstructed vertex mass m DV > 4 GeV.
