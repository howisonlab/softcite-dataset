            "text": "Top quark is produced in pair in strong interactions but can also be produced in electroweak interactions. In the latter processes only one top quark appears in the final state. Therefore this set of processes is generically dubbed single top. Formally the single top production proceeds by different Feynman diagrams and you can distinguish in figure 1 production through t (a), Wt (b) and s (c) channels. At hadron colliders (see table 1) the three processes have quite different cross sections strongly dependent by the center of mass energy and the PDF of the incoming partons. Going from 2 to 7 and 8 TeV, t and Wt production increases by factor 30 \u00f7 40 while s channel only increases by a factor 4. We will discuss later the implications of this effect, due to the different (pp versus pp) initial state.",

Finally the Wt channel has two Ws and one jet in the final state.

The signal region is the one with two jets and one tag, the other two are used as control regions. Table 3 shows, as an example, the sample composition after all requirements in the 8 TeV ATLAS data. In the 2 jet bin t channel is \u2248 12 % of the total number of events, Wt \u2248 4 % and s channel is less than 1 %. CMS explored the data set collected in 2011 at 7 TeV searching for top produced in t channel using three differ-  ent techniques. One (dubbed \"\u03b7 j \u2032 \") exploits a characteristic feature of t-channel single top events: the forward pseudorapidity of the light jet recoiling against the top. The other two (Neural Network and BDT) are multivariate techniques that compare signal expectation with observation. The aim of the multivariate analyses is to combine the information contained in the signal enriched and signal depleted regions to obtain a precision measurement of the single top cross section. The luminosity used is \u2243 1.2 (1.7) fb \u22121 for electrons(muons). In the \u03b7 j \u2032 analysis CMS exploits the different kinematical properties of signal and W+ jets background to further split the signal region (2 jet, 1 tag) into signal rich and background enriched regions. In figure 4 you can see the mass distribution for the M l\u03bdb system [13]. After requiring 130 < M l\u03bdb < 220 GeV/c 2 the S/B reaches \u2243 1/5. This provides enough separation that a simple fit to the |\u03b7| distribution of the most forward jets is sufficient to measure the single top cross section (see figure 5).",

In general the increase of luminosity comes with a dear price of a very large amount of pile-up. While the Collaborations have shown their capability to deal with this new    challenge, its impact on the accuracy of future measurements cannot be underestimated.",

The situation is far from being satisfying. While the CMS 7 TeV measurement [5] has an uncertainty of \u2248 5 %, all the other results (including the most recent one by CMS at 8 TeV) have uncertainties at the level of 10%, too large to challenge the SM. As the LHC has already large statistics, these measurements are (mostly) systematics limited. It is a challenge to tackle in order to use this process as a tool to search for new physics in the top sector. 04004-p.5",
