The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-mass WIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6%. With a fiducial liquid xenon target mass of 54.0 kg, no significant excess events were found above the expected background. A profile likelihood ratio analysis confirms our earlier finding that the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported in the literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on a low mass WIMP is set at WIMP mass below 10 GeV/c 2 , demonstrating that liquid xenon detectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.",

            "text": "The existence of gravitationally attractive \"dark matter\" that dominates the matter composition of the universe has been firmly established based on overwhelming evidence from astronomical and cosmological observations [1]. Whether such abundant matter consists of yet unknown elementary particles remains one of the most pressing scientific questions. There are strong theoretical motivations for the existence of beyond the Standard Model physics, many of which naturally predict new stable neutral particles at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale with weak interactions, generically named weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [2,3]. WIMPs are a leading dark matter (DM) candidate where weak interactions between WIMPs and ordinary matter allow for a direct search for these particles through particle physics experiments. In recent decades, direct searches of WIMP interactions with terrestrial detectors have been carried out in deep underground laboratories worldwide with ever increasing discovery power [4].",

            "text": "To achieve sensitivities to WIMPs beyond the current experimental bounds, detectors with larger targets, lower background, and lower energy threshold are required. In the past decade, dual phase xenon detectors have rapidly emerged as one of the most promising technologies in WIMP direct detection, leading the WIMP search sensitivity in a wide range of parameter space [10][11][12]19], demonstrating superior scalability in mass, and the capability to shield against and reject background. However, in comparison to the cryogenic bolometers [8,15] or semiconductor ionization detectors [6,16,17], dual phase liquid xenon detectors have not demonstrated the ability to obtain a comparably low energy threshold. Conventionally, the issue is attributed to insufficient light collection efficiency or a lack of understanding of the low energy nuclear recoil (NR) quenching factor. In recent years, the LUX and PandaX collaborations operated newly designed liquid xenon detectors which were constructed to optimize light collection efficiency. At the same time, a comprehensive model of scintillation and ionization processes in xenon known as the NEST [20][21][22], developed with simple phenomenological models and based on consideration of world data, is gradually being adopted in the xenon field. The values of the relative scintillation efficiency (L ef f ) from NEST decrease continuously down to zero energy, which is consistent and slightly lower than that from an independent phenomenological calculation [23]. These developments call for careful re-examination of the low mass WIMP sensitivity using xenon detectors. In Ref. [13], we reported the first 17.4 live days null search results in PandaX-I. In this paper, we present an improved analysis including the full PandaX-I data set, starting from May 26, 2014 to Oct. 16, 2014, with a total of 80.1 live-day exposure in the search for dark matter. We shall refer to these data as dark matter search data in the remainder of this paper.",

            "text": "PandaX is a dual-phase liquid xenon dark matter experiment [24] located at the China Jin-Ping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) [25]. The first phase PandaX-I is a pancake-shaped 120 kg detector optimized for light collection targeted for low mass WIMPs [13,24]. The xenon chamber is a stainless steel inner vessel with an inner diameter of 750 mm, housing approximately 450 kg of liquid xenon. The entire inner vessel sits in an outer vacuum vessel constructed from 5-cm thick high-purity oxygenfree copper serving also as a radon barrier and electromagnetic shield, and enclosed by a passive shield made of copper, polyethylene, lead, and polyethylene, from inner to outer layers. The gap between the outer vessel and the passive shield is continuously flushed with boil-off nitrogen to maintain a radon level of less than 5 Bq/m 3 , more than a factor of 20 below the level in the experimental hall. The central time-projection-chamber (TPC) is a cylinder with diameter of 60 cm and height of 15 cm confined by a cathode grid (\u221215 kV) at the bottom, a gate grid (\u22125 kV) and an anode mesh (ground) separated by 8 mm, below and above the liquid level respectively, and a surrounding Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflective wall. After a particle-xenon interaction, prompt scintillation photons (S1 signal) are produced in the liquid. Ionized electrons are then drifted vertically upward by an induced drift field and extracted into the gas by an extraction field, producing the electroluminescence (S2 signal). A top photomultiplier tube (PMT) array consists of 143 Hamamatsu R8520-406 (1-in square) tubes and a bottom array holds 37 Hamamatsu R11410-MOD (3-in circular) tubes. The PMTs view the active volume, collecting photons from both the S1 and S2 signals, with the bottom array dominating the light collection for both S1 and S2 signals. The radioactivity from the bottom PMT array is shielded by a layer of 5 cm thick LXe below the cathode and the PMT surface. The average dark rate per tube, i.e. the rate of random single photoelectrons (PEs), is 0.06 kHz and 1.07 kHz for top and bottom PMTs, respectively. The time separation between S1 to S2 signals gives the vertical position of the interaction, and the horizontal position is encoded in the S2 charge pattern in the PMT arrays. Multiple scatter events can be identified from the data by events which contain multiple S2 signals, either separated in time if they happen at different vertical position or separated in the horizontal plane if there are multiple charge clusters in the PMT pattern. Gamma ray background produces electron recoil (ER) events whereas the dark matter signal produces nuclear recoil events. The ratio of S1 and S2 signal area gives a powerful means of ER rejection when looking for DM-like NR signals [26].",

The waveform is then integrated in the \"hit window\" to define the hit charge. The hits in different channels are then clustered in time using an improved charge dependent algorithm with high efficiency for in-time short S1 signals while avoiding splitting a low charge but wide S2 into multiple clusters. For each cluster, a software sum is formed on all digitized channels, from which one computes the full-width-half-maximum, the full-width-1/10maximum, as well as the number of peaks in the cluster. A binary decision tree method is developed to sort any given cluster into S1-like and S2-like signals based on these variables.

In addition, cuts are placed on the ratio of the height to area and that of the height to width. To avoid signals from afterpulsing, S1 signals are required to be before the first good S2 signal. For S2, we developed a shape symmetry cut to remove events very close to the anode when S1 and S2 cannot be easily separated in time, identifying those events with a characteristic sharp spike at the beginning of the S2 pulse. In addition, S2-like signals will be discarded if its ratio to the largest S2 is less than 1% or if such signal is consistent with a single-electron S2 with charge less than 30 PE; the inefficiency due to these two cuts is estimated to be negligible by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.",

Horizontal position of the interaction is reconstructed with the S2 PMT charge pattern using multiple algorithms. As an improvement to the charge center of gravity (CoG) method, we developed a fast charge pattern template matching (TM) method. The expected charge templates were generated using a custom GEANT4 [29] based Monte Carlo which simulates optical photon propagation from S2 signals in the PandaX-I TPC geometry, identical to the templates used in the fast artificial neural network (FANN) reconstruction method developed by the independent analysis. The difference in the horizontal positions from the FANN and TM methods is on average 5 mm, obtained using 40 keV de-excitation events from neutron calibration data. This is independent of the radial and vertical positions and consistent with the expected position resolution from MC. In the analysis presented here, the TM reconstruction is chosen.

For a fixed energy deposition in the detector, the PMT arrays see different light and charge yields depending on the spatial location of the event, which must be corrected to a detector average before further analysis is performed. The uniformities for S1 and S2 are verified to be decoupled in the vertical direction and horizontal plane. The horizontal variation of 40 keV S2 peaks in the 54.0 kg fiducial volume is measured to be \u00b136%, which dominates the detector non-uniformity. The vertical uniformity for the S2 signals, characterized by an exponential \"electron lifetime\", reflects the electronegative impurity level in the detector which tends to attenuate the charge signal during drifting. The average electron lifetime in our detector is fit with a decaying exponential and determined to be 328\u00b18 \u00b5s (an attenuation length of about 60 cm as compared to the 15 cm maximum drift distance).

The rate of such events in the 60 Co calibration runs increased to about 568 events/day, and the amount of the rate increase is consistent with the MC expectation.",

The distribution of events in log 10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 is shown in Fig. 10. The majority of the events are consistent with an ER origin. The events located higher than the ER band at low S1 are the accidental backgrounds, more prominent than those in the 60 Co calibration run due to the much lower ER event rate in the dark matter search data. Seven of the candidate events are located below the median of the NR band indicated by the green markers in Figs. 9(a) and 10. For comparison, the expected background in the total sample as well as those below the NR mean is shown in Table IV.

N DM (N nbkg ) is the total number of WIMP particles (neutrons) interacting with the detector during the measurement before efficiency and acceptance cuts. N DM is computed for each given pair of WIMP mass and cross section (m \u03c7 , \u03c3 n\u2212\u03c7 ) assuming the isothermal DM halo model [32,33] with a local dark matter density of 0.3 GeV/c 2 /cm 3 , a circular velocity of 220 km/s, a galactic escape velocity of 544 km/s, and an average earth velocity of 245 km/s. P DM (S1 i , S2 i ) and P nbkg (S1 i , S2 i ) are the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of NR recoil signals for a WIMP with given mass and neutron background, respectively, obtained using the NEST-based MC simulation employing the PDE, EEE, and SEG described earlier. N R (S1 i , S2 i ) is the NR detection efficiency from Fig. 6, with acceptance set to zero if S1 and S2 are outside the ranges of (2,30) and (300, 10, 000) PEs. To obtain the expected measured dark matter and neutron background events, the NR efficiency function has to be averaged over the expected dark matter or neutron background PDF ( N R DM and N R nbkg ) in Eq. 4). N ER and N Acc are the total number of ER and accidental background with detection efficiency taken into account, and P ER (S1 i , S2 i ) (taken to be the same as that obtained from ER calibration from Fig. 7(a), supported by the MC) and P Acc (S1 i , S2 i ) (from Fig. 8(c)) are the corresponding PDFs. The contamination of the accidental background in the ER calibration run is neglected due to the dominating ER rate in the calibration runs. The expected background events are taken from the top row of Table IV. To allow systematic variation in the global efficiency, four normalization nuisance parameters (\u03b4 DM , \u03b4 ER , \u03b4 Acc and \u03b4 nbkg ) are included for the four type of events, constrained by Gaussian variations (G's in Eq. 3) of 20% (DM), 15% (ER), 10% (accidental) and 50% (neutron background) in the penalty terms [34,35].",

The lower the WIMP mass, the softer the recoil energy distribution, therefore the selection threshold on S1 and S2 would more strongly suppress the overall efficiency. To compare the effects of selection thresholds of different experiments on the NR energy, the mean NR energy curves in S1 and S2 are plotted in Fig. 12 based on the NEST-0.98 model with the PDE, EEE, and SEG values from PandaX, XENON100 [36], and LUX [12]. Our selection thresh- old is at about 4.2 keV nr in both S1 and S2. XENON100 achieved a S2 threshold of less than 2 keV nr but a much higher S1 threshold of about 8 keV nr . LUX, on the other hand, achieves an average 3 keV nr threshold on both S1 and S2, but in Ref. [12] they choose to drop the NR efficiency entirely below 3 keV nr . The NEST-1.0 model predicts a higher charge yield for NR, in which case our S1 threshold would stay, but the S2 threshold would improve to about 2.8 keV nr , leading to a better sensitivity for low mass WIMPs. Nevertheless, we chose the NEST-0.98 model to report our final WIMP results. The best fit value to maximize the likelihood function is found at m \u03c7 = 27.5 GeV/c 2 with a \u03c3 \u03c7,N at 4.1\u00d710 \u221245 cm 2 . The value of the likelihood is also consistent with that from the null hypothesis within 1\u03c3, indicating no significant excess over the background. To set the WIMP search upper limit, a standard profile likelihood ratio statistic is formed [34,35]. A Feldman and Cousin approach [37] is used to fit the data as well as a large number of MC simulations using the signal hypothesis at each grid point of (m \u03c7 , \u03c3 n\u2212\u03c7 ). The 90% c.l. upper limit obtained with this approach is shown in Fig. 13 together with the world data, and is verified to be very similar to that obtained assuming an approximate half-\u03c7 2 distribution of the test statistic [34]. A binned likelihood method developed in the independent analysis yields an upper limit in good agreement with the above.

Under the elastic, spin-independent, and isospin conserving WIMP-nucleon scattering model, our limits strongly disfavor the WIMP interpretation of the results from DAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT, CDMS-II-Si and CRESST-II. It is noteworthy that the PDE and EEE used in this analysis are conservative in nature since we inhibited the unstable PMTs. In addition, we have considered the average WIMP detection efficiency with WIMP mass dependence in this analysis (Fig. 11). Compared to that in Ref. [13], in which the DM efficiency is treated only as a function of S1, this treatment is more realistic. Even with these realistic treatments, our results still set a stringent limit at the low WIMP mass region, with a tighter bound than SuperCDMS above the WIMP mass of 7 GeV/c 2 , and the best reported bound in a dual phase xenon detector below a WIMP mass of 5.5 GeV/c 2 . Note that one of the key difference between this analysis and that from LUX in Ref. [12] is that the latter made a conservative choice to model no signal generation for events below 3 keV nr , while in our treatment the signals generation is continuous to zero energy therefore low energy events below the mean energy threshold of 4.2 keV nr could still fluctuate upwards into the detection region. The experimental sensitivity band is obtained using the same approach as above but with hundreds of 80.1day background-only toy MCs based on Table IV using prescribed PDF for each event type, from which one obtains a distribution of \"upper limits\". In Fig. 14, our upper limit is overlaid with the \u00b11-\u03c3 sensitivity band. Consistency is observed, confirming no significant excess over background.",
