The signal selection requires a pair of b-tagged jets consistent with those from a Higgs boson decay, and either an electron or a muon from the W boson decay, together with missing transverse momentum from the corresponding neutrino and the stable neutralinos. The analysis is based on data corresponding to 139 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector. No statistically significant evidence of an excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is found. Limits are set on the direct production of the electroweakinos in simplified models, assuming pure wino cross-sections.

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) is a remarkably successful theory, yet it is clear that this theory is not a complete description of nature. The discovery in 2012 of the SM Higgs boson [1][2][3][4], by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, confirmed the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking and highlighted the hierarchy problem [5][6][7][8]. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [9][10][11][12][13][14], a theoretical extension to the SM, resolves the hierarchy problem by introducing a new fermion (boson) supersymmetric partner for each boson (fermion) in the SM. In SUSY models that conserve R-parity [15], the SUSY particles are produced in pairs. Furthermore, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and weakly interacting, thus constituting a viable dark-matter candidate [16,17]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch",

In 2015-2016 the average number of interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) was \u03bc = 20, increasing to \u03bc = 38 in 2017 and to \u03bc = 37 in 2018.

All simulated samples were produced using the ATLAS simulation infrastructure [33] and Geant 4 [34], or a faster simulation based on a parameterisation of the calorimeter response and Geant 4 for the other detector systems. All simulated events were generated with a varying number of inelastic pp interactions overlaid on the hardscattering event to model the multiple proton-proton interactions in the same and nearby bunch crossings.

Several samples produced without detector simulation were employed to estimate systematic uncertainties associated with the specific configuration of the MC generators used for the nominal SM background samples.

Signal leptons and jets are a subset of the baseline objects with tighter quality requirements which are used to define the search regions.

These limits are shown as a function of the masses of the supersymmetric particles in Fig. 6. They are determined interpolating between the simulated mass points, but no smoothing procedure is applied so that local fluctuations in the limit can be present. A likelihood similar to the one used in the background-only fit, but with additional terms for the SRs, is used for the calculation. The exclusion SRs thus participate in the fit and are used to constrain normalisation and nuisance parameters. A signal is allowed in this likelihood in both the CRs and SRs. The VRs are not used in the fit. The CL s method [92] is used to derive the confidence level of the exclusion for a particular signal model; signal models with a CL s value below 0.05 are excluded at 95% CL. The uncertainties in the observed limit are calculated by varying the cross-section for the signal up and down by its uncertainty. Due to a modest excess observed in some bins of the exclusion signal regions, the observed limit is weaker than the expected limit and extends up to about 740 GeV in m(\u03c7  Table 6 summarises the observed (S obs ) and expected (S exp ) 95% CL upper limits on the number of signal events and on the observed visible cross-section, \u03c3 95 obs , for each of the three cumulative discovery signal regions. These cumulative signal regions are those defined to test for the presence of any beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics processes, where in every case the upper bound on m T is also removed. Upper limits on contributions from new physics processes are estimated using the so-called 'model-independent fit', where a generic BSM process is assumed to contribute only to the SR and not to the CRs, thus giving a conservative background estimate in the SR. When normalised to the integrated luminosity of the data sample, the results can be interpreted as corresponding to observed upper limits \u03c3 95 obs , defined as the product of the production cross-section, the acceptance, and the selection efficiency of a BSM signal. The p 0 values, which represent the probability of the SM background alone to fluctuate to the observed number of events or higher, are also provided.

The FCLoose isolation working point is also required for signal muons [73]. Jets are reconstructed from three-dimensional topological energy clusters in the calorimeters using the anti-k t algorithm [74] with a radius parameter R = 0.4 [75]. Baseline jets are selected in the region |\u03b7| < 4.5 and have p T > 20 GeV. To suppress jets from pile-up interactions, the jets with |\u03b7| < 2.8 and p T < 120 GeV are required to satisfy the 'medium' working point of the jet vertex tagger (JVT), a tagging algorithm that identifies jets originating from the PV using track information [76,77]. The selection of signal jets is further refined by requiring them to be in the region |\u03b7| < 2.8 and have p T > 30 GeV. Jets containing b-hadrons are identified as 'b-tagged' using the MV2c10 algorithm, a multivariate discriminant based on the track impact parameters and displaced secondary vertices [78]. These b-tagged jets are reconstructed in the region |\u03b7| < 2.5 and have p T > 30 GeV. The btagging working point provides an efficiency of 77% for jets containing b-hadrons in simulated tt events, with rejection rates of 110 and 4.9 for light-flavour jets and jets containing c-hadrons, respectively [79].",

The likelihood is maximised by adjusting the normalisation and nuisance parameters. The extrapolation of the adjusted normalisation and nuisance parameters to the signal regions is checked in validation regions (VR), as defined below, which kinematically resemble the signal regions but are expected to have less signal. The VRs do not overlap with the CRs or SRs.Subdominant background processes, such as Z +jets, diboson and multiboson, tt +V , tt +h and V h, which have no dedicated control regions, are normalised to the cross-sections indicated in",
