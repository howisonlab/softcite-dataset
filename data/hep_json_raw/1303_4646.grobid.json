It instruments the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5 of the proton-proton (pp) collisions with a dipole magnet and a tracking system that achieves a momentum resolution of 0.4-0.6% in the range 5-100 GeV/c. The dipole magnet can be operated in either polarity and this feature is used to reduce systematic effects due to detector asymmetries. In 2011, 58% of the data were taken with one polarity, 42% with the other. The pp collisions take place inside a silicon microstrip vertex detector that provides clear separation of secondary B \u00b1 vertices from the primary collision vertex (PV) as well as discrimination for tertiary D vertices.

It accepts high transverse energy clusters in either an electromagnetic or hadron calorimeter, or a muon of high momentum transverse to the beam line (p T ). For this analysis, it is required that either one of the five tracks forming the B \u00b1 candidate points at a cluster in the hadron calorimeter, or that the hardware-trigger decision was taken independently of any of these tracks. A subsequent trigger level, implemented entirely in software, receives events at a rate of 1 MHz and retains \u223c 0.3% of them. At least one track should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and impact parameter (IP) \u03c7 2 with respect to the PV greater than 16. The IP \u03c7 2 is defined as the difference between the \u03c7 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered track. In order to maximise efficiency at an acceptable trigger rate, a displaced vertex is selected with a decision tree algorithm that uses flight distance as well as fit quality, p T and information on the IP with respect to the PV of the tracks. More information can be found in Ref. [16]. Full event reconstruction occurs offline, and a loose selection is run to reduce the size of the sample prior to final analysis. This selection consists of a decision tree algorithm similar to that used in the trigger, but in this case the entire decay chain is fully reconstructed and the selection benefits from the improved quality of the offline reconstruction.",

The probabilistic interpretation of the \u03c7 2 at each value of r K B is evaluated by generating and fitting a large number (10 7 ) of pseudo-datasets around the local minimum. The variation of the pseudo-datasets is derived from the covariance matrix of the principal result. At a given fixed point in the r K B range, a, with a value of \u03c7 2 a above the global minimum, the probability of obtaining the observed result is defined as the number of pseudo-experiments with \u03c7 2 \u03c7 2 a .
