            "text": "We report on measurements of dielectron (e + e \u2212 ) production in Au+Au collisions at a centerof-mass energy of 200 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair using the STAR detector at RHIC. Systematic measurements of the dielectron yield as a function of transverse momentum (pT) and collision centrality show an enhancement compared to a cocktail simulation of hadronic sources in the low invariant-mass region (Mee < 1 GeV/c 2 ). This enhancement cannot be reproduced by the \u03c1-meson vacuum spectral function. In minimum-bias collisions, in the invariant-mass range of 0.30 \u2212 0.76 GeV/c 2 , integrated over the full pT acceptance, the enhancement factor is 1.76 \u00b1 0.06 (stat.) \u00b1 0.26 (sys.) \u00b1 0.29 (cocktail). The enhancement factor exhibits weak centrality and pT dependence in STAR's accessible kinematic regions, while the excess yield in this invariantmass region as a function of the number of participating nucleons follows a power-law shape with a power of 1.44 \u00b1 0.10. Models that assume an in-medium broadening of the \u03c1 meson spectral function consistently describe the observed excess in these measurements. Additionally, we report on measurements of \u03c9 and \u03c6-meson production through their e + e \u2212 decay channel. These measurements show good agreement with Tsallis Blast-Wave model predictions as well as, in the case of the \u03c6-meson, results through its K + K \u2212 decay channel. In the intermediate invariant-mass region (1.1< Mee < 3 GeV/c 2 ), we investigate the spectral shapes from different collision centralities.",

Theoretical calculations indicate that at top RHIC energy, QGP thermal dilepton production will become a dominant source in the IMR while thermal dileptons with higher masses originate from earlier stages [3]. This suggests that investigating the thermal dilepton production as a function of M ll & p T allows for probing the medium properties at different stages of the system's space-time evolution. Measuring thermal dilepton collective flow and polarization can reveal information about the relevant degrees of freedom which may relate to deconfinement and the equilibrium of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions [4][5][6][7][8]. Thermal radiation can produce real photons as well as virtual photons that decay to dileptons. Comparative analysis of distributions for these dileptons with respect to those produced in initial hard scattering, can shed light on direct real photon production from the QGP medium.",

They are expected to dominate the LMR and their mass spectra may be related to the chiral symmetry restoration in the medium [2,9]. Theoretical calculations suggest that the vector meson spectral functions will undergo modifications in a hot and dense hadronic medium, which may be connected to the restoration of chiral symmetry. Two scenarios have been proposed for the change of vector meson spectral functions when chiral symmetry is restored: a shift of the pole mass [10] and/or a broadening of the mass spectrum [11]. Measurements of the dielectron continuum in the low mass region will help expose the vector meson production mechanisms, and hence the chiral properties of the medium in heavy-ion collisions.",

The CERES measurements of e + e \u2212 spectra in Pb+Au collisions at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) showed an enhancement in the mass region below \u223c700 MeV/c 2 with respect to the hadron cocktail that included the vacuum line shape for the \u03c1 meson [15]. High-statistics measurements from the NA60 experiment at \u221a s NN = 17.2 GeV suggested that this enhancement is consistent with in-medium broadening of the \u03c1-meson spectral function rather than a drop of its pole mass [16,[18][19][20][21]. Strikingly, after removal of correlated charm contributions, the NA60 collaboration also observed that the slope parameters of the dimuon transverse mass (m T ) spectrum showed a roughly linear increase with dimuon invariant mass below the \u03c6-meson mass, followed by a sudden decline at higher masses. This observation provided a first indication of thermal leptons from a partonic source [16].",

The PHENIX collaboration has measured dielectrons at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions within its detector acceptance. For minimum-bias collisions, in the mass region between 150 and 700 MeV/c 2 an enhancement of 4.7 \u00b1 0.4 (stat.) \u00b1 1.5 (syst.) \u00b1 0.9 (model) has been reported by the PHENIX collaboration [17]. Several theoretical calculations, which have successfully explained the SPS data [18][19][20][21] and the STAR data [22] previously, were unable to reproduce the magnitude of the low mass dielectron enhancement observed by PHENIX through expected vector meson contributions in the hadronic medium. The PHENIX measured IMR yields are consistent with the charm contribution from p + p scaled with the number of binary collisions. However, within the limits of the data precision and our present understanding of the modification of charmed hadron production in Au + Au collisions, no conclusive evidence for thermal radiation can be inferred from this measurement. A detailed dilepton program to investigate the in-medium chiral and thermal properties is one of the main focuses of future heavy-ion projects from Schwerionen Synchrotron (SIS) energies up to LHC energies.",

Furthermore, the dependence of dN/d\u03b7 on the collision vertex position V z and the beam luminosity has been included in order to take acceptance and efficiency changes on the measured dN/d\u03b7 into account. The measured uncorrected dN/d\u03b7 distribution from Au+Au 200 GeV minimum-bias events collected in year 2010 is shown in Fig. 1. The dN/d\u03b7 distributions are from the V z region of \u22125 < V z < 5 cm and extrapolated to a zero ZDCcoincidence rate, so as to correct for the detector acceptance and efficiency dependence on the V z and luminosity. The measured distribution matches the MC Glauber calculation well for dN/d\u03b7 > 100. In the lower multiplicity region, the VPD trigger becomes less efficient. The bottom panel shows the ratio between MC and measured data. The centrality bins are defined according to the MC Glauber distribution in order to determine the centrality cut on the measured dN/d\u03b7.

In order to make the mixed-event distributions close to that from real events, we have only selected events with similar properties for the mixed-event calculation. The full sample is divided into different pools according to the following event level properties: multiplicity, vertex position, event plane angle, and magnetic field direction. The sorting by event multiplicity and vertex position ensures electrons are mixed between events with similar detector acceptance and efficiency. This technique has been widely used in many other STAR analyses for the reconstruction of the combinatorial backgrounds [29]. The small signal-to-background ratio re- quires a very good understanding of the mixed-event distribution in the dielectron analysis. Its dependence on the event pool division for event-plane angle and magnetic field direction were studied in detail and are presented here. Elliptic flow measurements [30] in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions have shown that the momentum phase space distribution of particles produced in the event is approximately elliptical. Therefore, we only mix events with similar event-plane direction to ensure the events have similar momentum phase space alignment, and further guaranteed by the multiplicity assortment to ensure the events have similar momentum phase space distributions. The event plane was reconstructed with a conventional method using tracks in the TPC (0.1 < p T < 2 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 1) in order to obtain the second-order event-plane angle \u03a8 [30]. In Fig. 10 panel (a) and (b), results of a study using minimum bias Au+Au collisions in which mixed-event unlike-sign and like-sign distributions are compared using different numbers of event pools in event-plane angle are shown. The figure illustrates several scenarios from 1 up to 24 event pools. The dashed lines at \u00b10.5% corresponds to a 100% change in the yield where the signal-to-background ratio is 1/200. This study shows the importance of doing the division in event-plane angle in order to avoid distortion of the mixed-event distributions. The distortion is quite clear in the low mass region (< 1 GeV/c 2 ) and not negligible in the intermediate mass region (1\u22123 GeV/c 2 ). The differences become negligible when the number of event pools is 12 in 200 GeV Au+Au minimum-bias collisions, comparable to the TPC 2 nd order event plane resolution (0.72 for minimum bias Au+Au 200 GeV collisions) [7].",

In this MC simulation, virtual photons were put in according to cocktail (p T , M ee ) distributions and then converted into dielectrons. STAR acceptance was included for reconstructed electrons. The input v 2 values were taken from the STAR published result for charged pions [7]. The reconstructed event plane direction was smeared with a Gaussian distribution according to the realistic event plane resolution measured by STAR which is 0.72 for minimum bias collisions, corresponding to a width of about 20 deg. We then reconstructed full mixed-event distributions using different number of bins in the event plane category. Panel (c) and (d) in Fig. 10 show the results of the ratios between different mixed-event distributions using different number of bins based on this MC simulation. The simulations reproduce the features observed in data and illustrate that the choice of 12 bins in minimum-bias events is appropriate with expected event plane resolution and v 2 values.",

The J/\u03c8 contribution is not considered as a component of the bulk medium. The cocktail input for J/\u03c8 was taken from the measurement by the PHENIX collaboration [38]. For light hadrons, the TBW functions provide good parameterizations to these measured spectra. For those hadron cocktail components without corresponding direct measurements (e.g. low p T \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03c9), we use the same core TBW parameters obtained from the fit and predict the spectral shapes for each of these unknown components, shown as solid curves in Fig. 25. The low p T \u03b7 spectrum was fixed by requiring the match with the measured data points at p T > 2 GeV/c, while the dN/dy of \u03b7 \u2032 meson was taken with the same values as used in the PHENIX publication [17]. The same set of TBW parameters from the simultaneous fit were used to generate the \u03c9 spectrum and the dN/dy was tuned to match our dielectron yield in the \u03c9 peak region.",

The measured pion yields were calculated in the rapidity window of |y| < 0.1 in Ref. [33] and |y| < 0.5 in Ref. [34]. We used the pion rapidity distributions from the Hijing calculations and scaled the measured pion yields down by 3% to obtain the p T spectrum in the rapidity window of |y| < 1. This correction factor was also included in the uncertainty of the input \u03c0 0 dN/dy. The different centrality windows matter when taking the minimum-bias data from PHENIX measurements, done in 0-92% centrality, and compare those to our results which are for 0-80% centrality.

This setting was tuned to match our measured charmed meson spectrum in p+p collisions [40]. The input charm-pair production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision was also taken from charm meson measurements [40,41]. We used the same PYTHIA setting to calculate the dielectron yields from correlated bottom decays and from the Drell-Yan production. The input bottom and Drell-Yan production cross sections are: \u03c3 bb pp = 3.7 \u00b5b, \u03c3 DY pp = 42 nb. The \u03c1 meson contribution is expected to be modified due to a strong coupling to the hot QCD medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, the \u03c1 meson was not included in our default cocktail calculations. In the taneous TBW fit to the measured data points and the TBW predictions for \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , and \u03c9 with the same set of fit parameters.

As a conservative estimation, we  took the sum of each individual component as the total systematic uncertainty. For the reported dielectron yields in the STAR acceptance, the systematic uncertainty due to the efficiency correction includes uncertainties on the single-track efficiency, the pair efficiency evaluation method, and the pair cut (\u03c6 V ) efficiency. Table V summarizes each individual component and their contributions to the total uncertainty of the single-track efficiency. The individual component contributions were determined by varying track selection cuts and comparing distributions between data and MC for the uncertainty on the TPC tracking efficiency (nHitsFits, DCA, etc.). The uncertainties on the TOF matching efficiency, the TOF PID cut efficiency, and the ndEdxFits cut efficiency were evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the pure electron samples from photon conversion and \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay. The difference between a realistic function fit and direct counting methods of the TOF 1/\u03b2 distribution was also included in the uncertainty of the TOF PID cut efficiency. The electron pair efficiency evaluated from single tracks was described in Section III-F.2. Due to the unknown relative contributions between the correlated charm decays and the medium contribution, two extreme calculations were used as conservative estimates for the systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is mostly constrained to the intermediate and high mass regions of the mass spectrum and ranges from about 3% at low p T down to 1% at high p T . The systematic uncertainty of the \u03c6 V pair cut efficiency was evaluated by taking the difference between the calculations from the \u03c0 0 embedding sample and the virtual photon decay sample, which is about 3% at M ee < 0.05 GeV/c 2 . The systematic uncertainty of the pair efficiency due to different methods is 5%. Finally the total systematic uncertainty of the electron pair efficiency is \u223c 13%. ",

Restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry will lead to modification of the vector meson (short-lived \u03c1 meson in particular) spectral functions, which are accessible via dilepton measurements. There are two chiral symmetry restoration scenarios commonly used in calculations: (a)the drop of the pole mass or degeneracy of vector and axial-vector mesons due to the reduced qq condensate [10]; and (b) broadening of the spectral function due to many body collisions in the vector-meson dominance [2,11,47]. Both scenarios will introduce an enhancement in the mass region below the \u03c1 mass compared to the spectral function in vacuum. Precision measurement from the NA60 experiment demonstrated that the broadened \u03c1 scenario can reproduce the low mass dilepton enhancement data at SPS energy [16], while the dropping mass scenario failed to describe the data. It is anticipated that the hadronic medium at top RHIC energy is similar to that created at SPS energy, thus the dilepton production in the LMR region are comparable between SPS and RHIC.",

We chose the Parton-Hadron String Dynamic (PHSD) covariant transport model from this category when comparing to our data in the following sections. The PHSD transport approach incorporates the relevant off-massshell dynamics of the vector mesons and an explicit partonic phase in line with the lattice QCD equation of state in the early hot and dense reaction region as well as the dynamics of hadronization [53]. It allows for a microscopic study of the various dilepton production channels in non-equilibrium matter. In the hadronic sector, PHSD is equivalent to the HSD transport approach that has been used for the description of p+A and A+A collisions from SIS to RHIC energies. It reproduces fairly well the measured hadron yields, rapidity distributions, and transverse momentum spectra [54]. The dilepton radiation by the constituents of the strongly interacting QGP is produced via: (i) basic Born q +q annihilation, (ii) gluon Compton scattering (q/q + g \u2192 \u03b3 * + q/q), and (iii) quark/anti-quark annihilation with the gluon bremsstrahlung in the final state (q +q \u2192 g + \u03b3 * ). Dilepton production in these partonic channels is calculated with off-mass-shell partons using a phenomenological parametrization for the quark and gluon propagators in the QGP.",

The N part -scaled spectra are plotted in the upper panel, and the ratio between them is plotted in the bottom panel. The measured ratio is consistent with unity in the \u03c0 0 invariant mass region, indicating that the production scales with N part . The ratio starts to increase in the mass around 0.5\u22121.0 GeV/c 2 . This observation is consistent with a picture in which the correlated charm contribution starts to be a dominant source in this mass region while charm quark production at RHIC is expected to rather scale with N bin . Additionally, in this invariant mass range the in-medium \u03c1 meson contribution from the hadronic medium is expected to increase faster than N part when moving towards central collisions based on model calculations [52]. In the IMR, the data indicate there is potentially a systematic change in the mass spectra when comparing the minimum-bias and central collisions. This is suggestive of a possible modification of charmed hadron production or other contributions such as thermal radiation. To quantify the difference, exponential fits were performed to the mass spectra in central and minimum-bias collisions and the resulting exponential slopes differ by \u223c1.5\u03c3. We subtracted the cocktail contribution from the measured dielecton mass spectrum to obtain the direct excess yields, shown in Fig. 35 for the mass region of 0.3-1.4 GeV/c 2 . The cocktail simulations used in the subtraction include the correlated charm contributions from Pythia assuming the N bin scaling. A possible charm de-correlation leads to a negligible modification of the cocktail spectra in the mass region around 0.5 GeV/c 2 as shown in Fig. 34. The obtained excess spectra in Au+Au minimum-bias collisions are compared to model calculations in Fig. 35.",

Figure 39 shows the invariant mass distributions of the vector mesons \u03c9 and \u03c6 from \u221a s NN = 200 GeV Au+Au minimum-bias collisions. The signal spectra are reconstructed by subtracting the normalized mixed-event unlike-sign background (Section III-E3) from the inclusive same-event unlike-sign e + e \u2212 distribution. A Breit-Wigner function plus a second order polynomial function are used to fit the invariant mass distributions. The second order polynomial function is used to describe the residual background. In addition, we use the vector meson \u03c9(\u03c6) invariant mass distributions (lineshapes) directly from cocktail simulations (Breit-Wigner plus Gaussian functions) to fit the signal. As described in Section III-G, the detector momentum resolution in the cocktail simulation was estimated by tuning the simulation to match the J/\u03c8 signals in the data. The line shapes from this tuned simulation for the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons reproduce the signal well. The difference between these two methods is included in the systematic uncertainty of the raw yield. Figure 40 shows the \u03c9 and \u03c6 invariant mass distributions in different p T regions.",

The observed signal widths and mass positions are well reproduced in Monte Carlo simulations. The measured \u03c6 invariant yield spectrum through the e + e \u2212 decay channel is consistent with the previously published STAR measurement based on the K + K \u2212 decay channel. The \u03c9 invariant yield spectrum can be well reproduced by Tsallis Blast-Wave model predictions which use the same set of parameters obtained from a simultaneous fit to all other available light hadrons. This indicates that the \u03c9 mesons behave much like the bulk medium, with similar radial flow velocity.",

We reported the inclusive dielectron yields which include the contribution from correlated charm decays. However, at this time we do not know the characteristics of the charm contribution in Au+Au collisions. The dielectron data from 0-80% minimum-bias collisions can be fairly well described by the number-of-binary-collisions scaled p+p contribution based on Pythia calculations. The ratio between the central and minimum-bias spectra in the mass region of 1- 3 GeV/c 2 shows a moderate deviation from the N bin scaling (1.8\u03c3 deviation for the data point at 1.8-2.8 GeV/c 2 ). This could be indicative of the modification of the correlated charm contribution or the existence of other contributing sources in Au+Au collisions. The difference in the mass region 1-3 GeV/c 2 , if confirmed in future measurements with a better precision, would constrain the magnitude of the de-correlating effect on charm pairs while traversing the QCD medium and/or other possible dielectron sources, e.g., QGP thermal radiation, from central Au+Au collisions at RHIC.",

To investigate the impact of the detector acceptance effect on the final dielectron mass spectrum, we tried to narrow down the single-track acceptance cut to match the PHENIX acceptance as best as possible. We acknowledge that fully reproducing another experiment's acceptance is virtually impossible due to subtle differences in detector structures and performances. Instead, the STAR data is selected with the PHENIX azimuthal angle acceptance cut. Due to the limited statistics, we cannot further reduce the pseudorapidity window to match the respective PHENIX range. In addition, we also expect the physics is not significantly different between |\u03b7| < 0.35 and |\u03b7| < 1 rapidity ranges for 200 GeV collisions.",
