            "text": "Charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via H \u00b1 \u2192 tb are searched for in proton-proton collisions measured with the ATLAS experiment at \u221a s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark, gb \u2192 tH \u00b1 , is explored in the mass range 200 to 600 GeV using multi-jet final states with one electron or muon. In order to separate the signal from the Standard Model background, analysis techniques combining several kinematic variables are employed. An excess of events above the backgroundonly hypothesis is observed across a wide mass range, amounting to up to 2.4 standard deviations. Upper limits are set on the gb \u2192 tH \u00b1 production cross section times the branching fraction BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 tb). Additionally, the complementary s-channel production, qq \u2192 H \u00b1 , is investigated through a reinterpretation of W \u2192 tb searches in ATLAS. Final states with one electron or muon are relevant for H \u00b1 masses from 0.4 to 2.0 TeV, whereas the all-hadronic final state covers the range 1.5 to 3.0 TeV. In these search channels, no significant excesses from the predictions of the Standard Model are observed, and upper limits are placed on the qq \u2192 H \u00b1 production cross section times the branching fraction BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 tb).",

GeV [3], raises the question of whether this new particle is the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM) or one physical state of an extended Higgs sector. The observation of a heavy charged scalar particle would clearly indicate physics beyond the SM. Charged Higgs bosons 1 are predicted by several non-minimal Higgs scenarios, such as two-Higgs-doublet Models (2HDM) [4] and models containing Higgs triplets [5][6][7][8][9].",

            "text": "The production mechanisms and decay modes of a charged Higgs boson depend on its mass, m H + . For light charged Higgs bosons (m H + m top , where m top is the topquark mass), the primary production mechanism is through the decay of a top quark, t \u2192 bH + . For m H + > m top , the dominant H + production mode at the LHC is expected to be in association with a top quark, as illustrated by the left-hand and central plots of figure 1. When calculating the corresponding cross section in a four-flavour scheme (4FS), b-quarks are dynamically produced, whereas in a five-flavour scheme (5FS), the bquark is also considered as an active flavour inside the proton. The 4FS and 5FS cross sections are averaged according to ref. [10]. In the 2HDM, the production and decay of the charged Higgs boson also depend on the parameter tan \u03b2, defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and the mixing angle \u03b1 between the CP-even Higgs bosons. For m H + > m top and in the case of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2248 0, the dominant decay is H + \u2192 tb, with a substantial contribution from H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd for large values of tan \u03b2 [11]. A complementary H + production mode, shown in the right-hand plot of figure 1, is the s-channel process, qq \u2192 H + .",

            "text": "The LEP experiments placed upper limits on the production of H + in the mass range of 40-100 GeV [12], and the Tevatron experiments set upper limits on BR(t \u2192 bH + ) for m H + in the range 80-150 GeV [13,14]. The D0 experiment also searched for a charged Higgs boson with a mass in the range 180-300 GeV using the H + \u2192 tb decay channel [15]. Light charged Higgs bosons have been searched for in the \u03c4 \u03bd decay mode at the LHC by CMS (2 fb \u22121 , \u221a s = 7 TeV [16]) and ATLAS (4.7 fb \u22121 , \u221a s = 7 TeV [17,18]). Searches for charged Higgs bosons were also performed in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, by ATLAS using the \u03c4 \u03bd decay mode [19] and by CMS using final states originating from both the \u03c4 \u03bd and tb decay modes [20]. CMS set an upper limit of 2.0-0.13 pb on the production cross section times branching fraction for H + \u2192 tb in the mass range 180-600 GeV. Vector-boson-fusion H + production was also searched for by ATLAS using the W Z final state [21]. No evidence for a charged Higgs boson was found in any of these searches. This paper describes searches for charged Higgs bosons decaying into tb. In the H + mass range of 200-600 GeV, the production mode in association with a top quark is studied. The 5FS process is generated. Cross sections averaging 4FS and 5FS are used for model-dependent predictions. The search is based on selecting two top quarks, with their decays producing one charged lepton (electron or muon), and at least one additional jet containing a b-flavoured hadron. In the complementary s-channel production mode, H + masses between 0.4 and 2.0 TeV are explored in a final state containing one charged lepton and jets (referred to as lepton+jets in the following), while the all-hadronic final state is JHEP03(2016)127 used for very high H + masses, 1.5 to 3.0 TeV, with a jet substructure technique to reconstruct the top-quark decay products in one single large-radius jet. The two s-channel analyses are reinterpretations of recent searches for W \u2192 tb in ATLAS [22,23]. Based on dedicated simulations of the H + \u2192 tb signal and a reinterpretation of the data, upper limits are derived for the s-channel production of a charged scalar particle decaying to tb.",

[45]. Events are labelled as tt+bb if they contain at least one particle jet that is matched to a b-flavoured hadron not originating from the decay of the tt system. Events where at least one particle jet is matched to a c-flavoured hadron, and not already labelled as tt+bb, are labelled as tt+cc. Events labelled as either tt+bb or tt+cc are generically referred to as tt+heavy-flavour (HF) events. The remaining events, including those with no additional jets, are labelled as tt+light-flavour (LF). In the following, a sequential reweighting is applied at the generator level for all tt+LF and tt+cc events produced with Powheg+Pythia. Two correction factors are used, based on the values of the transverse momenta of the top quark and the tt system, taking the correlation between these two parameters into account. This reweighting procedure was originally implemented in order to match simulation to data in the measurement of top-quark-pair differential cross sections at \u221a s = 7 TeV [46]. It was verified that this procedure is also reasonable at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

Large-radius jets are used as input to the top-tagger. In order to minimise the effects of pile-up [89], the large-radius jets are trimmed [90]. The trimming is performed by reclustering the large-radius jet using the inclusive k t algorithm [91] with a jet radius parameter R = 0.3, and by removing soft subjets with a p T smaller than 5% of the original jet p T . Trimmed large-radius jets are required to have p T > 350 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. Large-radius jets are top-tagged if they have a substructure compatible with a three-prong decay. The top-tagger used in the search of section 5.2 was developed for the search for W \u2192 tb in ATLAS [23]. It uses the k t splitting scale [91] \u221a d 12 and the N -subjettiness [92,93] variables \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 32 . The k t algorithm clusters the hardest objects last, which means that a two-body decay (such as t \u2192 bW ) typically gets a larger value of \u221a d 12 than light jets. The \u03c4 ij distribution peaks closer to 0 for i-subjet-like jets and closer to 1 for j-subjet-like jets. The top-tagged jet is required to pass the cuts \u221a d 12 > 40 GeV, \u03c4 32 < 0.65, and 0.4 < \u03c4 21 < 0.9, as in the search for W \u2192 tb [23].",

The systematic uncertainties associated with the electron or muon selection arise from the trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiency, isolation criteria, as well as from the momentum scale and resolution [80,81]. In total, the systematic uncertainties associated with electrons (muons) include five (six) components. The systematic uncertainties associated with the jet selection arise from the jet energy scale (JES), the JVF requirement, the jet energy resolution and the jet reconstruction efficiency. Among these, the JES uncertainty has the largest impact on the search.  data, LHC collision data and simulation [85]. The JES uncertainty is split into 22 uncorrelated sources, which can have different jet p T -and \u03b7-dependencies. Six (four) independent sources of systematic uncertainty affecting the b(c)-tagging efficiency are considered [88]. An additional uncertainty is assigned due to the extrapolation of the measurement of the b-tagging efficiency to the high-p T region. Twelve uncertainties are considered for the light-jet mistagging rate, with dependencies on the jet p T and \u03b7.",

An uncertainty of +5%/\u22124% is assumed for the cross section of single-top-quark production [56,57], corresponding to the weighted average of the theoretical uncertainties on the s-, t-and W t-channel production modes. One additional systematic uncertainty is considered to account for different ways of handling the interference between tt and W t events [55]. For ttV , an uncertainty of 30% on the cross section is assumed [52,53] and an additional uncertainty arises from variations in the amount of radiation. The uncertainty on the ttH cross section is +8.9%/\u221212% [11]. The uncertainties on the V +jets and diboson backgrounds are 48% and 25%, respectively [63,68]. For events with 5 (\u22656 jets), one (two) additional uncertainties of 24% are added in quadrature to account for the extrapolation to higher jet multiplicities. In addition, the full difference between applying and not applying the p T reweighting for the vector boson is taken as a systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties on the estimate of the multi-jet background come from the limited number of events in the data, especially at high jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities, from the uncertainties on the measured lepton misidentification rates (assumed to be 50%, but uncorrelated between events with an electron or muon), as well as from the subtraction of simulated events with a prompt lepton when estimating the misidentification rates.",

The uncertainties observed across the charged Higgs boson mass range are of the order of 5-10% and increase slightly with the H + mass. This systematic uncertainty affects both shape and normalisation. Uncertainties from the choice of the event generator are estimated from a comparison of the signal acceptances between events produced using either Powheg or Madgraph5 aMC@NLO v2.1.1 [106], both interfaced to Pythia v8.1, with a charged Higgs boson mass of 400 GeV. In the SR, this uncertainty is found to be about 1%, while it increases to as much as 20% in the CR. It is applied to all signal mass points as a normalisation-only systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties originating from initial-and final-state parton radiation, which can modify the jet production rate, are evaluated by varying factorisation/renormalisation scale parameters in the production of signal samples.

A systematic background mismodelling is considerably more likely to give rise to the observed excess than a hypothesised signal at a specific mass. The cross sections of the tt+HF backgrounds and the shape of the tt+bb component have large uncertainties which are correlated with the signal normalisation. Together with the pre-fit excess of data compared to the SM prediction (table 1), this can result in a post-fit excess over a wide H + mass range. The fits were repeated using two alternative, less sensitive, discriminants in the SR: (a) a BDT trained against the sum of all backgrounds or (b) the variable H had T . Similar excesses were observed with these two alternative methods.

Exactly one charged lepton is required, which must match, with \u2206R < 0.15, a lepton reconstructed by the trigger. The electron or muon is then required to have E T or p T greater than 30 GeV. The selected events must then have two or three jets, with exactly two of them b-tagged. In addition, the E miss T must exceed 35 GeV, and the sum E miss T + m T , where m T is the transverse mass 6 of the W boson, is required to be greater than 60 GeV in order to reduce the contribution from the multi-jet background. Assuming that the missing transverse momentum arises solely from the neutrino in the W -boson decay, its transverse momentum is given by the xand y-components of the E miss T vector, while the unmeasured z-component of the neutrino momentum p \u03bd z is inferred by imposing the W -boson mass constraint on the lepton-neutrino system. This leads to a quadratic equation for p \u03bd z . In the case of two real solutions, the one with the smaller p \u03bd z is chosen. If the solutions are complex, a real estimate of the p \u03bd z is obtained by a kinematic fit that rescales the neutrino momentum components p \u03bd x and p \u03bd y such that the imaginary term vanishes. The corrected missing transverse momentum of the neutrino is kept as close as possible to the measured E miss T [110]. Having determined the four-momentum of the leptonically decaying W boson, the top quark is then reconstructed. The b-tagged jet for which the invariant mass of the W b system is closest to m top is assumed to originate from the top-quark decay, the other btagged jet being in turn assigned to the H + decay. The selected events are then classified into one signal-rich and one signal-depleted region, separately for events with two or three jets. The signal-rich region is the subset of the sample with two b-tagged jets and an invariant mass m tb > 330 GeV. The signal-depleted region is the complementary subset, with two b-tagged jets and m tb < 330 GeV.",

In the events with three jets, the contribution of the W +jets background remains below 10% and large uncertainties are obtained for the data-driven renormalisation factors, hence the W +jets process with three jets is treated in the same way as the other simulated backgrounds. BDT discriminators, using the TMVA toolkit [99], are again used to obtain the best separation between the H + \u2192 tb signal events and the associated SM backgrounds. The same BDT as in the search for W \u2192 tb [22] are used. These BDT were trained for a W mass of 1.75 TeV. Alternative trainings with H + samples were tested but no overall improvement of the expected sensitivity was found. In events with two (three) jets, ten (eleven) BDT input variables are used, of which m tb and the p T of the top-quark candidate are the most discriminating.

The selection and the statistical analysis are identical to those of the W \u2192 tb search [23]. Events with isolated charged leptons are vetoed in the event selection. Candidate events are first collected using the requirement that the scalar sum of E T for all energy deposits -19 - in the calorimeters exceeds 700 GeV at the trigger level. Then, the scalar sum of p T of all small-radius jets is required to be greater than 850 GeV. The selected events must contain exactly one top-tagged large-radius jet (reconstructed and identified using the procedure described in section 3) with p T > 350 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. A small-radius b-tagged jet, with p T > 350 GeV and a separation \u2206R > 2.0 from the top-tagged jet, is also required. The invariant mass of the top-tagged jet and the b-tagged jet, m tb , must exceed 1.1 TeV. The selected events are classified into two categories, one b-tag or two b-tags, depending on whether or not an additional small-radius b-tagged jet with p T > 25 GeV is found with a distance \u2206R < 1.0 from the top-tagged jet. The second b-tagged jet, if found, is used for classification only and does not enter the invariant mass calculation, to avoid double-counting of energy. The shape of the m tb distribution for the signal is estimated from a fit to simulated H + events. The appropriate functional form is found to be the same as in the search for W \u2192 tb: a skew-normal distribution convolved with a Gaussian function, to capture the asymmetric structure of the H + signal shape due to radiation, together with off-shell production [23]. The signal shapes are shown in figure 9.",

Hypothesis testing is performed using the CLs [108] procedure, with the log-likelihood ratio of the background-plus-signal and background-only hypotheses as the test statistic for both final states. Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters and are implemented in the same manner as in the searches for W \u2192 tb [22,23], with the exception of the uncertainty arising from the choice of the PDF in the signal modelling, since the colliding partons are mainly c-and squarks in the H + production. The PDF systematic uncertainties are estimated by taking the envelope of the MSTW2008 68% CL NLO, CT10 NLO and NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF sets in nominal H + signal events, reweighted using LHAPDF6 [111]. The dominant systematic uncertainty in the lepton+jets final state is the W +jets cross section normalisation, while for the all-hadronic final state, the b-tagging and background modelling uncertainties dominate. Figure 10 shows the expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of qq \u2192 H + \u2192 tb in the s-channel. For the lep- ton+jets (all-hadronic) final state and the charged Higgs boson mass range of 0.4-2.0 TeV (1.5-3.0 TeV), these observed upper limits lie between 0.13 and 6.7 pb (0.09 and 0.22 pb).",
