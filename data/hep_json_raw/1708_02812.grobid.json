The analysis is based on a data sample of protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The search is performed in the fully leptonic final state ZZ \u2192 , where , = e or \u03bc. The electroweak production of two Z bosons in association with two jets is measured with an observed (expected) significance of 2.7 (1.6) standard deviations. A fiducial cross section for the electroweak production is measured to be \u03c3 EW (pp \u2192 ZZjj \u2192 jj) = 0.40 +0.21    \u22120.16 (stat) +0.13   \u22120.09 (syst) fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings are determined in terms of the effective field theory operators T0, T1, T2, T8, and T9. This is the first measurement of vector boson scattering in the ZZ channel at the LHC.",

The discovery of a scalar boson at the CERN LHC [3,4] with gauge couplings compatible with those predicted for the SM Higgs boson [5] provides evidence that contributions from the exchange of this boson may be responsible for preserving unitarity at high energies, as predicted in the SM.",

            "text": "Unitarity restoration for longitudinal boson scattering in the SM relies on the interference of the VBS amplitudes and amplitudes that involve the Higgs boson. Any deviation in the SM coupling of the Higgs boson to the gauge bosons breaks this delicate cancellation, thus permitting a test of the EW symmetry breaking mechanism (EWSB) of the SM. The study of differential cross sections for VBS processes at large diboson invariant masses provides a modelindependent test of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons, complementing direct measurements of Higgs boson production E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. and decay rates. Many models of physics beyond the SM alter the couplings of vector bosons, and the effects can be parametrized in an effective field theory approach [6]. The VBS topology increases the sensitivity to the contribution of the quartic interactions, allowing tests for the presence of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs) [7].",

            "text": "interact. Because of the relatively small transverse momentum p T carried by the gauge bosons and the absence of any color exchange at leading order (LO), VBS is characterized by the presence of two forward jets j in addition to the outgoing gauge bosons (qq \u2192 VVjj) and little hadronic activity between the two jets [8,9]. The hard interaction in VBS only involves the EW interaction. Fig. 1 shows some of the Feynman diagrams that contribute to the EW production of the VVjj signature, involving quartic (top left) and trilinear vertices (top right), as well as diagrams involving the Higgs boson (bottom left). The qq \u2192 VVjj process can also be mediated through the strong interaction (bottom right in Fig. 1), which leads to the same final state as the VBS signal, resulting in an irreducible background. Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations performed searches for VBS using proton-proton collisions at  ported limits on a fiducial cross section for VBS in the WZ channel [13]. The ZZ channel remained unprobed. Limits on aQGCs are reported in Refs. [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This paper presents the first experimental investigation of VBS in the ZZ channel and exploits the fully leptonic final state, where both Z bosons decay into electrons or muons, ZZ \u2192 ( , = e or \u03bc). Despite a low cross section, a small Z \u2192 branching fraction, and a large irreducible QCD background, this channel provides a favorable laboratory to study EWSB because all final-state particles are reconstructed. The clean leptonic final state results in a small reducible background, where one or more of the reconstructed lepton candidates originate from the misidentification of jet fragments. This channel also provides a precise knowledge of the scattering energy. Furthermore, the spin correlations of the reconstructed fermions permit the extraction of the longitudinal contribution to VBS.",

The electron momentum scale for data is corrected with a Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 sample by matching the peak of the reconstructed dielectron mass spectrum to the known value of m Z . A Gaussian smearing of the electron energies in the simulation is also applied to match the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 mass resolution in data. Muon momenta are calibrated using a Kalman filter approach [40], using J/\u03c8 meson and Z boson decays. An algorithm is used to identify final-state radiation (FSR) from the leptons [41]. A photon with p T > 2 GeV and within a cone of R = 0.5 around the lepton momentum direction is selected if it satisfies quality requirements. The FSR photons identified by the algorithm are excluded from the lepton isolation computation. Jets are reconstructed from particle-flow candidates using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [37], as implemented in the FASTJET package [38], with a distance parameter of 0.4. In order to assure a good reconstruction efficiency and to reduce the instrumental background as well as the contamination from pileup, loose identification criteria based on the multiplicities and energy fractions carried by charged and neutral hadrons are imposed on jets [42].",

The impact of the jet energy scale uncertainty amounts to 20 (4)% at low (high) values of the multivariate discriminant and the impact of the jet energy resolution uncertainty is 8% [44,45]. The uncertainties in the QCD background normalization and the jet energy scale are the dominant systematic uncertainties in the measurement. Higher order EW corrections in VBS processes are known to be negative and at the level of tens of percent [47], but such corrections have not been calculated for the final state considered in this paper, and therefore are not considered here. Nevertheless, the impact of such NLO EW corrections would be negligible in this analysis, which is limited by the large statistical uncertainty. The uncertainty in the lepton reconstruction and selection efficiency is 6/4/2% in the 4e/2e2\u03bc/4\u03bc final states, respectively. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.5% [48]. The systematic uncertainty in the trigger efficiencies is evaluated by taking the difference between the trigger efficiencies measured in data and in simulated events, and amounts to 2%.

            "text": "As a consequence, the T8 and T9 operators are experimentally accessible only via final states involving the neutral gauge bosons. The effect of a nonzero aQGC is to enhance the production cross section at large masses of the ZZ system. Thus the m ZZ distribution is used to constrain the aQGC parameters f Ti / 4 . The increase of the yield exhibits a quadratic dependence on the anomalous coupling, and a parabolic function is fitted to the per-mass bin yields, allowing for an interpolation between the discrete coupling parameters of the simulated signals. The statistical analysis employs the same methodology used for the signal strength, including the profiling of the systematic uncertainties. The distributions of the background model, including the EW component, are normalized to their respective SM predictions. The Wald Gaussian approximation and Wilks' theorem are used to derive 95% confidence level (CL) limits on the aQGC parameters [55][56][57]. The measurement is statistically limited. Fig. 4 shows the expected m ZZ distribution for the SM and two aQGC scenarios. Table 2 lists the individual lower and upper limits obtained by setting all other anomalous couplings to zero, as well as the unitarity bound. The unitarity bound is determined using the VBFNLO framework [58] as the scattering energy m ZZ at which the aQGC coupling strength set equal to the observed limit would result in a scattering amplitude that violates unitarity. These are the most stringent limits to date on the aQGC parameters f T0,1,2 / 4 and f T8,9 / 4 .",
