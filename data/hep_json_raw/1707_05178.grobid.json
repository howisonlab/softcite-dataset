To the lowest order in perturbation theory, the \u03b7 c decays through cc annihilation into two gluons. The \u03b7 c is then expected to have numerous hadronic decay modes into two-or three-body hadronic final states, and many of them have been measured [2]. However, the three-pion decay mode has not yet been studied, but its measurement is important to test isospin symmetry [3][4][5].",

For example, the BESIII experiment using J/\u03c8 radiative decays has performed a series of analyses on three pion decays [6][7][8][9][10][11], and for the first time reported the observation of the isospin violating decay \u03b7(1405) \u2192 3\u03c0 [12]. Of particular interest in \u03b7(1405) \u2192 3\u03c0 decay is a narrow structure around 0.98 GeV/c 2 in the \u03c0\u03c0 mass spectrum, identified with the f 0 (980), which can be interpreted under the triangle singularity scheme [13][14][15].",

Charged tracks must be in the active region of the MDC, corresponding to | cos \u03b8| < 0.93, where \u03b8 is the polar angle of the charged track with respect to the beam direction, and are required to pass within \u00b110 cm of the interaction point in the beam direction and 1 cm of the beam line in the plane perpendicular to the beam. Photon candidates must have minimum energies of 25 MeV in the EMC barrel (| cos \u03b8| < 0.8) or 50 MeV in the EMC end-caps (0.86 < | cos \u03b8| < 0.92). To eliminate photons radiated from charged particles, each photon must be separated by at least 10 \u2022 from any charged track. A requirement on the photon time, T DC, in the EMC, 0 \u2264 T DC \u2264 14 (50 ns/count), is used to suppress noise and energy deposits unrelated to the event. Events with two oppositely charged tracks and at least three photons are selected for further analysis. The two charged tracks are required to be identified as pions using the combined information of dE/dx from the MDC and the flight time from the TOF.",

If there are more than three photon candidates in an event, the combination with the smallest \u03c7 2 4C is retained, and \u03c7 2 4C is required to be less than 20. To sup-press the background events with two or four photons in the final states, 4C kinematic fits are also performed under the \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hypotheses, and \u03c7 2 4C is required to be less than the \u03c7 2 values of the \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hypotheses.

If more than one \u03b3\u03b3 combination satisfies this requirement, the one with M \u03b3\u03b3 closest to m \u03c0 0 is selected. To reject background events with an \u03b7 in the final state, we require that the invariant masses of the other two possible photon pairs are not within the \u03b7 mass region, |M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 m \u03b7 | > 0.02 GeV/c 2 , where m \u03b7 is the nominal \u03b7 mass [2].

We fit the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass distribution to determine the \u03c0 0 signal yields, and the \u03c0 0 efficiency is the ratio of the \u03c0 0 yields with and without the \u03c0 0 mass window requirement, where the \u03c0 0 yield is obtained by integrating the fitted signal shape.
