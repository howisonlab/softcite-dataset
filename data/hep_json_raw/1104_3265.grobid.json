Randrianarivony, 14  Dalitz decays [1], in which a virtual photon is internally converted to an e + e \u2212 pair, have been observed in several vector-to-pseudoscalar decays of light mesons (e.g., \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 , \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 , and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 ) [2]. However, such decays have not been reported in electromagnetic decays of mesons containing charm or bottom quarks. This paper reports the first observa The expected D * + s Dalitz decay rate may be calculated by treating the photon from D * + s \u2192 D + s \u03b3 as virtual and coupling it to an e + e \u2212 pair.

The CLEO-c detector is equipped with a CsI(Tl) calorimeter [5] to detect photons and determine their directions and energies, and two concentric cylindrical wire drift chambers [6] to track the trajectory of charged particles. The tracking chambers operate in an axial 1 T magnetic field to provide momentum measurements. The beam pipe and the drift chambers present under 2% of a radiation length of material, minimizing multiple scattering of charged particles and photon conversions. Charged hadron identification is achieved using energy loss (dE/dx) in the drift chambers and Cherenkov radiation in the RICH detector [7,8].",

For every track, the default reconstruction provides a separately computed momentum vector for each of three mass hypotheses, pion, kaon, and proton. The e \u00b1 tracks in this analysis are rather soft, with momenta below 150 MeV/c, where dE/dx is very different from that of any of those three hypothetical masses. Hence, the default reconstruction for e \u00b1 tracks is not very accurate. To improve sensitivity, we reprocess events containing at least one exclusively reconstructed D + s candidate, adding an electron mass hypothesis for each charged particle. Details of this analysis appear in Ref. [10].

Simulated samples of all e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (where q = u, d, s, or c) processes at 4.170 GeV are used for background. The reconstructed e + e \u2212 tracks are required to pass within 5 cm of the interaction point in the direction parallel to the beam axis and within 5 mm of the beam axis in the transverse directions. The dE/dx of each e \u00b1 candidate is required to be within 3\u03c3 of that expected for electrons. All charged pions and kaons in the D + s decay chain are identified as such using a combination of dE/dx and RICH information as described in Ref. [14]. We require the reconstructed D + s mass M Ds to be within a mode-dependent region around the known D + s mass [2] consistent with the resolution of the detector. We define the beamconstrained mass of the s e + e \u2212 signal events that were described above. The distributions of the two types of events in the \u2206\u03c6 0 -\u2206d 0 plane are quite different. No Monte Carlo truth was required for the tracks reconstructed in the conversion simulation, so these events include combinatorial background, as well as correctly reconstructed conversion events. To separate signal events from conversion events, we require \u2206d 0 > \u22125 mm and \u2206\u03c6 0 < 0.12. These additional requirements are very effective in reducing conversion backgrounds; they retain 81% of the simulated signal events, but only 11% of the simulated conversion events. We apply these selection criteria to simulated samples of our signal to obtain the selection efficiencies for signal events \u01eb i ee , where i stands for one of the nine decay modes of the D + s used in this analysis. We also apply these criteria to data to obtain the yields of signal events n i ee . These numbers are presented in Table I for each decay mode of the D + s . Having established selection criteria using simulations, the background b i ee in the signal region for each mode i is estimated from the fit of an M BC background function to the data in the M BC sidebands for that mode. The shape of the M BC function is fixed and is common to all modes. The function incorporates the kinematic limit and its parameters are determined from simulations. This shape is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). A similar estimate of b i ee obtained from the \u03b4M distribution and the difference between this estimate and the M BC estimate is taken as the systematic uncertainty inherent in the procedure. The estimated background for each mode is presented in Table I as b i ee . We calculate the signal significance, expressed in number of Gaussian standard deviations, from the Poisson probability for the estimated background to fluctuate up to the observed signal yield or higher. The uncertainties in the background, both statistical and systematic, are modeled as Gaussian distributions. The combined signal significance for all modes is 5.3\u03c3. The most significant individual mode is K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + at 5.0\u03c3. The distribution of the e + e \u2212 invariant mass M ee for the 51 observed events in the signal region is compared to that expected in our simulations and presented in Fig. 3.
