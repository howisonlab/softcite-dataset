A unitarity test of the first row of the CKM mixing matrix is obtained from the KLOE precision measurements of Kl3 widths for K \u00b1 , KL, and (unique to KLOE) KS, complemented with the absolute branching ratio for the K\u00b52 decay. KLOE results lead to constraints for NP models and can probe possible charged Higgs exchange contribution in SM extensions with two Higgs doublets. The main focus in the present document is set on a new measurement of RK = \u0393(Ke2)/\u0393(K\u00b52) with an accuracy at the % level, aiming at finding evidence of deviations from the SM prediction induced by lepton-flavor violation NP effects.",

In order to keep the statistical uncertainty on the number of K \u2192 e\u03bd counts below 1%, a \"direct search\" for K \u2192 e\u03bd and K \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd decays is performed, without tagging. Since the wanted observable is a ratio of BR's for two channels with similar topology and kinematics, one expects to benefit from some cancellation of the uncertainties on tracking, vertexing, and kinematic identification efficiencies. Small deviations in the efficiency due to the different masses of e's and \u00b5's will be evaluated using MC.",

The distribution of M 2 lep is shown in Fig. 2 for MC events before and after quality cuts are applied. The selection applied is enough for clean identification of a K \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd sample, while further rejection is needed in order to identify K \u2192 e\u03bd events: the background, which is dominated by badly reconstructed K \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd events, is \u223c10 times more frequent than the signal in the region around M 2 e . Information from the EMC is used to improve background rejection. To this purpose, we extrapolate the secondary track to the EMC surface and associate it to a nearby EMC cluster. For electrons, the associated cluster is close to the EMC surface and the cluster energy E cl is a measurement of the particle momentum p ext , so that E cl /p ext peaks around 1. For muons, clusters tend to be more in depth in the EMC and E cl /p ext tends to be smaller than 1, since only the kinetic energy is visible in the EMC. Electron clusters can also be distinguished from \u00b5 (or \u03c0) clusters, since electrons shower and deposit their energy mainly in the first plane of EMC, while muons behave like minimum ionizing particles in the first plane and deposit a sizable fraction of their kinetic energy from the third plane onward, when they are slowed down to rest (Bragg's peak), see left panel of Fig. 3. Particle identification has been therefore based on the asymmetry of energy deposits between the first and the next-to-first planes, on the spread of energy deposits on each plane, on the position of the plane with the maximum energy, and on the asymmetry of energy deposits between the last and the next-to-last planes. All information are combined with neural network (NN) trained on K L \u2192 \u03c0\u2113\u03bd data, taking into account variations of the EMC response with momentum and impact angle on the calorimeter. The distribution of  the NN output, NN, for an independent K L \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd sample is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 for data and Monte Carlo (MC). Additional separation has been obtained using time of flight information.",

In the fit region, a small fraction of K \u2192 e\u03bd(\u03b3) events is due to the direct-emission structure-dependent component (DE): the value of this contamination, f SD , is fixed in the fit to the expectation from simulation.This assumption has been evaluated by performing a dedicated measurement of SD, which yielded as a by-product a determination of f SD with a 4% accuracy. This implies a systematic error on K e2 counts of 0.2%, as obtained by repeating the fit with values of f SD varied within its uncertainty.",
