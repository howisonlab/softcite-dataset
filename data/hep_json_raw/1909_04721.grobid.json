            "text": "A search is performed for electroweak production of a vector-like top quark partner T of charge 2/3 in association with a top or bottom quark, using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The search targets T quarks over a wide range of masses and fractional widths, decaying to a top quark and either a Higgs boson or a Z boson in fully hadronic final states. The search is performed using two experimentally distinct signatures that depend on whether or not each quark from the decays of the top quark, Higgs boson, or Z boson produces an individual resolved jet. Jet substructure, b tagging, and kinematic variables are used to identify the top quark and boson jets, and also to suppress the standard model backgrounds. The data are found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross sections for T quark-mediated production of tHQq, tZQq, and their sum, where Q is the associated top or bottom heavy quark and q is another associated quark. The limits are given for each search signature for various T quark widths up to 30% of the T quark mass, and are between 2 pb and 20 fb for T quark masses in the range 0.6-2.6 TeV. These results are significantly more sensitive than prior searches for electroweak single production of T \u2192 tH and represent the first constraints on T \u2192 tZ using hadronic decays of the Z boson with this production mode.",

            "text": "We report on a search for electroweak production of a new heavy quark of charge 2/3 with nonchiral couplings, referred to as a vector-like quark. Unlike the standard model (SM) chiral fermions, such particles do not acquire their mass from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson (H). Many proposed extensions of the SM contain vector-like quarks, which usually mix with the top quark (t). Such particles could have a role in stabilizing the Higgs boson mass, and thus offer a potential solution to the hierarchy problem. Vector-like quarks are discussed in detail in refs. [1][2][3][4] and have been the subject of phenomenological studies in various frameworks including those of refs. [5][6][7][8]. Much like the top quark, a vector-like top quark partner (T) could be produced either in pairs, dominantly through the strong interaction, or singly, in association with additional quarks through the electroweak interaction. The T quark could couple to bW, tZ, or tH; this leads to the corresponding T quark decays and to the associated electroweak production from processes such as those depicted in figure 1. The branching fractions and dominant electroweak production processes depend on the particular model; many models have substantial branching fractions to tZ or tH resulting in signatures that are of primary relevance to this paper. Neglecting the corrections due to decay particle masses, the branching fractions for the T singlet model of ref. [5] are 50% (bW), 25% (tZ), 25% (tH), while for the (TB) doublet model of ref. [5], the tZ and tH branching fractions tend to be approximately equal and depend on two mixing angles, \u03b8 u R and \u03b8 d R , with each branching fraction ranging from zero to 50%. Therefore specific models can have branching fractions as large as 50% for tZ and 50% for tH.",

We use two searches that target separately lower and higher mass values for the T quark. Both searches are designed to be sensitive to the decay to a top quark and a Higgs boson (T \u2192 tH), and to the decay to a top quark and a Z boson (T \u2192 tZ) with subsequent hadronic decays of X (X = H, Z). Both also consider a wide range of widths of the T quark, ranging from narrow, defined as small compared to the experimental mass resolution, to as much as 30% of the T quark mass. The event selections primarily require b tagging for the Higgs and Z boson candidates and so are most sensitive to X \u2192 bb. The experimental signature is a resonant peak in the tX invariant mass spectrum.",

These are electroweak production modes, with the production of JHEP01(2020)036 only a single T, that rely on a nonzero TbW coupling for the charged-current production, and a nonzero TtZ coupling for the neutral-current production. In order to be produced with an observable cross section, one needs a substantial partial width for the coupling to the initial state. As a consequence, currently accessible production cross sections in electroweak single production are associated with particle widths exceeding about 5%, which would affect the experimentally observable invariant mass distributions. The total width could also be enlarged if additional decay modes were present.",

            "text": "Recent searches at the LHC for pair production of vector-like quarks have severely constrained the possible existence of lower-mass vector-like quarks that couple to heavy quarks [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. These searches use several final states arising from the bW, tZ, and tH decay channels and usually model pair production under the assumption of a narrow width. In particular, for the T singlet model, the most stringent expected lower mass limit from pair production to date is 1.2 TeV [16] at 95% confidence level (CL). Pair production is based on the assumed universal strong coupling and so the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) pair production cross sections are known and model independent, and depend only on the T quark mass, m T . On the other hand, electroweak production depends on the strength of the T quark coupling at the production vertex, either TbW or TtZ, and therefore the production cross sections are model dependent. In some models, such as that of ref. [2], the couplings are constrained by precision observables to be quite small. In other models, such as that of ref. [7], cross sections two orders of magnitude higher than in ref. [2] may be feasible. The first direct experimental constraints on electroweak production of vector-like quarks were published in ref. [19]. Search results at \u221a s = 13 TeV include the search already performed by CMS for electroweak production of T with T \u2192 tH for both semileptonically decaying top quarks and hadronically decaying top quarks using the 2015 data set [20,21]. Other results at \u221a s = 13 TeV targeting electroweak production of T are described in refs. [22,23] for T \u2192 bW, and for T \u2192 tZ with dielectron and dimuon decays of the Z in refs. [15,24,25], and using a missing energy signature for Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decays in ref. [26]. The search reported here uses the 2016 data set to study fully hadronic final states with both merged and resolved jets resulting from electroweak production of a T quark with T \u2192 tH and T \u2192 tZ. This search represents a significant advance over prior electroweak production searches for T \u2192 tH, with expected 95% CL cross section upper limits typically 5-10 times lower than those reported in ref. [21], and is competitive with other searches for T \u2192 tZ in this production mode.",

The jet multiplicity, correspondingly, is reduced.

Besides the primary motivation of exploring the possibility of electroweak production of a vector-like quark, this analysis can be viewed more broadly as two independent searches for high mass signatures of physics beyond the SM at the LHC. As such they provide potential for discovery of new physics, independent of the specific models discussed here. The paper is organized as follows: this section has given the motivation to search for the singly produced T quark with two distinct signatures and two decay modes. The CMS detector and event reconstruction are described in section 2. The data set and the modeling of signal and background processes are described in section 3. Reconstruction methods common to the two searches are discussed in section 4. The event selection criteria, background estimation, and results are described for the low-mass search in section 5, and for the high-mass search in section 6. Systematic uncertainties for both signatures are discussed in section 7. The overall results are presented in section 8 and summarized in section 9.",

The signal generation for these \"narrow width\" 2 \u2192 3 process samples has the width set to 10 GeV, which is small on the scale of the experimental resolution of about 6%. Separate samples were generated for both left-and right-handed chiralities of the T quark for each decay mode, for these narrow-width cases. In addition, MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.4.2 at leading order was used to simulate the large width 2 \u2192 4 processes, pp \u2192 tHbq, pp \u2192 tHtq, pp \u2192 tZbq and pp \u2192 tZtq, with fractional widths \u0393/m T of 10, 20, and 30%.

The benchmark T quark masses used for the results range from 0.6 to 2.6 TeV. The NNPDF3.0 parton distribution function (PDF) set [35] was used. The samples are generated with both the top quark and the Higgs boson decaying inclusively. The masses of the Higgs boson and top quark are set to 125 and 172.5 GeV, respectively.

However, the second part of the selection criteria tends to shape the five-jet invariant mass distribution. In order to evaluate the shape of the five-jet invariant mass distribution for the background in data, two regions that are independent from the main 3T signal region are defined using looser b tagging criteria. In these two regions it is important to ensure that no bias with respect to the selection criteria is present, as all backgrounds are estimated from data. The extraction of signal is done by fitting the signal and background simultaneously in all three regions. The b tagging does not strongly influence the kinematic distributions of objects used to construct the five-jet invariant mass. Therefore we relax the b tagging criteria required for three of the five jets forming the T candidate. The first new region is called the 3M signal region; it requires three medium b-tagged jets but excludes events with three tight b-tagged JHEP01 (2020)036jets, bringing information on the background and possible signal shapes. The second new region is denoted as the 2M 1L signal region; in order to have significant numbers of events in this background-dominated region and to keep events with similar kinematics to the 3T signal region, the b tagging criteria are relaxed to two medium and one loose b-tagged jets but excluding three medium b-tagged jets.",

Furthermore, the N -subjettiness algorithm [57] is used to further select jets with three or two substructures for the top quark jets, and the H and Z boson jets, respectively.

The systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 7. The predictions of the QCD multijet contributions, which include the overall effect of the shape and the normalization, have been validated using a fit that uses a different set of eight control regions in data. These control regions are mutually exclusive to the previously defined eight regions, contain larger numbers of events, and are defined using loose b tagging criteria on the t tag and the reversed-t tag in a sample that excludes events with forward (|\u03b7| > 2.4) jets. The double ratio is taken to be fully correlated between the tH and tZ regions, with a central value of 1.0, and an assigned uncertainty of 0.6. This uncertainty is assessed based on the measured double ratios from the relatively low number of events in the QCD multijet simulation.

The jet energy resolution in data is found to be worse than that in simulation, and the discrepancy is corrected by applying an extra smearing to the energy of jets in simulated events. Both the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties affect the overall scale and shapes of the invariant mass distributions.  The uncertainties in the H and Z jet mass scale and resolution and the N -subjettiness selection [61] affect the high-mass search. The jet mass scale, resolution, and the Nsubjettiness selection efficiency were measured in a sample of tt+jets events with one top quark decaying leptonically and the other top quark decaying hadronically (semileptonic tt+jets events). The hadronically decaying top quark is boosted enough to produce a merged W \u2192 qq jet separated from a b jet. The jet mass scale was evaluated to be unity with an uncertainty of 2%. An additional uncertainty of about 10% was derived using simulations to account for the difference between the jet showering for a W \u2192 qq jet and an H \u2192 bb or Z \u2192 bb jet, using parton shower models from pythia 8 and herwig++ 2.7.1 [62]. The EE5C tune [63] is used for herwig++. The jet mass resolution was found to be 23% larger in the data than in the simulation, with an uncertainty of 18%. The ratio of the N -subjettiness selection efficiency in the data to the simulation (scale factor) was found to be 1.11 \u00b1 0.08 with an additional jet p T -dependent uncertainty. The jet mass scale and N -subjettiness scale factor uncertainties affect only the event yields whereas the jet mass resolution affects both the yields and the m T distributions.  The b tagging [47] efficiency scale factor uncertainties for AK4 jets are measured in multijets and tt+jets samples, separately for b quark jets and for light-quark and gluon jets. These uncertainties affect only the signal event yields for the low-mass analysis. For the high-mass analysis, the b tagging efficiency scale factor uncertainty for subjets is measured using multijet and tt+jets samples and is applied to the subjets for H and Z jets. These affect both the event yields and the m T distributions.",

            "text": "Upper limits are set on the cross sections for the two production modes (pp \u2192 Tbq and pp \u2192 Ttq) with the two decay modes (tH and tZ) as well as their sum (tH+tZ), for four fractional width (\u0393/m T ) values. The individual limits for the tH decay mode neglect potential contributions from the tZ and bW decay modes and, similarly, the individual limits for the tZ decay mode neglect potential contributions from the tH and bW decay modes. The (tH+tZ) sum limits are computed assuming the relative cross sections for the two channels calculated in the respective model for a particular width based on ref. [70]. For pp \u2192 Tbq, this corresponds to the T singlet model with \u03ba W = \u03ba H = \u03ba Z and for pp \u2192 Ttq, to the (TB) doublet model with \u03ba H = \u03ba Z and \u03ba W = 0, where \u03ba W , \u03ba H , and \u03ba Z denote the T coupling parameter to bW, tH, and tZ, respectively. Only potential contributions from bW are neglected for the (tH+tZ) experimental limits. The calculated cross sections for tH and tZ are approximately the same but unequal. This is due both to mass effects explicit in the decay width expressions of ref. [5] and to additional amplitude contributions associated with the 2 \u2192 4 finite width calculation arising from T quarkmediated Feynman diagrams relevant to the large-width regime, such as the t-channel exchange of a T quark. The fractional width values include 10, 20, and 30%, and the narrow-width case. Given the estimated effective Gaussian mass resolution of about 5%, the experimental limits set using the narrow-width simulated signal samples are applicable to (Breit-Wigner) fractional widths of up to about 5%. The experimental upper limits on cross sections are generally more restrictive for smaller widths given the narrower line shapes. The computed cross sections are found to depend approximately linearly on the fractional width. Figure 8 shows the cross section upper limits for Tbq production for the tHbq and tZbq channels, and their sum. The figure includes results for a narrow fractional width, corresponding to \u0393/m T \u2264 0.05, and for a fractional width of 10%. Results for the same quantities are shown in figure 9 for fractional widths of 20 and 30%. Similar results for",

Depending on the fractional width, it can be seen that this search has expected sensitivity for T masses within the T singlet model up to 1.28 TeV (for tHbq + tZbq with 30% fractional width). For T masses below 1 TeV, the models of the associated production with a bottom quark are strongly constrained by the observed limits from the low-mass search signature, which are generally more stringent than expected above 0.75 TeV; for the T singlet model masses in the range 0.70 to 1.00 TeV are excluded at 95% CL for some fractional widths between 5 and 30%. For the T quark masses above 1.00 TeV, the observed limits are above model predictions, and so no exclusion at 95% CL is possible with this data set in this mass range. The models with the associated production with a top quark have lower cross sections with a median expected sensitivity for T quark masses within the (TB) doublet model of 0.82 TeV for the largest fractional width of 30%. However, for this model, no range of masses is excluded at 95% CL for any of the masses and fractional widths considered here.",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The T quarks are assumed to couple only to the standard model third-generation quarks. The decay channels exploited are T \u2192 tH and T \u2192 tZ with the hadronic decay of the top quark and primarily the bb decay of the Higgs and Z bosons. This search is designed to be sensitive to T quark fractional widths of up to 30% and a wide range of masses. The background is mostly due to standard model tt+jets and QCD multijet events with some contributions from W+jets processes. No significant excess of data above the standard model background is observed and upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on \u03c3 B(T \u2192 tH) and \u03c3 B(T \u2192 tZ), which vary between 2 pb and 20 fb for T masses ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 TeV in the Tbq and Ttq production channels.
