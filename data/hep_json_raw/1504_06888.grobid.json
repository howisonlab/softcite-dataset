The measurement uses 9.5 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV recorded by the CDF II detector. The asymmetry as a function of m bb is consistent with zero, as well as with the predictions of the standard model. The measurement disfavors a simple model including an axigluon with a mass of 200 GeV=c 2 , whereas a model containing a heavier 345 GeV=c 2 axigluon is not excluded.",

            "text": "In recent years, the values of the forward-backward asymmetry (A FB ) of top-quark-pair production measured at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at Fermilab have been consistently larger [1] than those predicted by the standard model (SM) [2][3][4][5][6][7]. Further study of this phenomenon has led to a number of proposed extensions of the SM [8]. One specific class of such models is the lowmass axigluon [9]. These models include a new axialvector boson (axigluon) with a mass below the tt threshold and a natural width broad enough to evade detection in light-quark resonance searches and predict a nonzero forward-backward asymmetry due to the interference between amplitudes mediated by the gluon and the axigluon. In the simplest models, the axigluon has equal couplings to all the quarks. Hence, a stringent test of such models is the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of pair production of other quark flavors, such as the bottom.",

This definition is invariant under boosts along the beam axis. At hadron colliders, bb pairs are almost exclusively produced by the strong interaction of quarks and gluons (QCD). The vast majority of bb pairs are produced via gluon-gluon fusion, which yields no asymmetry due to the symmetric initial state. In the qq \u2192 bb process, a positive A FB \u00f0bb\u00de arises from higher-order QCD corrections involving either real or virtual gluons. Since the valence-quark parton-density functions dominate over the gluon parton-density functions at large Bjorken x, we enhance the contribution of the quark-antiquark initial state over the symmetric gluon-fusion background by requiring large values of bb mass, m bb > 150 GeV=c 2 .",

This asymmetry arises from the interference between the gluon and axigluon in the same fashion as the Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 interference of the Drell-Yan process [12]. One key feature of this interference is that the A FB changes sign at the mass pole of the heavy axial resonance [9]. The observation of such a sign flip would provide a significant indication of the underlying dynamics. The predictions of two different representative axigluon models are given in Table I  [9]. A relatively light 200 GeV=c 2 axigluon has been previously studied in the context of the top-quark asymmetry [13], and a heavier 345 GeV=c 2 axigluon is of interest because its mass is just below the tt threshold. Both of these axigluons are assumed to have a width equal to 25% of their mass.",

The selection requirements imposed on all three calculations match the event selection requirements employed in our analysis: pseudorapidity j\u03b7 b;b j < 1. The CDF II detector [17] is an azimuthally symmetric magnetic spectrometer with a large tracking volume inside a solenoid. Outside the solenoid are sampling calorimeters. The calorimeters are further surrounded by the steel flux return of the solenoid and muon detectors [17]. The data used for this analysis were collected by the CDF II detector using three online event selections (triggers), which require at least one jet with transverse energy E T > 50, 70, or 100 GeV, respectively [10]. To control the trigger rate, the two lower-threshold triggers only accept one event out of every 100 or 8 events that satisfy their requirements, respectively, while the highest-threshold trigger accepts all events meeting its requirements.

We find that the negativetagged component of the MC templates must be scaled by 1.5 (1.3) to match the total number of low (high) significance negative tags observed in the data. This scaling is propagated into the positive-tagged region of the templates as this population of \"fake\" tags is considered to be positive-negative symmetric, leaving the original net distributions unchanged [20]. From these corrected templates, we then obtain \u03bb for low-and highsignificance b-tagged jets. We also correct the values of r used in the three dijet mass bins for the higher negative tag rates observed in the data.",

Rather than attempting to tune the simulation to reproduce all of these processes in the proper amounts, we use data in a control region that is expected to be enhanced in the background and depleted of the bb signal. The control region is defined by loosening the requirements of the b-tagging algorithm (looser than the low-significance \"L\" tag) and requiring that at least one of the tagged jets is negatively tagged. The sample of events satisfying these criteria is nonoverlapping with the signal sample and is composed almost entirely of the background but is kinematically very similar to the signal sample. The forward-backward asymmetry of this sample is assumed to approximate the forward-backward asymmetry of the background in the signal sample (see Fig. 3).",

Mismeasurement of jet energies principally affects the measurement of the dijet mass. Since we use wide mass bins, this effect is small. We estimate the effect using MC samples of dijet events produced with the PYTHIA event generator at leading order in the strong coupling constant, using the CTEQ5L parton distribution functions. We select events that have a pair of bottom quarks, whether produced directly or in the parton shower, to produce the signal model. This signal model allows the determination of a matrix relating the measured dijet mass to the particle-level dijet mass, as a function of j\u0394Qj. The matrix, summed over j\u0394Qj, is shown in Fig. 4. In 80% to 95% of events, the dijet mass is reconstructed in the same bin. The relative uncertainty on each element of the matrix ranges from a few percent on the diagonal up to very large values far off the diagonal. The fraction of events in which the detector-level dijet mass migrates to a different bin than that of the particle-level dijet mass necessitates a correction and increases the uncertainty in the measurement of the particle-level A FB as a function of dijet mass (see Sec. III G). The correction relies on the MC description of the particle-level dijet mass to be approximately correct. Figure 5 shows that the detector-level dijet mass is correctly described by the MC, which supports the reliability of the smearing matrix. ",
