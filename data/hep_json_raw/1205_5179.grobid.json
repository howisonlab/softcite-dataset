Final states with an electron and jets or with missing transverse momentum and jets were analysed, searching for resonances or other deviations from the Standard Model predictions. No evidence for any leptoquark signal was found. The data were combined with data previously taken at HERA, resulting in a total integrated luminosity of 498 pb \u22121 . Limits on the Yukawa coupling, \u03bb, of leptoquarks were set as a function of the leptoquark mass for different leptoquark types within the Buchm\u00fcller-R\u00fcckl-Wyler model. Leptoquarks with a coupling \u03bb = 0.3 are excluded for masses up to 699 GeV.",

This makes the data especially sensitive to virtual leptoquark exchange and LQ-DIS interference.",

Using ep collisions, the Yukawa coupling, \u03bb, of possible LQ states to electron and electron neutrino is probed. In pp and pp collisions, the LQ production proceeds via the strong interaction and is independent of \u03bb. Thus the experimental approaches are complementary and ep collisions provide a unique testing ground. For this paper, the predictions for LQ cross sections were determined in leading order (LO) using the CTEQ5D parton density functions [13] (PDFs) using the Buchm\u00fcller-R\u00fcckl-Wyler model [1]. This model assumes that some of the leptoquarks are doublets or triplets with degenerate masses. This differs from the assumptions made for production via the strong interaction where in general a singlet state is assumed. The LHC experiments so far provided only limits for scalar LQs [10][11][12].",

The characteristic build-up time for the HERA accelerator was approximately 40 minutes. Spin rotators on either side of the ZEUS detector changed the transverse polarisation of the beam into longitudinal polarisation and back again. The lepton beam polarisation was measured using two independent polarimeters, the transverse polarimeter (TPOL) [22] and the longitudinal polarimeter (LPOL) [23]. Both devices exploited the spin-dependent cross section for Compton scattering of circularly polarised photons off electrons to measure the beam polarisation. The luminosity and polarisation measurements were made over time intervals that were much shorter than the polarisation build-up time. The polarisation values measured in different data taking periods are shown in Table 1. The fractional systematic uncertainty on the measured polarisation was 4.2% for TPOL and 3.6% for LPOL.",

Figure 16  (17) shows the limits on the S L 1/2 (S L 1 ) LQ compared to the limits from AT-LAS [10], H1 [5] L3 [6] and OPAL [7]. The L3 and OPAL limits were evaluated up to 500 GeV. Limits using pp or pp collisions are obtained from leptoquark pair production, which is independent of \u03bb. Therefore it is not obvious whether the limits should be compared directly. The ATLAS exclusion range given in Fig. 17 also depends on the assumption that the branching ratio of the LQ state to electron and quark is one. Limits using e + e \u2212 collisions are obtained from a search for indirect effects in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq. In general, the limits from this analysis are significantly better than the LEP limits for M LQ < \u221a s, and comparable for M LQ > \u221a s. The limits obtained by ZEUS are similar to those obtained by H1.",
