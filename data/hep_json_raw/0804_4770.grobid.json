            "text": "We report new measurements of the decays B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03b3, B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 using a data sample of 657 \u00d7 10 6 B meson pairs accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider. We measure branching fractions B(B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03b3) = (8.7 +2.9 \u22122.7 +0.9 \u22121.1 ) \u00d7 10 \u22127 , B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3) = (7.8 +1.7 \u22121.6 +0.9 \u22121.0 ) \u00d7 10 \u22127 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3) = (4.0 +1.9 \u22121.7 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10 \u22127 . We also report the isospin asymmetry \u2206(\u03c1\u03b3) = \u22120.48 +0.21 \u22120.19 +0.08 \u22120.09 ; and the first measurement of the direct CP -violating asymmetry A CP (B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03b3) = \u22120.11\u00b1 0.32 \u00b1 0.09, where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. PACS numbers: 11.30.Hv,13.40.Hq,14.65.Fy,14.40.Nd The b \u2192 d\u03b3 process, which proceeds via a loop diagram ( Fig. 1(a)) in the Standard Model (SM), provides a valuable tool to search for physics beyond the SM, since the loop diagram may also involve virtual heavy non-SM particles [1]. The process has been observed in the exclusive modes B \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 and B \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 by Belle [2] and Babar [3]. Branching fractions for these modes have been used to constrain the ratio of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements [4] |V td /V ts |; a non-SM effect may be observed as a deviation of |V td /V ts | from the expectation based on measurements of other CKM matrix elements and unitarity of the matrix [5]. An additional contribution from an annihilation diagram ( Fig. 1(b)) may induce a direct CP -violating asymmetry in B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03b3, and an isospin asymmetry between B \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 modes; the latter can be used to constrain the CKM unitarity triangle angle \u03c6 3 [6]. These quantities are also sensitive to physics beyond the SM [7]. In this paper, we report new measurements of the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 and B \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 processes using a data sample of (657 \u00b1 9) \u00d7 10 6 B meson pairs accumulated at the \u03a5(4S) resonance. With a data sample almost twice as large and an improved analysis procedure, these results supersede those in [2]. ",

The B \u2192 K * \u03b3 background can mimic the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 signal if the kaon from the K * is misidentified as a pion. To suppress B \u2192 K * \u03b3 events we calculate M K\u03c0 , where the kaon mass is assigned to the charged pion candidate; for \u03c1 0 \u03b3, the lower of the two M K\u03c0 values is taken (misassignment tends to give a higher M K\u03c0 ). For the \u03c1 + \u03b3 mode, we reject the candidate if M K\u03c0 < 0.90 GeV/c 2 , while for the \u03c1 0 \u03b3 mode we use M K\u03c0 in the fit procedure to extract the signal (note: M K\u03c0 > 0.92 GeV/c 2 is required when optimizing selection criteria). The b \u2192 s\u03b3 modes (B \u2192 K * \u03b3 and other B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decays) contribute to the background when the \u03c1 and \u03c9 candidates are formed from random combinations of particles. Decays with a \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 can mimic the signal if one of its daughter photons is not detected. To suppress this background, we reject the candidate if | cos \u03b8 hel | > 0.80, 0.75 and 0.83 for the \u03c1 + \u03b3, \u03c1 0 \u03b3 and \u03c9\u03b3 mode, respectively, where the helicity angle \u03b8 hel is the angle between the \u03c0 + track (the normal to the \u03c9 decay plane) and the B momentum vector in the \u03c1 (\u03c9) rest frame.
