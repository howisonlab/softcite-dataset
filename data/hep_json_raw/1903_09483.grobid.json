At the current, pilot stage of the AMoRE project we employ six calcium molybdate crystals with a total mass of 1.9 kg, produced from 48 Ca-depleted calcium and 100 Mo-enriched molybdenum ( 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 ). The simultaneous detection of heat (phonon) and scintillation (photon) signals is realized with high resolution metallic magnetic calorimeter sensors that operate at milli-Kelvin temperatures. This stage of the project is carried out in the Yangyang underground laboratory at a depth of 700 m. We report first results from the AMoRE-Pilot 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search with a 111 kg day live exposure of 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 crystals. No evidence for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 100 Mo is found, and a upper limit is set for the half-life of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 of 100 Mo of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 9.5 \u00d7 10 22 years at 90% C.L. This limit corresponds to an effective Majorana neutrino mass limit in the range m \u03b2\u03b2 \u2264 (1.2 \u2212 2.1) eV.",

In the standard model (SM) of particle physics, neutrinos are assumed to be massless particles with 1/2 spin. However, the recent discovery of neutrino oscillations [1][2][3][4] demonstrates that the flavour states of neutrinos are linear combinations of mass eigenstates characterized by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix [5,6]. These results clearly demonstrate that neutrinos have nonzero mass; the mass eigenstates' different time evolutions produce the observed oscillations between different flavour eigenstates.",

            "text": "The advanced molybdenum-based rare process experiment (AMoRE) [28,29] aims to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 100 Mo using a simultaneous heat and scintillation detection technique with crystals operating at mK temperatures. In the present stage of the project, AMoRE-Pilot, calcium molybdate (CaMoO 4 ) crystals are used as the active target elements in a detector concept where the source material is also the detection medium [30][31][32]. The crystals are 100 Mo-enriched and 48 Ca-depleted ( 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 ). Since 48 Ca is a double beta decaying isotope with a Q value of 4271 keV, its 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay energy spectrum overlaps the 3034 keV energy region of interest (ROI) for AMoRE's 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay search, producing an irreducible background at the level of \u223c 0.01 counts/(keV kg year) [30]. Thus, the amount of 48 Ca must be reduced. Six 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 crystals with a total mass of 1.9 kg are currently in operation at the 700-meter-deep Yangyang underground laboratory (Y2L) located in South Korea. A cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (CF-DR) is used to cool down the AMoRE-Pilot detector array to 10-20 mK, including sensors for heat and scintillation detection. The data sample used for the results reported here corresponds to a 52.1 kg day live exposure of 100 Mo.",

A 400 nm thick gold film deposited on the lower surface of the crystal serves as a phonon collector. This is connected to an MMC by 25 annealed gold wires [36]. The MMC exploits the paramagnetic nature of erbium ions in a gold host (Au:Er) [37]. The devices were micro-fabricated on a Si wafer by sputtering a planar niobium coil with a layer of Au:Er sensor material immediately above the coil [38,39].  A persistent current in the superconducting coil generates a magnetic field in the Au:Er sensor material, and energy deposited in the crystal produces a temperature increase in the Au:Er that alters its magnetization. This results in a change in the coil current that is measured by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) [31]. Because of the high sensitivity of the MMC sensors, the detector setup is able to measure precisely the temperature increase resulting from any type of radiation absorption, and particle detection with very high energy resolution is achievable [35,40].",

The goals of the first four runs were to: realize the measurement setup with a refrigerator system and a lead shield system in the underground laboratory; investigate the noise and the background levels; and improve the detector performance. During these research and development stages, we used a CF-DR with a 7 mK minimum temperature in a newly built laboratory room in Y2L. As shown in Fig. 2, we also assembled a detector array comprised of several detector modules below the 10 mK plate. For the first five runs, five 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 crystal detector modules with a total mass of 1.547 kg (0.727 kg of 100 Mo) were operated. During this R&D phase, we significantly improved the detectors performance. We installed a 15 cm-thick lead shield to cover the top and the sides of the CF-DR to suppress background radiation from external sources. An active muon veto system (MVS) was used to tag and reject muon-induced background events. Vibration noise from the pulse tube refrigerator of the CF-DR, initially the dominant source of signal noise, was reduced by a few orders of magnitude by means of a two-stage vibration isolation system consisting of a spring suspended still (SSS) with eddy current dampers (ECDs) [42] and a mass-spring damper that mechanically isolates the detector tower from the 10 mK CF-DR mixing chamber plate (see Fig. 2). During the fifth run, the SSS mechanism was not fully operational because of damage to one of its magnets. However, it still had outstanding vibration reduction performance that improved the noise conditions by several orders of magnitude [42]. The SSS system was in full operation for the subsequent runs.",

For this, we added a sixth 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 crystal of mass 340 g, thereby increasing the total crystal mass to 1.887 kg (0.886 kg of 100 Mo). The six detector modules were arranged in a single tower inside a superconducting lead shield. The detector tower and shield were maintained at a temperature of 20 mK throughout the data collecting period. Data were acquired by a 12 channel 18-bit ADC, including six phonon and six photon channels. A continuous stream of data was saved and later triggered off-line via the application of a Butterworth filter [43,44]. The full dynamic range of the measurement was \u00b1 3 V, and limited by a differential amplifier. The sampling rate of the DAQ was set to 100 kHz, which is sufficient for pulse shape discrimination (PSD) of different types of background events based on the rise time of the phonon signals. During this phase of the experiment, we collected a 69.0 kg day 100 Mo exposure. The six detector channels and the cryogenic system operated reliably throughout the approximately 1000 h measurement period.",

Divergence from this assumption produces a small non-linearity in the amplitude-to-energy calibration. The amplitudes of non-\u03b2/\u03b3 -like events are also calculated with this method, but their energy scale is different because of the mismatch between their pulse shape and that of the template. Signal amplitudes can be influenced by a long term instability of the temperature. In the present system, it appears as a long-term thermal gain drift that can be corrected with frequent reference to events with a known energy. For AMoRE-Pilot, one of the six crystals, Crystal 2 (see Table 2), has a high internal 210 Po \u03b1 rate. These events were used as standard signals to provide gain stabilization signals for all six crystals. The application of the gain stabilization for one detector using events from another one was demonstrated in previous AMoRE-Pilot runs. For future runs, gain corrections will be improved with stabilization heaters installed on each crystal [45].",

The suitability of a quadratic polynomial with no constant term for energies above 2615 keV was verified by fitting \u03b1-peaks, including the 2311 keV 147 Sm peak, with another quadratic polynomial function. Although \u03b1and \u03b2/\u03b3 -events generate pulses of different amplitudes due to the different signal shapes, good agreement between \u03b1calibration lines and a quadratic polynomial provides evidence that a similar detector response is adequate for \u03b2/\u03b3 -events with energies above 2615 keV. Figure 3 shows a background energy spectrum from one of the crystals that shows signal amplitudes that cover the energy range below 2615 keV, and displays a non-linear behaviour and deviations from the calibration. The solid line shows the calibration. The negative slope reflects the nonlinear term. The peak positions are in good agreement with the 95% calibration prediction interval (P.I.) shown as dashed lines, indicating that the energy of a signal can be estimated using the calibration and error over a wide energy region. Uncertainties in the energy calibration are included in the likelihood marginalization [46].

These were implemented by using two particle identification (PID) techniques. One is from the relative amplitude ratio between light and heat signals (L/H ratio) in the simultaneous phononscintillation measurement and the other is the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) of the heat signals. The underlying concept of the L/H ratio method is that the amount of scintillation light emitted by a scintillator as a result of the interaction with a charged particle depends inversely on its stopping power [47]. An event induced by a \u03b2/\u03b3 deposit in a crystal yields a larger light signal than one induced by an \u03b1 with the same energy, resulting in different L/H ratios.

While many background events can deposit energy across multiple locations, double beta decay events are contained within short ranges of the emitted electrons, confining the energy deposition to a single crystal. Thus a multiple-hit selection was applied to reject events with signals in more than one crystal within a 2 ms coincidence window. The MVS surrounding the external lead shield provided the capability for rejecting signals induced by cosmogenic muons. Approximately 2000 muons/day are detected in the MVS. A veto period of 100 ms was applied following each muon signal to reject any coincident signals in the crystals. During the pilot stage, the MVS did not provide the full 4-\u03c0 coverage over the detector modules. The muon rejection efficiency was determined to be between 87 and 92%, depending on the crystal location. Finally, we reject  208 Tl \u03b2 decay and, thus, a veto-time of 30 min was set following the 212 Bi \u03b1 detection. This dead time only applies to a single crystal. The good energy resolution and identification capabilities of the crystals allowed the 212 Bi events to be tagged with high specificity. With this method, the 208 Tl rejection efficiency in the ROI was 97.5%. In the present analysis, the dead time from the 30 min 212 Bi tagging was 1.7%, as indicated in Table 3. Since the phonon signal duration is approximately 1 s, we applied a trigger dead time of 1 s for each of the triggered events. The exposures that survived each event selection requirement are summarized in Table 3. The energy spectrum in the 2850-3150 keV ROI for the 111 kg day exposure that remains after the application of the event selection requirements and coincidence tagging vetoes is shown in Fig. 7. The spectrum shape of the 50 events in the plot is approximated by a linear background function plus the EMG function for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 peak. The width of this energy region was chosen to cover the total response function for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 events while avoiding the influence of the 2615 keV 208 Tl peak.",

An upper limit of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 9.5\u00d710 22 years is achieved with a background level of 0.55 counts/(keV kg year), which will be improved in succeeding measurements. The result reported here is the first low temperature measurement using MMC sensors with 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 crystals for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search experiment. Although this is not the best limit on 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 100 Mo, it provides validation of the AMoRE detection concept for a competitive 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search. The background levels seen in the present study likely have external origins, and major changes are being incorporated in the shielding arrangement to reduce them. Using the levels of radioactive contaminants measured in a series of HPGe counting measurements for the materials used in the detector assembly, simulations indicate the presence of nonnegligible backgrounds that originate from the materials used for sensor readout, such as pin connectors, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and Stycast-2850 epoxy. During the preparations for the sixth AMoRE-Pilot run, Polyimide-based PCBs were checked for their radioactive contamination levels and used to replace the G10 PCBs that were used in the fifth run. In addition, no pin-connectors or Stycast epoxy were used in cryostat regions below the mixing chamber plate (below the low-background shield layers of 10 cm thick lead and 6 cm thick copper). The MC simulations suggest that almost all of the nearly constant backgrounds between 4 and 8 MeV in the electron spectrum are caused by neutron captures in the cryostat and the surrounding structures. To reduce the neutroninduced background, we installed layers of neutron shields in the detector setup. The neutron shields include a layer of 4 mm boric acid placed between the outer vacuum chamber and the lead shield, 2.5 cm thick borated-polyethylene plates, and 10-30 cm thick layers of polyethylene bricks surrounding the sides, bottom and top of the detector system. Background levels that remain after these modifications are being investigated.",

The light signals for \u03b1 and \u03b2/\u03b3 events have fast and slow components [33]. The time response of the MMCs to the fast component is close to the intrinsic rise-time of approximately 200 \u00b5s [41], which is one to three orders of magnitude faster than those for the thermal detectors based on NTD-Ge thermistor readouts [60][61][62][63]. It is an especially important feature because of the relatively short 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life of 100 Mo (7.1\u00d710 18 year) [10]. As AMoRE is scaled up to larger detector masses, unresolved pileups of two random 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signals will be an irreducible major background [64,65]. The rate of unresolved pileups from 100 Mo decay will be approximately 0.4 events/year in a 0.4 kg 48depl Ca 100 MoO 4 with a pile-up rejection time resolution of 1 ms, which would be a nonnegligible background for a larger number of crystals with a poorer time resolution. Thus, the use of MMCs as the temperature sensors has a clear advantage: better time resolution results in reduced background levels from unresolved pileup signals in rare event searches.",
