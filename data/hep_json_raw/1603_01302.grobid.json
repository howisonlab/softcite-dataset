There are two mass eigenstates, the so-called heavy and light states, which are linear combinations of the flavor eigenstates. In the absence of CP-violation in mixing, the mass eigenstates are also CP eigenstates, with the heavier state expected to be the CP-odd state. The lifetimes of the two mass eigenstates can be different from each other and different from the average B 0 s lifetime. A measurement of the B 0 s lifetime in either a pure CP-odd state or pure CP-even state would give important additional information about the B 0 s system.",

Throughout this Letter, the appearance of a specific charge state also implies its charge conjugate. This decay channel was first observed by the LHCb collaboration [1], and later confirmed by the Belle [2], CDF [3] and D0 [4] collaborations. A measurement of the B 0 s lifetime in this channel gives access to the lifetime of the heavy mass eigenstate. The lifetime measurement can be transformed into a measurement of the parameter \u0393 H , the decay width of the heavy B 0 s mass eigenstate. CDF [3] and LHCb [5] have measured this lifetime, reporting \u03c4 (B 0 s ) = (1.70 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.03) ps and \u03c4 (B 0 s ) = (1.70 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.026) ps respectively, which are in good agreement with each other and somewhat longer than the mean lifetime \u03c4 (B 0 s ) = (1.52 \u00b1 0.007) ps [6]. In this analysis, we report the lifetime of the B 0 s meson measured in the decay channel",

The data used in this analysis were collected with the D0 detector during Run II of the Tevatron collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 10.4 fb \u22121 . The D0 detector is described in detail elsewhere [9]. The detector components most relevant to this analysis are the central tracking and the muon systems. The former consists of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) and a central scintillating fiber tracker (CFT) surrounded by a 2 T superconducting solenoidal magnet. The SMT has a design optimized for tracking and vertexing for pseudo-rapidity of |\u03b7| < 3 [10]. For charged particles, the resolution on the distance of closest approach as provided by the tracking system is approximately 50 \u00b5m for tracks with p T \u2248 1 GeV/c, where p T is the component of the momentum perpendicular to the beam axis. It improves asymptotically to 15 \u00b5m for tracks with p T > 10 GeV/c. Preshower detectors and electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters surround the tracker. The muon system is located outside the calorimeter, and consists of multilayer drift chambers and scintillation counters inside 1.8 T iron toroidal magnets, and two similar layers outside the toroids. Muon identification and tracking for |\u03b7| < 1 relies on 10 cm wide drift tubes, while 1 cm minidrift tubes are used for 1 < |\u03b7| < 2. We base our data selection on reconstructed charged tracks and identified muons. Events used in this analysis are collected with both single muon and dimuon triggers. To avoid a trigger bias in the lifetime measurement, we reject events that satisfy only impact parameter-based triggers. We simulate signal events with PYTHIA [11] and EvtGen [12], followed by full detector simulation using GEANT3 [13]. To correct for trigger effects, we weight simulated events so that the p T distributions of the muons match the distributions in data.",

Figure 2 shows the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) mass distribution for events with M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) within one   Table I summarizes the systematic uncertainties considered for this measurement. The contribution from possible misalignment of the SMT detector has been previously determined to be 5.4 \u00b5m [20]. The invariant mass window used for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution is varied from its nominal value of 200 MeV/c 2 to 160 and 240 MeV/c 2 and the fit is performed for each new mass window selection. This results in a systematic uncertainty of 8 \u00b5m. We test the modeling and fitting method used to estimate the lifetime using data generated in pseudoexperiments with a range of lifetimes from 300 to 800 \u00b5m. A bias arises due to imperfect separation of signal and background. Since the background has a shorter lifetime than the signal, the result is a slight underestimate of the signal lifetime. The bias has a value of -4.4 \u00b5m for an input lifetime of 500 \u00b5m and 500 signal events. We have corrected the lifetime for this bias and a 100% uncertainty on the correction has been applied to the result. We estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the models for the \u03bb and mass distributions by varying the parameterizations of the different components: (i) the cross-feed contamination is modeled by two Gaussian functions instead of one, (ii) the exponential mass distribution for the combinatorial background model is replaced by a first order polynomial, (iii) the smoothing of the non-parametric function that models the B \u00b1 contamination is varied, and (iv) the exponential functions modelling the background \u03bb distributions are smeared with a Gaussian resolution similar to the signal. To take into account correlations between the effects of the different models, a fit that combines all different model changes is performed. We quote the difference between the result of this fit and the nominal fit as the systematic uncertainty.",

Using the B \u00b1 background sample extracted from the data, we performed a fit for the lifetime of this component of the background.
