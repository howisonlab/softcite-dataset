We selected events with two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET > 2.5 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.0, with no other particles detected in \u22127.4 < \u03b7 < +7.4. The two showers have similar ET and azimuthal angle separation \u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0; 34 events have two charged particle tracks, consistent with the QED process pp \u2192 p + e + e \u2212 +p by two-photon exchange, while 43 events have no charged tracks. The number of these events that are exclusive \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is consistent with zero and is < 15 at 95% C.L. The cross section for pp \u2192 p + \u03b3\u03b3 +p with |\u03b7(\u03b3)| < 1.0 and ET (\u03b3) > 2.5 GeV is 2.48 +0.40   \u22120.35 (stat) +0.40 \u22120.51 (syst) pb.",

In the latter case it is possible for another gluon exchange to cancel the color of the fusing gluons, allowing the (anti)proton to emerge intact with no hadrons produced. For pp collisions, this is the \"exclusive\" process pp \u2192 p + \u03b3\u03b3 +p, for which the leading order diagram is shown in Fig. 1a  [1,2]. The outgoing (anti)proton has nearly the beam momentum, and transverse momentum p T < \u223c 1 GeV/c, having emitted a pair of gluons in a color singlet. There is a pseudorapidity gap \u2206\u03b7 > 6 adjacent to the (anti)proton. In Regge theory this is diffractive scattering via pomeron [3,4], IP, exchange. The cross section for |\u03b7(\u03b3)| < 1.0 and transverse energy E T (\u03b3) > 2.5 GeV is predicted [5,6] to be \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3) exclusive \u223c 0.2 -2 pb, depending on the low-x (unintegrated) gluon density. Additional uncertainties come from the cross section for g + g \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3, the probability that no hadrons are produced by additional parton interactions (rapidity gap survival factor and Sudakov Jordan.",

The calculation is also imprecise because of the low Q 2 , the squared 4momentum transfer. The total theoretical uncertainty on the cross section can be estimated to be a factor \u00d73 \u00f73 [8]. Apart from its intrinsic interest for QCD, the process tests the theory of exclusive Higgs boson production [1,2,5,[8][9][10][11][12][13]  Fig. 1b, which may be detectable at the LHC. The leading order processes gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and gg \u2192 H are calculable perturbatively, but the more uncertain elements of the exclusive processes (mainly the unintegrated gluon densities, the Sudakov suppression and the gap survival probability) are common to both (see Fig. 1). For a 120 GeV standard model Higgs boson the exclusive cross section at \u221a s = 7 TeV is 3 fb with a factor \u00d73 \u00f73 uncertainty [8]. Processes other than gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 can produce an exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 final state. Contributions from qq \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 are respectively < 5% and < 1% of gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [5]. Backgrounds to exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 events to be considered are \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03b7, with each meson decaying to two photons, of which one is not detected. We also consider events where one or both protons dissociate, e.g. p \u2192 p \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , to be background. These backgrounds are small.",

It is surrounded by the central and end-plug calorimeters covering the range |\u03b7| < 3.6. Both calorimeters have separate EM and hadronic compartments. A proportional wire chamber (CES) [17], with orthogonal anode wires and cathode strips, is embedded in the central EM calorimeter, covering the region of |\u03b7| < 1.1, at a depth of six radiation lengths. It allows a measurement of the number and shape, in both \u03b7 and azimuth \u03c6, of EM showers (clusters of wires or strips). The anode-wire pitch (in \u03c6) is 1.5 cm and the cathodestrip pitch varies with \u03b7 from 1.7 cm to 2.0 cm. The CES provides a means of distinguishing single photon showers from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 up to E T (\u03c0 0 ) \u223c 8 GeV. The region 3.6 < |\u03b7| < 5.2 is covered by a lead-liquid scintillator calorimeter called the Miniplug [18]. At higher pseudorapidities, 5.4 < |\u03b7| < 7.4, scintillation counters, called beam shower counters (BSC-1/2/3), are located on each side of the CDF detector. Gas Cherenkov detectors, with 48 photomultipliers per side, covering 3.7 < |\u03b7| < 4.7, detect charged particles, and were also used to determine the luminosity with a 6% uncertainty [19].",

This rapidity gap requirement rejected a large fraction of inelastic collisions as well as most events with more than one interaction (pile-up). A second EM cluster with similar properties was required at level two. A level three trigger selected events with two calorimeter showers consistent with coming from electrons or photons: i.e., passing the requirement (cut) that the ratio of shower energy in the hadronic (HAD) calorimeter to that in the EM (HAD:EM) be less than 0.125, and that the signal shape in the CES is consistent with a single shower.",

Two central, |\u03b7| < 1, EM showers were required with E T > 2.5 GeV to avoid trigger threshold inefficiencies. The energy resolution is dE/E \u223c 8% from test beam studies and in situ p/E matching for electrons. A refined HAD:EM ratio cut of < 0.055 + 0.00045E was applied, as well as an acoplanarity cut of |\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6| < 0.6. The trigger selection efficiency for single photons was measured using data collected with an interaction trigger (minimum bias). The BSC-1 gap trigger was taken to be 100% efficient as the BSC-1 trigger threshold was clearly above the noise level and the offline selection criteria. We measured an overall trigger efficiency of \u03b5 trig = 92% \u00b1 2%(syst). A weighting process was necessary due to the different slope in E T of the minimum bias probe data compared to the signal. The trigger efficiency did not show any \u03b7 or \u03c6 dependence for |\u03b7| < 1. Monte Carlo signal simulation data samples were generated using the superchic program (version 1.3) [11,20] based on recent developments of the Durham KMR model [2]. The Monte Carlo samples were passed through a simulation of the detector, cdfsim 6.1.4.m including geant version 3.21/14 [21]. The systematic error was estimated by using the binwise uncertainty of the efficiency in the weighting process of the signal Monte Carlo sample. Taking into account a combined detector and offline reconstruction efficiency of \u03b5 rec = 55% \u00b1 3%(syst), and a photon identification efficiency of \u03b5 id = 93% \u00b1 1%(syst), we obtained a photon-pair efficiency \u03b5 pho = \u03b5 2 trig * \u03b5 rec * \u03b5 2 id = 40% \u00b1 3%(syst). The systematic uncertainties of the reconstruction and identification efficiency were estimated by shifting kinematical input parameters over a reasonable interval motivated by the dominating EM-energyscale uncertainty [22]. The offline selection then required that no activity other than these two showers (or clusters of showers) occured in the entire detector, |\u03b7| < 7.4. We used the same procedure as in our earlier study of exclusive e + e \u2212 events [23], searching all the calorimeters for any signal above noise levels, determined using noninteraction events; 99.2% of such events have no tower (out of 480) with E T > 125 MeV. We also required the CLC counters and the more forward BSC counters to have signals consistent with only noise. Events triggered only on a bunch crossing (zero-bias) showed that the exclusive efficiency, \u03b5 excl , defined as the factor to be applied to the delivered luminosity to account for the requirement of no pile-up, is \u03b5 excl = 6.8% \u00b1 0.4%(syst). The probability P (0) of a zero-bias event satisfying all the exclusivity cuts, i.e., having no detected inelastic interaction, is P (0) = A exp(\u2212n) = A exp(\u2212L x \u03c3 vis ), where L x is the single bunch crossing luminosity (cm \u22122 ) and \u03c3 vis is the visible cross section; \u03c3 vis = \u03c3 inel if every inelastic collision is detected. We find \u03c3 vis = 67 \u00b1 6 mb. In the absence of noise (above our chosen thresholds) A = 1.0; we find A = 0.98 \u00b1 0.02. We checked that the rate of candidate events, corrected for the exclusive efficiency, was constant during data taking (one year). The systematic uncertainty was estimated using the spread in slope parameters from fits to data in different time periods.",

In particular the M (\u03b3\u03b3) distribution (Fig. 2b) extending up to 15 GeV/c 2 is as expected, as well as the acoplanarity \u03c0\u2212\u2206\u03c6(\u03b3\u03b3) (Fig. 2c) and the 2-vector sum of p T (Fig. 2d); in these plots (unlike Fig. 2a) the superchic Monte Carlo is normalized to the same number of events as the data. An important issue is whether some of these events could be \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , rather than \u03b3\u03b3. Note that \u03b3\u03c0 0 events are forbidden by C-parity. The CES chambers give information on the number of EM showers. The minimum opening angle \u2206\u03b8 min between the two photons from \u03c0 0 decay is 2 tan \u22121 m(\u03c0) p(\u03c0) = 3.1 \u2022 for p(\u03c0) = 5 GeV, well separated in the CES chambers, which have a granularity < 0.5 \u2022 . A \u03c0 0 can fake a \u03b3 only if one photon ranges out before the CES, or falls in an inactive region (8%) of the detector. All of the 68 e \u00b1 events in our sample, with similar energies, had matching showers in the CES chambers. A geant [21] simulation predicts the probability that a photon in our energy range produces a shower to be > \u223c 98.3%. We summed the number of reconstructed CES showers in the event, mostly 2 or 3 as shown in Fig. 3 (left). The distribution agrees very well with the \u03b3\u03b3 simulation, and strongly disagrees with the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 simulation. Fitting to the sum of the two components gives a best fit to the fraction F (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.0, with a 95% C.L. upper limit of 15 events. Since obtaining this result, a new calculation of exclusive \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 production [26] predicts \u03c3 excl (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = 6 -24 fb for E T (\u03c0 0 ) > 2.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.0, < \u223c 0.01 of our measured exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 cross section. In the cross section calculation we take this background to be zero. Exclusive \u03b7\u03b7 production is also expected to be negligible. The only other significant background could be undetected proton dissociation, about 10% for the QED e + e \u2212 process but <1% for P I + P I \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 [5,27,28]. The cross section for both photons with E T (\u03b3) > 2.5 GeV and |\u03b7(\u03b3)| < 1.0 and no other produced particles is given by: where \u03b5 is the product of the trigger, reconstruction, identification, and conversion efficiencies (22.8%) in Table I. The systematic uncertainty on the conversion probability was estimated by varying the exclusivity cuts by \u00b110%. We find \u03c3 \u03b3\u03b3,excl (|\u03b7(\u03b3)| < 1, E T (\u03b3) > 2.5 GeV) = 2.48 +0.40 \u22120.35 (stat) +0.40 \u22120.51 (syst) pb. The theoretical prediction [11] is strongly dependendent on the low-x gluon density, having central values 1.42 pb (mstw08lo) or 0.35 pb (mrst99), with other uncertainties estimated to be a factor of about \u00d73 \u00f73 [28]. A comparison of our measurment with the only theoretical prediction available to date is shown in Fig. 4. The rates of e + e \u2212 and \u03b3\u03b3 events with E T (e/\u03b3) > 5 GeV are consistent with those in our earlier studies [14,23]. In conclusion, we have observed the exclusive production of two high-E T photons in proton-antiproton collisions, which constitutes the first observation of this process in hadron-hadron collisions. The cross section is in agreement with the only theoretical prediction, based on g+g \u2192 \u03b3 +\u03b3, with another gluon exchanged to cancel the color and with the p andp emerging intact. If a Higgs boson exists, it should be produced by the same mechanism (see Fig. 1), and the cross sections are related.",
