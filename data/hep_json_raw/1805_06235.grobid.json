By combining new data with our previous results in this energy range we measured the values of R uds and R at nine center-of-mass energies between 3.08 and 3.72 GeV. The total accuracy is about or better than 2.6% at most of energy points with a systematic uncertainty of about 1.9%. Together with the previous precise R measurement at KEDR in the energy range 1.84-3.05 GeV, it constitutes the most detailed high-precision R measurement near the charmonium production threshold.",

The first way was to scale the spatial resolution  of the drift chamber, while the second method assumed scaling systematic uncertainties of the calibration parameters of the tracking system. The maximal obtained variation of the detection efficiency at various energies is less than 0.3%. Thus, the uncertainty related to track reconstruction is about 0.4%. The trigger efficiency uncertainty is about 0.2% and mainly comes from the calorimeter thresholds in the secondary trigger. It was estimated by varying the threshold in the software event filter.",
