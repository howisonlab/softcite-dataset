This alters the definition of the integrated CP asymmetry to A wgt CP (p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ).

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) does not provide a source of charge-parity (CP ) symmetry violation large enough to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe [1]. The ongoing experimental effort in searching for CP violation in particle decays aims to find effects that are not expected in the SM, such that new dynamics are required. Whilst the existence of CP violation in kaon and beauty meson decays is well established [2,3], no observation has been made in the analyses of beauty baryons or charm hadrons, although evidence of CP violation has recently been claimed for the former [4]. The most precise searches for CP violation in the charm sector have been made using self-conjugate, singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) decays of the neutral D 0 meson to K \u2212 K + and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final states [5,6]. Such SCS decays can include significant contributions from loop-level amplitudes, within which new dynamics can enter. This article reports a search for CP violation in the decays of the \u039b + c charm baryon to the SCS pK \u2212 K + and p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final states (generically referred to as ph \u2212 h + ). 1 The difference in CP asymmetry between the two decays, \u2206A CP , is measured in a manner similar to previous measurements using D 0 decays [5,6]. There is little theoretical understanding of 1 Charge conjugation is implied throughout this article, except in the definition of asymmetry terms.",

The quantity A raw includes contributions from the CP asymmetry in the \u039b + c decay, as well as asymmetries due to experimental effects such as the \u039b 0 b production asymmetry and the muon and hadron detection asymmetries. These effects have been measured at LHCb [5,[8][9][10], but with large uncertainties. Using them directly, to correct for the experimental asymmetries in A raw , would then result in large systematic uncertainties on the correction factors. Instead, assuming that the asymmetries are, or can be made to be, mode independent, the difference \u2206A CP = A raw (pK \u2212 K + ) \u2212 A raw (p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ) is equal to the difference in the \u039b + c decay asymmetries, as all other asymmetries cancel. A weighting technique is used to equalise the pK \u2212 K + and p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + sample kinematics, thereby improving the level of cancellation of the various production, reconstruction, and selection asymmetries in \u2206A CP , the formalism for which is presented in section 2.

            "text": "The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5 % at low momentum to 1.5 % at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a PV, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. To control possible left-right interaction asymmetries, the polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data-taking. The configuration with the magnetic field vertically upwards (downwards) bends positively (negatively) charged particles in the horizontal plane towards the centre of the LHC. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a twostage software trigger, which applies first a simplified and then a full event reconstruction. For the dataset used for the present analysis, at the hardware trigger stage the presence of a high-p T muon candidate is required. In the first stage of the software trigger, this candidate must be matched to a good-quality track which is inconsistent with originating directly from any PV and has a p T above 1 GeV/c. The second stage requires a two-, three-, or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from all PVs, where at least one of the tracks is consistent with being a muon. At least one charged particle must have p T > 1.6 GeV/c and must be inconsistent with originating from any PV. A multivariate algorithm [14] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decays of beauty hadrons.",

To assess an associated systematic uncertainty based on the choice of signal model, the signal \u039b + c and \u039b \u2212 c yields are determined using the method of sideband subtraction.

Measurements of the \u039b 0 b production asymmetry and the muon, kaon, and pion detection asymmetries using LHCb data exist [5,[8][9][10], and estimates of the proton detection asymmetry using simulated events have been used previously [8], and so the measurement of \u2206A wgt CP can be corrected for directly.
