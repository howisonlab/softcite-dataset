MINERvA is currently running in the \"low energy\" (LE) NuMI beam designed for the MINOS experiment in which it plans to integrate 4 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target (POT) in neutrino mode and 2 \u00d7 10 20 POT in anti-neutrino mode. The anti-neutrino exposure is a mixture of data taken with a partially constructed detector and the full MINERvA detector. After a shutdown beginning in 2012, the NuMI beamline will operate in the \"medium energy\" (ME) tune. Figure 1 shows the predicted neutrino flux in both the LE and ME beams.",

A continuous series of these planes forms the \"tracker\" region of the MINERvA detector. The analysis reported in this paper used events exclusively from the tracker; however, the MINERvA detector also contains a region where the planes of scintillator are interspersed with passive nuclear targets. These will allow study of A-dependence in the CCQE rates at different energy or Q 2 . Figure 1 also shows the expected rate of CCQE interactions in the scintillator tracker and in the passive nuclear targets. Of course, not all of these events will be accepted in the analysis, but the combination of the significant mass of the MINERvA targets and the high intensity statistics available in the NuMI beam are very promising for this measurement.",

            "text": "The planned results for CCQE in MINERvA include measurements of the CCQE total cross-section, \u03c3 , and d\u03c3 /dQ 2 on the scintillator target. At low to moderate Q 2 , Q 2 < \u223c 1 GeV 2 , the primary goal is comparison with results from K2K [2,3], MiniBoone [4,5], SciBooNE [6] and NOMAD [7]. In particular, there are open questions about the apparent cross-section enhancement at low energy and moderate Q 2 and suppression at low Q 2 in the existing data. MINERvA will repeat these measurements on its multiple nuclear targets to look for changes with increasing A and nuclear density. At higher Q 2 , MINERvA will be able to make the first measurements of the axial form factor and compare the high Q 2 behavior with vector form factors. MINERvA also plans to compare \u03bd e CCQE with the same \u03bd \u00b5 process using the \u223c 1.5% of its events from \u03bd e contamination in the beam. Finally, MINERvA will search for the analogous neutral current process \u03bd p \u2192 \u03bd p which is experimentally more challenging due to backgrounds from non-leptonic processes. The study described in this paper is a preliminary comparison of muon kinematics in CCQE candidates between data and simulation with a sample of 0.4 \u00d7 10 20 POT in the LE anti-neutrino beam. These data were taken during the construction of the MINERvA detector when only approximately one half of the detector had been installed. The scintillator tracker fiducial mass for this sample is 3.0 of the 6.4 metric ton fiducial mass available in the full detector. This sample is 12% of the total exposure measured as the product of POT and fiducial mass. The reference simulation is GENIE 2.6.2 [8]. The CCQE cross-section at nucleon level comes from the derivation of Llewellyn-Smith [9] with vector form factors from the BBBA2005 parametrization [10], the pseudo-scalar form factor from PCAC, and the axial form factor in the dipole form with m A = 0.99 GeV/c 2 . The nuclear effects when scattering from carbon come from the Fermi gas model of Bodek and Ritchie [11], and Pauli blocking is implemented by a requirement that the outgoing nucleon has momentum of above the Fermi momentum of 221 MeV/c. Final state interactions of outgoing hadrons from the hard scattering process is simulated by INTRANUKE [8]. of which will select different CCQE-rich final states and admit different backgrounds in the analysis. First, we can perform a topological track based analysis with a one-track (muon) low Q 2 component and a two-track (muon and nucleon) component at higher Q 2 where reconstruction of the nucleon, at least when it is a proton, is feasible. This style of analysis can be most easily compared to results using similar techniques from Sci-BooNE [6] and NOMAD [7]. Second, we can perform an inclusive analysis that selects only a muon and removes background based on a veto on Michel electrons from the chain \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 e + \u03bd e\u03bd\u00b5 \u03bd \u00b5 which is most similar to the analysis from the Mini-BooNE [4,5] experiment. Finally, one can identify tracks as in the first analysis but remove events with additional visible recoil energy in the detector which is far from the vertex. The latter stipulation is important for keeping events with low energy nucleons in the final state from the remaining nucleus after the CCQE interaction. The analysis presented here as our first preliminary work towards this reaction is in the final of these three styles. As we progress in this analysis, we plan to add the other techniques.",

For events originating within the fiducial volume, the asymptotic efficiency at high energies is \u2248 65%. The efficiency is highest at low Q 2 and falls slowly to \u2248 30% at high Q 2 not because of the low recoil selection, but because of the decrease in muon acceptance to enter the MINOS near detector. A hit-level GEANT4-based simulation of the detector is used to evaluate these efficiencies and correct the neutrino interaction simulation for detector efficiencies and resolutions. We gain confidence in this simulation by comparison of distributions of candidate events in the data with the simulation in quantities that are largely independent of the neutrino flux and the interactions.

            "text": "We present the results as comparisons to the simulation, including background events generated as described above. The simulation also includes our prediction of the untuned flux from a beamline simulation which has large uncertainties that we expect to reduce in the future [12]. We evaluate these uncertainties in the a priori neutrino flux to be lowest, about 7%, at the peak energy of the flux shown in Fig. 1 and significantly larger above this \"focusing peak\" energy with an asymptotic uncertainty at high energy of 16%. These large flux uncertainties must be included in the comparisons between data candidates and the simulation. These uncertainties allow a significant distortion in shape  of the neutrino flux with neutrino energy, E \u03bd . However, since the Q 2 spectrum as a function of E \u03bd is approximately independent of E \u03bd , at least far below the kinematic limit, Q 2 < \u223c 2m p E \u03bd , we do not expect the flux uncertainties to significantly distort the predicted Q 2 distribution. Figure 4 shows the reconstructed neutrino energy and Q 2 of the reactions for candidate events. The comparison shows a disagreement outside the uncertainty band in the distribution of neutrino energies just above the focusing peak, 3 GeV< E \u03bd < 6 GeV. However, the shape of the Q 2 distribution, at least in the region where CCQE events make up the majority of the signal, is in reasonable agreement with our simulation. Note that the simulation uses an axial mass of 0.99 GeV. MiniBoonE and SciBooNE, measuring quasi-elastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering for 0.3 < E \u03bd < 2 GeV, prefer significantly higher axial masses, consistent with m A = 1.3 GeV [4,5,6], whereas the NOMAD experiment, measuring quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, 3 < E \u03bd < 100 GeV, prefers m A consistent with the value of 0.99 GeV assumed in our simulation. Figure 5 shows the ratio of data to simulation for the MINERvA analysis in the low and high neutrino energy portions of the sample. Both appear more consistent with the low m A assumed rather than the high m A of MiniBooNE and SciBooNE; however, caution is warranted in drawing this conclusion because the MINERvA result only includes systematic uncertainties from the neutrino flux, and does not yet include uncertainties on the detector reconstruction or the backgrounds to the quasi-elastic interactions.",

            "text": "The MINERvA collaboration has performed its first comparison of a quasi-elastic rich anti-neutrino sample with expectations for a range of assumed axial masses. The selection requires a muon from a neutrino interaction in the scintillator target and a low observed recoil away from the vertex in the final state to enhance elastic events. MIN-ERvA possesses an anti-neutrino sample approximately eight times as large as that in this analysis on tape, and will be able to improve the background rejection of this analysis in the future through a variety of techniques that the capabilities of the detector make possible.",
