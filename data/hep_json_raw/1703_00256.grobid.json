            "text": "The phenomenon of CP violation (CPV), related to the difference in behaviour between matter and antimatter, remains an intriguing topic more than fifty years after its discovery in the neutral kaon system [1]. Within the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), CPV is incorporated by a single, irreducible weak phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix [2,3]. However, the amount of CPV in the SM is insufficient to explain the observed level of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe [4][5][6]. Therefore, new sources of CPV beyond the SM are expected to exist. Experimental observations of CPV remain confined to the B-and K-meson systems. Recently, the first evidence for CPV in \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was found at the level of 3.3 standard deviations [7] and a systematic study of CPV in beauty baryon decays has now begun.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [20], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The A raw asymmetries are found to be (\u22122.8 \u00b1 5.0) \u00d7 10 \u22122 for signal decays and (1.7 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22122 for the control mode. After applying the weighting procedure to account for kinematic differences between signal and -6 - control-mode decays, a value of (2.0\u00b10.7)\u00d710 \u22122 is obtained for the control-mode asymmetry, which yields efficiency-uncorrected \u2206A CP = (\u22124.8\u00b15.0)\u00d710 \u22122 . The total signal yields from the fits to the data are 600 \u00b1 33 candidates for \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , and 22 911 \u00b1 162 for \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8 decays. The uncertainties are statistical only. This represents the first observation of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay mode. The invariant mass distributions of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 subsamples used for the A T and A T measurements, with fit results superimposed, are shown in figure 4. From the signal yields, the triple-product asymmetries are found to be A T = (\u22122.8 \u00b1 7.2) \u00d7 10 \u22122 and A T = (4.0 \u00b1 6.9) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , and the resulting efficiency-uncorrected parity-and CP -violating  ",

The experimental resolution on C T is studied with simulated signal events. The effect of the fit model choice is studied by fitting simulated pseudoexperiments with an alternative fit model, in which the Crystal Ball functions are replaced with bifurcated Gaussian functions and the exponential background shape is replaced with a polynomial. Systematic effects from \u039b 0 b polarisation [34], multiple candidates, and residual physical backgrounds are also studied. These contributions have negligible impact on the measured asymmetries.",
