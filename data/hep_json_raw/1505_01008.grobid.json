Whether it is the Standard Model (SM) Higgs or an indication of new physics, the fact that it is found in the search of the SM Higgs boson makes the Higgs mechanism more creditable. Furthermore, precision measurements of properties of the new Higgs boson are critical for the Higgs physics; any deviation away from the SM expectation will improve our knowledge of the elementary particles and their interactions. With this consideration, an e + e \u2212 collider with high luminosity and energy is best suited for the Higgs research.",

            "text": "The Initial State Radiation (ISR) is an important issue in high energy processes, especially for lepton colliders. ISR affects cross section significantly, for example, reduces the ZH cross section by more than 10% within the Whizard framework as shown in Fig. 3. Though the cancelation for soft and collinear photons has been validated to all orders in perturbation theory [9], and the hard photon emission could also be calculated perturbatively order by order in QED in principle [10,11], actually, the maximal order for the hard photon is set to be 3 in the calculation. Besides ISR, another macro effect at high luminosity electron-positron collider, beamstrahlung, also affects the cross section. In the storage ring the beamstrahlung effect makes the beam energy spread larger and reduces the center of mass energy [4]. The tool that is widely used to simulate this effect for e + e \u2212 colliders is GuineaPig++ [12,13]. The total energy spread caused by beamstrahlung and synchrotron radiation is studied by Monte-Carlo simulation and determined to be 0.1629% at CEPC [4]. In the event generation, even though the energy spread is taken into account, the correction on the cross sections of Higgs production is negligible while the observable difference on the e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq is only at percentage level. The results are listed in Tab. 1.  The cross sections are much higher in the vicinity of the Z pole and the improvements to the precision of Z pole measurement could benefit from such an large statistics. For the partial decay width Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , the statistical uncertainty can be reduced to 0.03% [3] compared to 0.15% for LEP experiments [14][15][16][17]. The electroweak mixing angle is an important free parameter in SM, which rotates the original SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) filed into the physically observed vector boson state. It is sensitive to higher-order electroweak correction and could be a precise test of SM perturbative theory. The precision of the mixing angle is expected to be 0.02% from Z \u2192 bb process Ref. [3]. The precision measurement for the mass of the Z boson may also be improved on CEPC, and the uncertainty due to statistic is expected to be 0.1MeV [3].",

The observed cross section of SABH in the next-toleading order for theoretical prediction depends not only on the angular range covered by detector, but also on the cut of the electron energy. Although the Whizard is designed to calculate it up to next leading order, unfortunately, it is not adequate for SABH process, especially at the low energy region.",

For example, W bosons can decay into a quark-antiquark pair, i.e., W + W \u2212 \u2192 u\u016bdd or ccss, which creates four jets and tends to contaminate the ZH in many cases. Although ZZ pair production is one magnitude smaller than WW, it is especially severe for the background of the Higgs measurements as it may lead to the same final states and kinematics with ZH. The precision measurements for W boson mass can be achieved by both the direct method and threshold scan. By applying the direct method, the measurements can be performed with the same run at \u221a s = 250GeV where most attention is paid on Higgs. The main challenge of direct method is the calibration of detectors and the modeling of resolution, which is proportional to \u221a s. Thanks to the high luminosity of CEPC, the uncertainty due to the beamstrahlung can be reduced to \u223c 1MeV. Besides the W boson mass measurements, these vector boson productions, W + W \u2212 and ZZ, are also a good resource for the precision measurements for triple boson coupling of electroweak theory. Any deviation from SM will be the hint for new physics beyond the Standard Model.",
