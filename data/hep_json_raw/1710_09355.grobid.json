            "text": "Studies of charged-hadron yields have long been a key tool for exploring perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena in high-energy particle and nuclear collisions [1]. Measurements in proton-lead (pPb) collisions can shed light on initialstate nuclear effects in these interactions [2]. An example is the nuclear modification of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that can be observed in measurements of hadron [3][4][5][6][7] and jet [8][9][10] production. Such measurements also provide reference data for understanding the hot, dense medium produced in nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. At the CERN LHC energies, measurements of proton-nucleus (pA) collisions allow studies of the nuclear gluon distributions and parton shadowing effects at very small values (10 \u22124 -10 \u22126 ) of the Bjorken x variable [2,11]. This provides a crucial test of current theoretical approaches for high-energy QCD [11][12][13], and yields important constraints on phenomenological models and event generators [14][15][16][17].",

            "text": "The number of primary charged hadrons, N ch , is commonly characterized by its pseudorapidity density, dN ch /d\u03b7. The pseudorapidity, \u03b7, is defined as \u2212 ln[tan \u03b8/2], where \u03b8 is the polar angle of the particle with respect to the beam axis. The center-of-mass energy dependence of dN ch /d\u03b7 constrains the theoretical modeling of particle production arising from hard and soft QCD processes in high-energy hadronic interactions. In the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the hot medium produced in AA collisions, modifications of hadron production have been observed. Studying the energy dependence of the pseudorapidity density in different colliding systems (proton-proton (pp), pA, AA), for both total inelastic and non-single-diffractive (NSD) [18][19][20] collision processes, improves our understanding of these modifications in the AA case by identifying nuclear effects present in the initial state. Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, which reproduce the main characteristics JHEP01 (2018)045of experimental results from hadronic collisions at lower energies, can provide predictions for the energy dependence of hadron production using different implementations of QCD effects [21].",

Following earlier analyses in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9-13 TeV [22][23][24][25] and in lead-lead collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [26], N ch is restricted to \"primary\" charged hadrons, defined to include prompt hadrons as well as decay products of all particles with proper decay length c\u03c4 < 1 cm, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime of the particle and c is the velocity of light in vacuum. Contributions from prompt leptons and decay products of longer-lived particles and secondary interactions are excluded. For \u221a s NN = 5.02 (8.16) TeV, the beam energies per nucleon were 4 (6.5) TeV and 1.58 (2.56) TeV for the proton and lead nucleus, respectively. Because the beam energies were asymmetric and the proton was going in the positive \u03b7 lab direction, massless particles emitted at midrapidity in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass, \u03b7 cm = 0, will be detected at \u03b7 lab = 0.465. Results are compared to predictions from the KLN model [11], as well as the Epos LHC (v3400) [17,27], Hijing [14] (versions 1.3 [15] and 2.1 [12]), and Dpmjet-III [16] MC event generators.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |\u03b7 lab | < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel detector modules. The barrel region of the pixel detector consists of three layers, which are very close to the beam line. They are located at average radii of 4.3, 7.2, and 11.0 cm, and provide excellent position resolution with their 150\u00d7100 \u00b5m pixels. The forward hadron (HF) calorimeter uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. It consists of two halves, each located 11.2 m from the interaction region, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |\u03b7 lab | < 5.2. The beam pickup for timing (BPTX) devices were used to trigger the detector readout. They are located around the beam pipe at a distance of 175 m on either side of the interaction point (IP) and are designed to provide precise information on the LHC bunch structure and the timing of the incoming beams. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [28].",

The collision events are selected online by requiring a coincidence of signals from both BPTX devices, indicating the presence of both proton and lead ion bunches crossing the IP, and at least one energy deposit above the readout threshold of 3 GeV on either side of the HF. The offline selection of NSD events is accomplished by requiring that at least one energy deposit greater than 3 GeV is found on each of the two sides of the HF and at least one reconstructed interaction vertex is found. A study of noncolliding bunches shows that these requirements are also sufficient to reject all backgrounds not originating from pPb collisions. The probability to select events in the presence of a single (noncolliding) beam is found to be around 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 per bunch crossing, to be compared to the average number of collisions per bunch crossing of 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Consequently, the contribution of background events from beam, beam halo, and cosmic ray sources to the observed yields is negligible. The total number of pPb collision events passing the selection criteria is approximately 420 thousand and 3 million at \u221a s NN = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV, respectively.",

This procedure is repeated for every hit in the first layer, and the projected z positions are saved as vertex candidates. The primary vertex is determined in a second step. If the magnitude of the difference between the z positions of any two vertex candidates is smaller than 0.12 cm, they are combined into a vertex cluster. The vertex cluster with the highest number of associated vertex candidates is selected as the primary vertex, and the final vertex z position, z v , is given by the average z position of the associated vertex candidates.

The distributions shown are the average of the measured distributions from the three types of tracklets (1+2, 1+3, and 2+3), which are consistent with each other within 3%. A clear difference in the particle densities between the lead ion (\u03b7 lab < 0) and the proton (\u03b7 lab > 0) beam directions is observed. The measured dN ch /d\u03b7 lab distribution at 5.02 TeV agrees with the measurement by the ALICE Collaboration [30]. The multiplicities at 8.16 TeV are significantly higher than those at 5.02 TeV. Figure 3 shows a comparison between the measurement at 8.16 TeV and theoretical calculations from the Hijing (versions 1.3 and 2.1), Epos LHC (v3400), and Dpmjet-III MC generators, and the KLN model. The Hijing and Epos generators were tuned to data from RHIC and the LHC, respectively. Calculations from Hijing 2.1, a two-component model that combines perturbative QCD descriptions of hard parton scatterings with a string excitation model for soft interactions, agree with the experimental data in the region \u22120.5 < \u03b7 lab < 1.5 when the nuclear modification of the initial parton distributions (shadowing) is included in the calculation. The Hijing 1.3 calculation overpredicts the particle density because it has an older implementation of the gluon shadowing effects. The JHEP01(2018)045 importance of shadowing can be assessed using the comparison of Hijing 2.1 simulations generated with and without this physics process included. The results are significantly higher than the data when shadowing is disabled. The KLN parton saturation model combines Glauber modeling of the collision geometry with a simple model for the unintegrated parton distributions that accounts for the existence of a saturation momentum scale [31,32]. It describes the particle density accurately for |\u03b7 lab | < 1 but overall shows a steeper increase of density versus \u03b7 lab than observed in the data, similar to what was observed in the comparisons to the PHOBOS deuteron-gold (dAu) data at 200 GeV [33] and ALICE data at 5.02 TeV [30]. The Dpmjet-III generator, commonly used in the description of cosmic ray, nucleon-nucleon, and nucleon-nucleus interactions, is based on the dual parton model [34], which generates soft hadronic interactions by considering the expansion of nonperturbative QCD in the limit where the number of color and flavor states are large [35]. This generator is found to predict both a steeper increase versus \u03b7 lab and a higher particle density over the measured \u03b7 lab interval. The Epos generator, which is based on the Gribov-Regge theory and includes the effect of collective hadronization in hadron-hadron scattering, was found to describe pp data up to 13 TeV [25], but underpredicts the observed dN ch /d\u03b7 lab by a roughly constant factor over the entire measured range for pPb at 8.16 TeV.",

            "text": "One of the main goals of the heavy ion studies is to understand hadron production in the extremely dense medium formed in AA collisions. One way to approach this goal is to consider a direct comparison between the charged-hadron multiplicity density in minimum -7 -JHEP01(2018)045 Figure 3. Distributions of the pseudorapidity density of charged hadrons in the region |\u03b7 lab | < 2.4 for NSD pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV (squares) compared to predictions from the MC event generators Epos LHC [17,27] (v3400), Hijing [14] (versions 1.3 [15] and 2.1 [12]), and Dpmjet-III [16], as well as from the KLN model [11]. The shaded boxes around the data points indicate their systematic uncertainties. The proton beam goes in the positive \u03b7 lab direction. bias pp and pA collisions, reference systems for particle production in the absence of a QGP, and central AA collisions (the most extreme type of collisions with the highest particle multiplicities). The comparison is made by dividing dN ch /d\u03b7 cm by the number of participating nucleons, N part , determined by a Glauber model calculation [4,36]. This normalization is the one assumed in two-component models (e.g. Hijing) for the bulk of the particle production. In order to compare particle production in pPb collisions to that in symmetric collision systems such as pp or AA, the rapidity shift due to the asymmetric beam energies must be taken into account. The average charged-hadron multiplicity density at midrapidity in the center-of-mass frame, dN ch /d\u03b7 cm | |\u03b7cm|<0.5 , in pPb collisions is calculated by integrating the data in the interval \u22120.035 < \u03b7 lab < 0.965, corresponding to |\u03b7 cm | < 0.5 for massless particles. A correction is applied to account for the massless assumption entering the calculation of the pseudorapidity shift: 0.1 and 0.2% for the 5.02 TeV and 8.16 TeV analyses, respectively, as obtained from the Epos generator. The 1% variation in the results, obtained when this correction is evaluated from Hijing, is quoted as an additional uncertainty for the dN ch /d\u03b7 cm | |\u03b7cm|<0.5 results. In the range |\u03b7 cm | < 0.5, values of 17.31 \u00b1 0.01 (stat) \u00b1 0.59 (syst) and 20.10 \u00b1 0.01 (stat) \u00b1 0.85 (syst) are obtained for pPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV, respectively. Figure 4 shows the dependence of normalized dN ch /d\u03b7 cm on the collision energy for various collision systems and event selections. The NSD pA results are found to be lower than those from central AA collisions [26,[37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50]   Figure 4. Comparison of the measured dN ch /d\u03b7 cm at midrapidity, scaled by the number of participating nucleons (N part ) in pPb [30,51], pAu [52], dAu [33,48,53] and central heavy ion collisions [26,[37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50], as well as NSD [22,23,50,[54][55][56][57] and inelastic [25,37,56,58,59] pp collisions. The AA data points at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV have been shifted horizontally for visibility. The dashed curves, included to guide the eye, correspond to a fit to the data points using the same functional form as in refs. [46,59].",

Based on pairs of pixel clusters from two different layers of the barrel region of the CMS pixel detector, the distributions have been obtained for NSD pPb events at both collision energies. The measured dN ch /d\u03b7 lab distribution at 5.02 TeV is consistent with published results by the ALICE Collaboration. At 8.16 TeV, the measured dN ch /d\u03b7 lab distribution is higher than the predictions of Epos LHC, but significantly lower than the predictions from the Hijing 1.3 and Dpmjet-III event generators. At \u03b7 lab \u2248 0, the measured distributions are in good agreement with calculations from the KLN gluon saturation model and predictions from the Hijing 2.1 event generator with the effects of gluon shadowing included. The charged-hadron multiplicity densities in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame, dN ch /d\u03b7 cm | |\u03b7cm|<0.5 , are 17.31\u00b10.01 (stat)\u00b10.59 (syst) and 20.10\u00b10.01 (stat)\u00b10.85 (syst) at \u221a s NN = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV, respectively. When comparing the average charged-particle JHEP01(2018)045 density per participant nucleon for pp, pA, and AA collisions as a function of collision energy, the pA results are found to be below those in central AA collisions and NSD pp collisions, but coincide with the trend seen in inelastic pp collisions. These results represent the first measurement of hadron production at this new center-of-mass energy frontier in nuclear collisions, and provide constraints for the understanding of nonperturbative QCD effects in high-energy nuclear collisions.",
