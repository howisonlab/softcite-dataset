The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u00c01 recorded by the CMS experiment. The search uses decays of the Higgs bosons to tau pairs. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The resulting upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) has been extremely successful in describing a wide range of phenomena in particle physics, and has survived some four decades of experimental testing. However, the only remaining undiscovered particle predicted by the SM, the Higgs boson [1][2][3][4][5], suffers from quadratically divergent self-energy corrections at high energies [6]. Numerous extensions to the SM have been proposed to address these divergences. One such model, supersymmetry [7], a symmetry between fundamental bosons and fermions, results in cancellation of the divergences at tree level. The minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model (MSSM) requires the presence of two Higgs doublets. This leads to a more complicated scalar sector, with five massive Higgs bosons: a light neutral state (h), two charged states (H AE ), a heavy neutral CP-even state (H), and a neutral CP-odd state (A).",

The algorithm considers all possible combinations of these objects and determines which are consistent with the kinematics of tau decay. Among those, it chooses the most isolated in terms of the presence of nearby reconstructed particles. Requirements on the isolation variables, specific to each final state, determine an operating point in the space of tau identification efficiency versus the jet-totau misidentification rate.

The algorithm estimates the original tau threemomenta by maximizing a likelihood with respect to free parameters corresponding to the missing tau-neutrino momenta, and subject to all applicable kinematic constraints. Other terms in the likelihood take into account the tau-decay phase space and the probability density in the tau transverse momentum, parametrized as a function of the tau-pair mass. This algorithm yields a tau-pair mass with a mean consistent with the true value, and a distribution with a nearly Gaussian shape. The mass resolution is $21% at a Higgs boson mass of 130 GeV=c 2 , to be compared with $24% for the (non-Gaussian) distribution of the invariant mass reconstructed from the visible tau-decay products. The observed reconstructed tau-pair mass distribution summed over all three channels is shown in Fig. 1. Various imperfectly known or imperfectly simulated effects can alter the shape and normalization of the reconstructed tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The main sources of normalization uncertainties include the total integrated luminosity (11%) [23], background normalizations (Table I), Z production cross section (4%), and lepton identification and isolation efficiency (0.2-2.0% depending on lepton type). The tau identification efficiency uncertainty is estimated to be 23% from an independent study [15]. The uncertainty due to trigger efficiencies is 0.2% for the h and e channels, and 2.0% for the e h channel. Uncertainties that contribute to mass-spectrum shape variations include the tau (3%), muon (1%), and electron (2%) energy scales, and uncertainties on the E T scale that is used for the tau-pair invariant-mass reconstruction [24]. The E T scale uncertainties contribute via the jet-energy scale (3%) and unclustered energy scale (10%), where the unclustered energy is defined as the energy remaining after vectorially subtracting leptons and objects clustered in jets with p T > 10 GeV=c.",

The tau-pair decay mode in final states with one e or plus a hadronic decay of a tau, and the e final state were used. The observed tau-pair mass spectrum reveals no evidence for neutral Higgs boson production, and we determine an upper bound on the product of the Higgs boson cross section and tau-pair branching fraction as a function of m A . These results, interpreted in the MSSM parameter space of tan versus m A , in the m max h scenario, exclude a previously unexplored region reaching as low as tan \u00bc 23 at m A \u00bc 130 GeV=c 2 .",
