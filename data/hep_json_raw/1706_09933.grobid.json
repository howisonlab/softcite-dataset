            "text": "Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in proton-proton collision events with a charged lepton (electron or muon), two jets identified as originating from a bottom quark decay, and significant imbalance in the transverse momentum. The search was performed using a data sample corresponding to 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Events with this signature can arise, for example, from the electroweak production of gauginos, which are predicted in models based on supersymmetry. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the estimated standard model backgrounds. Limits are obtained on the cross sections for chargino-neutralino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 ) production in a simplified model of supersymmetry with the decays \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u03c7 0 1 and \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 H \u03c7 0 1 . Values of m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 between 220 and 490 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level by this search when the \u03c7 0 1 is massless, and values of m \u03c7 0 1 are excluded up to 110 GeV for m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2248 450 GeV.",

SUSY predicts the existence of a superpartner for every SM particle, with the same gauge quantum numbers but differing by one half unit of spin. In R-parity conserving SUSY models, supersymmetric particles are created in pairs, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable [9][10][11]. As a result, SUSY also provides a potential connection to cosmology as the LSP, if neutral and stable, may be a viable dark matter candidate.",

Pair production of these particles would have the largest cross section for SUSY processes and therefore provides the strongest discovery potential with small datasets. However, the absence of signals in these searches suggests that strongly produced SUSY particles may be too massive to be found with the present data. In contrast, neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 ) and charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 ), mixtures of the superpartners of the SM electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs bosons, can have masses within the accessible range. Because of the absence of color charge, the production cross sections are lower, and these particles may have thus far eluded detection. This provides strong motivation for dedicated searches for electroweak SUSY particle production.",

Here, \"H\" refers to the 125 GeV Higgs boson [29], interpreted as the lightest CP-even state of an extended Higgs sector. The H boson is expected to have SM-like properties if all of the other Higgs bosons are much heavier [30]. The observation of a Higgs boson in a SUSY-like process would provide evidence that SUSY particles couple to the Higgs field, a necessary condition for SUSY to stabilize the Higgs boson mass. Pair production of neutralinos and/or charginos can thus lead to the HH, VH, and VV decay modes, with a large fraction of the possible final states containing at least one isolated lepton. Such events can be easily selected with simple triggers and do not suffer from large quantum chromodynamics multijet background.",

No excesses above the SM expectations were observed, and the results of those searches were used to place lower limits on the mass of pair-produced charginos and neutralinos. Assuming mass-degenerate \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 , and sleptons (the SUSY partners of the SM leptons) with lower masses, the searches probed masses up to approximately 700 GeV. For the WH decays assumed here, the strongest mass limit was around 270 GeV. With the increase of the LHC collision energy from 8 to 13 TeV, and a significantly larger data set, searches based on 13 TeV data have the potential to quickly surpass the sensitivity of the previous analyses.",

Within the field volume are several particle detection systems. Charged-particle trajectories are measured with silicon pixel and strip trackers, covering 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity, where \u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)] and \u03b8 is the polar angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction. The transverse momentum, the component of the momentum p in the plane orthogonal to the beam, is defined in terms of the polar angle as p T = p sin \u03b8. A lead-tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter surround the tracking volume, providing energy measurements of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets in the range |\u03b7| < 3.0. Muons are identified and measured within |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid. Forward calorimeters on each side of the interaction point encompass 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing momentum imbalance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction. A two-tier trigger system selects pp collision events of interest for use in physics analyses. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [39].",

To select collision events, we require at least one reconstructed vertex. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the objects returned by a jet finding algorithm [42,43] applied to all charged tracks associated with the vertex, plus the corresponding associated missing transverse momentum. The missing transverse momentum vector, p miss T , is defined as the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates projected onto the plane perpendicular to the proton beams. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . Events with possible contributions from beam halo processes or anomalous noise in the calorimeter can have large values of E miss T and are rejected using dedicated filters [44]. Data events are selected using triggers that require the presence of an isolated electron or muon with p T thresholds of 27 GeV or 24 GeV, respectively. Muon events may also be accepted using a trigger that does not require isolation but instead requires p T > 50 GeV.",

The CRs after the signal region level selections are used to validate the modeling of the main backgrounds and to assign systematic uncertainties in the background predictions. to mirror the signal region selection. The expected signal contribution in any of the CRs is always less than 1% of the total SM yields, and typically much smaller. The dilepton top quark background can be isolated in the CR2 control region by selecting dilepton events. In addition to a lepton passing the analysis selections, events must contain one of the following: a second electron or muon, an isolated track candidate, or a tau lepton candidate. The latter categories are included to accept hadronically decaying tau leptons. If all the kinematic selections used for the signal regions are applied, the number of events in CR2 is too low to validate the modeling of the dilepton top quark background.
