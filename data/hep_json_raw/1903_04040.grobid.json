            "text": "A measurement is presented of electroweak (EW) production of a W boson in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The data sample was recorded by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The measurement is performed for the \u03bdjj final state (with \u03bd indicating a lepton-neutrino pair, and j representing the quarks produced in the hard interaction) in a kinematic region defined by invariant mass m jj > 120 GeV and transverse momenta p Tj > 25 GeV. The cross section of the process is measured in the electron and muon channels yielding \u03c3 EW (Wjj) = 6.23 \u00b1 0.12 (stat) \u00b1 0.61 (syst) pb per channel, in agreement with leading-order standard model predictions. The additional hadronic activity of events in a signal-enriched region is studied, and the measurements are compared with predictions. The final state is also used to perform a search for anomalous trilinear gauge couplings. Limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are given in the framework of an effective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are \u22122.3 < c WWW /\u039b 2 < 2.5 TeV \u22122 , \u22128.8 < c W /\u039b 2 < 16 TeV \u22122 , and \u221245 < c B /\u039b 2 < 46 TeV \u22122 . These results are combined with the CMS EW Zjj analysis, yielding the constraint on the c WWW coupling: \u22121.8 < c WWW /\u039b 2 < 2.0 TeV \u22122 .",

            "text": "In proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC, the pure electroweak (EW) production of a lepton-neutrino pair ( \u03bd) in association with two jets (jj) includes production via vector boson fusion (VBF). This process has a distinctive signature of two jets with large energy and separation in pseudorapidity (\u03b7), produced in association with a lepton-neutrino pair. This EW process is referred to as EW Wjj, and the two jets e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch produced through the fragmentation of the outgoing quarks are referred to as \"tagging jets\". Figure 1 shows representative Feynman diagrams for the EW Wjj signal processes, namely VBF ( Fig. 1, left), bremsstrahlung-like ( Fig. 1, center), and multiperipheral ( Fig. 1, right) production. Gauge cancellations lead to a large negative interference between the VBF diagram and the other two diagrams, with the larger interference coming from bremsstrahlung-like production. Interference with multiperipheral production is limited to cases where the leptonneutrino pair mass is close to the W boson mass.",

The signal is defined in the kinematic region with parton transverse momentum p Tj > 25 GeV, and diparton invariant mass m jj > 120 GeV. The simulated cross section for the \u03bdjj final state (with = e, \u03bc or \u03c4 ), applying the above requirements, is \u03c3 LO (EW \u03bdjj) = 6.81 +0.03 \u22120.06 (scale) \u00b1 0.26 (PDFs) pb, where the first uncertainty is obtained by changing simultaneously the factorization (\u03bc F ) and renormalization (\u03bc R ) scales by factors of 2 and 1/2, and the second one reflects the uncertainties in the NNPDF30 PDFs. The LO signal cross section and relevant kinematic distributions estimated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo are in agreement within 2-5% with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) predictions of the vbfnlo generator (v2.6.3) [25][26][27], which include QCD NLO corrections to the LO ME-level diagrams evaluated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo. For additional comparisons, signal events produced with MadGraph5_amc@nlo are also processed with the herwig++ (v2.7.1) [28] PS, using the EE5C [29] tune.",

The uncertainty in the energy of the jets affects the event selection and the computation of the kinematic variables used to calculate the discriminants. Therefore, the uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES) affects both the expected event yields and the final shapes. The effect of the JES uncertainty is studied by rescaling up and down the reconstructed jet energy by p T -and \u03b7-dependent scale factors [57]. An analogous approach is used for the JER.

Shape variations corresponding to the full differences between the data and the simulation are used as estimates of the uncertainty. Pileup. Pileup can affect the identification and isolation of the leptons or the corrected energy of the jets. When the jet clustering algorithm is run, pileup can distort the reconstructed dijet system because of the contamination of tracks and calorimetric deposits. This uncertainty is evaluated by generating alternative distributions of the number of pileup interactions, corresponding to a 4.6% uncertainty in the total inelastic pp cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV [67].

The expected limits are subsequently improved by 20-25% with respect to the expected limits without a BDT selection. In each channel, four bins from 0 < p T < 1. To construct the p T templates, the associated weights calculated for each event are used to construct a parametrized model of the expected yield in each bin as a function of the values of the dimension-six operators' coupling constants. For each bin, the ratios of the expected signal yield with dimension-six operators to the one without (leaving only the SM contribution) are fitted at each point of the grid to a quadratic polynomial. The highest p T bin has the largest statistical power to detect the presence of higher-dimensional operators.

Figure 19 shows the gap activity veto efficiency of combined muon and electron events in the signal-enriched region when placing an upper threshold on the p T of the additional third jet, on the H T of all additional jets, on the leading soft-activity jet p T , or on the soft-activity H T . The observed efficiency in data is compared to expected efficiencies for background-only events, and efficiencies for background plus signal events where the signal is modeled with pythia or herwig++. Data points clearly disfavor the backgroundonly predictions and are in reasonable agreement with the presence of the signal with the herwig++ PS predictions for gap activities above 20 GeV, while the signal with pythia PS seems to generally overestimate the gap activity. In the events with very low gap activity, in particular below 10 GeV as measured with the soft track jets, the data indicates gap activities also below the herwig++ PS predictions. In addition, the expected efficiencies are included for background plus signal events where the signal is modeled with powheg (Sect. 3) with herwig++ PS.
