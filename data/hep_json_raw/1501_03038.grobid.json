For the first time several observables are measured in the dielectron mass squared (q 2 ) interval between 0.002 and 1.120 GeV 2 /c 4 . The angular observables F L and A Re T which are related to the K * 0 polarisation and to the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, are measured to be F L = 0.16 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.03 and A Re T = 0.10 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b1 0.05, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The angular observables A 2T and A Im T which are sensitive to the photon polarisation in this q 2 range, are found to be A (2) T = \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b1 0.05 and A Im T = 0.14 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.05. The results are consistent with Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "The B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 decay is a flavour changing neutral current process that is mediated by electroweak box and loop diagrams in the Standard Model (SM). Charge conjugation is implied throughout this paper unless stated otherwise and the K * 0 represents the K * 0 (892), reconstructed as K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . The angular distribution of the K + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 system is particularly sensitive to contributions from non-SM physics (NP). The leading SM diagrams are shown in figure 1; the relative contribution of each of the diagrams varies with the dilepton invariant mass. In the region where the dilepton invariant mass squared (q 2 ) is less than 6 GeV 2 /c 4 , some theoretical uncertainties from long distance contributions are greatly reduced, thereby allowing more control over the SM prediction and increasing sensitivity to any NP effect [1,2]. Furthermore, the contribution from a virtual photon coupling to the lepton pair dominates in the very low q 2 region, allowing measurement of the helicity of the photon in b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions [3,4]. In the SM, this photon is predominantly left-handed, with a small right-handed component arising from the mass of the s quark and long distance effects. In contrast, in many extension of the SM, NP may manifest as a large right handed current, see for example refs. [5][6][7][8].  The q 2 region below 1 GeV 2 /c 4 has previously been studied through the analysis of the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 + \u2212 ( = e, \u00b5) [9][10][11]. Experimentally, an analysis with muons rather than electrons in the final state produces a much higher yield at LHCb. This is primarily due to the distinctive signature that muons provide, which is efficiently exploited in the online selection, together with the better mass and energy resolutions and higher reconstruction efficiency of dimuon decays. However, as outlined in ref. [12], dielectron decays at low q 2 provide greater sensitivity to the photon polarisation and therefore to the C 7 and C 7 Wilson coefficients, which are associated with the left-handed and right-handed electromagnetic operators, respectively [3]. Due to the muon mass, the virtual photon contribution in dimuon decays is suppressed relative to dielectron decays. Additionally, the formalism for the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 decay is greatly simplified as the electron mass can be neglected. Indeed, the decay with electrons allows for an angular analysis down to a q 2 of 0.0004 GeV 2 /c 4 . However, above a q 2 of 1 GeV 2 /c 4 , the muon mass terms become negligible and the electron and muon modes have essentially the same functional dependence on the Wilson coefficients (within the lepton flavour universality assumption).",

These definitions are identical to those used for the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 analysis [10]. As in ref.

This transformation cancels out the terms that have a sin \u03c6 or cos \u03c6 dependence and simplifies the angular expression without any loss of sensitivity to the remaining observables.

The LHCb detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [20], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [21] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [22]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [23].",

If photons are emitted upstream of the magnet, the electron momentum is evaluated after photon emission, and the measured B 0 mass is shifted. In general, these bremsstrahlung photons deposit their energy in different calorimeter cells than those hit by the electron. In both cases, the ratio of the energy detected in the ECAL to the momentum measured by the tracking system, an important variable in identifying electrons, remains unbiased. To improve the momentum reconstruction, a dedicated bremsstrahlung recovery is used.

If the same bremsstrahlung photon is associated with both the e + and the e \u2212 , its energy is added randomly to one of the tracks. The reconstructed e + e \u2212 invariant mass is required to be in the range 20-1000 MeV/c 2 (0.0004 < q 2 < 1 GeV 2 /c 4 ). The choice of the lower bound is a compromise between the gain in sensitivity to the photon polarisation from measuring as low as possible in q 2 and a degradation of the resolution in\u03c6 as q 2 decreases, due to multiple scattering, as shown in figure 2. The lower bound requirement at 20 MeV/c 2 on the e + e \u2212 invariant mass also serves to reduce the background from B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 decays followed by a photon conversion in the material, noted below as B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 e + e \u2212 .

When more than one PV is reconstructed, the one giving the smallest IP \u03c7 2 for the B 0 candidate is chosen. The reconstructed decay vertex of the B 0 candidate is required to be significantly separated from the PV and the candidate momentum direction to be consistent with its direction of flight from the PV. The B 0 mass resolution, the angular acceptance and the rates of physics and combinatorial backgrounds depend on how the event was triggered. The data sample is therefore divided into three mutually exclusive categories: events for which one of the electrons from the B 0 decay satisfies the hardware electron trigger, events for which one of the hadrons from the B 0 decay satisfies the hardware hadron trigger and events triggered by activity in the event not due to any of the signal decay particles.",

In LHCb, approximately 40% of the photons convert before reaching the calorimeter, and although only about 10% are reconstructed as an e + e \u2212 pair with hits in the vertex detector, the resulting mass of the B 0 candidate peaks in the signal region. Two very effective criteria for suppressing this background are the minimum requirement on the e + e \u2212 invariant mass, m(e + e \u2212 ) > 20 MeV/c 2 , and a requirement that the uncertainty of the reconstructed z coordinate of the e + e \u2212 pair, \u03c3 z (e + e \u2212 ), is less than 30 mm. These requirements reject more than 99% of simulated B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 events. The remaining contamination is estimated by normalising the simulated B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 e + e \u2212 to the observed yield without the \u03c3 z (e + e \u2212 ) criterion and requiring the e + e \u2212 invariant mass to be lower than 5 MeV/c 2 . The residual contamination from B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 decays is (3.8 \u00b1 1.9)% of the signal yield. Part of this background comes from low-mass e + e \u2212 pairs that are reconstructed at larger masses due to multiple scattering. The remainder comes from direct Bethe-Heitler pair-production at masses larger than 20 MeV/c 2 . To obtain an accurate estimate of this component, the Geant4 simulation is reweighted as a function of the true e + e \u2212 mass to match the distribution of ref. [37] since Geant4 does not model correctly the high-mass e + e \u2212 pair production.",

The fractions of each component are determined from unbinned maximum likelihood fits to the mass distributions separately for each trigger category. The mass distribution of each category is fitted to a sum of probability density functions (PDFs), modelling the different components. Following the strategy of ref. [39], the signal PDF depends on the number of neutral clusters that are added to the dielectron candidate to correct for the effects of bremsstrahlung. The signal is described by the sum of a Crystal Ball function [40] (CB) and a wide Gaussian function accounting for the cases where background photons have been associated; the CB function accounts for over 90% of the total signal PDF.

The three corresponding one-dimensional angular distributions for the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 decay are distorted by the geometrical acceptance of the detector, the trigger, the event reconstruction and the selection. Furthermore, their precise shapes depend upon the various trigger categories, each being enriched in events with different kinematic properties. For the\u03c6 angle, a uniform acceptance is expected. However, there are distortions in both the cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 K distributions, mainly arising from requirements on the transverse momenta of the particles. The cos \u03b8 K acceptance is asymmetric due to the momentum imbalance between the kaon and the pion from the K * 0 decay in the laboratory frame due to their different masses. The cos \u03b8 K and cos \u03b8 acceptance distributions are modelled on simulated B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 events with Legendre polynomials of fourth order.

The effect of this correlation is extracted from a sample of data events selected with a looser BDT requirement but excluding the region of the BDT response corresponding to the signal.

This method assumes that there is no strong correlation between the BDT response and m(K + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ).

The inclusion of m(K + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) in the fit strongly improves its statistical power since the level of background varies significantly within the signal mass window. The fit is performed simultaneously on the three trigger categories sharing the fit parameters associated with the angular observables. The mass PDFs for the three components (signal, PR background and combinatorial background) are obtained from the fit described in section 5. The angular PDFs for the signal are obtained by multiplying the formula of eq. 1.1 by the acceptance described in section 6. Similarly, the angular PDFs for the PR background are modelled by using eq. 1.1 and the acceptance described in section 6 and setting F L,PR = 0.33 and A 2T,PR = A Im T,PR = A Re T,PR = 0. Finally, the angular PDFs for the combinatorial background are described in section 6. The combinatorial and PR background fractions are constrained to the values calculated from the mass fit described in section 5. The fit is validated using a large number of pseudo-experiments that include all the components of the fits. Several input values for the angular observables, F L , A 2T , A Im T and A Re T , are studied including those associated with NP models, and the fit results are in good agreement with the inputs. The fitting procedure is also verified using a large sample of fully simulated events; the fitted values of F L , A (2) T , A Im T and A Re T are in excellent agreement with the generated ones. This validates not only the fit but also the assumption that the angular acceptance factorises. The distributions of m(K + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ), cos \u03b8 , cos \u03b8 K and\u03c6, together with the likelihood projections resulting from the fit, are shown in figure 4 and the fit results are given in table 1.

Taking into account the effect of event migration in and out the q 2 bin, the average value of the true q 2 of the selected signal events is equal to q 2 = 0.17 \u00b1 0.04 GeV 2 /c 4 . The acceptance as a function of the true q 2 , obtained from the LHCb simulation, is uniform in a large domain except close to the limits of the reconstructed q 2 , 0.0004 and 1 GeV 2 /c 4 . Due to reconstruction effects, the q 2 effective limits are slightly different. Because of reduced acceptance in the low-q 2 region, the value of the lower q 2 effective limit is increased; because of bremsstrahlung radiation, events with a true q 2 greater than 1 GeV 2 /c 4 are accepted by the selection and the higher q 2 effective limit is also increased. The values of these effective boundaries are obtained by requiring that in the low-and high-q 2 regions the same number of events are obtained in a uniform acceptance model and in the LHCb simulation. The true q 2 effective region is thus determined to be between 0.002 and 1.12 GeV 2 /c 4 . It is checked, using the LHCb simulation, that the average values of the true q 2 and of the angular observables evaluated with a uniform acceptance in the region between 0.002 and 1.12 GeV 2 /c 4 are in agreement with those obtained from the angular fit performed on the events selected in -13 -  Figure 5: Distribution of the reconstructed q 2 from an sPlot of data (black points).
