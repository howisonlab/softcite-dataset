The data analysis takes into account the interference between the resonant and non-resonant DD production, where the latter is related to the non-resonant part of the energy-dependent form factor F D . The vector dominance approach and several empirical parameterizations have been tried for the nonresonant F NR D (s). where the first, second and third uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and model, respectively. The mass value obtained is consistent with that of BaBar [5], which also took interference into account, not incompatible with the mass measurements in B meson decays and significantly higher than that of BES [6], which did not take into account interference effects. For the electron partial width two possible solutions have been found: It is shown that taking into account the resonance-continuum interference in the near-threshold region affects resonance parameters, thus the results presented can not be directly compared with the corresponding PDG values obtained ignoring this effect.",
