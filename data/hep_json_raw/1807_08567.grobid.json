Various studies of its properties have been performed [3][4][5][6][7], and no significant deviation from the SM predictions has been found. The SM Higgs boson is a strong probe of physics beyond the SM. This paper documents searches for both nonresonant and resonant production of Higgs boson pairs (H H) in the semileptonic \u03b3 \u03b3 W W * final state using 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton ( pp) collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. Previous searches for Higgs boson pair production have been performed by both the ATLAS   [16]. No significant excess was observed compared to the SM prediction. However, it is important to explore the 13 TeV data in the channels that are not covered yet, such as the \u03b3 \u03b3 W W * channel presented in this paper. Although this decay channel is not the most sensitive amongst all possible Higgs boson decays, it relies on the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons, which are already relatively well measured. Furthermore, this channel will contribute to the final combination of all measurable H H decays.",

Heavy resonances, other than heavy Higgs bosons, that can decay into a pair of SM Higgs bosons, are predicted in different models, and could for instance be gravitons [25], radions [26] or stoponium [27]. This paper reports searches for non-resonant and resonant production of pairs of Higgs bosons in the semileptonic \u03b3 \u03b3 W W * final state (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03bd j j), i.e. with two photons, two jets, one charged lepton and a neutrino. This final state benefits from the large branching fraction of H \u2192W W * [17], a characteristic signature from two photons and one lepton, as well as the excellent resolution of the diphoton invariant mass m \u03b3 \u03b3 , which provides good discrimination from a smooth continuum background composed of multi-photon and multi-jet SM processes. Given the expected sensitivity in 13 TeV data, the di-Higgs-boson mass range between 260 and 500 GeV is explored in the search for a scalar resonant Higgs boson pair production.",

The two datasets were recorded at the same centre-of-mass energy \u221a s =13 TeV, albeit with different beam conditions. Beam intensities in 2016 were typically higher than in 2015, resulting in a higher instantaneous luminosity and a larger number of pp collisions in each bunch crossing. The integrated luminosity of the combined 2015+2016 dataset used in this analysis is 36.1 \u00b1 0.8 fb \u22121 . This dataset were collected in run periods during which all subsystems were operational. The events are collected with a trigger requiring the presence of at least two photons, one with a transverse energy E T > 35 GeV and the second with E T > 25 GeV, and the longitudinal and transverse profiles of the EM shower were required to be consistent with those expected for a photon. The corresponding trigger efficiency reaches about 99% for the events that pass the event selection of the analysis. 3.2 Simulated event samples Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples are used to estimate the signal acceptance and study the modelling for both nonresonant SM Higgs boson pair production and resonant BSM Higgs boson pair production. MC samples are also used to estimate the acceptance and study the modelling for SM single-Higgs-boson production processes, and to study the modelling of the SM continuum background from events with multiple photons and jets (Sect. 5), which is the dominant background in the analysis. Eventually, it is estimated by a data-driven method for both its normalisation and shape. The simulated samples for signals are listed in Table 1. The event generator MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.2.3 [31] was used for the production of non-resonant [32] and resonant [33] signal MC samples at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD, where four values of the resonance mass (m X = 260, 300, 400 and 500 GeV) are considered. The events were generated by a Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) using the MC@NLO method [34] and were reweighted in order to take into account the effects of the finite top-quark mass. The parton shower was implemented using Herwig++ 2.7.1 [35] with a set of tuned underlying-event parameters called the UEEE5 tune 2 [36], and the parton distribution function (PDF) set CTEQ6L1 [37] was used.  \u2022 gluon-gluon fusion: The ggF production is accurate to NNLO in QCD, using the Powheg method [41] for matching the matrix element with the parton shower, and the MiNLO method [42,43] to simultaneously achieve NLO accuracy for inclusive Higgs boson production. Furthermore, a reweighting procedure was performed using the HNNLO program [44][45][46] to achieve full NNLO accuracy [47]. This sample is referred to as NNLOPS. The PDF4LHC15 NLO PDF set [48] was used. The inclusive cross section of the ggF production is normalised to the calculation at next-to-next-to-next-toleading-order (N 3 LO) QCD and NLO electroweak (EW) accuracies [49]. \u2022 VBF and VH: VBF and V H production was simulated at NLO in QCD with Powheg-Box v2 [41,50,51] using the PDF4LHC15 NLO PDF set. The inclusive VBF contribution is normalised to the cross section calculated with NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections [52][53][54] with an approximate NNLO QCD correction applied [55]. The contributions are normalised to cross sections calculated with NNLO QCD [56] and NLO EW corrections [57] for W H and qq \u2192 Z H and at NLO and next-to-leadinglogarithm (NLL) accuracy in QCD for gg \u2192 Z H [58]. \u2022 ttH: The tt H production is simulated using Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO 2.2.3 and its inclusive cross section is normalised to a calculation with NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections [59][60][61][62].",

If the candidates are matched with a reconstructed conversion vertex or tracks consistent with the hypothesis of a \u03b3 \u2192e + e \u2212 conversion, they are classified as converted photon candidates. 3 If the matched track is consistent with the hypothesis of an electron produced in the beam interaction region, they are classified as electron candidates. If the candidates are not matched with a reconstructed conversion vertex or tracks satisfying the conversion requirement, they are classified as unconverted photon candidates. The energy is determined by summing the energies of all cells that belong to the associated cluster [68] and is corrected using a combination of simulation-based and data-driven calibration factors [69] determined from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events collected in 2015 and 2016. The photon energy resolution in simulation is corrected to match the resolution in data [67]. The reconstructed photon candidates are required to meet \"tight\" photon identification criteria [68], which are based on the lateral and longitudinal energy profiles of EM showers in the calorimeter. The identification efficiency is measured as a function of the transverse energy of photons (E \u03b3 T ). It ranges from 90 to 98% for converted photons and from 85 to 95% for unconverted photons, in the E \u03b3 T interval between 25 and 200 GeV. To suppress the background from jets misidentified as photons, all reconstructed photon candidates are required to meet a set of calorimeterand track-based isolation criteria [70]. A calorimeter-based isolation variable E iso T is defined as the sum of the transverse energies (E T ) of all positive-energy topological clusters of calorimeter cells [71] within R = 0.2 of the photon candidate, excluding the energy of the photon candidate itself. The selection applied to the calorimeter-based isolation variable is E iso T < 0.065E \u03b3 T . A track-based isolation variable p iso T is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta ( p T ) of tracks with p T > 1 GeV within R = 0.2 of the photon candidate, excluding tracks from photon conversions. The selection on the track-based isolation variable is p iso T < 0.05E \u03b3 T .

A likelihood-based (LH) algorithm is used [72] to perform the electron identification against the background from jets or non-prompt electrons. Electron candidates are identified according to the \"medium LH\" criteria. Muon candidates are identified by matching a reconstructed ID track with a reconstructed MS track [73]. The identification classifies muon candidates as either \"loose\" or \"medium\", based on the number of hits in the different ID and MS subsystems, and on the significance of the difference |q/ p MS \u2212 q/ p ID |, where q is the charge and p is the momentum of the muon candidate, as well as on the energy deposit in the tile hadronic calorimeters. The \"medium\" candidates are used in the analysis. An efficiency ranging from 84 to 93% as a function of E T or p T is achieved in the combined identification and reconstruction of electrons, and 96% (above 98%) in muon identification (reconstruction), in the range where the objects are selected. The electron (muon) is required to pass the \"Loose\" (\"GradientLoose\") isolation criterion based on the sum of p T of tracks lying within a cone of R = min (10 GeV/ p e(\u03bc) T , 0.3) and the sum of E T of topological clusters of calorimeter cells within a cone of R = 0.2 (0.2) around the electron (muon) candidate, excluding the contributions from the electron (muon) candidate. With these requirements the isolation efficiencies for electrons (muons) are above 99% (0.057 p \u03bc T + 95.57%) [72,73]. Finally, the electron candidates are required to have E T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47, excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52), whereas the muon candidates are required to have p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.7.",

Jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 25 GeV. In addition, a jet-vertex tagging algorithm (JVT) [81] is applied to jets with |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T < 60 GeV in order to suppress jets originating from pile-up interactions. In this algorithm, a multivariate discriminant based on two track-based variables is constructed to reject pile-up jets while maintaining a high efficiency for the hard-scatter jet independent of the number of primary vertices in the event. The selected jets are classified as b-jets using a multivariate technique [82,83], which takes advantage of the information about secondary vertices, the impact parameters of the associated tracks and the topologies of decays of heavy-flavour hadrons.

Several functional forms were evaluated by fitting the sidebands in data and MC samples under different conditions of photon purity and lepton multiplicity. Photon purity was lowered, compared to the final data selection, by reversing the requirements on photon isolation or identification. For higher photon purity, MC samples with prompt photons were used. The lepton multiplicity was varied to be zero or at least one. For all combinations of conditions, the exponential function with a second-order polynomial gave the best fits, with satisfactory \u03c7 2 , and was chosen to model the continuum background.

The uncertainties in the modelling are estimated by fitting a signal-plus-background model to a simulated background-only sample that has such a large number of events that its own statistical uncertainty does not affect the test results. The fitted number of signal events (n ss ) quantifies spurious signal events. The fits are performed with the assumed m H ranging from 120 to 130 GeV in steps of 0.5 GeV. The maximum value of the fitted signal yields |n ss | is regarded as a bias in the yields due to the background modelling (the spurious signal), and is, conservatively, taken into account in the fit as the modelling uncertainty. The fitted |n ss | value reaches as large as 0.46 when not applying the p \u03b3 \u03b3 T selection, and 0.26 when applying the selection.

The photon identification uncertainty is obtained by varying the data-to-simulation efficiency corrections within their uncertainties, derived from control samples of photons from radiative Z boson decays and from inclusive \u03b3 events, and of electrons from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays. A maximal uncertainty of 1.7% in the yields is evaluated in all of the SM single-Higgs-boson, SM di-Higgs-boson and BSM Higgs boson production processes. The photon-track isolation uncertainty is derived from measurements of the uncertainty in the data-to-simulation efficiency corrections using inclusive-photon control samples, while the uncertainty from the calorimeter isolation requirement is evaluated from the difference between applying and not applying corrections derived from inclusive-photon events to the calorimeter isolation variable in the simulation. In general, the overall isolation uncertainty is less than 1%. The uncertainties from the photon energy resolution and scale affect the yields by less than 0.2%. The relevant impact on the shape of the diphoton invariant mass is also considered by introducing variations of the resolution and mean values of the fit function and is estimated using simulation. The photon energy resolution varies the resolution of the m \u03b3 \u03b3 shape by 5.2-11.4%, while the photon energy scale affects the mean value by about 0.5%. The jet energy scale (JES) and the corresponding uncertainties are derived from both simulation and in situ calibration using data [77,90]. This affects the event selection efficiency by 2.4-9.9%, depending on the process. The jet energy resolution (JER) uncertainty is evaluated by smearing jet energies according to the systematic uncertainties of the resolution measurement [80,91], and its impact on the event selection efficiency ranges from 0.1 to 1.6%. The b-tagging uncertainties is derived separately for b-jets, c-jets and light-flavour jets [82]. Overall, their impact on the yields is not more than 4%. Uncertainties arising from the reconstruction, identification and isolation of both the electron and muon candidates [72,73], are propagated to the event yield variations, and they are found to have an impact of less than 1%. Finally, the pile-up reweighting procedure, which matches the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing between simulation and data, has associated systematic uncertainties of less than 1%. All experimental uncertainties are correlated among all processes that use simulation to model the yields and the kinematics. A summary of the systematic uncertainties in the expected yields of the di-Higgs-boson and single-Higgs-boson production is presented in Table 5. In the search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production, SM Higgs boson pair production is Table 5 Summary of relative systematic uncertainties, in percent, propagated to the yields for the MC-estimated processes. Entries marked by '-' indicate that the systematic uncertainty is not applicable for the corresponding process. The extrapolation uncertainties in b-tagging include two components: one is from the extrapolation to highp T ( p T > 300 GeV) jets and the other one is from extrapolating c-jets to \u03c4 -jets. The values for resonant production shown here assume m X = 260 GeV. Several theoretical uncertainties are reported for the cross section (\u03c3 ) and the combined efficiency and acceptance ( \u00d7 A) considered to be the signal process, while single Higgs boson production is considered to be a background. In the search for the resonant Higgs boson pair production, both SM single Higgs boson production and non-resonant Higgs boson pair productions are considered to be background processes.",

            "text": "Equation (1) is used directly for the BSM resonant signal searches. For the non-resonant SM Higgs boson pair search, the SM Higgs boson pair term is removed. The distributions in the final signal-plus-background fit using the likelihood function above are shown for two sets of selections separately: in Fig. 3a without requiring the p \u03b3 \u03b3 T selection for masses below 400 GeV, and in Fig. 3b requiring p \u03b3 \u03b3 T > 100 GeV for masses above 400 GeV, as well as for the search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. The fits are performed separately on the two distributions to search for resonant signals in both the low-mass and high-mass ranges. The observed data are found to be compatible with the sum of the expected SM backgrounds by performing a likelihood-ratio test [92]. The largest data excess has a local significance of 2.0 standard deviations at 400 GeV without the p \u03b3 \u03b3 T selection. A modified frequentist method CL s [93] is used to calculate the 95% confidencelevel (CL) exclusion limits with the asymptotic approximation [92]. Unfolding the SM Higgs boson branching fractions to W W * and \u03b3 \u03b3 for the signal, the expected upper limit on the cross section for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is 5.4 pb, while the observed limit is 7.7 pb, as shown in Table 6. The difference between the expected and observed limits is due to a slight excess of events in data. The expected upper limit on the cross section times the branching fraction of X \u2192 H H ranges from 17.6 to 4.4 pb, while the observed limit ranges from 40 to 6.1 pb, as a function of m X between 260 and 500 GeV, as shown in Fig. 4a.",

No significant excess above the expected SM background is observed. A 95% confidence-level upper limit of 7.7 pb is set on the cross section for non-resonant production, while the expected limit is 5.4 pb, compared to the SM Higgs boson pair production cross section of 33.4 fb. The observed upper limit on the resonant production cross section times the branching fraction of X \u2192 H H ranges between 40 pb and 6.1 pb, while the expected limit ranges between 17.6 and 4.4 pb, for a hypothetical resonance with a mass in the range of 260-500 GeV. When deriving the limits above, the SM branching ratios of the H \u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 and H \u2192W W * are assumed.
