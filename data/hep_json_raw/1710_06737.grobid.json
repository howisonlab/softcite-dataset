In certain extensions of the Standard Model, such as the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), sizeable anomalous top quark dipole moments can arise, that may be revealed by a precise measurement of top quark pair production. We present results from detailed Monte Carlo studies for the ILC at 500 GeV and CLIC at 380 GeV and use parton-level simulations to explore the potential of high-energy operation. We find that precise measurements in e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt production with subsequent decay to lepton plus jets final states can provide sufficient sensitivity to detect Higgs-boson-induced CP violation in a viable two-Higgsdoublet model. The potential of a linear e + e \u2212 collider to detect CP-violating electric and weak dipole form factors of the top quark exceeds the prospects of the HL-LHC by over an order of magnitude.",

Its large mass implies that it is the Standard Model particle that is most strongly coupled to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. The top quark is also set apart from the other quarks in that it does not form hadronic bound-states -that is, it offers the possibility to study the interactions of a bare quark. The experimental investigation of single top and top-quark pair production at the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has led to a precise knowledge of the top-quark strong and weak charged-current interactions. These results are in good agreement with the Standard Model (SM) predictions.",

At the LHC an accurate measurement of the top-quark neutral current couplings to the photon (\u03b3) and Z boson is challenging, because tt pairs are dominantly produced by the strong interactions, and the associated production of tt and a hard photon or Z boson is relatively rare compared to the production of tt + jets. Future lepton colliders will offer the opportunity to precisely explore these top-quark interactions. The studies in Refs. [1,2,3,4,5,6] have shown that linear collider (LC) experiments can measure the top-quark electroweak couplings with very competitive precision.",

New physics that affects top-quark production and/or decay is parametrized in terms of form factors that depend on kinematic invariants. The Standard Model predicts CP violation in top-quark pair production and decay to be very small, well beyond the experimental sensitivity of existing and planned facilities (see the discussion in Section 9). Some extensions of the SM, such as, for instance, two-Higgs-doublet models, can give rise to sizeable effects [12]. Any observation of CP violation in the top-quark sector would be clear evidence of physics beyond the SM. Early studies of non-standard CP violation (i.e. CP violation that is not induced by the Kobayashi-Maskawa CP phase) in e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt include those in Refs. [13,14,15]. Our study is based on the observables proposed in Ref. [16] for the lepton plus jets final states that have a direct sensitivity to the electric and weak dipole form factors of the top quark. We present the first result of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of these observables in a realistic experimental environment.",

However, by using EFT for describing new physics one assumes that there is a gap between the typical energy scale of the process under consideration ( \u221a s in our case) and the scale of new physics. This is not the case for the models that we consider in the next section. In particular, in the kinematic domain that we are interested in, d \u03b3 t and d Z t show a non-negligible dependence on \u221a s and can develop absorptive parts, therefore becoming complex.",

We are interested in 2HDM parameter scenarios where the couplings of the h j to top quarks are not suppressed as compared to the corresponding SM Yukawa coupling. This is the case for tan \u03b2 \u223c 1 or somewhat lower than one. Moreover, we assume that the two other neutral Higgs bosons h 2 , h 3 are significantly heavier than h 1 . In the type-II 2HDM and for tan \u03b2 < 1 the Yukawa couplings of the h j to b quarks and \u03c4 leptons are suppressed as compared to the corresponding SM Yukawa couplings, cf. Table 1. Moreover, the constraint that h 1 has SM-like couplings to weak gauge bosons implies that the couplings of h 2 , h 3 to W W and ZZ are small, irrespective of the CP nature of these Higgs bosons. This follows from a sum rule, cf., for instance, [20]. 2HDM parameter scenarios with tan \u03b2 1 and h 2 , h 3 masses equal or larger than about 500 GeV are compatible with the non-observation of heavy neutral Higgs bosons at the LHC in final states with electroweak gauge bosons [28,29,30,31,32], b quarks [33,34], charged leptons [35,36], and top quarks [37].

            "text": "In order to assess the potential size of the form factors F X 2A (s) (X = \u03b3, Z) in type-II 2HDM with Higgs sector CP violation we make a scan over the independent parameters that are of relevance for this analysis. In the kinematic range \u221a s 500 GeV the most important contribution to the top-quark EDF and WDF arise from h 1 exchange if this Higgs boson has top-quark Yukawa couplings such that the modulus of the product a 1t b 1t is about one. We take into account recent constraints on the couplings of h 1 to W, Z, t, b, \u03c4 [24] and the experimental constraints on the masses and couplings of h 2 , h 3 from Ref. [22,23,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. We vary tan \u03b2 in the range 0.35 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 1 and the three Higgs mixing angles in the range \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b1 i \u2264 \u03c0/2, determine the resulting reduced Yukawa couplings a jf , b jf and the couplings f jV V of the h j to ZZ. A benchmark set of resulting couplings is given in Table 1. Somewhat tighter constraints on the CP-violating top-Higgs couplings were derived in Ref. [39]. For calculating the form factors F X 2A (s) we assume that the Higgs bosons h 2 and h 3 are heavier than 500 GeV. For definiteness we set their masses to be 1200 GeV and 600 GeV, respectively. Using the formulae of Ref. [21], m t = 173 GeV, and the values of the Higgs couplings of Table 1, the real and imaginary parts of F X 2A (s) are shown as functions of the c.m. energy in Fig. 1. In the kinematic range displayed in these plots the imaginary part of the EDF is about three times larger than that of the WDF. This holds true also for the real parts of the form factors close to the tt threshold, while they become significantly smaller in magnitude around \u221a s = 500 GeV due to the strong fall-off of the dominant contribution from h 1 . The values of the real and imaginary parts of these form factors are listed in Table 2   In the kinematic range that we are interested in ( \u221a s 500 GeV) the imaginary parts of the EDF and WDF are rather insensitive to the values of the heavy Higgs-boson masses, as long as m 2,3 > 500 GeV. This is also the case for the real parts of the form factors close to the tt threshold that are dominated by the contribution from h 1 exchange. This term falls off strongly with increasing c.m. energy. Moreover, at c.m. energies \u221a s 500 GeV the contributions from h 2 , h 3 to the real parts of the form factors may no longer be negligible. We find that the real parts of the EDF and WDF at \u221a s = 500 GeV depend, for fixed Higgs-boson Table 2: Values of the real and imaginary parts of the top-quark EDF and WDF for two c.m. energies. Input parameters are as in Fig. 1.",

Nevertheless, the MSSM contains in its general form many CP-violating phases besides the KM phase, especially in the supersymmetry-breaking terms of the model, including phases of the complex Majorana mass terms of the neutral gauginos and of the complex chargino and sfermion mass matrices. Motivated by assumptions about SUSY breaking at very high energies, one often puts constraints on the SUSY-breaking terms, in particular on the CP-violating phases, in order to restrict the number of unknown parameters of the model. Nevertheless, generic features of SUSY CP violation remain. Unlike the case of Higgs-boson induced one-loop EDMs, fermion EDMs generated at one-loop can be large, also for u, d quarks and the electron. The experimental upper bounds on the EDM of the neutron and of atoms/molecules strongly constrain in particular the CP-phases associated with the sfermion mass matrices of the first and second generation, barring fine-tuned cancellations. See, for instance, Ref. [40] for a review. However, the phases of the sfermion mass matrices need not be flavour-universal. For the top flavour the associated phase \u03d5t can still be of order one. Often a common phase of the gaugino masses is assumed. Using phase redefinitions of the fields in the MSSM Lagrangian, one can choose for the parametrization of MSSM CP violation in the top-quark sector [41,42] the phase \u03d5t, the corresponding bflavour phase \u03d5b, and the phase \u03d5\u00b5 = arg(\u00b5) of the so-called \u00b5 term in the MSSM Lagrangian that generates a Dirac mass of the higgsinos. For a rather recent analysis of constraints on the CP-violating phases in the MSSM, see Ref. [43].",

We analyzed the potential size of CP-violating effects in tt production in e + e \u2212 collisions and subsequent t andt decay within two popular and motivated SM extensions, taking into account present experimental constraints. As to the BSM scenarios investigated above, an extended Higgs sector with CP-violating neutral Higgs boson exchange has the largest potential to generate observable effects in this reaction. If the observed h 1 (125GeV) Higgs resonance has both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings to top quarks whose strengths are of order one compared to the SM top Yukawa coupling then the magnitude of Im F \u03b3 2A can be \u223c 1% in the energy range \u221a s 500 GeV that we consider in the following. The real part of this form factor can become of the same order of magnitude near the tt threshold. The real and imaginary parts of the top-quark WDF are in general smaller by a factor of about 0.3, cf. Table 2. Within the MSSM the top-quark EDF and WDF are smaller, with maximum values compatible with current experimental constraints below 10 \u22123 . The CP-violating form factors in the t \u2192 W b decay amplitude that can be generated within the 2HDM or the MSSM are very small and of no further interest to us here. Moreover, we recall that within the 2HDM there are no CP-violating box contributions to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt amplitude to one-loop approximation if the electron mass is neglected. These results motivate the use of the parametrization of Eq. (1) in the simulations of the following sections.",

If one considers the dileptonic decay channels, tt \u2192 + \u2212 + ..., then it is appropriate to consider CP-odd dileptonic angular correlations [15], which efficiently trace CP-odd tt spin correlations. We recall the well-known fact that the charged lepton in semi-leptonic t ort decay is by far the best analyzer of the top spin. Here we consider tt decay to lepton plus jets final states which yield more events than the dileptonic channels and, moreover, allow for a straightforward experimental reconstruction of the t andt rest frames. For these final states the most efficient way to probe for CP-violating effects in tt production is to construct observables that result from t andt single-spin momentum correlations, that is, from correlations which involve only the spin of the semi-leptonically decaying t ort. Here, we adopt the observables proposed in [16] for detecting these correlations in lepton plus jets final states.",

The decay of boosted top quarks produces a topology [68] that is very different from that of tt events close to the production threshold. Therefore, the reconstruction of the 1-3 TeV collisions must be performed with an algorithm specifically developed for high energy, where the collimated decay products of the hadronic top quark are captured in a single large-R jet (i.e. a jet reconstructed with a radius parameter R greater than 1).

Also the jet mass and other substructure observables can be reconstructed precisely, with much better resolution than at the LHC.

These effects are labelled as non-linearity in the following. They are evaluated in a parton-level study using events generated with non-zero WDF and EDF. Distributions and asymmetries with non-zero values of the top-quark EDF and WDF are generated using a MadGraph [70] UFO model developed in Ref. [72]. The most important cuts in the analysis, namely on the charged lepton energy, its isolation, and the polar angle of final-state quarks are applied to the six-fermion final state. The finite resolution in the reconstruction of the hadronic top-quark candidate is implemented by smearing the top-quark three-momentum vector. The migrations due to ambiguities in pairing b-jets and W -bosons at low energy are simulated by implementing the incorrect pairing for 15% of events. The selection tends to enhance the reconstructed asymmetry. This effect is particularly pronounced at very high centre-of-mass energy, where it can reach up to 10% of the true asymmetry (for \u221a s = 3 TeV). Migrations and resolution effects dilute the asymmetry, yielding reconstructed values that are reduced by 5-15%.

The next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections have been known for a long time [73]. The NLO electroweak corrections were determined in Refs. [74,75,76]. Off-shell tt production and decay including non-resonant and interference contributions at NLO QCD were investigated in Ref. [77]. The NNLO QCD corrections to tt production, including differential distributions, were calculated in [78,79]. Although not done in this work, the coefficients of ReF \u03b3 ,Z 2A and ImF \u03b3,Z 2A in the asymmetries of Equations (15) and (16) can be computed at NLO in the SM couplings. We can then estimate the theory uncertainties of these coefficients as follows. The uncertainty of the tt cross section associated with renormalization scale variations in the range  [79]. Assuming that the NLO SM corrections to the squared matrix element including the EDF and WDF to tt production and decay are known, we take these NLO QCD values as theory uncertainties. They are labeled \"theory (non-linearity)\" in Table 7. We believe that these uncertainty estimates are not unrealistic because the uncertainties of these coefficients are, in fact, associated with the expectation values O Re \u00b1 , O Im \u00b1 , which are ratios that are usually expanded in powers of the SM couplings. QCD scale uncertainties of expanded ratios are in general smaller than the scale uncertainty of the cross section. An example is the top-quark forward-backward asymmetry A t FB which is known to NNLO QCD accuracy [78,79]. The scale uncertainty of the expanded A t FB is below 0.5% at these c.m. energies [79]. The numbers in the row \"theory (bias)\" in Table 7 are a very conservative estimate of CP-violating SM contributions induced by higher-order W -boson exchange to e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt. At one loop in the electroweak couplings there are no CP-violating SM contributions to this flavour-diagonal reaction. Beyond one loop the CPviolating SM contributions to the asymmetries of Equations (15), (16) are smaller than [g 2 W /(16\u03c0 2 )] 2 ImJ, where g W = e/ sin \u03b8 W and ImJ is the imaginary part of a product of four quark mixing-matrix elements, which is invariant under phase-changes of the quark fields.

These are indicated as the expected relative modification of the asymmetry, with the label \"(non-linearity)\".

In both cases an integrated luminosity of 500 fb \u22121 is assumed. We find that both projects have a very similar sensitivity to these form factors, reaching limits of |F \u03b3 2A | < 0.01 for the EDF. Assuming that systematic uncertainties can be controlled to the required level a luminosity upgrade of either of these machines may bring a further improvement.

However, with mild assumptions measurements that yield information about the W tb vertex can be recast into limits on the form factors of the \u03b3tt and Ztt interactions. In a dimension-six effective-operator framework based on the SM gauge symmetry [18,87,88] the operator O tW (with Wilson coefficient C tW ) generates an anomalous chirality-flipping coupling g R of the W -boson (cf. Section 3.3) and non-zero values for the real part of the F \u03b3,Z 2A form factors in e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt production. We use this approach to convert constraints from measurements of the W-helicity fractions in top-quark decay [89,90,91], of the single top production cross sections, and from studies of the polarization of W -boson in t-channel single-top production [92,52] into constraints on F \u03b3,Z",
