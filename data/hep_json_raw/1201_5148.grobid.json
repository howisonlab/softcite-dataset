Due to the heavy mass, the top quark plays an important role in electroweak radiative corrections relating the top quark mass (M top ) and the W boson mass to the mass of the predicted Higgs boson [3,4]. The lifetime of the top quark is about 20 times shorter than the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not form hadrons, giving us a unique opportunity to study a \"bare\" quark.",

The topology of tt events depends on the different decay of the two W bosons. In the dilepton channel, each W boson decay to charged lepton (electron and muon) and neutrino. Events in this channel thus contain two leptons, two b-quark jets, and two undetected neutrinos. Because of the presence of two leptons, this channel has the lowest background. However the dilepton channel has the smallest branching fraction. In the all-jets channel, each W boson decays to two jets so that this channel contains two b quark jets and four light quark jets. This channel has the largest branching fraction but also the largest background from QCD multijet production. The lepton+jets channel has one W boson decaying leptonically and the other hadronically so that we have one charged lepton, two b-quark jets, two light quark jets, and one undetected neutrino. Because of the relatively large branching fraction with manageable backgrounds, lepton+jets channel is considered as the \"golden channel\" in the top quark studies. By this reason, the most results presented here use the lepton+jets final state.",

The template method (TM) uses the distributions of variables (templates) which are strongly correlated with the top quark mass and jet energy scale (JES). In the building of a probability, only a few variables (usually less than two) are used, for instance reconstructed top quark mass and dijet mass of hardronic decay W boson in the lepton+jets channel. The Matrix Element Method (ME) uses event's probability to be a combinates signals and background. ME exploit all the information in the event by using a leading order matrix element calculation convoluted with parton distribution function and transfer functions (TFs) making connection between detector response and parton level particle. Because we can use all the information of tt production and decay in principle, ME usually provide better precision of M top than TM. Both techniques employ likelihood to compare data to the modeling of signals and background to extract M top .",

In the lepton+jets and all-jets channels the uncertainty from JES can be reduced by using the reconstructed dijet mass from hadronically decaying W boson with in situ calibration of JES. To date the most precise measurement has been performed by CDF collaboration using lep-ton+jets channel with ME. We found M top =173.0\u00b11.2 GeV/c 2 with 5.6 fb \u22121 of the data [6]. D0 carried out the most precise M top measurement in the dilepton channel using TM. We built templates of the reconstructed top quark mass distributions and extract M top = 173.3 \u00b1 3.2 GeV/c 2 using 5.3 fb \u22121 data [7]. CDF have interesting measurements using all hadronic final state with and without large missing energy. The large missing energy and jets final state is mostly originated from lepton+jets events but, lepton is not reconstructed by hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton or going outside of detector coverage. These events have not been used for M top measurement and CDF firstly start use it to measure M top = 172.3 \u00b1 2.6 GeV/c 2 with 5.7 fb \u22121 of data [8].

            "text": "The SM predicts that the top quark decays almost entirely to a W boson and a bottom quark, and that the Wtb vertex is a V-A charged weak current interaction. A consequence of this is that approximately 70% of the top quark decay longitudinally, 30% of the top quarks have left handed polarization (f 0 = 70%, f \u2212 =30%, f + =0%) [21]. Any new particles involved in the same decay topologies and nonstandard coupling could create a different mixture of polarized W bosons. Therefore, a measurement of this fraction is a test of the V-A nature of the Wtb vertex. D0 collaboration uses both lepton+jets and dilepton channel simultaneously with 4.3 fb \u22121 data and extracts f + = 0.02 \u00b1 0.05 and f 0 = 0.67 \u00b1 0.10 with the simultaneous fit of the two variables [22]. CDF collaboration has results in both lep-ton+jets [23] and dilepton channels [24]. All three different measurement are combined to get f + = \u22120.013 \u00b1 0.035 fb A -0.  and f 0 = 0.685 \u00b1 0.057 which is consistent with the SM prediction as one can see in Fig. 2 (right).",
