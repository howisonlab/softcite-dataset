The data are used to reconstruct the lowest few (N = 2, 4 and 6) moments of F2 in the three prominent nucleon resonance regions, as well as the moments integrated over the entire resonance region. Comparison with moments computed from global parametrizations of parton distribution functions suggest that quark-hadron duality holds locally for the neutron in the second and third resonance regions down to Q 2 \u2248 1 GeV 2 , with violations possibly up to 20% observed in the first resonance region.",

Here, the low energy cross section, when averaged over appropriate energy intervals, is found to resemble the high energy result, whose Q 2 dependence is described by perturbative QCD. In this context, quark-hadron duality provides a unique perspective on the relationship between confinement and asymptotic freedom, and establishes a critical link between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of QCD.",

            "text": "In the framework of QCD, quark-hadron duality can be formally interpreted in terms of structure function mo-ments [3]. From the operator product expansion (OPE), the moments can be expressed as a series in 1/Q 2 , with coefficients given by matrix elements of local quark-gluon operators of a given twist [4]. The leading (twist 2) term corresponds to scattering from a single parton, while higher twist terms correspond to multi-quark and quarkgluon interactions. At low Q 2 the resonance region makes a significant contribution to the structure function moments, so that here one might expect a strong Q 2 dependence of the moments arising from the higher twist terms in the OPE. In practice, however, the similarity of the structure function moments at low Q 2 and the moments extracted from high energy cross sections suggests the dominance of the leading twist contribution. The combined higher twist, multi-parton contributions appear to play a relatively minor role down to scales of the order",

            "text": "To establish the dynamical origin of quark-hadron duality in the nucleon requires one to also study the low-Q 2 structure of the neutron. Models based on four-quark higher twist contributions to DIS suggest that duality in the proton could arise from accidental cancellations between quark charges, which would not occur for the neutron [19]. Unfortunately, the absence of high-density free neutron targets means that essentially all information on the structure functions of the neutron has had to be derived from measurements on deuterium. Typically, the deuterium data are corrected for Fermi smearing and other nuclear effects [20][21][22][23][24][25][26], which introduces an element of model dependence into the extraction procedure. This is particularly problematic in the nucleon resonance region, where Fermi motion effects leads to significant smearing of the resonant structures. The existence of duality in the neutron F 2 structure function was suggested recently [20] in an analysis which used an iterative deconvolution method [27] to extract neutron resonance spectra from inclusive proton and deuteron F 2 data [9]. A model independent confirmation of duality in the neutron, however, was to date not possible.",

By detecting low-momentum protons at backward angles in electron deuteron scattering, the BONuS experiment at Jefferson Lab measured F 2 for the neutron in both the resonance and DIS regions, with minimal uncertainty from nuclear smearing and rescattering corrections [30]. In the present work, we use the BONuS data to quantitatively measure for the first time the degree to which duality holds for the F 2 structure function of the free neutron. Because the results reported here use data from an experimentally-isolated neutron target, one expects significantly reduced systematic uncertainties compared with those in the model-dependent analysis of inclusive deuterium data [20].",

The experiment and data analysis are described in detail in Ref. [30]. Ratios of neutron to proton F 2 structure functions and the absolute neutron F 2 structure function were extracted over a wide kinematic range and for spectator proton momenta between 70 and 100 MeV. The total point-to-point systematic uncertainty in the neutron structure function extracted was 8.7% [30]. This value includes a 2% uncertainty associated with the radiative corrections and a 5% uncertainty associated with the detector acceptance and efficiency.

The numerical values for the moments are also listed in Table I. The quoted errors take into account the experimental statistical and random uncertainties added in quadrature, but do not include the overall 10% systematic uncertainty. The typical truncated moment shown in Fig. 3 is obtained by integrating over eight or more structure function measurements. Thus the relative uncertainty of the truncated moment is smaller with respect to the relative random uncertainty of any individual structure function data point, and ranges between 2% and 4% for the N = 2 moments. As shown in Fig. 1 the kinematic coverage of the data over the Q 2 \u2212 x range studied is dense, the largest x span over which inter or extrapolation had to be carried out was 0.03. Thus the extrapolation errors for the (N = 2 or larger) moments is fairly small, somewhat larger for the higher moments (due to the higher powers of x in the integrand) as reflected in the uncertainties given in Tables II and III. The experimental moments are compared with the moments calculated from the ABKM global PDF parametrization [42], including finite-Q 2 corrections from the target mass and an x-dependent parameterization of the leading (O(1/Q 2 )) higher twist effects. The latter are needed in order to obtain a more quantitative description of duality in the low-Q 2 region, to which the structure functions from the global fits (which are primarily constrained by high energy data) are extrapolated. The comparison shows generally very good agreement in the second and third resonance regions, and in the total integrated W 2 interval, while the ABKM results underestimate the data somewhat in the \u2206 resonance region.",

The errors shown do not include the overall 10% normalization uncertainty.  though the deviation in the lowest-W interval is more pronounced, especially at low Q 2 , because of the greater weighting given to the high-x region in the higher moments. Note that while early phenomenological analyses of quark-hadron duality typically compared resonance region data at low Q 2 with scaling functions extrapolated from fits to high-W cross sections [5,6], more recent quantitative analyses [9,20] have emphasized the need to take into account the Q 2 dependence in the high-W data, including both leading and higher twist contributions. This is especially important in the high-x region, where the separation between the leading and higher twists is more model dependent due to the absence of high-Q 2 measurements, and comparison of resonance region data with the total extrapolated structure functions reveals an enhanced persistence of duality down to lower values of Q 2 .",

The ratios for the M n 2 moments are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of Q 2 for the four invariant mass regions in Eq. (2). The ratios for the second, third and total resonance regions are close to unity, to within \u223c 10% over nearly the entire range of Q 2 = 1 \u2212 4 GeV 2 , and exhibit weak scale dependence. This points to a dramatic confirmation of the validity of local duality for the neutron in these regions. In the first resonance region, the \u2206 resonance is \u223c 20% \u2212 30% larger than the PDF-based fit, but still displays a similar Q 2 behavior. This could be interpreted as either a stronger violation of local duality in the \u2206 region, which may be expected at lower W , or possibly underestimated strength of the ABKM parametrization in the large-x regime, to which this W region corresponds. While this is difficult to disentangle experimentally, duality is expected to hold to better accuracy for integrals obtained over regions containing multiple final states.",

This conclusion was also reached in the model-  dependent analysis by Malace et al. [20], who studied duality in the neutron by extracting the F n 2 structure function from inclusive DIS data using phenomenological deuteron wave functions and an iterative deconvolution procedure [27]. Overall, the BONuS data are in good agreement with the earlier results [20], within the experimental uncertainties, although they appear to lie systematically higher in the \u2206 region. This may be associated with the nuclear corrections in the deuteron, which are subject to greater uncertainties at the largest x (smallest W ) values, or a systematic bias of the subtraction method in relation to the various theoretical assumptions and models [21].",

While the ratio of the ABKM and CJ moments is close to unity over the entire range of Q 2 considered when finite-Q 2 effects are included, the deviation from unity of the ratio computed from only the leading twist components of the CJ fit can be up to 30% \u2212 40% for the integrated resonance region, and up to twice as much for the \u2206 region.

In the limit of exact isospin symmetry, the transitions from a ground state nucleon to an isospin-3/2 resonance would be identical for protons and neutrons. Nonresonant background and isospin symmetry breaking contributions give rise to differences between proton and neutron moments, but these are typically very small in the \u2206 region. In contrast, the proton and neutron deep-inelastic structure functions (either leading twist only or with higher twist corrections) in the \u2206 region are expected to be quite different, since at large x the neutron structure function is strongly suppressed relative to the proton, F n 2 F p 2 [49,50]. The fact that the experimental M n 2 /M p 2 ratio in the high-x region lies somewhat higher than the DIS parametrization (even more pronounced than in Ref.

This is due to the small couplings to octet spin-1/2 states. In contrast, according to Refs.

While there was some evidence for such a pattern from the earlier, model-dependent analysis of inclusive data [20], there is no indication from the BONuS results of a suppression 2 /M p 2 of neutron to proton truncated moments of the F2 structure function versus Q 2 , for the four W regions in Eq.

The corresponding enhancement of the proton data in the third resonance region relative to the ABKM fit [7,9] then results in essentially no deviation of the neutron to proton ratio here, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Finally, for the total integrated region between threshold and W = 2 GeV, the empirical M n 2 /M p 2 ratio is slightly above the DIS result mostly because of the large enhancement of the data in the \u2206 region.",

Comparison of the exper-imental moments with moments computed from global parametrizations of PDFs fitted to deep-inelastic and other high energy scattering data, as well as with the corresponding truncated moments for the proton, reveals a dramatic confirmation of local duality for the neutron in the second, third and total resonance regions to better than 10% for the lowest moment. The stronger (\u223c 20%\u221230%) violation of duality in the \u2206 region is consistent with the expectations based on isospin symmetry for the isovector transition amplitudes and the behavior of the F n 2 /F p 2 ratio at large x [43,50]. The confirmation of local duality in the neutron disfavors the model [19] in which duality in the proton arises through accidental cancellations of quark charges associated with higher twist, four-quark operators, which would predict strong duality violations in the neutron. Rather, it suggests a dynamical origin of duality in which cancellations among nucleon resonances produce a higher degree of duality over the entire resonance region, with stronger violations locally [45,46,51]. On the other hand, detailed comparisons between the empirical truncated moments and DIS parametrizations in the individual resonance regions suggest a pattern of duality violation that is more involved than that predicted by simple spin-flavor symmetric quark models with magnetic coupling dominance.",
