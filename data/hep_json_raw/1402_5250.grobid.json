            "text": "A facility that can deliver beams of electron and muon neutrinos from the decay of a stored muon beam has the potential to unambiguously resolve the issue of the evidence for light sterile neutrinos that arises in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments and from estimates of the effective number of neutrino flavors from fits to cosmological data. In this paper, we show that the nuSTORM facility, with stored muons of 3.8 GeV=c AE 10%, will be able to carry out a conclusive muon neutrino appearance search for sterile neutrinos and test the LSND and MiniBooNE experimental signals with 10\u03c3 sensitivity, even assuming conservative estimates for the systematic uncertainties. This experiment would add greatly to our knowledge of the contribution of light sterile neutrinos to the number of effective neutrino flavors from the abundance of primordial helium production and from constraints on neutrino energy density from the cosmic microwave background. The appearance search is complemented by a simultaneous muon neutrino disappearance analysis that will facilitate tests of various sterile neutrino models. The issue of light sterile neutrinos is one of general interest to particle physicists and cosmologists. Intriguing evidence from terrestrial neutrino sources exists for neutrino mixing between the three active neutrinos and light sterile neutrino species. Short-baseline neutrino oscillations observed by the LSND [1] and MiniBooNE [2] experiments, the collective evidence of the reactor neutrino anomaly [3] and the gallium anomaly [4][5][6][7][8] all point towards sterile neutrinos with masses at the electronvolt level. While these results are tantalizing, they are not conclusive on their own and there is tension with the disappearance searches, which exclude the best-fit light neutrino [9,10]. Furthermore, estimates of the effective number of neutrino flavors [11,12] from fits to cosmological data suggest that this number is greater than three. These results are based on primordial helium production during big-bang nucleosynthesis and constraints on neutrino energy density from the cosmic microwave background. Assumptions based on the partial thermalization of the primordial neutrino species [13] and the inclusion of uncertainties in the Hubble constant [14] can be used to accommodate all the available data. Therefore, there is great interest to resolve the issue of the existence of light sterile neutrinos, with implications for particle physics and cosmology.",

This idea has evolved from previous neutrino factory work carried out in the context of sterile neutrino (2 \u00fe 2) and (3 \u00fe 1) models [17][18][19]. We will show in this article that the currently proposed nuSTORM accelerator facility is feasible, without the need for new technology, and that the analysis presented is realistic, in terms of the detector performance. The best sensitivity to sterile neutrinos can be achieved with the \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bc oscillation channel, conjugate to the LSND measurement, but the simultaneous access to disappearance modes can be used to test the consistency of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis for the first time in a single experiment.",

The primary decay mode, \u03bc \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe \u03bd e\u03bd\u03bc , is 98.6% of all muon decays. The remainder is made up of radiative decays, \u03bc \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe \u03bd e\u03bd\u03bc \u03b3 (B.R. \u2248 1.4%), and \u03bc \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe e \u2212 e \u00fe \u03bd e\u03bd\u03bc (B.R. \u00bc \u00f03.4 AE 0.4\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) [20]. These decays all have the same neutrino content (50% \u03bd e , 50%\u03bd \u03bc ), so any difference in the neutrino flavor would represent new physics. The energy spectrum of the muon decay positron has been measured to be consistent with the standard model at the level of a few parts in 10 4 [21]. The nuSTORM facility has been designed to inject 5 GeV pions into a muon storage ring [22], with a beam lattice in a race track configuration (Fig. 1). The effective straight for neutrino production is 185 m long and includes pion injection and extraction sections. The total circumference of the ring is 480 m. The storage ring circulates muons with a central momentum of 3.8 GeV=c and has a momentum acceptance of \u2248 AE 10%. Pions that do not decay prior to the first bend and muons produced from pion decay in the forward direction are removed by an extraction section at the end of the straight. Since the muons circulate many times between pion fills, neutrinos from pion decay are separated from the sample of neutrinos purely from muon decays through the use of a time cut that isolates decays immediately after injection. Muons that decay in the bends or in the opposing straight do not produce useful neutrinos. It is expected that \u22482 \u00d7 10 18 useful muon decays in the production straight that points toward the far detector site can be generated by nuSTORM from a total of 10 21 protons on target (POT) over a total of ten years [22,23]. The neutrino beam has a dispersion of 29 mrad from the boost of the muon decay and 4 mrad muon beam divergence in the production straight. The uncertainty in the neutrino flux is expected to be less than 0.5%, due to the measurements to be carried out by beam monitoring devices in the decay run and at a near detector.",

Therefore, the sensitivity to oscillations depends on the ability of the detector to distinguish the charge of the leptons produced in the neutrino charged current (CC) interactions. With the rates shown in Table I, a background acceptance of 10 \u22124 is required for an appearance measurement. Direct measurement of the cross sections of both electron and muon neutrinos can be measured at a near detector site 50 m from the end of the decay straight. The number of \u03bd e and\u03bd \u03bc CC events (per 100 ton fiducial mass at the near detector) is 4.0 \u00d7 10 6 and 2.1 \u00d7 10 6 , respectively, for a 10 21 POT exposure. It is also possible to select \u03bc \u2212 in the storage ring. This will yield a lower rate in the detection of appearance oscillations, and hence a reduced sensitivity, due to the difference in the cross section between neutrinos and antineutrinos (1.8 \u00d7 10 6\u03bd e and 4.6 \u00d7 10 6 \u03bd \u03bc CC events would be observed in the near detector in this case). A 1.3 kt magnetized iron-scintillator calorimeter has been selected as the detector for short-baseline oscillation physics at nuSTORM, as it has excellent charge selection and detection characteristics for muons. This 6 m diameter detector is to be constructed of modules of 1.5 cm thick steel plates, and two layers of scintillator bars to yield 3 D space points at each measurement plane. The overall length of this detector is 13 m. Each scintillator bar has a cross section of 2.0 \u00d7 0.75 cm 2 and will be read out using silicon photomultipliers. For a schematic of this detector, see Fig. 2. The magnetic field will be generated by a 240 kA-turns current carried by 8 turns of a superconducting transmission line. This provides a toroidal magnetic field between 1.9 and 2.6 T within the steel.",

Muons that decay in the injection straight during subsequent turns produce the neutrino beam. A detailed simulation of the iron-scintillator far detector was developed from the neutrino factory far detector simulation [25]. This simulation uses the GENIE [26] package to simulate neutrino interactions in iron and scintillator, and GEANT4 [27] to simulate the interactions of the products with the detector material. A simple digitization is used to group ionization sites to particular paired scintillator bars and replicate the effects of resolution and attenuation within the scintillator bars. Tracks are reconstructed from the events through repeated application of a Kalman filter [28] to determine the momentum and charge of tracks. Multiple tracks are fit from each event and the longest track is defined as the muon. Other tracks, if present, are assumed to be the result of pion production and other particle shower processes. A track is reconstructed from pion or shower events in 1% of cases, necessitating further analysis to remove such events.",

A series of cuts to perform a preselection of events were applied first. These are based on finding one or more tracks in the event; on successfully fitting the longest track; imposing a maximum momentum p \u03bc < 4 GeV=c for the longest track; applying a fiducial cut in which the longest track must start before the last 1 m of the detector; 60% of the hits assigned must be associated to the longest track; the relative error on the ratio q=p, where q and p are the fitted charge and momentum of the track, must satisfy \u03c3 q=p =\u00f0q=p\u00de < 10.0; and the ratio of the initial curvature over the fitted curvature satisfies \u00f0q init =p init \u00de\u00d7 \u00f0p=q\u00de > 0. An approach was used based on the boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm provided by the toolkit for mulitvariate analysis (TMVA) [29] subset of the ROOT [30] analysis package in which five track variables (shown in Table II) are used to discriminate between muons from \u03bd \u03bc CC interactions and all other types of interactions. The method reduces these five track variables to one classifier variable that runs between 0 and 1, based on a training process that differentiates between \u03bd \u03bc CC events, the experimental signal, and\u03bd \u03bc neutral current (NC) events, representing the experimental backgrounds. The trained multivariate analysis (MVA) is applied to simulations corresponding to the entries in Fig. 3(a) to determine the detector response to signal (S) and background (B) events. Given the expected number of oscillated and unoscillated neutrinos at the far detector, an optimal signal significance -quantified as S= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi S \u00fe B p -is achieved for an appearance experiment when the classifier is restricted to values greater than 0.86. This yields an integrated signal efficiency of 0.17 and a background efficiency of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . This background is predominantly due to charge misidentification from \u03bd \u03bc CC events, but also contains pion decay and punch through from NC events. A cuts-based analysis was also studied [22,31], based on the number of hits in a trajectory and the track quality, but yielded a decreased physics sensitivity, with a signal efficiency of 0.16 and a background efficiency of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at a higher energy threshold.",

Cosmic ray backgrounds were also considered through the application of the CRY software package [37]. With the application of self-vetoing cuts on the fiducial volume to a skin depth of 30 cm, the cosmic ray background is reduced to less than 1 event per year. A simultaneous and statistically independent\u03bd \u03bc disappearance measurement will be conducted with the same experimental setup. Sensitivity contours as a function of \u0394m 2 14 and sin 2 2\u03b8 \u03bc\u03bc are shown in Fig. 5. A near detector is essential to extrapolate the expected neutrino flux at the far detector [38,39]. It is assumed that the systematic uncertainties used in the appearance measurement are the same as those for the disappearance measurement. The\u03bd \u03bc disappearance measurement is far more sensitive to systematic uncertainties due to the increase of the signal and background acceptance. The exclusion contours set by the nuSTORM disappearance measurement alone shows improvement in the 99% C.L. bounds over the current global fits as in Fig. 5. The true sensitivity is expected to fall between the pessimistic and optimistic cases, because the inclusion of the flux extrapolation from the 200 Tonne near detector is expected to introduce similar systematic uncertainties while it constrains the spectral uncertainty. The simulation of the near detector required to test this assertion is in progress. An optimization of a \u03bd e disappearance experiment at a similar muon storage ring facility with idealized detector systems was carried out, demonstrating the near-far extrapolation [40], but the realistic assessment of this channel is still in progress.",

In this article, we have demonstrated that the nuSTORM facility can deliver high purity beams of neutrinos to carry out a \u03bd e to \u03bd \u03bc neutrino oscillation appearance measurement, using an ironscintillator calorimeter detector at a distance of 2 km, with a signal significance of better than 10\u03c3. The simultaneous use of the\u03bd \u03bc disappearance channel grants nuSTORM added potential to resolve the current tension between appearance and disappearance measurements and potential to resolve differences between sterile neutrino models. The experimental sensitivity of the appearance channel is largely robust to systematic effects. Therefore, this experiment would be able to provide the definitive test for light sterile neutrinos and resolve a long-standing problem. . Sensitivity of nuSTORM to \u03bd \u03bc disappearance oscillations assuming a (3 \u00fe 1) neutrino model. Contours are generated from a \u03c7 2 statistic assuming both the anticipated and inflated systematic uncertainties compared to the exclusion contour produced from the fit of sin 2 2\u03b8 \u03bc\u03bc and \u0394m 2 to the existing disappearance data (blue dots) [24].",
