For charmonia production, the cross-section can be predicted in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and at the leading order (LO) is proportional to the square of the gluon parton distribution function (PDF), which ensures a steep rise in the photoproduction cross-section with the centre-of-mass energy of the photon-proton system, W . Therefore, measurements of CEP of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons provide not only a test of perturbative QCD but also probe the pomeron, and constrain the gluon PDF.",

The LHCb collaboration has previously measured the CEP of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV [11]. In this paper, those results are extended to \u221a s = 13 TeV and charmonia are measured up to W = 2 TeV, the highest energy yet explored. This corresponds to probing the gluon PDF down to a fractional momentum of the proton, described by the Bjorken variable x \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , a scale at which saturation effects may become visible [12].",

In Regge theory [13,14], b varies with W according to b = b 0 + 4\u03b1 log(W/W 0 ), where b 0 is the slope measured at an energy W 0 . Measurements at HERA determined \u03b1 = 0.164 \u00b1 0.041 GeV \u22122 with b 0 = 4.63 +0.07 \u22120.17 GeV \u22122 for J/\u03c8 photoproduction at W 0 = 90 GeV [6]. In pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, LHCb measured b = 5.70 \u00b1 0.11 GeV \u22122 at an average value of W = 750 GeV [11]. According to Regge theory, a value of b \u2248 6.1 GeV \u22122 is expected for J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. In inelastic J/\u03c8 production when proton dissociation occurs, the fall-off with t is more gradual. In contrast, the nonresonant ultraperipheral electromagnetic CEP of dimuons, produced through photon-photon fusion, peaks strongly at low t values. Therefore, the t dependence of the cross-section can be used to distinguish and study different production mechanisms.",

The power of HeRSCheL to discriminate CEP events can be seen in figure 3, which shows the distributions of \u03c7 2 HRC for three classes of low-multiplicity-triggered events. The first class is CEP-enriched dimuons: events in the nonresonant dimuon sample with p 2 T < 0.01 GeV 2 , which has a purity of 97% for electromagnetic CEP events. The second class, inelastic-enriched J/\u03c8 , applies the nominal J/\u03c8 selections but requires p 2 T > 1 GeV 2 , thus selecting inelastic events with proton dissociation. The third class consists of events with more than four tracks reconstructed. Figure 3 shows that CEP-enriched events have lower values of \u03c7 2 HRC . To select exclusive J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) candidates, it is required that log(\u03c7 2 HRC ) < 3.5; this value is chosen in order to minimise the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty on the total cross-sections.

The fiducial acceptance is determined using SuperCHIC [19] assuming that the polarisation of the meson is the same as that of the photon. The acceptance values in bins of meson rapidity are tabulated in table 4 along with the differential cross-section results. These are plotted in figure 5 and compared to the theoretical calculations of refs. [28,29]. Both measurements are in better agreement with the next-to-LO (NLO) predictions. The \u03c7 2 /ndf for the J/\u03c8 analysis is 8.1/10 while for the \u03c8(2S) analysis, it is 3.0/3.

Equation (6.1) shows that there is a two-fold ambiguity with W + , W \u2212 both contributing to one LHCb rapidity bin. Since the W \u2212 solution contributes about one third and as it has been previously measured at HERA, this term is fixed using the H1 parametrisation of their results [5]: \u03c3 \u03b3p\u2192J/\u03c8p = a(W/90 GeV) \u03b4 with a = 81 \u00b1 3 pb and \u03b4 = 0.67 \u00b1 0.03. For the \u03c8(2S) W \u2212 solution, the H1 J/\u03c8 parametrisation is scaled by 0.166, their measured ratio of \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 cross-sections [8]. The photon flux is taken from ref. [30] and the gap survival probabilities are taken from ref. [31]. With these inputs, which for ease of calculation are reproduced in tables 7 and 8 in the appendix, eq. (6.1) allows the calculation of \u03c3 \u03b3p\u2192\u03c8p at high values of W beyond the kinematic reach of HERA.",

It includes a comparison to H1 [5], ZEUS [7] and ALICE [10] results, and at lower W values fixed target data from E401 [2], E516 [3] and E687 [4]. Also shown are previous LHCb results at \u221a s = 7 TeV, recalculated using improved photon flux and gap survival factors. The 13 TeV LHCb data are in agreement with the 7 TeV results in the kinematic region where they overlap. However, the 13 TeV data extends the W reach to almost 2 TeV. Figure 6 also shows the power-law fit to H1 data [5] and it can be seen that this is insufficient to describe the J/\u03c8 data at the highest energies. In contrast, the data is in good agreement with the JMRT prediction, which takes account of most of the NLO QCD effects [31] and deviates from a simple power-law shape at high W .",

The -14 -  Figure 5. Differential cross-sections compared to LO and NLO theory JMRT predictions [28,29] for the J/\u03c8 meson (top) and the \u03c8(2S) meson (bottom). The inner error bar represents the statistical uncertainty; the outer is the total uncertainty. Since the systematic uncertainty for the \u03c8(2S) meson is negligible with respect to the statistical uncertainty, it is almost not visible in the lower figure. addition of new scintillators in the forward region has resulted in lower backgrounds in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV compared to the previous measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV. As a consequence, the systematic uncertainty on the J/\u03c8 cross-section is reduced from 5.6% at \u221a s = 7 TeV to 2.7% at \u221a s = 13 TeV, reflecting an improved understanding of the background proton-dissociation process. After correcting for the muon acceptance, the cross-sections for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons are compared to theory and found to be in better agreement with the JMRT NLO rather than LO predictions. The derived cross-section for J/\u03c8 photoproduction shows a deviation from a pure powerlaw extrapolation of H1 data, while the \u03c8(2S) results are consistent although more data are required in this channel to make a critical comparison.
