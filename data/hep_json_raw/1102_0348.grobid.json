In the case of the B 0 s when the b \u2192 c transition results in a single charm hadron this can be a D + s , a D * + s or another excited cs state. The relative proportion of these final states provides essential information on the structure of these semileptonic decays, and can be compared with QCDbased theoretical models. In this Letter we present a search for B 0 s semileptonic decays, that might occur via an excited cs meson that disintegrates into final states containing D 0 K + . One such state is the D + s1 , thought to be J P = 1 + , that decays into D * K , and another is the D * + s2 , a possible 2 + state that has been observed to decay directly into D K [1].",

In this Letter the mention of a specific final state will refer also to its chargeconjugate state. The selection techniques are similar to those used in a previous analysis [3]. Most charm hadrons are produced directly via pp \u2192 cc X interactions at the LHC, where X indicates the sum over all other possible final state particles. We denote these particular charm reactions as \"Prompt\". Charm is also produced in pp \u2192 bb X collisions where the b-flavoured hadron decays into charm.

Cherenkov photon angles with respect to the track direction are examined and a likelihood formed for each particle hypothesis [2]. We also require that the p T of the kaons and pion be greater than 300 MeV, and that their scalar sum be greater than 2100 MeV (D + s ) or greater than 1400 MeV (D 0 ). Since charm mesons travel before decaying, the kaon and pion tracks when followed backwards will most often not point to the primary vertex. The impact parameter (IP) is the minimum distance of approach of the track with respect to the primary vertex. We require that the \u03c7 2 formed by using the hypothesis that the IP is equal to zero, \u03c7 2 IP , be > 9 for each track. The kaon and pion candidate tracks must also be consistent with coming from a common origin, the charm decay vertex, with vertex fit \u03c7 2 per number of degrees of freedom (ndof) < 6. This charm candidate's decay vertex must be detached from the closest primary interaction point. The analysis for the D + s X\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd mode follows the same procedure as our previous D 0 X\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd study [3], and uses the 3 pb \u22121 sample. The K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + mass spectra for both the right-sign (RS  vector state cannot decay into two pseudoscalar mesons but this resonance can decay into D * 0 K + . Since we do not reconstruct the \u03b3 or \u03c0 0 from the D * 0 , the mass peak will be shifted down from its nominal value. However, because the resonance is so close to threshold, the mass resolution will still be very good resulting in a narrow peak. This final state was seen previously in B 0 s semileptonic decays by the D0 Collaboration using D + s1 \u2192 D * + K 0 S decays [6]. There also appears to be a feature near the known mass of the D * s2 (2573) + meson. The width of this state is not well measured; the PDG quotes 20 \u00b1 5 MeV [1]. Clearly there is a large excess over the wrong-sign background here evaluated using D 0 K \u2212 mass combinations. s2 where both the mass and width are allowed to float in the fit. We find a mass value of 2559 \u00b1 9 MeV, a width of 24.1 \u00b1 9.2 MeV and 22.1 \u00b1 7.5 events, where all of these uncertainties are statistical only.",

While this sample is useful to increase statistics it suffers from a larger number of interactions per crossing, and multiple triggers, that makes it more difficult to ascertain the total number of B 0 s decays. The measurement of the relative yields of D * + s2 to D + s1 , however, will not be affected. Fig. 2(b) shows the resulting D 0 K + invariant mass spectrum. The difference between RS and WS events outside of the resonant peaks is consistent with background from other b decays as demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulation. We use the same fitting functions as above, but here we allow the mass and average width values of the bifurcated Gaussian to float while still fixing the ratio of widths above and below the peak from simulation. The fit to the D + s1 yields 155 \u00b1 15 signal events, a D 0 K + mass of 2391.6 \u00b1 0.5 MeV, and 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 MeV for the width. For the D * + s2 we again allow the mass, the width and the number of events to float in the fit. We find a mass of 2569.4 \u00b1 1.6 MeV, a width of 12.1 \u00b1 4.5 MeV, and 82 \u00b1 17 events. These errors are purely statistical. The previously measured mass and width values from the PDG are 2572.6 \u00b1 0.9 MeV and 20 \u00b1 5 MeV [1]. The probability of the background fluctuating to form the D * + s2 signal corresponds to eight standard deviations, as determined by the change in twice the natural logarithm of the likelihood of the fit without including this resonance and accounting for the change in the number of degrees of freedom.",

They must also have an invariant mass in the range 3.10 GeV < m(D + s \u03bc \u2212 ) < 5.10 GeV. All of these requirements were decided upon by comparing the sidebands of the invariant mass distributions, representative of the background, with signal Monte Carlo simulation using PYTHIA 6.4 [4] event generation, and the GEANT4 [5] based LHCb detector simulation.",

Here IP refers to the impact parameter of the D + s candidate with respect to the primary vertex in units of mm. For both the RS and WS cases, we perform unbinned extended maximum likelihood fits to the two-dimensional distributions in K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant mass and ln(IP/mm), over a region extending from 80 MeV below the D + s mass peak to 96 MeV above. This fitting procedure allows us to determine directly the background shape from false combinations under the D + s signal mass peak. The parameters of the Prompt IP distribution are found by examining directly produced charm[3]. The Monte Carlo simulated shape is used for the Dfb component. The fit separates contributions from Dfb, Prompt, and false combinations. The Prompt contribution is small. Background components for D * + \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + K + K \u2212 and the reflection from \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay, where either a proton or a pion is wrongly identified as a kaon by the particle identification system, are also included. The shape of the D * + background is constrained to be equal to that of the D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + signal peak and the yield is allowed to float, while the shape of the \u039b + c reflection is determined from Monte Carlo and the yield is allowed to float within the uncertainty of our expectation.Toevaluate more carefully the D + s yield the fits are performed in \u03b7 bins and the detection efficiency in each bin is determined separately so as to remove uncertainty from differences in the \u03b7 dependent production observed in data compared to the Monte Carlo simulation. This procedure yields 2233 \u00b1 60 RS Dfb events in the D + s X\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd channel in the b pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 6, uncorrected for efficiency; the average detection efficiency is (1.07 \u00b1 0.03)%. This yield is then reduced by 5.1% for additional correlated b decay backgrounds as determined by simulation. Measurement of D 0 K + X \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd Semileptonic decays of B 0 s mesons usually result in a D + s meson in the final state. It is possible, however, that the semileptonic decay goes to a cs excitation, which can decay into either D K or D * K resonances, or produces non-resonant D K . To search for these final states, we measure the D 0 K + X\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd yield. To seek events with a D 0 candidate and an additional K + we require that the K + candidate has p T > 300 MeV, be identified as such in the RICH system, has \u03c7 2 IP > 9, and that the vector sum p T of the D 0 and kaon be > 1500 MeV. The resulting partial B candidate must have an invariant mass in the range 3.09 GeV < m(D 0 K + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 5.09 GeV, form a vertex (\u03c7 2 /ndof < 3) and point at the primary vertex (cos \u03b4 > 0.999). In addition, we explicitly check that if the kaon candidate is assigned the pion mass and combined with the D 0 , it does not form a D * + candidate, by requiring the difference in masses m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) \u2212 m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) \u2212 m(\u03c0 + ) > 20 MeV, in addition to the \u00b120 MeV requirement around the D 0 mass for m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ).",
