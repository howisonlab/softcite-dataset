            "text": "The quark model was formulated in 1964 to classify mesons as bound states made of a quark-antiquark pair, and baryons as bound states made of three quarks. For a long time all known mesons and baryons could be classified within this scheme. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), however, in principle also allows the existence of more complex structures, generically called exotic hadrons or simply exotics. These include four-quark hadrons (tetraquarks and hadronic molecules), five-quark hadrons (pentaquarks) and states with active gluonic degrees of freedom (hybrids), and even states of pure glue (glueballs). Exotic hadrons have been systematically searched for in numerous experiments for many years. Remarkably, in the past fifteen years, many new hadrons that do not exhibit the expected properties of ordinary (not exotic) hadrons have been discovered in the quarkonium spectrum. These hadrons are collectively known as XYZ states. Some of them, like the charged states, are undoubtedly exotic. Parallel to the experimental progress, the last decades have also witnessed an enormous theoretical effort to reach a theoretical understanding of the XYZ states. Theoretical approaches include not only phenomenological extensions of the quark model to exotics, but also modern non-relativistic effective field theories and lattice QCD calculations. The present work aims at reviewing the rapid progress in the field of exotic XYZ hadrons over the past few years both in experiments and theory. It concludes with a summary on future prospects and challenges.",

            "text": "Hadrons are described in the Standard Model by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions. QCD is based on the gauge symmetry group SU(3), whose quantum number is called 'color'. At the most fundamental level its degrees of freedom are quarks (q) 1 , antiquarks (q) and gluons (g), the last ones being the SU(3) gauge bosons [1]. The fact that SU(3) is a non-Abelian group makes QCD a very different theory from Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the theory of the electromagnetic interactions, and accordingly the phenomenology of hadrons is very different from the one of atoms. Gluons, in contrast to photons, carry a (color) charge, self-interact, antiscreen the vacuum, and are at the origin of such highly nontrivial phenomena in QCD as asymptotic freedom and color confinement. Asymptotic freedom guarantees that high-energy properties of QCD can be computed in weakcoupling perturbation theory [2,3]. On the other hand, color confinement, which implies that all detected hadrons are singlets (neutral) under color SU (3), sets in at low energies, where weak-coupling perturbation theory fails. Both energy scales are relevant for the formation of heavy hadrons.",

For a long time, all known hadrons could be explained in terms of the quark model where mesons are bound states of a constituent quark and antiquark, and baryons are bound states of three constituent quarks. However, the requirement of color neutrality still allows for more complicated structures, as was already recognised by Gell-Mann in one of the first publications on the quark model [4], likeqqqq,qqqqqq,qqqqq, and so on. In QCD additional states are, in principle, possible like hybrids whose quantum numbers are determined by their quark, antiquark and gluon content: as gluons carry a color charge they can play a much more active role in the formation of a state than photons in atoms. One even expects 'glueballs' whose quantum numbers are determined exclusively by their gluonic content. We will refer to any state which does not appear to fit with the expectations for an ordinaryqq or qqq hadron in the quark model as 'exotic'.",

Nevertheless, at the beginning of the century, no candidates for states beyond ordinary hadrons containing heavy quarks had been found. This was even more the case for mesons made of a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark, called quarkonia: The quark model showed excellent agreement with the data both in the charmonium (cc quarkonia) and in the bottomonium (bb quarkonia) sectors. The situation changed dramatically in 2003 when Belle observed a structure in the \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 final state [5], the X(3872). The properties of the new state did not fit those of an ordinary quarkonium, although it definitely contained a charm-anticharm pair. The assumption that the X(3872) contains the charm-anticharm pair observed in the final state is motivated by the strong suppression of the heavy quark-antiquark pair creation within QCD. After the discovery of the X(3872), many more hadrons were found in processes with final states containing a heavy quark and antiquark, but with properties at odds with those expected for ordinary quarkonia. Among these new states, those that carry an electric charge stick out. Since they must contain, in addition to a heavy quark-antiquark pair, at least a light quark-antiquark pair, they immediately qualify as exotics. For states that from their quantum numbers could be quark-antiquark mesons, but show properties inconsistent with expectations from established quark models, sometimes the term crypto-exotic is used.",

The former class contains hybrids and glueballs. The latter class contains exotics made of a heavy quark and its antiquark together with at least one light quark-antiquark pair. A priori the simplest system consisting of only two quarks and two antiquarks (generically called tetraquarks) is already a very complicated object and it is unclear whether or not any kind of clustering occurs in it. However, to simplify the problem it is common nowadays to focus on certain substructures and investigate their implications: (i) In hadroquarkonia the heavy quark and antiquark form a compact core surrounded by a light-quark cloud. (ii) In compact tetraquarks the relevant degrees of freedom are compact diquarks and antidiquarks. In this review we restrict ourselves to this definition of a compact tetraquark which is quite common in the contemporary literature. It should be mentioned, however, that in the older literature sometimes the phrase \"diquonium\" was used to refer directly to the assumed diquark clustering [8,9]. For a comprehensive review of diquarks we refer to Ref. [10] while for a critical discussion of the diquark clustering in heavy exotics we refer to Ref. [11]. (iii) In hadronic molecules the building blocks are color-neutral hadrons. Obviously a complete picture may include some of or even all these configurations in the final description of the exotic state; nevertheless, the question remains of what is the dominant configuration. Finally, even an ordinary hadron, which has a dominantqq or qqq configuration, will have subleading configurations with additional quark-antiquark pairs and active gluons. Depending on the state, they may turn out to be more or less relevant to describe its properties.",

Both allow for precise and systematically improvable computations that are (to a large extent) model-independent.

The present report focuses on the XYZ states and aims at portraiting, as precisely as possible, the status of the subject in the year 2019. It is organized in the following main sections. In Sec. 2, we review the main experimental facilities participating to the XYZ searches. The status of these searches and the relevant data that have been collected are summarized in Sec. 3. Theoretical methods, ranging from phenomenological quark models to effective field theories of QCD and lattice QCD, and theoretical results and predictions are discussed in Sec. 4. Finally, in Sec. 5 some future prospects both for experiments and theory are highlighted. We close with a short summary.",

As an interesting fact it is worth mentioning that, despite a very rich physics programme at the Belle experiment and many interesting and exciting results obtained by this collaboration for the entire history of its operation, the paper on the discovery of the exotic X(3872) charmoniumlike state turns out to be its most cited publication. Thus it should not come as a surprise that the number of papers on the subject, both experimental and theoretical, including various reviews, grows fast. It is therefore important to make it clear from the very beginning what one will find here that has not been previously discussed. A unique feature of the present review is that it contains simultaneously the most recent experimental information and updates on the exotic states, and a discussion of various aspects of the theoretical interpretation of the existing and foreseen experimental data. In the theoretical part, although various models for exotic states presented in the literature are mentioned and discussed in some detail, the main emphasis is on model-independent approaches based on effective field theories and lattice QCD.",

            "text": "Exotic states that do not seem to fit with expectations of ordinary quarkonia have been dubbed X, Y, and Z in their discovery publications, without any special naming criterion. These names have been used so far in most of the literature on the subject. With the number of XYZ states growing, this way of naming the new states has become increasingly inadequate. For this reason the PDG has recently developed a new naming scheme [6] with the intent to extend the scheme used for ordinary quarkonia, and based on the quark model, to the newly discovered states. The new names carry the information on the J PC quantum numbers of the states. In addition, aside from the ground states, a mass label is added in brackets behind the name symbol. This mass label may deviate from the actual mass whenever updated measurements give shifted mass values compared to the earlier measurements. They do not say anything about the nature of the state, as this is in many cases controversial. For instance, even the X(3872) is not unanimously accepted as an exotic quarkonium. The only exception are the charged states, which clearly require at least a four-quark structure.  Table 1: The PDG naming scheme for quarkonium and quarkonium-like states. For I = 1, C refers to the charge-conjugation quantum number of the neutral state. The quark model for ordinary quarkonia only allows even values of J for the states in the first column, and odd values of J for those in the second one. Moreover, it does not allow a 0 \u2212\u2212 state -see Sec. 4.2. Aside from the \u03b7 Q states with J = 0 and h Q , \u03c8 and \u03a5 states with J = 1, the value of J is added to the name as a subscript. E.g., a state containing acc pair with the quantum numbers 1 \u2212+ is called \u03b7 c1 . Aside from the ground states a mass label is added in brackets to the name symbol. In this table names in brackets indicate that there is no experimentally established state (yet) with the corresponding quantum numbers.",

So far, only for the charged quarkonium-like states new names have been introduced -here the names already used in the literature are used, namely Z c (mass) and Z b (mass) for states containing a charm-anticharm and a bottom-antibottom pair, respectively, with the isospin 1 and J PC = 1 +\u2212 (where C refers to the charge-conjugation quantum number of the neutral member of the isotriplet).",

The BaBar experiment with data samples comparable with Belle could do the same study.

The solid angle for detection of charged tracks and photons was 93% of 4\u03c0. PID information to separate kaon from pion was provided by measurements of ionization (dE/dx) in the CDC and by a cylindrical ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector.",

At the moment the maximum c.m. energy point that BESIII can reach is 4.6 GeV. In a data sample of 525 pb \u22121 collected during one month from December 14, 2012 to January 14, 2013 at the c.m. energy of 4.26 GeV, the charged charmonium-like state Z c (3900) was discovered [22]. This motivated BESIII to focus on c.m. energies above 4 GeV resulting in the largest data sample above 4 GeV for XYZ studies. The data samples for the XYZ study (\"XYZ data\" hereafter) are presented in Table 2.1.4, which lists the nominal c.m. energy, measured c.m. energy (when it is available), and integrated luminosity at each energy point. These data were used for all the analyses presented in this report. BESIII also did a fine scan between 3.8 and 4.6 GeV at more than 100 energy points (\"R-scan data\" hereafter) in 2014, with a total integrated luminosity of about 800 pb \u22121 . This data sample is also used for XYZ studies although the statistics are low [23].

BESIII collects e + e \u2212 annihilation data at c.m. energies that go directly into the production of Y states, while the B factories use data produced via ISR, so BESIII has a much higher detection efficiency and can take more data at any energy of interest [for example, the efficiency is 46% at BESIII [22] and about 10% at Belle [25] for selecting Y(4260) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 + \u2212 ( = e, or \u00b5) events]. This makes the study of the Z c states from the Y decays also more efficient at BESIII than at the B factories. However, B factories can measure the cross sections in a wide energy range since all the events are produced at the same time, while BESIII needs to tune the c.m. energy point by point to collect data, thus can only cover a limited energy range. Finally, the B factories can study the XYZ states with B decays, two-photon fusion, double-charmonium production, and \u03a5(nS ) (n = 1 \u2212 6) decays, while BESIII is limited to e + e \u2212 annihilation.",

Two large general-purpose detectors, CDF [26] and D0 [27], shown in Fig. 6, were taking data. The CDF detector consists of: a silicon detector used to track the paths of charged particles and composed of seven layers of silicon arranged in a barrel shape around the beam pipe; the central outer tracker used to track the paths of charged particles and located within a 1.5 T solenoidal magnetic field; the combined electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter that has approximately uniform granularity in rapidity-azimuthal angle and extends down to 2 \u2022 from the beam direction to measure the energy of light particles and hadrons; the muon detector with four layers of planar drift chambers, each with the capability of detecting muons with a transverse momentum p T > 1.4 GeV. The D0 detector consists of three major subsystems: central tracking detectors, uranium/liquid-argon calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The central tracking system includes a silicon microstrip tracker and a scintillating-fiber tracker located within a 2 T solenoidal magnet to identify displaced vertices for b-quark tagging. The magnetic field enables measurement of the energy-to-momentum ratio for electron identification and calorimeter calibration. The calorimeters were designed to provide energy measurements for electrons, photons, and jets in the absence of a central magnetic field, as well as assist in identification of electrons, photons, jets, and muons and measure the transverse energy balance in events. The outermost layer of the D0 detector is the muon spectrometer consisting of a central muon system proportional drift tubes and toroidal magnets, central scintillation counters, and a forward muon system.

These detectors, shown in Fig. 8, extensively study its properties and simultaneously search for various possible manifestations of new physics beyond the Standard Model. They are also involved in looking for new heavy states. The CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. It is a cylindrical coil of superconducting cables that generates a field of 3.8 T. The complete detector is 21 meters long, 15 meters wide, and 15 meters high. The subdetectors which constitute the CMS detector from inner to outer are inner tracking system to measure the trajectories of charged particles and reconstruct secondary vertices; EMC to measure the energy of electrons and photons; hadronic calorimeter to measure the energy of hadrons; superconducting magnet providing a 3.8 T magnetic field parallel to the beam axis to bend the tracks of charged particles; muon system to identify and measure the trajectories of muons. The ATLAS detector has cylindrical geometry with its central axis coinciding with the beamlines. It is 44 meters in length and 25 meters along the diameter of the transverse round plane, and provides almost full 4\u03c0 solid angle coverage around the collision point. The subdetectors which constitute the ATLAS detector from inner to outer are inner tracking detector which consists of a silicon pixel detector, silicon microstrip tracker and transition radiation tracker to provide good charged-particle tracking reconstruction as well as vertex reconstruction; EMC surrounded by the hadronic calorimeter; solenoid superconducting magnetic system providing a 2 T axial magnetic field; muon spectrometer with a whole coverage up to |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

In this analysis, the most important technique is a correction of the photon energy from B decays by scaling the energy of the photon so that the \u2206E (the energy difference between the beam energy and the reconstructed B candidates) is equal to zero. This improves the \u03b3\u03c7 cJ mass resolution a lot. In the \u03b3\u03c7 c1 mass spectrum for the selected B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 signal candidates, besides the clear \u03c8(2S ) signal, there is a significant narrow peak at 3823 MeV, denoted as \u03c8 2 (3823) . No signal of X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 is seen. After using a Breit-Wigner (BW) function convolved with a mass resolution to parameterize the \u03c8 2 (3823) signal shape, the mass obtained from a simultaneous fit to the selected B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 and B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03b3\u03c7 c1 signal candidates is (3823.1 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 0.7) MeV with a significance of 4.0\u03c3 with systematic uncertainties included, see Fig. 9. The upper limit at 90% confidence level (C.L.) on its width is estimated to be 24 MeV. The \u03c8 2 (3823) mass agrees well with the potential model expectations for \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ). Besides the mass, the measured product of branching fractions B[B \u2192 K\u03c8 2 (3823)]B[\u03c8 2 (3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 ] is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than for the \u03c8(2S ), which also supports the interpretation of the \u03c8 2 (3823) as the \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ) state [44,45]. In the \u03b3\u03c7 c2 mass spectrum, no evidence is found for \u03c8 2 (3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 .",

According to potential models [47][48][49][50][51], the mass of \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ) is in the 3.810 \u223c 3.840 GeV range, which is above the DD mass threshold but below the DD * and DD\u03c0 thresholds. Since the decay \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ) \u2192 DD needs to proceed in a D-wave which would violate parity, the \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ) state is expected to be narrow, and \u03c8 2 (1 3 D 2 ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 should be the dominant decay mode [47][48][49][50][51][52].

The spin-parity quantum numbers J P of the state were restricted to two possibilities, 1 + or 2 \u2212 , by the CDF experiment via an analysis of the angular correlations in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state [57].

Twelve years after the X(3872) was discovered, its spin-parity quantum numbers were finally determined in the LHCb experiment by performing a five-dimensional angular correlation analysis in B + \u2192 K + X(3872), X(3872) \u2192 \u03c1 0 J/\u03c8, \u03c1 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays with 1011 \u00b1 38 events selected from 3 fb \u22121 data at 7 and 8 TeV [58].

Belle also searched for the X(3872) in \u03a5(1S ) inclusive decays [64]. In all these attempts, no apparent X(3872) signal was observed and 90% C.L. upper limits of the production rates in \u03a5(1S , 2S ) decays were set. BESIII reported evidence for X(3872) in Y(4260) radiative decay [65]. It searched for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 with data collected at c.m. energies of 4.01, 4.23, 4.26, and 4.36 GeV [65]. The M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) distribution summed over all energy points, as shown in Fig. 11 (left plot), is fitted to extract the mass and signal yield of X(3872). The solid line shows the best fit with the measured mass of (3871.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.2) MeV and the width of less than 2.4 MeV at the 90% C.L. for the X(3872). The statistical significance of X(3872) is 6.3\u03c3. The measured Born cross sections 2 are shown in Fig. 11 (right plot) with dots with error bars, together with the comparison with a Y(4260) resonance (parameters fixed to PDG [6] values), linear continuum, or E1-transition phase space (\u221d E 3 \u03b3 ) term. The Y(4260) resonance describes the data better than the other two options, which supports the existence of the radiative transition Y(4260) \u2192 \u03b3X(3872). Together with the hadronic transition to the charged charmonium-like state Z c (3900) [22,68,69], this suggests that there might be some common nature of X(3872), Y(4260), and Z c (3900), and so models developed to interpret any one of them should also consider the other two -in fact both the compact tetraquark model, discussed in Sec. 4.3.3, as well as the molecular model, discussed in Sec. 4.3.4, are consistent with this request. The radiative decay of Y(4260) to the X(3872) was even predicted within the latter model as a necessary consequence of the observation of the reaction Y(4260) \u2192 \u03c0Z c (3900), if all the three mentioned states are hadronic molecules [70]. Recently BESIII updated the analysis of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 using an about 9 fb \u22121 data sample at c.m. energies above 4 GeV [71]. Clear X(3872) signals are observed with a signal significance of 16.1\u03c3, which confirms the previous observation [65]. Besides the discovered channel, Belle also observed clear X(3872) signals in B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 X(3872) and B + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + X(3872) using 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB events [72], where the fraction of the K * (892) 0 signal component in the K + \u03c0 \u2212 system is 34%.",

The background-subtracted pK \u2212 mass spectrum for the X(3872) channel is shown in Fig. 13 (right panel), where a clear peak associated with the \u039b(1520) state is seen. An unbinned maximum-likelihood fit with a \u039b(1520) signal and a nonresonant component was performed. The fraction of the \u039b(1520) is (58 \u00b1 15)%, where the uncertainty is statistical only. The fitted results are shown in Fig. 13 (right panel) with fitted components indicated. Using the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S )pK \u2212 decay as a normalization channel, the ratio of the branching fractions is measured to be",

A search for exotic charmonium-like states in exclusive photoproduction reactions was proposed in Refs. [76][77][78]. Recently COMPASS, a fixed-target experiment at CERN, analyzed the full set of data collected with a muon beam between 2002 and 2011, covering the range from 7 to 19 GeV in the c.m. energy of the virtual photon-nucleon Figure 13: The J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and background-subtracted pK \u2212 mass spectra within the X(3872) signal region from \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pK \u2212 decay, together with fitted results described in the text [75]. system, to search for the X(3872) in photoproduction reactions. The X(3872) was searched for in the charge-exchange reaction \u00b5 + N \u2192 \u00b5 + J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00b1 N , where N denotes the target nucleon and N the unobserved recoil system. The resulting \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 14 (left plot), where two peaks with positions and widths consistent with the \u03c8(2S ) and X(3872) are evident. The significance of the second peak is 4.1\u03c3 with systematic effects included. However, the shape of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution corresponding to the second peak shows disagreement with previous observations for X(3872) and is inconsistent with quantum numbers J PC = 1 ++ , as shown in Fig. 14 (right plot) where the squares with error bars are from the COMPASS measurement and the dots with error bars from the ATLAS data set [61] for comparison. Due to this critical difference, the COMPASS Collaboration concluded that the observed signal is not the well-known X(3872) giving possible evidence for a new charmonium-like state denoted X(3872). The measured mass and width of theX(3872) are M[X(3872)] = (3860.0 \u00b1 10.4) MeV and \u0393[X(3872)] < 51 MeV at 90% C.L., and the product of the cross section and branching fraction of theX(3872) into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 is determined to be (71 \u00b1 28 \u00b1 39) pb. An independent confirmation of the observedX(3872) signal from high-precision experiments with high-energy virtual or real photons is required.

So the decay mode X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 is well established, while for X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S ), the results from some measurements are not consistent. Evidence for it was first reported by BaBar with a statistical significance of 3.5\u03c3 using (465 \u00b1 5) \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs [80]. The ratio of the branching fractions is measured to be R = B[X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S )]/B[X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8] = 3.4 \u00b1 1.4, where statistical and systematic uncertainties are combined.

The measured value of the ratio R is 2.46 \u00b1 0.64 \u00b1 0.29, which is in good agreement with the BaBar's measurement [80]. In contrast, the negative result was reported by Belle using 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs and an upper limit of R < 2.1 was set at the 90% C.L. [81]. Using the information from Ref.

            "text": "A measurement of pionic transitions of the X(3872) to the \u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) has been proposed to be one way to distinguish between various interpretations. If the X(3872) is a conventional cc state, transition to the \u03c0 0 \u03c7 c1 should be suppressed compared to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c7 c1 due to isospin breaking by the light quark masses. If the X(3872) is a compact tetraquark or molecular state, on the other hand, these rates are expected to be enhanced [86][87][88]. In the search for X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c7 c1 with negative results, the Belle Collaboration determined the branching fraction [89]. Recently BESIII reported the first observation of the decay X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c7 c1 in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) with a statistical significance of 5.2\u03c3 using data at the c.m. energies above 4 GeV corresponding an integrated luminosity of 9 fb \u22121 [71]. To calculate the ratio (19), 0.88 +0.33 \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.10, 0.40 +0.37 \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.04(1.1) , for J = 0, 1, and 2, respectively, where the numbers in brackets are 90% C.L. upper limits. The normalization channel was e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) with X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 updated at the same time. In the BESIII measurement, after initial event selection, a clear signal for the X(3872) can be seen in the data of 4.15 to 4.30 GeV, while no evidence for the X(3872) is seen at other c.m. energy points. A fit to the invariant mass distribution of \u03c0 0 \u03c7 cJ with a first-order polynomial background and a signal shape from the signal MC simulation directly yields 16.9 +5.2 \u22124.5 X(3872) events with a statistical significance of 4.8\u03c3. After requiring the \u03b3J/\u03c8 mass within the \u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) mass region respectively, the resulting distributions for M(\u03c0 0 \u03c7 cJ ) with J = 0, 1, 2 are shown in Fig. 15. The fits to each M(\u03c0 0 \u03c7 cJ ) distribution with a constant background and a signal shape from MC simulation give 1.9 +1.9 \u22121.3 , 10.8 +3.8 \u22123.1 , and 2.5 +2.3 \u22121.7 X(3872) signal events with signal significances of 1.6\u03c3, 5.2\u03c3, and 1.6\u03c3 for J = 0, 1, and 2, respectively. No significant X(3872) signal is found in the M(\u03c0 0 \u03c7 c0,c2 ) distributions. This is the first observation of a decay of the X(3872) to a P-wave charmonium state and it supports the non-cc interpretations of the X(3872) [86][87][88]. This BESIII observation can be cross-checked by other experiments like Belle. Previously, Belle measured B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 \u03c7 c1 and provided the background-subtracted \u03c0 0 \u03c7 c1 mass distribution without any structure at the X(3872) mass [89], but the bin width of that mass spectrum is too large to claim a contradictory result. Considering this, very recently Belle updated the analysis of B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 0 K + decays to focus on the X(3872) mass region [90] using 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB events.",

Recently the X(3872) \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8 decay was firmly observed with a more than 5\u03c3 significance by the BESIII Collaboration in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9J/\u03c8 with a total integrated luminosity of about 11.6 fb \u22121 at c.m. energies from \u221a s =4.008 to 4.600 GeV [74]. The \u03c9J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution from the BESIII measurement is shown in Fig. 16 as the dots with error bars, where a signal peak consistent with the X(3872) resonance is observed together with a broad structure from irreducible e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 background events. In addition, there are evident structures above 3.9 GeV. Two fit scenarios were adopted for an approximation of the \u03c9J/\u03c8 mass spectrum: (1) the incoherent sum of three BW resonances (denoted as X(3872), X(3915), and X(3960), respectively); (2) the incoherent sum of the X(3872) and X(3915). The corresponding fit results are shown in Fig. 16 with red solid lines. In both fits, the signal significance of the X(3872) is larger than 5\u03c3 and the X(3872) mass was measured to be (3873.3 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 1.0) MeV. The low statistics of the BESIII experiment prevent us from drawing a solid conclusion about the states above 3.9 GeV.

Figure 17 (left plot) shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S ) invariant mass distribution in CMS data [118]. Except the clear \u03a5(2S ) signal, no evidence for an X b signal was observed. However, unlike the X(3872), whose decays exhibit large isospin violation, the X b should decay preferably into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03a5(1S ) rather than \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S ) if it exists [110,111,113]. So Belle performed a search for an X b signal decaying to \u03c9\u03a5(1S ) in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X b at a c.m. energy of 10.867 GeV using a 118 fb \u22121 data sample [119]. Figure 17 (right plot) shows the \u03c9\u03a5(1S ) invariant mass distribution in a range from 10.55 to 10.65 GeV. The dots with error bars are from data, the solid histogram is from the normalized contribution of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 bJ (J = 0, 1, 2). No obvious X b signal is observed, and 90% C.L. upper limits on the product branching fraction B[\u03a5(5S ) \u2192 \u03b3X b ]B[X b \u2192 \u03c9\u03a5(1S )] vary smoothly from 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 between 10.55 and 10.65 GeV. We also note that the absence of the X b state in ATLAS, CMS, and Belle experiments may be understood in a few theoretical models. For example, in Ref. [120] the X b is regarded as a virtual state about 10 MeV below the BB * threshold, which means that it has no significant observable effects.",

However, in 2010 BaBar restudied the decays B 0,+ \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 K 0,+ using 467\u00d710 6 BB pairs [91]. Considering the phase space limitation, with a less restrictive \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass region requirement a detailed study on the \u03c9J/\u03c8 mass spectrum revealed that the original Y(3940) was made up of two structures, the  X(3915) and X(3872). As mentioned above, due to the assignment of J PC = 0 ++ for the X(3915), it was identified as the \u03c7 c0 (2P) in the 2014 PDG tables. However, this assignment has some problems [126,127]. Moreover, in Ref. [128] it was shown that the data for the X(3915) could even be consistent with the \u03c7 c2 (3930), if the helicity-1-dominance constraint is relaxed in the analysis. As a result of these considerations, the X(3915) is no longer identified as the \u03c7 c0 (2P) in the more recent PDG tables.",

Recently, Belle performed a full amplitude analysis of the process J/\u03c8DD (D=D 0 or D + ) based on a 980 fb \u22121 data sample [134]. A new charmonium-like state X(3860) that decays to DD is observed with a significance of 6.5\u03c3. Its mass is (3862 +26+40 \u221232\u221213 ) MeV and width is (201 +154+88 \u221267\u221282 ) MeV. The J PC = 0 ++ hypothesis is favored over the 2 ++ hypothesis at the level of 2.5\u03c3 and the new state is now called \u03c7 c0 (3860) by the PDG. Its mass is close to the potential model expectations for the \u03c7 c0 (2P), so it is a better candidate for the \u03c7 c0 (2P) charmonium state than the X(3915). Figure 19 shows the projection of the signal fit results onto the M(DD) distribution. The points with error bars are the data, the hatched histogram is the background, the blue solid line is the fit with the new resonance with J PC = 0 ++ , and the red dashed line is the fit with a nonresonant amplitude only. 18 Figure 19: Projection of the signal fit results onto M(DD) in the analysis of e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8DD by Belle [134].

This analysis offers the best sensitivity to study the resonant structures in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system. The data requires not only two J PC = 1 ++ states, the \u03c7 c1 (4140) aka X(4140) and \u03c7 c1 (4274) aka X(4274) observed by CDF and CMS before, but also two new broad J PC = 0 ++ states, X(4500) and X(4700). Figure 20 shows the \u03c6J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution for the selected signal candidates, where four \u03c6J/\u03c8 structures, X(4140), X(4274), X(4500), and X(4700), are needed [39]. These resonance parameters including signal significance, J PC values, and the measured mass and width are listed in Table 3.",

After that, a few Y states were discovered at B factories using ISR technology. The idea of utilizing ISR from a high-mass state to explore electron-positron processes at all energies below that state was outlined in Ref. [152]. With ISR events the whole hadron spectrum is visible so that the line shape of the resonance and fine structures can be investigated, while the effective luminosity and detection efficiency are relatively low. To study the Y states, a method complementary to the ISR is to take data via direct e + e \u2212 annihilation in the charmonium energy region. In particular, BESIII has collected large data samples above 4 GeV in recent years [20], which allow accurate determinations of the cross sections for some final states. The drawback is that since the data are taken at fixed energy points, one might miss narrow structures.",

Subsequently, although the Y(4260) was confirmed by Belle in the same process, Belle found that Y(4260) alone cannot describe the line shape satisfactorily [25].

            "text": "BESIII reported a precise measurement of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross sections from 3.77 to 4.60 GeV using data samples with an integrated luminosity of 9 fb \u22121 [73]. While the nature of the events at around 4 GeV is still ambiguous, the dominant resonant structure, the so called Y(4260), was found to have a mass of (4222.0 \u00b1 3.1 \u00b1 1.4) MeV and a width of (44.1 \u00b1 4.3 \u00b1 2.0) MeV. In addition, a new resonance with a mass of around 4.32 GeV is needed to describe the high precision data. Its mass and width are (4320.0\u00b110.4\u00b17.0) MeV and (101.4 +25.3 \u221219.7 \u00b110.2) MeV with a statistical significance larger than 7.6\u03c3. This resonance is called Y(4320). However, it should be mentioned that the analysis mentioned above was performed using BW functions that generate symmetric line shapes -however, already the analysis of the older data based on the molecular picture, which naturally generates asymmetric line shapes even from a single state only, found a mass for the Y(4260) close to 4230 MeV [154] that is also qualitatively consistent with the new data as discussed in Sec. 4.3.4 (see Fig. 81). Figure 22(a) shows the measured e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross sections, where one can see clearly the Y(4260) structure observed by BaBar and Belle experiments, but its peaking position is at around 4.22 GeV rather than 4.26 GeV from the previous fits [68,153]. Since both mass and width of Y(4320) are consistent with those of the Y(4360) resonance observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ) by BaBar and Belle [155,156], they could be the same state, which needs to be confirmed with precise measurements of these two resonant parameters in the future. It is worth pointing out that the lower mass structure [called \u03c8(4230) aka Y(4230) hereafter] is the main component of the Y(4260) structure with an improved measurement of the resonant parameters. But we also note that an accurate measurement of the cross section at 4.32 GeV is very important since its size will determine how to describe the line shape of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross sections, in particular if there is one or two resonances.",

            "text": "A possible strong coupling of the Y(4230) to the \u03c9\u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) final state was proposed by a few authors [161,162]. In 2014, BESIII reported the cross section measurement of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 at 9 c.m. energies from 4.21 to 4.42 GeV, where \u03c7 c0 candidates are reconstructed via a pair of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or K + K \u2212 [160]. The Born cross sections are measured to be (55.4 \u00b1 6.0 \u00b1 5.9) pb and (23.7 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b1 3.5) pb at \u221a s = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV, respectively, which are comparable to those of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 process [73]. Later BESIII updated the measurement of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 with higher energy data up to 4.6 GeV included [163]. Besides the energy points at 4.23 and 4.26 GeV, no significant signals are found at other energy points, and the upper limits on the cross sections at the 90% C.L. are determined [163]. The cross sections are shown in Fig. 24 (left plot), where a clear peaking structure close to the threshold is observed although there are only two statistically significant measurements available. Assuming the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 signals come from a single resonance, the cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 are fitted with a BW function as shown in Fig. 24 (left plot). The fitted mass and width are (4226 \u00b1 8 \u00b1 6) MeV and (39 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 2) MeV, respectively, with a statistical significance of more than 9\u03c3. Very recently the cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 was again updated by BESIII at c.m. energies \u221a s from 4.178 to 4.278 GeV using a data sample of 7 fb \u22121 [164]. The event selection is almost the same as before [160,163]. The updated e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 cross section as a function of the c.m. energy is shown in Fig. 25, where the blue points are from the updated measurement [164] and the black square points are from previous measurements [160,163]. As expected, the Y(4230) signal is observed clearly. By assuming that all the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 signals come from this resonance, the fit result is shown in Fig. 25 with a solid red line and the fitted mass and width are M = (4218.5 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b1 4.0) MeV and \u0393 = (28.2 \u00b1 3.9 \u00b1 1.6) MeV. The updated measurement confirms and statistically improves upon the previous observation [160,163]. The parameters of this state are consistent with those of the narrow structure in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159,161] [165], and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ) [166] (discussed below) processes.",

Therefore, whether or not this state can couple to open charm channels is a crucial issue for understanding its nature. Utilizing the measured cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * D * and D * sD * s by Belle [167,168], the authors of Ref. [169] performed fits using \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415) together with the Y(4230) allowing for an interference between them [169]. The cross sections can be well described by these states, and the interference between the Y(4230) and the other charmonia produces a dip around 4.22 GeV in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * D * cross section line shape. However, the errors of current Belle measurements are large especially for e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * sD * s cross sections. More precise measurements should be done at BESIII to clarify the role played by the Y(4230).",

            "text": "Recently BESIII reported an improved measurement of the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. at c.m. energies from 4.05 to 4.60 GeV at 15 energy points with integrated luminosity larger than 40 pb \u22121 for each point and 69 \"R-scan data\" points with integrated luminosity smaller than 20 pb \u22121 for each point [165], where the D 0 meson is reconstructed via D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and the bachelor \u03c0 + is also reconstructed, while the D * \u2212 is inferred from energymomentum conservation in order to increase the statistics. The measured cross sections are shown in Fig. 26(b). Two resonant structures in good agreement with the Y(4230) and Y(4390) observed in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159] are identified over a smoothly increasing non-resonant term which can be parametrized with a three-body phase-space amplitude. Therefore, a fit to the cross section from BESIII measurement is performed to determine the parameters of the two resonant structures.  [170] and (b) BESIII [165] experiments. Belle did a fit to cross sections with a \u03c8(4415) signal plus a threshold function, while BESIII did a fit with the coherent sum of a direct three-body phase-space term and two BW functions for the Y(4230) and Y(4390). The solid lines are the total fit results. The total amplitude is described by the coherent sum of a direct three-body phase-space term for e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. and two BW functions, representing the two resonant structures. The fit yields a mass of (4228.6 \u00b1 4.1 \u00b1 6.3) MeV and a width of (77.0 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b1 6.3) MeV for the lower mass structure. As for the higher mass structure, there are complicated effects which require further detailed amplitude analysis since a few excited \u03c8 states and Y charmonium-like states may overlap in this wide mass region. Models including one additional known resonance, either Y(4320), Y(4360), or \u03c8(4415) with their masses and widths fixed to the world average values [6], can improve the fit quality. However, the statistical significance of any additional resonance is less than 2\u03c3. Since the lower mass resonance is in good agreement with the Y(4230) observed in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c , and \u03c9\u03c7 c0 modes [73,159], this indicates the first observation of the Y(4230) decays into an open-charm final state D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c.. The measured Born cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. at the Y(4230) peak is higher than the sum of the known hidden-charm channels, which tells us the D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. final state may be the dominant decay mode of the Y(4230) state.",

As current measurements only give the product of the leptonic decay width and the strong decay widths, the magnitude of the leptonic decay width determines how the strong decay widths sum up to the total width. Smaller leptonic decay width means that the strong decay widths will be relatively enhanced and vice versa. The estimate of quenched 3 lattice QCD for the leptonic decay width of the Y(4230) is about 40 eV [172] assuming it to be a hybrid meson and neglecting its coupling to meson-meson decay channels; the predicted upper limit of the Y(4230) leptonic decay width is about 500 eV if the Y(4230) is a hadronic molecule dominated by DD 1 (2420) [173]; the leptonic decay width is only about 23 eV for the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 molecule interpretation [162], where no contributions from the open charm decay channel are included in the analysis.",

Figure 27 shows the measured mass and width of the Y(4230) from the processes \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [73], e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159], D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. [165], \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ) [166], and \u03c9\u03c7 c0 [164] from the BESIII Collaboration. Although the measured masses are consistent with each other, the widths from the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ), and D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. are larger than those from the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and \u03c9\u03c7 c0 . At the moment, we cannot draw a conclusion on whether the structure observed in these processes is the same state or whether the inconsistencies are caused by the BW parametrization. Further experimental studies with higher statistics are needed to draw a more reliable conclusion on the nature of this structure. The compact tetraquark model [174] predicted a sizeable isospin-violating process Y(4230) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 with Z 0 c decaying into \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and possibly \u03b7J/\u03c8. The molecular model [175] predicted a peak in the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 at the D 1D threshold and a narrow peak in the \u03b7J/\u03c8 mass spectrum at the DD * threshold.  [176]. No Y(4230) signal is observed, and upper limits on the cross sections e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 at the 90% C.L. are determined to be 3.6, 1.7, 2.4, 1.4, 0.9, and 1.9 pb for \u221a s =4.009, 4.226, 4.257, 4.358, 4.416, and 4.599 GeV, respectively. Under the assumption of Y(4230) being a hybrid meson, the quenched lattice study [177] suggested that the rate of decay to \u03b3\u03b7 c may be enhanced relative to \u03b3\u03c7 c0 . Finding evidence for Y(4230) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c could thus give additional support to the hybrid interpretation. BESIII searched for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c at six c.m. energies between 4.01 and 4.60 GeV corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 [178]. The final distribution of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) is shown as the points in Fig. 28. The lines in Fig. 28 show the different assumptions of resulting cross sections as a function of energy, where (1) \u03c3 FLAT : the cross section is constant, (2) \u03c3 BELLE : the cross section follows the Belle parametrization of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) [68], (3) \u03c3 Y(4230) : the cross section follows a non-relativistic BW distribution for the Y(4260) with mass and width values from the PDG [6], and (4) \u03c3 Y(4360) : the cross section follows a nonrelativistic BW distribution for the Y(4360) with mass and width values from the PDG [6]. With current statistics, Figure 27: The measured mass and width of the Y(4230) from the processes \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [73], e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159], D 0 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + + c.c. [165], \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ) [166], and \u03c9\u03c7 c0 [164] from the BESIII Collaboration. different assumptions for the energy dependence of the cross section can not be distinguished, but the cross section is somewhat better explained by \u03c3 Y(4230) . The expected rates of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(4040)/\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c are also shown in Fig. 28 as solid lines. Both significances are 1.9\u03c3. Much larger data samples are required to confirm the existence of the Y(4230) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c process. Some light-hadron final states are also searched for by BESIII for the Y(4230) decays including [180]. The Born cross sections of e + e \u2212 to these final states are measured up to 4.6 GeV. In fitting these cross sections, besides the continuum component, a Y(4230) signal is added. No clear signal is observed, thus the 90% C.L. upper limits on the cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 Y(4230) times the branching fractions of the Y(4230) to these final states are set.",

If Y(4230) is a DD 1 (2420) molecule, the binding energy is about 66 MeV which is rather large but not excluded. If Y(4230) is a cc-gluon hybrid, its mass is about 180 MeV below current predictions from lattice QCD [131], but consistent with the mass determined from combining non-relativistic EFTs and lattice QCD data of the hybrid static energies [192,193] (see also Sec. 4.4.4), all of which neglect the resonant nature of the Y(4230). If it were a compact tetraquark state, it would have isospin-and SU(3)-multiplet partner states. However, none of them has been observed in experiments so far. If it is a hadrocharmonium, its decay rate to non-J/\u03c8(h c ) charmonium states should be suppressed, which is not supported by the data although a possible mixing of two hadrocharmonia with spin 1 and spin 0 compactcc cores can make the scenario consistent [191]. At this point in time the nature of this lightest negative parity exotic candidate is not yet fully settled.",

            "text": "There have been a number of different interpretations proposed for the Y(4320) and Y(4390), including a \u03c8(3 3 D 1 ) state [194,195], a compact tetraquark state [196,197], a hadrocharmonium [198], a D * D 1 (2420) molecule [199][200][201], a state formed from dynamical diquarks [202], a hybrid state [193] and so on. In addition to the above explanations, a special explanation is that the Y(4320) and Y(4390) may not exist at all. The authors of Ref. [203] found that the fits to the distributions of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c cross sections measured by BESIII with three interfering resonances Y(4230), \u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415) can also describe the data well with a goodness of the fit of \u03c7 2 /nd f = 118/153 and 18/69, respectively, where nd f is the number of degrees of freedom. Based on the fit qualities, the authors argued that two newly reported charmonium-like states, Y(4320) and Y(4390), are not genuine resonances. However, it should be stressed that the analysis of Ref. [203] needs to implement a huge amount of spin-symmetry violation as well as very large non-resonant couplings at odds with our current understanding of the role of the heavy quark spin symmetry in doubly-heavy systems (see also Sec. 4.4).",

A fit to the signal events with two coherent P-wave BWs for \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) and an incoherent second-order polynomial background can describe the data well. The statistical significance is 6.5\u03c3 for \u03c8(4040) and 7.6\u03c3 for \u03c8(4160). The branching fractions of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 are obtained to be (0.56 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.17)% and (1.30 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.24)%, respectively, which correspond to about 1 MeV partial widths to \u03b7J/\u03c8 for these two states. Possible contributions from other excited charmonium-like states are examined, including the Y(4230), Y(4360), and Y(4660). None of their significance is larger than 3\u03c3, and 90% C.L. upper limits of their production rates in e + e \u2212 annihilation are determined. The measured Born cross sections are shown in the left panel of Fig. 35.",

            "text": "After the observation of strong \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) decays into \u03b7J/\u03c8, it is natural to perform the measurement of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 J/\u03c8 process. BESIII did such a measurement to search for potential \u03b7 J/\u03c8 transitions from charmonium and charmonium-like states using data samples of about 4.5 fb \u22121 in total at c.m. energies from 4.189 to 4.600 GeV [220], where the \u03b7 is reconstructed in two decay channels, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Figure 36 shows the measured Born cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 J/\u03c8. Two alternative fits are taken to fit the cross section distribution: one is the fit with a \u03c8(4160) resonance with the BW parameters fixed to PDG values [6], and the other is the fit with an additional \u03c8(4415) resonance. The fitted results are shown in Fig. 36 as the red and green curves. The statistical significance of \u03c8(4415) is 2.6\u03c3 only. No interesting charmonium-like states are observed with current statistics. Figure 36: The measured Born cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 J/\u03c8 by BESIII [220]. The red curve is the fit with a \u03c8(4160) resonance, and the green curve is the fit with an additional \u03c8(4415) resonance. Some Y states are observed decaying into spin-triplet charmonium states with a large rate since the spin alignment of the c andc-quarks does not need to be changed between initial and final states. However, the cross section for the spin-flip process may not be small, for example the Y(4230) and Y(4390) are reported by BESIII in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159]. This suggests a more complicated structure of the states containing both heavy-quark spin-0 and 1 components or a milder heavy-quark spin suppression mechanism as discussed in the theory sections below. Consequently, searching for the reaction of e + e \u2212 to final states with an h c or \u03b7 c is very important.",

A significant \u03c9\u03c7 c2 signal is found at \u221a s =4.42 GeV with an integrated luminosity of 1074 pb \u22121 , and the cross section is measured to be (20.9 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b1 2.5) pb. With 567 pb \u22121 data near \u221a s = 4.6 GeV, a clear \u03c9\u03c7 c1 signal is seen, and the cross section is measured to be (9.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 1.3) pb. Due to low luminosity or low cross section at other energies, no significant signals are observed. A coherent sum of the \u03c8(4415) BW function and a phase-space term can well describe the \u03c9\u03c7 c2 line shape, and the branching fraction \u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c2 is found to be of the order of 10 \u22123 . The solid line in Fig. 24 (right plot) shows the fit result. Further studies based on more data samples at higher energy points will be helpful to clarify the nature of charmonium(like) states decaying to \u03c9\u03c7 cJ final states.",

            "text": "The D0 Collaboration reported evidence for a narrow structure, X(5568), in the hadronic decay X(5568) \u2192 B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 with B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 with a signal significance greater than 3.9\u03c3 in proton-antiproton collisions at a c.m. energy of 1.96 TeV [34]. The measured mass and width are M = (5567.8 \u00b1 2.9 +0.9 \u22121.9 ) MeV and \u0393 = (21.9 \u00b1 6.4 +5.0 \u22122.5 ) MeV. Since the state can be interpreted as a compact tetraquark with four different valence quark flavors, b, s, u, d, it has received extensive attention from theoretical and experimental physicists. Later the X(5568) signal was confirmed by the D0 Collaboration in the semileptonic decay of B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 \u2213 D \u00b1 s X with a statistical significance greater than 4.3\u03c3 [227]. Figure 39 shows the M(B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 ) distributions for the hadronic (red squares) and semileptonic (black circles) data (a) with and (b) without the cone requirement \u2206R = \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c6 2 < 0.3, where the cone is the angle between the B 0 s and \u03c0 \u00b1 for hadronic decay, the angle between the \u00b5 \u2213 D \u00b1 s system and \u03c0 \u00b1 for semileptonic decay, \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)] is the pseudorapidity (\u03b8 is the polar angle between the track momentum and the proton beam direction), and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the track. A combined fit is performed to the selected hadronic and semileptonic signal candidates, and the fitted results are shown in Fig. 39 as solid lines. The fitted mass and width are M = (5566.9 +3.2+0. 6 \u22123.1\u22121.2 ) MeV and \u0393 = (18.6 +7.9+3. 5 \u22126.1\u22123.8 ) MeV. The signal significance with the systematic uncertainties included is 6.7 \u03c3 with the cone requirement, and 4.7 \u03c3 without it. While the D0 Collaboration reported the X(5568) in both hadronic and semileptonic decays, negative results were obtained in the LHCb [228], CDF [229], CMS [230], and ATLAS [231] experiments. LHCb first provided negative results using a 3 fb \u22121 data sample of pp collision data at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [228], where the B 0 s mesons are reconstructed through the decays B 0 s \u2192 D \u00b1 s \u03c0 \u2213 and J/\u03c8\u03c6. The reconstructed B 0 s yield is approximately 20 times larger than that used by D0. No significant signal is seen in the B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 invariant mass distribution in the range of about 5.5 GeV to 6 GeV, and upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X + anything)B(X \u2192 B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 ) are set as a function of the mass and width of a possible exotic meson decaying to the B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 final state. Recently, CDF, CMS, and ATLAS also searched for the X(5568) in hadronic decays using data samples of 9.  [229][230][231]. Figure 40 shows the reconstructed M(B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 ) distributions from the CDF [229] (left plot), CMS [230] (middle plot), and ATLAS [231] (right plot) measurements for B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 candidates with p T (B 0 s ) > 10 GeV, respectively. No statistically significant peaks can be seen in either of them. Upper limits of 6.7% from CDF, 1.1% from CMS, and 1.5% from ATLAS on the fraction of B 0 s produced through the X(5568) \u2192 B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 process at the 95% C.L. are set for p T (B 0 s ) > 10 GeV, respectively. The X(5568) state, if confirmed, would differ from any previously observed state, as it must have constituent quarks with four different flavors (b, s, u, d). So far, however, only the D0 experiment observed signals, while other experiments with larger statistics reported negative results, especially the CDF experiment from the same protonantiproton collisions. Therefore, the urgent task in the future is to confirm or definitely exclude the existence of the X(5568) with larger data samples and to look for possible similar exotic states in the B * s \u03c0, D s \u03c0, and D * s \u03c0 systems. From the theoretical side, many explanations on the X(5568) being a compact tetraquark state [232][233][234][235][236][237][238][239][240][241][242][243] or a meson molecule [244,245] have been proposed. At the same time, there have also been theoretical analyses that do not support the interpretation as a compact tetraquark state [246], as a molecular state [247][248][249][250][251], or as any of the two [252,253]. In Ref. [254] all the possible interpretations, such as compact tetraquark, hadronic molecule, threshold effect from the meson loop, and so on, have been found unable to provide a consistent explanation of the X(5568). Finally, due to the inconsistency of the interpretations in both the compact tetraquark and hadronic molecular scenarios, the authors of Refs. [255][256][257] have suggested that the state might originate from a mixing of these two scenarios.",

A fit with a relativistic S -wave BW function to model the peak plus a smooth phase-space-like function yields a mass M = (4433 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 2) MeV and a width \u0393 = (45 +18+30 \u221213\u221213 ) MeV with a signal significance of 6.5\u03c3.

In the amplitude fit, all known K * resonances, a nonresonant term, and a Z \u2212 c amplitude represented by a BW function are included. The fit yields a mass of (4475 \u00b1 7 +15 \u221225 ) MeV and a width of (172 \u00b1 13 +37 \u221234 ) MeV, which are consistent with, but more precise than, the Belle results [259]. The lowest significance for the Z c (4430) \u2212 signal is 13.9\u03c3. It means the data cannot be described with K + \u03c0 \u2212 resonances alone, thus confirming the existence of the Z c (4430) \u2212 . The projection of the 4D amplitude fit on the M \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S ) is shown in Fig. 42, where the red solid (brown dashed) histogram represents the total amplitude with (without) the Z \u2212 c component, the upper (lower) blue points represent the Z \u2212 c component removed (taken alone), and the orange, magenta, cyan, yellow, green, and red points represent the K * (892), total S -wave, K * (1410), K * (1680), K * 2 (1430), and background terms, respectively. Relative to J P = 1 + , the 0 \u2212 , 1 \u2212 , 2 + , and 2 \u2212 hypotheses are ruled out by at least 9.7\u03c3, thus the spin-parity of the Z c (4430) is established to be 1 + unambiguously. In addition, LHCb measures the Argand plot of the Z \u2212 c amplitude as a function of M \u03c0\u03c8(2S ) , which is consistent with a rapid change of the Z c (4430) \u2212 phase when its magnitude reaches the maximum, expected behavior of a resonance.

This selected data sample is divided into 35 fine bins in M(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and a four-dimensional angular analysis is performed in each mass bin. The four variables, M(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ), \u03b8 V , \u03b8 l , and \u03c7, fully describe the decay topology, where \u03b8 V is the K + helicity angle defined as the K + momentum direction in the K + \u03c0 \u2212 helicity frame with respect to the B 0 rest frame, \u03b8 l is the similar lepton helicity angle, and \u03c7 is the the azimuthal angle between the (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and (K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decay planes.

Figure 45 shows the comparison of the M(J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 ) distributions between the background-subtracted data and weighted simulated events with the J k max = 2 model taken in the M(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2208 [1085, 1265] MeV region. The J k max = 2 model clearly can not describe the peaking structures in the data around M(J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2248 4200 and 4600 MeV, which strongly indicates presence of exotic components. The significance for exotic components is in excess of 6\u03c3 with systematic uncertainties included. The structure at M(J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2248 4200 MeV is close to the exotic state reported by Belle [261]. To interpret these structures as exotic tetraquark resonances and measure their properties will require a future model-dependent amplitude analysis of the data. \u2022 The Z c (3900) and Z c (4020) states",

There is also an indication that some Z c (3900) \u00b1 signal events come from b-hadron decays to an intermediate J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 combination with mass above that of the Y(4360). This is the first evidence for the Z c (3900) production at a hadron collider.",

In this analysis, a partial reconstruction technique is used, i.e., taking \u03c0 \u2212 D * +D * 0 as an example, only the bachelor \u03c0 \u2212 , a charged D + , and at least one soft \u03c0 0 from D * decays are reconstructed. By identifying the D + particle, the charges of its mother particle D * + and the bachelor \u03c0 \u2212 are also unambiguously identified. The Z c (4020) state is searched for in the bachelor \u03c0 \u00b1 recoil mass spectrum. The final \u03c0 \u00b1 recoil mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 56 (left), where a structure near the (D * D * ) \u00b1 threshold is observed and the shaded histogram is from the combinatorial backgrounds estimated by combining a reconstructed D \u00b1 with a pion of the wrong charge. Since the signal events from phase space (dot-dashed line) and combinatorial backgrounds (dotted line) cannot describe the data, assuming the enhancement is due to Z c (4020), an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the \u03c0 \u00b1 recoil mass spectrum is performed with an S -wave BW shape to parameterize the structure. The fit yields a mass of (4026.3 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b1 3.7) MeV and a width of (24.8 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b1 7.7) MeV, with a statistical significance of 13\u03c3. The fit results are shown in Fig. 56 (left).

In the PWA, BESIII also searched for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 Z c (4020) + + c.c. \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, with the Z c (4020) \u00b1 assumed to be a 1 + state added in the global fit. Its mass is taken from Ref. [158] and width is taken as the observed value. The fit yields a 3\u03c3 statistical significance for Z c (4020) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 in the combined data. The Born cross sections are measured to be (0.2 \u00b1 0.1) pb at \u221a s = 4.23 GeV and (0.8 \u00b1 0.4) pb at \u221a s = 4.26 GeV, and the corresponding upper limits at the 90% C.L. are estimated to be 0.9 and 1.4 pb, respectively. Although the observations of the Z c (3900) and Z c (4020) indicate that they are not conventional mesons consisting of a quark-antiquark pair, their exact quark configuration is still unknown. There are many models developed to interpret their inner structure, including loosely bound hadronic molecules of two charmed mesons, compact tetraquarks, hadroquarkonium, and so on. Therefore, how to discriminate between the molecule and compact tetraquark scenarios experimentally is an important research topic that will be discussed in some depth in various subsections of Sec. 4. It has recently been suggested that the relative decay rate of Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c to \u03c0J/\u03c8 [or Z c (4020) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c to \u03c0h c ] can be used to discriminate them [277]. In the compact tetraquark scenario, the predicted ratio of B[Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c ]/B[Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c0J/\u03c8] is 230 or 0.27, depending on whether or not the spin-spin interaction outside the diquarks is kept [277][278][279][280][281][282]. In the molecular framework, on the other hand, this ratio is only 0.046. Similarly, the predicted ratio of B[Z c (4020) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c ]/B[Z c (4020) \u2192 \u03c0J/\u03c8] is 6.6 in the compact tetraquark model, but only 0.01 in the meson molecule model [277]. Therefore, a search for the decays Z c (3900)/Z c (4020) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c offers an important opportunity to understand the internal structure of the Z c (3900) and Z c (4020).",

It is an isovector state with positive G-parity and spin-parity J P = 1 + . It decays into \u03c0J/\u03c8 and DD * , and it may also decay into \u03c1\u03b7 c and \u03c0h c final states. The neutral Z c (3900) has a negative C-parity. Although the reported masses and widths are consistent with each other in many measurements, in most of the cases the possible interference between the Z c (3900) and other amplitudes is neglected. A PWA to the selected e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 events has been done by BESIII [269], giving a pole mass of (3881.2 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b1 52.7) MeV and a width of (51.8 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b1 36.0) MeV, where the large errors are dominated by the uncertainties in the parametrization of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S -wave amplitudes. In this PWA, a drawback is the assumption of Z c (3900) decaying dominantly into \u03c0J/\u03c8 and DD * modes, which may introduce bias, as the \u03c1\u03b7 c mode has been observed with a larger decay rate than \u03c0J/\u03c8. There could be other decay modes such as \u03c0h c , \u03c0\u03c8(2S ) and so on. This needs to be checked with larger data samples in the future. The reported production cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + Z c (3900) \u2212 + c.c. suffers from the same problems mentioned above. The only reliable measurement is the product cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + Z c (3900) \u2212 + c.c. \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 determined from PWA which is (21.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 4.4) pb at \u221a s = 4.23 GeV and (11.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 5.4) pb at \u221a s = 4.26 GeV [269]. The former at 4.23 GeV is twice as big as the latter at 4.26 GeV. It would be very important to measure the Z c (3900) production cross sections at other c.m. energies, to check if the line shape of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0Z c (3900) is the same as that of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8.

The spin-parity quantum numbers of the Z c (4020) are not measured yet, but J P = 1 + are assumed in all the analyses. The currently observed decay modes are \u03c0h c and D * D * . With current statistics at BESIII, the possible decay modes of \u03c0J/\u03c8 and \u03c1\u03b7 c have not been observed yet. The neutral Z c (4020) has a negative C-parity. The reported masses and widths in both analyses of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c and D * D * final states may have bias, since the reported values depend on different assumptions on the signal shape and the possible interference between the Z c (4020) and other amplitudes is neglected. In the analyses of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0D * D * [275,276], the Z c (4020) \u00b1 and Z c (4020) 0 are parameterized with different line shapes and the pole mass and width are reported in the latter case. In addition, the fractions of non-Z c (4020) events in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0D * D * are quite different in charged and neutral modes. All these suggest that improved measurements of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0D * D * , both charged and neutral modes, using more D-tag modes and data at other c.m. energies are necessary. The most reliable measurement is probably from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c mode [158] due to the very narrow width. The mass and width are measured to be (4022.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 2.7) MeV and (7.9 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b1 2.6) MeV, respectively, in this mode. Of course, a combined analysis of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c and \u03c0D * D * modes will give more reliable measurements of the resonant parameters. The production cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0Z c (4020) suffers from the same problems mentioned in the Z c (4020) mass and width determination. It would be very important to measure the Z c (4020) production cross sections as a function of the c.m. energy with PWA, to check if the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0Z c (4020) process is from continuum production or from decays of some resonant structures, such as the Y(4230) and Y(4390) observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [159].

However, by constructing a diquark-antidiquark current in QCD sum rules, the predicted mass in Ref. [289] is (4.24 \u00b1 0.1) GeV, which agrees with the Y(4230) mass and disfavors assigning the Z c (4100) as a compact tetraquark state. Due to low signal significance of Z c (4100) in LHCb data, more data will be required to confirm this state. The Z c (4100) \u2212 and its neutral partner can be searched for at Belle and Belle II in B \u2192 K\u03c0\u03b7 c to conclusively determine the nature of the Z c (4100) resonance.",

Amplitude analyses of the three-body \u03a5(5S ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS ) decays with \u03a5(nS ) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are performed by means of unbinned maximum likelihood fits to two-dimensional [284]. One-dimensional invariant mass projections for events in the \u03a5(nS ) signal regions are shown in Fig . Their \u03c0 0 transition modes were measured to confirm their isospin [294], and the open bottom decay modes were studied to understand the couplings to various final states [295]. Note that their decay modes fix the isospin of the Z b states to one.  The large statistics at the \u03a5(5S ) peak make a study of the intermediate states of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS ) possible [284]. After event selection, 1905, 2312, and 635 candidate events are left for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S ), \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(2S ), and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(3S ) final states, respectively. Belle performed a full amplitude analysis of three-body e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS ) transitions and determined the relative fractions of various quasi-two-body components of the three-body amplitudes as well as the spin and parity of the two observed Z b states. The favored quantum numbers are J P = 1 + for both Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) states, and the alternative J P = 1 \u2212 and J P = 2 \u00b1 combinations are rejected at confidence levels exceeding six standard deviations. Results of the amplitude analysis are summarized in Table 4, where fractions of individual quasi-two-body modes, masses and widths of the two Z b states, the relative phase (\u03c6 Z ) between the two Z b amplitudes, and fraction c Z b (10610) /c Z b (10650) of their amplitudes are given.",

The fits to the \u03c0 missing mass distributions with different models parameterizing the line shapes are also shown in Fig. 66, where Model-0 is the fit with only Z b (10610) for BB * \u03c0 events and Z b (10650) for B * B * \u03c0 events, Model-1 is the fit with an additional non-resonant component for BB * \u03c0 events, Model-2 is the fit with a combination of two Z b amplitudes for BB * \u03c0 events, and Model-3 is the fit with only a pure non-resonant amplitude for both of BB * \u03c0 and B * B * \u03c0 events. The relative fractions for Z b decays, assuming that they are saturated by the already observed \u03c0\u03a5(nS ), \u03c0h b (mP), and B ( * )B * channels, are listed in Table 6. However, this assumption needs to be further checked. For example, the decay mode of Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 c is observed with a similar rate as Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c0J/\u03c8 in the BESIII experiment; hence Z b \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 b , as its counterpart in the bottom sector, is expected to happen with a possible rate of a few percent.  While the mass determinations reported above for both the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) are above the nearby openflavor thresholds, more refined analyses seem to prefer lower masses -typically below the threshold [299]. When, however, the pion dynamics is included fully dynamically like in Ref. [300], this leads to an additional energy dependence that pushes the Z b (10650) pole a little above the B * B * threshold. These remarks illustrate that amplitudes consistent with unitarity and analyticity should be used to extract parameters of very near-threshold states reliably (see discussion in Sec. 4.2).",

It is demonstrated that at more than 9 standard deviations \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 p decays cannot be described with K \u2212 p contributions alone, and that J/\u03c8p contributions play a dominant role. These model-independent results support the existence of the P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + [305]. Based on the measured fractions of the P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + [36] and the measured B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 p) [306], the branching fractions B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 P + c K \u2212 )B(P + c \u2192 J/\u03c8p) are determined to be (2.66 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 1.33 +0.48 \u22120.38 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 for P c (4380) + and (1.30 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.35 +0.23 \u22120.18 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 for P c (4450) + [306], respectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the systematic uncertainty on B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 p). Many theoretical interpretations of these two P c states have been developed, including a pentaquark doublet, hadronic molecules composed of an anticharm meson and a charm baryon, a \u03c7 c1 p resonance and so on. The structure of these two states is still an open question, and none of the explanations in the literature have been accepted unanimously [84].",

At the same time they found that the P c (4450) + is composed of two narrow overlapping structures, P c (4440) + and P c (4457) + , with the following resonant parameters: All these values are obtained by fitting the J/\u03c8p invariant mass spectrum directly without doing PWA, so the numbers are subject to change in a more sophisticated analysis and the spin-parities are not determined. It should be noticed that the P c (4312), P c (4440), and P c (4457) are just below the \u03a3 + cD 0 and \u03a3 + cD * 0 thresholds of 4318 and 4460 MeV, respectively, so that it is natural to interpret them as bound states composed of charmed baryons and anticharmed mesons. On the other hand, the two-peak structure of the P c (4450) was predicted in Ref. [308] after LHCb reported the discovery of the two first pentaquarks. In the interpretation of Ref. [308], however, the P c (4450) is a bound state of a charmonium \u03c8(2S ) and a nucleon consisting of two almost degenerate pentaquark states with J P = (1/2) \u2212 and",

            "text": "There should exist other processes leading to the production of pentaquark states that can be accessed by experiments. Moreover, if pentaquark states exist, we should be able to observe more than just a few of them. One would expect more states with either different spin-parity, or different flavor content. To confirm the existence of the found pentaquark states and search for new ones, LHCb did the following analyses: (1) A full amplitude analysis of \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8p\u03c0 \u2212 was performed using an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 [309]. Besides the nucleon excitations, the P c (4380) + \u2192 J/\u03c8p, P c (4450) + \u2192 J/\u03c8p, and Z c (4200) \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 states are also needed for a better description of the data with a significance of more than 3\u03c3. (2) The pentaquark states containing a single b (anti)quark decaying weakly into four specific final states J/\u03c8K + \u03c0 \u2212 p, J/\u03c8K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 p, J/\u03c8K \u2212 \u03c0 + p, and J/\u03c8\u03c6p were searched for, using an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 [310]. No evidence for these decays was found. Upper limits at 90% C.L. on the ratios of the production cross sections of these states times the branching fractions into the searched modes, with respect to the production and decay of the \u039b 0 b baryon in the mode J/\u03c8K \u2212 p, were set at the 10 \u22123 level. (3) The Cabibbo-suppressed decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S )p\u03c0 \u2212 was observed for the first time and the \u03c8(2S )p and \u03c8(2S )\u03c0 \u2212 mass spectra were investigated, but no evidence for contributions from exotic states was found [311]. With a larger data sample, a detailed amplitude analysis of this decay could be performed to search for possible exotic states. (4) Clear signals of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S )pK \u2212 , J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pK \u2212 [312], \u03c7 c1 pK \u2212 , and \u03c7 c2 pK \u2212 [313] were observed, but no intermediate states were investigated. For these processes, LHCb may be conducting further analyses of intermediate states.",

J/\u03c8 photoproduction can benefit from the experimental fact that the pentaquark states are coupled to J/\u03c8p. Note that S -channel pentaquark productions via high energy photon-nucleon scattering can be understood in the framework of the vector meson dominance model for photon-J/\u03c8 coupling. The strong production and decay of the pentaquarks can be connected to their couplings to J/\u03c8p.",

Figure 68 (left) shows the expected line shapes and cross sections of pentaquark states with different assumptions for the J P values, B(P c \u2192 J/\u03c8p), and width from the Joint Physics Analysis Center (JPAC) predictions [319]. Recently the cross sections of \u03b3p \u2192 J/\u03c8p were measured by GlueX at 8.2 < E \u03b3 < 11.8 GeV using about 25% of the total data accumulated by the GlueX experiment from 2016 to date, where clear J/\u03c8 signals are observed [322]. The measured total cross section in bins of beam energy is shown in Fig. 68 (right), and compared to the earlier measurements at Cornell [323] and SLAC [324]. The measured cross sections do not favor either pure two-or three-hard-gluon exchange predicted by the Brodsky et al. model [325], and a combination of the two processes is required to fit the data adequately as shown in Fig. 68 (right) assuming no interference between the two contributions. The total cross section calculations of Kharzeev et al. [326] multiplied by a factor 2.3 agree well with the measurements implying large gluonic contribution to the nuclear mass and are shown in Fig. 68 (right). The P c (4312) + , P c (4440) + , and P c (4457) + states are expected to appear as structures at E \u03b3 = 9.44, 10.04, and 10.12 GeV in the cross-section results shown in Fig. 68 (right). Thus, no evidence for the P c state can be seen. The expected P c (4440) + contribution from the JPAC model-predicted yield with assumption of B(P c (4440) + \u2192 J/\u03c8p) = 1.6% is also shown in Fig. 68 (right). GlueX is planning to analyze the full data sample including data taken in 2018, therefore a higher sensitivity is expected in the near future.

The magnetic moments of a particle are fundamental parameters, which are directly related to the charge and current distributions in the hadrons and these parameters are directly connected to the spatial distributions of quarks and gluons inside the hadrons. Therefore, the magnetic moments provide copious information on the underlying quark structure and can be used to distinguish the preferred configuration from various theoretical models and deepen our understanding of the underlying dynamics. However, works on the magnetic moments of the exotic particles XYZ are rare. Recently, under the assumption of Z c (3900) being a compact tetraquark state, the magnetic moment of the Z c (3900) (\u00b5 Z ) was calculated to be |\u00b5 Z | = (0.35 +0.24 \u22120.19 ) \u00b5 N or (0.47 +0.27 \u22120.22 ) \u00b5 N based on different sets of input parameters with the QCD sum rules [327], and |\u00b5 Z | = (0.67 \u00b1 0.32) \u00b5 N with the light-cone QCD sum rules [328], where \u00b5 N is the nucleon magneton. Also in Refs. [329,330] the electromagnetic multipole moments of pentaquarks were calculated exploiting the flavor structure or with the light-cone QCD sum rule mentioned above, respectively, by assuming, e.g., a diquark-diquark-antiquark andD * \u03a3 c molecular structure with different quantum numbers J P = 3 2 \u2212 . The obtained values of the electromagnetic multipole moments under the two different assumptions show large differences from each other. The magnetic moments of the Z c (3900) and P c (4380) + can be measured in future experiments, for example the electromagnetic multipole moments of P c (4380) + can be extracted through the process \u03b3 ( * ) p \u2192 P c (4380) + \u2192 P c (4380) + \u03b3 \u2192 J/\u03c8 p \u03b3 in the GlueX experiment. Measurements and comparisons with predictions may provide valuable knowledge on the internal structure of these multiquark states.",

A detailed discussion of such phenomenological approaches lies beyond the scope of the present paper, especially given that there exist recent reviews dedicated to all of them -in each subsection devoted to a particular approach we provide the corresponding reference together with a brief introduction to the subject. On the contrary, in this review we put most emphasis on the discussion of effective field theories and lattice QCD, which are rigorous  and systematic approaches. Their common feature is that the calculations have a sound connection to QCD and can be improved systematically.

In these explanations the structures are usually generated by the branch points that emerge whenever the energy crosses a threshold related to a new channel. As will be shown below those are of particular importance for thresholds of two (near-)stable particles in a relative S -wave, for then they can induce pronounced non-analyticities of the production amplitudes. Clearly this kind of explanation is quite appealing, since not only does it provide a reason why many of the additional structures are located right at the thresholds, but also, if confirmed, would remove many states from the particle listings. There are also attempts to explain some structures as interference phenomena. Both concepts will now be examined critically.",

It should be stressed that whenever the total energy (or a subsystem energy) or, more appropriately for relativistic systems, the Mandelstam variable s crosses an N-particle threshold, the corresponding scattering amplitude develops a branch point in the energy plane. The corresponding phase space scales as (s \u2212 M 2 thr. ) (3N\u22125)/2 , where the threshold mass is denoted by M thr. = N i=1 m i with m i for the mass of particle i. The \"-5\" term comes from the four-dimensional delta function present in the expression for the phase space acknowledging that energy integration counts as two powers of the momentum. As a consequence of unitarity the phase space not only enters the expressions for cross sections but also scales the imaginary parts of the corresponding loop diagrams and in this way enters the amplitudes. This allows for a pronounced non-analyticity at threshold, driven by a diverging, discontinuous derivative, of the amplitude only for N = 2. Accordingly we will now focus on two-body reactions.

A cusp is always present when a threshold related to a pair of stable particles in a relative S -wave opens, however, one also sees that its significance depends very sensitively on the value of the scattering length a.",

[303,[332][333][334][335][336][337][338] that various near-threshold states are simply cusp effects without any nearby pole does not look justified. However, in all these works production reactions were studied with final states different from those which generate the cusps [for example, the Z c (3900) is claimed to be a DD * cusp, but studied only in the \u03c0J/\u03c8 final state in Ref. [338]] -thus in this case the transition to the final state is independent of the interaction in the nearby channel. It was first pointed out in Ref. [339] that the observable most sensitive to the pole structure of the S -matrix is the final state that matches the nearby threshold. This transition (up to possible contributions from left-hand cuts) is proportional to the T -matrix in that channel. As argued above, however, a pronounced cusp in the T -matrix occurs only if there is a nearby pole. Based on this, the authors of Ref. [339] argue that at least Z c (3900), Z c (4020), Z b (10610), Z b (10650), and \u03c7 c1 (3872) aka X(3872) should exist as states since they are all connected to signals in the nearby channels. 5 The statements of Ref. [339] were criticised in Ref. [340]. However, in the latter work, the signal in the nearby channel is not generated by the cusp itself, but by the vertex form factor, while the structures in the other channels are still assumed to be driven by the cusp. Moreover, if this explanation were correct it would imply that there should be an enhancement at every threshold, since the vertex factors should be universal.",

[203] it is argued that an interference of the quark states \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415) together with a non-resonant background and only one additional resonance located at 4220 MeV can explain all available data for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c , and \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 . It is even shown that already without this additional resonance a reasonable fit to the data can be achieved. However, this description comes at the price that the coupling of the photon to the \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 channel is smaller than that to the \u03c0\u03c0h c channel although the latter is, contrary to the former, forbidden by spin symmetry. Moreover, in all channels studied a fine tuning of the non-resonant terms vs. the resonant contributions is necessary in order to diminish the appearance of structures near the resonance positions. In this sense the results of Ref. [203] appear not to be a very natural explanation. In Ref. [344] the Belle and BaBar data for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 in the mass range from 3.8 to 4.7 GeV are also explained as an interference of charmonium states with some very broad structure. However, the resulting line shape appears to be inconsistent with the new high-accuracy data by BESIII (see Fig. 22). Moreover, it is unclear how the \u03c0\u03c0h c final state can be understood within this picture.",

It allows one to identify hadrons as compound objects consisting of quarks and antiquarks and provides a framework to describe their dynamics inside hadrons employing the rich and well-developed apparatus of quantum mechanics. In particular, this framework is given by potential models that capture different aspects of this dynamics. Nowadays, the quark model has been replaced in many aspects by more rigorous treatments following directly from QCD. These are effective field theories of QCD, which we will discuss in Sec. 4.4, and lattice QCD, which we will present in Sec. 4.5. Nevertheless, the quark model is still essential for (i) classifying hadrons and (ii) describing some features of near-and above-open-flavor-threshold states, where more rigorous alternatives are missing. An important disclaimer is in order here. The presentation of the material in this subsection pretends neither to be chronological nor comprehensive. An interested reader is advised to check dedicated review papers on the quark model which are supposed to meet these criteria, for example the review [345]. On the contrary, as it has just been stated, in this review, the quark model is only used for classification purposes as well as a benchmark for the properties of hadrons containing heavy quarks, especially those regarded as candidates to exotic states. For this reason, the presentation of the basic features of the quark model contained in this subsection is rather schematic. When its predictions are exemplified, versions of the model which appear to be most recent, rather well-developed, and provide a unified description for both charmonium and bottomonium spectrum are preferred among many others. As such representative examples we choose (i) a relativistic potential model augmented with a heavy-light meson pair creation mechanism [346,347] and (ii) a relativistic quasipotential model of Refs. [48,[348][349][350]. Obviously, for charmonium and especially for bottomonium systems, relativistic effects are supposed to provide only little corrections, so using the relativistic form of the dynamics may be justified by a closer connection with the light-quark sector where the same models may provide a reasonable description of the properties of hadrons.",

Baryons are understood as bound states of three quarks. In this review, following the commonly accepted wisdom, we identify as exotic those hadrons which do not fit into the quark model classification of mesons and baryons. Such exotic hadrons either involve valence gluons (these are glueballs, which are bound states made of gluons only, or hybrids, which are bound states of quarks and gluons) or are made from more than three valence quarks (these are multiquark states). Nevertheless, exotic hadrons can also have the quantum numbers of ordinary hadrons and can, therefore, mix with the latter.",

This description works fairly well even for light quarks (with the exception of the would-be Goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking, in primis the pions), but it is only for heavy quarks that potential models can be justified from first principles. We will show this rigorously in Sec. 4.4.3. The physical reason is however clear: the interaction between constituents may be described by a potential, i.e., an instantaneous interaction, only if the typical time scale is much larger than the average distance between the constituents. This happens if the typical energy of the constituents is much smaller than their relative momentum, i.e., if the quarks move non relativistically. For the latter to be true their masses should be much larger than any other scale in the system, in particular, \u039b QCD , that qualifies the quarks as heavy. The heavy quark masses, m h , being much larger than any other scale justifies organizing the potential as an expansion in 1/m h .",

For heavy quarks the kinetic energy can be non relativistically expanded but it is sometimes treated exactly, see, for instance, Ref. [47]. The potential is usually also expanded in powers of 1/m h . If relativistic corrections are also treated exactly in V one speaks of a relativistic quark model, examples of which will be discussed later in this section. In general, potential quark models reduce the study of quark bound states to a quantum mechanical problem with the entire QCD dynamics encoded in the potential.  In the meson case, the potential V is a function of the distance r between the quark and the antiquark, their masses, spin, momenta and angular momenta. If it is organized as an expansion in the inverse of the masses, m h , the leadingorder term is the static potential, V (0) , which is only a function of r. At short distances, r 1/\u039b QCD , asymptotic freedom constrains the potential to be Coulombic. At large distances, r 1/\u039b QCD , the potential is confining. This is confirmed by lattice simulations of the static quark-antiquark energy, see Fig. 70; for a more recent determination in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD see, for instance, Ref. [352]. Lattice simulations also indicate that the confining part of the static potential grows linearly with the distance r. A simple parameterization of the static potential consists, then, in the sum of a Coulombic and a linear potential,",

            "text": "This parameterization goes under the name of Cornell potential [353]. The parameter \u03ba would be 4\u03b1 s /3 plus higherorder corrections at very short distances, if the linear term was subtracted from the lattice data; the coefficient 4/3 is the Casimir of the fundamental SU(3) representation and the coupling \u03b1 s is the strong coupling of QCD. The parameter \u03c3, whose typical value varies in the range 0.16-0.2 GeV 2 , is known as the string tension. It may be understood as a constant force that prevents color charges from separating. The emergence of a string tension at long distances is suggestive of a description of the long-range interaction between heavy quark-antiquark pairs in terms of the effective string theory [354]. The constant C is a normalization constant of the dimension of an energy; as we will discuss later in the section, it may also serve to mimic the effect of hadronic loops. These parameters can be determined from fits to lattice QCD data, see e.g. Fig. 70, as well as from phenomenological approaches. At higher orders in the 1/m h expansion, the potential V exhibits also spin-and momentum-dependent terms. Like in Eq. (4) for the static potential, also higher-order potentials in the 1/m h expansion may be parameterized by summing a short distance part with a long distance confining one. The short-distance part may be computed in perturbation theory -see Eqs. (68)-(70) below for the leading-order expressions. The long-distance part may be derived from the effective string theory, see, for instance, Ref. [355]. Spin-dependent terms show up at order 1/m 2 h . In the quark model this just reflects the smallness of the fine and hyperfine splittings. We will see in Sec. 4.4 that, in the framework of non relativistic effective field theories, the suppression in 1/m h of the spin-dependent potentials is a consequence of the heavy quark spin symmetry. The first derivation of the spin-dependent potentials goes back to Refs. [356][357][358] and played a crucial role in establishing the nature of the confining interaction in QCD. Finally, we remark that kinetic energy and potential in the Hamiltonian (3) depend on the heavy quark masses. In the quark model, masses are just free parameters like \u03c3 and \u03ba. They are sometimes called constituent masses. Their values are related to the constant C and fixed through fits to the data (typically, to the mass spectrum). If the Hamiltonian is derived and defined in the context of the effective field theory of Sec. 4.4.3, then the mass acquires a precise meaning. If no constant is added/subtracted from the static potential, it is the pole mass, whereas different constants define masses in different subtraction schemes, see Sec. 4.4.1.",

The potential may also be computed through models of the QCD low-energy dynamics and the agreement/disagreement of the model predictions with data or lattice determinations will then provide useful insight in the QCD low-energy dynamics. Most of the models share the basic features of the Cornell model discussed above. In the short range, they agree with perturbative QCD, as a result of asymptotic freedom, and, in the long range, they agree with the expectations of the effective string theory. In the intermediate range they show different behaviours. Examples of model determinations of the quarkonium potential can be found in Refs. [362][363][364][365][366][367].",

The reason is that, because of the spin-dependent potential, the wave function mixes terms proportional to Y J(J\u22121)M (n) and Y J(J+1)M (n). For example, a vector state 1 \u2212\u2212 is a mixture of 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 wave functions, with the coefficients which depend on the dynamics. It is commonly accepted, however, that some quarkonium vector states are predominantly 3 S 1 states [for example, \u03c8(3686) = \u03c8(2S )], while others are predominantly 3 D 1 states [for example, \u03c8(3770)]. Sometimes the relative coefficient between the two wave functions can be fixed from additional symmetry-based arguments. For example, if chiral symmetry is effectively restored (i.e., becomes manifest) in the spectrum of highly excited quarkonia [369,370], then the latter fills approximate multiplets of the SU(2) L \u00d7 SU(2) R chiral group. As a consequence, there must exist two types of vectors,",

The corresponding chiral basis for all quantum numbers is built in Ref. [372]. S -D mixing takes place not only between quark-antiquark states with the same radial quantum numbers, but also between states with different ones [373]. Moreover, since states with similar masses mix more strongly it may happen that higher radially excited S -wave states play an important role in the mixing with D-states that are heavy due to the large orbital angular momentum. There exist claims in the literature that such a mixing may allow, for instance, to get more realistic values of the leptonic widths of vector charmonium and bottomonium states and even to treat some Y states [in particular, Y(4230) and Y(4360)] as genericcc quarkonia -see Refs. [374][375][376][377] and references therein. It is important to notice, however, that the underlying mechanism for this mixing involves creation of heavy-light meson pairs, and, as such, lies beyond the scope of the potential models discussed so far. The effect of hadronic loops and above-threshold states on the quarkonium spectrum will be discussed below. Besides that, although the suggested mixing mechanism is interesting by itself, its reliable implementation requires, inter alia, a better understanding of the mixing patterns between states with different angular momenta within the quark model scheme.",

It was suggested long ago [422][423][424][425] that such a mechanism could be provided by the creation from the vacuum of light-quark pairs with vacuum quantum numbers J PC = 0 ++ , that is, 3 P 0 pairs. For this reason, this model is known nowadays as the 3 P 0 model. 7 See also Refs. [47,[429][430][431][432][433][434] for further details. Since a quark-antiquark pair is created by the operator b \u2020 d \u2020 (here b and d are the quark and antiquark annihilation operators), the 3 P 0 model can be formulated with the help of the interaction Hamiltonian (see, for example, Refs. [434,435])",

In addition, the final-state interaction in the continuum channels is neglected. Although in reality these conditions cannot be met exactly, the results of numerical calculations performed in Ref. [421] show that the claims of the theorems are fulfilled with a quite high accuracy in the spectrum of charmonium. Moreover, those numerical calculations also show that the total hadronic shifts for low-lyingcc states are quite large, of the order of 400-500 MeV. Somewhat lower shifts, of the order of 200 MeV, have been obtained for the same charmonia in a similar approach in Ref. [405]. The conclusion drawn by the authors of Ref.

Nevertheless, the single-resonance amplitude (18) is unitary by construction. Multiresonance systems, instead, have to be treated with care, since unitarisation effects may play an important and sometimes quite unexpected role. In particular, it has been argued for a long time that, when building quark models with coupled channels, unitarisation cannot be neglected, and may be even responsible for the appearance of extra, dynamically generated resonances -see, for example, Refs. [387,437,[440][441][442][443][444][445][446][447] and references therein. In Ref. [437], the effects of unitarisation have been studied in a simple toy model in which a scalar field \u03d5 [viewed as a (qQ) meson] interacts with a set of scalar quark-antiquark fields R n (n \u2208 {1, . . . , N}) associated with the n-th radial excitations of a (QQ) system.

Furthermore, the charged charmonium and bottomonium states observed experimentally cannot fit into the QQ scheme as a matter of principle, since their minimal quark content is four quarks. As detailed in Sec. 3.2, charged states are the Z c (3900) \u00b1 , Z c (4020) \u00b1 , and Z c (4430) \u00b1 in the charmonium spectrum, and the Z b (10610) \u00b1 and Z b (10650) \u00b1 in the bottomonium spectrum. Other additional states claimed in the literature, but not yet confirmed, have been discussed in Sec. 3. All these states are exotic states with respect to the quark model. We conclude by adding a few comments on the spectral identification of the state X(3872), which is the first and best known of the possible charmonium-like exotica. Since the properties of this state were discussed in detail in Sec. 3.1.1, we only mention here that it was observed by the Belle Collaboration in 2003 [5] and that its quantum numbers, J PC = 1 ++ , were unambiguously determined by the LHCb Collaboration only 10 years later, in 2013 [37,58].

In each J PC channel the thick black line indicates the lowest threshold energy where a pair of narrow resonances can couple to the given quantum number in an S wave. Note that the parity of the channels that contain the ground-state D and D * in S wave can only be positive, while by replacing one of the mesons by either a D 1 or a D 2 gives a negative parity.

Indeed, predictions of quark models for this state -see, for example, those collected in Table 9 -are in the range 3900-4000 MeV, that is, from a few dozen to more than a hundred MeV higher than needed. Furthermore, it is clearly seen from Fig. 72 that the mass of the X(3872) is extremely close (within just 1 MeV!) to the neutral DD * threshold -a fact that cannot be explained by the quark model other than by an accident. Such a proximity to an open-flavor threshold implies that this threshold strongly impacts the properties of the state, and that coupled channel effects need to be taken into account -see, for example, Refs. [405,450]. In particular, it is shown in Ref. [405] that coupling of the bare 2 3 P 1 charmonium state to the DD * channel generates, together with a quarkonium of mass 3990 MeV (see Table 9), a very shallow virtual state at the DD * threshold. This virtual state has a very small admixture of cc charmonium in the wave function and is suggested to be identified with the X(3872). In Ref. [450] the peak at the neutral DD * threshold is argued to be due to a BW resonance shifted by channel coupling from its original position of 3954 MeV (see Table 9). In order for the X(3872) to be unambiguously identified with or distinguished from the \u03c7 c1 (2P) on spectroscopic grounds, an interesting observation was made in Ref. [451]. The spin-dependent potential induces a splitting within spin-triplet states of the same radial excitation n and angular momentum L. The center-of-gravity mass of these states",

As mentioned above, we define the latter to be states which demonstrate properties at odds with the predictions of the simplest quark model describing mesons as bound states of a quark and an antiquark. Amongst the exotic states there are some that carry quantum numbers that are incompatible with the simple quark model -for example, the isovector quarkonium-like states introduced in Secs. 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3and others that have quantum numbers allowed for a quark-antiquark state, but show properties at odds with the quark model predictions. Here the most famous example is the \u03c7 c1 (3872) aka X(3872) introduced in Sec. 3.1.1.",

It is fair to note here that Gell-Mann proposed the existence of multiquark states already in 1964, when introducing his famous classification model for mesons and baryons [4].",

This gives about 4 GeV for the mass of the lowest charmonium hybrid and 11 GeV for the one of the lowest bottomonium hybrid. Results obtained by different theoretical approaches, as well as determinations from lattice QCD (mostly in the quenched approximation, but Ref. [131] is a 2+1 flavor dynamical lattice simulation, with a pion mass of about 240 MeV, discussed in Sec. 4.5.1) for the lowest charmonium hybrid are collected in Table 10. We see that, indeed, all predictions are generally consistent with each other and with the simple estimate made above for what concerns the value of the mass of the lowest-lying hybrid. The situation for bottomonium hybrids looks similar. Indeed, the most recent calculations place the mass of the lowest bottomonium hybrid around 11 GeV, also in agreement with the simple estimate made above -see Refs. [192,466,468] for more details.",

The constituent gluon plays the role of an additional gluonic degree of freedom that binds with the heavy quark-antiquark pair to form the hybrid. It can be given an effective mass of about 1 GeV. As was stated above, this is the typical energy gap between the heavy quark-antiquark levels and their first gluonic excitations. Because in this picture the gluon, like the other constituents, is a massive mode, it is possible to describe the interaction among the constituents in terms of a potential and expand it in the inverse of the masses. The valence gluon, located at r g , is connected to the quark, located at r Q , and the antiquark, located at rQ, by two strings with the same string tension \u03c3 as in the quark-antiquark potential of Eq.

The different factors in front of the Coulomb potentials are due to the different representations; the octet potential is repulsive, hence at short distances the hybrid is kept together by the bindings of the quark and antiquark with the constituent gluon alone. At higher orders in the inverse of the masses, one may establish also Cornell-like potentials similar to the static potential. In particular, one gets a spin-dependent potential of the same form as the spin-dependent potential for ordinary quarkonia -see, for example, Ref. [465]. As we will see in Sec. 4.4.4 -and, in particular, with Eq. (75) -the naive constituent gluon potential model misses, however, even the leading, only 1/m h suppressed, spin-dependent potential in the hybrid system. This happens because this potential has no analog in ordinary quarkonium. As a consequence, the spin symmetry is broken more strongly in hybrids than in quarkonia.

Hybrids with a chromoelectric gluon couple strongly to pairs of S -wave heavy-light mesons and, as a result, they become very broad and cannot be observed as resonances [460]. In the following, we will stick, therefore, to hybrids with a chromomagnetic gluon. For hybrids with a chromomagnetic gluon (that is, a 1 +\u2212 gluon), if the heavy quark-antiquark pair is in an S -wave spin-singlet state (S = L = 0) and L g = K = 1, then, according to Eq. (34), the quantum numbers are 1 \u2212\u2212 , that is, the hybrid is a vector state. If, on the contrary, the QQ pair is in an S -wave spin-triplet state, then the hybrid may have the quantum numbers J PC = J \u2212+ with J = 0, 1, 2; hence the quantum numbers include the exotic 1 \u2212+ . These states constitute the so-called H 1 multiplet and are (approximately) degenerate -see Table 12. This pattern of (approximate) degeneracies has been confirmed by model calculations, effective field theory analyses, and lattice simulations. Similarly, the binding of a chromomagnetic gluon with a P-wave heavy quark-antiquark pair (L = 1) with the quantum numbers {1 +\u2212 , (0, 1, 2) ++ } (corresponding to different spin states) gives hybrids with the quantum numbers of the H 2 \u222a H 3 \u222a H 4 multiplets -see Table 12. This (approximate) degeneracy pattern is specific of the constituent gluon picture [192,469]. Different (approximate) degeneracy patterns show up in different approaches. We will discuss the degeneracy pattern emerging in the Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory approach in Sec. 4.4.4.",

Similarly to the case of ordinary quarkonia, but in the constituent gluon model, the relative strength of the strong decays of hybrids into one S -wave and one P-wave heavy-light meson has been estimated in the heavy-quark limit and the corresponding spin-recoupling coefficients have been computed [465].

In the strict heavy-quark limit, the quadruplet of such P-wave heavy-light mesons turns to a pair of doubly degenerate states, P j , with j = 1/2 or j = 3/2 being the light quark total angular momentum. Since the P 1/2 and P 3/2 mesons decay via pion emission to lower-lying heavy-light mesons in the S -wave and in the D-wave, respectively, the P 1/2 mesons appear to be much broader than the P 3/2 ones. This makes it hardly feasible to identify experimentally either of the two P 1/2 quadruplet members (D 0 and D 1 in the c-sector and B 0 and B 1 in the b-sector) in the final state, while this is possible for the other two members of the P-wave quadruplet (D 1 and D 2 in the c-sector and B 1 and B 2 in the b-sector). Then, since the most prominent decay channels of the D 1 (2420) and D 2 (2460) are the D ( * ) \u03c0 modes, the open-flavor decays of the vector charmonium hybrid should be saturated by D * D( * ) \u03c0 final states. The situation with bottomonium hybrids is similar. At this point, it is instructive to compare the production of a heavy-light meson from the P 3/2 doublet accompanied by an S -wave meson in the decays of ordinary quarkonia and hybrids. Such a production is only possible if the produced light-quark pair has total angular momentum equal to 1. This condition cannot be fulfilled in the vector quarkonium decay, as in this case j qq = 0. Therefore, the amplitude for the quarkonium decay into such a final state vanishes in the strict heavy-quark limit [353,482]. Instead, open-flavor decays of (QQg) hybrids proceed through the gluon conversion into a light quark-antiquark pair, which, therefore, carries the angular momentum of a vector, j qq = 1. This implies that there is no suppression of the amplitude for the vector hybrid decay into one S -wave and one P 3/2 -wave open-flavor meson.",

Indeed, the ratio R = \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons)/\u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) has a dip in the energy region around the mass 4230 MeV. Besides, measurements of the electronic width of the Y(4230) give small values [6] in agreement with the expectations for hybrids. Furthermore, one can see a pronounced dip in the cross sections of the e + e \u2212 annihilation into open-charm final states -see, for example, Fig. 74 for the most recent data from the Belle Collaboration [487]. Also, the expectation, discussed above, that the open-flavor decays of the charmonium hybrid should populate the three-body D * D( * ) \u03c0 final states is in line with the recent BESIII data -see Fig. 26. Thus, the Y(4230) could be a hybrid charmonium with a spin 1 [187,192] or spin 0 [188,465] cc core, or a mixture of both. It should be mentioned, however, that there exist alternative explanations for the established properties of the Y(4230). In particular, nontrivial structures in the shape of the inclusive and exclusive cross section can be explained by unitarisation effects -see, for example, Ref. [488]. Also, the proximity of the Y(4230) mass to the DD 1 threshold hints to a large admixture of the molecular component in the wave function. Then, the experimentally observed enhancement in the three-body final state DD * \u03c0 just above the c.m. energy of 4.2 GeV -see Fig. 26 -is naturally explained by the dominating decay chain for the molecule, Y(4230) \u2192 DD 1 \u2192 DD * \u03c0. A detailed discussion of the experimental situation is given in Sec. 3.1.2, and further details of the molecular model for the Y(4230) are collected in Sec. 4.3.4. Finally, it is possible that a realistic picture of the Y(4230) might require that both hybrid and quarkonium (short-range), and molecular (long-range) components coexist in the wave function.",

            "text": "Triggered by the experimental fact that all the candidates for heavy exotic states were discovered in final states that contain a quarkonium and light quarks, in Ref. [489] it was proposed that those states could be viewed as a compact quarkonium core surrounded by an excited light-quark cloud. Later the idea was worked out in depth in Ref. [190]. This structure naturally explains that in the decay the compact core simply stays intact while the light-quark cloud gets radiated off in terms of multipion states. The core and the cloud are held together by the QCD analogue of the Van der Waals force known from molecular physics (for recent studies, see [490,491]). In Ref. [190] this picture is applied to the \u03c8(4260) aka Y(4260) 8 , \u03c8(4360) aka Y(4360), \u03c8(4660) aka Y(4660) and Z c (4430). In Ref. [492] the hadrocharmonium picture is contrasted with the molecular picture for the Z c (3900). This mechanism provides a natural explanation why states like Y(4260) do not decay to D ( * )D( * ) as the lower-lying vector states. Note that only the latter decay pattern is in line with the predictions from the quark model. The hadroquarkonium picture makes distinct predictions for both decay patterns and spin-partner states. Because of the heavy-quark symmetry, states with the same light-quark cloud, but the heavy-quark spin coupled differently, should be degenerate, up to terms suppressed by powers of \u039b QCD /m h 1, where m h denotes either the charm or the bottom mass. This also implies that the spin of the heavy quarks is conserved in decays. For a more detailed discussion of the heavy-quark symmetry as well as the symmetry breaking terms we refer to Sec. 4.4.1.",

Here we largely follow Ref. [492]. In this picture the Z c (4430) seen in the \u03c8(2S )\u03c0 final state can be viewed as a radial excitation of the Z c (3900) in the same way as the \u03c8(2S ) is the first excited state of the J/\u03c8. Spin interactions scale with the inverse of the heavy-quark mass such that the spin of heavy quarks is conserved at least in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks. For the system at hand this implies that the Z c (3900) should be found only in final states with heavy-quark spin equal to 1. This is in conflict with the presence of a Z c (3900) signal in the \u03c0h c final state, see inset in the left panel of Fig. 55. Moreover, in this picture one should expect the decay of the Z c (3900) into open-flavor two-meson states to be suppressed compared to the decay into \u03c0J/\u03c8. However, this is also not the case. Thus, one needs to conclude that the Z c (3900) does not qualify as a state with a dominant \u03c0J/\u03c8 component.",

A model calculation performed in Ref. [494], where a state near the mass of the Y(4260) emerges from non-perturbative f 0 (980)J/\u03c8 interactions 9 supports this picture. However, recently the two states were also seen in the \u03c0\u03c0h c final state with a comparable rate [159] (c.f. Fig. 23), which would imply a significant amount of spin-symmetry violation if the picture mentioned above were right. To explain the simultaneous Figure 75: Family of spin partners of the \u03c8(4260) aka Y(4260) and \u03c8(4360) aka Y(4360) that should exist [493], if both states qualify as mixed hadrocharmonia as proposed in Ref.

The (blue) solid lines then show the predictions that emerge from imposing spin symmetry.",

            "text": "observation of Y(4260) and Y(4360) in final states with heavy-quark spin equal to 1 and 0, in Ref. [191] it was proposed that both states are mixed hadrochamonia from two different seeds: One that contains a J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 charmonium core [to be identified with J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S ) or a mixture thereof with the latter being prominent] surrounded by a 0 ++ light-quark cloud and one that contains a 1 +\u2212 charmonium core [to be identified with h c (1P)] surrounded by a 0 \u2212+ light-quark cloud. In Ref. [191] it is shown that such an assignment allows one to at least qualitatively describe the data in the \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8, the \u03c0\u03c0\u03c8(2S ) as well as the \u03c0\u03c0h c final states, if the seed states are located at 4.30 and 4.32 GeV, respectively. While this mass difference is quite small, it is stressed in Ref. [191] that there is nothing that prohibits such a near degeneracy. In Ref. [493] it was pointed out that the mixing scheme just described allows one to predict four spin-partner states of Y(4260) and Y(4360): One simply has to replace the cores of the seed states by their respective spin-partner states. Accordingly, \u03c8(2S ) needs to be replaced by \u03b7 c (2S ) giving rise to a state with \u03b7 c quantum numbers when being paired with the 0 ++ cloud and h c needs to be replaced by the triplet of {\u03c7 c0 , \u03c7 c1 , \u03c7 c2 } giving rise to states with quantum numbers of \u03b7 c , \u03b7 c1 and \u03b7 c2 . Naturally, the two \u03b7 c states will mix in the same way as their vector partners. The pattern that emerges is shown in Fig. 75. As a special feature, the scheme predicts with \u03b7 c (4140) a relatively light \u03b7 c state that should not decay to D * D but predominantly \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 c and \u03c0\u03c0\u03c7 c0 . This highly nontrivial prediction awaits its experimental confirmation or refutation. Note that in the molecular as well as in the compact tetraquark picture the lightest 0 \u2212+ state is located in mass above the Y(4260) as will be explained in detail in Secs. 4",

In addition, the mass of the Y(4660) is very close to the threshold for the production of f 0 (980)\u03c8(2S ) which led the authors of Ref. [209] to propose that the state is a \u03c8(2S ) \u2212 f 0 (980) molecular state -note that in all previous cases the quarkonium-light-quark resonance threshold was far below the mass of the state such that in those cases a molecular assignment cannot be applied. The implications of spin symmetry are the same as before: If the Y(4660) has a prominent f 0 (980)\u03c8(2S ) substructure, there should exist a spin partner, Y \u03b7 , with similar properties as the Y(4660) and f 0 (980)\u03b7 c (2S ) as a prominent component [210] -this should be true in both pictures if we call the state a molecule or a hadrocharmonium, however, so far experimental searches for this state were not successful -see the discussion in Sec. 3.1. Note that the enhancement seen in \u039b c\u039bc at 4630 MeV is consistent with originating from the Y(4660) [207,208,495].",

In the older literature multi-quark states containing diquarks (a quark-quark pair) and anti-diquarks (an antiquark-antiquark pair), as subclusters were sometimes called \"diquonium\" [8,9]. However, in line with the recent literature on the XYZ states, in this review, we use the term \"compact tetraquark\" to refer to multiquark states that show this kind of clustering. It should be stressed that so far no mechanism is identified in QCD that would lead to such clusters -this issue is discussed a little more in the following paragraph; for a more general discussion of four-quark states we refer to Ref. [11] and references therein. The first microscopic model working with diquark degrees of freedom was presented by Jaffe in 1976 [496] at that time focussing on light quarks. For a pedagogical introduction to the subject of diquark clustering we refer to Ref. [497] and for a recent book see Ref. [498]. Heavylight diquarks were first discussed in Ref. [285]. A comprehensive discussion of further developments of these ideas and their application to the spectrum of the XYZ states can be found in a recent review [499]. In this review we will focus on the results that were later developed on the basis of this work. Results for compact tetraquarks obtained in the quasipotential quark model described in Sec. 4.2 can be found in Refs. [107,[500][501][502][503].",

            "text": "Usually it is found that the spin-zero diquarks are more tightly bound in both the light-quark sector [496] 10 as well as in the heavy-quark sector [508]. In the latter case the two spin configurations form a spin doublet in analogy to, e.g., D and D * or B and B * . It is therefore reasonable that the mass difference between spin-1 and spin-0 cq-diquarks, where c (q) denotes the charm (a light) quark, is within 120 MeV [189], fixed to the mass difference of Z c (3900) and Z c (4020), found to be of the order of the D-D * mass difference. In Ref. [189] it is argued that this phenomenology follows from the condition that the spin-spin interaction is operative predominantly inside the diquarks (driving the mentioned mass difference) and not between the light quarks as assumed originally [285]. For this to happen it appears necessary that the diquark and the antidiquark do not come too close. Therefore in Ref. [509] an idea put forward in Ref. [497] was adapted to quarkonium-like states, namely that they are sitting in distinct wells of a double-well potential as shown in Fig. 76. The emerging structure is characterized by two length scales, the diquark radius, R Qq , as well as the tetraquark radius, R 4q . In Ref. [509] it is claimed that a sensible phenomenology emerges when R Qq R 4q -as possible values R Qq \u223c 0.7 fm and R 4q \u223c 2 fm are advocated. Besides providing a reason for the hierarchy of the spin interactions, the potential of Fig. 76 can also provide a reason why exotics typically prefer to decay into pairs of open-flavor mesons instead of a quarkonium and a light meson as will be discussed in a little more detail below. So far, however, no mechanism was proposed that could explain the emergence of a potential of the type of Fig. 76. Its existence emerges as a phenomenological necessity to justify the diquark picture. An alternative approach trying to justify the emergence of compact diquark building blocks in compact tetraquarks was proposed in Ref. [510] and applied in Refs. [202]. However, since the emerging phenomenology of the two approaches is similar, we are reviewing here the research focussed around the work [509]   Figure 76: Proposed potential between a diquark and an antidiquark forming a compact tetraquark [509]. Here R Qq denotes the size of the diquark while R 4q stands for the size of the whole tetraquark.",

            "text": "Very interesting are the negative-parity states. In the compact tetraquark model those arise from two diquarks in a P-wave that have their constituents in a relative S -wave. Since the diquarks have either spin 1 or spin 0, in total four ground states are possible with J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 , namely [0, 0] 0 , [1, 0] 1 , [1, 1] 0 , and [1, 1] 2 , where the diquark spins are given in the bracket and the subscript denotes the total spin that resulted from their coupling. Note that [1, 1] 1 would produce the wrong C-parity. The preferred assignments of Ref. [508] for those four states are 11 Y(4220), Y(4330), Y(4390), and Y(4660) 12 , since this pattern is consistent with the spin-spin interaction determined in the even-parity sector as well as an analysis of \u2126 c states [508]. This is in contrast with the analysis of Ref. [189], where the Y(4008) is taken as a genuine structure, which is not confirmed by the recent BESIII data, although the existence of a very broad state below 4.2 GeV can not be excluded (see Sec. 3.1.2). As will be explained below, the hadronic-molecule picture for the negative-parity states allows for only three ground states -thus a proper mapping of the singularity structure of the S -matrix should allow us to eventually decide how QCD structures its non-QQ heavy mesons. Moreover, since now all parameters of Eq. (42) are fixed, it is straightforward to make predictions for negative-parity states with J 1. The resulting spectrum is shown in Fig. 77. Clearly, Eq.  [508]. Note that 0 \u2212\u2212 and 1 \u2212+ are exotic quantum numbers that cannot be generated for QQ states.",

As outlined above, the candidates for exotic states typically decay to both open-flavor channels as well as hidden-flavor channels -e.g. X(3872) is seen in D 0D * 0 and amongst others in \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8, 3\u03c0J/\u03c8, Z c (3900) is seen in DD * as well as in \u03c0J/\u03c8, Y(4230) is seen in DD * \u03c0 as well as in \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8, Z b (10610) is seen in BB * as well as in \u03c0\u03a5(nS ), and \u03c0h b (mP) and Z b (10650) is seen in B * B * as well as in \u03c0\u03a5(nS ) and \u03c0h b (mP). Common to all these examples is that, although the open-flavor channels have a lot less phase space available, still the states decay predominantly into those. This is commonly taken as a strong indication for a molecular nature of these states, however, it may also be understood from the proposed diquark-antidiquark potential shown in Fig. 76, in which case a constituent of a diquark must tunnel through the barrier to enable the decay. Since the tunnelling for heavy quarks is exponentially suppressed compared to that of the light quarks, the pattern described appears naturally [509].",

            "text": "An interesting ansatz to study compact tetraquarks is via the large N c expansion first introduced by 't Hooft [512]. Under the assumptions that confinement survives the large N c limit and that the strong coupling constant scales as 1/ \u221a N c which provides a smooth limit for N c \u2192 \u221e, rigorous conclusions about features of the QCD spectrum become accessible -e.g. in this limit there is an infinite tower of stable quark-antiquark pairs generated from an infinite sum of planar QCD diagrams. Until a few years ago there was the belief that all configurations that contain four or more quarks and survive the large N c limit are just given by noninteracting multimeson states [513]. However, in 2013 this was questioned in Ref. [514]: There it was argued that i f there are compact tetraquark poles present in the connected piece of the amplitude, they will also survive the large N c limit, in particular with a width that decreases as N c increases. This work initiated a series of publications -see, e.g., Refs. [515,516]. In all those works the focus is still on planar diagrams. In contrast to this, Refs. [517,518] argue that non-planar diagrams should be favored for providing the origin of very narrow compact tetraquarks. A recent critical reflection on the subject is in Refs. [519][520][521].",

This symmetry is realized in nature, if heavy diquarks form compact substructures in hadrons, for this would allow one to perform a systematic expansion in r QQ /r qq , where r qq denotes the size of the light-quark cloud that may be estimated as 1/\u039b QCD . If r QQ /r qq is a small parameter, one may safely assume the QQ diquark to be in a color-antitriplet configuration, since for heavy quarks the QQ interaction should be largely governed by the one-gluon exchange, which is attractive only in this channel. Then Eq. (43) follows naturally. After the recent observation of the first doubly-heavy baryon [530], Eq. (43) might be also used the other way around to argue that if this (approximate) equality is not realized in nature, then QCD does not favor doubly-heavy compact diquarks. Therefore the experimental search for tetraquark structures should be performed with high priority at, e.g. Belle II and LHCb. In the bottomonium sector, the studies mentioned above find typically a deeply bound bb\u016bd system with J P = 1 + 100-200 MeV below the B \u2212 B * 0 threshold. The issue of multiquarks with two heavy quarks (in contrast to a heavy quark and its antiquark) is picked up again in Sec. 4.4.1 from the effective field theory perspective.",

At the same time \u03b3 is a measure of the typical momentum within the bound state. In the case of the deuteron one finds \u03b3 = 45.7 MeV. In other nuclear systems the corresponding number can be as small as 13 MeV -the \u039b separation energy of hypertriton is only E b = 130 keV -and as large as the almost 200 MeV that is necessary to kick a single nucleon our of 4 He. Accordingly we should expect a similar range of binding momenta also for bound states of two mesons. It should be noted, however, that while the analogy between nuclei and mesonic molecules is apparent within, e.g., potential models, it does not survive the large N c limit: While nuclei should continue to exist in the large N c limit [513], since a baryon contains N c quarks and this adds to the multiplicity of the possible diagrams, mesonic molecules will most probably not [532].",

Indeed, the deepest nuclear bound states that appear (if allowed by the Pauli principle) are S -wave ones. Therefore, in this section we will mainly focus on mesonic systems in the S -wave. However, also P-wave bound states are possible. For example 13 : 6 Li is located 1.47 MeV below the deuteron- 4 He threshold. It may thus be viewed as a deuteron- 4 He bound state. The first negative-parity excitation of 6 Li is located 18 MeV above the ground state [533] -a number of the order of the energy difference between different nuclear shells. Having this said, it is certainly not straightforward to learn something about possible P-wave states in mesonic systems from their appearance in nuclei. We come back to the proposed P-wave hadronic molecules in the XYZ-family near the end of this section.",

However, this ansatz is in general not justified [557] and a careful study of the scales involved appears to be necessary. Those are illustrated in Fig. 78: The length scale of the decay vertex is typically controlled by the mass of the lightest exchange meson that contributes to the molecular bindingthus we have r \u0393 \u223c 1/\u03b2 -and the size of the wave function is controlled by the binding momentum, as was explained above, r \u223c 1/\u03b3.

            "text": "Before discussing examples of molecular candidates and some model descriptions for the XYZ-states, some general remarks are in order. First of all, it should be stressed that relatively narrow, shallow molecular states can only be formed from similarly narrow constituents, since the width of the molecular state is strongly correlated with the width of the constituents [559]. Stated differently, the constituents must be sufficiently long-living to allow the molecular state to form [560]. Focusing on states containing a cc pair and no strange quarks, this implies that only the ground-state spin doublet {D, D * }, with the quantum numbers 0 \u2212 and 1 \u2212 , respectively, and the excited spin doublet {D 1 , D 2 }, with the quantum numbers 1 + and 2 + , respectively, are of interest. The latter pair has a light quark with j P l = 3/2 \u2212 that allows for a decay into D ( * ) \u03c0 in the D wave only, which is the reason for their narrow widths of the order of 30 MeV. The other low-lying pair with positive parity, {D 0 , D 1 } with quantum numbers 0 + and 1 + , can decay to D\u03c0 in the S -wave, which explains their large widths of the order of 300 MeV. This width is too broad to allow {D 0 , D 1 } to form molecular states. Accordingly we expect that molecular states with positive parity are significantly lighter than those with negative parity. The lightest negative-parity molecule can only be a D 1D bound state with quantum numbers J P = 1 \u2212 . The nominal D 1D threshold is at 2420 + 1866 = 4286 MeV and indeed, the lowest in mass candidate for an exotic vector state is Y(4230), located only 50 MeV below this threshold -this connection was exploited for the first time in Ref. [185]. An additional consequence of assuming a molecular structure for the negative-parity exotic candidates is that the lightest exotic pseudoscalar needs to be heavier than the lightest vector by about the mass difference M D * \u2212 M D = 140 MeV, since J = 0 can only be formed from D 1D * and not from D 1D . The resulting pattern of relevant thresholds is illustrated in Fig. 72. This figure clearly shows that, while all states below the lowest S -wave threshold for a the given quantum number show properties in line with the quark model, most of the exotic candidates occur close to or above the threshold.",

Consider a decay chain of the resonance R containing an unstable constituent A, R \u2192 AB \u2192 [cd]B, and study the line shape in the channel cdB. The effect of the finite width of a molecular constituent on the resulting line shapes is exemplified in Fig. 79, where different line shapes are plotted for a pole located on the real axis 0.5 MeV below the AB threshold on the first (left panel) or second (right panel) sheet. The plots are generated for an additional width of 1.5 MeV, due to other decay channels of the resonance, employing the expressions of Ref. [561], which are applicable to narrow states (the formalism was generalised to allow for larger widths in Ref. [562]). The width assumed for the state A is 0, 0.1, and 1 MeV for the solid, dotted and dashed line, in order. A pole on the unphysical sheet can in general only show up as a structure at the nominal AB threshold or above. However, a pole on the physical sheet generates in addition to the AB continuum a structure in the data near the pole location, if sufficient strength from the finite width of the resonance A leaks there. In the inelastic channels, a pole on the physical AB sheet leads to a structure near the pole location, while a pole on the unphysical sheet gives also in this case a signal only at the nominal AB threshold.",

Indeed, they are located very close to S -wave thresholds of narrow resonances: The Z c (3900) lies at the D * D threshold, the Z c (4020) is close to the D * D * one, the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) reside near the B * B and B * B * thresholds, respectively. For the Z b states it is intriguing that they both are seen in three \u03c0\u03a5 and two \u03c0h b channels with a very similar strength in the two-pion transitions from the \u03a5(10860) bottomonium, although the initial state as well as the \u03a5's in the final states have a heavy-quark spin of 1 while the h b 's has a heavy-quark spin 0. This fact appears to be very unexpected since in heavy-quark systems the spin of the heavy quarks should be conserved given that spin-dependent interactions are suppressed as (\u039b QCD /m h ), where m h denotes the heavy-quark mass (see Sec. 4.4.1). In addition, the interference patterns between the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) appear to be different in the two types of channels: While in the former there appears to be a destructive interference between the two structures, it is constructive in the latter. Both features find a natural explanation if Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) are assumed to be B * B and B * B * molecular states [566], for then one finds",

            "text": "For both states the first and second term in parentheses provide the coupling to the final state that contains h b and \u03a5, respectively. An additional support for the molecular interpretation of all four Z's comes from the fact that they all decay, with a branching fraction larger than 80%, into the nearby open-flavor channel despite a very small phase space available in these decays while the phase space is wide open for their hidden-flavor channels. For a comparison of a molecular versus hadrocharmonium interpretation of the Z c (3900) we refer to Ref. [492]. If one admits that the charged states are good candidates for isovector hadronic molecules, it appears natural that there are also isoscalar hadronic molecules. Indeed, let us assume that the binding potential is provided by meson exchanges and that amongst those the most prominent one is an isovector meson exchange (this is an established picture for two-nucleon systems with the exchanged particle being the pion). For the exchange of such an isovector particle between two isospin doublets the ratio of isospin factors of the isoscalar to the isovector channel is -3. An additional minus sign appears when switching the C-parity (clearly, for isovector states the C-parity is defined only for the neutral component). In particular, the picture just drawn would be consistent with a prominent isovector exchange potential if molecular states existed simultaneously in the D * D system with I = 0 and J PC = 1 ++ , and with I = 1 and J PC = 1 +\u2212 . Furthermore, in this scenario there should not be any isovector (isoscalar) 1 ++ (1 +\u2212 ) states. This naive pattern is in line with experimental observations. This is clearly different from the compact tetraquark picture, where each isoscalar state should be accompanied by its nearly degenerate isovector partner. However, this reasoning does not include that, e.g., pion exchange naturally provides large S -wave to D-wave transitions via its tensor force -as soon as those are included one-pion exchange can provide binding also in, e.g., isovector 1 ++ channels (see Refs. [570,571] and the discussion in Sec. 4.4.5). In addition, the channel coupling driven by the tensor force of the one pion exchange also generates a transition of the Z b (10650) to the BB * channel, which, however, is not seen in the data. It is shown in Ref. [300] that this transition is largely absorbed into a formally subleading counter term that needs to be promoted to leading order to render the calculation cut-off independent -this is discussed in some detail in Sec. 4.4.5.",

Accordingly, if there exist resonances generated as two-hadron states in these channels, one should expect a similar population for the final states with the total heavy-quark spin equal to 0 or 1. And indeed, in the mass range covered by the three corresponding thresholds, where at least three vector states 16 , Y(4230), Y(4360) and \u03c8(4415), coexist, one finds the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0h c cross section of the order of 60 pb and the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 cross section of the order of 80 pb -cf. Figs. 22 and 23. It should be stressed that those total cross sections have only a very small contribution from the Z c states. Stated differently, the invariant mass spectrum that shows the Z c states in the \u03c0h c final state (cf. Fig. 55) shows also a strong non-resonant contribution. This is in contrast to the data on the Z b 's in the \u03c0h b channels where the signal is resonant only which in the molecular picture is understood as a consequence of the large mass gap between the \u03a5(10860) and the first relevant two heavy-hadron S-wave threshold, B 1B at 11004 MeV.",

            "text": "Since in QCD the spin of the heavy quarks decouples from the interaction up to corrections of the order of \u039b QCD /m h , one can also predict spin partner states for hadronic molecules. It was stressed in Ref. [493] that the pattern of spin-symmetry breaking is very different between different models for the XYZ states. For example, to leading order in the 1/m b expansion the Z b -states and their spin partners form two multiplets: One doublet which contains the J PC = 1 +\u2212 state Z b (10650) and a 0 ++ , called W b0 , and one quartet, which contains the J PC = 1 +\u2212 state Z b (10610) as well as the 0 ++ , 1 ++ , and 2 ++ states called W b0 , W b1 , and W b2 , respectively [567,570,572]. If one allows for spinsymmetry violation, whose leading effect for hadronic molecules is in this case driven by the B * -B mass difference, the members of the multiplets follow the splitting of the thresholds -see Fig. 80. As soon as one-pion exchange is included, many additional partial waves need to be included in the calculation [573] since the tensor force provides strong S -D transitions. As a result of this, the spin-2 state acquires a width from the now allowed transition from B * B * (S -wave) \u2192 BB ( * ) (D-wave). Because of this additional transition there also appears a sizeable mass shift once pions are included. It was shown in Ref. [570] that the spectrum of spin partner states is very sensitive to the input masses used for the Z b states. A more refined study using as input the masses determined directly from a fit to the Z b Figure 80: Sketch of the mass spectrum of Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) and their spin partner states in the spin-symmetric limit (left) and when the B * -B mass splitting is included (right). In the latter case calculations with (marked by \u03c0) and without one-pion exchange (marked by \u03c0 /) in the potential are compared as detailed in the text. The results underlying the figure are from Ref. [570] based on the input masses for the Z b states from Ref. [563].",

            "text": "A similar pattern of spin partner states is expected to also emerge in case of the isoscalar states in both the charm and the bottom sector. Thus, if the molecular picture is correct, then, in the strict spin-symmetry limit, the 1 ++ state X(3872) should be a member of a multiplet together with one 1 \u2212+ , one 0 ++ , and one 2 ++ state. In addition, in this limit there could be a second multiplet with a 1 \u2212+ state and another 0 ++ state [574]. As mentioned above, the leading spinsymmetry-violating effect comes from the mass difference of the ground-state pseudoscalar and vector states, such that the interactions may be assumed spin symmetric. Still, to constrain all masses of the members of those multiplets, at least two states are needed as input. In Ref. [574] the masses of the X(3872) and of the X(3915), assumed to be a scalar D * D * molecular state, were employed, and, based on this, using a model with contact interactions only, in total four additional states were predicted. Note that an uncertainty estimate of these predictions is in general very difficult, since the X(3915) is located 100 MeV below the relevant threshold and corrections to the pure contact interactions should be expected. However, it is interesting to observe that the spin partner of the X(3872) with J PC = 2 ++ is generated from an interaction identical to that of the X(3872) -thus, the small binding energy of this state with respect to the neutral DD * threshold should directly translate to a small binding energy of the spin-2 state with respect to the D * D * threshold. This observation was confirmed by the explicit numerical calculations of Ref. [574]. Once one-pion exchange is included, transitions from the D * D * S -wave with spin 2 to the DD D-wave become possible which can lead to widths of a few MeV [575] to tens of MeV [573].",

From this input they find that there should neither be a 1 ++ nor a 2 ++ isoscalar state with hidden strangeness.

            "text": "The probably most prominent example of a molecular state is the X(3872), not only because its existence was predicted already in Refs. [534,535] but also because its mass is incredibly close to the D 0D0 * threshold. For a review with focus on the X(3872) as a molecular state see Ref. [581]. Originally, the X(3872) was claimed to be (predominantly) a bound state of D 0D0 * [582,583], which translates to an equal admixture of an isospin-1 and an isospin-0 component. However, this is at odds with experiments. From the first glance one might think that this is in line with the experimental observation that it decays at near equal rates into the \u03c1 0 J/\u03c8 and \u03c9J/\u03c8 final states (see section 3.1.1), the former having isospin 1, the latter isospin 0. However, this can only be understood, if the X(3872) is predominantly an isoscalar state, since the formal \u03c1 0 J/\u03c8 threshold is located below the mass of the X while that of the \u03c9J/\u03c8 channel is 7 MeV above, which is almost as large as the width of the \u03c9. Thus, the decay into the latter channel is heavily suppressed kinematically compared to that into the former, especially in light of the large width of the \u03c1 0 of the order of 150 MeV. Thus, had the X(3872) been to 50% an isovector state it would have almost exclusively decayed into \u03c1 0 J/\u03c8. Moreover, it was shown in Ref. [584], and more recently in Ref. [585], that one can understand the apparent isospin violation in the X(3872) decay quantitatively, if one considers in the decay the large isospin violation provided by the meson loops induced by a large coupling of the molecular state to the two-meson continuum according to Eq. (45): Meson loops in a relative S -wave show a strong mass dependence in form of a pronounced cusp structure exactly at the two-meson threshold, if there is a pole nearby (see Sec. 4.1). In isospin-violating transitions the loops in the neutral and the charged channel enter with a relative minus sign and equal coupling strength. Thus, if the masses of the meson pair in the two channels are equal, they cancel exactly as required by isospin symmetry. However, in reality the D \u00b1 D * \u2213 threshold is located 8 MeV above the D 0D * 0 threshold, which results in an enhanced isospin violation. A second argument in favor of a predominant isoscalar nature of the X(3872) is given in Ref. [88], where it is shown that if there had been a sizeable I = 1 component in the wave function, then the X(3872) should have copiously decayed into the \u03c0 0 \u03c7 cJ channels -with the partial widths larger than the current upper limit of the X(3872) total width. Finally, in Ref. [586] it is shown that a charged component in the X(3872) is necessary to get a quantitative understanding of its radiative decays.",

It is generally believed that the latter scenario unambiguously points at a two-meson nature of the corresponding state. Unfortunately, an analysis of the currently existing data showed consistency with both scenarios [412,561]. The latter reference stressed that in case of a bound state it is necessary to consider the width of the D * meson and also provided analytic expressions for the resulting line shapes that can be used for narrow constituents. Since the width estimated for the neutral D * is of the order of 0.1 MeV and the X(3872) binding energy is 0.2 MeV or lower, one expects a structure below the D 0D * 0 threshold in the D 0D\u2212 \u03c0 + channel, if the X(3872) is a bound state. This structure should be absent if the X(3872) were a virtual state (cf. Fig. 79 and the corresponding  discussion). If the transition rate pp \u2192 X(3872) is large enough, there is hope that the PANDA experiment planned at the FAIR facility (see Sec. 5.1) could provide a direct measurement of this line shape. An alternative method to get high accuracy information of the pole location of X(3872) has been provided recently based on the interplay of a triangle singularity and the corresponding pole [106] -this idea is discussed in more detail in Sec. 4.4.5.",

The reasoning is based on the fact that a state that has a nearby two-hadron channel as its prominent molecular component will couple to it strongly. Accordingly, it appears natural in the molecular scenario for the Y(4260) that the nominal D 1D threshold leaves an imprint, for example, on its line shapes. This is shown in Fig. 81. In all panels the red solid line denotes the results of the full model of Ref. [154]. All model parameters were fixed in 2013 to the spectra  and angular distributions existing at that time. The results for the \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 channel clearly show that the molecular model naturally generates asymmetric line shapes from just a single state. In contrast to this, the experimental analysis of the new data (upper right panel) generate the asymmetry from two BW resonances -see the discussion in Sec. 3.1 above. One conclusion from the molecular picture is that the structure known as Y(4260) should be identified with the Y(4230). We will use this name in the rest of this section.",

At the time when the model parameters of Ref. [154] were fixed, no high quality data in this channel were available and the results shown in the lower right panel of Fig. 81 came as a prediction. Also this calculation contains only one state -still the data and the calculation contain in addition to the peak of the Y(4230) a second structure above the nominal D 1D threshold located at 4280 MeV -here a similarity of the red curve and the typical line shapes for molecules with unstable constituents shown in Fig. 79 should be emphasized.

[185] that within this scenario it appears natural that the Z c (3900) envisioned as DD * bound state gets excited in the Y(4230) decay, since the prime decay channel of the D 1 (2420) is \u03c0D * and, accordingly, the triangle mechanism shown in the left half of Fig. 82 provides an efficient source of low-energy D * D pairs leading to a copious production of the related isovector molecular state. Moreover, the quark model predicts that the D 1 (2420) also decays into D * \u03b3 -thus, the very same triangle mechanism, shown in the right panel of Fig. 82, should again provide D * D pairs, however, now with the opposite C-parity since \u03c0 0 and \u03b3 have C = + and C = \u2212, respectively. Accordingly, if the above explanation for the observation of the Z c (3900) in the decay Y(4230) \u2192 \u03c0Z c (3900) is correct, necessarily X(3872) must also be produced in the Y(4230) \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) reaction [70].

To go beyond this and predict, for example, partner states that should exist given the symmetries of QCD, dynamical equations need to be solved. Those need as input phenomenological models like meson exchange models -see, for example, Refs. [201,[587][588][589][590][591]; many additional references are also provided in the review articles [84,592]. Alternatively, one can construct the scattering potentials in an effective field theory framework. The latter method will be detailed in Sec. 4.4.5 below. Sometimes flavor SU(4) is used to constrain scattering potentials -see, for example, Refs. [568,569,580] -however, it should be stressed that such studies necessarily come with uncontrolled systematic uncertainties, since flavor SU(4) is not a symmetry of QCD (cf. chapter 16.4. of Ref. [593]). Note that some studies constructed on the basis of flavor SU(4) are in fact only sensitive to the flavor SU(3) subgroup and as such show a connection to QCD symmetries -see, e.g., the discussion in Sec. IIA of Ref. [594], where it is argued that in practice what is often employed is only the well established SU(2) symmetry.",

Since a state like Z c (4430) cannot be an S -wave bound state of a pair of ground-state mesons, Ref.

The authors conclude that with their standard parameters they cannot get an isovector bound state in this system, however, they find significantly more deeply bound isoscalar states. If the pion coupling in the model is increased to a strength sufficient to get the Z c (4430) as a bound state, the isoscalar partner states appear to be at least 100 MeV more bound.

Where to truncate the series in the right-hand side of Eq. (50) depends also on the resonance under study -typically the quark and the gluon condensates are sufficient to describe generic quarkonia, while one has to include higher-order condensates to provide a good convergence of the series for exotic states. The values of the condensates are assumed to be known and taken as input parameters. For example, the chiral condensate qq is related with the light quark masses and the pion decay constant f \u03c0 through the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation [602]. One can also extract them from lattice QCD calculations of the same correlation functions in Euclidean spacetime -for recent determinations of the gluon condensate see Refs. [603,604]. Finally, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the sum rules applied to hadronic states with well established properties, such as the masses and the decay widths. It has to be remarked, however, that only a few low-dimension condensates are known and that additional assumptions need to be invoked to treat higher-dimension condensates. In particular, a factorisation hypothesis is usually employed, which implies that higher-dimension condensates are reduced to suitable powers of the lower-dimension ones. This results in a further error, difficult to assess precisely, that contributes to the overall uncertainty of the method. The Wilson coefficients C d (Q 2 ) of the expansion (50) can be expressed in terms of particular sets of Feynman diagrams and, as such, can be computed straightforwardly in perturbative QCD.

In particular, this amounts to constructing the spectral density \u03c1(s) as a suitable function that depends on the masses, coupling constants, and other parameters of the physical hadronic states. Generically, all hadronic states h, for which the matrix element does not vanish, contribute to h| j(0)|0 and, therefore, to the spectral density \u03c1.

The typical value of this parameter is set by the mass scale of the hadronic system under study. The results can be regarded as reliable only if they are robust with respect to a variation of the parameter M in a sufficiently wide range -called the Borel window. Choosing a Borel parameter that is too small amounts to truncating the operator product expansion series before accounting for all contributions necessary to describe the hadronic system with enough precision. On the other hand, too large values of M would allow the poorly controlled continuum to contribute. Thus, the appropriate choice of the Borel parameter is a crucial point in the approach. Furthermore, consistency requires the lower bound of the continuum contribution s 0 to depend on the value of the Borel parameter M [605]. Indeed, it was noticed a long time ago that choosing a constant threshold s 0 results in an insufficient accuracy of the calculation [606].",

On the one hand, as was mentioned above, the operator product expansion series has to be truncated at higher orders to provide a sufficient level of convergence. This implies that higher-order condensates need to be retained in the series. The evaluation of such higher-order condensates requires additional approximations, such as the factorisation assumption. For example, the quartic quark condensate is expressed as qqqq = \u03c1 qq 2 , where the coefficient \u03c1 is expected to be of order one. However, choosing the best value of \u03c1 and estimating the corresponding uncertainty requires further theoretical assumptions. On the other hand, the interpolating current j(x) entering the correlation function needs to be constructed in such a way that it overlaps with all relevant, ordinary and exotic, components of the hadronic state, hence, not only quark-antiquark components, but also hybrid, molecular, and compact tetraquark ones.

For example, the details of atomic physics are irrelevant to describe planetary motion; the only feature of the nucleus relevant to chemistry is its charge. Effective field theories (EFTs) are a theoretical tool that allows to put this generic observation into a rigorous framework. In particular, under some conditions, EFTs are able to describe systems characterized by several energy scales just in terms of a few relevant degrees of freedom. This description is improvable in a systematic way. It has, however, a limited, but well defined, range of applicability.",

The effective field theory that describes QCD at low energies is called Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) [609,610]. Its effective degrees of freedom are the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken SU(n ) A symmetry. For n = 2 these are pions. The exploited hierarchy of scales is \u039b \u03c7 M \u03c0 , where M \u03c0 is the pion mass and \u039b \u03c7 \u223c 4\u03c0 f \u03c0 \u223c 1 GeV is the hadronic scale associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry; f \u03c0 is the pion decay constant. Hence ChPT is constructed as a perturbative expansion in powers of M \u03c0 /\u039b \u03c7 . Because ChPT is an EFT for degrees of freedom that live below the hadronic scale, its matching to QCD is non-perturbative.

The condition m h \u039b QCD is fulfilled by the charm, bottom, and top quarks. 18 In a sense, the HQET describes QCD in the opposite limit of ChPT, however, the HQET is not the large mass limit of QCD. We will discuss the HQET in the following Sec. 4.4.1. If we consider systems made of more than one heavy quark, like quarkonia or quarkonium-like states or doubly-heavy baryons, then more scales become relevant. These are the scales of the heavy-quark-heavy-(anti)quark interaction, i.e., the typical momentum transfer, m h v, and the typical binding energy m h v 2 , where v is the relative velocity of the heavy quarks. At each of these scales one can construct an EFT, specifically, NRQCD at the scale m h v, which will be discussed in Sec. 4.4.2, and potential NRQCD (pNRQCD) at the scale m h v 2 , which will be discussed in Sec. 4.4.3. The version of pNRQCD suited to deal with systems made of two or more heavy quarks bound with some light degrees of freedom, like light quarks or gluons, is called Born-Oppenheimer EFT and will be presented in Sec. 4.4.4.

This symmetry is the heavy-quark symmetry and stands for invariance with respect to the heavy-quark flavor and spin. Moreover, the leading-order HQET Lagrangian is exactly renormalizable. Higher-order operators in Eq. (54) break this symmetry (and exact renormalizability), however, they do it in a controlled, perturbative way. Hence, observables computed up to some order in the HQET expansion depend on fewer and more universal non-perturbative matrix elements than they would in a full QCD calculation. This makes the heavy quark expansion more predictive than a full QCD calculation. We will mention in the following a few implications of the heavy quark expansion for the spectrum of heavy-light hadrons.",

Since the relation between the MS mass (or any ultraviolet mass) and the pole mass is given by a poorly convergent perturbative series (at present, this relation is known up to four loops [627,628]) 19 , an intermediate step is necessary. This consists in rewriting Eq. (55) in a scheme that preserves the power counting of the EFT, which excludes a direct use of the MS scheme, and defines a mass that is related to the MS mass through a convergent perturbative series. There are many possibilities for such a scheme [630][631][632][633][634][635]. The approach favored by the recent lattice determination of Ref.

What will change is the explicit value of the non-perturbative matrix elements, as the light degrees of freedom are different from the mesonic case. More interesting, from a conceptual point of view, is the case of doubly-heavy baryons. These systems are characterized by more energy scales than heavy-light hadrons. One of these scales is the inverse of the typical distance between the two heavy quarks. If it is much larger than \u039b QCD , a case more likely to be realized by doubly bottomed baryons than by doubly charmed baryons, then one can integrate out this scale. At the low-energy scale of the resulting EFT, one does not resolve the two heavy quarks anymore and the resulting EFT is just the HQET (for the heavy antiquark) with the role of the heavy antiquark given to an effective heavy diquark field with the same quantum numbers [637][638][639][640][641][642][643][644][645][646]. This is an appealing picture with predictive power, as it links the doubly-heavy baryon observables to the much better known heavy-light meson ones. Nevertheless, it has been also challenged by lattice data that, at least in the doubly charmed baryon spectrum, do not seem to fully support the diquark picture [647]. It is anyway clear that for any doubly-heavy baryon, and even more so for doubly charmed baryons, the heavy quark-quark dynamics provides a contribution that cannot be entirely neglected and that a diquark picture is theoretically justified only if the typical heavy quark distance is much smaller than 1/\u039b QCD . Doubly charmed baryons have attracted more attention since the LHCb discovery of a resonance in the \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum at a mass of (3621.40 \u00b1 0.78) MeV that is consistent with a \u039e ++ cc baryon [530,648]. Earlier observations by the SELEX experiment remained unconfirmed by other experiments [649,650] and show a huge isospin violation difficult to understand from an EFT point of view [651].",

Even more relevant now that we have an experimental determination of a doubly-heavy baryon. In Ref. [529], using the mass formula in Eq. (55) and experimental input for heavy-light baryon and meson masses, the authors show evidence, at least from the HQET, that there are doubly bottomed tetraquark states bb\u016bd, bb\u016bs, and bbds that are stable against strong decays (these are states for which the decays into two heavy-light meson pairs, and a doubly-heavy baryon and a light antibaryon turn out to be kinematically forbidden), while the doubly charmed tetraquark ccq q , mixed tetraquark bcq q , and heavier doubly bottomed tetraquark states dissociate into pairs of heavy-light mesons. The existence of a stable doubly bottomed I = 0 tetraquark has been predicted by the quark model of Ref. [528], the lattice QCD calculations in Refs. [524,525], and it is supported by the arguments of Ref. [525]. In Ref. [643] it has been pointed out that if the mass of this stable tetraquark is smaller than 10405 MeV (this is the case for the prediction in Ref. [528]), then the lowest-lying doubly bottomed tetraquark with quantum numbers J P = 1 + and I = 1 would also likely be stable against strong decays.",

These energy scales are the inverse radius (or radii) defining the size of the heavy particle system and the energy of the excitations of the heavy particle system. In the case of heavy quarks of mass m h , the inverse size of the heavy quark system is of order m h v and the energy of its excitations is of order m h v 2 , where v 1 is the velocity of the heavy quark relative to the c.m. frame (for simplicity, we do not distinguish here between heavy quarks of different flavor). This is analogous to what happens in the hydrogen atom, whose inverse Bohr radius is m e \u03b1 and whose energy levels are of order m e \u03b1 2 , m e being the mass of the electron and \u03b1 the fine structure constant. The fine structure constant also provides the relative velocity of the electron in the atom. In QCD, the velocity v of the heavy quark may (for weakly-coupled bound states) or may not (for strongly-coupled bound states) be proportional to the strong coupling \u03b1 s . Regardless of this, the relative velocity of the heavy quark is much smaller than the velocity of light, and may serve to hierarchically order the non-relativistic energy scales:",

In the last twenty years, the development of non-relativistic EFTs of QCD has been the major theoretical breakthrough in the description of quarkonium and quarkonium-like systems [12][13][14]. For a more historical perspective, see Ref. [653]. The EFT that follows from QCD by integrating out the energy scale of the heavy quark mass, m h , which is the largest scale in Eq. (61), and that is suited to describe systems made of heavy quarks and heavy antiquarks, is NRQCD [654], see Fig. 84. Although the Lagrangian of the theory is identical to the one of the HQET in the two-fermion and gauge sectors, nevertheless the power counting is different. One consequence of this is that the leading-order NRQCD Lagrangian includes the kinetic energy operators, \u03c8 \u2020 \u2207 2 /(2m h )\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c7 \u2020 \u2207 2 /(2m h )\u03c7.

The advantage there is that, once the heavy quark mass has been integrated out, the lattice spacing, a, is no more constrained to be smaller than 1/m h , which would amount to requiring a very fine lattice if the quark is very heavy. In lattice NRQCD the constraint is relaxed to a < 1/(m h v). Since at the same time the lattice size has to be large enough to include distances of the order of 1/\u039b QCD for quenched calculations and 1/M \u03c0 for full calculations, simulations with very heavy quarks in full QCD are so far beyond reach for the required computational effort. Indeed, still nowadays, lattice NRQCD is the only way to compute non-perturbatively observables involving bottom quarks in full QCD (see, for instance, Refs. [657][658][659][660][661]).",

In particular, NRQCD is well suited to describe heavy quark-antiquark annihilation pro- cesses. These happen at the energy scale m h , which is exactly the energy scale that has been integrated out from QCD. At the low-energy resolution of NRQCD no annihilation is possible and the number of heavy degrees of freedom is conserved. All the information about the annihilation goes instead into the (imaginary part) of the four-fermion Wilson coefficients of NRQCD, which may be computed in perturbative QCD, while the low-energy dynamics of the heavy quark-antiquark bound state is factorized into the matrix elements of the NRQCD operators. Processes involving heavy quark-antiquark annihilations are quarkonium decays [662,663] and productions [663]. The large amount of data about quarkonium production in hadron and lepton colliders, together with the predictive power of NRQCD and its success in most of the predictions, has established NRQCD as a standard tool for studying quarkonium annihilation processes [12][13][14].",

These are essential to describe annihilation processes, but also, more generally, to describe correctly the short-distance interaction between the heavy particles. Because also four-fermion operators projecting on color octet quark-antiquark states are possible, NRQCD naturally allows for production and decay of quark-antiquark states in a color octet configuration. Quark-antiquark states in a color octet configuration constitute a suppressed, in v, component of the Fock state describing a physical quarkonium. Four-fermion color octet matrix elements are necessary in the quarkonium phenomenology [12][13][14]. They are also necessary to cancel infrared divergences in quarkonium decay and production observables and provide eventually finite, physical results [662,663]. It should be noted, however, that the NRQCD factorization has been rigorously proved only for quarkonium decay but not yet for quarkonium production (for progress in this direction see Refs. [664][665][666][667][668]). This unsolved issue may be related with the persisting difficulty in reconciling quarkonium polarization data with naive NRQCD expectations.",

The four-fermion sector of the NRQCD Lagrangian has been derived up to order 1/m 4 h (complete) and orders 1/m 5 h and 1/m 6 h (partial) in Refs. [671][672][673]. Like for the Wilson coefficients in the two-fermion sector, also the Wilson coefficients in the four-fermion sector are not all independent, but some of them are related by Poincar\u00e9 invariance [672,673]. Sometimes it may be useful to isolate the electromagnetic component of the four-fermion operator and of its corresponding Wilson coefficient. This is the case when computing electromagnetic decay widths and photoproduction cross sections in NRQCD. The electromagnetic operators are obtained by projecting on an intermediate QCD vacuum state, |0 , e.g., \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c7\u03c7 \u2020 \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c7 |0 0| \u03c7 \u2020 \u03c8.

The reason is that, while the HQET is a one-scale theory, its only dynamical scale being \u039b QCD , NRQCD is a multiscale theory. The dynamical scales of NRQCD are, at least, m h v, m h v 2 , and \u039b QCD . In more complicated settings, even more scales can be relevant. Hence, one can imagine different power countings, some more conservative, like assuming that the matrix elements scale according to the largest dynamical scale, i.e., m h v, see, e.g., Ref. [674], some less conservative or closer to a perturbative counting, see, e.g., Ref. [663]. What all the power countings have in common is that the kinetic energy scales like the binding energy and that therefore \u03c8 \u2020 i\u2202 0 \u03c8 is of the same order as \u03c8 \u2020 \u2207 2 /(2m h )\u03c8, and analogously for the antiquark.

In the power counting of Ref. [663] one further assumes: 3 , and gB \u223c m 2 h v 4 . A consequence is that the heavy-quark spin symmetry is a symmetry of the leading-order NRQCD Lagrangian.

Indeed, this operator is of the same order as the operators on its right. Matrix elements of octet operators on quarkonium states are further suppressed by the fact that they project on a subleading component of the quarkonium state, the one made of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in a color octet configuration and gluons. The amount of suppression depends again on the adopted power counting.",

            "text": "NRQCD is well suited to describe quarkonium annihilation. However, it is still a complicated theory to describe the quarkonium spectrum (masses, transitions, widths, ...). In this context it is only used in lattice calculations. The reason is that the non-relativistic bound state involves scales, m h v, m h v 2 , and \u039b QCD , that are still dynamical and entangled in NRQCD (as an illustration, see the non-annihilation part of the diagram on the left of Fig. 83). A consequence of this is that, although the equations of motion that follow from the NRQCD Lagrangian as shown in Eq. (62) resemble a Schr\u00f6dinger equation for non-relativistic bound states, they are not quite that. They involve gauge fields and do not supply a field theoretical definition and derivation of the potential that would appear in a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Nevertheless, we expect that, in some non-relativistic limit, a Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing the quantum mechanics of the non-relativistic bound state should emerge from field theory, since field theory may be understood as an extension of quantum mechanics that includes relativistic and radiative corrections. In particular, in the case of quarkonium, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing the bound state should be the non-Abelian equivalent of the one describing positronium. Another consequence is that, as already remarked in the previous section, the power counting of NRQCD is not unique.",

This EFT is pNRQCD [675,676]. Because the scale m h v has been integrated out, the power counting of pNRQCD is less ambiguous than the one of NRQCD. In situations where we can neglect the hadronic scale \u039b QCD , the power counting of pNRQCD is indeed unique, as its only dynamical scale is m h v 2 . Having integrated out the scale m h v, which is the scale of the inverse of the distance r between the heavy quark and antiquark in any matrix element of quarkonium wave functions, implies that pNRQCD is constructed as an expansion in r. This is analogous to how the HQET and NRQCD are constructed. The specific form of pNRQCD depends on the scale \u039b QCD . If \u039b QCD m h v 2 , then one deals with weakly-coupled bound states and the EFT is called weakly-coupled pNRQCD. At distances of the order of or smaller than 1/(m h v 2 ), one may still resolve colored degrees of freedom (gluons, quarks, and antiquarks), as color confinement has not yet set in. Hence gluons, quarks, and antiquarks are the degrees of freedom of weakly-coupled pNRQCD. Weaklycoupled pNRQCD is well suited to describe tightly bound quarkonia, like the bottomonium and (to a less extent) charmonium ground states, the B c ground state, and threshold effects in tt production. If \u039b QCD m h v 2 , then one deals with strongly-coupled bound states and the EFT is called strongly-coupled pNRQCD. At distances of the order of 1/(m h v 2 ), confinement has set in and the only available degrees of freedom are color singlets. These are, in principle, all, ordinary and exotic, heavy and light, hadrons that we might have in the spectrum. Strongly-coupled pNRQCD is suited to describe higher states in the bottomonium and charmonium spectra, as well as quarkonium exotica. If m h v \u039b QCD m h v 2 , the matching to pNRQCD may be done in two steps, first integrating out (perturbatively) m h v then (non-perturbatively) \u039b QCD . The advantage is that contributions coming from these two scales will be automatically factorized in the pNRQCD observables.  ",

[683] and references therein). We have assumed that the heavy quark and antiquark have equal masses; for the case of a quark and an antiquark of different masses, we refer, for instance, to Refs. [623,652,684,685]. The Wilson coefficients of pNRQCD inherit the Wilson coefficients of NRQCD. Hence, some of the couplings appearing in the expansion of the Wilson coefficients are naturally computed at the scale of NRQCD, m h , while others, encoding the soft gluons, are naturally computed at the soft scale, m h v. In weakly-coupled pNRQCD, because the leading potential is the Coulomb potential, the Bohr radius is proportional to 1/(m h \u03b1 s ) and v \u223c \u03b1 s . Finally, like in any non relativistic EFT, also the Wilson coefficients of pNRQCD are related through constraints imposed by the relativistic invariance of the underlaying fundamental theory, QCD. These constraints fix, for instance, the coefficients of the kinetic terms appearing in Eq. (64) to be the ones coming from expanding the relativistic kinetic energies of a free quark and antiquark. Relations have been also found relating the potentials, e.g., (0) s /2 = 0 and many others [357,358,623,673,684].

Potential NRQCD provides therefore a QCD foundation of the potential picture underlaying many phenomenological quark models, a rigorous QCD definition and derivation of the potentials and a range of validity for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation itself (for the somehow paradoxical history that has led from the Lorentz covariant formulation of the bound state problem to the field theoretical foundation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, see Ref. [653]). As we have seen, ultrasoft gluons start contributing, and therefore correcting the potential picture, for the spectrum, at order m h v 4 or m h v 5 , in dependence of \u039b QCD . The potentials are Wilson coefficients of an EFT, they are regularized, undergo renormalization and satisfy renormalization group equations that allow to resum potentially large logarithms in their expressions [677,678,[686][687][688][689][690][691][692]. The proper renormalization of the potentials, highly non-trivial, as it has to account for correlated renormalization scales originating in NRQCD and pNRQCD, guarantees, however, that the final physical results are finite and scheme independent at any order in the expansion parameters of the EFT. This is not the case for phenomenological models.",

            "text": "Weakly-coupled pNRQCD requires the condition \u039b QCD m h v 2 to be fulfilled. This condition is realized if the size of the quarkonium is smaller and the revolution time not larger than the typical size of a heavy-light hadron. Examples are the bottomonium ground state, the ground state of the B c system, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the charmonium ground state, and the first bottomonium excited states. We recall that in a Coulombic system the size is proportional to the inverse of the mass and to the principal quantum number. The precise dependence on the latter follows from the precise definition of the size. A review on applications of weakly-coupled pNRQCD to several tightly bound quarkonia can be found in Ref. [693]. Weak-coupling determinations of the bottomonium ground state masses are typically used to extract the charm and bottom masses [633,[694][695][696][697][698][699][700][701][702]. Hence, they provide alternative observables for the extraction of the heavy quark masses to the heavy-light meson masses discussed in Sec. 4.4.1. The results are consistent with the ones presented in Sec. 4.4.1, but with some different systematics, although they face some similar issues, like the use of a proper subtraction scheme for the mass. Nowadays the precision is N 3 LO, the determination of the bottom mass includes the effects due to a finite charm mass, and the observables used are not only the masses of the vector states, \u03a5(1S ) and J/\u03c8, but also the masses of the pseudoscalar states, \u03b7 b following the BaBar discovery [703] and \u03b7 c , and the B c ground state following the CDF discovery [704] and the latest LHCb precise measurements [705][706][707][708]. In Ref. [701] the bottom and charm masses have been extracted from a global fit up to n = 3 bottomonium states. On the other hand, once the heavy quark masses have been established on one set of spectroscopy observables, they can be used for others like the B c mass or the B c spectrum (see Ref. [709] for an early reference and Ref. [685] for a status of the art calculation at N 3 LO). Fine and hyperfine splittings of charmonium and bottomonium have been computed perturbatively in Refs. [710,711] and at to NLL accuracy in Ref. [712], similarly for the B * c -B c hyperfine splitting in Ref. [713]. After an effort that lasted more than one decade the whole perturbative heavy quarkonium spectrum has been computed at N 3 LO [687,[714][715][716][717][718][719]. Recently, this result has been further improved reaching N 3 LL accuracy up to a missing contribution of the two-loop soft running [691,692]. The N 3 LL order represents the presently achievable precision of these calculations. Going beyond this precision will require a major computational effort, like the four-loop determination of the static potential, that appears beyond near reach. Electromagnetic decays of the bottomonium lowest levels have been computed including N 2 LL corrections in Refs. [720,721]. A different power counting that includes at leading order the exact static potential has been used for these quantities in Ref. [722]. Corrections to the wave function and leptonic decay width of the \u03a5(1S ) at N 3 LO have been computed in Refs. [723,724]. Non-perturbative corrections in the form of condensates have been included in Refs. [725,726]. Radiative quarkonium decays have been analyzed in Refs. [727][728][729][730][731][732]. Radiative and inclusive decays of the \u03a5(1S ) may also serve as a determination of \u03b1 s at the bottom mass scale [733]. Radiative transitions, M1 and E1, at relative order v 2 in the velocity expansion have been computed in various power countings in Refs. [734][735][736][737]. Noteworthy, pNRQCD may explain the tiny \u03a5(2S ) \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b7 b (1S ) branching fraction measured by BaBar [738]. Finally, the photon line shape in the radiative transition J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b7 c (1S ) has been studied in Ref. [739].",

Lattice QCD shows evidence that the quarkonium static energy is separated by a gap of order \u039b QCD from the energies of the gluonic excitations between the static quark-antiquark pair, see Fig. 86. If this condition is also fulfilled by the binding energies, i.e., if the binding energies of the states that can be constructed out of the quarkonium static energy are separated by a gap of order \u039b QCD from the binding energies of the states that can be constructed out of the static energies of the gluonic excitations, and from open-flavor states, then one can integrate out all these latter higher energy states. The resulting EFT is just made of a quark-antiquark color singlet field, whose modes are the quarkonium states, and light hadrons. The coupling of quarkonia with light hadrons has been considered in the framework of pNRQCD in Figure 86: The quarkonium static energy (labeled \u03a3 + g ) vs the energy of the first gluonic excitation between a static quark-antiquark pair (labeled \u03a0 u ) as a function of the distance between the quark and the antiquark. The quenched (green) and two-flavor (blue) lattice data are from [744]. The unit r 0 is about 0.5 fm.",

            "text": "The Hamiltonian, h S , has the same form, given by Eqs. (64)- (67), as in weakly-coupled pNRQCD. The equation of motion is the Schr\u00f6dinger equation 71, which provides a field theoretical foundation of potential models also in the strong-coupling regime. It also allows us to go systematically beyond the potential picture by including couplings with light degrees of freedom. All the complications of the non-perturbative dynamics are encoded in the potentials, which at order 1/m h is V (1) s and at order 1/m 2 h are the spin-independent and spin-dependent terms identified in Eqs. (66) and (67). The crucial points about the EFT treatment that distinguish it from phenomenological potential models can be summarized as follows. (i) The potentials can be written as the products of Wilson coefficients, factorizing contributions from the high-energy scale, m h , and low-energy matrix elements, encoding contributions coming from the scales m h v and \u039b QCD . The exact expressions follow from matching pNRQCD with its high-energy completion, which is NRQCD. (ii) The high-energy Wilson coefficients of pNRQCD are inherited from NRQCD. These are the Wilson coefficients listed up to order 1/m 2 h in the NRQCD Lagrangian (62). As we discussed there, they are known expansions in the strong coupling (up to the computed orders). Because the NRQCD Wilson coefficients have a real part and an imaginary part, also the pNRQCD potentials develop a real part, responsible for the quarkonium binding, and an imaginary part, responsible for the quarkonium annihilation. At higher orders, also contributions coming from the scale m h \u039b QCD may become relevant; these contributions can be computed in perturbation theory as m h \u039b QCD \u039b QCD [743]. i ln W/T , where W is the expectation value of a rectangular Wilson loop of spatial extension r and temporal extension T [746][747][748][749]. Similarly, the low-energy real parts of the other potentials can be expressed in terms of Wilson loops and field insertions on them [356,740,741]. These Wilson loops may be computed in weak-coupling QCD giving back the weak-coupling potentials listed in Eqs. (68)-(70) [750]. More relevant from the phenomenological point of view is, however, their numerical nonperturbative determination via lattice QCD. Indeed, the computation of these potentials has a long history that begins with the inception of lattice QCD. Their most recent determinations can be found in Refs. [359][360][361]. One should remark that lattice calculations of the quarkonium potentials have not included so far 1/m 2 h momentum-and spinindependent potentials, and have been limited to the pure SU(3) gauge theory. Potentials that have not been computed on the lattice may be estimated in the long distance using the effective string theory, which has also proved to be very successful in interpreting the existing long-distance data [355,[750][751][752]. The low-energy contributions to the imaginary parts of the potential are matrix elements of the NRQCD four-fermion operators. Hence they are local terms proportional to \u03b4 3 (r) or derivatives of it. Non-perturbative contributions are encoded into constants that may be expressed in terms of momenta of correlators of chromoelectric and/or chromomagnetic fields [674,742]. They may be fixed on data or computed with lattice QCD, but lattice calculations have not been intensively pursued, so far, for these quantities. (iv) Finally, because pNRQCD retains the correct ultraviolet behaviour of the low-energy EFT, it is renormalizable order by order in the expansion parameters in both its weak-coupling and strong-coupling versions. In particular, quantum-mechanical perturbation theory can be implemented at any order without incurring into uncanceled divergences.",

The advantage with respect to the NRQCD approach is that, while the NRQCD four-fermion matrix elements depend on the quarkonium state, their pNRQCD expression factorizes all the quarkonium dependence into the wave function at the origin (or its derivatives) squared. The wave function at the origin squared gets multiplied by momenta of correlators of field-strength tensors, F, that are universal, quarkonium independent, constants. Schematically, one obtains for the expression of a generic NRQCD four-fermion matrix element in pNRQCD that 4-fermion \u223c |wave-function(0)| 2 \u00d7 dt F(t) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 F(0) . This leads to a significant reduction in the number of non-perturbative parameters and allows to use information gained in the charmonium sector to make predictions in the bottomonium one. Electroproduction of quarkonium may be treated in pNRQCD in the same way. Hadroproduction, instead, has not been formulated yet in the pNRQCD language, owing in part to the difficulty to state and prove rigorously the NRQCD factorization theorem in that context, see discussion and references in the previous section. Finally, very recently pNRQCD conbined with the multipole expansion has been used to compute quarkonium hadronic transitions [753].",

The key observation is that the non-relativistic hierarchy of scales given in Eq. 61, where v is the relative heavy-quark velocity, is preserved. This allows one to systematically integrate out these scales to describe eventually the baryon with a suitable EFT. If the heavy quarkquark distance is of the order of 1/\u039b QCD , then the valence light-quark affects the quark-quark potential. Elsewhere, if the heavy quark-quark distance is smaller than 1/\u039b QCD , then we may disentangle the quark-quark dynamics, described by a perturbative quark-quark potential, from the coupling of the heavy-quark pair with the light quark. Since in this last case, the light quark sees the heavy-quark pair as a pointlike particle, its interaction with the heavy-quark pair is described by the HQET. Processes involving light hadrons in final or intermediate states may be described in the framework of the heavy-baryon chiral effective theory [756]. Similarly, one can devise EFTs for describing lowenergy modes of baryons made of three heavy quarks. These states have not been discovered yet in experiments, but they offer a unique tool to study confinement and the transition region from the Coulomb regime to the confined one in a non-trivial geometrical setting [754]. These issues are already addressed by lattice computations of the three-quark static potential [757][758][759]. Higher-order potentials in the 1/m h expansion have been defined in terms of Wilson loops and field insertions on them, as in the quarkonium case, and may be eventually computed on the lattice providing, for instance, first principle determinations of the heavy baryon fine and hyperfine splittings [754].",

            "text": "Possible bound states made of two quarkonia or of a quarkonium and a nucleon (hadroquarkonium, see Sec. 4.3.2) may be characterized by even lower energy scales than those characterizing the binding in quarkonia or baryons made of at least two heavy quarks. These lower energy scales are those associated with the pion exchanges responsible for the long-range interaction. One can treat these systems in an EFT framework by starting from the pNRQCD description of the quarkonium and the heavy-baryon chiral effective theory description of the nucleon. The longrange pion exchange interaction sets the scale of the typical size of the system to be of the order of 1/M \u03c0 , i.e., much larger than the size of the quarkonium and even larger than its typical time scale, which is of the order of the inverse of the binding energy. Once modes associated with the quarkonium binding energy and M \u03c0 have been integrated out, the quarkonium-quarkonium or the quarkonium-nucleon interaction is described by a potential that, in this way, has been systematically computed from QCD. The coupling of quarkonium with the pions is encoded in a Wilson coefficient that may be identified with the quarkonium chromoelectric polarizability. In the quarkonium-quarkonium system, the lowest energy EFT describing modes of energy and momentum of order m 2 \u03c0 /(2m h ) is called van der Waals EFT (WEFT) [490,745]. The resulting potential is, in fact, the van der Waals potential. In the quarkonium-nucleon system, the lowest energy EFT describing modes of energy and momentum of order M 2 \u03c0 /(2\u039b \u03c7 ) has been dubbed potential quarkonium-nucleon EFT (pQNEFT) [491]. Interest in these systems has been renewed recently after the discovery by the LHCb Collaboration of the pentaquark states P c (4380) + and P c (4450) + , with valence quark content P + c =ccuud, as intermediate resonant states in the weak decay process \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 p [36,305], see Sec. 3.3.2. In the next section, we will deal with higher excitations of a heavy quark-antiquark pair due to gluons (hybrids) and, on a more qualitative level, due to light quark pairs (generic tetraquarks). The framework will be that one of strongly-coupled pNRQCD. The specific application of strongly-coupled pNRQCD to these systems will require some extra assumptions that allow for further expansions in the EFT and, therefore, in the observables. In the case of molecular physics (i.e., QED), the leading-order term in the expansion corresponds to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Although this is no more the case in QCD, we will nevertheless call the resulting EFT, the Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT).",

            "text": "In the previous section, we have studied strongly-coupled quarkonia under the assumption that the quarkonium energy levels develop a mass gap of order \u039b QCD with respect to the spectrum of quarkonium hybrids, quarkonium plus glueballs and other exotic states. This assumption allows one to integrate out all degrees of freedom with the exception of the heavy quark-antiquark pair and cast their contribution into a potential. We may call this the Born-Oppenheimer assumption. If we extend it to hybrid (tetraquark) heavy quarkonium states, we may picture each hybrid (tetraquark) state as being a vibrational mode of a heavy quark-antiquark pair inside a potential. The hybrid (tetraquark) potential may be identified with the energy of a gluonic (light-quark pair) excitation between the heavy quark-antiquark pair with given quantum numbers. Ideally, gluonic (light-quark pair) excitations are separated from each other by a gap of order \u039b QCD , while vibrational modes of a heavy quark-antiquark pair inside a given potential have a typical energy of order m h v 2 , which is assumed to be much smaller than \u039b QCD . An illustration of the distribution of vibrational modes for the different quarkonium and hybrid (or tetraquark) potentials, under the above assumptions, is shown in Fig. 87. A Born-Oppenheimer picture to describe quarkonium hybrids has been suggested in Refs. [192,469,476]. An EFT for quarkonium hybrids in the framework of strongly-coupled pNRQCD under the Born-Oppenheimer assumption has been developed in Ref. [470] under the name of Born-Oppenheimer EFT (BOEFT). A similar approach is in Refs. [193,471]. An extension to include excitations due to light quarks, i.e., tetraquarks, has been suggested in Refs. [467,760], and more explicitly worked out in Refs. [467][468][469]761]. For recent related work see Ref. [762].",

Concerning the size of the different terms appearing in the Lagrangian (73), the temporal derivative, the kinetic term and the leading-order (static) potential (up to a constant shift) are of order m h v 2 . As discussed in Ref. [470], this is also the size of the nonadiabatic coupling. For diatomic molecules the counting is different, essentially because the size of the electron cloud and the distance of the two atoms are in the molecule of the same order, while for hybrids the distance of the heavy quark-antiquark pair is of order 1/(m h v), i.e., smaller than the size of the hadron, which is of order \u039b QCD . As a consequence the adiabatic coupling may be treated as a perturbation in diatomic molecules, while it contributes at leading order to heavy quarkonium hybrids. Another consequence is that, since in diatomic molecules there is no special hierarchy between these two lengths, there is neither a special symmetry at short distances nor a corresponding degeneracy pattern, which are instead typical, as we have seen, of heavy quarkonium hybrids.",

A physical consequence of this mixing is the so-called \u039b-doubling, i.e., the lifting of degeneracy between states with opposite parity. The effect is also present in molecular physics, however, there \u039b-doubling is a subleading effect, while it is a leading-order effect in the spectrum of quarkonium hybrids. The eigenstates of the Eqs. (74) are organized in the multiplets shown in Table 12. In the adiabatic approximation the multiplets H 1 and H 2 would be degenerate [467][468][469]. The solution of the full set of equations (74) is the spectrum shown in Fig. 89. The spectrum has been computed using for the charm quark the mass in the renormalon subtraction (RS) scheme m c RS = 1.477 (40) GeV [633,767] (for more details about masses in renormalon subtraction schemes see also Sec. 4.4.1). The gluelump masses, which enter in the normalization of the hybrid potentials, have been computed in the same scheme and assigned an uncertainty of \u00b10.15 GeV, which is the largest source of uncertainty in the hybrid masses [767]. hybrids or for states with a large hybrid component are the Y(4230) and Y(4390) because of their significant width into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c . In the hybrid picture this decay does not need spin flipping of the heavy quark-antiquark pair, which is in a spin zero state. Spin-flipping terms are suppressed in the heavy quark limit. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out in Ref. [193] that mixing with spin one quarkonium states happens already at order 1/m h (see below). This possibly large mixing may allow for significant widths also into final states with spin one quarkonia, in particular \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. In Ref. [192] a similar study as the one summarized in Fig. 89    [296], see Sec. 3.2.3. To these we can add the recently observed signal by Belle with a mass of M \u03a5(10750) = (10752.7 \u00b1 5.9 +0.7 \u22121.1 ) MeV, which may also qualify as an H 1 multiplet bottomonium hybrid candidate [7].",

[130] using anisotropic lattices with 2 + 1 flavors at a pion mass of 396 MeV, and in Ref. [131] in an improved setting at a pion mass of 236 MeV, see Fig. 96. Lattice data are consistent with the computations reported in Fig. 89, although the quoted lattice errors are somewhat smaller but these are only the statistical uncertainties -see Sec. 4.5.1 for a discussion of these lattice results and potential systematic uncertainties. In the case of the H 1 multiplet the smaller errors make the data sensitive to the spin splittings of the states inside the multiplet. The spin splittings provide relevant information on the heavy quarkonium hybrid spin interaction, as we will discuss at the end of this section. The bottomonium hybrid spectrum has been studied, so far, only on quenched lattices: in Ref. [476] using anisotropic lattices and treating the bottom-antibottom pair non relativistically in the framework of lattice NRQCD, and in Ref. [477] using anisotropic lattices and treating the bottom-antibottom pair fully relativistically. At the present state of our knowledge the results of Ref. [476] appear consistent with the mass values of the bottomonium hybrid multiplets reported above from Ref. [192], while those of Ref. [477] show some major discrepancies. We refer to Ref.

Using hybrid operators and computing correlation functions and spectral functions up to dimension-six condensates, the sum rules stabilize and provide mass predictions. The masses for the H 1 hybrids are between 3.4 GeV and 4 GeV in the charmonium sector, between 9.7 GeV and 9.9 GeV in the bottomonium sector, and between 6.8 GeV and 7.2 GeV for the cb hybrids. Hence, for this multiplet they are somewhat smaller than in the analysis of Ref. [192]. The other multiplets are consistent with Ref. [192], although the 1 ++ state of the charmonium H 2 multiplet and the H 3 multiplet tend to be heavier. Similar observations also hold for the 1 + state of the bc H 2 multiplet and the H 3 multiplet, while the bottomonium 0 +\u2212 hybrid state of the H 2 multiplet tends to be lighter.",

            "text": "As remarked above, the lattice data of Ref. [131] are sensitive to the charmonium hybrid spin splittings (but it is important to remember that these data suffer from systematic uncertainties). In Ref. [472], this information has been used to constrain the heavy quarkonium hybrid spin-dependent potential. The heavy quarkonium hybrid spindependent potential may be organized, like in the quarkonium case, as an expansion in 1/m h , see Eqs. (65) and (67). Differently from the quarkonium case, the hybrid potential gets a first contribution already at order 1/m h [193]. For the implications of this term to the spin splittings see Ref. [471]; heavy quarkonium hybrid spin splittings in the Born-Oppenheimer framework with NRQCD have been also analyzed in Ref. [771]. The 1/m h potential is the leading contribution to the spin-dependent potential. It stems from the expectation value of the chromomagnetic operator, c F \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c3\u2022 B/(2m h )\u03c8+charge conjugation, on the hybrid state (the operator appears in the NRQCD Lagrangian (62), and, in the framework of pNRQCD, among the operators listed in Ref. [623]). It is of order \u039b 2 QCD /m h . The same operator does not contribute at leading order to matrix elements of quarkonium states as its projection on quark-antiquark color singlet states vanishes. Hence, spin splittings are remarkably less suppressed in heavy quarkonium hybrids than in heavy quarkonia. For the lowest-lying hybrid excitations of a gluonic operator with quantum numbers 1 +\u2212 , the 1/m h spin-dependent potential takes the form V (1) 1  where K i j k = i ik j is the angular momentum operator of the spin one gluons. Also the 1/m 2 h spin-dependent potential presents some new structures with respect to the corresponding quarkonium potential (67):",

[192]. The non-perturbative contributions are determined from the fit of the charmonium hybrid spectrum of Ref. [131], see contributions to the potentials listed in Eqs. (75) and (76) (blue, central boxes). We see that the pattern of splittings induced by the perturbative contributions alone is opposite to the data. It is also opposite to the quarkonium case, as the signs of all spin-dependent potentials is reversed at leading order. Hence, non-perturbative contributions are crucial to bring the splittings in agreement with lattice data, consistently with the fact that the non-perturbative contribution proportional to V S K (r) is the dominant spin-dependent potential for hybrids. In Ref. [472], the fitted contributions turn out to scale, in powers of \u039b QCD , as expected by the power counting of the EFT. If the non-perturbative potentials may be organized according to the multipole expansion, then information gained from the charmonium hybrid spin splittings can be used to predict, for each multiplet, the bottomonium hybrid spin splittings. The predictions are shown in Fig. 91. We see again that the characteristic pattern of spin splittings induced by the perturbative contributions (green, left boxes) is reversed by the full result that includes the non-perturbative contributions (blue, right boxes).",

An early study is Ref.

A relation of this model with the Born-Oppenheimer picture was first suggested in Refs. [452,772]. Later it was worked out in Ref. [192], see Fig. 89 and the possible H 1 assignment of the Y(4230). More recently, heavy quarkonium hybrid inclusive transitions into quarkonia have been studied in the BOEFT framework in Ref.

[193] it was emphasized that the same NRQCD operator responsible for the appearance of the 1/m h spindependent potential (75) is also responsible for the appearance of a mixing potential between hybrids and ordinary quarkonia at order 1/m h . The mixing potential mixes spin 0 (1) hybrids with spin 1 (0) quarkonia and may explain, in dependence of the strength of the mixing, which is of order \u039b 2 QCD /m h and non-perturbative, why some hybrid candidates appear to decay both into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c . This could be the case of the Y(4230), which, according to Ref. [193], has a potentially large mixing with the ordinary charmonium 2D, 1 \u2212\u2212 , state.

The fields is limited by the fact that the potentials have not, even in their static limit, been measured on the lattice. For recent studies in this direction we refer to Sec. 4.5.3. Hence, the situation is different from the hybrid case, where static hybrid energies are known since long time. In particular, an analysis of the type performed for heavy quarkonium hybrids in the previous paragraphs is at the moment not possible for quarkonium tetraquarks. In Refs. [467,469], to circumvent this difficulty, it was assumed that the tetraquark static energies have the same shape as the hybrid ones. In this way, it became possible for the authors to provide preliminary mass estimates and to make predictions on the ordering of the tetraquark spectrum. Clearly, the lattice computation of the tetraquark static energies would provide a major input for studies based on the Born-Oppenheimer picture.",

[611] for a comprehensive review of the subject. Here we will focus on the treatment of few-hadron bound systems. On the one hand, the formalism must be formulated non-perturbatively. But, on the other hand, in an effective field theory one needs to identify a proper expansion parameter in such a way that the results can be improved systematically by going to higher orders in this expansion. It was Weinberg in 1990 who argued that those seemingly contradictory requirements can be brought together, if one performs an expansion not of the full amplitude but only of the scattering potential which then should be resummed by some wave equations [774]. The argument is based on the following observation: Assume the scattering of two heavy particles interacting via the exchange of a light meson. As illustrated in Fig. 92, at the leading one-loop level the scattering potential contains six contributions: the ladder, the crossed box, the triangle, the football, the pion tadpole and the vertex correction. Clearly, the diagrams (a), (b) and (f) scale equally with respect to the coupling constants, however, a detailed analysis reveals that the ladder diagram scales with an additional factor \u03c0(2\u00b5/p) compared to the other two, where \u00b5 denotes the reduced mass of the two heavy particles and p is the typical momentum of the two-hadron state.",

The enhancement factor comes from the two-hadron cut, which is present only in diagrams that have a time slice that cuts only two heavy hadron lines (in the language of few-body physics these kinds of diagrams are called two-body reducible). Thus, for momenta small compared to the masses of the two hadrons, the ladder diagram is enhanced compared to all the other one-loop diagrams. This remains true at higher orders in perturbation theory and thus justifies a resummation of at least part of the potential constructed to a given order in perturbation theory, where \"potential\" means all contributions that are two-hadron irreducible. In contrast to Weinberg's scheme, it was argued in Refs. [775,776] that instead of the potential the full amplitude should be analyzed under the assumption that there is a pole present very near threshold. Within this scheme only a momentum-independent counterterm needs to be resummed while pion exchange is perturbative. However, in Ref. [777] it was shown that, as soon as the tensor force of the one-pion exchange contributes, the expansion that results from the scheme of Refs.

            "text": "As in case of studies of the few-nucleon system, also for the interactions of heavy mesons both schools coexist: While some authors propose that only contact terms need to be resummed and one-pion exchange should be treated perturbatively [110,574,577,[778][779][780], others call for a resummation of both contact terms and pion exchange [300,537,570,573,781]. For example, in Ref. [779] it is argued that the tensor force of the pion should be reduced significantly here compared to the two-nucleon system as a result of a smaller effective pion mass and a smaller coupling that invalidate the argument of Ref. [777]. However, in Ref. [300] it is shown that the fit to the line shapes of Z b (10610) and Z b (10650), especially in the lower elastic channel, improves once the tensor force of the pion is included, pointing at the need for a non-perturbative inclusion of the pion exchange -see Fig. 93 -and thus calling for an application of Weinberg's counting also in heavy meson systems. This work will be discussed in a little more detail below. From now on we only investigate two-hadron molecular states. The possible interplay of scales in meson containing three hadrons is discussed in Ref. [782] on the example for the Y(4660).",

            "text": "The leading-order piece of the HQET Lagrangian shown in Eq. 54is independent of the heavy-quark flavor. This is at the origin of the heavy-quark flavor symmetry, which is routinely employed to relate features from the c-quark sector to the b-quark sector, as long as there is only a single heavy quark involved. However, when it comes to doubly-heavy systems the flavor symmetry is no more a symmetry of the leading-order Lagrangian, since both the potential and the kinetic energy of the heavy particle are of the same order. See the discussion at the end of Sec. 4.4.2 for NRQCD, but the same reasoning applies to pNRQCD. It should be remarked, however, that, differently from (p)NRQCD, where the potential seen by the two heavy quarks is known at short distances and may be computed in perturbation theory, in the hadronic EFT this is not the case: The short distance interaction always contains counter terms at leading order. Hence, if one wants to construct an EFT that connects the c-quark with the b-quark sector, the scaling of these counter terms with the hadron mass, M, must be either derived or imposed. Clearly, different assumptions lead to different results: In Refs. [110,783] the binding energy of the heavier systems is found larger than that of the lighter systems; the opposite is the case in Ref. [778], reflecting the fact that the former work assumes that the scattering potential of the two heavy-meson system is independent of the heavy meson-mass M, whereas the latter derives a 1/M scaling based on a renormalisation group argument. The role of the heavy flavor symmetry in the hadronic EFT was first studied systematically in Ref. [112], with the conclusion that no common effective field theory can be defined for bottomed and charmed molecular systems simultaneously, since the heavy meson mass cannot be removed consistently from the formalism. As we have remarked, this is the same situation that we face in (p)NRQCD for bottomonia and charmonia. On the other hand, as in case of (p)NRQCD, the heavy-particle spin symmetry holds at leading order also in any EFT for two-hadron systems.",

It may either be formulated based on a four-dimensional formalism or a threedimensional formalism related to time-ordered perturbation theory (for a comparison of the two schemes we refer to Appendix E of Ref. [784]). For example, in the former scheme the integral measure counts as v 5  off each other 20 ) or a momentum-independent counter term as v L , where L denotes the partial wave. In the latter case, the integral measure counts as v 3 and a time slice that cuts only heavy mesons counts as 1/v 2 . Pion exchange and contact terms are counted as in the four-dimensional formalism the same way. Accordingly, a meson bubble scales as v (2L+1) in both schemes. This shows that loops are most important for S -waves (L = 0), however, there is no parametric enhancement of the loops calling for their resummation (This statement is not in conflict with the observation made at the beginning of this section, namely that two-hadron reducible diagrams are parametrically enhanced compared to the irreducible ones). This is completely analogous to the situation in the two-nucleon system and we refer to Ref. [611] for a detailed discussion. What is generally done to arrive at a formalism where the heavy meson loops are resummed to all orders is to argue that the coupling constants that multiply each loop are sufficiently large to call for this or to simply impose it, since a resummation is necessary to generate bound states (see, e.g., Refs. [775,776,779]), The same construction can also be applied to decays. Since for a molecular state its coupling to the moleculeforming channel is large, two-hadron loops always appear at leading order. However, whether a given decay is sensitive to the long-range part of the wave function, which contains the information on the molecular component, as explained in Sec. 4.3.4, depends on the quantum numbers involved. As an example, we present here the reasoning of Ref. [785] where the decays of the Z b states were investigated from an effective field theory point of view based on the non relativistic effective field theory introduced in Refs. [786,787]. The relevant diagrams that appear at leading order as well as some subleading diagrams are displayed in Fig. 94.",

Thus we may conclude that the effective field theory described here allows one to calculate the decays of the Z b states to \u03b3\u03c7 bJ and \u03c0h bJ in a controlled way (with a 10% uncertainty in the amplitude); these transitions are dominated by the light degrees of freedom and are, therefore, sensitive to the molecular component of the Z b states. The same reasoning allows one to show that under certain conditions heavy meson loops can provide very prominent contributions in the transitions of regular heavy quarkonia [787,791,792]. In contrast to this, the decays to the \u03c0\u03a5 final states acquire short-range contributions already at leading order. In this case, it is not possible to make quantitative predictions for the transitions within the molecular picture. An analogous reasoning allows one to conclude that the transitions X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 and X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S ) are sensitive to the short-range part of the X wave function and may not be used to draw conclusions on the molecular nature of the X(3872) [85] -contrary to the claims of Refs. [83] where a particular model was employed to estimate the rates. In Ref. [300] the line shapes of the Z b states are studied within the effective field theory formalism sketched above. At the first stage, only the naive leading order diagrams were considered: Momentum independent counter terms as well as the one pion exchange. Note that, since the pion exchange with its sizeable tensor force can connect S -to D-waves, the basis needs to be enlarged compared to the inclusion of only S -waves commonly kept when studying heavy meson molecules. The typical momentum in the B * B channel for the energies near the B * B * threshold is",

In a properly renormalised EFT the contact terms should be capable of absorbing the cut-off dependence.

On the contrary, as soon as one pion exchange is included in the calculation, these additional terms provide a perturbative correction only.  The pole locations and residues that emerge from the described study of the Z b states, as well as their spin partners W bJ , are presented in Tab. 14 for a potential with contact terms only and in Tab. 15 for the fully renormalised potential including one pion exchange [571] -note that for the W bJ states partial waves up to G-waves need to be included in order to render the potential consistent with the heavy quark spin symmetry [573]. In all cases, to reduce the complexity of the problem when extracting the poles and residues, the inelastic channels are lumped into a single effective channel. The sign convention of the energies is such that negative (positive) energies refer to below (above) threshold poles. Moreover, a negative (positive) imaginary part of a pole-momentum for a given channel refers to the unphysical (physical) sheet. Thus, in all cases the poles extracted from the analysis appear on the unphysical sheet very close to the threshold and the data are consistent with only a single near-threshold pole in line with a molecular interpretation for the states. Since all poles are on the unphysical sheets, the Weinberg criterion to measure the molecular admixture cannot be applied to the residues provided in the tables. However, we may still use Eq. (45) to estimate the order of magnitude of the residues one would expect for molecular states in the BB system bound by, say, 1 MeV only.

One feature, however, is special: When the pion exchange is included some states appear as above-threshold poles with a small imaginary part. This was commonly believed to be a signature for compact states, however, the proximity of the left-hand singularity from the pion exchange, which introduces an additional small scale, seems to be responsible for this finding. Here more research appears to be necessary -especially since all poles but that of the W b2 move below threshold in the formalism without one pion exchange and the latter pole moves below threshold as well as soon as the inelastic channels are switched off.",

            "text": "The effective field theory outlined in the chapter is based on the most general Lagrangian compatible with the QCD symmetries. As such, a priori it does not involve any assumption about the nature of the states that emerge once the dynamical equations are solved. However, an assumption enters as soon as the power counting is employed. As argued in the beginning of this section, the scheme is built on the assumption that the two-hadron relative momentum is the smallest scale of the problem. Then ladder diagrams are enhanced and a potential picture is justified. According to Weinberg's criterion we call states that emerge from the presence of the two-hadron cut hadronic molecules (see the discussion in Sec. 4.3.4). If there were an s-channel pole in the system (that could be generated from a nearby tetraquark state, for example), it would appear as a pole of the kind 1/(s \u2212 s 0 ). Employing a momentum/energy expansion of the counter terms means that those pole terms are effectively expanded in s/s 0 . Thus, the effective field theory would signal a close by bare pole by a nonconvergence of the expansion of the contact terms. The analysis of, e.g., the Z b states presented in Ref. [300] shows that the currently existing data are consistent with the assumed power counting as soon as a properly renormalised one pion exchange is included in the formalism. It is therefore fair to say that the data are consistent with a molecular nature of the states. However, once the one pion exchange is omitted from the study, the expansion of contact terms seems to converge badly. Better data are necessary in order to allow one to draw more sound conclusions from the Z b line shapes. In particular, data for the line shapes of the spin partner states would be extremely valuable. Theoretical predictions for these observables within the hadronic effective field theory outlined in this section are provided in Ref. [571].",

For a detailed discussion we refer to Refs. [342,531,794,795]. These logarithmic singularities can play an important role, whenever all intermediate states in the triangle can go (near) on-shell simultaneously and additional kinematic conditions are met. It should be stressed, however, that in many cases the inverse of the average velocity (see above) is a good approximation to the triangle diagram [531]. Triangle singularities might play an important role in different decays of vector mesons [341,342,796], and might explain the signal of the Z c (4430) [595,797,798] or the narrow pentaquark signal [799,800]. In this context it is important to observe that the triangle singularities appear only under very special kinematic conditions. In particular, if a state is seen, e.g., from very different initial states or energies, one can assume that the triangle singularities are not operative for all of them. Moreover, when studying a three-body final state containing a particle pair that emerged from an elastic rescattering form a particle pair in the triangle, no logarithmic singularity can be present according to Schmid's theorem [801,802] -in other words: Even when a triangle singularity is responsible for a structure that was interpreted as a resonance in some inelastic channels, in the corresponding elastic channel there should not be any signal. On the other hand: If there were a pole present it should naturally show up in all channels to which it can couple according to the selection rules. This feature can clearly be tested experimentally.",

The theory is discretised onto a four-dimensional spacetime lattice, a grid of points, of finite volume and quantities of interest are extracted from Euclidean (imaginary-time) correlation functions which are computed numerically using Monte-Carlo methods. For spectroscopy, the energy eigenstates of QCD in a finite volume follow from computations of two-point correlation functions, O i (t) O \u2020 j (0) , where O i (t) is an interpolating operator at discrete time t with appropriate quantum numbers. The effect of working on a discrete lattice can be accounted for by performing calculations with a number of different lattice spacings and extrapolating to the continuum limit and, similarly, the effect of working in a finite volume can be taken into account by performing calculations with a number of different lattice volumes. Historically, calculations with light (up and down) quarks having their physical mass were too computationally expensive -unphysically-heavy light quarks were used, giving an unphysically-large \u03c0 mass, M \u03c0 , and a 'chiral' extrapolation to physical M \u03c0 was performed. More recently, it has become feasible to calculate some quantities using physical-mass, or very close to physical-mass, light quarks.",

In particular, the various charmonium and bottomonium-like X, Y, Z states that are the subjects of this report are resonances or have masses very close to threshold. These phenomena are more challenging to study in lattice QCD because it is not possible to compute scattering amplitudes or the properties of resonances directly from finite-volume Euclidean correlation functions -asymptotic states can not be defined in finite volume and, in contrast to an infinite volume, the spectrum above threshold is discrete with allowed momenta quantised by the boundary conditions.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, infinite-volume scattering amplitudes can be determined indirectly from a relation between them and the discrete spectrum of finite-volume energy eigenstates. For elastic scattering, each energy level, E cm , gives the scattering phase shift at that energy, \u03b4(E cm ). When more than one scattering channel or partial wave is relevant, each energy provides a constraint on the scattering amplitudes at that energy. Once the scattering amplitudes have been determined, analytically continuing to complex E cm , their singularity content can be investigated and so the resonance and bound-state content inferred (including the mass and width of any resonance and its coupling to various hadronhadron channels). This method was originally introduced by L\u00fcscher, Refs. [830][831][832][833], and has subsequently been generalised by many others -it is now applicable to hadron-hadron scattering with arbitrary spin, arbitrary overall momentum with respect to the lattice, and with any number of coupled two-hadron scattering channels, Refs. . Work is advancing to extend the approach to channels with three or more hadrons, see Refs. [858][859][860][861][862][863][864][865][866][867][868][869][870][871][872][873][874][875][876][877]. A related approach for connecting finite-volume lattice QCD calculations to infinite-volume scattering amplitudes, based on the same underlying ideas, is to consider an effective Hamiltonian describing hadron-hadron interactions in a finite volume, such as unitarised chiral perturbation theory, see e.g. Refs. [843,844,848,[878][879][880][881][882][883][884][885]. Other approaches include using an optical potential, Ref. [886], the histogram method in which a probability distribution connected to the cross section is computed, Refs. [887,888], and a method, advocated by HAL QCD, where a non-relativistic hadron-hadron potential is computed from the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction, Refs. [889][890][891][892][893][894][895][896][897][898][899][900][901]. Ref. [902] provides a more detailed review of the \"L\u00fcscher method\" and applications, and discusses some of the other approaches.",

The reduced symmetry of the spatial lattice volume, usually a cubic or rectangular box, compared to the infinite-volume continuum, means that partial waves of different J can 'mix' and appear in the same spectrum -sufficient energies must be extracted across a number of different quantum-number channels in order to disentangle them. Achieving the required constraint generally necessitates the computation of many energies in a number of lattice volumes, for systems moving with respect to the lattice, and/or using \"twisted boundary conditions\" on the quark fields -these all modify the quantisation of momentum and so provide additional E cm , which give extra constraints. Furthermore, this approach neglects corrections that are exponentially suppressed in the spatial extent L, \u223c e \u2212M \u03c0 L , and so requires a large enough volume, LM \u03c0 1, for these to be negligible. In recent years, computational power and algorithms have advanced sufficiently to allow applications of this method to meaningfull computations of hadron-hadron scattering. However, it must be kept in mind that, unlike the lattice QCD studies of stable hadrons mentioned above, these investigations do not generally have quantitative control over all the systematic uncertainties (for example, those arising from working at a finite lattice spacing or with unphysically-heavy light quarks).",

Currently, calculations are mostly limited to extracting finite-volume spectra and looking for the presence of extra levels, and they have generally been exploratory or inconclusive. More detailed computations are needed that extract a larger number of finite-volume energy levels and allow scattering amplitudes to be determined and hence the state content to be investigated robustly. All the following calculations neglect contributions where a charm quark and a charm antiquark annihilate -these are OZI suppressed and so expected to be small (see also Ref. [922]). In the NRQCD language of Sec. 4.4.2, quark-antiquark annihilation is described by four-fermion operators in the Lagrangian density, Eq. (62). These operators are of dimension 6 or higher, and they are therefore suppressed by powers of the quark mass in the power counting of the effective field theory.",

These are related to Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and in turn to non-relativistic potentials which are used in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, see Refs. [889][890][891][892][893][894][895][896][897][898][899][900][901]. There has been a lot of discussion as to the reliability of the HAL QCD approach and how it is employed. There is yet to be a successful demonstration of its application to the \u03c1 resonance in I = 1 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. For a number of baryon-baryon channels, there appears to be a discrepancy between results obtained using this method and results obtain using the L\u00fcscher approach, though investigations using the latter method have their own limitations -see Refs. [898-900, 902, 936] and references therein. In Ref. [937] the HAL QCD potentials for baryon-baryon scattering are critically examined phenomenologically. It is found that especially in the \u2126N and \u2126\u2126 channels, where one pion change is not forbidden in the scattering potential, the range of the potential reported by the HAL QCD studies is at odds with phenomenological expectations.",

[177] performed a quenched calculation of radiative transition ampltidues involving some excited, high spin and exotic charmonia, neglecting the unstable nature of states above threshold. One highlight was the radiative decay of an exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ hybrid meson, \u03b7 c1 , which was found to have a significant partial width, \u0393(\u03b7 c1 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3) \u223c 100 keV, supporting suggestions from models that the photocouplings between 1 \u2212+ hybrids and conventional mesons should be large. A large decay amplitude for the decay of a 1 \u2212\u2212 hybrid to \u03b7 c was found, again in line with phenomenological expectations. In addition, it was shown how the pattern of different multipole amplitudes in the radiative decay of 2 ++ charmonia to J/\u03c8 can distinguish P wave and F wave tensor mesons. As well as studying the \u03c7 c2 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 transition, Ref. [941] performed a quenched calculation of the \u03b7 c2 (2 \u2212 +) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 transition amplitudes, finding a small partial width and determining the three multipole amplitudes. These investigations demonstrate the feasibility of using lattice QCD to study transitions involving higher-lying charmonia and that such calculations can provide phenomenologically-interesting results -calculations with dynamical quarks allowing for the unstable nature of resonances are warranted.",

This report contains a description of all exotic candidates that have been observed up to the current date. On the theory side, only lattice QCD has the potential to perform full self-consistent calculations from first principles. Currently, however, lattice QCD calculations of exotics adopt approximations and have unquantified systematic uncertainties that reduce their reliability. Moreover, not all observables are currently accessible in lattice QCD calculations. For these reasons, also other methods are employed to describe exotics. Effective field theories allow to perform calculations of exotic states with a clear connection to QCD. They are limited by their specific ranges of applicability, and need to be supplemented by data or lattice QCD results. Nevertheless, they are systematically improvable and progress is steady. In addition to these systematic approaches there are various phenomenological models investigating different aspects of exotic states. While uncertainty estimates for their results are difficult if not impossible, phenomenological models can still provide valuable insights, in particular where other methods have not been applied yet. In the report, we have presented in some detail these different theoretical approaches.",

With a collimator suppressing the incoherent bremsstrahlung spectrum, a linear polarization of 40% is achieved in the coherent peak at 9 GeV. The scattered electrons are used to tag the energy of the photon beam. The main detector, shown in Fig. 100, consists of a 2 T solenoid magnet with the central and forward drift chamber for charged particles, a lead/scintillating fiber barrel calorimeter and lead-glass forward calorimeter for neutral particles and electron detection, and a start counter and forward TOF wall for precision timing measurements.

Pions are reconstructed for momenta down to 100 MeV and protons to 300 MeV with a resolution from 1% to 3%. The GlueX detector has been successfully commissioned and started its physics data taking in spring 2017.

(2) Due to low track multiplicities and detector occupancy, the reconstruction efficiency of B\u2212/D\u2212mesons is high and the trigger bias is very low. 3Since the initial state is known, \"missing mass\" analyses can be performed to infer the existence of new particles via energy/momentum conservation rather than demanding full reconstruction of their final states. This gives the opportunity to measure the absolute branching fractions of the XYZ states. (4) Overcoming the statistical limitations of previous experiments, Belle II will be in a unique position to perform, for example, searches for resonant states via ISR processes, studies of quarkoniumlike spectroscopy via bottomonium decays and bottomonium-like spectroscopy via hadronic and radiative transitions among bottomonia, and studies of QCD bound states like the deuteron and di-baryons.",

The proposed improved EMC is crucial for the feasibility of such a measurement in a high-luminosity environment. 2The neutral pentaquark candidates can be searched for in the \u039b + c D \u2212 system in the process \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c D \u2212K * 0 . Such process suffers from the low detection efficiency and the small branching fractions of \u039b + c and D \u2212 decays. Such channel needs very large data sets to compensate the low efficiency and small product branching fraction. 3The pentaquark states with strangeness can be searched for in the \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bK \u2212 process, which has been seen at LHCb using Run 1 data [964]. About 300 signal events were observed, thus no intermediate states were investigated. An increase of the integrated luminosity by a factor of 100 would allow detailed amplitude analyses with a similar sensitivity as in the pentaquark discovery channel.",

This allows for the precise determination of some parameters for some XYZ states, for example the natural width and line-shape measurements of very narrow resonances. Recently PANDA used the X(3872) as an example to study the achievable sensitivities of measuring its width, since an absolute width measurement is the key to understand the nature of the X(3872) and distinguish between the various theoretical models. For such a narrow state with J PC = 1 ++ , the PANDA experiment has a good ability to perform precise energy scans of the resonance regions. Based on a comprehensive MC simulation study, the achievable sensitivities of measuring X(3872) width are achieved by assuming 40 energy scan points and data-taking time period of two days per point [966]. The outcome of the sensitivity study is very promising. For example, with an assumption of the BW shape of the X(3872) and an input signal cross section of \u03c3(pp \u2192 X(3872)) = 50 nb, a 3\u03c3 precision on the measured X(3872) width (\u0393 mesa ), \u2206\u0393 mesa /\u0393 mesa better than 33%, is achieved for an assumed natural decay width larger than about \u0393 0 = 40, 80, and 110 keV for HR, HL, and P1 running modes, respectively.",

As emphasized in Sec. 4.2, the main virtue of the quark model is that it allows a first classification of states and the computation of some observables by means of a simple theoretical apparatus. The quark model has turned out to be quite useful in identifying possible exotic states close to or above open heavy-flavor thresholds, where more rigorous alternatives are often absent. The very notion \"exotic\" is based on the observation of whether or not the studied resonance fits into the quark-model scheme. It is natural to expect that the quark model will continue to play a role in the identification of ordinary quarkonium states and, climbing up in the spectra, of the XYZ states. For the identification of states, such as the XYZ, close to or above open-flavor thresholds, its most important evolution should consist of incorporating more and more realistically the effects due to the coupling of the heavy quark-antiquark pair with hadron pairs. The inclusion of these effects goes under the generic name of unquenching the quark model. Unquenching the quark model is not without difficulties. The reason is that the results are extremely sensitive to the details of the particular model framework and to the values of the parameters used therein. Indeed, even small changes in the parameters may result in a sizeable shift in the nodes of the wave functions of the mesons involved and, therefore, their overlap. This, in turn, may result in sizeable changes of the mass shifts and decay widths of the hadrons under study. Besides this, as was stressed in Sec. 4.3, a proper inclusion of strong thresholds does not reduce to just a modification of the quark-model potential, but requires also an extension of the Fock space to multiparticle components and coupled channels. Multiparticle components include hybrids, hadroquarkonia, tetraquarks, hadronic molecules, and others.",

This is more so for the constituent gluon than it is in general for the quark model, as gluons are exactly massless in the QCD Lagrangian due to the gauge symmetry. Hence, although it is reasonable to expect that the quark model with constituent gluons will continue to serve as a reference in identifying hybrid state candidates, it will not, by its own definition, be improvable in a significant way. Even for what concerns the classification of states, we have seen that the degeneracy patterns of higher multiplets may be different in other approaches.",

Phenomenological approaches have been presented in Sec. 4.3.4. The form of the phenomenological potentials is typically deduced from various meson exchanges. Although such models are rather attractive, since the potentials allow for a straightforward interpretation, they have serious shortcomings. To begin with, the potentials constructed and used in these models need regularisation at short distances, which calls for additional modelling. This results in significant differences from work to work, thus giving rise to different, sometimes controversial, predictions. Also, quantum-mechanical calculations employing a static potential inevitably ignore multiparticle unitarity, which might play an important, sometimes crucial, role in some systems.",

As a result, even in cases where phenomenological models catch the main physical features of the system under study, they are not improvable in a systematic fashion. This is why crucial progress may be expected if phenomenological approaches get embedded in or substituted by suitable effective field theories of QCD. The ones relevant for the XYZ states have been extensively presented in Sec. 4.4. Effective field theories provide proper definitions of the potentials, couplings, low-energy constants and matrix elements describing the systems of interest. They are supposed to include in their description all relevant degrees of freedom, and are equipped by a power counting that allows, on one hand, to assess the accuracy of each prediction and, on the other one, to systematically improve it.",

Potentials can be computed at short distances in perturbative QCD, and we have documented the progress made in this direction in the last years allowing computations with (almost) N 3 LL accuracy. At large distances the effective string theory provides valuable analytical tools. Nevertheless, the most straightforward way to compute the potentials from QCD is numerically via lattice QCD. Despite many decades of work, still several improvements and even first-time calculations are possible in this direction. The precision of the already computed potentials (spin-and momentum-dependent ones) should be improved, as some of them do not match properly with short-distance expectations. Further, they should be computed (ideally) in 2+1+1 flavor lattice simulations. For the time being only the static potential is available on dynamical lattices. Finally, some potentials should be computed for the first time, in particular the 1/m 2 h spin-and momentumindependent ones, where m h is the heavy-quark mass.

To be fully predictive, this EFT requires input from lattice QCD. Hybrid potentials have been computed, also recently, but in the pure gauge theory. Full QCD lattice calculations are still missing. Even more urgent than the calculation of the dynamical hybrid potentials is the calculation of the leading spin-dependent potential and quarkonium-hybrid mixing potential. Both depend on the same 1/m h suppressed operator. Their determination would allow a consistent determination of the fine structure of the hybrid spectrum and of mixing with quarkonium states of different spin. The mixing of spin 0 (1) hybrids with spin 1 (0) quarkonium states may be crucial to identify those hybrid candidate states that have been detected in both \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c decay channels.

In both cases, a Schr\u00f6dinger or Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation is solved for a system of two hadrons connected by a potential. The differences are, however, in the choice of the potential and in the regularisation of the equations. A detailed discussion of the EFT approach for hadronic molecules and a comprehensive list of relevant references can be found in Sec. 4.4.5. Further theoretical developments of the EFT approach for molecules should include a systematic improvement in the theoretical accuracy by considering higher orders in the EFT expansion, extension to the SU(3) flavor group for light quarks and tests of the accuracy of the various approximate symmetries employed to construct the EFT potential. For example, systematic studies of the breaking patterns of the heavy-quark spin symmetry appear to be very important especially for the charm-quark sector. Moreover, since within the EFT the light-quark mass dependence is under control (see, e.g., Ref. [781]), it should be possible to provide more predictions for the pole trajectories as a function of the light-quark masses.

            "text": "One reason that progress has been slower here than in the light-meson sector is that many hadron-hadron channels become kinematically open relatively close together in energy, including those involving hadrons with non-zero spin -this leads to numerous finite-volume energy levels that must all be extracted and a number of coupled scattering amplitudes that must be constrained simultaneously. Techniques to extract coupled-channel scattering amplitudes, which have been demonstrated for light mesons, Refs. [909,[969][970][971][972][973][974], suggest that there are good prospects for progress in the near future. Another issue is the presence of three-hadron thresholds relatively low in energy. To date, no scattering amplitudes involving more than two hadrons have been extracted from lattice QCD calculations. Recent computations of finite-volume energy levels involving three hadrons and developments in the formalism for relating these to infinite-volume scattering amplitudes suggest that we can expect the first lattice determinations of these in the not-too-distant future. However, it is likely to take longer to see realistic applications in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors. These are areas where the challenges overlap with those encountered when analysing experimental data, the techniques developed there may be useful and it may be fruitful to work together with the amplitude analysis community.",

In the fit, the mass and width of the Y(4230) are fixed to the latest measured values at Belle [68]. The signal significance of the Y(4230) is found to be only 2.4\u03c3. In this fit, one obtains M[Y(4360)] = (4365 \u00b1 7 \u00b1 4) MeV, \u0393[Y(4360)] = (74 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 4) MeV, M[Y(4660)] = (4660 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 12) MeV, and \u0393[Y(4660)] = (74 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 4) MeV.

The solid curves show the best fits. The processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 + c.c. and \u03c0 + D \u2212 D * 0 + c.c. are reanalyzed using a double-tag technique with data samples at \u221a s=4.23 and 4.26 GeV [267]. The bachelor \u03c0 + and the D-meson pair are reconstructed, with the \u03c0 from D * \u2212 and D * 0 decays inferred using energy-momentum conservation. The D 0 candidates are reconstructed in four decay modes(K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), and the D \u2212 in six decay modes (K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 , K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 , K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 , and K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 ).With both D candidates reconstructed, the background level is greatly suppressed. Similarly, a structure close to the DD * mass threshold is observed in the (DD * ) \u00b1 invariant mass distributions for the two processes at \u221a s=4.23 and 4.26 GeV. A simultaneous fit with a BW function for the Z c (3900) signal and a phasespace distribution for the background to the (DD * ) \u00b1 invariant mass distributions yields a mass of (3890.3 \u00b1 0.8) MeV and a width of (31.5 \u00b1 3.3) MeV, with a statistical significance greater than 10\u03c3, where the errors are statistical only. The corresponding pole mass and width are (3881.7 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b1 1.6) MeV and (26.6 \u00b1 2.0 \u00b1 2.1) MeV, respectively. The production rates are measured to be \u03c3[e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2213 Z c (3900) \u00b1 ]B[Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 (DD * ) \u00b1 ] = (141.6 \u00b1 7.9 \u00b1 12.3) pb and (108.4 \u00b1 6.9 \u00b1 8.8) pb for \u221a s=4.23 GeV and 4.26 GeV, respectively.

The double-tag analysis only has \u223c9% events in common with the single-tag analysis, so the two analyses are almost statistically independent and can be combined into a weighted average. The combined pole mass and width are (3882.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 1.5) MeV and (26.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 2.1) MeV, respectively.

In an analysis of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 (DD * ) 0 , the Z c (3900) 0 \u2192 (DD * ) 0 is also observed[268] and all the results agree with the expectations from isospin symmetry.Determination of the spin-parity of the Z c (3900) is undoubtedly a crucial issue. In both the single-tag and doubletag analyses of Z c (3900) \u2192 DD * + c.c.[266,267], by checking the angular distribution of the \u03c0 accompanying the Z c (3900), BESIII found that the spin-parity J P = 1 + of the Z c (3900) is favored over J P = 0 \u2212 and 1 \u2212 assumptions,",

Weakly-coupled pNRQCD follows from integrating out gluons of energy or momentum m h v (sometimes called soft gluons) from NRQCD. Because at the scale m h v 2 we cannot resolve the single heavy quark and antiquark, it may be useful to cast heavy quark and antiquark fields into bilocal fields that depend on time, t, the c.m. coordinate R and the relative coordinate r. We call singlet, S, the color singlet component of the quark and antiquark field and octet, O, its color octet component, normalized as S = 1 3\u00d73 S / \u221a 3 and O = \u221a 2O a T a . The distance r typically scales like 1/(m h v), while the c.m. coordinate, R, and the time, t, typically scale like 1/(m h v 2 ), as the quark-antiquark pair may only recoil against ultrasoft gluons. To ensure that gluons are ultrasoft in the pNRQCD Lagrangian, gauge fields are multipole expanded in r. Hence gauge fields in the pNRQCD Lagrangian only depend on time and the c.m. coordinate. The matching of pNRQCD to NRQCD is schematically illustrated inFig. 85. The pNRQCD Lagrangian is organized as a double expansion in 1/m h and r. At order r in the multipole expansion and at leading order in 1/m h , the weakly-coupled pNRQCD Lagrangian density has the form[675,676] ",

For data at \u221a s =4.358 GeV, there is no obvious structure observed in the M[\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(2S )] spectrum.

The symmetry O(3)\u00d7C is made manifest in pNRQCD. Hence pNRQCD is the suitable EFT framework for studying hybrids in the short range [676]. Figure 88 shows that close to their minimum the hybrid potentials tend, indeed, to cluster into the gluelump multiplets, i.e., according to the short-distance symmetry group O(3)\u00d7C. Hence, assuming that the physical hybrid states live close to their potential minimum, the simplified Born-Oppenheimer picture of Fig. 87 has to be modified by replacing single potentials with multiplets of nearly degenerate potentials. Because of the near degeneracy, vibrational modes associated to these potentials may have a significant mixing. Different multiplets are separated by a mass gap of order \u039b QCD .",
