Quantum entanglement of neutral K meson pairs uniquely available at KLOE-2 allows to probe directly the time-reversal symmetry (T ) independently of CP violation. This is achieved by a comparison of probabilities for a transition between flavour and CP-definite states and its inverse obtained through exchange of initial and final states. As such a test requires the reconstruction of the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay accompanied by K S \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2213 \u03bd with good timing information, a new reconstruction method for this process is also presented which is capable of reconstructing the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay with decay time resolution of O(1\u03c4 S ).",

            "text": "Well known for CP-violating phenomena, neutral kaons may also be used to study directly the time-reversal symmetry although special care is necessary to prepare a T symmetry test which should be independent of CP-violation effects. Such a test is possible with entangled neutral kaon pairs uniquely available at the DA\u03a6NE \u03c6-factory [1]. Kaon transitions between flavour-definite and CP-definite states constitute processes for whom an exchange of initial and final state only corresponds to the time-reversal operation and not CP nor CPT conjugation. This allows for a direct test by comparison of amplitudes for a transition and its inverse independently of CP and CPT . A similar principle was recently used by the BaBar experiment to observe T -violation in the neutral B meson system [2,3]. In turn, KLOE-2 is capable of investigating time-reversal violation with neutral kaons.",

Meanwhile, hadronic decay modes with two and three pions (3\u03c0 0 ) 2 are only possible for CP eigenstates K + (CP=1) and K \u2212 (CP=-1), respectively. Observation of a transition between CP and flavour-definite states also requires identification of kaon state at a point before its decay. This is uniquely possible with entangled neutral kaon pairs, as recognition of the state of the first decaying kaon guarantees its still-living partner to be in the orthogonal state at the moment of the first decay. Therefore it is possible to obtain the transitions listed in table 1 along with their time inverses. It is worth stressing that these transitions are connected with their T -inverses only by timereversal conjugation and not by CP nor CPT transformations. For each of ",

For construction of time-depedent decay distributions, kaon proper decay times should be determined with resolution of the order of 1 \u03c4 S . In case of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (chosen as the \u03c0\u03c0 state) and semileptonic final states, charged particle tracks provide good vertexing (and thus timing) information. The K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2192 6\u03b3 decay, however, is a challenging reconstruction task as only neutral particles are involved and the only recorded information on this process are the \u03b3 hits in the EMC. For this decay a new reconstruction method was prepared for KLOE-2. The new reconstruction procedure uses only information on up to 6 \u03b3 hits in the KLOE-2 EMC in order to reconstruct both spatial location and time of the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2192 6\u03b3 decay. For each of the photons, EMC provides information on the hit point and time (Fig. 2, left). Therefore a set of possible origin points of the incident \u03b3 is a sphere centered at the EMC hit position with a radius dependent on the time of the K L decay t. Such spheres for each available EMC \u03b3 hit constitute a system of equations:",

Performance of reconstruction was tested on a sample of MC-generated K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 events. Resolution of proper K L decay time was estimated for several regions of the decay vertex distance from the interaction point. Fig. 3 shows the resulting resolution which is at the level of \u223c 2 \u03c4 S and remains constant with increasing K L travelled path lengths in the whole range available in the detector.
