This observable has been measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, providing a new probe to measure quenching. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks using anti-kt with R = 0.4 and low IR cutoff of jet constituents (p T,track > 0.15 GeV/c). The complex uncorrelated jet background is corrected by a data-driven approach. Recoil jet distributions are reported for 15 < p ch T,jet < 50 GeV/c. Events are classified by signal in the ALICE V0A detector, which measures forward multiplicity, and ZNA, which measures the number of neutrons at zero degrees. This self-normalized observable does not require scaling of reference distributions by TpA , thereby avoiding the need for geometric modeling. We compare the trigger-normalized recoil jet yield for p-Pb collisions with different event activity to measure the effects of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC.",

            "text": "Using semi-inclusive hadron+jet correlations, the ALICE Collaboration assessed that in central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, charged jets lose energy of about (8 \u00b1 2) GeV/c in a form of charged particles which are radiated outside of a resolution parameter R = 0.5 cone [3]. The corresponding parton energy loss in a p-Pb collision is, however, expected to be much smaller than that in Pb-Pb. First, the average distance traversed by a parton through the hot medium created in a p-Pb collision will be shorter than in Pb-Pb collisions. Second, the energy density achieved in p-Pb will be lower. According to [4], energy density affects the magnitude of the transport parameterq which appears in the BDMPS formula [5] for medium-induced parton energy loss. In p-Pb,q should be about seven times smaller than in Pb-Pb [4]. Experimental searches for medium-induced modification of inclusive jet production in small systems were carried out by PHENIX at RHIC [6] and ATLAS [7] and ALICE [8,9] at the LHC. Observed events were classified according to measured event activity (EA), i.e., particle arXiv:1706.07612v1 [hep-ex] 23 Jun 2017 multiplicity or total energy detected in a forward detector which is assumed to be correlated with collision geometry. PHENIX has shown that inclusive jet production is not suppressed in minimum bias d-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV. However, for events selected by the measured EA, jet production is suppressed for large EA (assumed to be \"central\" d-Au collisions) and enhanced for small EA (assumed to be \"peripheral\"). ATLAS reported similar modification of inclusive jet production as a function of EA for jets measured in p-going direction in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. It is however challenging to directly correlate measured EA with collision geometry in small systems, as various conservation laws and fluctuations play an important role and induce bias in the geometric modeling [10,11]. This bias can be avoided by constructing observables which allow to identify medium-induced effects without the need to know the relation between EA and collision geometry. This analysis utilizes such an observable, based on the coincidence measurements of a high-p T semi-inclusive hadron and recoiling jets [3].",

Events were selected online by a Minimum Bias (MB) trigger, consisting of the coincidence of signals in the V0A and V0C forward scintillator arrays. The offline event selection rejected events with multiple primary vertices (pile-up events), and constrained the primary vertex position along the beam axis to |v z | < 10 cm. After all event selection cuts, the number of events in the analysis is 96 \u00d7 10 6 . EA classification is based upon signals from V0A, with a pseudorapidity acceptance of 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1, and ZNA, a neutron calorimeter at zero degrees relative to the beam direction, at a distance 112.5 m from the vertex diamond [11].

The fully corrected \u2206 recoil distributions for different EA selections are shown in the right panel in Fig. 1. The main source of systematic uncertainty is the track reconstruction efficiency, resulting in 4-10 % uncertainty on the spectra. Other sources of uncertainty are unfolding, choice of c Ref , \u03c1 estimator, track momentum smearing etc. They are typically below 4 %. The cumulative systematic uncertainty is the quadratic sum of all contributions.",

            "text": "Jet quenching may result in transport of jet energy out of the jet cone, which would suppress \u2206 recoil at fixed p ch T,jet . If jet quenching is more likely to occur in events with greater EA, the \u2206 recoil spectrum ratios shown in Fig. 2 will be suppressed below unity. However, the ratio is consistent with unity at all p ch T,jet within the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty in all panels, indicating negligible jet quenching effects relative to the uncertainties. These data can nevertheless provide a limit on the magnitude of medium-induced energy transport to large angles. For this estimate, we assume that the average magnitude of energy transported out-of-cone is independent of p ch T,jet . We parameterize the 50-100 % and 0-20 % \u2206 recoil distributions with the exponential functions \u2206 recoil | 50\u2212100% = a exp \u2212p ch T,jet /b and \u2206 recoil | 0\u221220% = a exp \u2212 p ch T,jet +s /b , with common fit parameters a and b. The ratios in   [3]. The measurement ofs also provides a limit on out-of-cone energy transport due to jet quenching in p-Pb collisions. Under the assumption that its magnitude is independent of p ch T,jet , the medium-induced out-of-cone energy transport for events with high relative to low EA is less than 0.7 GeV/c, at 90% confidence, for jets with R = 0.4 and 15 < p ch T,jet < 50 GeV/c.
