            "text": "A significant fraction of the total inelastic proton-proton cross section at high energies is attributed to diffractive processes, characterized by the presence of a large rapidity region \u00c1y with no hadrons, usually called ''rapidity gap'' [rapidity is defined as y \u00bc \u00f01=2\u00de ln\u00bd\u00f0E \u00fe p Z \u00de=\u00f0E \u00c0 p Z \u00de, where E and p Z are the energy and longitudinal momentum of the final-state particle, respectively]. Diffractive scattering is described in the framework of Regge theory as mediated by a strongly interacting color-singlet exchange with the vacuum quantum numbers, the so-called ''pomeron trajectory'' [1]. Diffractive events with a hard parton-parton scattering are especially interesting because they can be studied in terms of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). In diffractive events the proton emitting the pomeron either remains intact, losing only a few percent of its momentum, or is found in a low mass excited state. In addition, since the vacuum quantum numbers are exchanged, no particles are produced in a large rapidity range adjacent to the scattered proton (or its dissociation products).",

            "text": "Diffraction with a hard scale has been studied in protonantiproton (p\" p) and electron-proton (ep) collisions at CERN [2], Fermilab [3][4][5][6], and DESY [7][8][9][10]. Such hard diffractive processes can be described in terms of the convolution of diffractive parton distribution functions (dPDFs) and hard scattering cross sections, which are calculable in pQCD. In this approach, the pomeron is treated as a color-singlet combination of partons with the vacuum quantum numbers. The dPDFs have been determined by the HERA experiments [7,9] by means of QCD fits to inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering data, and have been successfully used to describe different hard diffractive processes in ep collisions. This success is based on the factorization theorem for diffractive electron-proton interactions, and on the validity of the QCD evolution equations for the dPDFs [11][12][13]. However, in hard diffractive hadron-hadron collisions factorization does not hold because of soft scatterings between the spectator partons, leading to the suppression of the observed diffractive cross section. The suppression is quantified by the socalled ''rapidity gap survival probability'' [14], which is a nonperturbative quantity with large theoretical uncertainties [15][16][17][18]. It was measured to be about 10% in diffractive dijet production in p\" p collisions at the Tevatron [5].",

The tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range jnj < 2:4. ECAL and HCAL provide coverage in pseudorapidity up to jnj < 3 in the barrel region and two endcap regions.

In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry. The forward part of the hadron calorimeter, HF, consists of steel absorbers and embedded radiation-hard quartz fibers, which provide a fast collection of Cherenkov light. The pseudorapidity coverage of the HF is 2:9 < jj < 5:2. In the current analysis only the range 3:0 < jj < 4:9 was used, thus restricting the data to a region of well-understood reconstruction efficiency. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 s. The High Level Trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 300 Hz, before data storage.",

In the forward region, 3:0 < jj < 4:9, particularly relevant for this analysis, PF candidates were selected with energy greater than 4 GeV. A constant scale factor C \u00bc 1:45 AE 0:04, determined from the MC simulation by comparing the generated and reconstructed values of AE , is applied to the measured AE . The error on the correction factor C is estimated by changing the MC models used to evaluate it. The value of C reflects the fact that not all finalstate particles are detected because of the limited acceptance and imperfect response of the detector. It also takes into account the inefficiency of PF object reconstruction. In practice, C acts as a scale calibration for AE ; it depends only slightly on the value of AE and on the MC generator used. This dependence, of the order of a few percent, is included in the systematic uncertainty. The resolution of AE , in the region of the present measurement, is $25%, and practically independent of AE .",

The PYTHIA8 generator can simulate inclusive, nondiffractive as well as diffractive dijet events; separate samples were produced for the two processes. The modeling of diffractive events in these generators is based on the Ingelman and Schlein approach [31], which considers the diffractive reaction as a two-step process: one proton emits a pomeron with fractional momentum and then the pomeron interacts with the other proton. All three diffractive generators were used with dPDFs from the same fit to diffractive deep inelastic scattering data (H1 fit B [7]). The parametrization of the pomeron flux in POMPYT and POMWIG is also based on the QCD fits to the HERA data [7], while it is different in PYTHIA8 [32]. This leads to different predictions for the diffractive cross sections calculated by PYTHIA8 and POMPYT or POMWIG (notably in their normalization).

Here again, the shape of the distribution can be described by the combination of diffractive and nondiffractive MC models. The best combination was obtained by minimizing the difference between the distributions of the data and of the sum of nondiffractive and diffractive models. The relative contribution of diffractive dijet production and the overall normalization of the sum were found in this fit, and the diffractive contribution was scaled accordingly. The overall normalization of the fit result is not relevant. The effect of the calorimeter energy scale uncertainty, estimated by varying by AE10% the energy of all PF objects not associated with the leading jets, is shown by the band. The solid line in Fig. 6(a) indicates the result of the fit, according to which the diffractive dijet cross section predicted by POMPYT should be multiplied by a factor ' 0:23 to match the data. The uncertainty of this correction factor was estimated by changing the fitting procedure and was found to be $20%. Figure 6(b) presents the same data compared to PYTHIA6 D6T \u00fe POMPYT; here the fit requires the POMPYT normalization to be scaled by a factor of ' 0:17. Figure 6(c) compares the data to PYTHIA8 tune 1; both the single-diffractive and the double-diffractive components are added to the nondiffractive part, all simulated by PYTHIA8. The result of the fit is very different from that for POMWIG and PYTHIA6: the normalization of the diffractive components of PYTHIA8 needs to be multiplied by a factor ' 2:5 to match the data. This large difference is a consequence of the different implementation of the pomeron flux in PYTHIA8 and POMPYT.",

            "text": "The following conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 8: (i) The generators PYTHIA6 Z2 and PYTHIA8 tune 1, without hard diffraction, cannot by themselves describe the low-data, especially in the first bin, 0:0003 < < 0:002. (ii) It was noted already in Sec. VA that the contribution of SD MC models, e.g. POMWIG and POMPYT, is needed to describe the low-data, reflecting the presence of hard diffractive events in this region. However, these MC models predict more events than are observed, by a factor of about 5 in the lowest bin. (iii) The ratio of the measured cross section to that expected from the POMPYT and POMWIG simulations is 0:21 AE 0:07 in the first bin, where the nondiffractive contribution is small. This ratio can be taken as an upper limit of the rapidity gap survival probability (not simulated by the event generators considered). This is an upper limit because the measured cross section includes a contribution from proton-dissociative events in which the scattered proton is excited into a low mass state, which escapes undetected in the forward region; the dPDFs also include a proton-dissociative contribution. If the amount of proton-dissociative events in the data is assumed to be 41%, as estimated at particle level with PYTHIA8, and that in the dPDFs is taken to be 23% [7], then this upper limit can be turned into an estimate of the rapidity gap survival probability of 0:12 AE 0:05. (iv) POMPYT and POMWIG are LO MC generators. If POWHEG is used to predict the diffractive cross section at NLO in the first bin and PYTHIA8 tune 1 is used for hadronization, the ratio between data and predictions becomes 0:14 AE 0:05. With the assumptions just discussed on the protondissociative contribution, the rapidity gap survival probability becomes 0:08 AE 0:04. (v) Figure 8 also shows that the normalization of the SD \u00fe DD PYTHIA8 prediction disagrees with that of POMPYT and POMWIG, and would have to be scaled up by a factor of about 2 to match the data. This is a consequence of the different modeling of diffraction in these generators: while they all use the same H1 dPDFs, the parametrization of the pomeron flux in PYTHIA8 is different-and, notably, not the one used in the H1 fit. Because of this, PYTHIA8 (version 8.135) cannot be used to extract the rapidity gap survival probability. While the rapidity gap survival probability measured at the Tevatron [5,6] is close to that found in the present analysis, the two measurements cannot be directly compared because of the different kinematic regions they cover: 0:035 < < 0:095 for the CDF data and 0:0003 < < 0:002 for the present CMS data. This difference is TABLE II. Contributions to the systematic uncertainty on the dijet cross section in the three lowest bins considered. The total systematic uncertainty calculated as the quadratic sum of the individual contributions is given in the last row. Uncertainty source 0:0003 < < 0:002 0:002 < < 0:0045 0:0045 < < 0:01",

The results are compared to diffractive (POMPYT, POMWIG, and PYTHIA8 SD \u00fe DD) and nondiffractive (PYTHIA6 Z2, D6T, and PYTHIA8 tune 1) MC models. The low-data show a significant contribution from diffractive dijet production, observed for the first time at the LHC. The associated rapidity gap survival probability is estimated. Leading-order diffractive generators (POMPYT and POMWIG), based on dPDFs from the HERA experiments, overestimate the measured cross section and their normalization needs to be scaled down by a factor of $5. This factor can be interpreted as the effect of the rapidity gap survival probability. The results are also compared with NLO predictions. The rapidity gap survival probability, estimated from the comparison of the cross section measured in the first bin, 0:0003 < < 0:002, with LO and NLO diffractive MC models, ranges from 0:08 AE 0:04 (NLO) to 0:12 AE 0:05 (LO).",
