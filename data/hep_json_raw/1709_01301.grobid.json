            "text": "Studies of heavy quarkonium production play an important role in the development of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1,2]. According to the current theoretical framework, nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) [3,4], the production of heavy quarkonium factorizes into two steps, separated by different time and energy scales. In the first step, a heavy quark-antiquark pair, QQ, is created in a short time, of order /(2m Q c 2 ), where m Q is the heavy-quark mass. In the second step, the QQ pair, being produced in a colour-singlet or colour-octet [5] state, evolves nonperturbatively into a quarkonium state. The nonperturbative transitions from the initially produced QQ pairs to the observable colourless quarkonium states are described by long-distance matrix elements. According to the NRQCD factorization approach [4], these matrix elements are universal constants which are independent of the short-time production processes, and need to be determined from data. Calculations based on the colour-singlet model [6][7][8] show good agreement [9][10][11][12][13][14] with the experimental data [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] for production cross-sections and the shapes of the transverse momentum spectra. However, this approach fails to describe the spin-alignment (usually labelled as polarization) of S-wave charmonium states [23,24]. Leading-order colour-singlet calculations predict a transverse polarization for the S-wave",

            "text": "quarkonia, while next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations predict a longitudinal polarization for these states [10]. An analysis using NLO NRQCD calculations of the short-distance coefficients [14] concludes that the \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) bottomonium states should have a very small transverse polarization, almost independent of the transverse momentum, while the \u03a5(3S) meson should show a large transverse polarization at high transverse momenta. For the \u03a5(3S) meson this analysis neglects the contributions from the cascade decays of higher excited bottomonium states. Accounting for these contributions, e.g. from the radiative \u03c7 b (nP) \u2192 \u03a5\u03b3 decays 1 [25][26][27][28][29], is important for a correct interpretation of results [30]. The measured fractions of \u03a5 mesons originating from \u03c7 b decays are large, around 30 \u2212 40 % [28], for \u03a5 mesons with high transverse momenta, p \u03a5 T 20 GeV/c. Experimentally, polarization of \u03a5 mesons produced in high-energy hadron-hadron interactions was studied by the CDF collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.8 and 1.96 TeV [16,31]. It was found that the angular distributions of muons from \u03a5 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays for all three \u03a5 states are nearly isotropic in the central rapidity region y \u03a5 < 0.6 and p \u03a5 T < 40 GeV/c [31]. This result is inconsistent with the measurement performed by the D0 collaboration, where a significant p \u03a5 T -dependent longitudinal polarization was observed for \u03a5(1S) mesons produced in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, for y \u03a5 < 1.8 and p \u03a5 T < 20 GeV/c [32]. At the LHC the \u03a5 polarization was measured by the CMS collaboration [33] using pp collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, for the rapidity ranges y \u03a5 < 0.6 and 0.6 < y \u03a5 < 1.2, and for 10 < p \u03a5 T < 50 GeV/c. No evidence of large transverse or longitudinal polarization was found for any of the three \u03a5 mesons in the considered kinematic region.",

The spin-alignment parameters \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u2261 (\u03bb \u03b8 , \u03bb \u03b8\u03c6 , \u03bb \u03c6 ) are directly related to the spin-1 density-matrix elements [34,37]. Alternatively, these parameters are often denoted as (\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd/2). The case \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb = (0, 0, 0) corresponds to unpolarized \u03a5 mesons and for the chosen reference frame transverse (longitudinal) polarization corresponds to \u03bb \u03b8 > 0 (< 0). The parameters \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb depend on the choice for the reference system in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson. The following three frames are widely used in polarization analyses: helicity (HX), Collins-Soper (CS) and Gottfried-Jackson (GJ). In the HX frame [38], the z axis is defined as the direction of the \u03a5 momentum in the centre-of-mass frame of the colliding LHC protons, that is\u1e91 \u2261 \u2212 ( p 1 + p 2 ) / | p 1 + p 2 |, where p 1 and p 2 are the three-momenta of the colliding protons in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson. 2 In the CS frame [40], the z axis is defined such that it bisects the angle between p 1 and \u2212 p 2 in the rest frame of the \u03a5 meson. In the GJ frame [41], the z axis is defined as the direction of p 1 in the rest frame",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5 % at low momentum to 1.0 % at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors.

Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [50].

The \u03a5 candidates are formed from pairs of oppositely charged tracks. Each track is required to have a good reconstruction quality [60] and to be identified as a muon [61]. Each muon is then required to satisfy 1 < p T < 25 GeV/c, 10 < p < 400 GeV/c and have pseudorapidity within 2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.5. The two muons are required to be consistent with originating from a common vertex. The consistency of the dimuon vertex with a primary vertex is ensured via the quality requirement of a global fit, performed for each dimuon candidate using the primary vertex position as a constraint [62]. This requirement also reduces the background from genuine muons coming from decays of long-lived charm and beauty hadrons. The mass of the muon pair is required to be in the range 8.8 < m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 11.0 GeV/c 2 . A large fraction of the combinatorial background is characterized by a large absolute value of the cosine of the polar angle, cos \u03b8 GJ , of the \u00b5 + lepton in the GJ frame. The distributions of cos \u03b8 GJ for signal and for background components in a typical bin, 6 < p \u03a5 T < 8 GeV/c and 2.2 < y \u03a5 < 3.0, are shown in figure 1a. The components are determined using the sPlot technique, described below. To reduce this background, a requirement |cos \u03b8 GJ | < 0.8 is applied.",

They are considered for the polarization parameters \u03bb \u03b8 , \u03bb \u03b8\u03c6 , \u03bb \u03c6 and for the frame-invariant parameter\u03bb in the HX, CS and GJ frames for each p \u03a5 T , y \u03a5 bin. The systematic uncertainty related to the signal determination procedure is studied by varying the mass model describing the shape of the dimuon mass distributions. For the signal parametrizations, the power-law tail parameters of the double-sided Crystal Ball functions are fixed to the values obtained in the simulation, and the constraints for the mean values of the Crystal Ball functions describing the \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) signals are removed. The variation of the background parametrization is done by replacing the exponential function with the product of an exponential function and a polynomial function. Mass fit ranges are also varied. The maximum differences in each parameter \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb and\u03bb with respect to the nominal fit results are taken as systematic uncertainties. For all p \u03a5 T , y \u03a5 bins these uncertainties are around 10 % of the corresponding statistical uncertainties.",

This uncertainty is around 2 % of the statistical uncertainty for data in low-p \u03a5 T bins and rises to 8 % of the statistical uncertainty in high-p \u03a5 T bins. The uncertainties in the correction factors for the muon-pair identification efficiency \u03b5 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , related to small differences in the tracking and muon reconstruction efficiencies between data and simulation, are propagated to the determination of the polarization parameters using pseudoexperiments. These uncertainties are 20 % of the statistical uncertainty for low-p \u03a5 T bins and decrease to 10 % of the statistical uncertainty for high-p \u03a5 T bins. In this analysis the efficiency of the trigger is taken from simulation. The systematic uncertainty associated with a possible small difference in the trigger efficiency between data and simulation is assessed by studying the performance of the dimuon trigger, described in section 2, for events selected using the single-muon high-p T trigger [51]. The fractions of \u03a5(1S) signal candidates selected using both trigger requirements are compared for the data and simulation in p \u03a5 T , y \u03a5 bins and found to agree within 2 % [19,20].
