The results are interpreted in the context of models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Production cross section limits are set on gluino and squark pair production in this framework.

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [1][2][3][4][5][6] are extensions of the standard model (SM) that provide explanations for several outstanding issues with the SM. In particular, SUSY addresses the large quantum corrections to the mass term in the Higgs potential [7] and provides a viable dark matter candidate [8,9]. Models with general gauge-mediated (GGM) SUSY breaking [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] have the additional benefit of naturally suppressing flavor violations in the SUSY sector. GGM models can have a wide range of features but typically result in final states that include the gravitino ( G) as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) in these models is often taken to be a neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ), which is a mixture of the bino, neutral wino, and neutral higgsinos. The conservation of R parity [18] implies that the gravitino is stable and remains undetected. Therefore, proton-proton (pp) collisions that produce SUSY particles will have an imbalance in the total observed transverse momentum, referred to as missing transverse momentum p miss T and defined as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all visible particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . If the composition of the neutralino NLSP is primarily bino-like, its main decay will be to a gravitino and a photon (\u03b3), resulting in final states with significant missing transverse momentum and one or more photons.",

The event generator MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.3.3 [29] is used to simulate the signal samples at leading order. The background samples are generated at next-to-leading order using MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.4.2. For both signal and background processes, the parton showering, hadronization, SUSY particle decays, multiple-parton interactions, and the underlying event are described by the pythia 8.212 [30] program with the CUETP8M1 [31] generator tune. The signal samples are generated with either two gluinos or two squarks and up to two additional partons in the matrix element calculation. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) are obtained from the NNPDF3.0 [32] set. For the background processes, the detector response is simulated using Geant4 [33], while the CMS fast simulation [34,35] is used for the signal events. For both signal and background simulated events, additional pp interactions (pileup) are generated with pythia and superimposed on the primary collision process. The simulated events are reweighted to match the pileup distribution observed in data.",

The last bin is the overflow bin and includes all events with p miss T > 250 GeV. The QCD background is shown in red, the EWK background is shown in blue, and the Z\u03b3\u03b3 background is shown in green. The p miss T distribution shown in pink (purple) corresponds to the T5gg simplified model with m g = 1700 (2000) GeV and m \u03c7 0 1 = 1000 GeV. The p miss T",
