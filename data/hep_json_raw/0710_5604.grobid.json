The experiment has been taking data since 2003. Since no evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay of 100 Mo and 82 Se has been found, a 90% C.L. lower limit on the half-life of this process and corresponding upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass are derived. The data are also interpreted in terms of alternative models, such as weak right-handed currents or Majoron emission. In addition, NEMO 3 has performed precision measurements of the two-neutrino double beta decay for seven different isotopes. The most recent experimental results of NEMO 3 are presented in this paper.",

The level of each background component has been directly measured from data using different analysis channels. The dominant background during the first running period from February 2003 to September 2004, Phase I, was due to radon diffusion into the tracking wire chamber. Nevertheless, during Phase II (since November 2004 up to now), the radon level inside NEMO 3 has been reduced by a factor of ten thanks to the radon trapping facility. Remaining low radon activity inside NEMO 3 is due to degasing of detector components.",
