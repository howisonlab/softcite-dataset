The results are compared to different models of multiple parton interactions (MPI) in the pythia and sherpa Monte Carlo (MC) generators. The data indicate a contribution from events with double parton (DP) interactions and are well described by predictions provided by the pythia MPI models with pT -ordered showers and by sherpa with the default MPI model. The \u03b3 + 2 jet data are also used to determine the fraction of events with DP interactions as a function of the azimuthal angle and as a function of the second jet pT .",

            "text": "The high energy scattering of two nucleons can be considered, in a simplified model, as a single collision of one parton (quark or gluon) from one nucleon with one parton from the other nucleon. In this approach, the remaining \"spectator\" partons, which do not take part in the hard 2 \u2192 2 parton collision, participate in the so-called \"underlying event.\" However, there are also models that allow for the possibility that two or more parton pairs undergo a hard interaction when two hadrons collide. These MPI events have been examined in many theoretical papers [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. A comprehensive review of MPI models in hadron collisions is given in [9]. A significant amount of experimental data, from the CERN ISR pp collider [18], the CERN SPS pp collider [19], the Fermilab Tevatron pp collider [20][21][22][23][24] and the DESY HERA ep collider [25,26], shows clear evidence for MPI events.",

They have evolved from the first \"simple\" model sug-gested in [7], to more sophisticated models [10,11] that consider MPI with correlations in parton momentum and color, as well as effects balancing MPI and initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR) effects, which are implemented in the recent (\"p T -ordered\") models [12].",

These cross sections are sensitive to the contributions from jets originating from additional parton hard interactions (beyond the dominant one) and can be used to improve existing MPI models, and to estimate the fractions of such events [21,24,33]. The cross section measurements are performed at the particle level, which means that the jets' four-momenta represent the real energy and direction of the jet of stable particles resulting from the hadronization process following the pp interaction [34]. The larger statistics in \u03b3 + 2 jet events allows to subdivide the cross section measurement in bins of the second jet p T (p jet2 T ).

The \u2206\u03c6 distribution in \u03b3 + 2 jet events has been used to estimate the DP fraction by the CDF Collaboration [33]. The p T spectrum for jets from dijet events falls faster than that for jets, resulting from ISR and FSR in \u03b3 + jet events, and thus the DP fractions should depend on the jet p T [1, 3-6, 9, 24]. For this reason, the \u2206\u03c6 dependent cross sections and the DP fractions in the \u03b3 + 2 jet events are measured in three p jet2 Such a measurement provides good sensitivity to the DP contribution, and discriminating power between different MPI models because the DP fraction in \u03b3 +3 jet events is expected to be higher than that in \u03b3 + 2 jet events. This is expected since the second parton interaction will usually produce a dijet final state, while the production of an additional jet in SP events via gluon bremsstrahlung is suppressed by the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s .",

These triggers are 100% efficient for photons with transverse momentum p \u03b3 T > 35 GeV. To select photon candidates for our data sample, we use the following criteria [24,38]. EM objects are reconstructed using a simple cone algorithm with a cone size R = 0.2 around a seed tower in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space [38]. Regions with poor photon identification capability and limited p \u03b3 T resolution (found at the boundaries between calorimeter modules and between the central and end calorimeters) are excluded from the analysis. Each photon candidate is required to deposit more than 96% of its detected energy in the EM section of the calorimeter and to be isolated in the annular region between R = 0.2 and R = 0.4 around the center of the cluster: (E iso Tot \u2212 E iso Core )/E iso Core < 0.07, where E iso Tot is the total (EM+hadronic) energy in the cone of radius R = 0.4 and E iso Core is the EM tower energy within a radius R = 0.2. The probability for candidate EM clusters to be spatially matched to a reconstructed track is required to be < 0.1%, where this probability is calculated using the spatial resolutions measured in data. We also require the energy-weighted EM cluster width in the finely-segmented third EM layer to be consistent with that expected for an electromagnetic shower. In addition to calorimeter isolation, we apply track isolation, requiring that the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of tracks in an annulus of 0.05 \u2264 R \u2264 0.4, calculated around the EM cluster direction, is less than 1.5 GeV.",

The higher p \u03b3 T scale (i.e., the scale of the first parton interaction), compared to the lower p T threshold required of the second (and eventual third) jet, results in a good separation between the first and second parton interactions of a DP event in momentum space.

The two categories, \"old\" and \"new,\" correspond to different approaches in the treatment of MPI, ISR and FSR, and other effects [10,12]. The main difference between the \"new\" [11] and the \"old\" models is the implementation of the interplay between MPI and ISR, i.e., considering these two effects in parallel, in a common sequence of decreasing p T values. In the \"old\" models, ISR and FSR were included only for the hardest interaction, and this was done before any additional interactions were considered. In the \"new\" models, all parton interactions include ISR and FSR separately for each interaction. The new models, especially those corresponding to the Perugia family of tunes [10], also allow for a much wider set of physics processes to occur in the additional interactions. A detailed description of the different pythia MPI mod-els can be found elsewhere [10,11]. Here we provide a brief description of the models considered in our analysis. They include: Perugia-0 (P0, the default model in the Perugia family [10]); P-hard and P-soft, which explore the dependence on the strength of ISR/FSR effects, while maintaining a roughly-consistent MPI model as implemented in the P0 tune; P-nocr, which excludes any color reconnections in the final state; P-X and P-6, which are P0 modifications based on the MRST LO* and CTEQ6L1 PDF sets, respectively (P0 uses CTEQ5L as a default).

With the MPI event generation switched off, all the additional (to the leading) jets are produced in the parton shower development in the initial and final states. We refer to such SP events as \"pythia SP\" events. In sherpa, up to two extra partons (and thus jets) are allowed at the matrix element level in the 2 \u2192 {2, 3, 4} scattering, but jets can also be produced in parton showers. To provide a matching between the matrix-element partons and parton shower jets, we follow the recommendation provided in [42] and choose the following \"matching\" parameters: the energy scale Q 0 = 30 GeV and the spatial scale D = 0.4, where D is taken to be of the size of the photon isolation cone [43]. This is the default scheme for the production of \u03b3 + jet events with and without MPI simulation. The set of events produced without MPI simulation within this scheme is called \"sherpa-1 SP\". We study the dependence of the measured DP fractions on the scale choice in the sherpa SP models in Sec. VII by setting the matching scale Q 0 equal to 20 and to 40 GeV (sets \"sherpa-2\" and \"sherpa-3\" respectively). For completeness we consider sherpa SP events in which all of the extra jets are produced (as in pythia) in the parton shower with only a 2 \u2192 2 matrix element, and call this set \"sherpa-4 SP\".",

The photon-enhancing criteria described in Sec. III are developed to suppress this background. The normalized \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions are not very sensitive to the exact amount of background from events with misidentified photons. To estimate the photon fractions in the \u2206\u03c6 bins, we use the output of two neural networks (NN) [38]. These NNs are constructed using the jetnet package [44] and are trained to discriminate between photon and EM-jets in the central and end calorimeter regions using calorimeter shower shape and track isolation variables [38]. The distribution of the photon NN output for the simulated photon signal and for the dijet background samples are fitted to data in each \u2206\u03c6 bin using a maximum likelihood fit [45] to obtain the fractions of signal events in the data. To obtain a more statistically significant estimate of the photon purity in the \u2206\u03c6 bins, we use a single p jet2 The sensitivity of the \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions to this background from jets is also examined by considering two data samples in addition to the sample with the default photon selections: one with relaxed and another with tighter track and calorimeter isolation requirements. According to MC estimates, in those two samples the fraction of background events should either increase or decrease by (30 \u2212 35)% with respect to the default sample. We study the variation of the \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 normalized cross sections in data by comparing the relaxed and tighter data sets with the default set. We find that the cross section variations are within 5%.",

The selected events are then corrected for selection efficiency, acceptance, and event migration effects in bins of \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6. These corrections are calculated using MC events generated using pythia with tune P0, as discussed in Sec. IV. The generated MC events are processed through a geantbased [46] simulation of the D0 detector response. These MC events are then processed using the same reconstruction code as used for the data. We also apply additional smearing to the reconstructed photon and jet p T so that the resolutions in MC match those observed in data. The reconstructed \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions in the simulated events using the P0 tune are found to describe the data. In addition to the simulation with the default tune P0, we have also considered P0 MC events that have been reweighted to reproduce the p T distributions in data. After such reweighting, the reconstructed \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions give an excellent description of the data. Figures 3 and 4 show the normalized distributions as a function of \u2206S for \u03b3 + 3 jet and \u2206\u03c6 for \u03b3 + 2 jet events (for the p jet2 Three sets of corrections are applied in data to obtain the differential cross sections which we then compare with the various MPI models. We apply them to correct for detector and reconstruction inefficiencies and for bin migration effects. The first correction deals with the possibility that, due to the detector and reconstruction effects, our selected event sample may contain events which would fail the selection criteria at the particle level. The data distributions are corrected, on a bin-by-bin basis, for the fraction of events of this type. We also apply a correction for events which fail the selection requirement at the reconstruction level. Systematic uncertainties are assigned on these two correction factors to account for uncertainties on the photon and jet identification, the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution, and vary in the \u2206S (\u2206\u03c6) bins up to 12% (18%) in total. They are dominated by the JES uncertainties. The overall corrections obtained with the default P0 and with the reweighted MC samples agree within about 5% for most \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 bins and differ by at most 25%. Since we are measur-ing normalized cross sections, the absolute values of the corrections are not important, and we need only their relative dependence on \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6.",

To obtain the \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions at the particle level, we follow the unfolding procedure described in the Appendix, based on the Tikhonov regularization method [47][48][49][50]. The bin sizes for the \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions are chosen to have sensitivity to different MPI models (which is largest for small \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 angles) while keeping good statistics and the bin-to-bin migration small. The statistical uncertainties (\u03b4 stat ) are in the range (10 \u2212 18)%. They are due to the procedure of regularized unfolding and take into account the correlations between the bins. The correlation factor for adjacent bins in the unfolded distributions is about (30 \u2212 45)%, and it is reduced to \u2248 10% for other (nextto-adjacent) bins. To validate the unfolding procedure, a MC closure test is performed. We compare the unfolded MC distribution to the true MC distribution and find that they agree within statistical uncertainties.",

However, from Figs. 9 -11, the fraction of DP events is expected to be higher at smaller \u2206\u03c6 . To determine the fractions as a function of \u2206\u03c6 , we perform a fit in the different \u2206\u03c6 regions by excluding the bins at high \u2206\u03c6 ; specifically, by considering the \u2206\u03c6 regions 0 \u2212 2.85, 0 \u2212 2.65, 0 \u2212 2.45, 0 \u2212 2.15, and 0 \u2212 1.60. The DP fractions for these \u2206\u03c6 regions are shown in Table VIII for the three p jet2 T intervals. The DP fractions with total uncertainties as functions of the upper limit on \u2206\u03c6 (\u2206\u03c6 max ) for all the p jet2 T bins are also shown in Fig. 12. As expected, they grow significantly towards the smaller angles and are higher for smaller p jet2 T bins.",

However, since each component of the MixDP model may contain two (or more) jets, where one jet is due to an additional  parton interaction, the model simulates the properties of \"double plus triple\" parton interactions. Therefore, the \"DP\" fractions found earlier in the \u03b3 + 3 jet data (shown in Table III of [24]) take into account a contribution from TP interactions as well. These fractions are also shown in the second column of Table IX.

We separately analyze each of the event types of Fig. 13. The fraction of events having a second parton interaction with a dijet final state with cross section \u03c3 jj can be defined using the effective cross section \u03c3 eff as f jj dp = \u03c3 jj /(2\u03c3 eff ). The cross section for a DP scattering producing two dijet final states can be presented then as \u03c3 jj,jj dp = \u03c3 jj f jj dp [7,9]. The fraction f jj dp is estimated using dijet events simulated with pythia. We calculate the jet cross sections \u03c3 jj for producing at least one jet in the three p T bins with |\u03b7 jet | < 3.5. The effective cross section \u03c3 eff is taken as an average of the CDF [21] and D0 [24] measurements, \u03c3 average eff = 15.5 mb. The determined fractions are shown in the third column of Table X. We assume that the estimates, done at the particle level, are also approximately correct at the reconstruction level. We take an uncertainty on these numbers \u03b4f jj dp = f jj dp . The fractions of the \u03b3+2 jet events in which the second jet is due to an additional parton scattering are estimated in the previous section and are much higher than f jj dp . However, since we estimate the TP fraction in data at the reconstruction level, we repeat the same fitting procedure used for the extraction of f \u03b32j dp from the \u2206\u03c6 distributions in the reconstructed data and SP \u03b3 + 2 jet MC events. The results of the fit in the three p jet2 T intervals are summarized in the second column of Table X.

We use the following approach to extract the desired distributions from our measurements. The observed distribution is the result of the convolution of a resolution function with the desired distribution at the particle level. After the discretization in \u2206S/\u2206\u03c6 bins, the resolution function is a smearing matrix, and distributions on both particle level and reconstruction level become discrete distributions (i.e., histograms). The smearing matrix is stochastic: all elements are non-negative and the sum of elements in each column is equal to 1. Thus, the matrix columns are the probability density functions that relate each bin in a histogram at the particle level to the bins in a histogram at the reconstruction level. We split the full \u2206S (\u2206\u03c6) range [0, \u03c0] into eight bins and fix two bins at small \u2206S (\u2206\u03c6) angles as 0 \u2212 0.7 and 0.7 \u2212 1.2 radians. These two bins are the most sensitive to a contribution from DP scattering, and their widths are chosen as a compromise between sensitivity to DP events and the size of the relative statistical uncertainty. The sizes of the other six bins are varied to minimize the ratio of maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the smearing matrix, defined as the condition number. This ratio, greater than unity, represents the scaling factor for the statistical uncertainties arising from the transformation of the differential cross sections from the reconstructed to the particle level. The same binning is used for the reconstructed and particle level distributions. We build the smearing matrix using reconstructed and particle level events in the reweighted MC sample, described in Sec. V B. To decrease the statistical uncertainties (\u03b4 stat ), we use a Tikhonov regular-ization procedure [47][48][49][50] for the matrix. This unfolding procedure may introduce a bias (b). We optimize the regularization by finding a balance between \u03b4 stat and b according to the following criterion: we minimize the following function of \u03b4 stat and b in the first two bins, 0 \u2212 0.7 and 0.7 \u2212 1.2:",

            "text": "These two bins, being the most sensitive to contributions from DP scatterings, are the most important for our analysis. We perform the regularization of the smearing matrix by adding a non-negative parameter \u03b1 to all diagonal elements of the smearing matrix. The matrix columns are then re-normalized to make the matrix stochastic again (\u03b1 = 0 is equivalent no regularization, while for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e the smearing matrix becomes the identity matrix). The smallest uncertainties U are usually achieved with \u03b1 = 0.3 \u2212 0.5. An estimate of the unfolded distribution is obtained by multiplying the histogram (vector) of the measured \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions by the inverted regularized smearing matrix. We use the sample of the reweighted MC events to get an estimate of the statistical uncertainties and the bias in bins of the unfolded distribution. To accomplish this, we choose a MC subsample with the number of events equal to that of the selected data sample and having a discrete distribution (histogram) at the reconstruction level that is almost identical to that in data. We randomize the MC histogram at the reconstruction level repeatedly (100,000 times) according to a multinomial distribution and multiply this histogram by the inverted regularized smearing matrix for each perturbation. We obtain a set of unfolded distributions at the particle level. Using this set and the true distribution for this MC sample, we estimate the statistical uncertainty \u03b4 stat and the bias b as the RMS and the mean of the distribution \"(true\u2212unfolded)/true\" for each \u2206S (\u2206\u03c6) bin. The unfolded distribution is then corrected for the bias in each bin. We assign half of the bias as a systematic uncertainty on this correction. The overall unfolding corrections vary up to 60%, being largest at the small angles. The total uncertainties, estimated in each bin i for the \u2206S and \u2206\u03c6 distributions as",
