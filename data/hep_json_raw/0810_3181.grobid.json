The muons from pions that decayed on the surface of the target were transported by the M13 surface muon channel to the detector, which 2 was located in the bore of a 2 T solenoidal magnet. Ahead of the magnet was a removable time expansion chamber [3] to measure the emittance of the muon beam. At the center of the detector was a thin Al stopping target. Positrons from muon decay were detected in an array of planar MWPC and drift chambers arranged symmetrically upstream and downstream of the stopping target. [4] Analysis of the data produced a spectrum of reconstructed energies and angles of the positrons. This spectrum was compared to a simulated spectrum to extract the decay parameters. The information for the simulated positrons was generated in the same format as the data and analyzed using the same codes. However, the simulated spectrum was generated with hidden values of the decay parameters, so the actual values for the data were not revealed until after all of the corrections and systematic uncertainties were determined.",
