            "text": "Hadronic weak decays of charmed mesons provide important information on flavor mixing, CP violation, and strong-interaction effects [1]. There are several proposed QCD-derived theoretical approaches to handle heavy meson decays [2][3][4][5][6]. However, in contrast to B mesons, theoretical treatment of charmed mesons suffers from large uncertainties since the c quark mass is too light for good convergence of the heavy quark expansion but still much too massive for chiral perturbative theory to be applicable. Currently, theoretical results for the partial decay widths of ground-state charmed mesons agree fairly well with experimental results. However, there exists a contradiction concerning the 2 Also at Ankara University, 06100 Tandogan, Ankara, Turkey. 3 Also at Bogazici University, 34342 Istanbul, Turkey. 4 Also at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow 141700, Russia. 5 Also at the Functional Electronics Laboratory, Tomsk State University, Tomsk, 634050, Russia. 6 Also at the Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russia. 7 Also at the NRC \"Kurchatov Institute\", PNPI, 188300, Gatchina, Russia. 8 Also at University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083, USA. 9 Currently at Istanbul Arel University, 34295 Istanbul, Turkey.",

To obtain the DT yields, we therefore perform a two-dimensional unbinned fit to the variables M BC (\u03b1) and M(\u03b7 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 ). For M BC (\u03b1), the fit functions are the same as those used in the extraction of y \u03b1 ST .

Component (a) is described with a first-order polynomial function. Component (b) is modeled with the sum of two Gaussian functions plus a quadratic polynomial function. The means of the two Gaussians are fixed to the \u03b7 nominal mass [9]. Other parameters and all the amplitudes are left free in the fit. The ARGUS function of M BC (\u03b1) helps to constrain the description of M(\u03b7 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 ) in component (b).
