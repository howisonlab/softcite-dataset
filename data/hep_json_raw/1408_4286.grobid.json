Partial-wave analyses reveal different odd/even angular momentum (L) characteristics in the inspected invariant mass range up to 3 GeV/c 2 . A striking similarity between the two systems is observed for the L = 2, 4, 6 intensities (scaled by kinematical factors) and the relative phases. The known resonances a 2 (1320) and a 4 (2040) are in line with this similarity. In contrast,",

Using the information from beam particle identification detectors, it was checked that K \u2212 and p admixtures to the 97% \u03c0 \u2212 beam are insignificant in the final sample analysed here. Recoiling target protons were identified by their time of flight and energy loss in a detector (RPD) which consisted of two cylindrical rings of scintillating counters at distances of 12 cm and 78 cm from the beam axis, covering the polar angle range above 50 \u2022 as seen from the target centre. The angular range between the RPD and the opening angle of the spectrometer of about \u00b110 \u2022 was covered mostly by a large-area photon and charged-particle veto detector (SW), thus enriching the data recording with kinematically complete events [16]. The trigger for taking the present data required coincidence between beam definition counters and the RPD, and no veto from the SW nor from a small counter telescope for non-interacting beam particles far downstream (32 m) from the target. A sample of 4.5 \u00d7 10 9 events was recorded with this trigger in 2008.",

These contain 116 000 and 39 000 events, respectively, including 5% background from non-\u03b7 ( ) events. These can be discerned. For higher masses, increasingly narrow forward/backward peaks are observed. This feature corresponds to the emergence of a rapidity gap. In terms of partial waves it  indicates coherent contributions from larger angular momenta. Forward/backward asymmetries (only weakly affected by acceptance) occur for all masses in both channels, which indicates interference of odd and even partial waves. In the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 data, the a 2 (1320) is close to the threshold energy of this channel (1.1 GeV), and the signal is not dominant, see also Fig. 1 (b). A forward/backward asymmetric interference pattern, indicating coherent D-and P -wave contributions with mass-dependent relative phase, governs the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 mass range up to 2 GeV/c 2 . In the a 4 (2040) region, well-localised interference is recognised. As for \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 , narrow forward/backward peaking occurs at higher mass, but in this case the forward/backward asymmetry is visibly larger over the whole mass range of \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 . The data were subjected to a partial-wave analysis (PWA) using a program developed at Illinois and VES [21][22][23]. Independent fits were carried out in 40 MeV/c 2 wide bins of the four-body mass from threshold up to 3 GeV/c 2 (so-called mass-independent PWA). Momentum transfers were limited to the range given above.",

The D-wave intensity is a factor of twenty larger than the P -wave intensity. These observations resemble those at lower beam energy [7,9]. A similar P -wave peak was observed in pn annihilation at rest, where it appears with an intensity comparable to that of the D-wave [29]. The present D-wave is characterised by a dominant a 2 (1320) peak and a broad shoulder that extends to higher masses and possibly contains the Phase motions in both systems can best be studied with respect to the D-wave, which is present with sufficient intensity in the full mass range. The rapid phase rotations caused by the a 2 (1320) and a 4 (2040) resonances are discernible. The P versus D-wave phases in both systems are almost the same from the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 threshold up to 1.4 GeV/c 2 where a branching takes place. Given the similarity of the D-wave intensities after applying a kinematical factor (see below), it is suggestive to ascribe the different relative phase motions in the 1.4 GeV/c 2 -2.0 GeV/c 2 range to the P -wave. It is noted that the P -wave intensities drop dramatically within this region, almost vanishing at 1.8 GeV/c 2 in \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and at 2 GeV/c 2 in \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 .

If these fits are restricted to masses below 1.9 GeV/c 2 , comparable to previous analyses, a simple model incorporating only P and D-wave Breit-Wigner amplitudes and a coherent D-wave background yields \u03c0 1 (1400) \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 resonance parameters and \u03c0 1 (1600) \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 resonance parameters consistent with those of Refs. [7][8][9]. However, the inclusion of higher masses demands additional model amplitudes, in particular additional D-wave resonances and coherent P -wave backgrounds. The presence of a coherent background in the P -wave is suggested by the PWA results in Figs. 3, 4, 5 (a): The vanishing of the intensities around 2.0 GeV/c 2 is ascribed to destructive interference within this partial wave, and the relatively slow phase motion across the \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 P -wave peak demands the additional amplitude in order to dampen the \u03c0 1 (1600) phase rotation. Fitted P -wave resonance masses in both channels are found to be shifted upwards by typically 200 MeV/c 2 when introducing constant-phase model backgrounds as in Ref. [23]. In the present Letter, we refrain from proposing resonance parameters for the exotic P -wave or even the exotic F and H -waves observed here. The present observations at masses beyond the a 2 (1320) and the \u03c0 1 structures might stimulate extensions of resonance-production models, as e.g. multi-Regge models [13].",

The final fit model is restricted to the coherent L = 1-6, M = 1 plus L = 2, M = 2 partial waves from natural parity transfer ( = +1) and the incoherent backgrounds introduced above.Incoherence of partial waves of the same naturality, leading to additional terms in Eq. (1), could arise from contributions with and without proton helicity flip, or from different t-dependences of the amplitudes over the broad t range. However, for two pseudoscalars, incoherence or partial incoherence of any two partial waves with M = 1 can be accommodated by full coherence with appropriate choice of phase[7]. Comparing PWA results for t above and be-low 0.3 (GeV/c) 2 , no significant variation of the relative M = 1 amplitudes with t is observed [18]. The L = 2, M = 2 contribution shows a different t-dependence but does not introduce significant incoherence. In general, a two-pseudoscalar PWA suffers from discrete ambiguities [27,28,24]. The observed insignificance of unnatural-parity transfer crucially reduces the ambiguities. In the case of \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 , the remaining ambiguities are resolved when the M = 2 D-wave amplitude is introduced. For \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 , ambiguities occur when the PWA is extended beyond the dominant L = 1, 2 and 4 waves. We resolve this by requiring continuous behaviour of the dominant partial waves and of the Barrelet zeros [24]. The acceptable solutions agree within the statistical uncertainties with the solution selected here, which is the one with the smallest L = 3 contribution. The results of the PWA are presented as intensities of all included partial waves in Figs. 3, 4, and as relative phases with respect to the L = 2, M = 1 wave in Fig. 5. The plotted intensities are the acceptance-corrected numbers of events in each mass bin, as derived from the |A LM | 2 of Eq. (1).

The F , H and I -waves (L = 3, 5, 6) adopt each less than 1% of the intensity in the present mass range but are significant in the likelihood fit as can be judged from the uncertainties given inTable 1.The \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 P and D-waves have comparable intensities. The former peaks at 1.65 GeV/c 2 , drops to almost zero at 2 GeV/c 2 and displays a broad second maximum around 2.4 GeV/c 2 . The D-wave shows a two-part structure similar to \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 but with relatively larger intensity of the shoulder. The G-wave distribution shows an a 4 (2040) plus bump shape as observed for \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 . In contrast to the G and I -waves, the odd F and H -waves have a factor of 2-3 more intensity than in the \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 channel. Relative to the total intensities observed in the two channels, the odd-L waves are enhanced by an order of magnitude in \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 . The F -wave distribution features a broad peak around 2.6 GeV/c 2 .",

This feature remains if r = 0.4 fm, but the values of R L increase with increasing r (Table 1). This similarity is corroborated by the relative phases as observed in Figs. 5 (d) and (f).
