Events are selected in final states with two charged leptons and at least two jets and in final states with one charged lepton and at least four jets. Four different observables sensitive to different properties of the top quark pair production mechanism are used to extract the correlation between the top and antitop quark spins. Some of these observables are measured for the first time. The measurements are in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leadingorder accuracy.",

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which collided protons (pp) at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011, top quarks were mainly produced in pairs via gluon fusion. In the SM, tt pairs are produced essentially unpolarized at hadron colliders [3], as has been tested in recent measurements by the D0 Collaboration [4] and the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [5,6]. Nonetheless, the correlation of the spin orientation of the top quark and the top antiquark can be studied, and is predicted to be nonzero [3,[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].",

Also, they can modify the tt decay by which the spin information is accessed. The first scenario occurs, for example, in BSM models where a tt pair is produced via a high-mass Z 0 boson [25,26] or via a heavy Higgs boson that decays into tt [27]. The second scenario occurs, for example, in supersymmetric models if a top quark decays into a spin zero particle like a charged Higgs boson, which then decays into a lepton and a neutrino [28,29]. Thus measuring the spin correlation in tt events can simultaneously probe top production and (indirectly) decay for potential effects due to new physics.",

Observables in the laboratory frame and in different top quark spin quantization bases are explored. These variables are used to measure the coefficient f SM , which is related to the number of events where the t andt spins are correlated as predicted by the SM, assuming that tt production consists of events with spin correlation as in the SM or without spin correlation. The measured value of f SM is translated into the spin correlation strength A, which is a measure for the number of events where the top quark and top antiquark spins are parallel minus the number of events where they are antiparallel with respect to a spin quantization axis, divided by the total number of events.",

Using events with one or two isolated leptons in the final state, spin correlations are measured using \u0394\u03d5 between the lepton and one of the final-state jets or between the two leptons, respectively. Additional measurements are performed in the final state with two leptons, using observables that are sensitive to different types of sources of new physics in tt production. In particular, angular correlations between the charged leptons from top quark decays in two different spin quantization bases and a ratio of matrix elements in the dileptonic channel are also measured.",

A significantly lower yield in the dielectron channel compared to the dimuon channel is due to the stringent isolation criteria and higher p T cut on the electrons. The yield difference between tt signal with SM spin correlation and without spin correlation is found to be negligible in the e AE \u03bc \u2213 channel but not in the e \u00fe e \u2212 or \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 channels. Here, the cut on the invariant mass of the dilepton system used to suppress backgrounds also preferentially selects uncorrelated tt pairs over correlated pairs.

Other background contributions arise from Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u00fe jets production, where the Z boson decays into a pair of leptons and one of the leptons does not pass the selection requirements, from electroweak processes (diboson and single top quark production in the s, t channel, and Wt processes) and from multijets events, where a lepton from the decay of a heavy-flavor quark appears isolated or a jet mimics an electron. Additional background arising from tt events with two leptons in the final state, where one lepton lies outside the acceptance, is studied with MC@NLO MC simulation and treated as part of the signal. The diboson, single top quark and Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u00fe jets backgrounds are estimated using simulated events normalized to the theoretical cross sections. The W \u00fe jets events are generated with ALPGEN V2.13, using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set with up to five additional partons. Separate samples are generated for W \u00fe bb, W \u00fe cc, and W \u00fe c production at the matrixelement level. The normalization of the W \u00fe jets background and its heavy-flavor content are extracted from data by a method exploiting the W \u00fe jets production charge asymmetry [59]. Single top quark s-channel and Wtchannel production is generated using MC@NLO, where the diagram removal scheme is invoked in the Wt-channel production to avoid overlap between single top quark and tt final states [69]. For the t channel, ACERMC [70] with PYTHIA parton shower and modified LO PDFs (MRST LO** [71]) is used.",

Quoted uncertainties include the statistical uncertainty on the yield and the uncertainty on the theoretical cross sections used for MC normalization. The uncertainty on the DD estimate is statistical only. the single-lepton final states, and the latter three variables are only used in the dilepton final state. (i) The azimuthal opening angle, \u0394\u03d5, between the momentum directions of a top quark decay product and an antitop quark decay product in the laboratory frame. In the dilepton final state, \u0394\u03d5 between the charged lepton momentum directions, \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l \u00fe ; l \u2212 \u00de, is explored. This observable is straightforward to measure and very sensitive because like-helicity gluon-gluon initial states dominate [75]. It was used in Ref. [35] to observe a nonvanishing spin correlation, consistent with the SM prediction. In the singlelepton channel, \u0394\u03d5 between the charged lepton momentum direction and either the down-type jet from W boson decay, \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; d\u00de, or the b jet from the hadronically decaying top quark, \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; b\u00de, are analyzed. Since this requires the identification of the jets from the W boson and hadronically decaying top quark, full event reconstruction is necessary, making the measurement of \u0394\u03d5 in the single-lepton channel more challenging. Moreover, there is a need to identify the jet emerging from the down-type quark from W boson decay (see Sec. VII B for more details).

Since the likehelicity gluon-gluon matrix elements are used for the construction of the S ratio, it is particularly sensitive to like-helicity gluon-gluon initial states. To measure this observable, and the two others described below, the top quark and the top antiquark have to be fully reconstructed. (iii) The double differential distribution [Eq. 2], where the top direction in the tt rest frame is used as the spin quantization axis. The measurement of this distribution allows for a direct extraction of the spin correlation strength A helicity [3], as defined in Eq. 3. The SM prediction is A SM helicity \u00bc 0.31, which was calculated including NLO QCD corrections to tt production and decay and mixed weak-QCD corrections to the production amplitudes in Ref. [24]. MC@NLO, which includes NLO QCD corrections to tt production but not to top quark decay, reproduces the same value after adding parton shower simulated by HERWIG. (iv) The double differential distribution [Eq. 2], using the \"maximal\" basis as the top spin quantization axis. For the gluon-gluon fusion process, which is a mixture of like-helicity and unlike-helicity initial states, no optimal axis exists where the spin correlation strength is 100%. This is in contrast to the quark-antiquark annihilation process where an optimal \"off-diagonal\" basis was first identified by Ref. [76]. However, event by event a quantization axis that maximizes spin correlation and is called the maximal basis can be constructed for the gluon fusion process [77]. A prediction for the tt spin correlation using this observable is not yet available for 7 TeV pp collisions. Therefore, the prediction is calculated using the MC@NLO+HERWIG simulation resulting in A SM maximal \u00bc 0.44. Figure 1 shows all four observables for 1(a) generated charged leptons from top quark decay and 1(b), 1(c), 1(d) top quarks in the dilepton final state, calculated with MC@NLO under the assumption of SM tt spin correlation and no spin correlation, as defined in Sec.

In this way four independent C-even and P-even spin correlation coefficients that are functions of the partonic center-of-mass energy and the production angle are introduced. The four observables investigated here depend on different linear combinations of these four coefficient functions.",

The measured f SM is f SM \u00bc 1.26 AE 0.14\u00f0stat\u00de when using the \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; d\u00de observable, and f SM \u00bc 0.64 AE 0.18\u00f0stat\u00de for \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; b\u00de. Fitting both distributions simultaneously resulted in a value of f SM compatible with the true value, namely f SM \u00bc 1.02 AE 0.11\u00f0stat\u00de. The difference is explained to a large extent by the difference of the top quark p T distributions in POWHEG and MC@NLO. The recent measurements by the ATLAS [82] and CMS [83] Collaborations indicate that the top quark p T distributions vary between the generators and that the top quark p T distribution in data is better described by POWHEG interfaced with HERWIG [82]. Ensemble tests performed using templates produced after reweighting the top quark p T in the MC@NLO sample to the distribution in POWHEG show a reduced difference between the results obtained using different analyzers: f SM \u00bc 1.13 AE 0.14\u00f0stat\u00de when using \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; d\u00de, f SM \u00bc 0.77 AE 0.18\u00f0stat\u00de for \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; b\u00de, and f SM \u00bc 0.99 AE 0.11\u00f0stat\u00de if the simultaneous fit to both observables is performed.

One can see that top quark p T reweighting causes the same trend, but it has the opposite direction with respect to the no spin correlation and SM spin correlation hypotheses for the \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; d\u00de and \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; b\u00de distributions: for \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; d\u00de the reweighting leads to a shape corresponding to larger spin correlation strength than in the SM, while for \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; b\u00de the shape corresponds to a smaller spin correlation strength.",

Lepton uncertainties (quoted as \"Lepton reconstruction\" in Table III) include trigger efficiency and identification uncertainties for electrons and muons, and uncertainties due to electron (muon) energy (momentum) calibration and resolution. Uncertainty associated with the jet energy calibration is referred to as \"Jet energy scale,\" while jet reconstruction efficiency and resolution uncertainties are combined and quoted as \"Jet reconstruction\" in Table III. Uncertainties on the E miss T include uncertainties due to the pileup modeling and the modeling of energy deposits not associated with the reconstructed objects. A number of systematic uncertainties affecting the tt modeling are considered. Systematic uncertainty associated with the choice of factorization and renormalization scales in MC@NLO is evaluated by varying the default scales by a factor of 2 up and down simultaneously. The uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronization model is determined by comparing two alternative samples simulated with the POWHEG (HVQ V4) [85] generator interfaced with PYTHIA 6.425 [86] and HERWIG v6.520. The uncertainty on the amount of initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) in the simulated tt sample is assessed by comparing ALPGEN, showered with PYTHIA, with varied amounts of initial-and final-state radiation. The size of the variation is compatible with the recent measurements of additional jet activity in tt events [87]. The uncertainty due to the choice of the underlying event model is estimated by comparing a POWHEG-generated sample showered by PYTHIA with the PERUGIA 2011 tune to one with the PERUGIA 2011 MPIHI tune [88]. The latter is a variation of the PYTHIA 2011 tune with more semihard multiple parton interactions. The impact of the color reconnection model of the partons that enter hadronization is assessed by comparing samples generated with POWHEG and showered by PYTHIA with the PERUGIA 2011 tune and the PERUGIA 2011 NOCR tune [88]. To investigate the effect of the choice of PDF used in the analysis, the uncertainties from the nominal CT10 PDF set and from the NNPDF2.3 [89] and MSTW2008 [90] NLO PDF sets are considered, and the envelope of these uncertainties is taken as the uncertainty estimate. The dependence of the measured f SM on the top quark mass is evaluated by changing the value of 172.5 GeV used in the simulation and performing a linear fit of the dependency of the considered observable on the top quark mass within the mass range 172.5 AE 5 GeV.",

(2). This becomes obvious in Eqs. 4and (5), which show that the expectation value of cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u00fe \u00de cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u2212 \u00de is equal to A modulo constant factors. Therefore, the extraction of f SM using the full distribution in a template method is equivalent to extracting the spin correlation in the respective spin quantization basis A measured basis . The relation is given by with the SM predictions being A SM helicity \u00bc 0.31 and A SM maximal \u00bc 0.44, respectively, as discussed in Sec. VI. Combining all three final states in the measurement of cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u00fe \u00de cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u2212 \u00de in the helicity basis, a direct measurement of A measured helicity \u00bc 0.23 AE 0.06 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.07 \u00f0syst\u00de is derived, which is in good agreement with the SM value of A SM helicity \u00bc 0.31. The combined result using cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u00fe \u00de cos\u00f0\u03b8 \u2212 \u00de in the maximal basis gives a direct measurement of A measured maximal \u00bc 0.37 AE 0.06 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.08 \u00f0syst\u00de, in good agreement with the SM value of A SM maximal \u00bc 0.44. The analysis of \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; l\u00de and the S ratio allows an indirect extraction of A under the assumption that the tt sample is composed of top quark pairs as predicted by the SM, either with or without spin correlation, but does not contain contributions beyond the SM. In that case, a change in the fraction f SM will lead to a linear change of A according to Eq. (2). This has been verified in pseudoexperiments. Under these conditions, the measured f SM can be translated into values of A measured basis via Eq. (10), giving A measured helicity \u00bc 0.37 AE 0.03 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.06 \u00f0syst\u00de and A measured maximal \u00bc 0.52 AE 0.04 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.08 \u00f0syst\u00de. These results are limited by systematic uncertainties, in particular by uncertainties due to signal modeling. The influence of the dominant systematic uncertainties in the previous ATLAS measurement performed on a smaller data set (2.1 fb \u22121 ), giving A helicity \u00bc 0.40 \u00fe0.09 \u22120.08 \u00f0stat\u2295syst\u00de [35], has been reduced due to a better model of the fake lepton background and improved understanding of the jet energy scale. The two results are in agreement with each other.",

For the first time, the measurement of tt spin correlation is performed using the S ratio. Also, a direct measurement of the spin correlation strengths A helicity and A maximal is performed using cos \u03b8 \u00fe cos \u03b8 \u2212 in the helicity and maximal bases, respectively. The measurement in the maximal basis is performed for the first time resulting in A measured maximal \u00bc 0.36 AE 0.10 \u00f0stat\u2295syst\u00de. In the dilepton channel, the measurement of tt spin correlation using the azimuthal angle between the charged leptons, \u0394\u03d5, gives f SM \u00bc 1.19AE 0.20 \u00f0stat\u2295syst\u00de.
