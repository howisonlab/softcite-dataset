They are also critical as a reference to ALICE's heavy ion program. The ALICE detector system allows measurements not covered by the other LHC experiments in addition to covering complementary regions. A description of the ALICE detector system, in relation to ATLAS and CMS, are presented. Results from both leptonic and hadronic decay channels will be shown along with comparisons to other measurements when available.",

At LHC energies, all quarks can be produced in the initial interactions between the lead ions, specifically the heavier charm, bottom, and top quarks. The production of hadrons containing these quarks can be measured in protonproton (pp) interactions at equivalent energies. When such quarks or hadrons, created in lead-lead interactions, pass though a QGP their energy and hadronic properties are very likely to be modified by the QGP in ways that can tell us a lot about the properties of the QGP phase of matter.",

For a proper understanding of the results from heavy flavor measurements in lead-lead interactions, good measurements of charm production in pp collisions are necessary, preferably with the same instruments having the same acceptance and other systematics. In addition the production cross sections and decay rates of heavy flavored hadrons are of interest on their own. Here we present the most recent results from the A Large Ion Collider Experiment (AL-ICE) detector on open charm measurements in pp collisions at both \u221a s = 7 and 2.76 TeV.",

To this end, it has very good momentum resolution at very low transverse momentum, as low at 80 MeV/c, and very good particle identification. All of this is achieved by taking advantage of the varied capabilities of the 19 different sub-detector types, but at the cost of a limited acceptance and data taking rate. This is in contrast to the other LHC experiments, which are optimized for other measurements. This results in ALICE contributing measurements uniquely in the low momentum region with a significantly better particle identification capability. In this way the measurements of ATLAS and CMS, both in Pb-Pb and pp interactions, are supplemented by those of ALICE into regions not reachable by ATLAS or CMS.",

For non-\u00b5 events, those taken without the \u00b5\u2212Tracker, the central barrel Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was the primary track, momentum, and particle identification detector. Figure 1 shows the correlation between the ionization of the TPC gas associated with a track and the track's momentum. In addition parts of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) where used both for triggering and particle identification. The ITS is made up of 2 inner cylindrical layers of silicon pixel detectors (SPD), which can also be use for triggering, 2 middle cylindrical layers of silicon drift detectors (SDD), and the 2 outer most cylindrical layers of silicon double sided micro-strip detectors (SSD). Other detectors, such as the Time of Flight (TOF), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), or even the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) where used, primarily for electron/positron identification. See Figures 2 & 3 where signals from the TOF and TRD are shown and the result after removing kaons, protons/ant-protons, and deuterons is seen on the TPC ionization vs momentum correlation plot.",

The \u00b5-minimum bias runs have the same requirement with the addition of a signal in the \u00b5-trigger detector. Van der Meer scans were used to measure the total minimum bias cross section [3]. These cross sections were found to be 62.5 \u00b1 2.2 mb at 7 TeV and 54.8 \u00b1 1.7 mb at 2.76 TeV. The luminosity depends a bit on the specific data selected for analysis and are shown in Figures 5,6,and 8. For analysis in the central barrel, tracks were required to have at least 70 out of 159 measurements in the TPC with a \u03c7 2 /ndf < 2, and at least one good measurement in the ITS SPD of the ITS. In addition, when TOF timings were used for the PID, the best timings require a signal in one of the T0 sub-detectors (or beam-beam crossing time are tried if no T0 signals).",

            "text": "Ratios of particle production rates have the advantage that many systematic uncertainties cancel out and can give some insight to differences in production mechanisms. In addition some particle interactions simulations, like PYTHIA [4], use such ratios as inputs to their production simulations. One such ratio is the ratio between spin 1 mesons to spin 0 mesons for charm and heaver mesons (PYTHIA 6.4.21's PARJ(13)). Given the measurements above we have a measure of the fraction P v of cd D meson production in a vector to those produced in a vector plus pseudoscalar state. We get P v (7 TeV pp) = 0.59 \u00b1 0.06(st) \u00b1 0.08(sy) \u00b10.010(BR) +0.005 \u22120.003 (ex) and P v (2.76 TeV pp) = 0.65 \u00b1 0.10(st) \u00b1 0.08(sy) \u00b10.010(BR) +0.011 \u22120.004 (ex) (uncertainties are from st=statistical, sy=systimatic, BR=branching ratio, and ex=due to extrapolation to full phase space) [10]. These values compare well with those measured by ATLAS at 7 TeV [12], CDF at 1.96 TeV [13], ALEPH at 91.2 GeV [14], and CLEO at 10.55 GeV [15].",

A somewhat more complicated cocktail has been done for sources of electrons (which can also be created by interactions with elements of the ALICE detector).",
