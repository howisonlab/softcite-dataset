The measurement uses a sample of pp collisions recorded by the LHCb experiment during 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 . The D 0 mesons are reconstructed from semileptonic b-hadron decays into D 0 \u00b5 \u2212 X final states. The selected sample contains more than 160 000 signal decays, allowing the most precise amplitude modelling of this D 0 decay to date. The obtained amplitude model is used to perform the search for CP violation. The result is compatible with CP symmetry, with a sensitivity ranging from 1% to 15% depending on the amplitude considered.",

This is, however, not sufficient to describe the cosmological observations when taking into account the estimated lifetime of the universe [2,3].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector JHEP02(2019)126 located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data-taking. The configuration with the magnetic field vertically upwards (downwards) bends positively (negatively) charged particles in the horizontal plane towards the centre of the LHC. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger consisting of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

            "text": "In the offline selection, two kaons and two pions are combined to form a D 0 candidate, which is itself combined with a muon to form a b-hadron candidate. These candidates are required to pass preselection criteria, listed below. The kaons and pions are required to have a momentum larger than 2 GeV/c and a transverse momentum larger than 0.3 GeV/c. The muon is required to have a momentum larger than 3 GeV/c and a transverse momentum larger than 1.2 GeV/c. Requirements on the track quality as well as correct particle identification are also made. The D 0 candidate is required to decay downstream of the b-hadron decay vertex and its mass is required to be in the range [1805,1925] MeV/c 2 . The mass of the b-hadron candidate is required to be in the range [2500, 6000] MeV/c 2 . Furthermore, events are kept only if the positive trigger decision is due to the signal candidate. A boosted decision tree (BDT) [27,28] is used to separate signal from background. The description of the signal is taken from simulation while that of the background is taken from the D 0 -mass sidebands in data. The two datasets are split into two independent subsamples for the training and the testing of the classifier. Many kinematic and isolation variables are tested, the set of variables being gradually reduced until the performance of the BDT starts to decrease significantly. The final set of variables used in this analysis contains the mass of the b hadron corrected for the missing particles [29], the flight distance of the D 0 candidate, the vertex-fit \u03c7 2 of the decay vertex of the D 0 candidate, particle identification information of the four daughters of the D 0 candidate, the probability of the tracks being reconstructed from random hits [17], and isolation variables based on the underlying event. One isolation variable is obtained by considering all tracks inside a cone around the D 0 direction and computing the p T asymmetry with respect to the D 0 meson. Two additional isolation variables are obtained by adding tracks to the D 0 vertex; the first represents the invariant mass of the new combination when adding the track with the minimum vertex \u03c7 2 difference and the second represents the minimum \u03c7 2 difference when adding two tracks. The selection on the BDT outcome is chosen to maximise the figure",

            "text": "There are a couple of sources of systematic uncertainty related to the background description: the finite size of the D 0 sidebands that are used as a proxy, and the technique to describe the background itself. In the first case, the fit is repeated many times with alternative descriptions of the background obtained by resampling the sidebands using a bootstrapping technique [47]. In the second case, an alternative technique is used for the weighting of the simulated sample to match the sidebands. This technique determines the weights by considering seven subsets of the 31 variables defined in section 4.3. The weighting is performed in turn using each subset, assuming that the variables in that subset are independent. The correlations are taken into account by iterating until the matching is satisfactory. The systematic uncertainties are taken from the differences with respect to the nominal fit.",

To check how likely such a deviation would be in absence of CP violation, the fit is repeated many times, where the data is randomly split instead of splitting it according to the flavour of the D candidate. The largest deviation among all the asymmetry parameters exceeds 2.8\u03c3 in 35% of the fits, confirming that the deviation observed in the CP -violation fit is not significant.",

At this level of sensitivity, no effect of CP violation is found. This is expected from SM predictions [4] and large effects from beyond the SM processes are ruled out. It is interesting to report that most of the systematic uncertainties of the CP -averaged fit are marginally affecting the CP -violation fit, resulting in a much smaller systematic uncertainty. Finally, the systematic uncertainties of the CPviolation measurements are expected to scale down with luminosity, since most of them are estimated with inputs from data.  ",
