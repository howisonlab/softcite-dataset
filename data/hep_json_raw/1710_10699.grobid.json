Single top-quark production in the t-channel process has been measured at both colliders. The s-channel process has been observed at the Tevatron, and its rate has been also measured at the centerof-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC in spite of the comparatively harsher background contamination. LHC data also brought the observation of the associated production of a single top quark with a W boson as well as with a Z boson. The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V tb | is extracted from the single-top-quark production cross sections, and t-channel events are used to measure several properties of the top quark and set constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model. Rare final states with a single top quark are searched for, as enhancements in their production rates, if observed, would be clear signs of new physics.",

That a decay mediated by a weak interaction may be faster than a process mediated by the strong interaction is at first sight surprising; intuitively, this is due to the fact that the top-quark mass is larger than the sum of the W and b masses, therefore there is no barrier to overcome and we have a two-body decay t \u2192 W b with a real W boson, instead of the usual three-body decay mediated by a virtual W boson.

While the pair-production process was discovered more than twenty years ago (Abachi et al., 1995;Abe et al., 1995) and entered the domain of precision physics many years ago, single top-quark production has been observed less than a decade ago at the Tevatron (Aaltonen et al., 2009a;Abazov et al., 2009). In comparison to tt production, the single top-quark signal is small and difficult to separate from the backgrounds (including tt itself), hence the measurement precision for its cross sections and other properties has generally been relatively modest until recently.",

Precise measurements of single top-quark cross sections are motivated by their sensitivity to new physics that modifies either the production or the decay vertex or both (Aguilar-Saavedra, 2009a). The single top-quark production cross section under the SM assumptions is proportional to the square of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) (Cabibbo, 1963;Kobayashi and Maskawa, 1973) matrix element V tb (Alwall et al., 2007;Lacker et al., 2012). The three most abundant and most studied single top-quark processes are illustrated at Born level in Fig. 1. Their production cross sections differ between the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider and the LHC proton-proton collider. The t-channel process proceeds through the exchange of a W boson between a light-quark line and a heavy-quark line and has the largest production cross section at both colliders. The s-channel process is the production and decay of a heavy off-shell W boson.",

The former promptly decays either into a charged lepton and a neutrino, or into a light quark-antiquark pair. The presence of an isolated electron or muon, in particular, is used as a selection requirement in almost all single top-quark production studies, as those two particles are particularly easy to identify with large efficiency and low background contamination even in the busy particle environment created by hadron-hadron collisions. The neutrino is undetectable because of its negligible cross section of interaction with the detector material. But the large momentum that it carries, being boosted by the decay of the massive W boson, which is in turn boosted by the decay of the even more massive top quark, is conspicuous by its absence: the large momentum imbalance of the system formed by all visible particles can be used to reconstruct the neutrino momentum. At hadron colliders, this quantity is meaningful only in the plane transverse to the beam directions (the fraction of proton or antiproton momentum carried by the interacting quarks or gluons is only known on a statistical basis via their PDF), and therefore it is customary to define a missing transverse momentum or missing transverse energy (E / T ). The jets from b-quark hadronization can be separated on a statistical basis from those originating from lighter quarks (i.e., those jets can be \"b-tagged\"). The heavier a quark is, the more asymmetric is the sharing of energy among the hadronization products (Bjorken, 1978); in particular, a b-flavored hadron carries about 70% of the original momentum of the corresponding b quark (Abbiendi et al., 2003;Abdallah et al., 2011;Abe et al., 2002;Heister et al., 2001). The long lifetime of this bflavored hadron (10 \u221212 s) corresponds to a flight distance of the order of millimeters, which can be measured in the detectors. Charged leptons, E / T and b-tagged jets are among the telltale signs of the presence of top quarks in a collision event; to further identify the production mechanism, the presence or absence of accompanying objects is crucially exploited, as we will show in the following sections. The single top-quark signal is further separated from the backgrounds through the use of multi-variate analysis (MVA) algorithms that combine kinematic properties of the reconstructed objects into a powerful discriminant.",

The different initial states lead to different production processes: At the Tevatron, hard-scale processes (including all top-quark production mechanisms or processes involving the exchange of massive mediators) are dominated by quark-antiquark initial states, while at the LHC they are dominated by initial states with one or two gluons. In addition, the LHC has accumulated large amounts of proton-proton (pp) collision data at three different CM energies, 7 TeV, 8 TeV, and 13 TeV, while the Tevatron accumulated a large amount of proton-antiproton data at 1.96 TeV. The Tevatron initially collected data at 1.8 TeV, with sufficient statistics to discover the top quark in pair production (Abachi et al., 1995;Abe et al., 1995), but insufficient to measure single top-quark production (Abbott et al., 2000;Acosta et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The algorithms for the identification and reconstruction of the so-called analysis objects (e.g., electrons, muons, hadronic jets) are similar though not identical at the different experiments, reflecting their complementary strengths. The focus in single top-quark selections is on identifying isolated high-p T electrons or muons together with large E / T and one or more jets, at least one of which is required to be b-tagged to identify the b quark from the top-quark decay. The Tevatron experiments, CDF and D0, use two different jet reconstruction algorithms with different cone sizes. The LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS use the same anti-k T algorithm (Salam and Soyez, 2007), though during Run 1 different radius parameters were used. The p T thresholds for leptons and jets at the Tevatron are typically lower (15 GeV to 20 GeV) than at the LHC (20 GeV to 30 GeV), giving higher acceptances for single top-quark events, compensated partially by the harder spectrum caused by the larger CM energies at the LHC. All b-tagging algorithms in these four experiments exploit information related to the lifetime of the b-flavored hadrons, in many cases combined with complementary information such as the mass and track multiplicity of the secondary vertices (when present) and/or by the observation of charged leptons inside the jet. The b-tagging efficiencies, for similar light-quark rejection factors, are smaller at the Tevatron (50% to 65%) (Abazov et al., 2014;Acosta et al., 2005b) compared to the LHC (65% to 85%) (ATLAS Collaboration, 2016c; CMS Collaboration, 2013b).",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in CMS Collaboration (2008). Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system (CMS Collaboration, 2017i). The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to less than 1 kHz before data storage.",

At the Tevatron, the distribution is asymmetric due to the proton-antiproton initial state. The light quark that recoils against the top quark (antiquark), often called \"spectator\" quark, goes preferentially along the direction of the incoming proton (antiproton). At the LHC, the pseudorapidity distribution is symmetric, thus only |\u03b7| is shown. For the same reason, the cross sections for the production of top quarks and antiquarks are different. The light quark distribution peaks more forward at the LHC than at the Tevatron due to the larger CM energy, and more forward for top quarks than top antiquarks because the incoming light quark is a valence quark for top-quark production.",

And not just MVAs, but the discovery sensitivity is only reached when multiple MVAs are combined in another MVA. Figure 3 shows the discriminant distributions in the two CDF analyses that enter the observation: The super discriminant, from a combination of multiple l+jets analyses, and the MVA discriminant from the E / T +jets (MJ) analysis which vetoes isolated leptons (Aaltonen et al., 2010). The super discriminant only has a single bin with more than 5 signal events expected, and the MJ discriminant also has very few signal events in the signal-enriched region. Figure 4 shows the combination discriminant for the D0 analysis. Even in the signal-enriched region close to an MVA output of 1, there are only about 8 expected signal events for an expected background of about 10 events. The combined cross section for t-channel and s-channel production is obtained in a Bayesian likelihood analysis, assuming the SM ratio of the two processes. The same approach is also used to combine the two measurements, and the combined t-channel plus s-channel (t + s) cross section is 2.76 +0.58 \u22120.47 pb (CDF and D0 Collaborations, Tevatron Electroweak Working Group, 2009).",

The data events are separated into four categories by jet multiplicity (2-jet and 3-jet) and b-tag multiplicity (1-tag and 2-tag). The single top-quark signal is separated from the backgrounds using a Neural Network (NN) discriminant, trained separately in each analysis region, using only s-channel events as the signal in the training for 2-jet, 2-tag events, and only t-channel events as the signal in the training for all other events. This dedicated training enhances the separate sensitivity to s-channel and t-channel. In addition, simulated samples with variations related to the main systematic uncertainties (jet energy scale, factorization and renormalization scales) are included in the training in order to reduce the sensitivity to these sources of uncertainty.

The various channels of the different analyses are combined by taking the product of their likelihoods and simultaneously varying the correlated uncertainties and by comparing data to the predictions for each contributing signal and background process. The combined Tevatron cross sections are measured using a Bayesian statistical analysis (Bertram et al., 2000). No assumption is made about the ratio of the t-channel and The two-dimensional Bayesian posterior density as a function of the t-channel and schannel cross sections is shown in Fig. 10(left). The measurement agrees with the SM prediction and is also compared to several new physics models for illustration. FCNC couplings of the top quark to the gluon (Abazov et al., 2007b;Tait and Yuan, 2000) increase the t-channel cross section. A possible fourth generation (Alwall et al., 2007) results in an increased topquark coupling to first-and second-generation quarks and thus reduces the s-channel cross section while increasing the t-channel cross section. A top-flavor model (He et al., 2000;Tait and Yuan, 2000) with an additional boson coupling to the top quark increases the s-channel cross section and has no impact on t-channel production. A charged \"top pion\" 6 results in a s-channel resonance decaying to a top quark and a bottom quark (Tait and Yuan, 2000).",

The input measurements and procedure are the same as described in Section III.A.3, but here, the likelihood fit is one-dimensional for the s-channel signal, including t-channel single topquark production in the background. The combined discriminant, rebinned to bring out the s-channel signal, is shown in Fig. 11(left). The dominant background in the signal region is from W +jets production and top-quark pair production. The t-channel contribution in the s-channel signal region is negligible. 6 The term \"top pion\" refers to hypothetical composite bosons formed by top and bottom quarks and antiquarks, predicted in models with additional strong interactions that only act on third-generation quarks, generally known as \"top-color\" models (Hill, 1991(Hill, , 1995. These models seek to explain the largeness of the top-quark mass by a top-quark condensation that plays the role of the Higgs field, in analogy with the phenomenon of superconductivity. Top pions play for such a theory the same role that the SM pions, formed by up and down quarks and antiquarks, play in QCD.",

All these analyses enhance the t-channel signal by selecting events with one isolated electron or muon, significant E / T and/or large invariant mass (m W T ) of the lepton plus E / T system 7 , and two or three jets. Exactly one of the jets is required to pass a tight threshold on the b-tagging discriminant and is interpreted as coming from the decay of the top quark, while the other (failing the same threshold) as originating from the spectator quark that recoils again the top quark. Main backgrounds to this final state are tt and W +jets. Orthogonal control regions with different multiplicities of jets and/or b-tagged jets are used to measure these backgrounds in situ, to validate the Monte Carlo models used for their predictions, or to constrain the main experimental uncertainties (e.g., b-tag modeling). QCD multi-jet events constitute a small but non-negligible background. Given the uncertainties in its modeling, it is necessary to predict the size and properties of this process by data. A reliable model of this background is usually extracted from events that fail the isolation requirement or other elements of the charged-lepton selection, while fulfilling all other selection criteria.",

The CMS measurement is a combination of the electron and muon channels, both of which have a tight event selection that leads to a high s/b ratio, see Table II, resulting in a slightly smaller total uncertainty for CMS than for ATLAS. The cross sections measured by ATLAS and CMS are consistent with each other and with the theory predictions. A fiducial t-channel cross section has been measured by the ATLAS collaboration using the 8 TeV data set (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017b). The benefit of measuring a production cross section within a fiducial volume is that uncertainties related to event generation can be reduced, as a smaller extrapolation is needed between the reconstruction level and the particle level (unobservable regions of the phase become numerically irrelevant). Differences between generators, hadronization models or PDFs can be separated into components visible in the measured phase space (similar between particle level and reconstruction level) and in the non-visible phase space (where there would be larger differences between particle level and reconstruction level). The fiducial phase space for this analysis is defined close to that of the reconstructed and selected events. The particle-level objects are constructed from stable particles in the final state, with a very similar definition to the reconstructed objects, in order to minimize the sensitivity of the fiducial cross section to the signal modeling. The fiducial measurement is then extrapolated to the full phase space using different Monte Carlo generators, obtaining the spread of results shown in ",

The NLO+NNLL calculation is based on a NLO tW calculation (Zhu, 2002) that removes the interference terms at the cross-section level. The MCFM calculation introduces a cut-off on the transverse momentum of the b-quark from gluon splitting, and the cross section is somewhat sensitive to this threshold.

This includes the parton shower and ISR/FSR and other generator modeling uncertainties. The DR/DS uncertainty is not constrained in the fit but is also not a large uncertainty contribution. obtained by comparing tW and tt samples generated with POWHEG (Frixione et al., 2007) with those generated with MC@NLO (Frixione and Webber, 2002) Differential measurements of the tW cross section have also been reported as a function of the energy and invariant mass of different combinations of final-state objects by ATLAS at 13 TeV (ATLAS Collaboration, 2018a). The kinematic distributions are unfolded to the particle level (defined by the presence of one lepton and one b-quark jet) and are compared to different MC simulations. This first differential measurement shows some conflict with the different MC generators, which all have about the same level of agreement with the data, as can be seen in the distribution of the energy of the b quark from the top-quark decay in Fig. 17(right).",

This signal definition encompasses not only tW production but also tt production where one of the final-state b quarks is outside of the acceptance. The result is shown in Fig. 18 and is found to be in agreement with the predictions from two different NLO matrix-element generators (POWHEG and MC@NLO) matched to two different parton-shower generators (Pythia 6 (Sj\u00f6strand et al., 2006) and Herwig 6 (Corcella et al., 2001)), the DR and DS approaches, and a variety of PDF sets. In this comparison, where the relative normalization of tW and tt is important, the measurement has the best compatibility with the simulation when tW is normalized to the NLO+NNLL calculation and tt is normalized to the NNLO+NNLL calculation. In particular the tt normalization plays an important role. While no conclusion about individual generators can be drawn given the size of the uncertainties, it is clear that in the fiducial measurement, POWHEG predicts a lower cross section than MC@NLO, when both are interfaced to Herwig.",

Using samples of 1.0 and 2.0 fb \u22121 collected at CM energies of 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012 respectively, the LHCb Collaboration (2015) achieved the first observation of top-quark production in the forward region defined by its acceptance to muons (2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5) and to b jets (2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.2), see Fig. 19.

Summary of the inclusive cross-section measurements Figure 24 summarizes all of the experimental measurements of the inclusive cross sections for single top-quark production at the Tevatron and at the LHC. The measurements are compared to the NLO+NNLL predictions for t-channel, tW and s-channel, and to a NLO calculation with MC@NLO for tZq, using the NNPDF3.0 PDF set (Ball et al., 2015). As another example, a vector-like fourth-generation quark B with a mass of 0.8 TeV and chromo-magnetic couplings (Nutter et al., 2012) modifies the tW production cross section but only has a negligible impact on t-channel and s-channel production. A color triplet with a mass of 1 TeV decays to tb and thus enhances the s-channel cross section but has no effect on t-channel or tW . And finally, a small FCNC interaction corresponding to a branching ratio of 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for t \u2192 gc (Aguilar-Saavedra, 2009a) increases the t-channel cross section but has no impact on tW or s-channel. It should be noted that for all of these examples, a proper evaluation of the sensitivity includes not just the modification of the cross section but also of the experimental acceptance. In particular, since the experimental analyses use MVA techniques, the sensitivity is mainly to SM-like production mechanisms. Dedicated searches, such as those presented in the next sections, are generally more sensitive for each possible BSM scenario.",

The latter includes W -boson charge ratios in the fit, while the single top-quark charge ratio in the t-channel is used as a \"standard candle\" to validate the predictions of their PDF set 9 . However, this picture became inconsistent with the later publication of the most precise R t result in the literature, which is the ATLAS measurement at 8 TeV: this yields smaller values than most PDF sets, and is in tension with most of the PDF set predictions for this observable, as shown in Fig. 27, while the aforementioned ATLAS and CMS measurements at 7 and 8 TeV both yield larger values than most PDF sets. The small uncertainty of the ATLAS measurement highlights the value of time in hadron collider analyses. The ATLAS analysis was published almost three years after the CMS analysis, and that time was used to improve the detector understanding and theory modeling, and to devise an optimal analysis strategy. Rather than obtaining R t from the ratio of measured cross sections, ATLAS extracts R t in one simultaneous fit to the top quark and antiquark cross sections. This directly accounts for all correlations, including those between the two analysis regions and those between different systematic uncertainties that are induced in the fit.",

A BNN is trained to separate the anomalous signal from the different backgrounds and the SM prediction. The resulting contours projected onto two dimensions are shown in Fig. 31.

These are very interesting to look for in single top-quark production, where the effect of a small u \u2212 t coupling would be enhanced by the large u-quark density (Tait and Yuan, 2000). The same effect would come from a c \u2212 t coupling, although with a less spectacular enhancement from the PDF. Formulations exist where BSM effects in quantum loops are absorbed by effective tuX or tcX couplings, where X can be a gluon, a photon, a Z or H boson (read, for example, Aguilar-Saavedra (2009a) and Zhang and Willenbrock (2011)). Based on the consideration that higher-order effects mix the effects of different couplings, inducing ambiguities in the interpretation of single signatures, a global approach is advocated in Barducci et al.

In spite of a conventional wisdom that, at the time, favored simple cut-and-count methods in the searches for new processes in hadron-hadron collisions, the challenges posed by the search for single top-quark production at Tevatron created a strong incentive for practicing machine-learning methods such as Neural Networks and Boosted Decision Trees, that at the time of writing count among the most popular tools for LHC analysis, and the ME method that had been developed for top-quark physics (Kondo, 1988(Kondo, , 1991, although applied until then for different use cases such as top-quark mass measurements. We are currently witnessing a burst of interest in borrowing even more advanced machine-learning techniques from the larger world outside of High Energy Physics (Cowan et al., 2015), and it is likely that single top-quark analyses, again, will be among the early adopters. With regard to the ME method, a recent methodological break-through has been the inclusion of NLO Feynman diagrams in the computation of the dynamical likelihoods Uwer, 2015, 2017a,b), overcoming the computational challenge by an efficient method to calculate NLO QCD weights for events with jets. This development is expected to reduce the biases in analyses that aim at extracting model parameters, and to improve the sensitivity of the searches for new processes. Martini and Uwer (2017b) specifically address the interest of this development in the context of single top-quark studies.",

Recently, top-quark pair production has been observed in proton-lead collisions at \u221a s N N = 8.16 TeV (CMS Collaboration, 2017e), and it is expected that single top-quark measurements will also join the physics program with future heavy-ion runs at the LHC (Baskakov et al., 2015;d'Enterria et al., 2015). The single top-quark production cross section increases by a factor 30 to 40 for heavy ion runs at a possible future circular collider (d 'Enterria, 2017), which turns single top-quark events into precise probes. These and tt events will serve as a probe for parton density functions in nuclei at small x B and large momentum transfer (Dainese et al., 2017).",

The focus will be on high-precision measurements of the top-quark mass and of the top-quark couplings to the Z boson and the photon (Agashe et al., 2013;Baer et al., 2013;Bicer et al., 2014). Single top-quark production proceeds in an electron-photon collision, with one incoming lepton radiating off a photon and the other incoming lepton radiating off a W boson, resulting dominantly in a final state of a top quark plus a b quark plus a forward lepton (Boos and Dudko, 2012;Penunuri et al., 2011). The cross section for this process is about an order of magnitude smaller than that for tt production. Similar to hadron colliders, single top-quark production at lepton colliders is directly proportional to |V tb | and the |V tb | precision is limited by the theoretical and experimental understanding of the production process.",

The distribution of the number of reconstructed jets in the ATLAS 7 TeV analysis, shown inFig. 16, shows that even in the signal region with one jet, the tW signal is overwhelmed by a larger background from tt production where one of the two b-quark jets is not reconstructed. Measurements of this process in the l+jets final state, i.e., with one W boson decaying leptonically and one hadronically, suffer from the combinatorial problem of quark-parton association and from the difficulty of discriminating the signal from the overwhelming tt background(CMS   Collaboration, 2007;Giorgi, 2016). A measurement in the l+jets channel, however, would have the added value that the top quark/antiquark ratio would become accessible 8 and could be used as a handle to constrain |V td |, as an initial-state d-quark parton makes this ratio deviate from unity (Alvarez et al., 2018).The distributions of multivariate discriminants are used in a likelihood fit to extract the signal cross section. The fit utilizes multiple regions: Not only 1-jet, 1 b-tag events that have the largest fraction of tW signal, seeFig. 16(left), but also 2-jet events with 1 or 2 b-tags, which are used to constrain the dominant background from tt production and the large systematic uncertainties.

The tW signal appears at high discriminant values, with a s/b ratio approaching 1/1.

Several orthogonal control regions with different multiplicities of jets and/or b-tagged jets are used to measure these backgrounds in situ or to validate the Monte Carlo models used for their predictions, or to constrain the main experimental systematics (e.g., b-tagging efficiency).With the 7 TeV dataset, ATLAS and CMS were not able to observe the s-channel process and only set upper limits on its production cross section (ATLAS Collaborations, 2011; CMS Collaboration, 2016f). With the 8 TeV dataset, ATLAS first published a search (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015c), and then improved the sensitivity of the analysis to report evidence for s-channel single top-quark production (ATLAS Collaboration, 2016a). The latter analysis employs a matrix element (ME) method (see Section III.A.2) to optimize the sensitivity to the s-channel signal. Here, the likelihood for each event to originate from the signal or one of the backgrounds is computed based on the four-vectors of the particles in the corresponding LO Feynman diagrams. Un-observed four-vector components and detector resolution effects are integrated over, resulting in large computing-time requirements. The final ME discriminant for the ATLAS s-channel analysis is shown inFig. 20(left). The background is subtracted from the data in this figure, making the otherwise small signal visible. CMS mea-sured the cross section simultaneously at 7 and 8 TeV (CMS Collaboration, 2016f), taking advantage of the correlations between the different CM energies to constrain backgrounds and systematic uncertainties. The signal is separated from the large backgrounds using a BDT discriminant, which is shown inFig. 20(right), with the small s-channel signal visible on the right-hand side of the distribution. The s-channel analyses are limited by large backgrounds in the signal region, in particular from tt as Fig. 20 shows. The bins with the largest signal fraction correspond to unusual phase-space regions for the largest backgrounds, thus very large amounts of simulated events are necessary for the analysis. The MC statistics uncertainty is the largest of all systematic uncertainties. For both the ATLAS and CMS analyses, large detector-related uncertainties arise from JES and b-tag modeling, and the theory modeling uncertainties are dominated by t-channel and tt modeling uncertainties. At 7 TeV, the limit set by ATLAS on the s-channel cross section is 26.5 pb (20.5 pb expected). The limit set by CMS is 31.4 pb (20.2 pb expected). At 8 TeV, ATLAS reported evidence with an observed (expected) significance of 3.2 (3.9) standard deviations. The measured cross section is 4.8\u00b11.8 pb. The CMS limit at 8 TeV is 28.8 pb (15.6 pb expected).",

If the CKM matrix is not unitary, then deviations from 1 are possible for V tb , and in turn, large non-zero values are possible for V td and V ts(Alwall et al., 2007). Here, we calculate the corrections to the single top-quark cross sections for a value of V ts = 0.2, keeping V td = 0 and thus setting V tb = 0.98.

From these data, and with some model assumptions such as the existence of only three generations of quarks and the absence of non-SM particles in the loops(Alwall et al., 2007), the value of |V tb | is derived with a precision of order 10 \u22125 : |V tb | = 0.999097 \u00b1 0.000024(Patrignani et al., 2016). The strong reliance of this derivation on the aforementioned assumptions motivates alternative inferences based on different sets of hypotheses. There is interest, for example, in exploring the possibility that a hypothetical heavier quark-like particle, such as a fourth-generation up-type quark or a heavy vector-like quark (Aguilar-Saavedra et al., 2013) (both named t in the following) mixes with the top quark, yielding a lower value of |V tb | than expected from 3 \u00d7 3 unitarity. Mixing may happen not only with sequential replicas of the known quarks, easily accommodated in the SM framework but severely constrained by the Higgs cross section measurements(Lenz, 2013)), but in general with any hypothetical quark-like particle with the appropriate quantum numbers. Differently from the new-generations case, the effective mixing matrix may be rectangular, as in the case of vector-like quarks (Aguilar-Saavedra et al., 2013; Okada and Panizzi, 2013",

While MC@NLO is more disfavored in the fit, both need improving.

The experimental signature consists of a leptonically decaying top-quark, with a central high-p T b quark, and a forward light quark, plus a leptonically decaying Z boson. The main backgrounds are W Z+jets (instead of W +jets), Z+jets with a jet mis-identified as an isolated lepton (instead of multi-jets with a mis-identified lepton), and ttZ (instead of tt). The requirement of the presence of the Z boson reduces the event rates for all of these processes by three orders of magnitude compared to Section III.B.1. In addition, the requirement of a leptonically decaying Z boson reduces the rate by about another order of magnitude. Selecting events in a narrow region around the Z boson mass peak is important to effectively reject non-Z backgrounds, and this is not viable for hadronically decaying Z bosons, for which there is an overwhelmingly large QCD background. Final states with hadronically decaying top quarks and leptonically decaying Z bosons is similarly challenging, analogous to t-channel production, where hadronic top quark decays are also overwhelmed by a large QCD background.",

At the Tevatron, the CKM matrix element |V tb | is extracted from the s + t cross section measurement, obtaining |f L \u2022 V tb | = 1.02 +0.06 \u22120.05 , corresponding to a lower limit at the 95% confidence level of |V tb | > 0.92 (CDF and D0 Collaborations, Tevatron Electroweak Working Group, 2009). particularly tricky case for the reinterpretation is that single top-quark analyses are based on multivariate techniques. The MVA input variables are related to the kinematic properties of the reconstructed top quark and the event, which would be modified in production through |V ts | or |V td |, thus modifying the acceptance. Moreover, the jet coming from the top-quark decay is assumed to be a b-jet, thus |V tb | 2 |V td | 2 + |V ts | 2 is assumed. (Aguilar-Saavedra and Onofre, 2011) propose to use the rapidity of the single top quark and antiquark in t-channel and tW production modes to set direct limits on |V td |. Similarly, in Alvarez et al.(2018), it is proposed to use the integrated charge asymmetry in tW to extract |V td |. Both methods rely on the consideration that b-quark-initiated tW production,Fig. 1, has exactly the same kinematic properties and rate whether the initiator quark is a b or",

Under these conditions, theproduct |f L \u2022 Vtb | is extracted by dividing the measured cross section for each channel by the corresponding theory prediction and then taking the square root. The factor f L is the form factor for the purely left-handed vector tW b coupling, see Eq. 2. It is unity in the SM but could be larger than unity if anomalous couplings due to new physics are present. It is customary to also quote the 95% confidence level interval obtained by setting f L = 1, i.e. with the additional unitarity constraint 0 \u2264 |V tb | \u2264 1. The procedure outlined so far ignores the possibility that the tW b coupling may receive contributions from right-handed or nonvectorial operators that are instead usually considered in studies such as those reported in Section IV.D. Aguilar-Saavedra and Onofre (2011); Alwall et al. (2007); and Lacker et al.
