The measurement of the forward neutral particle spectra produced in proton-proton collisions at LHC up to an energy of 14 TeV in the center of mass system are of fundamental importance to calibrate the Monte Carlo models widely used in the high energy cosmic ray (HECR) field, up to an equivalent laboratory energy of the order of 10 17 eV. In this paper the first results on the inclusive photon spectrum measured by LHCf is reported. Comparison of this spectrum with the model expectations show significant discrepancies, mainly in the high energy region. In addition, perspectives for future analyses as well as the program for the next data taking period, in particular the possibility to take data in p-Pb collisions, will be discussed.",

            "text": "The LHCf experiment at LHC has been designed to calibrate the hadron interaction models used in High Energy Cosmic Ray (HECR) Physics through the measurement of the forward neutral particle produced in p-p interactions. The uncertainty caused by the poor knowledge of the interaction between very high energy primary cosmic rays and the earth's atmosphere prevents the precise deduction of astrophysical parameters from the observational data, thus causing the most important source of systematic error in HECR dedicated experiments. Dedicated extensive air shower experiments are in place since many years and have strongly contributed to our understanding of High and Ultra High Energy Cosmic (UHECR) Ray Physics. Recently, in particular, the Pierre Auger Collaboration [1] and the Telescope Array Collaboration [2], thanks to the excellent performance of their hybrid detector arrays, are providing us new exciting observations of UHECRs. Although these recent results have brought a deeper insight in primary cosmic ray properties, still they are largely affected by the poor knowledge of the nuclear interactions in the earth's atmosphere. A calibration of the energy scale in the 10 15 \u00f7 10 17 eV energy range accessible to LHC provides crucial input for a better interpretation of primary cosmic ray properties, in the region between the \"knee\" and the GZK cut-off.",

In order to correct for these last two effects, which are rather important due to the limited transverse size of both the calorimetric towers, the transverse impact position of showers provided by the position sensitive detectors is used. Event produced by neutral hadrons are rejected using the information about the longitudinal development of the showers, which is different for electromagnetic and hadronic particles. In addition, thanks to the information provided by the position sensitive detectors, events with more than one shower inside the same tower (multi-hit) are rejected. In order to combine the spectra measured by ARM1 and ARM2, which have different geometrical configurations, in this analysis only events detected in a common pseudorapidity and azimuthal range are selected: \u03b7 > 10.94 and \u2206\u03c6 = 360 o for the small towers and 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99 and \u2206\u03c6 = 20 o for the large towers. Figure 1 shows the single \u03b3 spectrum measured by LHCf in the two pseudorapidity regions compared with results predicted by MC simulations using different models: DPMJET III-3.04 [5], QGSJET II-03 [6], SIBYLL 2.1 [7], EPOS 1.9 [8] and PYTHIA 8.145 [9]. Statical errors and systematic uncertainties are also plotted. A careful study of systematic uncertainties has been done and conservative estimates have been taken into account. Further details can be found in Ref. [4]. As can be seen from Fig. 1, a clear discrepancy between the experimental results and the predictions of the models in the whole energy region is present.",

Anyway the study of the very forward interactions in the pp system does not allow to have a complete picture of hadronic interactions in atmosphere, where mainly nitrogen and oxygen nuclei are involved, since the effect of the medium can not be neglected if precise estimations are requested. The LHCf original physics performances can hence be nicely improved by including measurements of the particles very forward produced in the proton-Nuclei (pA) collisions. In principle the ideal way would be to perform the measurement of proton interactions with nitrogen or oxygen nuclei. This is not possible at the moment neither at the LHC nor at other facilities, at least for TeV energies. The LHC though, has instead the unique possibility to study the nuclear effects in the forward region of the collisions between protons and Lead nuclei at the TeV scale, corresponding to a proton energy in the LAB frame exceeding 10 16 eV. Previous measurements done at other facilities [11] reported a marked reduction of the production cross section values for low transverse momentum events in the forward region of ion interactions, with respect to what could be expected by considering the events as binary collisions between nucleons. These results, normally reported as the ratio between cross sections measured in p-ion (or ion-ion) and in pp collisions (that is the Nuclear Modification Factor, NMF), are currently explained with nucleon screening effects and saturation of partonic densities, but so far we have only a poor knowledge of the mechanisms involved, especially at very high rapidity where no measurements currently exist.",

Some interesting results are shown in the last part of this section, based on the simulations performed using EPICS and DPMJET-III hadronic interaction models to describe the proton-Lead collisions. A total of 10 7 events have been generated for each model, considering a 3.5 TeV proton hitting a 1.38 TeV/nucleon Lead ion with a null crossing angle and random impact parameter. The total energy in the nucleon-nucleon center of mass frame is approximately 4.4 TeV. The most significant results are obtained by measuring particles produced in the proton remnant side, that is more simply accessible from the experimental point of view; in this region smaller multiplicity of neutral particles are expected, as can be seen from Fig. 4, that reports the expected number of photons and neutrons hitting both the Arm2 towers.",

            "text": "Approximately 1% of the events have one single hit, and less than a fraction of 10 \u22125 of the events have two hits on a single tower. Therefore we do not expect particular problems both during data taking and analysis phases. Additionally, we want to stress that the absolute energy scale can be directly checked also in the p-Pb run with the data by the direct \u03c0 0 reconstruction method, by separately identifying the two photons of the \u03c0 0 decay in the two separate towers, as has already been demonstrated with the 7 TeV pp data [13]. Figure 5 shows the expected photon spectra in the small (top) and large (bottom) tower, as obtained with the EPICS and DPMJET-III models, for 10 7 inelastic p-Pb collisions. A clear and significant difference between the two models can be seen from this figure. In particular we find that the DPMJET-III model has a harder spectra than the EPOS model. The difference in the slopes is evident and LHCf will easily discriminate between the two models.",

As can be seen from Fig. 6 the reconstruction of type II \u03c0 0 events gives the possibility to explore a different p T region: while type I events are mainly characterised by pair of photons with large opening angle and dominates at low energies, type II \u03c0 0 events are characterized by tight photon opening angles and dominates at higher energies. The combination of type I and type II reconstruction thus enlarges our physics acceptance. In the meantime, the LHCf Collaboration is also working on the upgrade of the detector to improve the radiation resistance in view of the 14 TeV p-p run, currently foreseen in 2014. The scintillating part of the detector will be replaced with GSO slabs. Beam test results [14] have demonstrated that the upgrade of the calorimeter with GSO will enable LHCf to sustain the radiation level foreseen in the 14 TeV run. Additional improvements in the frontend electronics of the silicon position sensitive layers of ARM2 detectors as well as an optimization of the layout to improve the stand-alone silicon energy resolution are on going.",
