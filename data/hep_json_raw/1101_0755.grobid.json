            "text": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) in charged lepton decays is forbidden in the Standard Model (SM) and remains highly suppressed even if the SM is modified to include neutrino mixing. However, extensions of the SM, such as supersymmetry, leptoquark and many other models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] predict LFV with branching fractions as high as 10 \u22128 , which could already be accessible in current B-factory experiments. We search for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 V 0 decays [ \u2020], where \u2113 is an electron or muon and V 0 is one of the vector mesons \u03c1 0 , \u03c6, \u03c9, K * 0 orK * 0 . These results are based on the entire 854 fb \u22121 data sample collected at center-of-mass (CM) energies near the \u03a5(4S), near the \u03a5(5S), and off resonance with the Belle detector [8] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [9]. Previously, we obtained 90% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits on branching fractions of these decays using 543 fb \u22121 of data; the results were in the range (5.8\u221218) \u00d7 10 \u22128 [10]. The results described here use additional data and an improved event selection procedure, which is optimized mode-by-mode. The BaBar collaboration has also published 90% C.L. upper limits in the range (2.6\u221219) \u00d7 10 \u22128 using 451 fb \u22121 of data [11] for all \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 V 0 decays except for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 \u03c9 for which 384 fb \u22121 of data were used [12].",

For the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113\u03c9 modes, we select \u03c0 0 (\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) candidates on the signal side by requiring E \u03b3 > 0.1 GeV and p \u03c0 0 > 0.4 GeV/c, which suppresses incorrectly reconstructed \u03c0 0 candidates from initial-state radiation (ISR) and beam background. The \u03c0 0 mass window is 0.12 GeV/c 2 < M \u03b3\u03b3 < 0.15 GeV/c 2 . To ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that pass outside the detector acceptance, we impose requirements on the missing momentum p miss , which is calculated by subtracting the vector sum of the momenta of all tracks and photons from the sum of the e + and e \u2212 beam momenta. We require that |p t miss |, the magnitude of the transverse component of p miss , be greater than 0.5 GeV/c (0.7 GeV/c) for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5V 0 (eV 0 except the e\u03c1 0 ) modes, and that p miss point into the fiducial volume of the detector. For the \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03c1 0 mode only, we apply the more restrictive selection requirement |p t miss | > 1.5 GeV/c. Furthermore, we reject events if the direction of the missing momentum traverses the gap between the barrel and the endcap since an undetected photon may be incorrectly attributed to missing particles. To suppress BB and qq background, we require that the number of photons on the tag side, n TAG \u03b3 , satisfy n TAG \u03b3 \u2264 2 (\u2264 1) for hadronic (leptonic) tags. For all modes except \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, we also require at most one photon on the signal side.",

Fake vector mesons can also originate from one of the electrons in a photon conversion and a hadron. As seen from generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 MC, such a background comes from \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03c0 0 (\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\u03bd \u03c4 decays.

In the momentum range between 0.5 GeV/c and 1.0 GeV/c such an electron can be misidentified as a kaon because the dE/dx distributions of kaons and electrons overlap. In other momentum ranges the electron can be misidentified as a pion. If we assign an electron mass to such a fake hadron, then the invariant mass M ee (e \u2212 h + ) will be small, as expected for conversions.

The center and rotation angle are determined by scanning to maximize the efficiency of the signal divided by the area. We blind the data in the signal region until all selection criteria are finalized so as not to bias our choice of selection criteria. Figures 4 and 5 show scatter-plots for data events and signal MC samples distributed over \u00b120\u03c3 in the M \u2113V 0 \u2212\u2206E plane for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5V 0 and eV 0 modes, respectively. For the \u03c4 \u2192 eV 0 modes, the dominant background comes from two-photon processes, while the fraction of qq and generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events is small due to the low electron fake rate. For the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c1 0 mode, the dominant background comes from e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq events. A smaller background of generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events in the region \u2206E < 0 GeV and M \u00b5V 0 < m \u03c4 is due to combinations of a fake muon and two pions. For the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c9 mode, there is a small background in the signal region from generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events in which a fake muon is combined with two pions from \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 and a fake \u03c0 0 (from ISR and beam background). A large background is from \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03c9\u03bd \u03c4 in the \u2206E < 0 GeV and M \u00b5V 0 < m \u03c4 region. For the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c6 mode, the dominant background is due to qq and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events in which a pion is misidentified as a kaon. For the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5K * 0 and \u00b5K * 0 modes, the dominant background comes from generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events with a fake muon, fake kaon and real pion from \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 . If one of the pions is misidentified as a kaon, then the reconstructed mass from generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 background could be greater than the \u03c4 lepton mass, since the kaon mass is greater than that of the pion. For the \u00b5\u03c1 0 and \u00b5\u03c9 modes, where significant background remains after applying the above-mentioned selection criteria, we extrapolate to the signal region by fitting to observed data in the \u00b15\u03c3 \u2206E M \u00b5V 0 data sideband using the sum of an exponential and a first-order polynomial function for generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and continuum, respectively. For the \u03c4 \u2192 eV 0 , \u00b5\u03c6, \u00b5K * 0 and \u00b5K * 0 modes, the background after all the event selection requirements have been applied is small; extrapolation to the signal region assumes that the background distribution is flat along the M \u2113V 0 axis within \u00b15\u03c3 \u2206E . We estimate the expected number of the background events in the signal region for each mode using the number of data events observed in the sideband region inside the horizontal lines but outside the signal region. The signal efficiency and background level for each mode are given in Table III. After estimating the background, we open the blinded regions. We observe one candidate event for each of the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c6, \u00b5K * 0 and \u00b5K * 0 modes, and no candidate events for other modes. In each case the number of events observed in the signal region is consistent with the expected number of background events.",

            "text": "We have searched for lepton-flavor-violating \u03c4 decays into a lepton and a vector meson using 854 fb \u22121 of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. Since no evidence for a signal is found, we set the following 90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fractions: B(\u03c4 \u2192 eV 0 ) < (1.8 \u2212 4.8) \u00d7 10 \u22128 and B(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5V 0 ) < (1.2 \u2212 8.4) \u00d7 10 \u22128 . These results improve upon our previously published upper limits by factors of up to 5.7. This improvement results both from using a larger data sample and from an improved rejection of specific backgrounds, such as di-baryon production in the continuum for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5V 0 modes, and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decays with a photon conversion for the \u03c4 \u2192 eV 0 modes. The more stringent upper limits reported here can be used to constrain the parameter space in various models of new physics.",
