A data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 is used. Final states containing two electrons or two muons and two or more jets are studied, as are states with one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum and two or more jets. No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. The observed and expected lower limits on the leptoquark mass at 95% confidence level extend up to 1.29 TeV and 1.23 TeV for first-and second-generation leptoquarks, respectively, as postulated in the minimal Buchm\u00fcller-R\u00fcckl-Wyler model, assuming a branching ratio into a charged lepton and a quark of 50%. In addition, measurements of particle-level fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for the Z \u2192 ee, Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and tt processes in several regions related to the search control regions. Predictions from a range of generators are compared with the measurements, and good agreement is seen for many of the observables. However, the predictions for the Z \u2192 measurements in observables sensitive to jet energies disagree with the data.",

The single-LQ production cross-section depends on \u03bb LQ\u2192 q whereas the pair-production cross-section is largely insensitive to this coupling. For pp interactions with a centreof-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV, gluon fusion represents the dominant pair-production mechanism for LQ masses below around 1 TeV. The contribution of the qq-annihilation process rises with LQ mass. Only scalar LQ production is considered in this paper because this is less model dependent than vector LQ production. The production of vector LQs depends on additional parameters and a full interpretation in such models is beyond the scope of this analysis. The results obtained here can, however, be regarded as conservative estimates of limits on vector LQ production, since the production cross-section for vector LQs is typically much larger than for scalar LQs, while the kinematic properties used to search for their signature are very similar for both spin hypotheses [8].",

For down-type leptoquarks with a charge of 1 3 e, assumed here as a benchmark, this can be written more explicitly as LQLQ \u2212\u2192 \u2212 q +q for the dilepton channel, and LQLQ \u2212\u2192 \u2212 q\u03bdq or LQLQ \u2212\u2192 \u03bdq +q for the lepton-neutrino channel, respectively. The four search channels in this paper correspond to the above decays. The eejj (\u03bc\u03bcjj) channel comprises exactly two electrons (muons) and at least two jets, and the e\u03bdjj (\u03bc\u03bdjj) channel requires exactly one electron (muon), missing momentum in the transverse plane and at least two jets. The electron and muon channels are treated separately as they correspond to LQs of different generations. The dilepton and lepton-neutrino channels are combined in order to increase the sensitivity to the parameter of the BRW model, \u03b2. While the main target of this paper are first-and second-generation LQs, there are also dedicated searches looking for 3rd generation LQ production [20,[30][31][32][33][34].",

For the particular benchmark model chosen, further signal and background discrimination could be achieved by exploiting flavour tagging in order to reject events with b-hadrons in the search region.

The measurements are made for the dominant process in each region (Z +jets or tt) exclusively. The motivation for making these measurements is as follows. Search CRs are typically in kinematic regions which are not directly covered by dedicated measurements of SM processes. For instance, the ATLAS measurement of Z + jets production described in Ref. [36] has much looser selections on the transverse momentum ( p T ) of leptons and jets than the region that includes Z bosons for this search. Event generators are tuned and validated to ensure that they agree with the available SM data. However, in some cases, although good agreement is seen for the regions covered by dedicated SM measurements, significant disagreements remain possible in more extreme regions where no measurements are available to validate the generator predictions. Indeed, although no disagreement was seen when validating generated Z +jets samples against various SM measurements [37], significant disagreement was observed in the Z +jets CR for this search. Extracting particle-level cross-sections in these CRs and related more extreme regions of phase space can therefore provide complementary information to validate the performance of event generators. Such measurements may lead to improved background modelling in future searches with final states using similar CRs (see for example Ref. [38]).",

The ID is immersed in a homogeneous 2 T magnetic field provided by a solenoid. Electron, photon, and jet energies are measured with sampling calorimeters. The calorimeter system covers a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid argon (LAr) electromag- 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The quantity R = ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 is used to define a cone size. netic calorimeters are deployed, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters. The forward region (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) is instrumented with a LAr calorimeter with copper (electromagnetic) and tungsten (hadronic) absorbers. Surrounding the calorimeters is a muon spectrometer (MS) with air-core toroid magnets to provide precise muon identification and momentum measurements, consisting of a system of precision tracking chambers providing coverage over |\u03b7| < 2.7, and detectors with triggering capabilities over |\u03b7| < 2.4.

The transverse energy of the electron candidates in the eej j (e\u03bd j j) channel must exceed 40 (65) GeV. Only electron candidates in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.47 and excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap EM calorimeters (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52) are used. The electron identification uses a multivariate technique to define different working points of selection efficiency. In the dielectron channel, the 'medium' identification working point with an efficiency above 90% for the candidates considered in this analysis is used. To achieve better rejection against jets misidentified as electrons, a tighter selection is used in the electron-neutrino channel. For the electron-neutrino channel, the 'tight' identification working point is used with an efficiency of 85% or more for candidates with p T above 65 GeV.

Figure 2 shows distributions of m j j and leading jet p T in the Z CR for the \u03bc\u03bcjj channel before and after reweighting. The data are better described by the Monte Carlo simulations following this reweighting. The total uncertainty (statistical, systematic and theory) is shown.

Experimental uncertainties from jet energy scale and jet energy resolution are typically around 1%. Similarly, the Sherpa 2.2.1 predictions of W +jets require reweighting to match the data. The functional form of the reweighting algorithm is similar to that used for the Z /\u03b3 * +jets sample. The signal regions differ from the control regions mainly by the cut on m or m T .

These probabilities are referred to as the prompt rate and fake rate, respectively. In the loose selection, several criteria that are used to suppress fake contributions in the nominal selection are relaxed. In particular, no isolation is required in the loose selection. The prompt rate is estimated to a good approximation from MC simulations, while the fake rate is estimated from a data sample enriched in fake backgrounds. To suppress contributions from prompt electrons in this sample, events are rejected if they contain at least two electron candidates that pass the 'medium' identification criteria. In both channels, events are also rejected if there are two electron candidates that fulfil the 'loose' object definition specific to the respective channel and have an invariant mass in an interval of \u00b120 GeV around the Z boson mass.

To ensure independence from the CRs, in the dilepton channel, only events with a dilepton invariant mass above 130 GeV are considered in the training. Similarly, only events with a transverse mass greater than 130 GeV are considered in the lepton-neutrino channel. Here, to further suppress the fake-electron contribution, it is required that E miss T > 150 GeV and that S > 3. These requirements define ",

The same object and event selections as in the TRs are made in the SRs, but in addition a requirement is placed on the BDT score. As stated above, each BDT is trained on half of the events in the TR and evaluated on the other half, and the obtained BDT score distribution is used to determine the SR. In this way, the SR determined based on a given BDT does not overlap with the TR used for that BDT. For the dilepton and lepton-neutrino channels separately, the SRs are defined as a single bin in the output score distribution of the respective BDT. The bin range is determined for each mass point separately by maximising the quantity [85] Z = (s + b) log(1 + s/b) \u2212 s, where s and b are the signal and background expectations, respectively. In this optimisation, a number of further requirements are placed on the background expectations: there have to be at least two background events in the chosen region; the statistical uncertainty of the number of background events estimated by the simulation has to be less than 20%; if less than ten background events are expected, the statistical uncertainty is required to be less than 10%.

Systematic uncertainties are incorporated in the p.d.f. as statistical nuisance parameters. They are introduced as shape uncertainties, i.e. they can only affect the relative size of a given background in different regions while preserving the overall number of expected events. This is done in order to remove strong correlations with the normalisation factors for the main backgrounds that are extracted from the CRs and which are used to scale MC yields to match data. Experimental uncertainties are treated as being fully correlated between different physics processes and fit regions. Theoretical or modelling uncertainties are treated as correlated in different fit regions, but uncorrelated between processes. The statistical uncertainties of the MC samples are included in the p.d.f. as nuisance parameters by constraint terms described by a distribution. The fit is performed in two stages: first, only the CRs are included in the fit in order to extract the normalisation factors for the three main backgrounds. These normalisation factors are then applied to the main backgrounds in the second step, which is a fit to only the SRs. The uncertainty in the normalisation factors from the CR fit is introduced in the form of Gaussian nuisance parameters. The best-fit central values and constraints on other nuisance parameters are not transferred from the CRs to the SRs. The optimal value and error of the signal strength and nuisance parameters as well as their correlations are determined simultaneously when the p.d.f. is fitted to data. This conservative two-step approach is chosen for its simplicity compared with the case of a simultaneous fit to all regions.",

This can be seen in Figs. 7 In all cases, the prediction of an alternative generator, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (with events generated at NLO accuracy for Z + 0, 1, 2 jets, showered using Pythia8 with the A14 tune, and for which different jet multiplicities were merged using the FxFx prescription [93]), is also shown. Typically, the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO prediction is also discrepant with the data for the same observables, but often in a direction opposite to that of the Sherpa 2.2.1 prediction. This suggests that the discrepancies are caused by choices of the generator parameters, which would have been tuned in a different phase-space region given by previous Z + jets measurements. The measurements provided by this paper will therefore help to validate new tunes of the generators to ensure better agreement in this region for future searches. These disagreements in modelling are covered by the reweighting uncertainty when evaluating limits for the search. For the e\u03bcjj MRs, the predictions from the nominal Powheg simulation are found to agree with the data for all observables aside from the dilepton p T , where a slight mis-modelling is observed in the high tail, as can be seen in the examples shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The predictions of an alternative generator (MadGraph5_aMC@NLO) are also shown, and these do agree with the data for this observable.

Since these have a high discriminating power, the sensitivity of the SRs exhibits a strong dependence on the LQ mass below values of m LQ around 600 GeV, where the intervals between simulated mass points are greater than the typical mass resolution for adjacent masses (the converse is true for masses above around 600 GeV). Therefore, in this regime a simple interpolation of acceptance between simulated mass points does not give a reliable estimate of the limit in the mass interval.

Exclusion limits that are obtained at these scan points are used as conservative limits for the intermediate masses between these points. While for masses above \u223c 600 GeV the mass-scan intervals are smaller than the mass resolution at the test points, the intervals used below \u223c 600 GeV are larger than the mass resolution. Therefore, above \u223c 600 GeV a simple interpolation is used to obtain the limits in the mass intervals. In the range below \u223c 600 GeV this is not appropriate and a different approach is used. Since the acceptance of a given SR is highest for the mass point which the SR is designed for and lower at the neighbouring mass points, the limit is estimated for a given mass interval, from m 1 to m 2 , in the following way; two limits are evaluated for m 1 and m 2 using the SR defined by m 1 (i.e. the respective BDT trained for the mass hypothesis m 1 ). Similarly, two estimations are calculated for the SR defined by m 2 . For each SR, the weaker of the two limits is retained,   Fig. 8 Examples of the measured particle-level differential crosssections in the extreme eejj, \u03bc\u03bcjj and e\u03bcjj measurement regions, exclusively for the dominant process in each channel (Z \u2192 ee, Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and tt, respectively).

The red band represents the statistical component of the total uncertainty on the measurement which is indicated by the error bar on each point. For the leading jet p T measurement, the uncertainty in the second bin is smaller because the bin-by-bin correction factor from the alternative tt samples agrees more closely with the nominal ones than in neighbouring bins. The variable min ( j 0 , l) refers to the minimal difference in \u03c6 between the leading jet and a prompt lepton leaving two limits to consider, one from each SR. Of these two remaining results from the two SRs, the stronger limit is used. The 95% CL upper limits on the cross-section for scalar-LQ pair production, normalised to the predicted crosssection, are presented as a function of m LQ in Fig. 10 for first-and second-generation LQs for an assumed value of \u03b2 = 0.5. Expected limits with their one and two standarddeviation bands are also shown. The observed limits are consistent with the expected limits for all mass points for both channels.

The measurements involving jet energies and angles are found to exhibit a degree of mis-modelling by both the nominal and alternative simulations. The nominal and alternative generator predictions are often discrepant with respect to the data in different directions, indicating that these differences are symptoms of different choices of the generator parameters, which would have been tuned in less extreme regions of phase-space given by previous Z + jets measurements.

These regions corresponds to the SRs albeit with the BDT selection removed. For each channel, one of the most dis-criminating variables is shown (m min LQ for the dilepton, m T LQ for the lepton-neutrino channel). In addition, the E miss T distribution is shown for the lepton-neutrino channel, as this is a characteristic variable for this channel newly included in this search. For symmetry, the subleading lepton p T is shown in the dilepton channel.      ",
