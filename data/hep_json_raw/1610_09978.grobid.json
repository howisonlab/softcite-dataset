Events are chosen by requiring an oppositecharge e\u03bc pair and two b-tagged jets in the final state. The normalised differential cross-sections of top-quark pair production are presented as functions of additional-jet multiplicity and transverse momentum, p T . The fraction of signal events that do not contain additional jet activity in a given rapidity region, the gap fraction, is measured as a function of the p T threshold for additional jets, and is also presented for different invariant mass regions of the e\u03bcbb system. All measurements are corrected for detector effects and presented as particle-level distributions compared to predictions with different theoretical approaches for QCD radiation. While the kinematics of the jets from top-quark decays are described well, the generators show differing levels of agreement with the measurements of observables that depend on the production of additional jets.",

The higher centre-of-mass energy of the pp scattering process in LHC Run 2 opens a large kinematic phase space for QCD radiation. Several theoretical approaches are available to model the production of these jets in tt processes, including next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculations, partonshower models, and methods matching fixed-order QCD with the parton shower. The aim of this analysis is to test the predictions of extra jet production in these approaches and to provide data to adjust free parameters of the models to optimise their predictions.",

Additional jets are defined as jets produced in addition to the two b-tagged jets required for the event selection, without requiring any matching of jets to partons. In order to probe the p T dependence of the hard-gluon emission, this analysis measures the normalised differential tt cross-sections as a function of the jet multiplicity for different transverse momentum ( p T ) thresholds of the additional jets. The p T of the leading additional jet is measured, as well as the p T of the leading and sub-leading jets initiated by b-quarks (\"b-jets\"), which are top-quark decay products in most of the events.",

These earlier measurements were performed in the lepton+jets channel where the inclusive jet multiplicity was measured, since it is difficult to distinguish jets originating in W decays from additional jets produced by QCD radiation.

Powheg is interfaced to the CT10 [19] NLO parton distribution function (PDF) set, while Pythia6 uses the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [20]. Pythia simulates the underlying event and parton shower using the P2012 set of tuned parameters (tune) [21]. The \"h damp \" parameter, which controls the p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, is set to the mass of the top quark (m t ). The main effect of this is to regulate the highp T emission against which the tt system recoils. The choice of this h damp value has been found to improve the modelling of the tt system kinematics with respect to data in previous analyses [6]. In order to investigate the effects of initial-and final-state radiation, alternative Powheg+Pythia6 samples are generated with the renormalisation and factorisation scales varied by a factor of 2 (0.5) and using low (high) radiation variations of the Perugia 2012 tune and an h damp value of m t (2m t ), corresponding to less (more) parton-shower radiation [6]. These samples are called RadHi and RadLo in the following. These variations are selected to cover the uncertainties in the measurements of differential distributions in 7 TeV data [22].

Electron candidates are identified by matching an innerdetector track to an isolated energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter, within the fiducial region of transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.47. Electron candidates are excluded if the energy cluster is within the transition region between the barrel and the endcap of the electromagnetic calorimeter, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, and if they are also reconstructed as photons. Electrons are selected using a multivariate algorithm and are required to satisfy a likelihood-based quality criterion, in order to provide high efficiency and good rejection of fake and nonprompt electrons [43,44]. Electron candidates must have tracks that pass the requirements of transverse impact parameter significance 2 |d sig 0 | < 5 and longitudinal impact parameter |z 0 sin \u03b8 | < 0.5 mm. Electrons must also pass isolation requirements based on inner-detector tracks and topological energy clusters varying as a function of \u03b7 and p T . The track isolation cone size is given by the smaller of R = 10 GeV/ p T and R = 0.2, i.e. a cone which increases in size at lower p T values, up to a maximum of 0.2. These requirements result in a 95% efficiency of the isolation cuts for electrons from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays with p T of 25 GeV and 99% for electrons with p T above 60 GeV; when estimated in simulated tt events, this efficiency is smaller by a few percent, due to the increased jet activity. Electrons that share a track with a muon are discarded. Double counting of electron energy deposits as jets is prevented by removing the closest jet with an angular distance R < 0.2 from a reconstructed electron. Following this, the electron is discarded if a jet exists within R < 0.4 of the electron, to ensure sufficient separation from nearby jet activity.",

Due to the presence of at least one jet that does not originate from the hard interaction, these events may appear in the wrong jet multiplicity bin.

Examples include events in which one or more particle-level jets do not pass the p T threshold for reconstruction-level jets and when the selection efficiency for inclusive tt events changes as a function of jet multiplicity. Furthermore, additional reconstructed jets without a corresponding particle-level jet may appear due to pile-up, or if a jet migrates into the fiducial volume due to an upward fluctuation caused by the p T resolution, or if a single particle-level jet is reconstructed as two separate jets. These effects lead to migrations between bins and are taken into account within an iterative Bayesian unfolding [59].",

The size of the bias, defined as the relative difference between the unfolded and predicted particle-level distributions, is found to be within the statistical uncertainty of the data. To check the size of a potential bias of the unfolding due to the relation between reconstructed and particle level distributions, the particle-level distributions are reweighted to alternative MC samples. Pseudo-experiments are performed based on the resulting alternative spectrum at reconstruction level. The pseudo-experiments are unfolded using the original correction procedure. The relative difference between the unfolded particle-level distribution and the predicted particle-level distribution from the alternative MC sample is found to be well within the modelling uncertainty. In addition, it is ensured that differences between the nominal and alternative particle-level distributions are at least as large as the difference between data and the predicted reconstruction-level distributions. The effect of the uncertainties listed in Sect. 6 on the unfolded multiplicity and jet spectra is evaluated as follows. The uncertainties due to detector-related effects, such as JES, JER and b-tagging and data statistics, are propagated through the unfolding by varying the reconstructed objects for each uncertainty component by \u00b11\u03c3 .

The small corrections reflect the high selection efficiency and high purity of the event samples. At each threshold Q 0 , the baseline simulation predicts that around 80% of the selected reconstructed events that do not have a jet with p T > Q 0 also have no particle-level jet with p T > Q 0 . Therefore, a simple bin-by-bin correction method is considered adequate, rather than a full unfolding as used in Sect. 8. Systematic uncertainties arise in this procedure from the uncertainties in C(Q 0 ) and the subtracted backgrounds. The uncertainties, as described in Sect. 6, are used to recalculate f data (Q 0 ) and C(Q 0 ) to obtain the gap fraction f part gap (Q 0 ). The corresponding quantities for Q sum are calculated accordingly. Figure 8 and Table 11   Fig. 10, and Fig. 11 shows the measured gap fractions f part gap (Q sum ) compared to various MC generators, corrected to the particle level. The predictions of Sherpa and MG5_aMC@NLO +Herwig++ agree well with each other and are within the uncertainties of the data, while Powheg+Pythia8 has slightly higher gap fractions, i.e., predicts too little radiation. Similarly to the jet multiplicity measurements, Powheg+Pythia6 (RadHi) agrees well with data, while the nominal and the Powheg+Pythia6 (RadLo) samples give similar but too high predictions compared to data. The results in Fig. 9d    contains only events with at least one additional jet and differs in this respect from the gap fraction distribution which includes events with no additional jet. However, the results are also consistent as Powheg+Pythia8 predicts a slightly softer p T spectrum for the additional jet which leads to the observed effect that less jets above the 25 GeV threshold are observed.",

The distribution of reconstructed m e\u03bcbb in the selected e\u03bc + 2 b-tagged jets events is reasonably well-reproduced by the nominal tt simulation sample, as shown in Fig. 13.

These boundaries are chosen to minimise migration between the regions. In the baseline simulation, around 85% of the reconstructed events in each m e\u03bcbb region belong to the corresponding region at particle level. The corresponding correction factors C m (Q 0 ) which translate the measured gap fraction in the reconstruction-level m e\u03bcbb region to the corresponding particle-level gap fractions f m (Q 0 ) are of similar    Tables 14 and 15 give the \u03c7 2 and p-values taking into account bin-by-bin correlations of the gap fractions compared to the predictions from the different generators. Figure 16 gives an alternative presentation of the gap fraction f m (Q 0 ) as a function of m e\u03bcbb for four different Q 0 values. The level of agreement between the data and the various predictions is consistent with the results of the gap fraction in rapidity bins.
