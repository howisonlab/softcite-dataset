            "text": "Since the large hadron collider (LHC) announced the discovery of a scalar-like resonance [1,2], many subsequent measurements confirmed that it is just the Higgs particle as the last brick of Standard Model (SM) [3]. Among these measurements, the generic Higgs coupling to vector gauge bosons presented the largest (\u223c 7%) deviation from SM prediction, but its experimental error is so big (\u00b156%) that the good agreements with SM still stand tenable. Both the non-explained phenomena like dark matter and the theoretical tension like hierarchy (naturalness) problem still keep the extensions to SM necessary. The interaction between Higgs scalar and vector gauge bosons is a key ingredient for the underlying nature of spontaneously breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry. In addition to the suggested experiments on kinematic distributions at LHC Run2 [4][5][6], future Higgs factories are under considerations, such as the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) in China, the International Linear Collider (ILC) in Japan, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and",

This modelindependent description however consists of 12 independent operators for a single HZZ vertex, it is not practical to extract so many Wilson coefficients in experiments or even on the above mentioned lepton colliders with luminosity up to several thousands of femtobarn. So further compression are described in [12,13] where only four phenomenological parameters are involved. Many works have been done on theoretical analysis [14][15][16], and on the running experiment of LHC to demonstrate how to constrain these 4 parameters with the distributions of polarization angle and azimuthal angle [17][18][19]. Cross section sensitivity studies of anomalous Higgs couplings have been performed at the LHC and electron-positron colliders in [20]. In ref. [21], the authors discussed also the angular distribution sensitivity of Z boson and Higgs decays at the electron-position collider at the energy of 350GeV and 500 GeV. Since both of the current circular electron position collider and the international linear collider are designed at the center of mass energy around 240GeV, it is necessary to do the sensitivity study of the Higgs production in detail at the specific design of detector.",

It's also worth to point out that, the distribution of polarization angle is normalized as in Eq.(12) by the cross section.

Different kinds of new physics structure will give more information in the angular distributions of the decay products of Z boson, which characterize the polarization fractions of the Z boson.
