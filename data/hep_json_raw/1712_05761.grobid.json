            "text": "Present experimental and astrophysical limits do not exclude that the neutron (n) oscillation into mirror neutron (n ), a sterile state exactly degenerate in mass with the neutron, can be a very fast process, in fact faster than the neutron decay itself, in which case it would have very interesting implications in cosmology and astrophysics. This process is sensitive to the magnetic field. Namely, if the mirror magnetic field B exists at the Earth, n\u2212n oscillation probability can be suppressed or resonantly amplified by the applied magnetic field B, depending on its strength and on the angle \u03b2 between B and B . We present the results of ultra-cold neutron storage measurements aiming to check the anomalies observed in previous experiments which could be a signal for n\u2212n oscillation in the presence of mirror magnetic field B \u223c 0.1 G. From the analysis of the experimental data new lower limits on n\u2212n oscillation time as a function of B were obtained, assuming that the mirror magnetic field is constant in time: \u03c4 nn > 17 s (95 % C.L.) for any B between 0.08 and 0.17 G, and \u03c4 nn / \u221a cos \u03b2 > 27 s (95 % C.L.) for any B in the interval (0.06 \u00f7 0.25) G.",

            "text": "The existence of mirror particles was proposed by Lee and Yang, in the same paper where the possibility of parity violation was put forward [1], for restoring parity in more extended sense: for our particles being left-handed, Parity can be interpreted as a discrete symmetry which exchanges them with their right-handed mirror partners. Hence the parity, violated in each of ordinary and mirror sectors separately, would remain as an exact symmetry between two sectors. Kobzarev, a e-mail: berezhiani@lngs.infn.it Okun and Pomeranchuk [2] observed that mirror particles cannot have ordinary strong, weak or electromagnetic interactions, and so they must form a hidden parallel world as an exact duplicate of ordinary one interacting with normal matter via gravity. This idea was further expanded, with different twists, in many subsequent papers . (See reviews [26][27][28]; for a historical overview, see also Ref. [29]).",

Thus, if mirror sector exists, then all our particles: the electron e, proton p, neutron n, photon \u03b3 , neutrinos \u03bd etc. must have invisible mass degenerate mirror twins: e , p , n , \u03b3 , \u03bd etc. which are sterile to our strong and electroweak interactions but interact with ordinary particles via universal gravity.",

The possible interactions between the particles of two sectors (encoded in L mix ), as the kinetic mixing between photon and mirror photon [9][10][11][12][13] or interactions mediated by heavy messengers coupled to both sectors, as gauge bosons/gauginos of common flavor symmetry [30] or common B \u2212 L symmetry [31,32], can induce mixing phenomena between ordinary and mirror particles. In fact, any neutral particle, elementary or composite, might have a mixing with its mirror twin. E.g. the photon kinetic mixing [9][10][11][12][13] can be searched experimentally via the positronium -mirror positronium oscillation [33][34][35][36][37] and also via direct detection of dark matter [38][39][40]. The gauge bosons of common flavor symmetry [30] can induce the mixing between the neutral pions and Kaons and their mirror partners, also with implications for dark matter direct search [41]. Three ordinary neutrinos \u03bd e,\u03bc \u03c4 can oscillate into their (sterile) mirror partners \u03bd e,\u03bc \u03c4 [14][15][16][17][18]. The respective mass-mixing terms can emerge via the effective interactions which violate B \u2212 L symmetries of both sectors. These interactions can be induced via the seesaw mechanism by heavy gauge singlet \"right-handed\" neutrinos [23][24][25] which interact with both ordinary and mirror leptons. On the other hand, the same B \u2212 L non-conserving interactions would induce CP violating processes between ordinary and mirror particles and thus generate the baryon asymmetries in both sectors [23][24][25]. In this way, the relation between the dark and observable matter fractions in the Universe, B / B 5, can be naturally explained [23][24][25][26][27][28].",

            "text": "As it was shown in Refs. [42,43], the present probes do not exclude the possibility that oscillation between the neutron n and its mirror twin n is a rather fast process, in fact faster than the neutron decay. The mass mixing, \u03b5(nn + n n), emerges from B-violating six-fermion effective operators of the type (udd)(u d d )/M 5 involving ordinary u, d and mirror u , d quarks, with M being a cutoff scale related to new physics beyond the Fermi scale. As far as the masses of n and n are exactly equal, they must have maximal mixing in vacuum and oscillate with timescale \u03c4 nn = \u03b5 \u22121 \u223c (M/10 TeV) 5 s. Existing experimental limits or cosmological/astrophysical bounds cannot exclude oscillation time \u03c4 nn = \u03c4 of few seconds [42]. 1 It is of key importance that in nuclei n \u2192 n transition is forbidden by energy conservation and thus nuclear stability bounds give no limitations on \u03c4 , while for free neutrons n\u2212n oscillation is affected by magnetic fields and coherent interactions with matter which makes this phenomenon rather elusive [42,43]. On the other hand, it is striking that n \u2192 n transitions faster than the neutron decay can have far going implications for the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays at cosmological distances [47][48][49], for the neutrons from solar flares [50], for primordial nucleosynthesis [51] and for neutron stars [25]. 2 1 For comparison, the neutron-antineutron oscillation time is restricted to be larger than few years by the direct experimental limit \u03c4 nn > 0.86\u00d7 10 8 s [44] as well as the indirect limits from the stability of nuclei, see Refs. [45,46] for a recent review. 2 In principle, n\u2212n transition can occur not only due to mass mixing term \u03b5nn + h.c. , but also due to transitional magnetic moment \u03b4\u03bc(F \u03bc\u03bd + F \u03bc\u03bd )n\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd n + h.c. between n and n states [53,54]. However, we do not discuss this possibility here and concentrate only on the mass-mixing effects.",

In this case the probability of n\u2212n oscillation after a time t depends on the applied magnetic field B as P B (t) = sin 2 (\u03c9t)/(\u03c9\u03c4 ) 2 , \u03c9 = 1 2 |\u03bcB| = (B/1 mG) \u00d7 4.5 s \u22121 , where \u03bc = \u22126 \u2022 10 \u221212 eV/G is the neutron magnetic moment. 3 For small fields (B < 1 mG or so, when \u03c9t < 1) one has P 0 = (t/\u03c4 ) 2 , while for large fields (B > 20 mG or so, when \u03c9t 1) oscillations are suppressed, P B < (1/\u03c4 \u03c9) 2 (t/\u03c4 ) 2 .

The Earth may capture some amount of mirror matter [25] if there exist strong enough interactions between ordinary and mirror particles, e.g. due to photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing. In fact, geophysical data on the Earth mass, moment of inertia, normal mode frequencies etc. still allow the presence of dark matter in the Earth with a mass fraction up to 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [64]. Due to a high temperature in the Earth core, the captured mirror matter might be ionized, at least partially. Then the drag of free mirror electrons by the Earth rotation, induced by their Rutherford-like scatterings off ordinary matter, again due to the photon kinetic mixing, could give rise to circular mirror currents inducing the mirror magnetic field. Such a mechanism of the electron drag was proposed in Ref. [65] and applied to the generation of the galactic magnetic fields. The dynamo effects could additionally enforce the mirror magnetic field at the Earth and also change its configuration, so that it could also exhibit significant variations in time [25,43]. For free neutrons propagating in the vacuum but in the presence of ordinary B and mirror B magnetic fields which are both non-zero and arbitrarily oriented, n\u2212n oscillation is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian:",

Therefore, a MC simulation was performed, first without considering the effects of n\u2212n oscillation, in order to obtain the mean value of free flight time t f = t , its variance t 2 , etc. In this way, the distribution of above values were computed by averaging them over the individual neutron trajectories in the trap, using well-known formulas [68] for the UCN losses per scattering. The fit parameters which were the slope of the initial (Maxwellian) spectrum of the neutrons and the UCN loss factor \u03b7, were adjusted for reproducing the experimental data as characteristic time constants for the neutron counts during the phases of monitoring, trap filling, UCN storage, and the trap emptying. The obtained values are in good agreement with the parameters used in the previous experiments with the same trap [58,60]. In this way, for the obtained fir parameters, for a given storage time t s we computed an average amount of wall scatterings n * that survived neutrons suffered starting from the moment they enter the trap in the stage of filling, to the moment when they hit the detectors in the emptying phase. 4 Namely, we get n * = 2068 \u00b1 18 for t s = 250 s in B1, B2, B3 modes and n * = 1487 \u00b1 15 for t s = 150 s in B4 mode with one detector.

(In contrast, the results of series B3 show no significant dispersion between different bins.) Second column of Table 1 for series B2 shows almost 4\u03c3 deviation from nullhypothesis if only statistical errors are taken into account, namely the values A B2 /n * and A nor B2 /n * are deviated from zero respectively by 3.9and4.0\u03c3 . On the other hand, even with enlarged error bars (third column of Table 1) both values A B and A nor B of series B2 still have respectively 2.3 and 2.5\u03c3 deviations from zero. The same result can be obtained by averaging between the bins of series B2 with enlarged error bars which shows that this discrepancy is pretty robust against the methods of the analysis.

However, duration and acquired statistics of our experiment is not enough to draw such a far going conclusion.

No significant deviation from zero was found in the value of E B (11). The corresponding 95 % C.L. lower limit on \u03c4 as a function of B is shown by solid brown curve in Fig. 7.

In overall, this corresponds to 3\u03c3 deviation of A B (9) from zero which can be interpreted via n\u2212n oscillation in the presence of mirror magnetic field Ref. [43].

The 95 % C.L. lower limit on \u03c4 as a function of B resulting from these measurements is shown by red solid curve in Fig. 7. However, in the same experiment Serebrov et al. [60], the part of measurements were performed also in in {B} mode with vertical magnetic field with central value B c = 0.2 G, which has shown substantial asymmetry between the counts N B and N \u2212B . The detailed analysis of these experimental data performed in Ref. [63] for the asymmetry A B indicate towards 5.2\u03c3 deviation from the null hypothesis, which can be interpreted as a signal of n\u2212n oscillation in the background of mirror magnetic field B 0.1\u00f70.2 G. Let us remark that in Ref. [63] the consequences of this anomaly for \u03c4 \u03b2 as a function of B was deduced assuming the homogeneity of the applied magnetic field and using the profile of functions S \u00b1 (B ) (13) calculated via the analytic formula (6), as shown on lower panel of Fig.  4. However, as we realized while performing our experiment in the same conditions, the magnetic field distribution was rather wide, and so the parameter area corresponding to the observed 5.2\u03c3 deviation as reproduced in Ref. [63] was not quite correct. Therefore, as far as the experiment Serebrov et al. [60] and our experiment were performed using the same UCN chamber, in the present paper we recalculated \u03c4 \u03b2 as a function of B using properly the functions S \u00b1 (B ) computed via our MC simulations (upper panel of Fig. 4). The red dashed contours in Fig. 7 confine the obtained 2\u03c3 area corresponding to this anomaly.",

For mirror fields smaller than 0.01 G, the lower limits on \u03c4 or \u03c4 \u03b2 are stronger, \u03c4 > 80 s at 95 % C.L. for B = 0.01 G and approaching \u03c4 > 386 s for B = 0, as obtained in Ref.

The results of other experiments restrict the parameter space relevant for this anomaly but cannot exclude it completely. In particular, lower limits on \u03c4 obtained from the same experiment [60] with horizontal and homogeneous magnetic field B = 0.2 G (solid red contour in Fig. 7) are compatible with the above anomaly for the range B = (0.08 \u00f7 0.35) G with respective values of \u03c4 ranging from 5 s to 55 s. Results of Ref. [61] (blue solid and dashed contours in Figs. 7) yield the lower limits \u03c4 > 12 s and \u03c4 \u03b2 > 15 s for any B less than 0.13 G. Combined with the above bounds of Ref.

Namely, for any B in the interval (0.08 \u00f7 0.17) G we get a lower limit on n\u2212n oscillation time \u03c4 > 17 s (95 % C.L.), and \u03c4 \u03b2 > 27 s for any B in the interval (0.06 \u00f7 0.25) G. Assuming that the mirror magnetic field B is constant in time, or in more precise terms, that its value and direction did not change significantly in time during the years passed from previous experiments to our measurements, we can combine our results with limits of previous works. Yet, we could not completely exclude the parameter areas of interest, and pink shaded regions in Fig. 7 correspond to regions which still can be relevant for above mentioned 5.2\u03c3 anomaly. (Interestingly, the left part of the pink shaded area, with B = (0.15 \u00f7 0.17) G and \u03c4 \u03b2 = (28 \u00f7 35) s, is also compatible with 2.5\u03c3 deviation observed in B2 series of our measurements.) For larger values of B the limit on \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u03b2 is considerably weakened and for B > 0.35 G the values of n\u2212n oscillation time as small as few seconds remains allowed.",

            "text": "The following remark is in order. The results of different experiments performed in different times can be combined only if one assumes that mirror magnetic field is constant in time. However, this is the most naive assumption, which means that rotations of the Earth and the Baby \"mirror Earth\" in its interior are completely synchronous, so that the orientation of the mirror magnetic field in the given experimental site does not change in time. On the other hand, if the axis of mirror dipole is deviated from its rotation axis, and there is some difference between angular velocities by which ordinary and magnetic fields precess, then the periodic variation of the signal can be expected. In addition, the captured mirror matter in the deep interior of the Earth can come into thermal equilibrium with the normal matter and thus can be present in the ionized form, due to a temperature of the Earth core of several thousand K. This can cause other periodic effects related to the Moon tides on the mirror gas inside the Earth. In addition, the dynamo mechanism in the differentially rotating mirror plasma could play a substantial role, mirror magnetic field can strongly increase and also its configuration can change from dipole to multipolar or toroidal configuration, with the subsequent inversion of the direction of the mirror dipole. In this the mirror magnetic field of the Earth may have also substantial large period time variation, perhaps of few years, like the sun's magnetic field. and it can be increased up to several Gauss. Unfortunately, time duration of our experiment (one reactor cycle) is not enough to place limits on possible long period time variation of mirror magnetic field. However, the possibility of time varying mirror field background should be taken in consideration while planning the next experiments searching for n\u2212n oscillation, as e.g. n \u2192 n \u2192 n regeneration experiment with cold neutrons at the stage of preparation at HFIR Reactor of the Oak Ridge national Laboratory [69,70] or any future experiments with the UCN storage chambers.",
