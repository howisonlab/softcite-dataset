In particular, we correct the mistake in radiative correction calculation made in our previous measurement based on a part of the data. The measured cross section is fitted with the vector meson dominance model with three \u03c1-like states and used to test the conserved vector current hypothesis in the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 decay.",
