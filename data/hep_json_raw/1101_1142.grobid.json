The transition form factor describes the effect of the strong interaction on the \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 P transition. It is a function, F (q 2 1 , q 2 2 ), of the photon virtualities q 2 i . We measure the differential cross sections for the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7 (\u2032) in the single tag mode where one of the outgoing electrons 1 (tagged) is detected while the other (untagged) is scattered at a small angle. The tagged electron emits a highly off-shell photon with the momentum transfer q 2 1 \u2261 \u2212Q 2 = (p \u2212 p \u2032 ) 2 , where p and p \u2032 are the four-momenta of the initial and final electrons. The momentum transfer to the untagged electron (q 2 2 ) is near zero. The form factor extracted from the single tag experiment is a function of one of the q 2 's: F (Q 2 ) \u2261 F (\u2212Q 2 , 0). To relate the differential cross section d\u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 P )/dQ 2 to the transition form factor we use formulae equivalent to those for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 cross section in Eqs.

Since a significant fraction of signal events contains beam-generated spurious track and photon candidates, one extra track and any number of extra photons are allowed in an event. The tracks corresponding to the charged pions and electron must have a point of closest approach to the nominal interaction point (IP) that is within 2.5 cm along the beam axis and less than 1.5 cm in the transverse plane. The track transverse momentum must be greater than 50 MeV/c 2 . The identified pion candidates must have polar angles in the range 25.8 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 137.5 \u2022 , while the track identified as an electron must be in the angular range 22.2 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 137.5 \u2022 (36.7-154.1 \u2022 in the e + e \u2212 c.m. frame). The angular requirements are needed for good electron and pion identification. Electrons and pions are selected using a likelihood based identification algorithm, which combines the measurements of the tracking system, the Cherenkov detector, and the electromagnetic calorimeter. The electron identification efficiency is about 98-99%, with a pion-misidentification probability below 10%. The pions are identified with about 98% efficiency and a electronmisidentification rate of about 7%. To recover electron energy loss due to bremsstrahlung, both internal and in the detector material before the drift chamber, the energy of any calorimeter shower close to the electron direction (within 35 and 50 mrad for the polar and azimuthal angle, respectively) is combined with the measured energy of the electron track. The resulting c.m. energy of the electron candidate must be greater than 1 GeV.",

The parameter R s is found to vary from 0.15 to 0.10 with increasing Q 2 . The systematic uncertainty on R s (13%) was estimated above. To calculate R b for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7\u03c0 0 process, the simulated background events are reweighted to reproduce the \u03b7\u03c0 0 mass spectrum observed in data (Fig. 9). The R b value varies from 2.0 to 1.5. The systematic uncertainty on R b is estimated based on its \u03b7\u03c0 0 mass dependence. The maximum deviation from the value averaged over the \u03b7\u03c0 0 spectrum of about 25% is found when we exclude events with mass near the \u03b7\u03c0 0 threshold. This deviation is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty on R b . The r distribution for background events from two-photon \u03b7 \u2032 production (R b is about 10) differs significantly from the distribution for \u03b7\u03c0 0 events. Therefore we first subtract the calculated \u03b7 \u2032 contribution from N 1 and N 2 in each Q 2 interval, and then calculate N s assuming that the remaining background comes from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7\u03c0 0 process.

Events of the process under study satisfying our selection criteria pass a filter selecting events with at least three tracks in the drift chamber originating from the interaction region. The filter inefficiency is measured from data using a small fraction of selected events that does not pass the background filters.

Since the time-and space-like form factors are expected to be similar at high Q 2 , in Fig. 16 we show the results of the high-Q 2 time-like measurements together with the space-like data. The form factors at Q 2 = 14.2 GeV 2 are obtained from the values of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u03b3 cross sections measured by CLEO [18] near the peak of the \u03c8(3770) resonance. We calculate the form factor using the formulas from Ref. [19] under the assumption that the contributions of the \u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u03b3 decays to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u03b3 cross sections are negligible. It is seen that the measured time-and space-like form factors at Q 2 \u2248 14 GeV 2 are in agreement both for \u03b7 and for \u03b7 \u2032 . The BABAR measurements of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u03b3 cross sections [19] allow us to extend the Q 2 region for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 form factor measurements up to 112 GeV 2 .",

The pion decay constant is determined from leptonic \u03c0 decays to be 130.4 \u00b1 0.2 MeV [16]. For the |n and |s states, we use the \"theoretical\" values from Ref. [26]: f n = f \u03c0 and f s = 2f 2 K \u2212 f 2 \u03c0 \u2248 1.36f \u03c0 (f K /f \u03c0 = 1.193 \u00b1 0.006 [16]), which agree to within 10% with the \"phenomenological\" values [26] extracted from the analysis of experimental data, for example, for the two-photon \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decays. The currently accepted value of the mixing angle \u03c6 is about 41 \u2022 [28]. Under the assumption that the |n and \u03c0 0 distribution amplitudes are similar to each other, the only difference between the |n and \u03c0 0 form factors is a factor of 3/5 that arises from the quark charges. In Fig. 17 the form factor for the |n -state multiplied by 3Q 2 /5 is compared with the measured \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 form factor [1] and the results of the QCD calculations performed by A. P. Bakulev, S. V. Mikhailov and N. G. Stefanis [29] for the asymptotic DA [30], the Chernyak-Zhitnitsky \u03c0 0 DA [31], and the \u03c0 0 DA derived from QCD sum rules with non-local condensates [32]. The horizontal dashed line indicates the asymptotic limit for the \u03c0 0 form factor. The Q 2 dependencies of the measured |n and \u03c0 0 form factors are significantly different. This indicates that the distribution amplitudes for the |n and \u03c0 0 are significantly different as well. The data for the |n form factor are well described by the model with DA from Ref. [32], while the data for the \u03c0 0 form factor is reproduced by the models with a significantly wider DA [21,22] or a flat DA [23][24][25].",
