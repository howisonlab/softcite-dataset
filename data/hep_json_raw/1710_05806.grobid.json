            "text": "The magnitude of A N increases for both \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 particles with x F for p \u2191 beam, but the sign of A N is negative for the \u03c0 \u2212 data. The values of A N are large for high values of x F , up to 0.29 \u00b1 0.09 for \u03c0 + and down to 0.37 \u00b1 0.07 for \u03c0 \u2212 . Detailed analysis of data at p = 200 GeV/c shown a threshold effect in which A N increases dramatically above p T = 0.7 GeV/c [1]. The E-704 experimental results obtained for A N (x F ) above and below p T threshold indicated that the increase of A N is primarily x F effect above a p T threshold. The situation is similar for study of the A N (x F ) withp \u2191 beam with taken into account the change of signs of electric charge for the beam and secondary particles under consideration. Furthermore the p T dependence was obtained for A N for charged pion production in inclusive reaction (2) withp \u2191 beam [5]. As example, figure 1 shows the dependence of A N on x F (left) and p T (right) for secondary charged pions in (2). In this case the E-704 data exhibit an almost mirror symmetric dependence in x F . The analyzing power for \u03c0 \u2212 production increases from 0.0 to about +0.25 with increasing x F above p T \u223c 0.5 GeV/c while, for \u03c0 + production, A N decreases from 0.0 to about -0.35 with increasing x F above the same p T . The E-704 results withp \u2191 show a threshold effect about p T \u223c 0.5 GeV/c, above which A N increases in magnitude for both \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 and for transverse momenta below this p T value, A N is significantly smaller and compatible with zero [5]. The threshold effect was also confirmed by the results of additional analysis for p T \u2265 0.5 GeV/c. Therefore the E-704 experimental results for (2) show the magnitude of A N increases for both types of charged pions with increasing x F , but the sign of A N is positive for the \u03c0 \u2212 data and negative for \u03c0 + data above the same p T \u223c 0.5 GeV/c. It appears that A N depends primarily on x F namely, and reaches large values above the p T threshold of about 0.5 GeV/c as well as for inclusive reaction (1) with charged pions at some higher threshold p T . Therefore A N seems similar (in the sense of behavior and magnitude) for p \u2191 /p \u2191 beams in the case of opposite charges for pions, i.e. the reaction (1) with proton beam and inclusive \u03c0 + the A N appears to be similar to that in reaction (2) with antiproton beam and inclusive \u03c0 \u2212 and vise versa. One can note that the models based on non-perturbative approaches, such as a soft pion exchange mechanism [6], resonance-decay interference between real and virtual channels [7] and rotating constituents in the polarized (anti)proton [8] appear to be in good qualitative agreement with the features of the data on the pion production asymmetry measured with the both polarized protons and antiprotons.",

            "text": "The kinematic dependencies of A N on x F , p T were also studied for the \u03c0 0 production in the inclusive reactions (1) and (2) in E-704 experiment [1,9,10,11]. For the \u03c0 0 data obtained with p \u2191 beam, A N (x F ) has the same sign as for \u03c0 + data and is about half as large [1,10]. The similar situation is observed for A N (x F ) in thep \u2191 + p inclusive reaction for comparison \u03c0 0 results with \u03c0 \u2212 analyzing power [5,10]. Thus the \u03c0 0 productions by polarized p \u2191 andp \u2191 are related by charge conjugation of the beam and the produced particle. The measured asymmetries have the same sign and similar x F dependence [10]. At large x F , there is an indication that the magnitude of A N for \u03c0 0 production by incident antiprotons is less than for incident protons. This would mean that the interactions involve constituents other than gluons and quark-antiquark pairs in the target proton. The A N is observed to be zero for single-spin inclusive \u03c0 0 production in p \u2191 + p andp \u2191 + p inclusive reactions in the 1 < p T < 3 GeV/c region within a statistical accuracy [11]. But it should be noted that in this case the amount of data for studying (2) interactions was an order of magnitude less than that for (1) interactions. In general in perturbative QCD singlespin transverse asymmetries are expected to be practically zero. Thus this expectation in the 1 < p T < 3 GeV/c region is confirmed by the data from the E-704 experiment, if perturbative QCD is applicable to these p T values at beam momentum p = 200 GeV/c. Moreover the experimental errors are large for A N at p T > 2.5 GeV/c [11]. Therefore new experimental data with high statistics seem important for verification of some predictions of the QCD.",

It is suggested to have two stages of the SPASCHARM project: first of all, studies with unpolarized proton beams using a polarized target and second phase of the project is the using of polarized beams. The polarized p \u2191 (p \u2191 ) beam is obtained by selecting p \u2191 (p \u2191 ) from the weak decay of \u039b (\u039b) produced in a primary target by extracted proton beam. This method is used for both the E-704 experiment and the SPASCHARM setup. The main features are shown in table 1 for U-70 and Tevatron beams. As seen from table 1 there are some advantages of the expectations for U-70 (for instance, intensities for primary and polarized proton beams) with respect to corresponding Tevatron beam parameters. It should be noted the U-70 allows the study of single-spin asymmetry in deeply non-pertubative region for some range of \u221a s. for p = 15 GeV/c and 3.0% (9.0%) for p = 45 GeV/c. b The first / second line corresponds to the p \u2191 /p \u2191 beam.",

The difference in intensities of p \u2191 andp \u2191 beams increases dramatically with a growth of beam momentum. As seen for polarized proton beam the contribution of \u03c0 + from neutral kaon decays is small, furthermore this contribution decreases rapidly with beam momentum. Therefore the U-70 allows the polarized proton beam with good quality (purity). Figure 2 (right) shows that the beam ofp \u2191 with p = 16 GeV/c seems optimal in terms of intensity and background conditions. The number of \u03c0 \u2212 is approximately 3 times higher than the intensity of the antiproton beam. The separation of antiprotons at this level of background is quite possible with the help of Cherenkov beam counters.",

            "text": "The SPASCHARM detector is an open geometry setup with good particle identification and relatively large acceptance. Schematic view of the SPASCHARM is shown in figure 3. The SPASCHARM setup consists of the following main subsystems [2,4]: -various targets (liquid hydrogen, nuclear from Be up to Pb; polarized / unpolarized), -spectrometer for registration of charged particles (magnet, GEM detector, multiwire proportional chambers -PC and drift ones -DC), -electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is shown in figure 4 and it is made by \"shashlik\" technology which is well established and used successfully, for instance, during preparation the PANDA experiment, -hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), -set of detectors for particle identification and multiplicity measurement (ring image Cherenkov detector -RICH, muon spectrometer -MuD and time-of-light system -TOF). Figure 2. Intensity for beam of p \u2191 (left) andp \u2191 (right) along with pion background of appropriate sign of electric charge for maximum \u03b4p shown in table 1. The quantity is calculated for 10 13 primary protons with energy 60 GeV, where \u03be y is the transverse polarization averaged over ensemble. Data are taken from [4]. Subsystems of the SPASCHARM detector are designed for high quality particle identification. According to the Conceptual design report (CDR) [4] the SPASCHARM will provide registration of charged particles from 0.5 up to 50 GeV/c in full azimuth 2\u03c0, registration of \u03b3 from 0.2 up to 50 GeV/c with the same angular range as for charged particles, identification of charged particles for momentum domain 1-20 GeV/c, registration of decay particles from hyperons with future reconstruction of parent particle, high coordinate resolution for beam particles, especially, for elastic scattering study [4]. Furthermore there are following special requests for charmonium Figure 4. Scheme of supermodul for ECAL (\"shashlik\" consists from layers of Pb-absorber and scintillator). Picture is taken from [4]. study: momentum resolution is \u223c 2% at 10 GeV/c and energy resolution for electromagnetic calorimeter is 3%/ \u221a E. Therefore there are some advantages of the SPASCHARM project regarding of earlier experiments, for instance, E-704. In particular, addition of new detectors (GEM, MDC, high quality EMC etc.) allows the increase of statistics significantly compared to the previous experiments. Due to 2\u03c0 acceptance on azimuthal angle of the SPASCHARM setup one can expect that the systematic errors in A N will be small. With the use of polarized proton beam at SPASCHARM a precision measurement of A N for inclusive production in the transverse polarized beam fragmentation region in a wide (x F , p T )-region will be worthwhile [2]. One can expect that the kinematic ranges 0.2 < x F < 1.0 and 0.5 < p T < 3.5 GeV/c will be covered. Also the estimations will be obtained for accuracy of the A N measurement in the reactions (1), (2) and for corresponding time of data collection for various accelerator parameters (beam intensity, run duration etc.).",
