Prompt J/ \u03c8 mesons decaying into two muons are reconstructed in the rapidity region in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame ( y cm ), corresponding to either \u22122.86 < y cm < \u22121.86 or 0.94 < y cm < 1.94. The average v 2 result from the two rapidity ranges is reported over the transverse momentum (p T ) range from 0.2 to 10 GeV. Positive v 2 values are observed for the prompt J/ \u03c8 meson, as extracted from long-range two-particle correlations with charged hadrons, for 2 < p T < 8 GeV. The prompt J/ \u03c8 results are compared with previous CMS measurements of elliptic flow for open charm mesons (D 0 ) and strange hadrons. From these measurements, constraints can be obtained on the collective dynamics of charm quarks produced in high-multiplicity events arising from small systems.",

            "text": "Strong collective behavior is found in the azimuthal correlations of particles emitted in relativistic nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at the BNL RHIC [1-4] and at the CERN LHC [5-10]. These correlations, which are long-range in pseudorapidity (\u03b7), suggest the formation of a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) that exhibits nearly ideal hydrodynamic behavior [11][12][13]. The azimuthal correlation structure of emitted particles is typically characterized by its Fourier components [14]. In particular, within a hydrodynamic picture, the second and third Fourier anisotropy components are known as elliptic (v 2 ) and triangular (v 3 ) flow, respectively, and reflect the QGP medium response to the initial collision geometry and its fluctuations [15][16][17]. In recent years, similar longrange collective azimuthal correlations have also been observed in events with high final-state particle multiplicity in proton-proton (pp) [18][19][20][21], proton-nucleus (pA) [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30], and lighter AA collisions [31][32][33], raising the question of whether a fluid-like QGP is created in these much smaller systems. While experimental measurements in these small systems are consistent with the hydrodynamic expansion of a tiny QGP droplet, alternative scenarios based on gluon saturation in the initial state also claim to capture the E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. main features of the correlation data (recent reviews are provided in Refs. [34,35]).",

Thus, they are largely decoupled from the bulk production of soft gluons and light-flavor quarks at a later stage in AA collisions, and thereby probe the properties and dynamics of the QGP through its entire evolution [36]. A strong elliptic flow (v 2 ) signal has been observed for open heavy-flavor D 0 mesons in both AuAu collisions at RHIC [37] and PbPb collisions at the LHC [38][39][40], suggesting that charm quarks may develop strong collective flow behavior.

            "text": "In the study of collectivity in small systems, such as that occurring in pp or pPb collisions, a key open question is whether the strong collective behavior observed for bulk constituents in high-multiplicity events also extends to charm and bottom quarks. Long-range correlations involving inclusive muons at high transverse momentum (p T ) reveal a hint of heavy-flavor quark collectivity in pPb collisions [42]. Furthermore, the recent observation of a significant elliptic flow signal for prompt D 0 mesons in pPb collisions has provided evidence for charm quark collectivity in a small system [43]. The v 2 signal for D 0 mesons is found to be smaller than that of light-flavor mesons at a given p T , indicating https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.02.018 0370-2693/\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

Funded by SCOAP 3 . that in these small systems there is a weaker collective motion for charm quarks, as compared to that of the bulk medium. However, as the D 0 meson carries both a light and a charm quark, the relative contribution of these different flavor quarks to the observed v 2 signal is not fully constrained. Without detailed theoretical modeling, a scenario is not excluded where the D 0 meson v 2 signal is entirely carried by the light-flavor quark. The observation of an elliptic flow signal for J/ \u03c8 mesons in a small system could provide more direct evidence of charm quark collectivity and could impose new constraints on the collective dynamics of heavy-quark production in such collisions. Furthermore, heavy-quark collectivity may also provide a hint of how, in small systems, hard probes interact with the QGP [36], assuming this is formed. First measurement of inclusive J/ \u03c8 (combined charmonia and J/ \u03c8 mesons from decay of open beauty hadrons) v 2 in pPb collisions was reported in Ref. [44], where positive v 2 coefficients were found in the range of 3 < p T < 6 GeV with center-of-mass rapidities \u22124.46 < y cm < \u22122.96 or 2.03 < y cm < 3.53. A recent model calculation of J/ \u03c8 v 2 in pPb collisions suggests little v 2 signal arising from final-state interactions between charm quarks and the QGP medium [45].",

Iron and quartz-fiber Cherenkov hadron forward (HF) calorimeters cover the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2.

Results obtained separately for J/ \u03c8 meson rapidity in the Pb-and p-going direction are compared, and found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties. Thus, as mentioned earlier, combined v 2 values are presented for the best statistical precision. The v 2 results for K 0 S and hadrons (light, strange-flavor), and prompt D 0 mesons (open heavy-flavor), reported in a previous CMS publication [43] for the midrapidity region \u22121.46 < y cm < 0.54, are also shown for comparison.  Positive prompt J/ \u03c8 meson v 2 values are observed over a wide p T range from about 2 to 8 GeV. The prompt J/ \u03c8 meson v 2 results show a trend of first increasing up to p T \u223c 4 GeV and then decreasing toward higher p T . This observed trend appears to be in common with the other hadron species shown. In the p T range below 5 GeV, the v 2 values for J/ \u03c8 and D 0 mesons are consistent with each other within the uncertainties, while an indication of smaller v 2 values for J/ \u03c8 mesons than that for D 0 mesons is seen for p T > 5 GeV, although the difference is not significant within current experimental uncertainties. Over the full p T range, the v 2 signal values for both J/ \u03c8 and D 0 hadrons are smaller than those for K 0 S and hadrons. This observation is consistent with the earlier conclusion that charm quarks develop a weaker collective dynamics than light quarks in small systems [43]. S , , and D 0 hadron results [43]. The effect of the correction for all particle species is most noticeable at very high p T , while the overall p T dependence of the v 2 data remains unchanged. The K 0 S mesons have a larger correction applied to their v 2 values (possibly because K 0 S mesons are more correlated with the bulk multiplicity, and thus are biased toward stronger jet correlations due to the selection of high multiplicities) and their v sub A recent model calculation of J/ \u03c8 v 2 in minimum bias pPb collisions, based on final-state interactions between produced charm quarks and a QGP medium, suggests a very small v 2 signal of less than 0.01 [45]. This calculation indicates that additional contributions, e.g., those from initial-state interactions, may be needed to account for the observed v 2 signal of prompt J/ \u03c8 mesons for highmultiplicity pPb events reported in this Letter.",

            "text": "Motivated by the possible formation of a hydrodynamically expanding QGP medium in small systems, the elliptic flow signals for K 0 S , , J/ \u03c8 and D 0 hadrons are compared as a function of transverse kinetic energy (K E T ) in Fig. 3 (lower), to account for the mass difference among the four hadron species [61,62]. Here, the values of v sub 2 and K E T are both divided by the number of constituent quarks, n q , to represent the collective flow signal at the partonic level in the context of the quark coalescence model [63][64][65], which postulates that the elliptic flow signal of a hadron is a sum of contributions from individual constituent quark flow values. As was previously reported in pPb collisions [27,43], a scaling of n q -normalized v sub 2 values is observed between the K 0 S meson and baryon, shown in Fig. 3 (lower). This scaling between light baryon and meson species systems produced in the collision (known as the number-of-constituent-quark or NCQ scaling) was first discovered in AA colliding systems [61,62,66], indicating that collectivity is first developed among the partons, which later recombine into final-state hadrons. The elliptic flow signal per quark (v sub 2 /n q ) for prompt J/ \u03c8 mesons at low K E T /n q range is consistent with those of K 0 S , , and prompt D 0 hadrons within large statistical uncertainties for the current data. There is a hint that the prompt J/ \u03c8 meson data tend to fall on the same trend as those of K 0 S and baryons, all of which are above the prompt D 0 meson data. However, the difference between the present prompt D 0 and J/ \u03c8 meson results deviates from 0 with a significance of only about 1.2 standard deviations at K E T /n q \u2248 0.4 GeV. A more definitive conclusion could be drawn with future high precision data. For K E T /n q > 1 GeV, the v sub 2 /n q for prompt D 0 and J/ \u03c8 mesons are consistently below that of the K 0 S meson. An indication of smaller v sub D 0 mesons contain a charm and a light-flavor quark, this observation would be consistent with a weaker collective behavior of heavy-flavor quarks than light quarks, possibly a consequence of the much smaller size of the collision system. Future data with improved precision will provide crucial insights to fully constrain the collective behavior of light-and heavy-flavor quarks in highmultiplicity, small systems.",

The procedure is to first fit the dimuon mass spectrum with a function composed of three components: two Crystal Ball functions [58] with different widths but common mean and tail parameters for the J/ \u03c8 signal (the tail parameters are fixed to the values obtained from simulation), S(m inv ), and an exponential function to model the background, B(m inv ).

In this Letter, the quoted uncertainties in v 2 are absolute values, and are found to have no dependence on p T , except those for the jet subtraction procedure. Systematic uncertainties originating from different sources are added in quadrature to obtain the overall systematic uncertainty shown as boxes in the figures. To evaluate the uncertainties arising from the efficiency correction to the J/ \u03c8 meson yield, the v 2 values are compared to the uncorrected ones, yielding an uncertainty of 0.008. The effect on the measured v 2 due to the residual contribution from nonprompt J/ \u03c8 mesons is evaluated by varying the 3D J/\u03c8 requirement such that the nonprompt J/ \u03c8 meson yield is doubled. The v 2 values are found not to change by more than \u00b10.004, which is assigned as the systematic uncertainty due to the J/ \u03c8 meson yield correction. Possible differences in the rejection efficiency of nonprompt J/ \u03c8 mesons between data and simulation are investigated and found to be negligible.
