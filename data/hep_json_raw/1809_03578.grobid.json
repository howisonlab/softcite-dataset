The masses of the P-wave B 0 s meson states are measured and the natural width of the B * s2 (5840) 0 state is determined. The first measurement of the mass difference between the charged and neutral B * mesons is also presented. The B * s2 (5840) 0 decay to B 0 K 0 S is observed, together with a measurement of its branching fraction relative to the B * s2 (5840) 0 \u2192 B + K \u2212 decay.",

            "text": "The P-wave B 0 s states are the bound states of b and s quarks with an orbital angular momentum L = 1. Since the b quark is considerably heavier than the strange quark, heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) [1,2] can be applied to describe this system. In the HQET framework, the state can be described by L and the spin of the light quark, providing a total angular momentum of the light subsystem j = L \u00b1 1 2 . In the case of L = 1, this results in j = 1 2 or j = 3 2 . Including the additional splitting from the spin of the heavy b quark results in a total angular momentum J = j \u00b1 1 2 , yielding two doublets, with the four states denoted as: B * s0 ( j = 1 2 , J P = 0 + ), B * s1 ( j = 1 2 , J P = 1 + ), B s1 ( j = 3 2 , J P = 1 + ), and B * s2 ( j = 3 2 , J P = 2 + ). The two former states have not been observed to date, while the latter two are known as the B s1 (5830) 0 and B * s2 (5840) 0 mesons, respectively. For simplicity in this paper, shortened symbols are used to denote e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch the following particles: K * 0 \u2261 K * (892) 0 , B 1 \u2261 B 1 (5721) 0 , B * 2 \u2261 B * 2 (5747) 0 , B s1 \u2261 B s1 (5830) 0 , B * s2 \u2261 B * s2 (5840) 0 , and B ( * ) s1,2 refers to either B s1 or B * s2 . Charge-conjugate states are implied throughout the paper. According to HQET, the decays B * s2 \u2192 B + K \u2212 , B * s2 \u2192 B * + K \u2212 , and B s1 \u2192 B * + K \u2212 are allowed and should proceed through a D-wave transition, while the decay B s1 \u2192 B + K \u2212 is forbidden. Similar conclusions apply to the decays into B ( * )0 K 0 S . Orbitally excited states of the B 0 s meson were observed by the CDF and D0 Collaborations via the decays into B ( * )+ K \u2212 [3,4]. More recently, the LHCb Collaboration presented a more precise study of these states and observed the decay B * s2 (5840) 0 \u2192 B * + K \u2212 [5], favouring the spin-parity assignment J P = 2 + for the B * s2 (5840) 0 state. The CDF Collaboration subsequently presented a study of excited B meson states [6] that included measurements of the B ( * ) s1,2 \u2192 B ( * )+ K \u2212 decays. Table 1 summarizes all the available experimental B ( * ) s1,2 results. In this paper, the first observation of the B * s2 \u2192 B 0 K 0 S decay and a measurement of its branching fraction relative to that of the B * s2 \u2192 B + K \u2212 decay are presented. The B + and B 0 candidates are reconstructed using the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )K * 0 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decays, respectively. Measurements of several ratios of branching fractions and ratios of production cross sections times branching fractions are determined using the formulae: Table 1 Results on the masses, mass differences, and natural widths of the B ( * ) s1,2 mesons from previous measurements. The mass differences are defined as \u0394M \u00b1",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are detected in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4 in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The main subdetectors used for the present analysis are the silicon tracker and the muon detection system. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. For nonisolated particles with transverse momentum 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90 (45-150) \u03bcm in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [8]. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for muons with p T < 10 GeV of 0.8-3.0% depending on |\u03b7| [9]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [7].",

The muon candidates must also satisfy the soft-muon identification criteria described in Ref. [9], and the kaon candidates must pass the high-purity track requirements detailed in Ref. [8]. A kinematic fit to the three tracks is performed that constrains the dimuon invariant mass to the world-average J/\u03c8 mass [12]. From all the reconstructed pp collision vertices in an event, the primary vertex (PV) is chosen as the one with the smallest B + pointing angle. This pointing angle is the angle between the B + candidate momentum and the vector from the PV to the reconstructed B + candidate vertex. Furthermore, in this procedure, if any of the three tracks used in the B + candidate reconstruction are included in the fit of the chosen PV, they are removed, and the PV is refitted.

Observation and evidence are reported for the decays B * s2 (5840) 0 \u2192 B 0 K 0 S and B s1 (5830) 0 \u2192 B * 0 K 0 S , respectively. Four ratios of branching fractions and two ratios of production cross sections multiplied by the branching fractions of the P-wave B 0 s mesons into a B meson and kaon are measured. In addition, the differences between the B ( * ) s1,2 mass and the sum of the B meson and kaon mass are determined, as well as the B * s2 (5840) 0 natural width. Finally, using a new approach, the mass differences M B 0 \u2212 M B + and M B * 0 \u2212 M B * + are measured, where the latter is determined for the first time.
