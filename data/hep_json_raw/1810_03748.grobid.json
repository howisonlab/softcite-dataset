Because the mass of a charm quark is heavier than \u039b QCD , so called heavy quark symmetry emerges in the hadron containing a charm quark and plays a central role in the classification and constraining the interactions. Belle and BaBar, which are B-factory experiments, have made significant advances in the field of open charm hadron spectroscopy in these 15 years. In this article, experimental advances on both open charm mesons and baryons by B-factory experiments are reviewed. Finally, the prospect of the open charm hadrons with the next generation B-factory experiment, Belle II is described.",

            "text": "Isolated quarks or gluons have never been observed. Only their bound state known as hadrons have been observed. Hadron dynamics is governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is nonperturvative in the energy scale of a hadron. Consequently, a couple of theoretical methods and models have been developed to describe them. These include the quark model, lattice QCD, QCD sum rule, and so forth. In particular, despite its relatively simple form, the quark model has reproduced the spectra of experimentally observed hadrons fairly well [1,2,3,4] with some exceptions like \u039b(1405) and Roper. Therefore, the quark model has been the basis of our understanding of hadrons. However, the connection between QCD and quark model remains unclear from first principles. To better understand the dynamics inside hadrons, open flavor heavy hadrons, which contain one charm or bottom quark as constituent, is a good probe.",

There have been revolutionary advances on heavy quark hadrons (not only open heavy hadrons, but also quarkonium states) spectroscopy since Belle and BaBar have begun collecting data. A huge number of hadrons that cannot be understood as ordinary mesons have been discovered, including charmonium-like states such as X(3872) [5], Y (4260) [6], and Z(4430) [7], which are generically called \"XY Z\" states, and bottomonium-like states Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) [8]. A review of exotic quarkonium-like hadrons driven by B-factory experiments can be found in [9]. Additionally, conventional charmonium and bottomonium states such as \u03b7 c (2S) or \u03b7 b (2S) have been discovered [10,11]. Finally, more than fifteen new open charm hadrons have been discovered and their properties comprehensively measured.

Two accelerators, KEKB [13,14] and PEP-II are asymmetric energy e + e \u2212 colliders operated mainly at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. This energy corresponds to the mass of an excited bottomonium state \u03a5(4S), which decays into a B meson pair with a branching fraction of almost 100%, and is the origin of the name B-factory. The Belle [15] and BaBar [16] detectors are designed as 4\u03c0 general purpose spectrometer in a solenoidal magnetic field. These detectors have some common features such as a good vertexing capability, charged particle identification, and photon energy measurement by the electromagnetic calorimeter to reconstruct various B-meson decays. The number of B meson pairs recorded are 772 \u00d7 10 6 for Belle and 466.5 \u00d7 10 6 for BaBar. The accumulated integrated luminosity is 980 fb \u22121 for Belle and 468 fb \u22121 for BaBar, this includes data with a center-ofmass energy other than \u03a5(4S). The sizes of data samples collected by B-factory experiments are more than two orders of magnitude higher than that accumulated by older experiments. The high statistics data and general purpose feature of B-factory experiments allow to study not only the CP violation in B decay but also rare B decays, \u03c4 and charm physics, and hadron spectroscopy. The data with B meson pairs are used to study open charm hadrons produced via B meson decay, while the data sample including other center-of-mass energies are used for those produced via the e + e \u2212 \u2192 cc reaction. Section 3 provides additional details about the production mechanism.",

One is decay of the B meson and the other is the e + e \u2212 \u2192 cc reaction followed by hadronization of the (anti) charm quark (also called continuum production). Each process has advantages and disadvantages in terms of charm hadron spectroscopy. They serve complementary roles. In the B decays, charmed hadrons are produced mainly via the Cabibbo favored b \u2192 c transition. In almost of all cases, not only charmed hadrons but also B mesons are reconstructed exclusively. This leads to a good signal purity compared with the e + e \u2212 \u2192 cc reaction. For a two body decay into charmed hadrons and known long-lived hadrons (such as pions or protons), the helicity of the charmed hadrons is constrained as the spin of B meson is zero. This leads to a model-independent determination of the spin of charmed hadrons. Additionally, as the final state is clearly defined after reconstructing the B meson, the parity can be also determined from the interference with the non-resonant decay processes. However, the production of the high spin state is suppressed and cannot be studied in B meson decays.",

The determination of the spin is not trivial because there are no constraint on the helicity of charmed hadron from the production, and it should be determined by the fit to the decay angular distribution. On the other hand, the production rate is relatively higher than that from B decay and higher spin states are not suppressed. Therefore, the number of signal events are higher than that from B meson decays.

Therefore, the width should be narrow and relatively easy to observe. In contrast, for the state with j q = 1/2 and L = 1, the same two-body decay should proceed in S-wave, and widths should be wide. Therefore, these states are difficult to be observed experimentally and were not observed prior to the B-factory era. Figure 1 shows the theoretically or experimentally expected/observed members of the D meson family. For the states firstly observed by B-factory experiments, the name of experiment is included in the figure. It is obvious that B-factory experiments have made significant contribution on the spectroscopy of the D meson family. Table 1 summarizes masses, widths, decay modes of D meson family.  [32]. The J P of D 1 (2420) + is not determined but assumed to be the same as isospin partner",

For the B \u2212 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 decay, the fit was performed in the plane of the two m 2 (D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 ). D * 0 (2400) 0 is observed. When D * 0 (2400) 0 is not included in the fit, or a state with J P other than 0 + is included, \u22122ln(L) increases by more than 200. Thus, Belle claimed the first observation of D * 0 (2400) 0 . The large width of 276 \u00b1 21 \u00b1 63 MeV suggests that this decay proceeds in the S-wave. Figure 2 (right) shows the minimal D * + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution with fitted result overlaid for states with common mixing angle \u03c9. In the fit, when the D 1 (2430) 0 is not included, or a state with J P other than 1 + are included, the \u22122ln(L) increases by more than 100. Thus Belle claimed the first observation of D 1 (2430) 0 . To date, this is the only significant evidence for this state. As the mass of the c quark is finite and heavy quark spin symmetry is not perfect, there should be some mixing between the S and D waves. Therefore, D 1 (2420) and D 1 (2430) are expressed as mixing of the S and D wave. The mixing angle is obtained as \u03c9 = \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1 0.02 rad, which means the S and D waves are dominant for D 1 (2420) and D 1 (2430), respectively. BaBar also did the Dalitz analysis for [22] with a data sample around six times higher than Belle's analysis [21], confirming the existence of D * 0 (2400) 0 with a mass and width of 2297 \u00b1 8 \u00b1 20 MeV/c 2 and 273 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 48 MeV, respectively. These values are consistent with Belle's result with better precision. Belle also studied the charged partners in theB",

As the spin of D * is one, the helicity angle distribution contains spin-parity information of the resonances. Here, the helicity angle \u03b8 H is defined as the angle between the primary \u03c0 and the slow \u03c0 in the D * rest frame. For natural parity states, the decay angle distribution should be sin 2 \u03b8 H whereas for unnatural parity states, the expected distribution is cos 2 \u03b8 H for 0 \u2212 and 1 + hcos 2 \u03b8 H for the other J P . Here, h is a helicity parameter. The data is divided in two samples:|cos\u03b8 H > 0.75|, which enriches the unnatural parity states and |cos\u03b8 H < 0.5|, which enriches the natural parity states. In the unnatural parity enriched samples, structures corresponding to D(2550) and D(2740) are visible.

The predicted mass for these quantum numbers are consistent with quark model prediction [20]. Many theoretical works studied these states not only from the masses but also from the decay width and the decay branching fractions [25,26,27,28]. Calculations with heavy quark effective theory [26] are reasonably consistent with these interpretations. The calculation based on the 3 P 0 model [25] shows that observed width of D(2550) is too broad compared to the predicted width of 22.1 MeV. Additionally, the LHCb measurement does not prefer 0 \u2212 over other unnatural parity J P for D(2550) (it is called D(2580) in LHCb's measurement [19]).

Therefore, the observation of two very narrow states decaying into D + s \u03c0 0 and D * s \u03c0 0 , which are called D * s0 (2317) + and D s1 (2460) + , was surprising. Figure 6 shows the D + s \u03c0 0 invariant mass distributions in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 cc reaction reported by BaBar [33]. This is the first observation of D * s0 (2317) + . Additionally, a peaking structure at 2.46 GeV/c 2 was observed in the D + s \u03c0 0 \u03b3 invariant mass distribution. Nowadays, the structure is interpreted as D s1 (2460) + . However, a detailed study including the determination of the significance was not conducted. Soon after that, the CLEO experiment confirmed the existence of D * s0 (2317) + along with the first observation of D s1 (2460) + decaying into D * + s \u03c0 0 [34]. The existence of D s1 (2460) + has been confirmed by Belle [35] and BaBar [36]. Belle also discovered the D s1 (2460) + decay modes of D + s \u03b3 and D + s \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [35]. As the D * s0 (2317) + decays into D + s \u03c0 0 , it is a natural-parity state. Considering J P = 2 + state D * s2 (2573) + is already observed, the most plausible J P is 0 + . On the other hand, D s1 (2460) + should be an unnatural-parity state because it decays into D * + s \u03c0 0 and the decay into the isospin allowable mode DK is not observed, although the mass is above the threshold. Angular analysis of D s1 (2460) + \u2192 D + s \u03b3 with D s1 (2460) + produced in the B decay by both Belle and BaBar suggest the spin is one [37,38]. Therefore, the J P is determined as 1 + . It is attractive to assign these two states as j q = 1/2 P-wave states. However, the masses of D * s0 (2317) + and D s1 (2460) + are smaller than those from the quark model prediction [20] by around 160 MeV/c 2 and 70 MeV/c 2 , respectively. Actually, the mass of D * s0 (2317) + is smaller than its possible non-strange partner D * 0 (2400) 0 although the constituent mass of the strange quark is around 100 MeV/c 2 heavier than up or down quarks. Additionally, the severe limits for the radiative decay \u0393(D * s0 (2317) + \u2192D * + s \u03b3) \u0393(D * s0 (2317) + \u2192D + s \u03c0 0 ) < 0.059 by CLEO [34] is inconsistent with the simple cs picture [40]. These facts have triggered many theoretical discussion for the nature of these two states. These include a DK or D * K molecule [41], tetra-quark [42], the mixing of cs and tetra-quark [43], etc. For more details of theoretical discussion, see for example Refs. [44,45] and references therein.",

The most severe limits on the width are 3.8 MeV for D * s0 (2317) + and 3.5 MeV for D s1 (2460) + , which were determined by BaBar [39]. There are many theoretical calculations for the decay width of these states. For example, in Ref.

The D s1 (2536) + , which was first observed by the ARGUS collaboration [51], is generally accepted as P-wave excited state with J = 1 and j q = 1/2. This is because the mass is very close to the quark model prediction [20] and the angular analysis by CLEO [52] as well as the non-observation of the DK decay mode shows it is an unnatural parity state. In the limit of heavy quark mass to be infinite, states with j q = 1/2 and j q = 3/2 must be completely separated. However, as the mass of charm quark is finite, D s1 (2536) + should be a mixed state of the j q = 1/2 and j q = 3/2 states. In the D s1 (2536) + \u2192 D * K decay, the j q = 1/2 state decays in the S-wave whereas the j q = 3/2 state decays in the D-wave. Therefore, measuring the relative widths of the D-and S-waves can provide information about the mixing angle. Belle performed full angular analysis for the D s1 (2536) + \u2192 D * K, D * \u2192K\u03c0 decay chain with D s1 (2536) + produced in the continuum reaction [53] and showed that \u0393 S /(\u0393 S +\u0393 D ) = 0.72\u00b10.05\u00b10.01. The S-wave contribution is larger than the D-wave one, which is contrary to the naive expectation. Before the start of the B-factory experiments, only the upper limit of the width was measured. BaBar performed the first significant measurement and obtained a value 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.04 MeV using the 8000 D s1 (2536) + sample in the continuum production [54].",

The Observation in the DK final states indicates that they are natural parity states. Soon after, Belle also studied the DK final state in the B + \u2192D 0 D 0 K + decay [56]. Belle found a signal with a mass and a width almost consistent with BaBar's result for the D * s1 (2700) with a statistical significance of 8.4\u03c3. D * sJ (2860) observed in the continuum production is not seen in the B meson decay. Figure 8 shows the D 0 K + invariant mass and the helicity angle distributions. From the helicity angle distribution, the spin of the D * s1 (2700) + is determined as one. As the DK decay is possible only for the natural parity state, the J P is determined as 1 \u2212 . BaBar analyzed the D * K final state in addition to the DK final state with improved statistics of 470 fb \u22121 [57]. Figure 9 shows the D * K invariant mass distribution. In the D * K mass distribution, in addition to the D * s1 (2700) + and D * sJ (2860) + observed in the DK mode, a new resonance D sJ (3040) + is found with a statistical significance of 6.0\u03c3. The non-observation of D sJ (3040) + in the DK decay mode indicates that it is an unnatural parity state. Additionally, the ratio of branching fractions for D * K to DK for D * s1 (2700) + and D * sJ (2860) + is reported and the obtained values were almost consistent with one. LHCb analyzed theD 0 K \u2212 final state in the B s \u2192D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay [58]. Interestingly, LHCb reported that D * sJ (2860) + originated from two overlapped states with J P equal to 1 \u2212 and 3 \u2212 , which we call D * s1 (2860) + and D * s3 (2860) + . Both D * s1 (2700) + and D * s1 (2860) + have J P equal to 1 \u2212 . In the quark model, J P = 1 \u2212 corresponds to the state with a radially excited state in a S-wave or a D-wave excited state with j q = 3/2. In the effective Lagrangian approach, according to the ratio of branching fractions for D * K to DK, D * s1 (2700) is preferred as the radially excited state [59]. It should be noted that as the D-wave and radially excited state should be mixed, D * s1 (2700) and D * s1 (2860) + should be not a pure radially or D-wave excited state, but instead are mixed states, The D * s3 (2860) + is a candidate of the state with a F-wave and j q = 5/2. For D sJ (3040) + , the experimental information is limited. Hence it is difficult to identify its nature. ",

In the limit of m Q \u2192 \u221e, the ratio becomes a large value of \u221a 3, which means the excited states for \u03c1 and \u03bb modes are separated. A detailed theoretical calculation based on the quark model shows the two excitation modes are well separated for the charmed baryon [60]. This suggests that charmed baryons can be interpreted rather simply as a bound state of a di-quark and a charm quark. It is important to verify if this di-quark and charm quark picture systematically explains the experimentally observed spectra. Additionally, the discussion of the heavy quark spin symmetry can be also applied to charmed baryons. The spectroscopy of charmed baryon provide a information to understand the role of heavy quark in the baryon.   Figure 10 shows the experimentally observed charmed baryons. Many of the excited states are discovered e + e \u2212 collider experiments such as CLEO, Belle, and BaBar. Historically, CLEO discovered the relatively light excited states while the next generation B-factory experiments discovered heavier excited states. Very recently, LHCb also join the spectroscopy of charmed baryons. ",

This value favors J P = 5/2 + over J P = 5/2 \u2212 from the calculations assuming heavy quark spin symmetry [63]. There is a subtlety in this calculation as the P -wave component in the \u03a3 c (2520)\u03c0 decay mode is neglected for 5/2 + assumption. A calculation based on the quark model incorporating heavy quark spin symmetry [64] shows that in a certain configuration, the P -wave contribution can be neglected and J P = 5/2 + gives R consistent with the measured value. BaBar discovered \u039b c (2940) + in the D 0 p final state [65]. Figure 12 shows the D 0 p invariant mass distribution. Clear peaks corresponding to \u039b c (2940) + is observed in addition to well known \u039b c (2880) + with a significance of 8.7\u03c3.

A study with higher statistics is needed to resolve whether these two peaks are originated from the same excited state. BaBar also determined the spin of the \u03a3 c (2455) 0 from the decay angular distribution in the B \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 c (2455) 0p decay. The spin 1/2 is preferred over 3/2 at the 4\u03c3 level, which is consistent with the quark model expectation for the lowest \u03a3 c state. In this decay mode, the helicity of \u03a3 c (2455) is fixed to be 1/2 as the angular spin of the B meson is zero and that for a proton is 1/2. This study clearly shows the usefulness of the B meson decay to determine the quantum number of the charmed baryons. It is important to measure the mass and width with a good precision to conclude if the two states observed at Belle and BaBar are the same.  The mass difference of the iso-multiplet is interesting as it contains information on the wave function of the charmed baryons. Naively, the mass of the neutral state is heavier than the doubly charged one because m(d) is heavier than m(u). However, due to the electro-magnetic repulsive force, the doubly charged state is predicted to be heavier than neutral one [83,84,85,86]. Belle precisely measured for the masses and widths of \u03a3 c (2455/2520) using full statistics [87] ",

In addition to the \u039e c (2970) and \u039e c (3080), BaBar discovered \u039e c (3055) + in the \u03a3 c (2455) ++ K \u2212 final state and found a evidence of \u039e c (3123) + in the \u03a3 c (2520) ++ K \u2212 final state. Finally, Belle studied the \u03a3 c (2455) ++ K \u2212 and \u03a3 c (2520) ++ K \u2212 final state with a data sample of 980 fb \u22121 [91]. The existence of \u039e c (3055) + is confirmed, but a peak structure corresponding to \u039e c (3123) + is not observed. The \u039e c (2970) +/0 is also observed in the \u039e c (2645) 0/+ \u03c0 +/\u2212 final state [92] and \u039e 0/+ c \u03c0 +/\u2212 final state [93]. Belle also observed \u039e c (3055) +/0 and \u039e c (3080) +/0 in the \u039bD +/0 final state [88]    [93]. The precisions for masses relative to that of ground state \u039e c are improved by roughly one order of magnitude compared to the previous world averages. The first significant measurements for the widths were achieved for \u039e c (2645) 0 , \u039e c (2790) +/0 , and \u039e c (2815) +/0 . The isospin splittings between the member of each isodoublet, which contain information about the wave function of baryons, as written in the description for the \u03a3 c family, are also measured. Table 6 summarizes the values. Interestingly, the splittings for \u039e c (2645) and \u039e \u2032 c are less then 1 MeV/c 2 whereas those for \u039e c (2790), \u039e c (2815) and \u039e c (2970) are larger than 3 MeV/c 2 with uncertainties of around 0.5 MeV/c 2 . Qualitatively, the values are small when the Coulomb repulsive potential is small. This situation is achieved when the charge radius is large. This naively explains the large splitting for \u039e c (2790) and \u039e c (2815), which are P-wave excited states. These tendencies are also qualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction [86,96] except for \u039e c (2970) which was not discovered when the theoretical calculations were performed. Table 6: Summary of the isospin splittings of the \u039e c baryons reported in [93].  [66] based on the mass of these states. This seems to be an attractive scenario. However, other theoretical calculations indicate that the D-wave assignment for \u039e c (3080) has several difficulties based on the measured branching fractions or the total width [97,98,69]. Additionally, the large decay branching fraction of \u039e c (3055) \u2192 \u039bD is not consistent with the chiral quark model calculation of the 3/2 + D-wave \u03bb mode excited state [97]. \u039e c (2970) is a candidate of the 2S excited state of \u039e c [63,67]. The large isosplitting for \u039e c (2970) measured by Belle should help to understand the nature of this baryon. \u039e c (2930) is a candidate for the P-wave excitation state of \u039e \u2032 c , which is possibly a \u039e \u2032 c analogue of \u03a3 c (2800), or a candidate of the 2S excited state of \u039e c [97,99,100].",

Belle confirmed the existence of these states except for \u2126 c (3119) 0 [104]. Naively, five excited \u2126 c states are expected (one 1/2 \u2212 , two 3/2 \u2212 , and 5/2 \u2212 ) in the P-wave state as the spin of the two strange quarks is one. Some of these newly discovered states should correspond to these P-wave states.  SuperKEKB/Belle II is a upgrade of the KEKB/Belle, which aims to collect a data set with 50 times integrated luminosity to search for the physics beyond the Standard Model. The KEKB accelerator has been upgraded to SuperKEKB, which is designed to have a peak luminosity 40 times higher than that of KEKB [105]. This is achieved by utilizing so called the \"nano-beam scheme\", where the beam size in the vertical axis is squeezed in around 50 nm at the interaction point [106], and doubling the beam current. The Belle detector has also been upgraded to the Belle II detector to cope with expected high beam originated background in SuperKEKB and to improve the performance [107]. At the time of this writing, Belle II experiment has just started the operation but only part of the vertex detector installed. Well-known hadrons such as D ( * ) or B have already been rediscovered. The operation with a full detector setup is scheduled for early 2019.",

            "text": "SuperKEKB/Belle II will allow us to study not only the physics beyond the Standard Model, but also hadron spectroscopy more deeply. For example, it is experimentally known that the hadron production cross section in the e + e \u2212 collision drops in the exponential curve as a function of hadron mass [108]. This means that the current B-factory data may miss a high mass resonance due to the small cross sections. Belle II will make it possible to discover these hadrons. The determination of the quantum number is very important to identify the nature of excited states. As shown in the example of the determination of the spin of \u03a3 c (2455) [80], the charmed hadrons produced from the B meson is very useful to determine their quantum numbers from the constraints on the helicities. Collecting more data should allow to observe higher spin state in the B decays and spin to be determined in a model independent way. Additionally, several theoretical papers have indicated that measuring various possible decays is important to understand the nature of hadrons. Many decay modes have yet to be surveyed such as those including \u03b7 mesons. It is important to study these decay modes comprehensively with a high statistics data sample.",

            "text": "In summary, there has been a significant progress in the field of open charm hadron spectroscopy, which has been driven by B-factory experiments, Belle and BaBar. More than fifteen new charmed mesons and baryons are discovered in this fifteen years and their properties are measured in a comprehensive manner. In the D meson family, two states which can be interpreted as L = 1 and j q = 1/2 are discovered. In the D S familiy, two interesting states D * s0 (2317) + and D s1 (2460) + are observed. Naively, they are too light to be interpreted as ordinal cs states with L = 1 and j q = 1/2. Many higher excited states are observed in the continuum productions for both D and D S states and J P are determined for some of them. In the baryon sector, new excited states are observed in \u039b c , \u03a3 c , \u039e c , and \u2126 c families. With the discovery of \u2126 c (2770), all the ground states predicted by quark model appeared all together. Newly discovered higher excited states are expected to be D-wave excited states, radial excited states, and possibly meson-baryon molecular states. To identify the nature, determination of J P is essential. However, J P of these states are almost not determined except for \u039b c (2880) + by Belle and \u039b c (2940) + by LHCb. There are still a lot of open questions in the open charm hadrons. Hope these will be answered by the Belle II experiment which has just observed its first collision.",

The masses of \u039e c (2970), \u039e c (3055), and \u039e c (3080) are commonly higher than those of \u039b/\u03a3 c (2765) + , \u039b c (2860) + , and \u039b c (2880) + by around 190 MeV/c 2 , suggesting that these states are strange analogue of \u039b + c family. A theoretical calculation based on the QCD sum rules indicates \u039b c (2860) + , \u039b c (2880) + and \u039e c (3055) + , \u039e c (3080) + are two heavy quark spin doublets with a D-wave in the \u03bb mode excitation",
