The search is based on proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV collected in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb \u22121 . No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Limits are set on supersymmetric particle masses for various supersymmetric models. Depending on the model, the search excludes gluino masses up to 1.32 TeV and squark masses up to 840 GeV. Limits are also set on the parameters of a minimal universal extra dimension model, excluding a compactification radius of 1/R c = 950 GeV for a cut-off scale times radius (\u039bR c ) of approximately 30.",

The squarks (q L andq R ) and sleptons (\u02dc L and\u02dc R ) are the scalar partners of the left-handed and right-handed quarks and leptons, the gluinos (g) are the fermionic partners of the gluons, and the charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 i with i = 1, 2) and neutralinos (\u03c7 0 i with i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are the mass eigenstates (ordered from the lightest to the heaviest) formed from the linear superpositions of the SUSY partners of the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons. An attractive feature of SUSY is that it can solve the SM hierarchy problem [10][11][12][13][14][15] if the gluino, higgsino and top squark masses are not much higher than the TeV scale.",

In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM such particles decay into jets, possibly leptons, and the lightest sparticle (LSP). If the LSP is stable owing to R-parity conservation [15][16][17][18][19] and only weakly interacting, it escapes detection, leading to missing transverse momentum (p miss T and its magnitude E miss T ) in the final state. In this scenario, the LSP can be a dark-matter candidate. Significant E miss T can also arise in R-parity-violating scenarios in which the LSP decays to final states containing neutrinos or in scenarios where neutrinos are present in the cascade decay chains of the produced sparticles.",

Different search channels are used in order to cover a broad parameter space: the events are selected by different requirements on the transverse momentum (p T ) of the leptons, either using low-p T leptons (referred to as the \"soft\" lepton selection), or high-p T leptons (referred to as the \"hard\" lepton selection). Each of these categories is further subdivided into a single-lepton and a dilepton search channel. The soft-lepton and hard-lepton channels are complementary, being more sensitive to supersymmetric spectra with small or large mass splittings, respectively, while the different lepton multiplicities cover different production and decay modes.

The calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 4.9, the forward region (3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) being instrumented with a liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeter for both the electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. In the central region, a high-granularity lead/LAr electromagnetic calorimeter covers |\u03b7| < 3.2, while the hadronic calorimeter uses two different detector technologies, with scintillator tiles (|\u03b7| < 1.7) or LAr (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) as active medium. The MS is based on three large superconducting toroids arranged with an eight-fold azimuthal coil symmetry around the calorimeters, and a system of three layers of precision tracking chambers providing coverage over |\u03b7| < 2.7, while dedicated fast chambers allow triggering over |\u03b7| < 2.4. The ATLAS trigger system [25] consists of three levels; the first level (L1) is a hardware-based system, while the second and third levels are software-based systems and are collectively referred to as the High Level Trigger (HLT).",

The simplified models studied here include the pair production of gluinos or first-and second-generation squarks with different hypotheses for their decay chains, as well as gluino-mediated top squark pair production. In these models, the LSP is always the lightest neutralino. The phenomenological models include scenarios for minimal super-gravity-mediated SUSY breaking (mSUGRA/CMSSM) [35][36][37][38][39][40], bilinear R-parity violation (bRPV) [41], natural gauge mediation (nGM) [42] and a non-universal Higgs-boson mass with gaugino mediation (NUHMG) [43]. 1 The nominal pp interaction point at the centre of the detector is defined as the origin of a right-handed coordinate system. The positive x-axis is defined by the direction from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, with the positive y-axis pointing upwards, while the beam direction defines the z-axis. The azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured around the beam axis and the polar angle \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).  Figure 1.

Two models are considered in this specific search for gluino-mediated top squark production. In the first model,t 1 is effectively decoupled and its mass is set to 2.5 TeV, a mass for which there is no current sensitivity to direct production. Each gluino decays with 100% branching fraction to a top quark and a virtual top squark, the latter exclusively decaying to a top quark and the\u03c7 0 1 , leading to a final state with a pair of top quarks and a neutralino,g \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 . The mass of the gluino is a free parameter and is varied up to 1.4 TeV, a value representative of the expected reach of the analysis. This final state is therefore characterised by the presence of four top quarks (decaying to four b-jets and four W bosons) and two\u03c7 0 1 . In the second model, the gluino is heavier than thet 1 , and the mass gap between thet 1 and the\u03c7 0 1 is smaller than the W boson mass and fixed to 20 GeV. Gluinos decay to a top quark and a top squark,g \u2192tt 1 , and thet 1 is set to exclusively decay to a charm quark and the\u03c7 0 1 ,t 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 . Using gluino-mediated production to probe this decay is particularly interesting as it is complementary to the direct pair production oft 1 , which is more difficult to extract from the background for this specific decay mode oft 1 (see ref. [44]). This final state is therefore characterised by the presence of two top quarks (decaying to two b-jets and two W bosons), two c-quarks and two\u03c7 0 1 .",

There are six parameters which can be varied to obtain different phenomenologies: tan \u03b2, m 1/2 , A 0 and the sign of \u00b5, defined above, as well as the squared mass terms of the two Higgs doublets: m 2 H 1 and m 2 H 2 . These parameters are set as follows: tan \u03b2 = 10, \u00b5 > 0, m 2 H 2 = 0; m 1/2 and m 2 H 1 are chosen such that the NLSP is a tau-sneutrino with properties satisfying Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints (see ref. [43]); A 0 is chosen to maximise the mass of the lightest Higgs boson (in NUHMG models, the Higgs boson mass obtained is usually lower than the measured value: varying A 0 allows the models considered here to minimise this difference to the level of a few GeV). In this model, there is a significant production of gluinos and squarks throughout the parameter space studied. The gluino decays mainly to a first-or second-generation quark/squark pair qq (\u2248 50%), but also to tt (\u2248 30%) or bb (\u2248 20%), while the squark cascade decay typically involves charginos, neutralinos and/or sleptons. This analysis also considers the mUED model, which is the minimal extension of the SM with one additional universal spatial dimension. The properties of the model depend on only three parameters: the compactification radius R c , the cut-off scale \u039b and the Higgs boson mass m h . In this model, the mass spectrum is naturally degenerate and the decay chain of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) quark to the lightest KK particle, the KK photon, gives a signature very similar to the supersymmetric decay chain of a squark to the lightest neutralino. Signal events for this model are generated with a Higgs-boson mass of 125 GeV.",

All the simplified models except the gluino-mediated top squark production are generated with up to one extra parton in the matrix element using Madgraph 5 1.3.33 [52] interfaced to Pythia 6.426 [53]; MLM matching [54] is applied with a scale parameter that is set to a quarter of the mass of the lightest sparticle in the hard-scattering matrix element. Herwig++ 2.5.2 [55] is used to generate the mUED, mSUGRA and nGM samples, as well as the samples for the simplified model with gluino-mediated top squark production. Finally, the NUHMG and bRPV samples are generated with Pythia 6.426. The ATLAS underlying-event tune AUET2 is used [56] for Madgraph 5 and Pythia 6 samples while the CTEQ6L1-UE-EE-3 tune [57] is used for Herwig++ samples. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) from CTEQ6L1 [58] are used for all signal samples.",

Further samples are also used to compute systematic uncertainties, as explained in section 8. The Drell-Yan samples used in the hard-lepton analyses have a filter which selects events at generation level by requiring the leptons to satisfy p T 1 ( 2 ) > 9(5) GeV and |\u03b7 1,2 | < 2.8. This filter prevents its use in the soft-lepton analyses which use Alpgen samples with a lepton p T cut at 5 GeV. The Alpgen [85] samples are generated with the MLM matching scheme and with 0 \u2264 N parton \u2264 5; for these samples Herwig 6.520 [86] is used for simulating the parton shower and fragmentation processes in combination with Jimmy [87] for underlying-event simulation. Pythia 6.426 is used for the Madgraph 5, AcerMC [75] and all powheg [69][70][71] samples except for the diboson powheg samples, which use Pythia 8.163 [88]. The powheg diboson samples have dilepton filters which increase the number of Monte Carlo events available for the dilepton analyses. Sherpa uses its own parton shower and fragmentation, and the Sherpa W +jets and Z/\u03b3 * +jets samples are generated with massive b/c-quarks to improve the treatment of the associated production of W/Z bosons with heavy flavour.",

The jet energy is then corrected at cluster level by weighting electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits with correction factors derived from Monte Carlo simulation. A correction is applied to subtract the expected contamination from pile-up: it is calculated as the product of the jet area in the (\u03b7, \u03c6) space and the average energy density of the event [99]. A further calibration, relating the response of the calorimeter to true jet energy [98,100], is then applied, with a residual correction to account for differences between the data in situ measurements and the Monte Carlo simulation.

The tightness of the selection criteria used in the b-tagging is optimised for each channel.

Since the control region is defined at low E miss T values, the triggers described in section 4 cannot be used. Instead, a combination of prescaled singlelepton triggers and unprescaled dilepton triggers is used. The prompt lepton contribution is subtracted from this multijet control region using MC simulation and fake is given by the fraction of preselected leptons passing the signal lepton selection in this region. The events are split into two samples depending on whether they have at least one b-tagged jet or none, in order to allow fake to vary as a function of the fake-lepton source.

As shown in table 10, the soft single-lepton channel uses three validation regions to probe the m T and E miss T extrapolations of each control region (3-jet, 5-jet or 3-jet inclusive W +jets and tt regions); there are therefore eighteen validation regions in the soft single-lepton channel. In the soft dimuon case, shown in the same table, three validation regions are defined to cross-check the lepton p T and m \u00b5\u00b5 extrapolations and the extrapolation from requiring one b-jet in the control region to none in the signal region. In the hard single-lepton channel, each signal region is associated with two validation regions in order to probe the E miss T and the m T extrapolations independently, as shown in table 11. Finally, as shown in table 12, in the hard dilepton channel, a total of twelve validation regions are defined to verify the extrapolation in the razor variable R between the various control and signal regions.The comparison of observed versus predicted event counts in the validation regions as obtained from the background-only fit are summarised in figure 11. More details on the normalisation factors found after the fit are given in section 10.1. Good agreement is seen between the predicted and observed yields in all regions. The systematic uncertainties are correlated across multiple control regions in each channel, see section 8, and are thus correlated for the validation regions in each channel. One of the main sources of systematic uncertainty in the validation regions is the theoretical uncertainty on the tt estimation related to the MC generator choice. The conservative uncertainty obtained from the comparison of Alpgen to powheg is correlated across channels and could explain the somewhat small absolute values obtained for the pulls shown in this figure. Furthermore, the 3-jet inclusive soft single-lepton validation regions are not independent of the other soft single-lepton validation regions; the maximum overlap of \u223c 40% occurs between the high-E miss T 3-jet inclusive and 3-jet validation regions.",
