Data from protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , were collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed data are well described by the Standard Model. Limits at the 95 % confidence level on new phenomena are presented based on the rate of events in an inclusive signal region and a restricted signal region targeting the rare decay Z \u2192 3\u03b3 , as well as di-photon and tri-photon resonance searches. For a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to four photons via a pair of intermediate pseudoscalar particles (a), limits are found to be \u03c3 \u00d7 BR(h \u2192 aa) \u00d7 BR(a \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 ) 2 < 10 \u22123 \u03c3 SM for 10 GeV < m a < 62 GeV. Limits are also presented for Higgs boson-like scalars (H ) for m H > 125 GeV, and for a Z decaying to three photons via Z \u2192 a + \u03b3 \u2192 3\u03b3 . Additionally, the observed limit on the branching ratio of the Z boson decay to three photons is found to be BR(Z \u2192 3\u03b3 ) < 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , a result five times stronger than the previous result from LEP.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) include phenomena that can result in final states consisting of three or more photons. Extensions of the SM scalar sector [1][2][3][4][5], for example, often include pseudoscalar particles (a) with couplings to the Higgs boson [6,7] (h) and branching ratios into photons that would be visible at the LHC, in addition to scalars (H ) with masses different from the SM-like Higgs boson of m h = 125 GeV that can also decay via H \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u03b3 . Other models feature additional vector gauge bosons that can decay to a photon and a new pseudoscalar boson, a, with the subsequent decay of the a into a pair of photons, resulting in a three-photon final state [8]. Moreover, in the SM, the Z boson can decay to three phoe-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch tons via a loop of W \u00b1 bosons or fermions. The decay is heavily suppressed and the branching ratio is predicted to be \u223c5\u00d710 \u221210 [9]. The current most stringent bound on this process comes from the L3 Collaboration, which placed a limit of BR(Z \u2192 3\u03b3 ) < 10 \u22125 [10]. The ATLAS detector has collected \u223c10 9 Z boson events, and thus an observation of this decay would indicate an enhancement of this decay rate and could be evidence of phenomena not predicted by the SM. Feynman diagrams for some of these beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) and rare SM scenarios are shown in Fig. 1.",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon micro-strip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (iron/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. Its bending power ranges from 2.0 to 7.5 T m. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A three-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels that together reduce the accepted event rate to 400 Hz on average depending on the data-taking conditions during 2012.",

Each candidate is additionally required to satisfy a set of loose photon identification criteria [12]. Stringent detector and data quality criteria are applied offline. Events are required to contain at least one interaction vertex, with no additional vertex requirements. Photon candidates must satisfy a pseudorapidity requirement of |\u03b7| < 2.37, excluding the transition region between the barrel and end-cap of 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, and must satisfy requirements on the shape of the energy deposit in the calorimeter. A photon candidate is rejected if the barycentre of its energy deposit is within a cone of R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 0.15 around the barycentre of the energy deposit of a higher p T photon candidate. Finally, selected photon candidates are required to satisfy a more stringent set of identification criteria, known as tight [12]. Photon isolation is defined by the amount of transverse energy, E iso T , deposited in the EM calorimeter within a cone of size R around the photon candidate, excluding the energy of the photon candidate itself. It is a powerful means of distinguishing between photons and hadronic jets misidentified as photons, since the energy clusters deposited by photons in the EM calorimeter tend to be narrower in the transverse direction than those deposited by jets. Because minimumbias proton-proton interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can affect the calculated photon isolation energy, a correction is applied based on an event-by-event energy density pileup estimation. This search uses an isolation cone of size R < 0.4, and a correction to the E iso T value of a photon candidate is made when another photon candidate passing the tight identification criteria is found within an annulus of 0.15 < R < 0.4 around the photon candidate. The correction consists of subtracting the p T value of the other photon candidate found within the annulus from the E iso T value of the photon candidate under consideration. The final isolation criterion is E iso T < 4 GeV.",

            "text": "A crucial aspect of the analysis is the data-driven estimate of the backgrounds where hadronic jets are misidentified as photons (hereafter called \"jet fakes\"), i.e., SM processes that can produce 2\u03b3 + 1-jet, 1\u03b3 + 2-jet, and 3-jet events. Collision data are used to derive efficiencies for photons passing the isolation criterion ( \u03b3 ) and rates at which jets are misidentified as isolated photons ( f jet ). These values of \u03b3 and f jet are then used in a likelihood matrix method (described below) to estimate the jet backgrounds. A sample of photon candidates consisting mainly of jet fakes is defined in the following way. The standard tight and loose photon identification categories are augmented with a medium definition [33], intermediate between tight and loose. The medium photon is defined by relaxing some EM shower shape requirements that provide high levels of rejection of jet fakes. When the medium definition is combined with a further requirement that the photon candidates fail tight (the combination hereafter called non-tight), the result is a sample of photon candidates that is primarily composed of jet fakes. This method presupposes that the E iso T distribution of the nontight sample is composed primarily of jet fakes, and that the subset of tight photons with higher values of E iso T (the \"tail\", here for E iso T > 7 GeV) is dominated by jet fakes. Under these assumptions, the tail of the non-tight distribution is scaled to match that of the tight distribution, thus providing a determination of the contribution of jet fakes to the signal region, i.e., the collection of photons that pass both the tight and the isolation criteria. The scaled non-tight distribution is then subtracted from the tight distribution. Photon isolation efficiency, \u03b3 , is then calculated as the ratio of the number of isolated photons (those that satisfy E iso T < 4 GeV) to the total number of photons in the tight distribution after this subtraction has been performed. The rate at which jet fakes are identified as photons, f jet , is the ratio of the number of isolated photons to the total number of photons in the nontight distribution.",

These are defined first by the three regions in the p T -\u03b7 plane to which each photon candidate belongs. These are the same three regions that are used to categorise photons and to calculate \u03b3 and f jet , described and labeled previously as regions 1-3. The remaining three criteria by which each event is categorized are three boolean variables, one for each photon candidate, indicating whether it passed or failed the isolation criterion. Since each of the three photon candidates either passes (P) or fails (F) isolation, there are 2 3 = 8 possible isolation combinations for three photons: PPP, PPF, PFP, FPP, PFF, FPF, FFP, and FFF.

Each term in a given sum is multiplied by the appropriate values of \u03b3 and f jet . A likelihood is then constructed consisting of a product of the 160 Poisson functions.

This calculation relies upon the assumptions that both the tail (E iso T > 7 GeV) of the E iso T distribution of tight photons and the entirety of the E iso T distribution of non-tight photons are primarily composed of jet fakes. Tests on simulations of photons and jets indicate that the true photon contamination in these jetdominated regions is between 5 and 15 %, depending on the region. These values are used to calculate different values of \u03b3 and f jet (where the number of photon candidates in a given region is altered by the corresponding percentage) which are then used in the jet background estimate. The deviations from the nominal signal region yield (assuming no true photon contamination) are calculated separately for the three final states of 2\u03b3 + 1 jet, 1\u03b3 + 2 jets, and 3 jets, and these values (4, 10 and 21 %, respectively) are taken as systematic uncertainties on the estimates of these backgrounds in the signal region.",

This procedure improves sensitivity to lower-mass two-photon resonances where the photon pairs are close together in R. To account for possible over-or under-correction due to a photon being near the edge of the isolation annulus, an additional systematic uncertainty is assessed. The p T values of all isolated photons in simulated samples are calibrated to yield agreement with the values observed in data [35]. Since the calibration factors for isolated photons deviate from one by typically less than 5 %, a value of 5 % is a conservative estimate of the uncertainty on photon p T . To assess the systematic uncertainty on the isolation energy correction, the measured value of the p T of the other tight photon in the isolation cone is varied by 5 %, the correction procedure is applied, and the effects are propagated to the final event selection in the signal region. For example, using simulated samples of a Higgs boson decaying to four photons via H \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u03b3 , the systematic uncertainty due to this effect is smaller for higher ratios of m a /m H (as large as 6 % when the p T is varied by \u22125 and <1 % when the p T is varied by +5 %, for m H = 900 GeV and m a = 440 GeV), and the uncertainty is larger for smaller ratios of m a /m H (as large as 69 % when the p T is varied by \u22125 and 12 % when the p T is varied by +5 %, for m H = 900 GeV and m a = 50 GeV), as the photons tend to overlap within the isolation cone more frequently.",

The observation is in agreement with the SM expectation. Additionally, while the event selection is optimised for a search for physics beyond the SM as opposed to a measurement of the 3\u03b3 inclusive cross section, the results are nevertheless compatible with the irreducible all-photon process expectations from the SM. The expected and observed yields in the signal region are presented in Table 3, and the expected and observed yields in signal and control regions where all three photons have passed the tight identification criterion are shown in Fig. 2. In the figure, the red hatched band, in the signal region bin, is the combination of statistical and systematic uncertainties on all background sources, while the black hatched band, in the control regions, is the combination of statistical uncertainties of the data-driven jet background estimate and the expected yields from simulated samples of SM background processes. For the inclusive signal region, this corresponds to a model-independent observed (expected \u00b11\u03c3 ) upper limit, at the 95 % confidence level (CL), on the number of signal events of 240 (273 +83 \u221266 ), and to the model-dependent upper limits on the inclusive fiducial cross section in the aforementioned acceptance for the signal scenarios of the BSM Higgs boson and Higgs boson-like decays and the Z decays shown in Table 4, where hypothesis testing and limit setting are calculated using the profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic for the C L s technique [40] in the asymptotic approximation [41,42]. The fiducial efficiencies for each signal scenario are determined with respect to a generator-level kinematic region with the same requirements applied to three-photon events as those used for the analysis signal region. This fiducial region is defined as the set of events that contain three photons where (1) each photon satisfies a pseudorapidity requirement of |\u03b7| < 2.37, excluding the transition region between the barrel and end-cap of 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, (2) the three photons satisfy p T > 22, 22, and 17 GeV, and (3) each photon satisfies E truth iso T < 4 GeV, where E truth iso T is a generator-level definition of the photon isolation criterion equivalent to that used for event selection on reconstructed events. The fiducial efficiencies are similar for the considered signal scenarios for mass points where the distributions of photon p T , for all photons, tend to peak higher than p T > 50 GeV. This is because the overall photon identification efficiency decreases for photons with p T < 50 GeV [12]. Since the p T distribution for at least one of the photons for signal scenarios with lower-mass resonances tends to peak at lower values, the fiducial efficiencies are lower.",

The bins along the horizontal axis correspond to orthogonal subsets of events where each subset is categorised by whether the three photons -ordered from largest to smallest values of p T -passed (\"P\") or failed (\"F\") the isolation criterion. The leftmost bin is the signal region, composed of events satisfying PPP, and the other bins are the different control regions, where at least one of the photon candidates failed the isolation criterion. The red hatched band, in the signal region bin, is the combination of statistical and systematic uncertainties, while the black hatched bands represent statistical uncertainties. As a result of the data-driven jet background estimate, the statistical uncertainty in each bin is partially correlated with the uncertainty on the data in that bin photons.

            "text": "In addition to the tests based on the number of events in the inclusive signal regions, searches are performed for resonances in the two-photon and three-photon invariant mass (m 2\u03b3 and m 3\u03b3 ) distributions for events in the inclusive signal region. For these resonance searches, the background contribution is estimated from a fit to the m 2\u03b3 or m 3\u03b3 sideband regions, and thus does not rely upon simulated samples for the background estimate. The sideband is modelled as a fourth-order polynomial, and the size of the sideband is mass-dependent, symmetric around the hypothesised resonance mass, following a local-spectrum approach. The range of the observed mass spectrum that is used for the sideband fit is a local, truncated subset of the full spectrum. For the m 2\u03b3 (m 3\u03b3 ) resonance search, the sideband is 20 (25) GeV in each direction for m 2\u03b3 (m 3\u03b3 ) < 90 (230) GeV, where the event counts change rapidly as a function of m 2\u03b3 (m 3\u03b3 ), and rises to a sideband size of 80 (100) GeV in each direction for m 2\u03b3 (m 3\u03b3 ) > 195 (425) GeV, increasing roughly linearly with mass as the spectrum becomes smoother. The m 2\u03b3 (m 3\u03b3 ) resonance search begins at a mass hypothesis of 10 (100) GeV, and proceeds in steps of 0.5 GeV. The signal component of the resonance search is a Gaussian function with a fixed width that varies with particle mass, and the widths are determined from simulated signal samples. Since the simulated signal samples are generated with a narrowwidth approximation for both the pseudoscalar a and the Z in all cases, the 2\u03b3 and 3\u03b3 mass resolutions for this search are equivalent to Gaussian functions that account for detector resolution, and are determined via fits to the simulated signal samples. Hypothesis testing and limit setting are performed using the profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic for the C L s technique in the asymptotic approximation. The resonance search is performed separately for the three two-photon mass spectra defined by the three possible photon pairings for three photons in the inclusive signal region. As mentioned previously, the photons are ordered by p T , from highest to lowest, and so the three two-photon mass spectra are denoted m 12 , m 13 and m 23 , where the 1, 2, and 3 refer to the p T -ordered photons. The observed m 2\u03b3 and m 3\u03b3 spectra in the inclusive signal region are shown in Fig. 3. Also shown in Fig. 3, for visualisation purposes only, is the background expectation per bin, determined from the sideband fit to data as a part of the resonance search. The resonance search is performed with a step size of 0.5 GeV and so the final results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate sensitivity to resonances with widths appropriate to the BSM models considered here. The widths of the bins in Fig. 3 do not correspond to the mass resolution for the signal scenarios in question. The background estimates and significances shown in Fig. 3 provide a complementary comparison of the local agreement between data and expectation. The lower panels show the significance, in units of standard deviations of a Gaussian function, of the observation in each bin, taking into account the fractional uncertainty on the background as a result of the sideband fit. The significances shown in the lower panels in Fig. 3 are derived from the p value for the background-only hypothesis for each bin, calculated using a frequentist binomial parameter test [43][44][45]. For regions beyond the sensitivity of the search, no background estimate is shown.",

Additionally, using the expected signal yields from simulated samples, inclusive limits are calculated for 300 GeV < m H < 900 GeV and for a range of m a < m H /2, including values beyond the range of the mass spectra used for the resonance search. These inclusive limits are shown in Table 5. as a result of the sideband fit. This significance is derived from the p value for the background-only hypothesis for each bin, calculated using a frequentist binomial parameter test [43][44][45]. The signal distributions used for the m 2\u03b3 resonance searches have two components, a narrow Gaussian core for correctly paired two-photon combinations and a wide distribution for incorrectly paired combinations that is well described by the polynomial used to simultaneously model the background shape for the resonance search described in Sect. 7.2",

For the range of m Z for which the resonance search is possible, the Z width exhibits a small dependence on m a . For each Z mass point, three different samples are simulated, with different values of m a . The average of the three measured Z widths for each of the m a points simulated is taken as the width for a given m Z , and these values are used for the three-photon resonance search, interpolating for m Z points between those for which samples are simulated.

The widths of the Gaussian signal component -corresponding to the detector resolution -are taken from simulated samples of a Higgs boson decaying to four photons via a pair of intermediate pseudoscalar a particles, and vary from 0.6 GeV < \u03c3 Gauss < 3.2 GeV for 10 GeV < m a < 440 GeV, and are largely independent of m h/H . No excess above background is detected, and upper limits, for a SM-like Higgs boson of m h = 125 GeV (and assuming kinematics associated only with gluon fusion SM Higgs boson production), are calculated. Additionally, limits are set for Higgs boson-like scalars with masses larger than 125 GeV. The results of these resonance searches are shown in Fig. 4 for the SM-like Higgs boson of m h = 125 GeV (in the top row) and, as an example of a higher scalar mass, for m H = 600 GeV (in the bottom row). The resonance search limits for higher values of m H are limited by the small number of events in the mass spectra at higher values of m 2\u03b3 .",
