The theoretical description of charm-meson decays is challenging. The charm quark is not heavy enough for a reliable application of the factorisation approach and heavy-quark expansion tools, successfully used in B-meson decays. It is also not light enough for the application of chiral perturbation theory, as in the case of kaon decays. Phenomenological models and approximate symmetries, such as those based on the diagrammatic approach [1,2], rely on the knowledge of branching fractions and, in the case of multi-body final states, resonant structures, as key inputs. Whilst the branching fractions of some decay modes of charmed mesons are well measured, the uncertainties on branching fractions of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays are still large.",

At the hardware-trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. In the offline selection, the hardware trigger signals are associated with reconstructed particles. Selection requirements can therefore be made on whether the decision is due to the signal candidate, other particles produced in the pp collision, or a combination of both. The latter is used in this analysis. The software trigger is divided into two parts. The first part employs a partial reconstruction of the tracks, and a requirement on p T and IP is applied to, at least, one final-state track forming the D + (s) candidate. In the second part a full event reconstruction is performed and dedicated algorithms are used to select D + (s) candidates decaying into three charged hadrons. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [9] with a specific LHCb configuration [10]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [11], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [12]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [13] as described in ref. [14].",

The two Crystal Ball functions, CB 1 and CB 2 , have widths R 1 \u03c3 G and R 2 \u03c3 G , and tail parameters \u03b1 1 , N 1 and \u03b1 2 , N 2 . A common parameter, \u00b5, describes the most probable mass value of the two Crystal Balls and the mean of the Gaussian function.The fractions of each PDF component aref G for the Gaussian function, (1 \u2212 f G ) \u00d7 f CB for CB 1 and (1 \u2212 f G ) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 f CB ) for CB 2 . The parameters \u03b1 i , N i , R i , fCB and f G defining the signal PDF are fixed to the values obtained from a fit to the simulation sample. The position of the signal mass peak presents a small dependence on the charge of the D + (s) meson and on the magnet polarity. Therefore, the samples are divided into four subsamples to ensure a precise determination of the yields.Due to the large size of the samples of CF channels D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , D + s \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + and for the CS channel D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + , the convergence and goodness of the fit are sensitive to the momentum-dependent resolution of the D + (s) candidate, making it difficult to fit these samples with a single set of parameters. For this reason, the D+ \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + (D + s \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + )samples are further divided into 50 (20) bins of D +(s) momentum. The variation of \u03c3 G over the momentum bins is of the order of 50%. For each magnet polarity, the total signal yield, shown in table 3, is the sum of the yields in the different subsets. For illustration purposes, the invariant-mass distribution for each of the DCS decay modes and for the CS channel are shown infigure 3for the whole sample, summing also over the two magnet polarities, with the associated fit results superimposed. The mass distributions for the CF normalisation modes are shown infigure 4.The observed signal yields in bins of the DP, N obs i in eq. (3.2), are determined using the sPlot technique[20]. For each data subset, the signal and background sWeights are -8 -",
