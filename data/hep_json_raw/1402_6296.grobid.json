The effect of adding the new 2009 \u03c0 0 data to a recent global analysis of polarized scattering data is also shown, resulting in a best fit value \u0394G \u00bd0.05;0.2 DSSV \u00bc 0.06 \u00fe0.11   \u22120.15 in the range 0.05 < x < 0.2, with the uncertainty at \u0394\u03c7 2 \u00bc 9 when considering only statistical experimental uncertainties. Shifting the PHENIX data points by their systematic uncertainty leads to a variation of the best-fit value of \u0394G \u00bd0.05;0.2 DSSV between 0.02 and 0.12, demonstrating the need for full treatment of the experimental systematic uncertainties in future global analyses.",

(3), including a final state hadron or jet, as well as rarer probes such as direct photon and heavy flavor [21]. The latter of these are produced through fewer processes, which allows for a simple leading-order interpretation of the results. Jets or low-mass hadrons such as pions are not as readily interpretable due to the multiple QCD processes through which they are produced, but they have significantly higher production rates. PHENIX results for A \u03c0 0 LL [16,20,22] and results for jet A LL from the STAR experiment at RHIC [18,23] have ruled out large values of \u0394G but are still consistent with a range of assumptions, including fixing the polarized PDF for the gluon, \u0394g\u00f0x; \u03bc 2 \u00de, to zero at an NLO input scale of \u03bc 2 \u00bc 0.40 GeV 2 . The constraining power of these results has been quantified via inclusion in a global fit of polarized DIS and semi-inclusive DIS results by de Florian et al. (DSSV) [9,10], resulting in an integral \u0394G The A \u03b7 LL has also been measured [17], but it has not yet been used in global fits. One reason for this is that existing e \u00fe \u00fe e \u2212 data does not constrain \u03b7 fragmentation functions as well as those for the pions [24,25]. However, PHENIX has released results for the \u03b7=\u03c0 0 cross section ratio in p \u00fe p collisions [17,26] with systematic uncertainties much smaller than on either cross section measurement alone. Future inclusion of this ratio in global fits could be used to circumvent this issue with the fragmentation functions.",

This allows an unambiguous definition of 120 \"crossings\" per revolution at each experiment, with a 106 ns separation.

The polarization for each bunch can be aligned or antialigned with this vertical axis at injection, allowing for variation over all four possible polarization combinations within four crossings, or 424 ns. To cancel false asymmetries related to coupling between the polarization patterns and the bunch/crossing structure, four different polarization vs bunch patterns, hereafter referred to as \"spin patterns,\" were used, defined by changing the sign of all polarizations in one or both beams from the base pattern. The patterns were cycled after each successful beam store, or \"fill.\" Determination of the beam polarizations required combining measurements from two separate polarimeters. First, the relative beam polarizations were measured several times per fill using a fast, high-statistics relative polarimeter, which detects elastic scattering off of a thin carbon target that is moved across the beam. This polarimeter can determine both the relative magnitude of the polarization and any variation across the width of the beam [28]. This measurement was normalized by comparing its average over the entire data set to the average of an absolute polarization measurement from the second polarimeter, which is based on scattering of the beam with a continuously running polarized hydrogen gasjet target [29]. For 2009 ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 200 GeV running, the average beam polarizations were P B \u00bc 0.56 for the blue beam and P Y \u00bc 0.55 for the yellow beam, for a product P B P Y \u00bc 0.31. The overall relative scale uncertainty on the product P B P Y was 6.5%, with 4.8% of that considered correlated with the polarization uncertainties from RHIC runs in 2005 and 2006 [30].",

It is used in conjunction with the ZDC to measure an azimuthal asymmetry in forward neutron production with a magnitude of 0.07 [35] during transverse polarization running (with the spin rotators turned off). This asymmetry should vanish when the beam polarization vector is perfectly longitudinal. The size of the residual asymmetry can therefore be used to determine the remaining transverse component, and thus the degree of effective longitudinal polarization. ",

Due to the long decay time of an EMCal signal, any energy deposit occurring in the three previous crossings is read out. Pileup is negligible due to the fine lateral segmentation of the EMCal, so only the combinatorial background is affected.

The cut also reduces the contribution of clusters from previous crossings. Even though the circular buffering in the EMCal readout makes the ToF measurement insensitive to timing offsets that are multiples of the beam-crossing period, the fact that different crossings have independent t 0 effectively smears the ToF distribution further.

We choose the ZDC for comparison because, in addition to having a different geometrical acceptance (see Sec. II B), it samples a significantly different class of events than the BBC. The BBC fires predominantly on charged particles and is dominated by low-p T soft physics, whereas the ZDC samples mainly diffractive physics and, due to its location behind the accelerator's bending magnets, which sweep away most charged particles, fires on neutrons, photons, and hadronic showers from scattered protons interacting with the machine elements. The asymmetries in the different physics sampled by the ZDC and the BBC cannot be directly calculated. However, comparing these two detectors with different physics sensitivities increases the likelihood that any nonzero asymmetries would be apparent. Table III lists the measured asymmetries for three years of longitudinally polarizedp \u00fep running at RHIC. For each measurement, a crossing-to-crossing correction for smearing due to the \u223c30 cm online position resolution of the ZDC was applied but found to have little effect on the central A R LL value or its total uncertainty. Given that A R LL is significantly higher for the present (2009) data, an additional cross-check was performed there, motivated by the increased instantaneous luminosity delivered in 2009: the calculation of A R LL using an alternate definition for the luminosities sampled by the BBC and ZDC. The issue is that for any simple trigger that returns only one bit of information (yes or no), the ratio of triggered events to totalp \u00fep collisions tends to decrease with rate as multiple collisions in a single crossing become more common. For the BBC, which, accounting for acceptance and efficiency, has a 55% AE 5% chance to detect a single inelastic p \u00fe p collision, this was the dominant effect in the 2009 run. The ZDC has a much lower efficiency, and here the dominant rate effect was instead the increased likelihood of coincidence for unrelated background events in the two arms, which lead to an increased overcounting of thep \u00fep collisions. Using a set of scaler boards that were under commissioning during (and thus not available over the entirety of) the 2009 run, correlations between hits in the two arms were counted in each crossing and used to calculate the quantity",

This allowed us to produce, for the various \"peak\" and \"sideband\" regions, simulated distributions for A LL , \u03b4A LL , and \u03c7 2 from a fit of A LL across RHIC fills. The result of this test was that the uncertainties were being underestimated above p T \u2248 7 GeV=c for the sideband region and overestimated at low p T for both regions. The sideband region underestimation was traced to low background statistics at high p T resulting in the violation of Gaussian distribution assumptions for error propagation. Since the background fraction w BG is small at high p T , this effect is negligible in the final result. The overestimation of uncertainties at low p T is due to conservative calculation of uncertainties in the cases where triggers were scaled to match the data acquisition bandwidth. For the \u03c0 0 , the largest overestimation was about 6% of the statistical uncertainty, for the signal region in the lowest p T bin.",

We also ran an updated version of the DSSV08 analysis to include final versions of the RHIC data through 2006 [18,20,22] along with the final A \u03c0 0 LL results presented here.

The full \u0394\u03c7 2 curve from our updated analysis is shown as the central curve in Fig. 15(b).

Systematic uncertainties for the RHIC data set were not included in the DSSV08 analysis. However, the PHENIX relative-luminosity systematic uncertainty now exceeds the statistical uncertainty on A \u03c0 0 LL in the lowest p T bins. To understand the impact of this on the fit result, we shifted the PHENIX ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 200 GeV data up and down by the systematic uncertainties given in the final column of Table VI, while ignoring the systematic uncertainties of all other data sets. As demonstrated in Fig. 15, this changes the global best-fit value to 0.12 or 0.02, with the value preferred by the PHENIX data changing to 0.17 or \u22120.03. It is therefore necessary to include this uncertainty in future global analyses to obtain accurate determinations of \u0394G.",

These results are compared with various existing DIS and SIDIS global analyses [ 11,12,[37][38][39] and found to be consistent within the fit uncertainties. We also find consistency with the DSSV08 global analysis [9,10], which includes versions of earlier PHENIX measurements. Addition of our new results to that analysis (as well as the updating of previous RHIC data [18,20,22]) yields a statistical-uncertainty only constraint of \u0394G DSSV08 from 0.02 to 0.12. A significant effort by the RHIC experiments to understand and correct for the relative-luminosity systematic effect is also currently underway. Furthermore, for the \u03b7 asymmetries to be used, better determination of \u03b7 fragmentation functions is needed, perhaps using the well-determined \u03c0 0 to \u03b7 crosssection ratio [17,26].",
