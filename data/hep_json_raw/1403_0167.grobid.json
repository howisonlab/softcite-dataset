The 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) invariant mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 1, where the X(1840) can be clearly seen. The parameters of the X(1840) are extracted by an unbinned maximum likelihood fit. In the fit, the background is described by two contributions: the contribution from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and the contribution from other sources. The contribution from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is determined from MC simulation and fixed in the fit (shown by the dash-dotted line in Fig. 2). The other contribution is described by a third-order polynomial. The signal is described by a Breit-Wigner function modified with the effects of the detection efficiency, the detector resolution, and the phase space factor. The fit result is shown in Fig. 2  \u0393 = 83 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 11 MeV, respectively; the product branching fraction of the X(1840) is B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X(1840)) \u00d7 B(X(1840) \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )) = (2.44 \u00b1 0.36 +0.60 \u22120.74 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . In these results, the first errors are statistical and the second errors are systematic. Figure 3 shows the comparisons of the X(1840) with other observations at BESIII. 12 The comparisons indicate that at present one can not distinguish whether the X(1840) is a new state or the signal of a 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decay mode of an existing state.",
