Nevertheless, quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass make it unnatural for the SM to be valid beyond a scale of a few TeV [3,4]. Various dynamical electroweak symmetry-breaking scenarios attempt to solve the naturalness problem by assuming a new strong interaction at a higher scale. These models generically predict the existence of new resonances decaying to a vector boson plus the Higgs boson, as for example in Minimal Walking Technicolour [5-7], Little Higgs [8], or composite Higgs models [9,10].",

As a consequence, the Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks is less likely to be observed as two separate jets than as a single wide jet where the two b-jets are \"merged\" (the Higgs boson candidate). Bottom-quark tagging is used as a means to further purify the event selection. Decays of the Higgs boson to charm quarks are included in the signal Monte Carlo simulation to properly account for the small contribution of b-tagged charm quarks. Together, the reconstructed mass of the Higgs boson candidate jet and the results of the bottom-quark tagging are used to identify likely Higgs boson candidates. The search is performed by examining the distribution of the reconstructed V H mass (m V H ) or transverse mass (m T,V H ) for a localized excess. The signal strength and background normalization are determined from a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the data distribution in each channel and are used to evaluate bounds on the production crosssection times decay branching fraction for V bosons.",

Muons are identified by matching tracks found in the inner detector to either full tracks or track segments reconstructed in the muon spectrometer [46]. Muons are required to pass identification requirements based on quality criteria imposed on the inner detector and muon spectrometer tracks, and, as for electrons, both \"loose\" and \"tight\" operating points are used. Both the electrons and muons are required to have a minimum p T of 7 GeV and to lie within a region with a good reconstruction and identification efficiency (|\u03b7| < 2.7 for muons and |\u03b7| < 2.47 for electrons). They are required to be isolated using requirements on the sum of the p T of the tracks lying in a cone around the lepton direction whose radius, R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 , decreases as a function of the lepton p T , so-called \"mini-isolation\" [47].

Similarly, if a small-R jet is separated by R < 0.4 to the nearest muon candidate, the small-R jet is discarded if it has fewer than three associated inner-detector tracks; otherwise the muon candidate is removed.

The 0-lepton channel has a non-negligible acceptance for the W \u2192 W H \u2192 \u03bdbb signal in events in which the lepton is not detected or is a hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton; it also has smaller predicted backgrounds than the 1-lepton channel. For this reason, the 0-lepton channel and the 1-lepton channel are combined in the W search.

These triggers are complemented with non-isolated ones with higher p T thresholds. The 1-lepton channel uses the single-electron triggers for the electron channel and a combination of the E miss T trigger and single-muon trigger for the muon channel, where the E miss T trigger considers only the energy of objects in the calorimeter, and thus muons are seen as a source of E miss T .

Two benchmark models derived by tuning the HVT coupling parameterization [11] are used here. In the first, referred to as Model A (g V = 1, c H = \u22120.55, c F \u223c 1), the branching fractions to fermion pairs and to the heavy SM bosons are comparable, as in some extensions of the SM gauge group [12].",

Finally, only in the search for Z \u2192 Z H, events containing one or more identified hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton candidates are rejected; this veto reduces the total expected W +jets and tt contribution by 18.5% and has a negligible impact on the Z acceptance.

To reduce the multi-jet background from non-prompt leptons or from jets faking leptons, the lepton must satisfy the tight quality criteria. Additional requirements on the sums of calorimeter energy deposits and track transverse momenta in a cone with radius R = 0.2 around the lepton direction are applied such that 95% of leptons in Z \u2192 events are accepted [45,46]. The event must also have significant missing transverse momentum: E miss T > 100 GeV. To reconstruct the invariant mass of the candidate W H \u2192 \u03bdbb system in the 1-lepton channel, the momentum of the neutrino in the z-direction, p z , is obtained by imposing the W boson mass constraint on the lepton-neutrino system. In the resulting quadratic equation, p z is taken as either the real component in the case of complex solutions or the solution with the smaller absolute value is chosen if both solutions are real. Events containing exactly two loose leptons of the same flavour with p T > 25 GeV (and with |\u03b7| < 2.5 for muons) are assigned to the 2-lepton channel. Due to the potential charge ambiguity for highly boosted leptons, no opposite charge requirement is imposed. Only loose track isolation requirements are applied since this channel has negligible background from fake and non-prompt leptons. The invariant mass of the two leptons, m , must be in the range 70-110 GeV for the dielectron selection. This range is widened to 55-125 GeV for the dimuon selection due to the poorer momentum resolution at high p T . To improve the m VH resolution of Z H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bcbb events, the four-momentum of the dimuon system is scaled by m Z /m \u03bc\u03bc , where m Z = 91.2 GeV and m \u03bc\u03bc is the invariant mass of the dimuon system.",
