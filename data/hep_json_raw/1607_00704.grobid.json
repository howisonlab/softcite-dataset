We have produced a flux prediction which uses all available and relevant hadron production data, incorporating measurements of particle production off of thin targets as well as measurements of particle yields from a spare NuMI target exposed to a 120 GeV proton beam. The result is the most precise flux prediction achieved for a neutrino beam in the one to tens of GeV energy region.",

            "text": "Precise knowledge of the neutrino flux created by an accelerator is important for precision neutrino oscillation and interaction experiments. Conventional neutrino beams, such as the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermilab, are created by directing high energy protons onto a target (usually made of carbon or beryllium) so as to produce \u03c0 and K mesons. Those mesons are magnetically focused into a long tunnel in which they decay (for example, \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 \u00b5 + ), producing neutrinos. In principle, precise knowledge of \u03c0 and K production cross-sections on the target material, and of the focusing properties of the beamline, should translate into a well known neutrino flux. In practice the situation is more complicated, since there are often multiple interactions within the target and in the materials downstream of it. Also, the meson production process is governed by non-perturbative QCD and occurs in a nucleus, so highly accurate, first principle, theoretical predictions are not available. Neutrino experiments have usually dealt with this situation by producing detailed simulations of the beamline materials and geometry coupled with phenomenological models of hadronic cascades, such as those in Geant4 [1] and FLUKA [2,3]. Those models are not necessarily accurate but can be tuned or benchmarked by comparing their predictions to measurements of hadron production. Recent measurements of pion production on a thick (two interaction length) carbon target have been released by MIPP [4], and measurements of pion production on a thin (few percent interaction length) carbon target are available from NA49 [5]. In addition, there are several other hadron production measurements on various materials, using both proton and pion beams, that can be used to constrain a neutrino beamline simulation.",

Unfortunately, there is little applicable data for the 10-40 GeV mesons of interest here. We estimate the uncertainty by noting that Geant4-FTFP is a microphysical, first principles model of hadronic interactions. Our ansatz is that the level of agreement between FTFP and existing hadron production datasets is indicative of FTFP's ability to model interactions for which no data is currently available. Meson and nucleon production measurements exist for p C and, more generally, for p A interactions. That data agrees with the simulation at better than 40% across a broad range of relevant kinematics. We assume that this verifies the FTFP model at the 40% level. In addition, we note that the observed data-simulation discrepancies for production of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , n and p do not appear to be correlated in any obvious way. Therefore, to handle meson incident interactions we categorize the interactions based on incident particle (\u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 ) and produced particle (\u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , n, p).

As shown in Fig. 4, the carbon in the target is (by design) the most frequently encountered material, with protons typically traversing \u223c 6 mol/cm 2 \u2248 40 cm. Pions and kaons also travel through a significant amount of carbon as they leave the target, and then later encounter aluminum in the horns, helium in the decay pipe volume, and iron in the decay pipe walls. The flux uncertainty is impacted by imperfect modeling of nucleon and meson absorption crosssections, \u03c3 abs , in those materials. Uncertainties in \u03c3 abs translate into uncertainties on the rate of interactions and the location of those interactions in the beamline. The position of interactions in the target is especially critical since that influences the focusing of the produced particles.",

For C, He, Al, and Fe we compute the appropriate probabilities using \u03c3 abs from both the data and simulation and assign the ratio as a weight. Absorption from other materials is negligible. In the thin target prediction the way in which NA49's measurement depends on \u03c3 inel was removed in the computation of f Data so as to avoid double counting that uncertainty at this stage. For the thick target prediction, the initial p C interaction in the target is reweighted according to the formula above, but a correction is made to assure that the average weight does not deviate from unity. This avoids altering the yields, since that would double count the uncertainty already incorporated in the MIPP uncertainties, but allows the average position of interactions along the target to vary.",

The measured rate is in good agreement with both the thin-and thick target predictions, mostly because the LE flux is peaked in the range 2 < E \u03bd < 5 GeV where the two predictions differ by less than the statistical precision of the \u03bde \u2212 scattering measurement.",

MINERvA's published cross-section results have used early forms of this prediction which are now superseded. The flux reported here is the most precise a priori prediction available given the current state of hadron production measurements and the constraints coming from the in situ flux measurements. A previous \"neutrino independent\" constraint that used the NuMI muon monitoring system had uncertainties of 10-25% over the 0-25 GeV range [7]. The uncertainty on the thin target flux prediction is 7.8% when the flux is integrated from 0 to 20 GeV. Hadron production uncertainties dominate the flux uncertainty, except in the region around 5 GeV where beam focusing uncertainties are important. The uncertainty on the thick target flux integrated over the same range is 5.4%, demonstrating the value of dedicated hadron production measurements using actual or replica targets. We hope that this will encourage the community to make such measurements for future neutrino beams.",
