The double differential cross-sections of prompt and nonprompt J /\u03c8 production are measured as a function of the J /\u03c8 transverse momentum and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame. Forward-to-backward ratios and nuclear modification factors are determined. The results are compared with theoretical calculations based on collinear factorisation using nuclear parton distribution functions, on the colour glass condensate or on coherent energy loss models.",

The theoretical understanding of the bound-state dynamics of quarkonium by means of lattice QCD and effective field theories has progressed substantially in the last 30 years. In heavy-ion collisions, the emerging picture indicates strong modifications of the quarkonium bound-state characteristics [2]. Experimentally, measurements at the SPS, RHIC and LHC revealed interesting patterns [3]. In particular, an additional low transverse momentum (p T ) component of J /\u03c8 production was observed in PbPb collisions at the LHC [4][5][6][7][8]. This observation had been predicted as a sign of charmonium originating from unbound charm quarks, generated either during the lifetime of the deconfined medium [9] or at the phase boundary [10].",

            "text": "The limited understanding of nuclear phenomena unrelated to deconfinement, commonly called cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, restricts the ability of phenomenological models to describe the experimental data on J /\u03c8 production in PbPb collisions. The size of CNM effects can be quantified by measurements in protonnucleus or deuteron-nucleus collisions, which have been pursued at fixed target experiments as well as at RHIC and LHC [3]. The feature of CNM drawing the highest attention for proton-lead collisions at the LHC is the modification of the gluon flux coupling to the charm quark pair. This modification is often treated within a collinear parton distribution framework employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) [11][12][13][14][15]. At low longitudinal mo-mentum fractions x carried by the parton, calculations within the colour glass condensate (CGC) effective field theory, describing the saturation regime of QCD [16,17], are frequently employed. Several calculations have been pursued to quantify nuclear modifications of J /\u03c8 production in the collinear framework [18][19][20][21] or in the CGC framework [22][23][24]. It has to be noted that the low-x gluon content of the nucleus is largely unconstrained by experimental data at perturbative scales. In addition, small-angle gluon radiation taking into account interference between initial and final state radiation, called coherent energy loss, was proposed as the dominant nuclear modification of quarkonium production in proton-lead collisions [25]. The discrimination between these phenomena is a strong motivation for the study of the production of quarkonium as a hard-scale probe of QCD at high density.",

The largest relative values appear at high p T and large rapidities and do not dominate the overall uncertainties. They differ between the pPb and Pbp case due to the different rapidity coverage in the centre-of-mass system. The branching fraction contributes to the cross-section uncertainty with 0.05%. The luminosity measurement uncertainty amounts to 2.6% in pPb and to 2.5% in Pbp collisions.

At backward rapidity, this approach is not available due to the breakdown of the dilute approximation for the partons in the proton. The uncertainties take into account the variation of the charm-quark mass and the factorisation scale. These uncertainties largely cancel in this ratio of cross-sections. The collinear calculations are based on the HELAC-Onia event generator [66,67], tuned to reproduce prompt J /\u03c8 cross-section measurements in pp collision [21] and combined with different sets of nPDFs: nCTEQ15 [14] and EPS09 at leading (LO) and at next-to-leading order (NLO) [12]. However, the large uncertainties reveal the missing experimental constraints on the gluon density in the nucleus at low x probed by the measurements in the LHCb detector acceptance. At backward rapidities, the experimental points are found at the lower bound or slightly below the theoretical uncertainty bands and exhibit a different rapidity shape from the calculations. The coherent energy loss model [25] is able to provide the overall shape of the suppression, but overestimates the experimental data at forward rapidities. The uncertainty of this calculation reflects the allowed variation of the parameterisation of pp data used in the model and the allowed variation of the only free model parameter from fits to other measurements.",

The displayed uncertainties correspond to the uncertainties from the nPDF, which are of similar size to or smaller than the total experimental uncertainties. The p T dependence of the experimental data is described within uncertainties by the model. However, the calculation tends to show larger nuclear modification factors than the data. This tendency is confirmed by the nuclear modification factor as a function of rapidity, where the most precise experimental data points are below the model uncertainty band. Furthermore, at backward rapidity, the slope of the theoretical curve is not seen in the experimental data. Finally, recent measurements have shown that long-range collective effects, which have previously been observed in relatively large nucleus-nucleus collision systems, may also be present in smaller collision systems at large charged-particle multiplicites [71][72][73][74]. If these effects have a hydrodynamic origin, momentum anisotropies at the quark level can arise and may modify the distribution of observed heavy-quark hadrons [75]. However, the expected magnitude of these effects on prompt J /\u03c8 or J /\u03c8 -from-b-hadrons production has not yet been calculated.",

The numerical results are listed in Appendix C. In the R FB ratio, most of the systematic uncertainties cancel. The measurements of R FB at \u221a s N N = 5 TeV [27] are compared with the measurements at 8.16 TeV and are found to be in agreement. They are compared with the theoretical computations based on collinear factorisation with different nPDFs described in the previous section. The calculations with different nPDFs do not fully cover the experimental points within uncertainties in particular at low p T with the exception of the EPS09LO combination, which has considerably larger uncertainties. However, a detailed analysis of theoretical correlations in the p T -dependent R FB may be interesting for future studies in order to quantify more precisely the discrepancies. The coherent energy loss calculation is compared with the rapidity dependence of the experimental data points in Fig. 10. It shows within its small uncertainties a slightly different slope from the experimental data points and predicts larger values in the bin at smallest |y * |.",

In both configurations, the nuclear modification factor approaches unity asymptotically at the highest p T . Theoretical calculations for the nuclear modification factor based on collinear factorisation with different nuclear parton distribution functions, coherent energy loss as well as the colour glass condensate model can account for the majority of the observed dependences. For the first time, beauty-hadron production is measured precisely down to p T = 0 at the LHC in pPb and Pbp collisions. In pPb, a weak suppression at the lowest transverse momenta is observed, whereas in Pbp no significant deviation from unity in the nuclear modification factor is found. This weak modification of beauty production in proton-ion collisions is an important ingredient for the investigation of the modifications of beauty production in heavy-ion collisions. Although the presented measurements have improved precision, it is not possible to single out the main nuclear modification mechanism between different phenomenological approaches for charmonium production in proton-lead collisions at the TeV scale. This measurement of J /\u03c8 production is the first step towards measurements of other charmonium states as well as complementary observables like Drell-Yan production, to improve the understanding of quantum chromodynamics at low x and in dense nuclear environments.
