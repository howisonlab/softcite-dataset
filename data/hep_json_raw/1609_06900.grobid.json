In Pb-Pb collisions this phenomenon has been interpreted as a redistribution of baryons and mesons in momentum, when centrality increases, a consequence of the increased radial flow [5]. The flattening of the (p+p)/\u03c6 ratio as a function of p T in the 0-10% central Pb-Pb collisions is further evidence supporting an hydrodynamical evolution of the system.

It has been shown that the strong suppression of hadron production at high p T observed at the LHC in Pb-Pb collisions is not due to an initial-state effect but may be due to jet quenching in hot QCD matter [7]. In Fig. 2 the R AA as a function of p T for multi-strange baryons in central (0-10%) collisions is shown and compared with those for lighter hadrons (\u03c0, K and p). R AA for \u039e is similar to the one for p, especially at high p T (> 6 GeV/c), while \u03c0 and K at low p T (< 3 GeV/c) follow a clearly different trend, which can be interpreted as a consequence of having different masses in a radial flow scenario. R AA for \u2126 is above unity, which might be the result of the larger strangeness enhancement compared to \u039e [2]. In the right canvas of the same figure, the R pPb as a function of p T in minimum-bias p-Pb collisions is shown for the same particles. In this case, there is no suppression for \u03c0, K and p at high p T (> 6 GeV/c), as verified for unidentified particles [7]. In the so-called Cronin region (2 < p T < 6 GeV/c) an increase of the R pPb with the mass and the strangeness content of the particles is visible.",

            "text": "The strangeness enhancement is known as one of the proposed signatures for the QGP formation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Rafelski and M\u00fcller's expectation, first proposed in 1982 [8], is that QGP formation should lead to a higher abundance of strangeness per participating nucleon than in pp interactions. This phenomenon has been actually observed at SPS [9], RHIC [10] and the LHC [2], and has been found to increase with centrality and with the strangeness content of the particle, and decrease as the centre-of-mass energy increases. Statistical hadronization models based on a grand-canonical approach have been demonstrated to be able to predict particle yield ratios in heavy-ion collisions over a large energy scale [11]. In this description, the energy dependence of strangeness enhancement has been understood as the consequence of a suppression of strangeness production due to the reduced phase-space volume in reference pp collisions (canonical suppression) [12]. At SPS and RHIC the strangeness enhancement has been studied looking at the ratio between the yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions and those in pp interactions at the same energy normalized to the mean number of participants ( N part ). It has been shown that this is not the ideal way to isolate the enhancement component due to strangeness content, since the production rates of charged particles do not scale linearly with N part [13]. A better observable is the ratio to pion yields, shown in Fig. 3 for \u039b, \u039e and \u2126 as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 |\u03b7|<0.5 for Pb-Pb, p-Pb and pp collisions. In the case of multi-strange baryons, the ratio is shown to increase by up to a factor of about 2-3 going from pp collisions to Pb-Pb collisions and is more pronounced for the \u2126; for the \u039b a possible increase is not significant within the systematic uncertainty. It is shown that the predictions from statistical hadronization models using a chemical freezeout temperature of 156 MeV [14,15] are comparable with the ratios measured in the most central Pb-Pb collisions for all the three particles. Looking at the p-Pb data, an increase of the (multi-)strange baryon-to-meson ratios with multiplicity is observed. The increase is seen to be more pronounced for particles with a larger strangeness quantum number. In particular (\u039b+\u039b)/\u03c0 \u00b1 and \u039e \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 ratios slightly exceed the saturation limit observed for Pb-Pb, while the \u2126 \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 ratio is not higher than the one observed in peripheral Pb-Pb. Comparison of hyperon-to-pion ratios as a function of pion multiplicity to the trends observed in statistical hadronisation models, where the local conservation of the strangeness is required (as in a canonical ensemble), indicates that the behaviour is qualitatively consistent with the lifting of canonical suppression with increasing multiplicity [4].",
