            "text": "Double-differential three-jet production crosssections are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the large hadron collider. The measurements are presented as a function of the three-jet mass (m j j j ), in bins of the sum of the absolute rapidity separations between the three leading jets (|Y * |). Invariant masses extending up to 5 TeV are reached for 8 < |Y * | < 10. These measurements use a sample of data recorded using the ATLAS detector in 2011, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.51 fb \u22121 . Jets are identified using the anti-k t algorithm with two different jet radius parameters, R = 0.4 and R = 0.6. The dominant uncertainty in these measurements comes from the jet energy scale. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations corrected to account for non-perturbative effects are compared to the measurements. Good agreement is found between the data and the theoretical predictions based on most of the available sets of parton distribution functions, over the full kinematic range, covering almost seven orders of magnitude in the measured cross-section values.",

            "text": "Collimated jets of hadrons are a characteristic feature of highenergy particle interactions. In the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), jets can be interpreted as the result of fragmentation of partons produced in a scattering process. In high-energy particle collisions two main phases can be distinguished. In the perturbative phase, partons with high-transverse momentum ( p T ) are produced in a hard-scattering process at a scale Q. This phase is described by a perturbative expansion in QCD. In the transition to the second (non-perturbative) phase, these partons e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch emit additional gluons and produce quark-antiquark pairs. The non-perturbative jet evolution is an interplay between the hadronisation process and the underlying event. The hadronisation process governs the transition from partons to hadrons and the underlying event represents initial-state radiation, multiple parton interactions and colour-reconnection effects [1]. In spite of these phenomena, the highly collimated sprays of particles, collectively identified as hadron jets, are observed in the final state. The effects of both hadronisation and the underlying event vary strongly with the jet radius parameter and are most pronounced at low p T . They are accounted for using phenomenological models that are tuned to the data.",

            "text": "The ATLAS Collaboration has measured the inclusive jet cross-sections at 7 TeV [2] and at 2.76 TeV [3] centre-ofmass energies in pp collisions for jets defined by the antik t algorithm [4] with two jet radius parameters, R = 0.4 and R = 0.6. Recent inclusive jet [5] and dijet [6] crosssection measurements at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy in pp collisions have exploited improved jet energy calibration procedures [7] leading to smaller systematic uncertainties compared to those achieved in Refs. [2,3]. Similar measurements at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy in pp collisions [8,9] have been carried out by the CMS Collaboration. These measurements test perturbative QCD (pQCD) at very short distances and have provided constraints on the gluon momentum distribution within protons at large momentum fraction. The impact of higher order effects on the inclusive jet crosssection ratios of anti-k t R = 0.5 and R = 0.7 jets has been studied in [10]. The inclusive three-jet to two-jet ratio [11] is used to determine the strong coupling constant. Theoretical predictions of the multi-jet cross-sections in pp collisions at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy have been tested in Refs. [12,13].",
