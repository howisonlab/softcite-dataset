This analysis is based on a data sample of 657 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB energy-asymmetric e + e \u2212 collider. We fully reconstruct one neutral B meson in the \u03c8(2S)K 0 S CP -eigenstate decay channel, and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified to be either B 0 or B 0 from its decay products. CP violation parameters are obtained from the asymmetries in the distributions of the proper-time intervals between the two B decays: S \u03c8(2S)K 0 S = +0.72 \u00b1 0.09(stat) \u00b1 0.03(syst), A \u03c8(2S)K 0 S = +0.04 \u00b1 0.07(stat) \u00b1 0.05(syst). These results are in agreement with results from measurements of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 . In the standard model, CP violation in B 0 meson decays originates from an irreducible complex phase in the 3 \u00d7 3 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix [1]. In the decay chain \u03a5(4S) \u2192 B 0 B 0 \u2192 f CP f tag , where one of the B mesons decays at time t CP to a CP eigenstate f CP and the other decays at time t tag to a final state f tag that distinguishes between B 0 and B 0 , the decay rate has a time dependence [2] given by P(\u2206t) = e \u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4 B 0 4\u03c4 B 0 1 + q \u2022 S fCP sin(\u2206m d \u2206t)",

The PDF for signal events, P sig (\u2206t), is given by Eq. 1 and modified to incorporate the effect of incorrect flavor assignment; the parameters \u03c4 B 0 and \u2206m d are fixed to their worldaverage values [11]. The distribution is then convolved with a resolution function R sig (\u2206t) to take into account the finite vertex resolution. The resolution function parameters, along with the wrong tag fractions for the six r intervals, w l (l = 1, 6) and possible differences in w l between B 0 and B 0 decays (\u2206w l ) are determined using a high-statistics control sample of semileptonic and hadronic b \u2192 c decays [4,12]. The PDF for non-peaking background events, P bkg (\u2206t), is modeled as a sum of exponential and prompt components and is convolved with a sum of two Gaussians, which parameterizes the resolution function R bkg (\u2206t). Parameters in P bkg (\u2206t) and R bkg (\u2206t) are determined from a fit to the \u2206t distribution of events in the \u2206E-M bc data sideband (M bc < 5.26 GeV/c 2 , \u22120.03 GeV < \u2206E < 0.20 GeV). The PDF for peaking background events, P peak (\u2206t), is the same as P sig (\u2206t) with CP parameters fixed to zero. The term P ol (\u2206t) is a broad Gaussian function that represents an outlier component with a small fraction f ol . The only free parameters in the final fit are S fCP and A fCP ; these are determined by maximizing the likelihood function given by Eq. 2.",

Figure 2 shows the observed \u2206t distributions for q = +1 and q = \u22121 with no requirement on the tagging quality (top), and the raw asymmetry for events with good tagging quality (r > 0.5) (bottom). The systematic errors on S fCP and A fCP , summarized in Table II, are evaluated by fitting the data with each fixed parameter varied by its 1 standard deviation (\u03c3) error. The MC-determined parameters are varied by \u00b12\u03c3 to take into account possible imperfect modeling in the MC. We repeat the CP fit procedure with the new value, add the differences in S, A quadratically, and then assign the result as the systematic error. The largest contribution to S fCP comes from vertex reconstruction (0.026). This includes the uncertainties in the interaction point profile (the smearing used to account for the B flight length is varied by \u221210 \u00b5m and +20 \u00b5m), the tag side track selection criteria, the helix parameter correction, the |\u2206t| range (varied by \u00b130 ps), the vertex quality cut \u03be (changed to \u03be < 150 and \u03be < 500), the \u2206z measurement, and imperfect SVD alignment. The last two are obtained from a study of J/\u03c8K 0 S . Each physics parameter (\u03c4 B 0 , \u2206m d ) is varied by the error in its worldaverage value [11]. Systematic errors due to uncertainties in wrong tag fractions are estimated by varying the parameters w l , \u2206w l in each r region by their \u00b11\u03c3 errors. Systematic errors due to uncertainties in the resolution function are estimated by varying each resolution parameter obtained from data (MC) by \u00b11\u03c3 (\u00b12\u03c3). The \u2206E, M bc parameters and signal fraction in each r region are varied to estimate the systematic errors. No significant bias is seen by fitting a large sample of MC events. The systematic errors from uncertainties in the peaking background are obtained by varying the peaking fraction, shape, as well as its CP asymmetry parameters. The systematic errors from uncertainties in the background \u2206t shape are estimated by varying each background parameter by its statistical error. We also include the effects of interference between CKM-favored and CKM-suppressed B \u2192 D transitions in the f tag final state [18]. We add each contribution above in quadrature to obtain the total systematic uncertainty.",
