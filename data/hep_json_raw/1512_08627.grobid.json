Using a nearly background-free sample of 18262 events, we measure the branching fraction B(D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + e + \u03bde) = (3.77 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.08)%. For 0.8 < mK\u03c0 < 1.0 GeV/c 2 the partial branching fraction is B(D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + e + \u03bde) [0.8,1.0] = (3.39 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.08)%. A partial wave analysis shows that the dominantK * (892) 0 component is accompanied by an S -wave contribution accounting for (6.05 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.18)% of the total rate and that other components are negligible. The parameters of theK * (892) 0 resonance and of the form factors based on the spectroscopic pole dominance predictions are also measured. We also present a measurement of the 22K * (892) 0 helicity basis form factors in a model-independent way.",

            "text": "The semileptonic decay D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + e + \u03bd e , named D e4 decay, has received particular attention due to the relative simplicity of its theoretical description and the large branching fraction. The matrix element of D e4 decay can be factorized as the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents. This makes it a natural place to study the K\u03c0 system in the absence of interactions with other hadrons, and to determine the hadronic transition form factors. In this paper the analysis is done mainly for two purposes:  Traditionally, they are written as linear combinations of 2 vector and axial-vector form factors which are assumed to 3 depend on q 2 according to the spectroscopic pole dominance (SPD) model [5,6]. In this analysis we present two ways to measure them. One way is to use the SPD 6 model to describe the form factors in the partial wave 7 analysis (PWA) framework. Another way is to perform 8 a non-parametric measurement of the q 2 dependence of 9 the helicity basis form factors using a weighting tech-10 nique, free from the SPD assumptions. This study will 11 provide a better understanding of the semileptonic decay 12 dynamics.",

This can be compared with hadronic model expectations and lattice QCD computations [1].

High statistics in this decay allow accurate measurements of the 47K * (892) 0 resonance parameters. Besides this dominant process, both FOCUS and BABAR have observed an S -49 wave contribution with a fraction of about 6% in this 50 D e4 decay [2, 3]. In BABAR's parameterization, the K\u03c0 51 S -wave with the isospin of I = 1/2 was composed of a 52 non-resonant background term and theK * 0 (1430) 0 [3]. 53 The S -wave modulus was parameterized as a polyno-54 mial dependence on the K\u03c0 mass for the non-resonant 55 component and a Breit-Wigner shape for theK * 0 (1430) 0 . 56 The phase was parameterized based on measurements of 57 the LASS scattering experiment [4].

BABAR used it to fit the data over a K\u03c0 invariant 62 mass m K\u03c0 range up to 1.6 GeV/c 2 , showing that this pa-63 rameterization could describe the data well. In addition, 64 they did a model-independent measurement of the phase tem in any of its possible angular momentum states [5].",
