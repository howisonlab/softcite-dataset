            "text": "The \u03b7 decay channels with lepton pairs are closely related to the channels with real photons. The direct consequence of Quantum Electrodynamics is that the process with a real photon should be accompanied by a process where a virtual photon convert internally into a lepton pair. This fact was first pointed out by Dalitz in 1951 [1] and therefore the decays with one or two lepton-antilepton pairs are known as single or double Dalitz decays. Dalitz decays can be related to the corresponding radiative decays using Quantum Electrodynamics and introducing a function of the four momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon (q 2 ): F(q 2 1 , q 2 2 ) -the Form Factor. In case of Dalitz decays q 2 is equal to the invariant mass squared of a lepton pair and q 2 \u2265 4m 2 l . The Form Factor describes the structure of the transition region and it is also used to describe processes where q 2 < 0 (space-like virtual photons). The orientation of the plane defined by the lepton momenta is connected with the polarization of the virtual photon. The diagrams corresponding to the conversion decays of \u03b7 are shown in fig. 1ab. The diagram for the very rare decay into a lepton-antilepton pair P \u2192 l + l \u2212 , presented in fig. 1c, is forbidden to proceed via a single photon intermediate state. The dominant mechanism within the Standard Model is the second order electromagnetic process with two virtual photons P \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 * . In addition the decay is suppressed by helicity conservation. Therefore it is a potentially important channel to look for effects of physics beyond the Standard Model. The imaginary part of the decay amplitude can be exactly related to the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The measured value of \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) gives a lower limit (the unitarity limit) of BR(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 )\u22651.8\u00d710 \u22129 [2,3] which is a much lower value than for other decays of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 into lepton-antilepton pairs. This makes the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay sensitive to contributions from non-conventional effects that would lead to a higher branching ratio. The current experimental upper limit of 7.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (90% CL) obtained by the CLEO II collaboration [4] is four orders of magnitude higher. The real part of the amplitude of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay can be estimated using the measured value of BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) [5,6,7] and gives a prediction for the branching ratio of about 6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 . The estimated BR is based on the assumption that the ratio between Im and Re part of the decay amplitude is the same for e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 .",

An interesting question is how the Form Factor F(q 2 1 , q 2 2 ) behaves as a function of the invariant mass squared of the pairs q 2 . Different forms of this dependence have been proposed, the most common is predicted by the vector meson dominance model. Experimental information for the \u03b7 Dalitz decays are scarce. The branching ratio for \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay is known with rather large error BR=(6.0 \u00b1 0.8)\u00d710 \u22123 [8].

Beam protons with a kinetic energy of 893 MeV interacted with frozen droplets of deuterium [14]. The \u03b7 mesons were produced in the reaction pd \u2192 3 He \u03b7 close to the \u03b7 production threshold. The detection of 3 He ions in a zero-degree spectrometer (tagging detector) provided a clean \u03b7 trigger independent of decay channel. The 3 He ions were identified and their energy was measured which allowed to select cleanly the pd \u2192 3 He \u03b7 reaction with a background of about 1%. The tagging detector provided a few triggers per second (at a luminosity of 5 \u00d7 10 30 cm \u22122 s \u22121 ), yielding on average one recorded \u03b7 event per second. During two weeks of the experiment (distributed over half a year period) nearly 3 \u00d7 10 5 \u03b7 events were collected. The charged \u03b7 decay products are tracked using a cylindrical mini drift chamber (MDC), consisting of 17 layers of thin mylar tubes and built around a beryllium beam pipe with 1.2 mm wall thickness. The MDC is placed inside of a superconducting solenoid which provides a magnetic field of 1T. The MDC is surrounded by a barrel of plastic scintillators. An electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 1012 CsI(Na) crystals measures the energies of photons and impact points. Correlation between momentum, measured from the track curvature in the MDC and energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter permits to distinguish electrons from charged pions if the transverse particle momenta are larger than about 20 MeV/c.",

Dalitz decay of one of the three \u03c0 0 from the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays provides an abundant data set of events with five photons and an electron-positron pair -\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 D . The Dalitz decay of the \u03c0 0 meson has been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally. According to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations already the class of events with more than three neutral clusters is dominated by this decay channel. The invariant mass of the two charged particles for such events is presented in fig. 3a. The peak at low masses can be attributed to the e + e \u2212 pairs from the neutral pion decay. The expected distribution from MC is shown in the same figure with dashed line. The second maximum is due to the decay channels with \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair, mainly \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 (the corresponding histogram in the figure is normalized to the second enhancement). Such interpretation is confirmed by the reconstructed invariant a) b) mass of the e + e \u2212 \u03b3 system (M ee\u03b3 ) where the photon leading to the mass value closest to the \u03c0 0 mass is selected (fig. 3b).

One of the clusters should have energy deposit greater than 200 MeV. More than one cluster is allowed in order not to limit the acceptance for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay, where due to electron or photon interaction in the calorimeter an additional hit cluster can be created. In fig. 4 the experimental M ee distribution is shown together with MC distributions for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay and a background from \u03b7 decays with a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair misinterpreted as electrons. The plot is before identification using conditions on the R p/E variable.  In the final selection of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay candidates it was required additionally that at least one electron is identified using R p/E ratio and M ee < 0.125 GeV/c 2 . In fig. 5 the relative angle between the momentum of the electron-positron pair and the photon momentum is plotted with respect to the invariant mass M ee\u03b3 after the selection of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 candidates. Fig. 6 shows the experimental M ee\u03b3 distribution (points) and the result of the MC simulation of the signal and the background (solid line) after the selection cuts. The origin of the discrepancy between MC and the experimental data in the figure around 0.42 GeV/c 2 is under study. It can be due to the interaction of the beam with rest gas in the beam tube. In a search for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay, events with exactly four tracks in the MDC and equal number of positive and negative charged particles were selected. According to the simulations 11% of the reconstructed \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 events fulfill the following criteria:",
