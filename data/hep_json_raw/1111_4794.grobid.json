It can accelerate protons and deuterons up to about 3.7 GeV/c thus allowing KK production as well as associated strangeness production in pp interactions. Although polarized beams are available, we will concentrate here on experiments making use of unpolarized beams. Excellent beam quality can be achieved using electron-and/or stochastic cooling. COSY can be used as an accelerator for external target experiments and as storage ring for internal target experiments. The strangeness production experiments have been performed at the internal spectrometer ANKE by the COSY-ANKE collaboration, at the internal COSY-11 spectrometer by the COSY-11 collaboration, at the external TOF facility by the COSY-TOF collaboration and at the external BIG KARL spectrometer by the COSY-MOMO and COSY-HIRES collaborations.",

[6]) and a K \u2212 K + = 0.5 4 \u22120.5 + (3 \u00b1 3)i) fm (Ref. [14]). A possible FSI in K + p was found to be of no importance. While the phase in the complex scattering length a K \u2212 p is quite uncertain, |a K \u2212 p | is much better defined (see Fig. and Ref. [6]). The K \u2212 p interaction is quite complex because of the channel couplings to \u03a3\u03c0 and also because there are two isospins I = 0 and I = 1. In a recent study [15], within a chiral SU(3) unitary approach, a 0 = (\u22121.64 + 0.75i) fm and a 1 = (\u22120.06 + 0.57i) fm were obtained. Here the sign convention is that negative scattering length corresponds to repulsion. These values are shown, together with their variances in Fig. 1. Also the experimental result is shown. However, it is unclear in which isospin channel the K \u2212 p system is produced and whether isospin is conserved. However, the isospin mean value and its uncertainty has almost no overlap with the FSI result. The same is true for scattering length values from elastic K \u2212 p scattering. These results from KEK [16] and Daphne [17] are also shown (see Fig. 1). In pd \u2192 K + K \u22123 He reaction no evidence is found for K \u00b13 He FSI. One reason might be that the MOMO experiment [11] did not distinguish between the two kaons leading to an average over the two possible final states.",

The two processes can be distinguished on an invariant mass plot of the two kaons. In Fig. 2 we show the cross section as function of the energy between the  [19] and those labelled MOMO from Ref. [11] two kaons for the reaction pd \u2192 K + K \u22123 He at an energy 40 MeV above threshold. The figure shows in addition to the data [11] the non-resonant fraction as normalized phase space and the resonant fraction by a Gaussian smeared Breit-Wigner distribution as well as the sum of both. It is remarkable that in the case of pp induced reaction always \u03c3 res > \u03c3 nr holds [6]. In the pd induced reaction the opposite is true: \u03c3 res < \u03c3 nr . There is one more distinct difference between both reactions. The data were transformed into the Gottfried-Jackson frame [20]. In this frame, which connects the entrance and exit channels, the total momentum of the K + K \u2212 system is zero, which means that it is the \u03c6 rest frame.",

            "text": "Since the \u03c6 is a vector meson, the distribution in the relative momentum of the kaons from its decay is sensitive to its polarization with respect to some quantization axis. For the pp \u2192 \u03c6pp reaction as well as for the pn \u2192 \u03c6d reaction [9] it is found that m = \u00b11 and hence pseudoscalar meson exchange in the production graph [21]. On the contrary in pd \u2192 \u03c6 3 He the magnetic quantum number is m = 0 and hence vector meson exchange occurred. Why is the production process so different? The pd \u2192 \u03c6 3 He reaction measured was well below the pp \u2192 \u03c6pp production threshold. Therefore, both nucleons in the deuteron had to coherently participate in the reaction. It is surprising that in the pd \u2192 \u03c9 3 He reaction no polarization was found [18]. Another difference between these two reactions is the size of the cross section. From OZI rule a smaller \u03c6 production cross section is expected [22]. In Fig. 2 also the matrix elements squared |f | 2 = d\u03c3/d\u2126/P S 2 with P S 2 the two body phase space for the two reactions pd \u2192 3 He\u03c6, \u03c9 are compared with each other. However, \u03c6 production is larger than predicted by the OZI rule: R \u03c6/\u03c9 = 8 \u00d7 R OZI for pp reactions and only R \u03c6/\u03c9 = 20 \u00d7 R OZI for the pd reaction with R OZI = 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

In a recent high resolution experiment the pp \u2192 K + \u039bp reaction was studied close to the threshold [23]. It is this area which is most sensitive to final state interactions. The analysis yielded almost no spin triplet strength for this reaction. The effective range parameters extracted were a s = \u22122.43 +0. 16 \u22120.25 fm and r s = 2.21 0.16 \u22120.36 fm. The total cross sections for two beam energies were determined [23,24] and are shown in Fig. 3 together with other data from [25][26][27][28][29] and [30]. The data can be described in terms of only three transitions:  Figure 3: Left panel: Excitation functions for the reactions pp \u2192 K + Y 0 p with Y 0 = \u039b (lower frame) and \u03a3 0 (upper frame). The data obtained at COSY are from HIRES [23], [24], COSY11 [25], TOF [26], and ANKE [29], earlier data from [27,28,30]. For curves see text. Right panel: Same as left panel but for \u03a3 + production. The near threshold point (upper right frame) is from TOF [32]. The dotted curves are from Ref. [33]. The total cross sections for the pp \u2192 K + \u03a3 + n reaction are from Refs. [24,29,30,34,35].",

For the production of \u03a3 + hyperons the data situation is less favorable than for the Y 0 cases. There is only one point from TOF close to threshold for pp \u2192 K 0 \u03a3 + p although with extremely small error bar [32]. For the reaction pp \u2192 K + \u03a3 + n there are much more data from Refs. [24,29,34]. However, there is serious disagreement between these data. Shyam [33] predicted in an effective Lagrangian model the near threshold cross sections for these two channels. His prediction is undistinguishable from the fit in the case of pp \u2192 K 0 \u03a3 + p. We further noticed that the ratio between the two channels in his predictions is constant 2.5. The fit curve for pp \u2192 K 0 \u03a3 + p times 2.5 is shown in the lower frame against the pp \u2192 K + \u03a3 + n cross section data. It is below the data from Ref. [34] but higher than the data from [29]. However, it meets the HIRES result and the higher energy data. A factor of 1/2.5 would be  necessary to reproduce the ANKE data [29], but then the high energy data were not met.",

            "text": "An interesting question to be answered by experiments is to what extent nucleon resonances contribute to hyperon production. In Fig. 4 the Dalitz plot of the reaction pp \u2192 K + \u039bp at a beam momentum of 2.85 GeV/c is shown. The data are from TOF [26]. An enhancement in the cross section is visible for the mass m(K + \u039b) \u2248 1.65 GeV/c 2 . The width of the resonance N * (1650) is \u0393 = 0.15 GeV/c 2 . This means that the resonance covers the full allowed kinematical range. Indeed, this resonance was found to dominate the near threshold cross section (see Refs. [26,33]). It is interesting to note that the quantum numbers of this N * resonance are identical to those of the N * (1535): negative parity, spin and isospin 1/2. It plays the same role in kaon production as the N * (1535) in \u03b7 production.",

The first one is p \u039b = \u2212 p K which is the decay if the N * in its rest frame. The Gottfried-Jackson angle \u03b8 GJ is then the angle between the average of beam and target proton direction and the N * direction. The angular dependence of the cross section is shown in the upper frame of the right panel in Fig. 4. An expansion in Legendre polynomials up to second order are sufficient to account for the data. Thus l \u2264 1 and only S 11 , P 11 , and P 13 resonances can contribute. In the case p \u039b = \u2212 p p , shown in the frame below, it is found that only l = 0 and l = 1 contribute in consistency with the finding from the analysis of the excitation function in Fig. 3. It should be stressed that these findings cannot be obtained from a Dalitz plot.",

Such a resonance would have strangeness S = \u22121. Aerts and Dover [36] predicted a spin singlet dibaryon D s between the \u039bp and the \u03a3N thresholds. We searched for such a resonance in \u039bp elastic scattering as well as in FSI (Ref. [37]). We assumed a resonance at 42.5 MeV having a width of 0.50 MeV. Such a resonance could, however, not been seen in the elastic cross sections (see left panel in Fig. 5). This resonance corresponds to a mass of 2.0965 \u00b1 0.5000 MeV/c 2 in FSI. In a previous experiment [28] some structure had been observed. This is not confirmed by the high resolution experiment [37]. A \u03c7 2 analysis leads to upper limits for the cross sections for the pp \u2192 K + D s reaction (see right panel in Fig.  5).",
