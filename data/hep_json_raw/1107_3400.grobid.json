The measured value of the atmospheric neutrino mass splitting is such that current and future accelerator neutrino beams are best tuned to oscillation physics with neutrino energies in the few-GeV region. However, the precision of neutrino interaction cross-sections is not commensurate with the goals of the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments [1,2]. Moreover, recent measurements have exposed serious shortcomings in the current theoretical models describing neutrino-nucleus interactions.",

Many of the form factors can be taken from electron scattering experiments. However, the axial form factor can best be measured at non-zero Q 2 in neutrino scattering. Most experiments assume a dipole form for the axial form factor F A , such that F A (Q 2 ) = F A (Q 2 = 0)/(1 + Q 2 /(M QE A ) 2 ) 2 , and use reconstructed Q 2 distributions to extract a value for the axial mass parameter M QE A . To approximate the nuclear environment, the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model of Smith and Moniz is used by most experiments [4]. This model assumes that nucleons are quasi-free, with an average binding energy and Fermi momentum specific to the particular target nucleus. Pauli blocking is included in the model. Bodek and Ritchie's extension to the relativistic Fermi gas model [5] is employed by some experiments.",

Here we report recent fits for M QE A . MiniBooNE is an 800 t open volume Cherenkov detector. The MiniBooNE CC QE analysis [15] begins by selecting clean muon neutrino events, which are identified by observing the muon's Cherenkov ring followed by the Cherenkov ring produced by the decay electron. Requiring the decay electron be located near the end of the reconstructed muon track yields a high purity \u03bd \u00b5 CC QE sample. Using the full neutrino data set, Mini-BooNE finds more than 140,000 events in the CC QE sample after cuts; this is by far the largest data set recorded at these energies. The largest fraction of background events are charged current single pion (CC 1\u03c0 + ), \u03bd \u00b5 N \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 N \u03c0 + , interactions in which the final state pion is not observed.

            "text": "The NOMAD detector comprised 2.7 t of active drift chamber targets inside a 0.4 T dipole magnet. The excellent resolution provided by the drift chambers allows the analysers to make stringent cuts on particle identification parameters and final state configurations. They select 1-track and 2-track (\u00b5\u2212 p ) \u03bd \u00b5 CC QE event samples. The NOMAD analysis [22] proceeds by using the measured yield of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events, which have a well known cross-section at high energy, to convert the measured yield of CC QE events into a CC QE cross-section measurement in bins of neutrino energy. The measured value of the cross-section in each bin is used to infer the value of M QE A . As cross checks, they also fit the shape of the reconstructed Q 2 to extract M QE A and use the yield of inverse muon decay (IMD) events to normalize the CC QE cross-section. Both cross checks produce consistent values of M QE A . Table 2 summarises the recent measurements of M QE A . We see that the measurements on nuclei in the \u223c1 GeV region are significantly higher than the world average taken from neutrino-deuterium scattering, and also larger than the high energy measurement on carbon made by NOMAD. We stress that the MiniBooNE and MINOS results (as well as the previously published K2K results) are based on fits to the shapes of the Q 2 distributions.",

Charged-current neutrino candidates are selected by matching tracks originating in the fiducial volume of SciBar and penetrating into the MRD; the muons are tagged by their penetration into the MRD. The analysers separate events based on the number of tracks coming out of the neutrino interaction vertex. One track events have no tracks other than the muon candidate. Two track events are separated into \u00b5\u2212p and \u00b5\u2212\u03c0 samples using particle identification based on the energy deposited along the second track. The one-track and \u00b5 \u2212 p samples are predominantly CC QE events, and the \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 sample is predominantly CC 1\u03c0 + events so the analysis constrains the background fraction with data. SciBooNE fits reconstructed p \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b8 \u00b5 distributions in the three data samples (single \u00b5, \u00b5\u2212p and \u00b5\u2212\u03c0 ) simultaneously to extract the CC QE cross section versus neutrino energy [23].",

Interestingly, recent measurements at high energy do not show the same disagreements. To solve this puzzle, there is increasing consensus that the neutrino scattering community needs to provide model-independent measurements of neutrino cross-sections. MiniBooNE has led the way in developing such analyses with Sci-BooNE following suit now as well.
