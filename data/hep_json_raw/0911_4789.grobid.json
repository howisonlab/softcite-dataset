By measuring the K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decay precisely, we can check the consistency against the currently predicted value in the SM. A deviation indicates new physics beyond the SM because of the very small uncertainty in deriving the imaginary part of V td from the branching ratio of the K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decay. The decay K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd is one of the processes expected to have a significant impact on new physics searches because it is an FCNC process that can proceed through loop diagrams, including the interactions at short distance and large mass scales.

Although K 0 L flux is reduced with a pencil beam, it has several advantages. First, the beam hole at the center of the calorimeter, which compromises hermeticity, can be minimized. Secondly, the K 0 L decay vertex position (Z VTX ) can be assumed to be on the beam axis. The vertex position, which is same as the \u03c0 0 decay position due to the short lifetime of \u03c0 0 , is obtained from the kinematics of the two photons from its decay (See Sec. III.B). The transverse momentum of the \u03c0 0 (P T ) with respect to the K 0 L beam axis is also obtained. The signal region for K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decay can be defined with Z VTX and P T . Requiring a sufficiently large missing transverse momentum eliminates contamination from the K 0 L \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay and also reduces the contamination of other K 0 L decays. Most of the K 0 L 's decay into multiple particles that have low momenta in the K 0 L rest frame, and hence low P T in the laboratory frame. The Z VTX should be in the region away from beam counters and P T should be in the range from 120 to 240 MeV/c, where the maximum momentum of \u03c0 0 's in the K 0 L -rest frame is 231 MeV/c for K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd. Production of \u03c0 0 's through beam-gas interactions in the decay fiducial region are reduced by having a high vacuum. Hit-rates of the beam halo (mostly neutrons) with the surrounding detectors are minimized by a sharp collimation of the beam. In addition, as discussed in Sec. III.A and in the subsequent analysis of the data, miscombinations of two photons from background processes and/or mis-measurements of energies and positions were found to be major sources of backgrounds in the E391a experiment. The photons were often produced from interactions of the beam halo and can lead to incorrect determinations of Z VTX . Some backgrounds from beam interactions can be reduced by detecting low-energy deposits from recoil particles emitted after the interactions. More detailed descriptions of the detection method have been reported in the original proposal of E391a [16].",

The inefficiency of photon detection was investigated in a series of experiments [15], which showed that the inefficiency monotonically decreased with the incident photon energy. It was also found that photon detection with a very low energy threshold is necessary to achieve a small overall inefficiency, even for high-energy photons. If an extremely low energy threshold around 1 MeV was set, the backgrounds from other K 0 L decays were reduced to a negligible level within the sensitivity of the experiment.",

The neutral beam was extracted at an angle of 4 \u2022 with respect to the primary proton beam. The target rod and beamline elements were aligned along a straight line in the direction of the neutral beam. The total length of the beamline was 10 m. The neutral beamline consisted of two dipole magnets (D1, D2) to sweep charged particles out of the beam, with field strengths of 4 T\u2022m and 3 T\u2022m, respectively, and six collimators (C1 -C6) to collimate the beam, as shown in Fig. 1.

As shown in Fig. 6, the calorimeter was made of 496 undoped CsI crystals each with a dimension of 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 30 cm 3 (Main CsI) [18] and assembled in a cylindrical shape with an outer diameter of 1.9 m. There was a 12 cm \u00d7 12 cm beam hole at the center of the calorimeter. The beam hole was surrounded by a tungsten-scintillator collar counter (CC03) and 24 CsI modules with dimensions of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 50 cm 3 (KTeV CsI) [19]. The gaps at the periphery of the cylinder were filled with 56 CsI modules with trapezoidal shape and 24 modules of leadscintillator sandwich counters (Lead/Scintillator Sandwich). These modules were tightly stacked such that the gaps between them were less than 0.1 mm. Although the CC03 and the sandwich counters were used only in the veto system, the other parts, which consisted of CsI crystals, were used for photon measurements. The average light yield of the main CsI modules was 16 pe/MeV, where pe/MeV is the unit of the number of photo-electrons emitted from the photomultiplier tube (PMT) cathode for an energy deposit of 1 MeV in the detector. Details of the CsI calorimeter have been reported in Ref. [20].",

The thickness of the MB and FB modules were 13.5X 0 and 17.2X 0 , respectively. The emitted light was transmitted through wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers, which were glued to each scintillator plate with a pitch of 10 mm.

The green light emitted from Y11 was read by a newly developed photomultiplier tube with a high quantum efficiency for green light (EGP-PMT) [24].

Figure 8 shows the light yields for 4 readout channels of one MB module, obtained from a cosmic-ray test. The light yield and attenuation of the FB module were similar to those shown in Fig. 8 for the MB module. Details of the barrel counters has been reported in Ref. [25].

The geometrical acceptance to detect two photons in the CsI was approximately 20%. The loss by veto cuts, or self-vetoing, was about 50%, which was dominated by the CsI and MB vetoes. The loss in the CsI veto was caused by hits accompanied by the genuine photon cluster, as shown in Fig. 23, and the loss in the MB was caused by photons escaping from the front face of the CsI and hitting the MB. The acceptance of the kinematic and signal region selections was approximately 15%. These values were estimated through MC simulations of the K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd mode. The evaluation of the acceptance loss was supported by the fact that the acceptance losses in the normalization modes (K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , and K 0 L \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) were reproduced by the simulation.",

One of the important results is the invariant mass distribution of the events with four photons, shown in Fig. 19. The distribution was well reproduced by the simulations. In particular, the low-mass region was well described by K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays with a small contamination by mis-combination events of four photons from K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays.

Reproduction could not be achieved without good simulations of small signals from the detector, to which a tight veto was applied.
