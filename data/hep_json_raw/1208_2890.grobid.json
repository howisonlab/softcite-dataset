            "text": "The Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model predicts the existence of a fundamental spin-0 particle. Recently, the AT-LAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have observed a particle which is consistent with the predictions for a Standard Model Higgs boson, but its properties remain to be studied [1,2]. In particular, the Standard Model predicts a linear dependence between the Higgs boson couplings to fermions and their mass. This relation could be altered by the presence of new physics. The detailed exploration of the Higgs sector is thus instrumental to our understanding of the fundamental interactions. The compact linear collider (CLIC) is a proposed e + e \u2212 collider with a maximum centre-ofmomentum energy \u221a s = 3 TeV, based on a two-beam acceleration scheme [3]. The Higgs boson production cross section with unpolarised beams is 421 fb in the dominant W-fusion channel. This allows for precision measurements a e-mail: christian.grefe@cern.ch b e-mail: tomas.lastovicka@cern.ch c e-mail: jan.strube@cern.ch of the Yukawa couplings. The beam of the 3 TeV CLIC consists of bunch trains of 312 bunches, which are separated by 0.5 ns. The small beam size and large electric field in the bunches, required to achieve the peak luminosity of 5.9 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , lead to a large cross section of real and virtual two-photon processes that are a background to the processes of interest produced in the electron-positron collision. On average, real beamstrahlung photons produce 3.2 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons events per bunch crossing at \u221a s = 3 TeV. We present simulation studies of the measurements of the branching ratios H \u2192 bb, H \u2192 cc [4] and H \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [5] at such a machine. These studies of the Higgs branching ratios are part of the benchmarking analyses presented in the CLIC Conceptual Design Report [6]. They are carried out in a GEANT4-based simulation [7] of the CLIC_SiD [8] detector concept, with full account of Standard Model backgrounds and using a realistic reconstruction in presence of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background. The latter is reduced partly by removing hits that are out of time with the physics process, partly by advanced off-line reconstruction techniques.",

The branching ratios of a 120 GeV Standard Model Higgs boson are: BR(H \u2192 bb) = 6.48 \u00d7 10 \u22121 , BR(H \u2192 cc) = 3.27 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and BR(H \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = 2.44 \u00d7 10 \u22124 [13]. The events are simulated in the CLIC_SiD detector model using SLIC [14], which is a thin wrapper around GEANT4. They are reconstructed by the algorithms in the org.lcsim [15] and slicPandora [16] packages. Unlike in analyses at lower-energy linear colliders, which use DURHAM-style jet finders that operate on all particles in the event, it was found that the beam-jets of algorithms originally developed for hadron colliders, lead to a crucial improvement of the jet-energy resolution and reduce the effect of the forward-peaking \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons events greatly. In the analysis of Higgs decays to b and c quarks, we use the k t algorithm [17] as implemented by the FASTJET [18,19] package. The LCFI [20] package is used for flavour tagging.

The size parameter R for the jet clustering is 0.7. The presence of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background affects the di-jet mass resolution of the reconstructed Higgs as shown in Fig. 1. The tail towards lower mass values is due to jets in the forward region which are only partly within the detector acceptance. The \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background widens the invariant mass distribution reducing the fraction of events between 90 GeV and 130 GeV from 75 % to 57 %. The peak position is shifted towards higher masses by less than 1 GeV. The LCFI flavour tagging package finds secondary vertices in each jet and uses them, along with complementary track-based information, in a neural network to distinguish b-, c-, and light quark jets. Figure 2(a) shows the mis-tag rate for c-jets and light jets as b-jets versus the b-tag efficiency, while Fig. 2(b) shows the mis-tag rate for b-jets and light jets as c-jets versus the c-tag efficiency. The flavour tagging performance is reduced by the presence of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background. For instance, at the b-tag efficiency of 70 % the mis-tag rate for c-jets (light jets) increases from 4.3 % (0.19 %) without overlay to 6.8 % (0.33 %) with overlay.",

In the latter the electron-positron pair goes in the very forward direction. We have investigated a possible reduction of this background using the forward calorimeters LumiCal and Beam-Cal. The distributions of energy and angle with the outgoing beam axis of the most and second most energetic electrons in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 e + e \u2212 events are shown in Fig. 5. Although most electrons are produced at very low polar angle, a large fraction of the electrons are within the fiducial volumes of the LumiCal and BeamCal, which have an acceptance of 44 mrad and 15 mrad, respectively, with respect to the outgoing beam axis. Since the forward calorimeters were not part of the full detector simulation, we assume ad-hoc electron tagging efficiencies in these two calorimeters to reject background events. Afterwards, a dedicated BDT classifier is trained on the pre-selected background samples using the variables described in Sect. 5.1. For example, assuming an electron tagging efficiency of 95 % in the LumiCal improves the total signal selection efficiency to 49.7 %, which results in a statistical uncertainty on the cross-section times branching ratio measurement of 15.7 %. Assuming a higher electron tagging efficiency of 99 % in the LumiCal improves this result to approximately 15 %. If the BeamCal is used in addition, assuming an average electron tagging efficiency of 70 % in its fiducial volume, the statistical uncertainty can be improved to 14.5 %. An independent study [23] of the electron tagging efficiency in the forward calorimeters at a CLIC detector, taking into account the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons background as well as e + e \u2212 -pair background, confirms the efficiencies we assume here.",
