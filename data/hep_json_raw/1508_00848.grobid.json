Charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.7 are reconstructed using the ATLAS pixel detector. The p + Pb collision centrality is characterised by the total transverse energy measured in the Pb-going direction of the forward calorimeter. The charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions are found to vary strongly with centrality, with an increasing asymmetry between the proton-going and Pb-going directions as the collisions become more central. Three different estimations of the number of nucleons participating in the p + Pb collision have been carried out using the Glauber model as well as two Glauber-Gribov inspired extensions to the Glauber model. Charged-particle multiplicities per participant pair are found to vary differently for these three models, highlighting the importance of including colour fluctuations in nucleon-nucleon collisions in the modelling of the initial state of p + Pb collisions.",

In particular, p + A measurements can provide insight into the effect of an extended nuclear target on the dynamics of soft and hard scattering processes and subsequent particle production. Historically, measurements of the average charged-particle multiplicity as a function of pseudorapidity, dN ch /d\u03b7, where pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2) with \u03b8 the particle angle with respect to the beam direction, have yielded important insight into soft particle production dynamics in proton-and deuteron-nucleus ( p/d + A) collisions [3][4][5][6][7][8] and provided essential tests of models of inclusive soft hadron production.",

Previous measurements in d + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [9] have characterised the centrality using particle multiplicities at large pseudorapidity, either symmetric around mid-rapidity [10] or in the Au fragmentation direction [11]. These measurements have shown that the rapidityintegrated particle multiplicity in d + Au collisions scales with the number of inelastically interacting, or \"participating\", nucleons, N part . This scaling behaviour has been interpreted as the result of coherent multiple soft interactions of the projectile nucleon in the target nucleus, and is known as the wounded-nucleon (WN) model [12]. The charged-particle multiplicity distributions as a function of pseudorapidity measured in central d + Au collisions are asymmetric and peaked in the Au-going direction [7]. This observation has been explained using well-known phenomenology of soft hadron production [13].",

Measurements of the centrality dependence of dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions in p + Pb collisions provide an essential test of soft hadron production mechanisms at the LHC. Such tests have become of greater importance given the observation of two-particle [18][19][20][21] and multi-particle [21][22][23] correlations in the final state of p + Pb collisions at the LHC. These correlations are currently interpreted as resulting from either initial-state saturation effects [15,24,25] or from the collective dynamics of the final state [26][27][28][29][30].

A key parameter of such models is the inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross-section, which is taken to be 70 mb for this analysis [31]. However, the Glauber multiple-scattering approximation assumes that the nucleons remain on the mass shell between successive scatterings, and this assumption is badly broken in ultra-relativistic collisions.

            "text": "A particular implementation of the Glauber-Gribov approach is provided by the colour-fluctuation model [34][35][36][37]. That model accounts for event-to-event fluctuations in the configuration of the incoming proton that are assumed to be frozen over the timescale of a collision and that can change the effective cross-section with which the proton scatters off nucleons in the nucleus. These event-by-event fluctuations in the cross-section can be represented by a proba-bility distribution P(\u03c3 ). The width of that distribution can be characterised by a parameter \u03c9 \u03c3 , which is the relative variance of the \u03c3 distribution, \u03c9 \u03c3 \u2261 (\u03c3/\u03c3 tot \u2212 1) 2 . The usual total cross-section, \u03c3 tot , is the event-averaged crosssection, or, equivalently, the first moment of the P(\u03c3 ) distribution, \u03c3 tot = \u221e 0 d\u03c3 P(\u03c3 ) \u03c3 . The parameter \u03c9 \u03c3 can be measured using diffractive proton-proton scattering at high energy [35,36]. First estimates of \u03c9 \u03c3 at LHC energies [36] extrapolated to 5 TeV yielded \u03c9 \u03c3 \u223c 0.11, while a more recent analysis suggested \u03c9 \u03c3 \u223c 0.2 [37]. Because the crosssection fluctuations in the Glauber-Gribov colour-fluctuation (GGCF) model may have a significant impact on the interpretation of the results of this analysis, the geometry of p + Pb collisions has been evaluated using both the standard Glauber model and the GGCF model with \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.11 and 0.2.",

Since the com-position of the events in the most peripheral 90-100 % interval is not well constrained, these events are excluded from the analysis. The nominal centrality intervals were defined after accounting for a 2 % inefficiency, as described in the \"Appendix\", for the fiducial class of p + Pb events defined above to pass the applied event selection. Alternate intervals were also defined by varying this estimated inefficiency to 0 and 4 %, and is used as a systematic check on the results. While the inefficiency is confined to the 90-100 % interval, it influences the E Pb T ranges associated with each centrality interval. Potential hard scattering contributions to E Pb T have been evaluated in a separate analysis [52] by explicitly subtracting the contributions from reconstructed jets that fall partly or completely in the Pb-going FCal acceptance. That analysis showed negligible impact from hard scattering processes on the measured E Pb T distribution. To test the sensitivity of the results to the choice of pseudorapidity interval used for the E T measurement, two alternative E T quantities are defined.

To address this problem, the tracklet algorithm is used in two different implementations referred to as \"Method 1\" and \"Method 2\". In Method 1, at most one tracklet is reconstructed for each cluster on the first pixel layer. If multiple clusters on the second pixel layer fall within the search region, the resulting tracklets are merged into a single tracklet. This approach reduces, but does not eliminate, the contribution of fake tracklets that are then accounted for using an MC-based correction. Method 2 reconstructs tracklets for all combinations of clusters in only two pixel layers, the innermost and the next-toinnermost detector layers. To account for the fake tracklets arising from random combinations of clusters, the same anal-ysis is performed after inverting the x and y positions of all clusters on the second layer with respect to the primary vertex",

Outside those lines, the contributions from secondary and fake tracklets are more difficult to take into account, especially in the endcap region. These contributions partially arise from lowp T particles on spiral trajectories and their description in the MC simulation is therefore very sensitive to the amount of detector material. The ratio between simulation and the data is also shown for each plot. These ratios are closer to unity in the barrel region than in the endcap region, where they deviate by up to 5 % except at very low | \u03c6|. At low | \u03c6| corresponding to high p T , the MC deviates from the data even after reweighing procedure based on pixel tracks.

To determine the systematic uncertainties, the analysis is repeated in full for different variations of parameters or methods and the results are compared to the standard Method 1 results.

In collisions that are more central, the shape of dN ch /d\u03b7 becomes progressively more asymmetric, with more particles produced in the Pb-going direction than in the proton-going direction. To investigate further the centrality evolution, the dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions in each centrality interval are divided by the dN ch /d\u03b7 distribution for the 60-90 % interval. The results are shown in Fig. 8, where the double-peak structure disappears in the ratios. The ratios are observed to grow nearly linearly with decreasing pseudorapidity, with a slope whose magnitude increases from peripheral to central collisions. In the 0-1 % centrality interval, the ratio changes by almost a factor of two over the measured \u03b7-range. The greatest increase in multiplicity between adjacent centrality intervals occurs between the 1-5 and 0-1 % intervals. Averaged over the \u03b7-interval of the measurement, the dN ch /d\u03b7 distribution increases by more than 25 % between the 1-5 and 0-1 % intervals. In addition to the results presented in Figs. 7 and 8, the dN ch /d\u03b7 measurement is repeated using the alternative definitions of the event centrality variables defined in Sect. 5. centrality definition, the dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions change in an approximately \u03b7independent fashion by \u22123 and +3 % for the 0-1 and 60-90 % intervals, respectively. The dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions in the other centrality intervals change in a manner that effectively interpolates between these extremes. As a result, the increase in dN ch /d\u03b7 between the most peripheral and most central collisions would be reduced by 6 % relative to the nominal measurement. Using the symmetric, E  Fig. 9 Ratios of dN ch /d\u03b7 obtained using alternative centrality definitions to the nominal results presented in this paper as a function of \u03b7 for the 0-1 and 60-90 % centrality bins in an \u03b7-dependent way such that the ratio is consistent with a linear function of \u03b7. The change is at most 6 % at the ends of the \u03b7 range in the most central and most peripheral centrality intervals, and smaller elsewhere. Thus, for the symmetric centrality selection the ratios in Fig. 8 for the 0-1 % bin would increase by 9 % at \u03b7 = 2.7, and decrease by 6 % at \u03b7 = \u22122.7. Generally, the alternative centrality definitions considered in this analysis yield no qualitative and only modest quantitative changes in the centrality dependence of the dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions. These variations should not be considered a systematic uncertainty on the dN ch /d\u03b7 measurement but do indicate that the particular centrality method used in the analysis must be accounted for when interpreting the results of the measurement. Figure 10 shows a comparison, where possible, of the measurements presented in this paper to results from the ALICE experiment [31] using a centrality definition that is based on the detector covering the pseudorapidity region \u22125.1 < \u03b7 < \u22122.8, similar to the E Pb T -based selection used in this measurement. The ATLAS results for 0-1 and 1-5 % centrality intervals are combined to match the ALICE experiment result for 0-5 % interval. Similarly, the 20-30 and 30-40 % intervals are combined to match the ALICE experiment result for 20-40 % interval. The results from the two experiments are consistent with each other.",

            "text": "A common way of representing the centrality dependence of particle yields in A+A and p+A collisions is by showing the Charged-particle pseudorapidity distribution dN ch /d\u03b7 measured in different centrality intervals compared to similar results from the ALICE experiment [31] using the \"V0A\" centrality selection. The ATLAS centrality intervals have been combined, where possible, to match the ALICE centrality selections yield per participant or per participant pair, N part /2, which is determined for each centrality interval and each geometrical model as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 11 shows dN ch /d\u03b7 per participant pair for the most central and most peripheral intervals of centrality measured as a function of \u03b7 for three different models of the collisions geometry: the standard Glauber model and the GGCF model with \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.11 and 0.2 in the top, middle and lower panels, respectively. The results for the most peripheral (60-90 %) centrality interval, shown with circles, are similar between all three panels. This is due to relatively small difference between the calculations of N part for Glauber and GGCF models in this centrality interval. The shape of the distribution indicates more abundant particle production in the proton-going direction in comparison to the Pb-going. This can be explained by the higher energy of the proton compared to the energy of a single nucleon in the lead nucleus in the laboratory system. In the most central collisions (0-1 %), shown with diamond markers in all three panels, this trend is reversed. Conversely, the magnitude of dN ch /d\u03b7 per participant pair strongly depends on the geometric model used to calculate N part . The point at which the central and peripheral scaled distributions cross each other also depends on the choice of geometric model. Figure 12 shows the dN ch /d\u03b7 distribution per participant pair as a function of N part for the three different models of the collisions geometry. Since the chargedparticle yields have significant pseudorapidity dependence, dN ch /d\u03b7/( N part /2) is presented in five \u03b7 intervals including the full pseudorapidity interval, \u22122.7 < \u03b7 < 2.7. In the region 0 < \u03b7 < 1, the dN ch /d\u03b7 distribution is consistent with an empirical fit to inelastic pp data that suggest dN ch /d\u03b7 increases with centre-of-mass energy, \u221a s, as \u221d s 0.10 [16]. The dN ch /d\u03b7/( N part /2) values from the standard Glauber model are approximately constant up to N part \u2248 10 and then increase for larger N part . This trend is absent in the GGCF model with \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.11, which shows a relatively constant behaviour for the integrated yield divided by the number of participant pairs. The dN ch /d\u03b7/( N part /2) values from the GGCF model with \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.2 show a slight decrease with N part in all \u03b7 intervals.",

The N part dependence of dN ch /d\u03b7/( N part /2) is found to be sensitive to the modelling of the p + Pb collision geometry, especially in the most central collisions: while the standard Glauber modelling leads to a strong increase in the multiplicity per participant pair for collisions in the centrality range (0-30) % the GGCF model produces a much milder centrality dependence.",

Under the WN model, the E Pb T distribution for fixed N part would be obtained from a N part -fold convolution of the corresponding distribution in pp collisions. This convolution is straightforward if the E T distribution in pp collisions is described by a gamma distribution [66] gamma",

Attempts to fit the measured E Pb T distribution using pure WN-convolved gamma distributions and the Glauber N part distribution yield unphysical results for the nucleon-nucleon parameters, k 0 and \u03b8 0 , when those parameters are free parameters of the fit. In particular, k 0 is less than unity, which implies a E T distribution that increases with decreasing E T faster than e \u2212 E T /\u03b8 0 , and \u03b8 0 is unrealistically large. The resulting nucleon-nucleon E T distribution is also inconsistent with that measured in pp collisions [67]. The poor behaviour of the WN model is primarily due to the difference in shape between the Glauber N part distribution and the measured E Pb T distribution.

They are presented in Table 3 along with the ratios k 1 /k 0 for each of the geometric models. Pure WN behaviour would correspond to k 1 /k 0 = 0.5 and \u03b8 1 = 0. The results indicate substantial deviations from WN behaviour for the Glauber and GGCF \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.2 fits, while the GGCF \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.11 fit yields both a k 1 /k 0 that is close to 0.5 and a small \u03b8 1 . The success of the above-described fitting procedure in describing the measured E Pb T distributions using parameterisations of the N part dependence of the E Pb T response with only two free parameters is due to the similarity of the shapes of the P(N part ) distribution and the measured E Pb T distributions. However, the pronounced knee in the Glauber P(N part ) distribution requires more non-linearity in the N part dependence of the E Pb T response. In contrast, the lack of such a feature in the GGCF P(N part ) distributions allows a simpler description of the measured E Pb T distribution. The results of the fit procedure described above provide a data-driven estimate of the total p + Pb event-selection efficiency. For the default Pythia8-based results, the integral of the simulated E Pb T distribution is 2 % higher than that in the data. The deficit in the data is concentrated at low E Pb T values, consistent with losses due to event selection. However, a detailed analysis of the residual differences between the best fit and measured distributions indicates an excess of very low E Pb T events in the data, which varies from \u223c0 % for the Glauber fit to 1.8 % for the GGCF fit with \u03c9 \u03c3 = 0.2. These may arise from residual diffractive or photo-nuclear collisions and are considered background. For the purpose of defining E Pb T centrality intervals, this background effectively increases the event-selection efficiency by adding events that are all in the 90-100 % centrality interval. For Pythia6, the E Pb T fits using the default model yield a total efficiency of 97 % and up to 1 % background. The alternative models for k N part and \u03b8 N part yield a similar total efficiency of 98 % and a background rate as high as 2 %, a rate that is compatible with independent estimates of the rate for collisions involving diffractive excitation of the proton to pass the applied event selections. Based on these results, the total effective efficiency including background is then taken to be 98 % and the uncertainty is conservatively estimated to be 2 %.",
