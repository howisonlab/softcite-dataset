The experiment is unique in its capability to observe \u03bd \u03c4 appearance on an event-by-event basis. Nuclear emulsion films instrumenting the target allow the detection of the short-lived \u03c4 lepton decay, and hence the identification of \u03bd \u03c4 Charged Current (CC) interactions. The standard three-neutrino oscillation framework predicts \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations with close-to-maximal mixing at the so-called atmospheric scale, \u2206m 2 32 \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 [2], i.e. in the oscillation parameters region discovered by detecting atmospheric neutrinos [3]. OPERA has observed four \u03bd \u03c4 CC interaction candidate events [4][5][6][7], consistent with the expectation of the standard oscillation framework at this scale. This result represents the first direct evidence of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillation in appearance mode.",

This kind of detector is historically called Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC). The OPERA detector is made of two identical Super Modules, each consisting of a target section and a muon magnetic spectrometer. Each target section has a mass of about 625 tons and is made of \u223c75000 units called bricks. A target brick consists of 56 lead plates 1mm-thick interleaved with 57 nuclear emulsion films 300 \u00b5m-thick for a mass of 8.3 kg. Its total thickness along the beam direction corresponds to about 10 radiation lengths. The bricks are assembled in vertical walls instrumented with scintillator strips (Target Tracker detectors, TT) to trigger the read-out and locate neutrino interactions within the target. OPERA was exposed to the CNGS \u03bd \u00b5 beam generated by protons from the SPS accelerator at CERN [17,18]. The contaminations of \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e and \u03bd e CC interactions at LNGS, relative to \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions, are 2.1%, 0.9% and less than 0.1%, respectively. The contamination of prompt \u03bd \u03c4 is negligible. The average \u03bd \u00b5 energy is 17 GeV. The energy spectra of the four beam components at the detector site are shown in figure 1 [19].",

The likelihood has been profiled also on the \u2206m 2 31 value. More details on the analysis are available in [34]. In figure 4 the 90% CL exclusion plot is reported in the \u2206m 2 41 vs sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5\u03c4 parameter space. The most stringent limits of direct searches for \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations at short-baselines obtained by the NOMAD [14] and CHORUS [15] experiments are also shown. Our analysis stretches the limits on \u2206m 2 41 down to 10 \u22122 eV 2 , extending the values explored with the \u03c4 appearance searches by about two orders of magnitude at large mixing, for sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5\u03c4 0.5. For maximal mixing, the 90% CL excluded region extends down to \u2206m 2 41 = 7.4 (5.2) \u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 for normal (inverted) hierarchy of the three standard neutrino masses, with a 10% systematic error deriving from the uncertainties on the \u03c4 detection efficiency and \u03bd \u03c4 interaction cross section.",

Since present limits on the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys do not exclude small negative values for \u2206m 2 41 , the analysis was repeated following this assumption. The exclusion plots obtained in this way are similar to those of figure 4, but with hierarchies exchanged. It is worth underlining that the results obtained in the 3+1 model, shown in figures 2 and 3, are independent of the sign of \u2206m 2 41 , as is the probability in equation (42). Assuming CP conservation, that implies sin \u03c6 \u00b5\u03c4 = 0, and neglecting terms in sin 2 \u2206 31 in equation (4.1), of the order of 10 \u22122 at CNGS energies E CN GS , the oscillation probability at high values of \u2206m 2 41 approximates to that of a two-flavour model parametrised in terms of two effective mixing parameters, \u03b8 eff and \u2206m In this framework, with 4 observed events and 2.53 \u00b1 0.46 events expected from the normal hierarchy of standard oscillations, including background, the upper limit on the number of additional \u03bd \u03c4 events, evaluated in the Feldman-Cousins approach [35], is 6.4 at 90% CL.
