            "text": "We present a summary of a recent workshop held at Duke University on Partonic Transverse Momentum in Hadrons: Quark Spin-Orbit Correlations and Quark-Gluon Interactions. The transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs), parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions, and multi-parton correlation functions, were discussed extensively at the Duke workshop. In this paper, we summarize first the theoretical issues concerning the study of partonic structure of hadrons at a future electron-ion collider (EIC) with emphasis on the TMDs. We then present simulation results on experimental studies of TMDs through measurements of single spin asymmetries (SSA) from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) processes with an EIC, and discuss the requirement of the detector for SIDIS measurements. The dynamics of parton correlations in the nucleon is further explored via a study of SSA in D (D) production at large transverse momenta with the aim of accessing the unexplored tri-gluon correlation functions. The workshop participants identified the SSA measurements in SIDIS as a golden program to study TMDs in both the sea and valence quark regions and to study the role of gluons, with the Sivers asymmetry measurements as examples. Such measurements will lead to major advancement in our understanding of TMDs in the valence quark region, and more importantly also allow for the investigation of TMDs in the unexplored sea quark region along with a study of their evolution.",

QCD as a theory of the strong interaction has been well-tested by observables with a large momentum transfer in high energy experiments. Our knowledge on the universal parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs), which connect the partonic dynamics to the observed hadrons, has been dramatically improved in recent years [1]. As a probability density to find a parton (quark or gluon) inside a hadron with the parton carrying the hadron's longitudinal momentum fraction x, the PDFs have provided us with the nontrivial and quantitative information about the partonic structure of a hadron.",

            "text": "In recent years, the hadronic physics community has extended its investigation of partonic structure of hadrons beyond the PDFs by exploring the parton's motion and its spatial distribution in the direction perpendicular to the parent hadron's momentum. Such effort is closely connected to the study and extraction of two new types of parton distributions: the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9], and the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [8,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. The ultimate knowledge of finding a single parton inside a hadron -involving both momentum and space information -could be encoded in the phase-space distributions of quantum mechanics, such as the Wigner quasi-probability distribution W (k, b), whose integration over the parton spatial dependence (b) leads to the TMDs, while its integration over transverse momentum (k) provides the parton's spatial distribution that is relevant to the GPDs. A quantum field theory version of the phasespace distributions, in terms of the matrix element of the Wigner operator, was discussed in Ref. [17]. Understanding both the momentum and spatial distribution of a parton inside a hadron in terms of the more general Wigner distributions could be the central object of future studies on partonic structure. Knowledge of TMDs is also crucial for understanding some novel phenomena in high energy hadronic scattering processes, such as, the single transverse spin asymmetries [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] and small-x saturation phenomena [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32].",

            "text": "Like the PDFs, the TMDs and GPDs carry rich information on hadron's partonic structure, while they are not direct physical observables due to the color confinement of QCD dynamics. It is the leading power QCD collinear factorization theorem [33] that connects the PDFs to the hadronic cross sections with large momentum transfers: Q's \u226b \u039b QCD . In order to study the TMDs, we need the corresponding TMD factorization theorem for physical observables that are sensitive to parton's transverse motion and the TMDs. Such observables often involve two very different momentum scales: Q 1 \u226b Q 2 > \u223c \u039b QCD , where the large Q 1 is necessary to ensure any perturbative QCD calculation while the small scale Q 2 is needed so that these observables are sensitive to the parton's transverse motion. The transverse momentum distribution of single hadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic leptonhadron scattering (SIDIS) and Drell-Yan lepton pair production in hadronic collisions are two natural examples. The TMD factorization for these two processes have been carefully examined [34][35][36]. However, the TMD factorization in QCD is much more restrictive than the leading power collinear factorization. The conventional TMD factorization works for three-types of observables with only two identified hadrons: single hadron p T distribution in SIDIS, the p T distribution of Drell-Yan type process, and two-hadron momentum imbalance in e + e \u2212 collisions. But it has been shown to fail for observables with more than two identified hadrons [37][38][39][40][41].",

            "text": "Important aspects of the TMD parton distributions, such as the gauge invariance, the role of gauge links, and the universality, have been explored in recent years [20][21][22][23][24][42][43][44]. Like the PDFs, the definition of TMDs is closely connected to the factorization of physical cross sections, and it is necessary for the TMDs to include all leading power longdistance contributions to the physical cross sections if they could be factorized. All leading power collinear gluon interactions are summed into the gauge links in the definition of the TMDs. It is the gauge link that makes the TMDs gauge invariant and provides the necessary phase for generating a sizable single transverse spin asymmetry (SSA) in SIDIS and Drell-Yan processes [18][19][20][21][22][23]. However, unlike the PDFs, which are universal, the TMDs could be process dependent due to the fact that the initial-state and final-state collinear gluon interactions are summed into two different gauge links. That is, the TMDs extracted from SIDIS could be different from those extracted from Drell-Yan processes because of the difference in gauge links. Although the TMDs are not in general universal, it could be shown from the parity and time-reversal invariance of QCD dynamics that the process dependence of the spin-averaged as well as spin-dependent TMDs is only a sign, which was referred to as the parity and time-reversal modified universality [20,24]. An important example of the modified universality is that the Sivers function extracted from the SIDIS measurements is At leading twist there are eight TMD quark distributions [9]: three of them, the unpolarized, the helicity and the transversity distributions, survive in the collinear limit, while the other five vanish in such a limit. Each TMD quark distribution explores one unique feature of the quark inside a polarized or unpolarized nucleon. For example, the Sivers function [3,45] provides the number density of unpolarized partons inside a transversely polarized proton, while the Boer-Mulders function [6] gives the number density of transversely polarized quarks inside an unpolarized proton. Although we have gained a lot of information on the collinear PDFs and helicity distributions, we know very little about quark's and gluon's intrinsic transverse motion inside a nucleon. Recent measurements of multiplicities and double spin asymmetries as a function of the final transverse momentum of pions in SIDIS at JLab [46,47] suggest that transverse momentum distributions may depend on the polarization of quarks and possibly also on their flavor. Calculations of transverse momentum dependence of TMDs in different models [48][49][50][51] and on lattice [52,53] indicate that dependence of transverse momentum distributions on the quark polarization and flavor may be very significant.",

However, in the case of positive hadrons, where a signal has been seen, the measurements of HERMES [58] and COM-PASS [59] experiments are only marginally compatible: the asymmetries measured by COM-PASS are somewhat smaller, and seem to indicate an unexpected dependence on W , the mass of the hadronic final state. For the transversity distribution, there is only one phenomenological extraction by combining the SIDIS and the e + e \u2212 data [60][61][62], and information on the rest of the TMDs is rather scarce. Nevertheless, these recent results have already generated great excitement, which is evident from the increasingly active theoretical activities, including modeling and lattice QCD calculations, and planning of future experiments.",

Among three types of processes where the TMD factorization could be valid, the SIDIS might be the best place to study the TMD parton distributions because of the easy separation of various TMDs with well-determined distributions in the azimuthal angles between the spin, the leptonic plane and the hadronic plane, in addition to the much higher event rates. With a broad energy range and a high luminosity, the future EIC will be an ideal place to extract the TMDs in a multi-dimensional phase space with a high precision. Precise measurements of these new distributions could provide us much needed information on the partonic structure of nucleon (nucleus) in order to address the fundamental questions concerning the decomposition of the nucleon spin, and the QCD dynamics responsible for the structure of the nucleon.",

For a quark to fragment into a spinless hadron, such as a pion, there are only two possible fragmentation functions at the leading twist: the unpolarized fragmentation function and the Collins function [64], which is responsible for generating azimuthal asymmetric distribution of hadrons from the hadronization of a transversely polarized quark. The Collins function has been extracted from recent experiments (Belle [65], HERMES [66,67], and COMPASS [68]), and was found to be nonzero.

Although the leading power term dominates the contribution to the cross sections, it does not contribute to the SSA, which is proportional to the difference of two cross sections with the spin vector reversed. Like the TMD factorization approach, the SSA in the collinear factorization approach is also generated by the active parton's transverse motion, but, as a net effect after integrating over all possible values of transverse momentum. Within the collinear factorization approach, the SSA is effectively generated by the quantum interference of two scattering amplitudes: a real amplitude with one active parton and an imaginary part of an amplitude with an active two-parton composite state [69][70][71][72][73][74]. The QCD quantum interference between the amplitude to find a single active parton and that to find a two-parton composite state is represented by a set of new twist-3 three-parton correlation functions.",

Heavy flavor production in the DIS regime is a direct probe of gluon content of the colliding hadron or the nucleus. In particular, the SSAs of open-flavor (anti)D (or B) meson production in the DIS regime provides a unique opportunity to measure trigluon correlation functions [92], which are closely connected to the gluon's transverse motion and color coherence inside a transversely polarized nucleon. A more recent study shows that there are four tri-gluon correlation functions [93]. The co-existence of these different trigluon correlation functions, which represent the long-distance quantum interference between a gluon state and a two-gluon composite state, is a unique feature of the non-Abelian color interaction. Motivated by recent calculations [92], preliminary simulations of the event rate and asymmetries for some realistic EIC energies and possible detector coverage have been carried out, which will be presented in the later section of this paper.",

In order to get a better picture of the proton's partonic structure from the limited information extracted from the PDFs, the TMDs, and the GPDs, model calculations of these distributions are valuable. There have been many interesting model studies recently, see for example [50,90,[94][95][96][97]. These models and their calculations could play a very important role as a first step to describe the experimental observations, to give an intuitive way to connect the physical observables to the partonic dynamics, and to provide key inputs to the partonic structure of the nucleon, which will help us to address the fundamental questions, such as how the quark spin and its orbital angular momentum contribute to the nucleon spin?",

In practice, a Gaussian transverse momentum distribution has been used to fit the existing experimental data in order to extract the TMDs. At low collision energy, there is not much phase space for the gluon shower around the hard collision, the active parton's intrinsic p T distribution dominates, and therefore, a Gaussian distribution should be a good ap-proximation. However, with a much higher collision energy at an EIC machine and a larger phase space for the gluon shower, the Gaussian distribution will not be adequate to describe the observed p T distribution in SIDIS. Instead, a distribution with a proper resummation of large logarithmic contributions from the gluon shower should be used [104][105][106]. When p T is as large as the hard scale Q, a perturbative calculated p T should be more relevant [105,106].

In particular, it was found that di-hadron/dijet correlation in DIS processes in eA collisions can be used to probe the Weizacker-Williams gluon distribution formulated in the color-glass-condensate formalism [108,109]. However, more theoretical studies are needed to build a rigorous connection between the TMD and CGC approaches. We believe that the TMD community as it addresses the above and other important questions will naturally make the case for an EIC stronger and will be ready for the new era of QCD and hadron structure. In the next section, we will present simulations that have been carried out with a goal of addressing the aforementioned questions with a high luminosity electron-ion collider.",

Since there is no free high-energy, high-intensity neutron beam available, one has to use the light ion beam instead. A deuteron beam is a natural choice. In the polarized case, the 3 He ion has a unique advantage as the effective polarized neutron beam; the ground state of 3 He is dominated by the S-state, where the two protons are arranged with spin anti-parallel to each other. Therefore, the 3 He spin is dominated by the neutron spin. However, the phase space of the ion is not the same as that of the proton. Given a fixed accelerator configuration, momentum per nucleon in an ion is proportional to Z/A, in which Z is the atomic number, and A is the mass number. Therefore, the light ion beam would lead to a smaller s with the same accelerator configuration. Fig. 6 illustrates different mapping of these three ion beams (accelerator:",

The workshop participants identified the SSA measurements in SIDIS as a golden program to study TMDs in both the sea and valence quark regions as well as to study the role of gluons, with the Sivers asymmetry measurements as examples. A high-intensity EIC with a wide center-of-mass energy range will allow for studies of TMDs in multi-dimensional phase space with high precisions in both the valence quark region at high Q 2 and the unexplored sea quark region, and allow for studies of tri-gluon correlation functions. Such studies will greatly advance our knowledge about the structure of the nucleon in three dimensions and transverse spin physics. ",
