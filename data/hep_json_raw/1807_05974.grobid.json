The data have been recorded by the CMS Collaboration in protonproton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . The absolute cross sections show slightly different jet transverse momentum spectra in data and Monte Carlo event generators for the settings used. Removing this transverse momentum dependence, the normalized cross section for ungroomed jets is consistent with the prediction from Monte Carlo event generators for masses below 30% of the transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed jets is measured with higher precision than the ungroomed cross section. Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading logarithmic accuracy are compared to data, as well as predictions at leading order and next-to-leading order, which include parton showering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section, the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30% of the jet transverse momentum.",

Jets are involved in nearly every final state in proton-proton (pp) collisions. In the past, most predictions of jet properties did not focus on the jet mass m, defined as the mass of the sum of the four-momenta of the constituents inside the jet. However, the jet mass is the simplest observable that is nonzero only beyond leading order (LO) in perturbation theory for dijet production. Thus, it is more sensitive to the internal structure and evolution of jets than the jet transverse momentum p T . The evolution of jets is theoretically described by parton showering as reviewed in refs. [1,2]. Experimental measurements of the jet mass provide an important test of these theoretical concepts.",

            "text": "The jet mass generated by QCD arises from the radiation of gluons from the higherenergy (hard) portion of the jet. The probability that a gluon is radiated increases as its energy or angle of emission decreases (soft or collinear radiation, respectively). Hence, the probability of having m = 0 vanishes since many soft and/or collinear gluons will be radiated. Above m/p T \u2248 0.1, there is an overall decrease in the jet mass spectrum as the dominant contributions come from gluon emissions with high energy or at large angles. The distribution terminates around m/p T \u2248 0.3 for jets with R = 0.8 (where R is the distance parameter of the algorithm). At that point, the jets become wide enough to start JHEP11(2018)113 splitting into two separate jets (the splitting threshold). The appearance of a large peak at low mass is described in ref. [6] as a \"Sudakov peak\". The jet mass is sensitive to soft QCD effects and to additional pp interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup) [7]. There is further sensitivity in hadron colliders to correlations among soft gluon emissions from underlying event interactions, and wide-angle emissions among different jets. While the impacts on global event-wide observables (such as the event thrust) have been understood for some time [8][9][10][11], the impact on nonglobal jet observables, such as mass, are difficult to calculate. The technical difficulty arises from the treatment of nonglobal logarithms (NGLs) in the perturbative next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) order calculations of the jet mass that arise from radiation that exits the jet re-radiating soft gluons back into the jet. It is currently unknown how to fully account for these NGLs in the perturbative integrals.",

            "text": "The hard part of the jet can be separated from the soft parts using jet-grooming techniques [3][4][5]. These techniques also reduce the effects of pileup, which is not correlated with the hard part of the jet. The earliest grooming techniques were unable to completely remove the soft parts of a jet systematically. More recently, major improvements have been made to separate the hard and soft parts of the jet without contamination from NGLs [6,8,[12][13][14][15]. The \"mass drop\" (MD) procedure [16] has been modified into such a theoretically controlled jet-grooming algorithm [6]. Its generalization, the \"soft drop\" (SD) algorithm [12], has similar properties. By applying the SD algorithm, soft parts of a jet are removed, resulting in a dramatically reduced Sudakov peak in the jet mass distribution. This also systematically removes the effects that cause NGLs in the calculation, allowing for direct comparisons of the semi-analytical NLL resummation calculations (in particular, from the authors of refs. [17] and [18]) to Monte Carlo (MC) simulated predictions and data. We therefore apply the SD procedure to groom the jets in this paper. A similar analysis has been published by the ATLAS Collaboration in ref. [19]. Understanding the behavior of the jet mass and the grooming techniques from first principles is important to further develop boosted object identification algorithms, to gain confidence in the tools should they uncover BSM physics, and to check that parton showering algorithms are correct.",

Finally, the powheg 2.0 [26][27][28][29] generator interfaced with pythia8 is used as a next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative dijet event generator, supplemented with parton showering and multiparton interactions.

Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each split in the barrel and two endcap sections. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and 0.087 radians in azimuth (\u03c6). In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5\u00d75 ECAL crystal arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Electron momenta are estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. In this analysis, the jet rapidity (y) is used in the computation of jet quantities. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [33].",

If any declustering step does not satisfy the soft-drop condition, the softer constituent is removed from consideration by the jet algorithm. We choose \u03b2 = 0, z cut = 0.1 and hence R 0 is no longer a relevant parameter. For this choice of parameters, the SD algorithm is identical to the variant of the MD algorithm described in ref. [6]. The choice of \u03b2 = 0 was made for simplicity to agree with most other CMS analyses, whereas other values of \u03b2 will be addressed in future work. The measurement is not very sensitive to the value of z cut , and is chosen to be consistent with ref. [6] and other CMS analyses. For the reconstructed jets, all PF candidates that survive the CHS procedure are included. The same reconstruction criteria are also used to create generator-level jets using generated stable particles (mean path length c\u03c4 > 1 cm, no minimum p T requirement), removing neutrinos. Simulated pileup particles are not included in the generator-level jets. The ungroomed jet mass is taken as the mass of the four-momentum sum of the constituents of the AK8 jet without grooming applied. The groomed jet mass is taken as the mass of the four-momentum sum of the constituents of the AK8 jet with the SD algorithm applied. For this measurement, the p T of the ungroomed AK8 jet is used for both the groomed and ungroomed jet cross sections, since it has been shown that the groomed jet p T is not collinear-safe for the SD algorithm chosen [18].",

In these figures, finite-size effects of the jet can be observed at the highest masses in the lowest p T bin. The JMS and JMR are accounted for directly in a detector response parameterization along with corrections to the MC simulation as to match data. The latter are derived using the approach outlined in ref. [43], except we use the SD algorithm to groom the jets, which is based on a fit of the jet mass from hadronically decaying W bosons in tt events where one W boson decays hadronically and the other decays leptonically (the \"lepton plus jets\" channel). The ratio of the fitted means in data and in MC simulation is the correction to the JMS, and the ratio of the fitted widths is the correction to the JMR. This estimate assumes that detector-related uncertainties will be the same for jets from W boson decays and jets initiated by quarks and gluons. The remaining differences are effects from the physics model, and are thus accounted for with our physics model uncertainty. The JMR and JMS corrections in the 2015 run of the LHC (\"Run 2\") are measured to be 1.07 \u00b1 0.12 and 0.98 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, using the methods of ref. [43].

The data were collected with single-jet triggers of varying p T thresholds as in the inclusive jet analysis from ref. [45]. As in that paper, the ensemble of events is constructed such that any given trigger only contributes to a specific p T region, where it is fully efficient. However, since we are using a different R-parameter for the jet clustering algorithm (we use R = 0.8 as opposed to R = 0.4 and 0.7), our thresholds, shown in table 1, are slightly different than those from the inclusive jet analysis [45]. The same p T thresholds are used for both 50 and 25 ns data. In the collisions with 50 ns bunch spacing, the trigger prescales were -6 -JHEP11 2018 lower, and thus this dataset increases the number of events collected for p T < 460 GeV by 10% compared to the 25 ns run alone, where the prescales are considerably higher.

The choice of jet mass bins is a trade-off among the approximate detector resolution of \u223c10 GeV [42], the purity (the fraction of events in a reconstructed bin that are generated in the same bin), and the stability (the fraction of events in a generated bin that are reconstructed in the same bin). The lower bin boundaries are 10,20,40,60,80,100 GeV and then increase by 50 GeV beyond 100 GeV. The same binning is used for both the reconstructed and generated jet mass.

The grooming algorithm is observed to decrease the jet mass overall, and reduce the sensitivity of the observable to details of the physics modeling and pileup effects. The data are compared to various theoretical predictions, including new calculations using analytical resummation. Overall, in the normalized cross section, the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30% of the jet transverse momentum.",
