Oscillation experiments have proven that at least one of the neutrino mass states has m i > 0.05 eV while various interpretations of cosmological observations yielded an upper limit for the sum of neutrino masses \u2211m i < (0.14 -1.7) eV. The searches for the yet unobserved 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay result in an effective neutrino mass m \u03b2\u03b2 < (0.2 -0.7) eV. The analyses of measured tritium \u03b2-spectra provide an upper limit for the effective electron neutrino mass m(v e ) < 2 eV. In this review, we summarize the experience of two generations of \u03b2-ray spectroscopists who improved the upper limit of m(v e ) by three orders of magnitude. We describe important steps in the development of radioactive sources and electron spectrometers, and recapitulate the lessons from now-disproved claims for the neutrino mass of 30 eV and the 17 keV neutrino with an admixture larger than 0.03%. We also pay attention to new experimental approaches and searches for hypothetical sterile neutrinos.",

            "text": "\u03b2-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool of neutrino physics. An unexpected shape of measured \u03b2-spectra led Pauli to the concept of a new fundamental particle, the neutrino (in addition to the then known electron and proton), saving the law of energy conservation in nuclear \u03b2-decay [1]. The Fermi theory of \u03b2-decay, incorporating the Pauli neutrino and assuming a new type of particle interaction (the weak interaction), predicted the \u03b2-spectrum shape that agreed with the experiment [2]. This was a strong, though indirect, argument for the existence of the neutrino. Later on, three kinds (or flavors) of neutrinos were discovered, the electron neutrino v e [3], the muon neutrino v \u00b5 [4] and the tau neutrino v \u03c4 [5]. Of course, properties of v \u00b5 and v \u03c4 cannot be examined by \u03b2-spectroscopy since the \u03b2-decay energies are not sufficient to create charged \u03bc or \u03c4 leptons born together with these neutrinos in the weak interactions.",

            "text": "When neutrino oscillation became a real possibility, Shrock [6] pointed out that the individual neutrino mass eigenstates should manifest themselves as irregularities (kinks) in the otherwise continuous \u03b2-spectra. This warning initiated numerous searches for an admixture of heavier neutrinos with masses m i between 10 2 and 10 5 eV, as allowed by the available \u03b2-decay energies [7]. However, up to now, \u03b2-spectroscopists have not found any kinks in their \u03b2spectra that would correspond to those individual neutrino mass states. The upper limits for the admixture of heavier neutrinos are below 1% in most cases. It follows from oscillation experiments that the mass differences of the three oscillating active neutrinos are too small to be resolved by the present \u03b2-spectrometers. Nevertheless, these instruments established that the effective mass of the electron neutrino is smaller than 2 eV [8]. There are indications from a few neutrino oscillation experiments and cosmological observations that, in addition to the active neutrinos v e , v \u00b5 and v \u03c4 , there could exist sterile neutrinos [9 -11]. As we describe in Section 3.7.2, the upcoming \u03b2-spectrometers could provide useful information about these hypothetical particles in the eV mass range and maybe also in the keV mass range.",

The authors argue that it would be possible to disentangle various mechanisms that may contribute to the neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay if this decay were examined in a sufficient number of isotopes. However, other investigators [43] recommend a more cautious interpretation of the experimental data of T 1/2 0v\u03b2\u03b2 . According [44], the matrix elements from present calculations differ from one to another by up a factor of three. In addition to the possibility of experimental determination of the effective neutrino mass m \u03b2\u03b2 according to Eq. (2), the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay seems to be the only known way to examine a possible violation of the law of lepton number conservation. Long-standing searches for this extremely rare process are described [45,46]. Requirements for current and future 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments are discussed in [47,48], while new expectations and uncertainties in 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay are reviewed [49] in the light of recent neutrino oscillation studies as well as cosmological observations. The latest results of the double beta decay searches along with the expected sensitivities of experiments in construction are reviewed [50 -52].",

The often quoted estimate < 0.6 eV is considered to be a conservative one. On the other hand, Beutler et al.

The results of neutrino oscillation experiments enable not only the examination of the dependence of various neutrino quantities on the minimal neutrino mass m min as shown in Fig. (1) but also the exploration the-relationship of these quantities. Newer graphical comparisons of m v e , m \u03b2 \u03b2 , and are depicted in Figs. (3 and 4).  and < m \u03b2 > = m ve defined in Eq. 5. The blue horizontallyhatched band corresponds to NH, the slant red one to IH. The width of these bands reflects the uncertainty due to the unknown phases \u03c6(k) in Eq. 2. Wider bands restricted by solid lines (in red for NH and in black for IH) include the experimental uncertainties of the oscillation parameters. The systematic uncertainties of the nuclear matrix elements are not included. This figure is reproduced from [41]. Fig. (3) shows that the strongest cosmological constraint on total neutrino mass, < 0.14 eV at the 95% CL [69], corresponds to the following limits on both m v e and m \u03b2\u03b2 of < 0.04 eV for NH and < 0.06 eV for IH. According to [41] and Fig. (4), the neutrino oscillation data indicate a lower limit of m \u03b2\u03b2 for IH but no such limit for NH. The overlap of bands for NH and IH demonstrates that future 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments could examine the neutrino mass ordering only if their sensitivity is better than 0.01 eV. In addition, the oscillation data allow the testing of whether the observed values of m \u03b2\u03b2 and are in agreement with the assumptions of the 3-neutrino framework and the dominance of the light neutrino ",

In addition, the spectrometer must exhibit a high luminosity 7 and low background in order not to miss a weak effect at the upper end of the \u03b2-spectrum. Simultaneous fulfillment of these requirements was not yet achieved to the required level, despite more than half a century's effort. Thus all the measurements of the \u03b2-spectra up to now have yielded only an upper limit on m v. Fig. (5).

Explicitly When the technique of \u03b2-ray spectroscopy was significantly improved by Bergkvist in 1972 [83], it became necessary to consider that a part of the \u03b2-decay energy may be spent for an excitation of the daughter ion. In this case the observed \u03b2-spectrum would be described as a superposition of partial \u03b2-spectra with endpoint energies E 0j = E 0 -m v -V j , where V j is the energy of the j-th excitation state populated with the probability P j : (10) 6 The mathematical description of various theoretical correction terms is summarized in [82]. 7 High luminosity L = \u03a9/4\u03c0 \u2022 S, where \u03a9/4\u03c0 is the fractional input solid angle and S is the source area, is indispensable. The sources must be extremely thin to avoid deterioration of measured spectra by losses of electron energy within the source material. ",

The \u03b2-decay of a gaseous tritium molecules (T 2 ) is more complicated. Nevertheless, reliable calculations for the molecular ion ( 3 HeT) + are available that take into account both electronic and rotational-vibrational molecular states, see Fig. (6). These predictions have not yet been experimentally verified but their precision and internal consistency indicates their applicability in the newest neutrino mass measurements. On the other hand, calculations V j and P j for \u03b2-decay of atoms in many-electron systems of complex molecules or for \u03b2-emitters imbedded into solids may also suffer from insufficient knowledge of the composition of the radioactive samples. Very recently, a detailed assessment of molecular effects on the determination of m v e from tritium \u03b2-spectra has become available [85]. results from the calculations of excitation to the electronic bound states [87] and to the electronic continuum [88] of ( 3 HeT) + . The electronic ground state is populated in 57% of the decays, 29% of the decays end in the excited electronic states and remaining 14% lead to the electronic continuum.

The mean energy of these excitations is 1.7 eV with the energy spread (FWHM) of about 0.4 eV.

When fitting only the uppermost part of the \u03b2-spectrum, the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the spectrometer does not introduce a recognizable systematic error in the determination of m v e [89]. The use of a fixed value of E 0 , derived from precision measurement of the atomic masses of 3 H and 3 He, would greatly facilitate the task, since the m ve 2 and E 0 variables are strongly correlated. However, in this case the precision of both E 0 and the absolute energy calibration of the \u03b2-ray spectrometer have to reach a level of a few-meV [90], far from the present state of the art. Still, the comparison of fitted and independently measured E 0 values proves to be an important check of the correctness of the evaluation of the \u03b2-spectrum. The newest measurement of the cyclotron frequency ratios of 3 He + to HD + and T + to HD + in the Penning ion trap have yielded a Q value for tritium \u03b2decay equal to 18 592.01 \u00b1 0.07 eV [91], which will enable a sensitive test of the fitted value of E 0 . Fig. (7). The uppermost part of the tritium \u03b2 spectrum, wide only 7 meV, was calculated for the normal hierarchy of the neutrino mass states (m 1 < m 2 < m 3 ) assuming the endpoint energy E 0 = 18.575 keV and m 1 = 200 meV.

(5) equals 200.57 meV. We have assumed for simplicity that all the 3 H \u2192 3 He + e -+ \u035e \u03bd e decays proceed to the ground state of the daughter ion. Fig. (8).

The sources were prepared by thermal evaporation in vacuum of tritiated succinic acid (HOOC\u2022CH 2 CH 2 \u2022COOH) with specific activity of 33 MBq \u03bcg -1 (i.e. about 10% of protium atoms were substituted by tritium ones). This compound was quite stable at room temperature and sublimated at 150\u00b0C thus avoiding any thermal damage of a 4 \u03bcg cm -2 thick organic support during evaporation. Autoradiography revealed a complete uniformity of the invisible deposit with an estimated surface density of about 0.5 \u03bcg cm -2 . Two methods were applied to prevent electrostatic charging of the source. First, a 2 \u03bcg cm -2 thick and 1 cm-wide copper band was evaporated onto the reverse side of the insulating organic support. The band resistivity of 10 8 \u03a9 was sufficient to insure good grounding. Second, an 9 Tritium has the second smallest endpoint energy of all known \u03b2-emitters. The super-allowed character of its \u03b2-decay leads to an acceptable half-life of 12.3 y. In suitable chemical forms, the simple electronic structure of tritium facilitates interpretation of the measured \u03b2-spectra. These are reasons why tritium was utilized in the majority of subsequent searches of m v . 187 Re with the lowest E 0 of 2.5 keV could not be examined via the usual \u03b2spectroscopic methods due to its half-life of 4.3 \u2022 10 10 y. However, the low-temperature micro calorimeters offer an interesting possibility for its investigation, see Sect. 3.5. oxide-coated cathode filament was installed just below the source where electrons emitted from the heated filament would neutralize any positive charge created on the source due to the emission of \u03b2-particles. Both methods applied separately or together yielded the same endpoint energy E, while the one using an ungrounded source was lower by 460 eV due to the positive charging of the source. The analyses of measured \u03b2-spectra yielded an upper limit m ve <250 eV [98].",

The overall experimental resolution, including energy losses within the tritium source, was estimated to be \u0394E exp = 55 eV at 18.6 keV. In spite of numerous slits in the spectrometer chamber, scattered \u03b2-particles produced about half of a high and energy dependent background above E 0 (see Fig. 10).

The endpoint region of the tritium \u03b2-spectrum measured with the extended source in the Bergkvist experiment [83]. The quantity on the x-coordinate is proportional to the \u03b2-particle momentum. The spectrum above E 0 was checked for slight curvature by recording the background in the range 480 -510 \u03a9.

The width of the overall resolution function, utilized in the analysis of measured tritium \u03b2-spectrum, thus increased to 70 eV.

A special anticoincidence proportional counter enabled the reduction of the background without the source inside the spectrometer to about 0.03 s -1 for energies below 20 keV, regardless of the relatively large size of the detector. Fig. (11). An iron-free magnetic \u03b2-ray spectrometer with radial focusing and axial defocusing at the curved exit slit [108]. This focusing principle offers better combination of resolution and transmission than conventional \u03c0 \u221a2 spectrometers at the price of a larger detector and focusing angle of (\u03c0/2)\u2022\u221a13 = 324.5\u00b0. The radius of a central orbit is 30 cm. Note the coils compensating external magnetic fields in three perpendicular directions. In order to increase the luminosity of their instrument the authors used a technique of an extended source [103]. Instead of a set of narrow strips at different potentials they applied an electrostatic correction by a continuous potential drop. For this purpose the 10 \u03bcg cm -2 nitrocellulose backing of the radioactive layer was covered by 6 \u03bcg cm -2 silver layer with a resistance of 10 9 \u03a9 between the adjacent potential defining wires with 1.2 mm spacing. A thin tritium film, prepared by spreading out a solution of tritiated polystyrene in benzene on water, was deposited on the silver side of the backing. Four tritium sources with dimensions (22 x 23) mm 2 and surface density of 4 -6 \u03bcg cm -2 were prepared in this way. Measurements of monoenergetic electrons emitted from a similarly extended 216 Po source proved that the instrumental resolution achieved with these extended sources was the same as that for an equipotential source of (0.5 \u00d7 20) mm 2 . The quality of one of the sources is demonstrated by a completely straight Kurie plot of the last 3 keV region of the \u03b2 spectrum as shown in Fig. (12).The derived endpoint energy E 0 = (18.649 \u00b1 0.074) keV agrees within 1\u03c3 with its current value and the upper limit m v e < 86 eV was determined at the 90% C. L. [106]. Fig. (12). The Kurie plot of the tritium \u03b2-spectrum measured by [106]. The 3 keV wide endpoint region is shown for a source with a thickness of the active layer of (4.5 \u00b1 1.5) \u03bcg cm -2 . Quality of the fit is demonstrated by a spectrum of residuals in the upper part of the figure.",

This arrangement enabled the analysis of electrons emitted in the angular intervals of \u00b17.5\u00b0 and twice 120\u00b0 with respect to the source normal. To increase the dispersion of the device, electrons were led through the analyzing field four times, turning their direction by 180\u00b0 in each path. This magnetic deflection by 720\u00b0 also almost eliminated background caused by scattered electrons. In measurements of tritium \u03b2-spectra, Tretyakov et al.

The composed source consisted of 18 parts, each of the size (2.6 \u00d7 18) mm 2 . The parts were arranged in 9 pairs emitting electrons in opposite directions, thus enabling more efficient use of the spectrometer azimuthal angle.",

The detector of 80 mm 2 area and 5 mm thickness had resolution of 215 eV at 5.9 keV. A diffuse beam of tritium ions of energy between 8 and 9.1 MeV penetrated through 25 \u03bcm thick Be window into 0.2 mm of Si(Li) crystal. This penetration depth far exceeded the 2.5 \u03bcm range of the 18.6 keV \u03b2-particles and 14 \u03bcm range of 1.7 keV Si x-rays. During implantation the detector was kept at liquid-nitrogen temperature. The detector resolution deteriorated at the end of implantation but returned to its original value after annealing. The atomic density of implanted tritium was estimated to be about 1.5\u202210 13 cm -3 . A chopper emitting 8.05 and 17.48 keV K \u03b11 -X rays of Cu and Mo respectively, was installed in front of the Si(Li) detector to enable energy calibration and stabilization during long tritium \u03b2-spectra runs. The chopper wheel with two slots allowing penetration of x-rays to the detector rotated with a period of a few seconds. In this way, two spectra were recorded with the same electronics setting almost simultaneously: a spectrum of \u03b2-rays plus x-rays and the other of \u03b2-rays only. The measured tritium \u03b2-spectra did not reveal any deviations from the theoretical shape expected for zero neutrino mass and the upper limit of m v e < 65 eV was derived with 95% confidence.",

[122] utilized the same chemical compound for the 3  A major improvement in precision \u03b2-ray spectroscopy was achieved by Robertson et al. [110] at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who applied a gaseous source with circulating molecular tritium. The main advantage was that the theoretical spectrum of final states of the (T 3 He) + molecular ion is known more reliably than that of complex solid sources. Additionally, the energy losses of \u03b2-particles within tritium gas could be determined more precisely than in the case of solid sources. A solenoidal magnetic field guided to the spectrometer only those \u03b2-particles that did not backscatter on inner walls of the source vessel. Since no separation window was allowed between the source and the spectrometer, a steady flow of tritium into the source was needed, followed by an intensive differential pumping to avoid spectrometer contamination. No increase of background due to escaped tritium was observed and the background rate of ~0.005 s -1 was caused mainly by cosmic rays. A toroidal magnetic spectrometer of the Tretyakov type [109] with focal length of 5 m, was adjusted to a fixed energy above the tritium endpoint and variable negative bias voltages were applied to the source tube to scan the spectra. Electrons were detected by an array of Si micro strip detectors, allowing the recording of 12 spectra simultaneously. Observed counting rates were renormalized for pressure variations in the source, the activity of which was monitored with another Si detector. Instrumental resolution was measured by circulating gaseous 83m Kr through the source and examining the shape of the K-conversion line with 17.8 keV. The natural width of this line, as well as shake-up and shake-off satellites, were carefully taken into account. The authors [110] also quantified 10 various contributions of uncertainties in the neutrino mass determination. Fig. (15).

The instrument combines a retarding electrostatic field with a guiding inhomogeneous magnetic field (the so called MAC-E Filter). Contrary to common differential spectrometers, the resolution function of this device has no high-energy tail, a great advantage in the search for a signature of massive neutrino in the uppermost part of \u03b2-spectrum. Weinheimer et al. [128] employed the Mainz MAC-E-Filter to measure \u03b2-spectrum of molecular T 2 frozen on an aluminum substrate cooled down to 2.8 K.

Mass spectrometry revealed about 30% of protium contamination, probably originating from previous storage of tritium in a stainless steel container. There was a substantial escape of tritium from the source with an effective half-life of one weak. Therefore the data were taken for about ten days per source. The electrons were detected with a segmented silicon detector with a resolution of 2.0 keV FWHM at 20 keV energy. Data were stored event-byevent, allowing the checking of the distribution of time differences between successive events. Observed sudden increases in the count rate, probably triggered by microsparks in the spectrometer, were rejected. The remaining data were in accord with the statistics. An observable \u03b2-spectrum already emerged clearly from the background at 20 eV below the endpoint but the deduced m ve 2 shifted to increasingly more negative values with widening fit interval. The experimental results disproving the ITEP claim [117] are summarized in Table. 2. To facilitate the comparison we present the upper limits calculated according to the unified approach [130] with quantities constrained to be nonnegative. Undoubtedly, the case of the 30 eV-neutrino considerably improved \u03b2-spectroscopic methods aiming at the neutrino mass determination. In the words of the Nobel prize-winner V. L. Ginsburg, \"Sometimes science is better served by a wrong result if it is published than withheld\" [124]. ",

            "text": "The best model-independent upper limits of the effective neutrino mass m v e , as defined by Eq. (5), originate from two measurements of the tritium \u03b2-spectrum using electrostatic spectrometers of the MAC-E-Filter type. Kraus et al. [38] improved the Mainz setup in the following way in comparison with its previous stage [128]. The shock-condensed, amorphous T 2 films were cooled to 1.8 K, which substantially slowed down the surface migration, leading to small crystals of size exceeding the average thickness of the T 2 layer. Unaccounted energy loss in these crystals formed at temperatures of 3-4 K was the main reason for previous negative values of m v e 2 [128]. The source area and thickness were increased to 2 cm 2 and about 140 monolayers (~50 nm). Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with low electron backscattering and atomic flat surface over wide terraces served as a source backing. A LHe-cooled chicane with inner carbon coating adsorbed traces of T 2 that escaped from the source. In this way, the source-dependent component of the detector background was eliminated. Electropolishing the spectrometer tank and its electrodes not only reduced outgassing and field emission but also removed tritium contamination from previous runs. The spectrometer was backed up to 330-420\u00b0C and conditioned up to \u00b1 30 kV to further improve conditions of the experiment. Using this improved setup, 11 measurement series were carried out during five years. The following are examples of the effects considered in the \u03b2-spectra analysis: a continuously growing coverage of the source by 0.3 monolayers of H 2 per day; a T 2 loss of 0.17 monolayers/day obviously caused by the recoiling daughter molecules that each sputtered a few neighboring molecules from the source, and a self-charging of the T 2 film that reached about 2.5 V at the outer surface. Final states of the daughter molecule calculated by Saenz et al. [131] for gaseous T 2 were slightly modified for a solid T 2 and complemented with a prompt excitation of neighbors next to a decaying T 2 molecule. This effect (amounting to a surprisingly large value of ~5% of all decays) is due to local relaxation of the lattice following the sudden appearance of a (T Aseev et al. [39] re-analyzed all data acquired by the Troitsk experiment in which the MAC-E Filter with the resolution of 3.7 eV (FW) at 18.6 keV was utilized to analyze \u03b2-particles emitted from a windowless gaseous source of molecular tritium (WGTS), similar to that of [110]. Details of the apparatus are described in [132]. The authors succeeded in suppressing the partial pressure of tritium in the spectrometer (of which the decay would cause an undesirable background) to about 10 -18 mbar. Superconducting solenoids provided a maximum magnetic field of 5 T, while the minimum field in the spectrometer analyzing plane was 1 mT. Electrons were detected with a Si(Li) detector with sensitive area of 2.3 cm 2 . Due to the point-by-point character of the measurement, the intensity of the WGTS was checked every 15 minutes at the monitor point of \u03b2-spectrum at 18.0 keV where the counting rate was high. The hydrogen-isotope concentration in the WGTS was measured every two hours but nevertheless the main systematic error arose from an uncertainty of the tritium column density in the WGTS. Only runs with reliable experimental conditions were included in the re-analysis of \u03b2-spectra acquired during the 1994-2004 period. The former anomaly -a step-like structure of 5-15 eV below the endpoint with roughly 6 months period and an amplitude of ~6 From these two independent experiments it is possible to calculate their weighted average, -0.64 \u00b1 1.95 eV 2 , which according to [130] gives the current upper limit of m v e < 1.6 eV at 90% CL.",

The successor, the international collaboration KATRIN (the Karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment) [40] was founded in 2001 with the aim of increasing the sensitivity to m v e by one order of magnitude up to 0.2 eV. In order to reach this improvement (increase by two orders of magnitude with respect to the experimental observable m v e 2 ) the collaboration developed an extremely large MAC-E-Filter of 23 m length and 10 m diameter to analyze the endpoint region of the tritium \u03b2-spectrum. A WGTS [133] held at 30 K with a stability better than 30 mK [134] will provide 10 11 \u03b2-particles per second. The necessary amount of chemically and isotopically purified tritium will be supplied by a unique tritium laboratory which is a part of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The tritium purity will be monitored by laser Raman spectroscopy [135]. A system of superconducting magnets will guide \u03b2-particles in a magnetic flux tube of 190 Tcm 2 into a prespectrometer (a smaller MAC-E-Filter of moderate resolution). This instrument [136] will cut off the prevailing part of \u03b2-spectrum, not bearing any information about the neutrino mass. The remaining uppermost part will be analyzed by the main spectrometer with a resolution of 0.93 eV (FW). A strong differential and cryogenic pumping will ensure that the tritium pressure inside the spectrometer will be 14 orders of magnitude smaller than that in the middle of the WGTS. A system of wire electrodes with a more negative potential than the main spectrometer vessel will not allow secondary electrons produced by cosmic muons to penetrate into the spectrometer volume and increase background. Electrons will be detected by an array of 148-pixel Si PIN detectors [137]. A high voltage in the region of 18 kV will be measured with the help of a precision voltage divider [138]. In addition, the stability of the high-voltage will be continuously checked by the monitor spectrometer (reconstructed Mainz MAC-E-Filter) using conversion electrons from a solid 83 Rb/ 83m Kr source with energy stability of 0.3 ppm/month [139]. The challenge of controlling the electrostatic potentials in this experiment has been discussed [140].",

It was derived from the inner bremsstrahlung spectrum emitted by the 4p and 5p atomic electrons during the 163 Ho decay. The measurements were carried out with a 30 rise time of about 1 ms. The R&D in this field was recently supported by a new project HOLMES [152] that plans to deploy a 1000-channel multiplexed array of temperature edge sensors coupled to Au absorbers. Each of the absorbers will be implanted with 6.5 \u202210 13 holmium nuclei yielding 300 decays of 163 Ho per second. The detectors should exhibit energy resolution of ~1 eV and resolution time of ~1 \u03bcs. The plan is to collect 3\u202210 13 decay events during 3 years of measuring time. The aim of the HOLMES experiment is to reach a m \u03bd sensitivity of 0.4 eV and explore a possibility to enhance it to 0.1 eV.",

Robertson [153] pointed out that the theoretical spectrum is not yet sufficiently understood to allow an eV-scale determination of the neutrino mass from a measured 163 Ho spectrum. The reason is a complicated structure of energetically allowed final states of the dysprosium atom after the decay. Very recently Faessler performed detailed calculations of the process using the relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock electron wave functions and concluded that the two-hole [154] and three-hole [155] excitations do not complicate the determination of the neutrino mass compared to the situation with one-hole states only.

This method differs principally from the previous ones based either on an analysis of electron movement in magnetic and/or electric fields or on calorimetric measurement of energy released by electrons and photons in a \u03b2-decay. The proposed method takes advantage of an extraordinary precision of frequency measurements. Contrary to taking the energy spectra point-by-point as usual, but similarly to calorimetric measurements, all frequencies are recorded simultaneously. Therefore, precautions have to be taken against the pile-up effect that would otherwise spoil the measured \u03b2-ray spectra. The systematic errors occurring in the frequency measurements differ substantially from those in previous techniques, which is an advantage in the effort to achieve a reliable neutrino mass determination.",

This would avoid a rotational-vibrational broadening of 0.36 eV that accompanies the \u03b2-decay of molecular tritium. The source temperature, now limited to 30 K in T 2 , could be lowered to 1 K thus reducing the Doppler-shift broadening. Preliminary results of the potential sensitivity of this novel method are exhibited in Fig. (21). While attractive, they should be regarded as the best estimate that could be reached with this approach [161]. The final goal of Project 8 is to reach a sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass m v e (Eq. 5) as low as 0.05 eV. If this experiment were to reliably prove that m v e is less than this limit, it would imply that the hierarchy of neutrino mass states is normal one, i.e. m 1 < m 2 < m 3 . Fig. (21). The neutrino mass sensitivity expected in the Project 8 measurement using cyclotron radiation of single electrons emitted in tritium \u03b2-decay [161]. The dependence on the effective volume of gaseous sources of molecular or atomic tritium is shown for indicated number densities per cm 3 . A source temperature will be 30 K for molecular T 2 and 1 K for atomic tritium. Using conversion electrons emitted by 83m Kr in a gaseous state, the Project 8 collaboration recently proved that cyclotron radiation can detect and measure the energy of a single electron [162]. It is interesting to see in Fig. (2)  [162] repeated cycles of a continuous decrease of the electron kinetic energy by emission of cyclotron radiation followed by a sudden jump caused by a collision with residual gas.",

This novel kinematic (and thus model-independent) approach requires a tuning of an ion beam that causes most of \u03b2-particles to move forward with respect to the beam while those from the endpoint region of the \u03b2-spectrum move backwards. If the ratio of backward to forward moving electrons could be determined with sufficient precision the proposed method would yield information on m v e . The idea is to store a beam of \u03b2-radioactive ions with a very low boost factor (e.g. \u03b3 = 1.037 for 3 H ions) in an evacuated chamber with a weak magnetic field parallel to the beam line. A detector on the forward wall of the chamber will monitor the huge number of forward moving \u03b2-decays while another detector on the backward wall will count a small number of electrons spiraling backwards in the laboratory frame. In this way \u03b2-particles from the neutrino mass-sensitive endpoint region can be separated from the prevailing \u03b2-spectrum part. In order to reach or exceed the 0.2 eV sensitivity for m v e a \u03b2-emitter with Q = M -M'-m e of a few keV (here M and M' are the masses of the mother and daughter ions) should be identified 17 and the number of detected \u03b2-particles should be at least 10 18 . The experimental requirements are illustrated in Fig. (22). Major challenges of the proposed experiment are the separation of the forward and backward moving electrons with a precision of order 10 -16 while keeping the ion momentum spread \u03b4p I /p I in the range 10 -4 -10 -5 , and avoiding any scattering of electrons or beam ions that would increase background in the backward detector.

However, Otten argued in his comment [169] on the Jerkins proposal [168] that a factor of 10 6 is lacking in necessary counting statistics. Jerkins et al. opposed [170] that their extraordinary high sensitivity is a consequence of suitable correlation between the shape of the \u03b2-spectrum and the shape of the neutrino mass-squared peak. Otten also demonstrated that spurious electromagnetic fields, decreasing the m v e sensitivity, need to be controlled at almost an inconceivable level; the same holds for checking the stability and spatial distribution of the retarding potential [169]. It is known that hemispherical electrostatic analyzers with narrow input and output slits are capable of a high energy resolution 18 but their rather low luminosity was not considered in the Jerkins proposal, as was also reminded in [169]. A verification of this new concept for the m v e determination will have to wait for a development of sources of ultracold atomic tritium 19 as well as for Rydberg track chambers. 18 For example, the electron energy analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy measured the Xe5p 3/2 spectrum in the gas phase with the resolution better than 2.7 meV at pass energy of 2 eV [171]. 19 Even temperatures much lower than 1 \u03bcK would be desirable to decrease the dominating spread in the values of m ve 2 , see Fig. (3) in [168].

[174] explored theoretically a new type of atomic or molecular spectroscopy that could yield -at least in principle -the m i values of individual neutrino mass states and possibly determine other yet unknown neutrino properties. The basic idea is to prepare a collection of excited atoms or molecules in a metastable state |e> and then induce their cooperative and coherent deexcitation to a ground state |g>. The authors plan to measure spectra of low energy photons \u03b3 in the extremely rare process |e> \u2192 |g> + \u03b3 + \u03bd i \u03bd j where \u03bd i and \u03bd j (with i, j = 1, 2, 3) denote the neutrino mass states. The process, called radiative emission of a neutrino pair (RENP) is a combination of second-order quantum electrodynamics (proceeding via virtual intermediate atomic or molecular states) and weak interaction. The released energy, about 8 eV in a Xe atom [172], about 2 eV in a Yb atom [173] and about 0.8 eV in an I 2 molecule [174], is much closer to the expected neutrino masses than in a nuclear \u03b2-decay. If the number density of coherently deexciting atoms or molecules will approach the Avogadro number per cm 3 , the yet unobserved RENP rate may become measurable. Then in the continuous photon spectrum six threshold locations should appear at   As shown in Figs. (25 and 26). is the energy difference between the initial and final state. As a first step, Fukumi et al. [172] plan to prove the macro-coherence in the twin process |e> \u2192 |g> + \u03b3 + \u03b3. The RENP free of quantum electromagnetic backgrounds was treated theoretically in [175]. Calculations [176] proved that a possible existence of one additional mass state of the light sterile neutrino (discussed in Sect. 3.7) would not decrease the sensitivity of the RENP method to active neutrinos.",

These so far hypothetical neutrinos would not have any ordinary weak interactions except those induced by mixing. Those alternatives are often referred to as the 3+1 and 3+2 scenarios.

On the other hand, the Planck collaboration that measures the temperature anisotropy of the CMB [66], analyzed their data in combination with other cosmological surveys and found no clear indications for sterile neutrinos and derived < 0.23 eV [181]. An et al. [182] searched for a light sterile neutrino using data of the Daya Bay experiment on oscillation of reactor neutrinos. The measured data are in accord with the concept of three active neutrinos and lead to upper limits for |U 14 | 2 in the region of  [183]. Boyarsky et al. examined hypothetical keV sterile neutrinos as a possible component of the dark matter. He derived from astroparticle observations that an admixture of sterile neutrinos to the active ones should be less than 10 -7 [184]. Leistedt et al. found that the concept of sterile neutrinos did not improve the concordance among various cosmological observations [185].

He emphasized that an admixture of each of such states would produce a discontinuity in the \u03b2- spectrum slope similar to those shown in Fig. (7). From the position and amplitude of the ith kink the values of m i and |U ei | 2 entering Eq. 5, could be determined. In principle, the signature of a specific mass state m i should be observable in the spectrum of every \u03b2-emitter with the endpoint energy E 0 at kinetic energy equal to E 0 -m i . Shrock analyzed the experimental Kurie plots of a large number of \u03b2-decays. Taking into account that Kurie plots often deviate from linearity due to energy losses of low energy \u03b2-particles, he found a possible admixture |U ei | 2 \u2264 0.1 for 0.1 keV \u2264 m i \u2264 3",

The 64 Cu activity of 3.3 \u202210 11 Bq was produced by (n, \u03b3) reaction in a thermal neutron flux of 3\u202210 14 cm -2 s -1 . A target of an area of (5 \u00d7 10) cm 2 and surface density of 500 \u03bcg cm -2 was prepared by vacuum evaporation of 98% -enriched 63 Cu onto an Al backing. The \u03b2 + and \u03b2 spectra in the energy range 150-680 keV and 75-600 keV respectively were measured with a double-focusing magnetic spectrometer [187] equipped with a 32-wire proportional counter. The overall resolution of the set-up, including effects of the target thickness, was determined to be 1 keV at 300 keV using internal conversion lines in the reaction 63 Cu (n, e -). Analysis of the \u03b2 + and \u03b2 spectra taken from the same source with the same instrument increased reliability of the analysis since the signature of a sterile neutrino with mass m 4 should appear in \u03b2 + spectrum as well as \u03b2 spectrum at energies E 0\u03b2 + -m 4 and E 0\u03b2--m 4 , respectively. An upper limit for the admixture of a neutrino state with a mass between 110 and 450 keV was determined to be 0.8% at the 90% CL.",

Some of the subsequent measurements with semiconductor spectrometers, examining \u03b2-spectra of 3 H, 14 C, 35 S and 63 Ni, were consistent with about 1% admixture of the 17 keV neutrino, see e.g. Fig. (27).

[194] examined a \u03b2-spectrum of 35 S (Q \u03b2 = 167.2 keV, T 1/2 = 87.5 d) with an apparatus consisting of a superconducting solenoid that collected \u03b2-particles from the source to a high-resolution Si(Li) spectrometer. This arrangement exhibited an input solid angle of 50% of 4\u03c0 and thus weak sources (typically less than 4 kBq) of better spectroscopic quality could be employed. The mixing probability of the 17 keV neutrino was determined to be -0.0004 \u00b1 0.0008 stat \u00b1 0.0008 syst , in disagreement with several previous experiments using solid-state detectors.

Fitting the \u03b2-spectrum of the composite ( 35 S + 14 C) source with a pure 35 S spectrum shape led to the reduced \u03c7 2 value of 3.5 while fitting with a free combination of the 35 S and 14 C \u03b2-spectra yielded reduced \u03c7 2 value of 1.06.

The spectra of residuals of the composite \u03b2spectrum fit are shown in Fig. (29). Further investigation of the 35 S \u03b2-spectrum [195] clarified that the 17 keV neutrino claim, reported in previous studies of this isotope [192,196] originated mostly from an improper treatment of the electron energy losses in the source itself. Still another exploration of 35 S \u03b2-spectrum revealed that a thin metallic diaphragm in front a Si(Li) detector can generate a false 17 keV neutrino admixture of 0.3% [197]. Although now disproved, the claim for the 17 keV neutrino (in a similar manner to the 30 eV claim discussed in Sect. 3.3) pushed forward the development of precision \u03b2-ray spectroscopy. The relevant experiments with both positive and negative results are listed [198,199]. Their detailed account can be found [200,201]. \"The rise and fall of the 17 keV neutrino\" was also briefly described [202].",

The K-shell vacancies were created by the impact of \u03b2-particles from the sources on atoms in the contamination layer. The observed line intensity is in good agreement with the prediction based on the cross-section for electron-impact ionization amounting (10 4 -10 5 ) \u202210 -24 cm 2 for the \u03b2-particles of given energy [213] and activity of the sources (6.5 MBq for 241 Pu and 1 MBq for 63 Ni). If the spectra were recorded at a worse instrumental resolution, the Auger lines would smear out and one could erroneously interpret the observed deviation as an anomaly in the \u03b2-spectrum shape. Fig. (31). The KLL-Auger lines of carbon and oxygen superimposed on continuous \u03b2-spectra of 241 Pu and 63 Ni [214]. The spectra of the vacuum-evaporated sources were recorded with an electrostatic spectrometer [210,215] by scanning the shown energy regions 10 000 and 18 000 times 22 . The measurement time was 1 s per point in every scan. Fig. (32) Recently, Troitsk physicists extended the analysis of tritium \u03b2-spectra gathered in their search for the effective mass m v e of light active neutrinos [39] and using the maximum-likelihood method they looked for any signatures of sterile neutrinos. A possible admixture of the neutrino mass state with 20 \u2264 m 4 \u2264 100 eV was found to be less than 1% at the 95% CL [217,218]. The surprising feature of their analysis is that this upper limit did not depend on systematic uncertainties of their experiment. This was not the case in their analysis of the same \u03b2-spectra for m v e where statistical and systematic uncertainties played about the same role [39]. Even a new analysis of tritium \u03b2-spectra of the Mainz neutrino mass experiment [38], involving detailed examination of systematic uncertainties, did not reveal any admixture of the fourth neutrino mass state [219]. 22 Compatibility of parts of \u03b2-spectra collected during various time intervals can be tested e.g. by sensitive statistical tests [216].",

The authors [220] estimated that KATRIN after three years of data-taking should be able to place the limits sin 2 (2\u03b8 4 ) \u2264 0.08 and 0.20 for |\u0394m 41 2 | > 4 and 2 eV 2 , respectively. The two values of sin 2 (2\u03b8 4 ) correspond to |U e4 | 2 = 0.02 and 0.05. Similar results were obtained [224] with the conclusion that, for mixing angles sin 2 (2\u03b8 4 ) \u2264 0.1, the KATRIN experiment could provide the most stringent limit on the active-sterile mass square difference |\u0394m 41 2 |.",

Their Monte-Carlo-generated tritium \u03b2-spectra included the sterile mass states m 4 and m 5 up to 6.4 eV and mixings |U e4 | 2 and |U e4 | 2 in the interval from 5.5\u202210 -4 to 0.18. Projected parameters of the KATRIN setup, including an energy resolution of 0.93 eV, a background of 0.01s -1 and systematic uncertainty of 0.017 eV 2 [142], were assumed. Possible future improvements such as a higher \u03b2-spectrum amplitude, better resolution and lower background were probed as well. The authors concluded that the KATRIN experiment should be sensitive enough to confirm or disprove sterile neutrinos with \u0394m 41 2 = 6.49 eV 2 , |U e4 | 2 = 0.12 and |U e5 | 2 = 0.11, as suggested by some cosmologists. In the 2 \u00d7 2 mixing scheme (one active light neutrino with the effective mass m v e according to Eq. 5 and one sterile neutrino), any of the mass states m 4 with |U e4 | 2 \u2265 0.055 should be detected with 3\u03c3 confidence. The same sensitivity is expected for any of the mixing angles for the mass state with m 4 \u2265 3.2 eV.",

            "text": "Barret [220]. Later, the reported reactor anomaly of 2.5 \u03c3 in the short baseline neutrino oscillations [221] was weakened to 1.4 \u03c3 when the recently measured value of the mixing angle \u03b8 13 was taken into account [222]; the former ratio of observed to predicted neutrino flux of 0.943 \u00b1 0.023 was thus reduced to 0.959 \u00b1 0.009 (experimental uncertainty) \u00b1 0.027 (flux systematics). Garvey et al. [223] took into account that up to 30% of \u03b2-decays of all fission products may be of the first forbidden type whose properties are not adequately known. This fact modifies the energy spectrum of antineutrinos emitted by nuclear reactor. From the authors' analysis it follows that the uncertainty on the neutrino flux should be expanded beyond 4%. The authors [227] estimated quantitatively the influence of eight different uncertainties of the shape of the theoretical \u03b2spectrum, such as decay into excited final states, nuclear correction terms, etc, and concluded that these uncertainties decrease the sensitivity to keV neutrinos by about one order of magnitude. Ensuring the relative standard deviation of individual points of the overall \u03b2-spectrum on the level of 10 -6 during 3 measurement years is an extremely challenging task. Therefore the authors considered an alternative approach where the keV sterile neutrinos would be searched in a \u03b2spectrum with the same tritium source as in the KATRIN experiment but with a high-resolution detector. Their simulations showed that the wavelet transform, i.e. the convolution of the \u03b2-spectrum with specific window functions, is largely insensitive to smooth spectral deformations that are caused e.g. by slow changes of the measurement conditions. A statistical sensitivity to sterile-to-active neutrino mixing |U e4 | 2 = 10 -6 is expected for the detector resolution of FWHM \u2248 100 eV. Nevertheless, the most reliable way to correct experimental results is a sufficiently precise knowledge of all systematic effects. Such approach may require a series of side measurements as exemplified by the Mainz neutrino mass experiment [38].",

            "text": "It has been a hundred years since James Chadwick convincingly proved that the energy spectrum of \u03b2-rays is continuous 25 . This surprising finding, together with an unexpected spin of several nuclei like N, initiated a novel concept of the neutrino by Wolfgang Pauli [1] and of the weak interactions by Enrico Fermi [2]. In 1948 \u03b2-ray spectroscopy provided the first upper limit of the neutrino rest mass [92]. The next two generations of \u03b2-ray spectroscopists succeeded in improving this limit by three orders of magnitude to the present value of the effective electron neutrino mass m v e \u2264 2 eV [8]. While the oscillation experiments provide the differences m i 2 -m j 2 with increasing precision, the values of m i remain unknown. The upcoming KATRIN experiment with its projected sensitivity of 200 meV [40] should explore an almost full quasi-degenerate region of neutrino masses, see Fig. (1). It is hoped that new \u03b2spectroscopic approaches, including those listed in this review, will lead to an even higher sensitivity. 24 According to ref. [232] these sterile neutrinos could not only be warm but also cold dark matter. 25 It was achieved by means of a magnetic spectrometer equipped with a Geiger counter. Former recording of electron intensity with photographic plates enabled rather precise measurement of the energy of monoenergetic internal conversion electrons but due to nonlinearity of the plate blackening did not allow reliable investigation of \u03b2-rays.",

From current values of the squared mass differences \u0394m 21 2 = (7.53 \u00b1 0.18) \u202210 for IH [8], it is possible to derive a lower limit on two of the mass eigenvalues.
