PICO-60 is the largest bubble chamber to search for dark matter to date. With an analyzed exposure of 92.8 live-days, PICO-60 exhibits the same excellent background rejection observed in smaller bubble chambers. Alpha decays in PICO-60 exhibit frequency-dependent acoustic calorimetry, similar but not identical to that reported recently in a C3F8 bubble chamber. PICO-60 also observes a large population of unknown background events, exhibiting acoustic, spatial, and timing behaviors inconsistent with those expected from a dark matter signal. These behaviors allow for analysis cuts to remove all background events while retaining 48.2% of the exposure. Stringent limits on WIMPs interacting via spin-dependent proton and spin-independent processes are set, and most interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal as dark matter interacting with iodine nuclei are ruled out.",

Direct detection dark matter experiments are sensitive to the nuclear recoils resulting from collisions between WIMPs and ordinary matter. The main challenge in the field has been to scale up detector target masses while eliminating or rejecting backgrounds to a potential dark matter signal [6].",

To allow for transient behaviors to subside, dark matter data begins accumulating only after the chamber is stable at the target pressure for 25 seconds. Differences in live images from one frame to the next provide the primary trigger, initiating compression. Optical and acoustic data surrounding the trigger time are logged, as well as the pressure and temperature record over the entire expansion. The compression is accomplished by reapplying compressed air to the piston, raising the hydraulic pressure to \u223c200 psia within 250 ms. Triggers are also generated by the hydraulic controller in response to pressure spikes, and by the data acquisition system if no trigger is received after a \"timeout\" time of between 500 and 2000 seconds. The timeout time was increased twice during the run to increase the live fraction.

A total exposure of 155.1 live days was collected over the course of the run.

The pressure and temperature of the active fluid determine the conditions for radiation-induced bubble nucleation. The Seitz \"hot spike\" model [18] calculates the enthalpy necessary to produce a critically-sized bubble, and assumes that the full energy deposited by a particle interaction is used to form a bubble. The critically-sized bubble is defined by Gibbs as a bubble in which the pressure differential across the surface is balanced by the surface tension [19]:",

Previous neutron calibration data using both broad spectrum AmBe sources and low energy, monoenergetic YBe sources have shown that the Seitz model is not an accurate picture of bubble nucleation in CF 3 I, particularly for carbon and fluorine recoils [10,21,22]. A recent analysis of all available neutron data shows that carbon and fluorine recoils in CF 3 I do not efficiently produce bubbles until their energies are significantly above the calculated Seitz threshold [23]. Simulations of carbon and fluorine tracks in CF 3 I using the Stopping Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) package [24] provide an explanation for the observed inefficiency -carbon and fluorine tracks are comparable in size to, and often larger than, the critical bubble size. Iodine recoils produce much shorter tracks, and bubble chamber data taken with a pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility show that the iodine response is much closer to the nominal Seitz model [25].",

The carbon and fluorine responses are constrained primarily by the neutron data, while the iodine response is constrained by the pion beam data of [25]. As in [14], the efficiency curves are fit by monotonically increasing, piecewise linear functions, with the constraints that no nucleation occurs below E T , and that P I (E) \u2265 P F (E) \u2265 P C (E). The solid lines in Figure  4 show the best fit iodine, fluorine, and carbon efficiency curves at 13.6 keV. Note that the onset of efficiency for fluorine and carbon recoils occurs at energies higher than twice the calculated Seitz threshold. The allowed shapes are well-constrained by the data, particularly for iodine because of the quality of the data in [25]. To give a sense of the uncertainties, the worst case efficiency curves for each element allowed by the global fit at 1\u03c3 are shifted to the right by about 10% on average relative to the solid curves of Fig. 4 (and only 5% for the onset of iodine efficiency). We note, however, that one cannot simultaneously achieve the worst case shapes for all three elements and still be consistent with calibration data.",

PICO-60 data were taken at a continuum of Seitz thresholds between 7 and 20 keV, however, with E T calculated individually for each expansion based on the temperature and pressure for that expansion. We therefore must translate the derived efficiency curves at 13.6 keV to the other operating conditions of the experiment. Previous calibrations in superheated droplet detectors parameterized the efficiency response for recoils in C 4 F 10 as an explicit function of E/E T [26], finding good agreement with neutron calibration data above 7 keV. As iodine recoils follow the Seitz model rather closely, scaling the curve shown in Fig. 4 using E/E T is a natural way to translate the iodine response at 13.6 to the other operating conditions. One might be hesitant to apply the same scaling to carbon and fluorine recoils given their strong deviation from the nominal Seitz model. However, fits of the YBe and AmBe neutron calibration data of [23] between 7 and 40 keV for carbon and fluorine recoils are consistent with a single derived efficiency shape that also scales with E/E T , and we therefore apply that scaling to translate the efficiency curves of Fig. 4 for all three recoil species on an expansion by expansion basis to determine our sensitivity to dark matter.",

Before installation, all detector components in proximity to the active volume were screened for radioactivity, and the results from this screening are incorporated into a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the detector. Neutron production rates and energy spectra for (\u03b1,n) reactions are evaluated with a modified version of the SOURCES-4c code [23,27], where the contributions to neutron backgrounds primarily come from alpha decays in the 238 U, 232 Th and 235 U decay chains. The rate and angular distribution of cosmogenic neutrons produced in the cavern rock are taken from [28] and normalized to the muon flux measured by the SNO experiment [29]. The neutrons are propagated through the detector using GEANT4 [30] (version 4.10.00p03) to the target fluid. The predicted number of neutroninduced single bubble events during the WIMP search data is 1.0 \u00b1 0.3. The simulation returns the same number of multiple bubble events as single bubble events, and the predicted number of neutron-induced multiple bubble events is also 1.0 \u00b1 0.3. The uncertainty on the prediction arises from a combination of screening uncertainties, (\u03b1,n) cross section uncertainties, and imperfect knowledge of the material composition of some components. The leading source of events is cosmogenic neutrons produced in the rock and punching through the water shield, accounting for about 1/3 of the neutron backgrounds. The remainder come primarily from a com- bination of (\u03b1,n) sources in acoustic sensor cabling, a set of thermocouples in the pressure vessel, and the retroreflector used for illumination.",

Given the half-lives of the various decays in the chain, 90% of the first and second alpha decays are separated by less than 10 minutes, and 90% of the second and third alpha decays are separated by less than 130 minutes. Eighty-two triplets of consecutive alpha events consistent with this time structure are identified in the dataset. Each triplet is required to be isolated in time with respect to other alpha events in order to increase the purity of the sample of events assigned to each decay. With this dataset we find that the acoustic power and its frequency spectrum is dependent on alpha energy. AP low and AP high do not provide sufficient frequency resolution to capture this dependence, so the AP is calculated separately in bins of size 1-3 kHz between 2 kHz and 115 kHz.

Below 40 kHz the charac- ter of the relationship between alpha energy and acoustic energy is less straightforward. For example, near 20 kHz the lower energy 222 Rn and 218 Po decays produce larger acoustic responses (by more than a factor of 2) than the higher energy 214 Po decay. The same result is found for CF 3 I in the small 2 liter chamber. In contrast, the C 3 F 8 data from [14] shows no indication of similar behavior below 40 kHz in C 3 F 8 , remaining monotonic in alpha energy (see Fig. 8). We have not observed any similar dependence of acoustic response on the energy of neutron induced nuclear recoils.

The rate of these events decreases with increasing threshold, but they appear for all temperatures and pressures. Due to the large number of background events and the ability to cleanly distinguish them from alphas using AP low , the characteristics of these events can be studied in detail. The events have several characteristics that differentiate them from a dark matter signal.",

II). Also shown are the alpha events (the high AP peak in Fig. 5). A WIMP signal would have no preference as to when in an expansion it appeared, and would therefore appear flat. On the other hand, the background events exhibit very strong timing correlations, preferentially occurring at short expansion times. Although a small fraction of alpha decays do have timing correlations relevant on these scales (the 218 Po decays), the total alpha distribution is nearly flat in expansion time and can be viewed as a proxy for a dark matter signal.",

The AP acceptance uncertainty depends on the quality of the calibration data, especially as the acoustic conditions vary with time and expansion pressure. In previous analyses, the acoustic cut was set far from the median of the AP distribution [10,14], but this analysis requires an acoustic cut set close to the median, rendering the result more susceptible to drifts in the normalization. The largest systematic comes from time variations of 3% in the median of AP high , leading to an uncertainty on the cut acceptance of 12%.

Changes in acceptance as a function of pressure set point (due to changing signal to noise) were found to be subdominant. Because the final cut is close to the median of the AP high distribution in this analysis, it is not very sensitive to the width. We combine all uncertainties in quadrature to obtain a final uncertainty of 14%. The acceptance for the final AP high cut is 0.63\u00b10.09. We perform several cross checks by resampling the calibration data taken at different times, at different temperatures and pressure set points, and with different neutron source locations (producing a different spatial distribution), and the results are consistent to within the evaluated uncertainties.

The limit calculations follow the formalism laid out in [34], using the modified Maxwell-Boltzmann halo model with a smooth velocity cutoff at the Galactic escape velocity described in [35] and the following halo parameters: \u03c1 D = 0.3 GeV c \u22122 cm \u22123 , v esc = 544 km/s, v 0 = 220 km/s, and v Earth = 30 km/s.

For the SI case, we use the M response of Table 1 in [36], and for SD interactions, we use the sum of the \u03a3 and \u03a3 terms from the same table. To implement these interactions and form factors, we use the publicly available dmdd code package [39,40].

One mechanism by which particulates can create bubbles is if an alpha decay from an atom embedded in a small dust particle resulted in a partial alpha track into the fluid with the daughter nucleus remaining in the particle, and such a track could provide the acoustic signature observed in the background events [26]. The timing and spatial distributions suggest convection currents as a potential source of particle movement, and particulate spike runs in a test chamber have shown that particulates do collect on the interfaces. Additionally, assays of the fluids taken after the run discovered many particulates with composition matching the wetted surfaces of the inner volume, as well as elevated levels of thorium in the chamber. A future run of PICO-60 with C 3 F 8 will include upgrades to allow for improved cleaning of the glass and metal surfaces before filling, and active filtration of the fluids.",

Most dark matter halo models require any observed modulation amplitude to be a fraction of the total dark matter signal, leading to a larger total rate of dark matter interactions. However, the smallest possible dark matter cross section compatible with the DAMA/LIBRA observation is obtained by assuming that the modulation signal encompasses the entire dark matter rate. The KIMS Collaboration has published an upper limit on dark matter interactions with iodine (in CsI crystals) of 0.0098 counts/kg/keV/day [61], leaving some room for an iodine interpretation for DAMA/LIBRA given the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the two experiments. Given the use of CF 3 I as the target material and its size, the PICO-60 data presented here provide a stronger test of the hypothesis that DAMA/LIBRA is observing dark matter scattering from iodine nuclei.",

We then apply the quenching factor for iodine used by DAMA (0.09) to convert the observed energy in DAMA/LIBRA to an iodine-equivalent recoil energy of 22 to 67 keV. The modulation spectrum is convolved with the PICO-60 iodine recoil nucleation efficiency model and WIMP search exposure, taking into account the calendar time of the PICO-60 run. If DAMA/LIBRA were seeing dark matter interactions with iodine, we calculate that PICO-60 would have observed 49 events after applying the optimum cuts. The effective 90% C.L. upper limit on the number of observed events in PICO-60 after applying those cuts is 4.4 events (see the Appendix for details), more than a factor of 10 below the expectation. Because the DAMA/LIBRA modulation extends up to several tens of keV iodine-equivalent recoil energy, these results are quite robust to different models of the iodine nucleation efficiency consistent with the data in [25]. Recent measurements of quenching factors in NaI suggest that iodine has a smaller quenching factor than assumed by DAMA/LIBRA [22,62,63], which would only strengthen the limits presented here. We conclude that the signal in DAMA/LIBRA cannot be iodine recoils induced by dark matter interactions.",

By comparing the optimum cuts for the experimental and simulated datasets, we find the expected signal rate where the optimized cuts for 90% of simulated experiments with that expected signal rate have the same or worse sensitivity as the experimental data. The assumption of no background in the simulated datasets is conservative, since the inclusion of background events in the model can only reduce the number of events attributed to WIMP interactions, resulting in a more stringent upper limit on the WIMP-induced rate.",

The cuts on each of the variables are applied sequentially, and the ordering is chosen based on which of the remaining variables' distributions is the least consistent with dark matter.",

While all three KS tests return p-values of less than 10 \u221260 that the two samples under test are drawn from the same distribution, the largest KS-test statistic (corresponding to the smallest correspondence between the distributions under test) is found for AP high . We therefore impose an upper limit cut on the value of AP high , and slowly lower that cut value until the KS-test between the calibration data and the background events returns a p-value > 0.003.

We follow the same procedure, increasing the one-sided cut on expansion time until once again the KStest returns a p-value > 0.003. We repeat the process one more time on Zsurf. No cut is made on Dwall beyond the nominal fiducial cut, as the Dwall distribution is consistent with dark matter at the 3\u03c3 level. The corresponding cuts defining the restricted dataset are shown in Table I. These cuts remove all but 16 events while keeping 63.8% of the total exposure. At this stage, for a given expected signal rate, all possible sets of cut parameters are tested on the restricted dataset to find the optimum cuts, defined as the cuts that maximize the probability of observing more events passing the cuts than actually do pass the cuts. That is, the cut parameters are found that provide the highest confidence level for excluding the assumed expected signal rate as too high. The probability and confidence levels are functions of the expected signal rate, as are, in principle, the optimum cuts, although we find the same optimum cuts over the full range of expected signal rate explored. The maximum confidence level is referred to as C max . The quantity C max is also calculated for each simulated dataset with the expected signal rate applicable to that dataset. The 90 th percentile value of C max over the set of simulations for a given expected signal rate is referred to as C max . The 90% upper limit on the expected signal rate is the smallest rate for which C max of the data is greater than C max .",
