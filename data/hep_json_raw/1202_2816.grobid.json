J/\u03c8 particles are detected for p t > 0, in the rapidity interval |y| < 0.9 via decay into e + e \u2212 , and in the interval 2.5 < y < 4.0 via decay into \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pairs. An approximately linear increase of the J/\u03c8 yields normalized to their event average (dN J/\u03c8 /dy)/ dN J/\u03c8 /dy with (dN ch /d\u03b7)/ dN ch /d\u03b7 is observed in both rapidity ranges, where dN ch /d\u03b7 is measured within |\u03b7| < 1 and p t > 0. In the highest multiplicity interval with dN ch /d\u03b7(bin) = 24.1, corresponding to four times the minimum bias multiplicity density, an enhancement relative to the minimum bias J/\u03c8 yield by a factor of about 5 at 2.5 < y < 4 (8 at |y| < 0.9) is observed.",

            "text": "Understanding the production mechanism of quarkonium states in hadronic collisions is still a challenge due to its sensitivity to perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). While the primary production of heavy quarkantiquark (qq) pairs is generally treated as a hard process which can be calculated within perturbative QCD, the subsequent formation of a bound colorless qq pair is inherently non-perturbative and difficult to treat. The models developed to describe quarkonium production in high energy hadron collisions consequently follow various approaches, mainly differing in the relative contribution of the intermediate color singlet and color octet qq states [1,2]. Recent theoretical work tries to describe consistently [3][4][5] the measured production cross section and polarization, in particular in light of recent measurements at the LHC [6][7][8][9][10][11].",

            "text": "It is also important to consider that a high energy protonproton collision can have a substantial contribution from Multi-Parton Interactions (MPI) [12,13]. In this case several interactions on the parton level can occur in a single pp collision, which can introduce a dependence of particle production on the total event multiplicity [14][15][16]. If MPI were mainly affecting processes involving only light quarks and gluons, as implemented e.g. in PYTHIA 6.4, processes like J/\u03c8 and open heavy flavor production should not be influenced and their rates are expected to be independent of the overall event multiplicity. However, at the high center-of-mass energies reached at the LHC, there might be a substantial contribution of MPI on a harder scale which can also induce a correlation between the yield of quarkonia and the total charged particle multiplicity [17]. An early study that relates open \u2729 \u00a9 CERN for the benefit of the ALICE Collaboration. charm production and underlying event properties was performed by the NA27 experiment for pp collisions at \u221a s = 27 GeV, with the result that charged particle multiplicity distributions in events with open charm production have a mean that is higher by \u223c 20% than the ones without [18]. In [19,20] it has been argued that, due to the spatial distribution of partons in the transverse plane (as described in generalized parton distributions), the density of partons in pp collisions will be strongly impact parameter dependent. Therefore, the probability for MPI to occur will increase towards smaller impact parameters. This effect might be further enhanced by quantum-mechanical fluctuations of the small Bj\u00f8rken-x gluon densities.",

Therefore, it is a valid question whether pp collisions also exhibit any kind of collective behavior as seen in these heavy-ion collisions. An indication for this might be the observation of long range, near-side angular correlations (ridge) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV with charged particle multiplicities above four times the mean multiplicity [22,23]. Since quarkonium yields in heavy-ion reactions are expected to be modified relative to minimum bias pp collisions [24][25][26], one might ask whether their production rates in highmultiplicity pp collisions are already exhibiting any effect like J/\u03c8 suppression.",

It has to be in coincidence with the arrival of proton bunches from both sides of the interaction region. The efficiency of the MB trigger to record inelastic collisions was evaluated by Monte Carlo studies and is 86.4% [30]. For the di-muon analysis, a more restrictive trigger is used (\u03bc-MB). It requires the detection of at least one muon above a threshold of p trig t > 0.5 GeV/c in the muon trigger chambers in addition to the MB trigger requirement.",

In case of the di-electron analysis, the absolute differences between the resulting (dN J/\u03c8 /dy)/ dN J/\u03c8 /dy values obtained by using the likesign and the track rotation methods define the uncertainty due to the background subtraction. It is found to vary between 2% and 12% for the different multiplicity intervals. For the di-muon analysis this uncertainty is evaluated by varying the functional form of the background description (polynomial instead of sum of two exponential). It depends on the signal to background ratio and varies between 3% and 4%. Since for the muon measurement it is not possible to associate a measured track to the interaction vertex, due to the multiple scattering of the muons in the frontal absorber, an additional systematic uncertainty arises from pile-up events. Among the vertices inside these events always the one with the largest number of associated tracks is chosen as main vertex. Therefore, events with very low multiplicities are more likely to have a wrong assignment and thus this uncertainty is largest in the first multiplicity interval (6%), while it is 3% in the others. Possible changes of the p t spectra with event multiplicity can introduce a dN ch /d\u03b7 dependence of the acceptance and efficiency correction, thus resulting in an additional systematic uncertainty. This is estimated by varying the p t of the J/\u03c8 spectrum that is used as input to the determination of the corrections via simulation between 2.6 and 3.2 GeV/c. A systematic effect of 1.5% (3.5%) is found for the di-electron (di-muon) analysis. The total systematic error on (dN J/\u03c8 /dy)/ dN J/\u03c8 /dy is given by the quadratic sum of the separated contributions and amounts to 2.5-12% depending on the multiplicity interval for the di-electron result. In the case of the di-muon analysis it varies between 8% in the first and 6% in the last multiplicity interval. An additional global uncertainty of 1.5% on the normalization of dN J/\u03c8 /dy is introduced by the correction of the trigger inefficiency for all inelastic collisions.",

A J/\u03c8 cluster is a string formed by a cc pair produced via parton shower evolution which has an invariant mass that is too low for the standard Lund string fragmentation procedure and thus does not correspond to a well-defined hard scattering process. The calculation shown in Fig. 4 is thus the ratio of the multiplicity distributions generated for minimum bias events and events containing J/\u03c8 from hard scatterings. It exhibits a decrease of the J/\u03c8 multiplicity with respect to the event multiplicity, which indicates that hard J/\u03c8 production, as modeled by PYTHIA 6.4.25, is not accompanied by an increase of the total hadronic activity. Further studies with other models such as PYTHIA 8 [38] and Cascade [39] are needed. It should be pointed out that our measurement also includes J/\u03c8 from the decay of beauty hadrons, which is not part of the shown PYTHIA result. The fraction of J/\u03c8 from feed down can change with the event multiplicity and can therefore contribute to the observed multiplicity dependence.

In this scenario the multiplicity of charged particles is a direct measure-ment of the number of partonic interactions in the pp events. If the effect of MPI extends into the regime of hard processes, also the J/\u03c8 yield should scale with the number of partonic collisions and the observed correlation will result. It has even been conjectured in [40] that the increase of the J/\u03c8 yield with dN ch /d\u03b7 and the ridge phenomenon observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions [23] could be related. They might both be caused by the lateral extent of the gluon distributions, in combination with fluctuations of the gluon density. The presence of these fluctuations could significantly increase the probability for MPI and thus cause the observed rise of the J/\u03c8 yield.",

With a mean value of dN ch /d\u03b7 of 24.1, the highest multiplicity interval shown in Fig. 3, for instance, corresponds roughly to 45-50% centrality for Cu-Cu collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [21]. In order to establish whether any evidence for a J/\u03c8 suppression is observed already in pp, a proper normalization is needed. This could be provided by a measurement of open charm production in the same multiplicity bins. Corresponding studies are currently ongoing. In summary, relative J/\u03c8 yields are measured for the first time in pp collisions as a function of the charged particle multiplicity density dN ch /d\u03b7. J/\u03c8 mesons are detected at mid-rapidity (| y| < 0.9) and forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4), while dN ch /d\u03b7 is determined at mid-rapidity (|\u03b7| < 1). An approximately linear increase of the J/\u03c8 yields with the charged particle multiplicity is observed. The increase is similar at forward and mid-rapidity, exhibiting an enhancement relative to minimum bias J/\u03c8 yield by a factor of about 5 at 2.5 < y < 4 (8 at |y| < 0.9) for events with four times the minimum bias charged particle multiplicity. Our result might either indicate that J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions is always connected with a strong hadronic activity, or that multiparton interactions could also affect the harder momentum scales relevant for quarkonia production. Further studies of charged particle multiplicity dependence of J/\u03c8 , \u03a5 , and open charm production, also as a function of p t , will shed more light on the nature of the observed effect.",
