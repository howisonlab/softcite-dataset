In the SM, the charmed particle processes for which a significant non-vanishing CP violation is expected are singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) decays in which there is both interference between two different decay amplitudes and a strong phase shift from final state interactions. In the SM, CP violation in SCS charmed meson decays is predicted to occur at the level of O(0.1)% or lower [2]. The SM also predicts a CP asymmetry in the final states containing a neutral kaon that is produced via K 0 \u2212K 0 mixing even if no CP violating phase exists in the charm decay amplitudes. The expected magnitude for this type of asymmetry is (0.332 \u00b1 0.006)% from K 0 L semileptonic decay [3]. Searches for CP violation in charmed mesons are complementary to those in B and K mesons, since the former tests the CP violating couplings of the up-type quarks while the latter those of the down-type quarks.",

The choice of the three-dimensional (3-D) binning is selected in order to avoid large statistical fluctuations in each bin.

The AD + (s) F B and A \u03c0 + \u01eb components in A D + (s) \u2192K 0 S \u03c0 + recare directly obtained from the D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + sample, but there is no corresponding large statistics decay mode that can be used to directly measure the A \u2192K 0 S K + rec . Thus, to correct the reconstructed asymmetry in the K 0 S K + final states, we use samples ofD 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + as well as D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + decays. The measured asymmetry for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + is a sum of A D 0 F B , A K \u2212 \u01eb ,and A \u03c0 + \u01eb . Thus, we can extract A K \u2212 \u01eb by subtracting the measured asymmetry for D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + from that for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . An A K \u2212 \u01eb correction map is obtained as follows; N D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + rec and ND 0 \u2192K + \u03c0 \u2212 rec are corrected according to the reconstructed asymmetry for D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + in bins of (p lab \u03c0 , cos \u03b8 lab \u03c0 , cos \u03b8 CMS D ). Subsequently, corrected N D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + rec and ND 0 \u2192K + \u03c0 \u2212 rec values are determined in bins of K \u2213 momentum and polar angle in the laboratory frame, (p lab K \u2213 , cos \u03b8 lab K \u2213 ). From the corrected values of N D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + rec and ND 0 \u2192K + \u03c0 \u2212 rec in bins of (p lab K \u2213 , cos \u03b8 lab K \u2213 ), we obtain an A K \u2212 \u01eb map that is used to correct A K + \u01eb [10] for the K 0 S K + final states. By subtracting A K + \u01eb from the reconstructed asymmetry of D + (s) \u2192 K 0 S K + , we obtain the corrected reconstruction asymmetry A K + \u01eb for D + (s) \u2192 K 0 S K + :",
