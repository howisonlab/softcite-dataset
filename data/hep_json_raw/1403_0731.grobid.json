Their oscillation can be described by a 3\u00d73 unitary matrix, containing three mixing angles \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 , and one CP phase. Both \u03b8 12 and \u03b8 23 are known from previous experiments. \u03b8 13 was unknown just two years ago. The Daya Bay experiment gave the first definitive non-zero value in 2012. An improved measurement of the oscillation amplitude sin 2 2(\u03b8 13 ) = 0.090 +0.008   \u22120.009 and the first direct measurement of the\u03bde mass-squared difference |\u2206m 2 ee | = (2.59 +0.19   \u22120.20 ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 were obtained recently. The large value of \u03b8 13 boosts the next generation of reactor antineutrino experiments designed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, such as JUNO and RENO-50.",

A parameterization of the standard Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix describing the unitary transformation relating the mass and flavor eigenstates, defines the three mixing angles (\u03b8 23 , \u03b8 12 , and \u03b8 13 ) and one charge-parity(CP)-violating phase. the T2K, 6 MINOS 7 and Double Chooz experiments. 8 The value of \u03b8 13 will guide the designs of future experiments for the measurements of the mass hierarchy and CP-violation. Long-baseline accelerator experiments have limited sensitivity to the \u03b8 13 mixing angle due to dependencies on the yet unknown mass hierarchy and CP-violating phase. Reactor antineutrino experiments can provide a clear and accurate measurement of \u03b8 13 , due to their pure antineutrino source, clear signal and independence of the CP phase and matter effects. For reactor-based antineutrino experiments, \u03b8 13 can be determined in terms of the survival probability of\u03bd e at certain distances from the reactors, P (\u03bd e \u2192\u03bd e ) = 1 \u2212 cos 4 \u03b8 13 sin",

The total energy of gammas from neutron capture on Gd is about 8 MeV, which is much higher than the energy range of background radioactivity. The observable antineutrino spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.

The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant complex, one of the 5 most prolific sources of reactor neutrinos in the world, consists of 6 reactors (see Fig. 2) producing 17.4 GW of total thermal power. The goal of the experiment is to  measure \u03b8 13 with a sensitivity of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.01 at a 90% C.L. In order to achieve such high sensitivity, the experiment is optimized in several aspects. Multiple sites (one far experimental hall (EH3) and two near experimental halls (EH1,EH2)) are used to effectively cancel the flux uncertainty by relative measurements. The experiment employs 8 identically designed detectors to decrease detector related errors. As shown in Fig. 2, only 6 detectors were deployed before August. 2012. All 8 detectors were installed by October, 2012. The detectors are installed underground to reduce the cosmic-ray muon flux.

RPCs are gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes operating in streamer mode at Daya Bay. 13 RPC signals are read out by external strips, with a position resolution of about 8 cm. There are 54 modules in each near hall and 81 modules in the Far Hall. The designed efficiency is >99.5% with uncertainty less than 0.25% by combining the water Cherenkov and RPC detectors.

The mass hierarchy can be determined by a precisely energy spectrum measurement in reactor neutrino oscillations, which is independent of the CP-violating phase. Figure 9 shows the L/E distribution of reactor antineutrino oscillations. It is found that frequencies of oscillation between the normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy have some difference. The two oscillation frequency components are driven by \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 32 , respectively. 20\u221223 The difference is very sensitive to detector energy resolution. According to the study in Ref. 24, for a single detector at a baseline of 58 km and with a 35 GW reactor, the probability to determine the sign of the hierarchy has a significant difference between 3% and 4% energy resolution as shown in Fig. 10. Another big effect on mass hierarchy sensitivity is potentially from multiple reactor baselines, which are required to be within 500 m. 25 A large detector with good energy resolution (3%) and equal baselines from powerful reactor cores is required for a mass hierarchy determination.

The total thermal power of the reactors is 36 GW. The detector will be constructed deep underground to reduce the cosmic-ray muon flux, with an overburden of about 700 m of rock. The detector will be filled with 20 ktons of liquid scintillator with 3% energy resolution (at 1MeV). The major goal of JUNO is to determine the mass hierarchy by precisely  measuring the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos. However, it is a multipurpose experiment that can also measure neutrino oscillation parameters, study atmospheric, solar and geo-neutrinos, and perform other exotic searches. Figure 12 is the detector concept of JUNO. There are around 15,000 20-inch PMTs installed in the central detector for the 3% energy resolution. 6 ktons of mineral oil is used to shield the scintillator from PMT glass radioactivity. The muon veto system includes an outer water Cherenkov detector and a top tracking system. As for the physics prospects of JUNO, 25 if we take into account the spread of reactor cores, uncertainties from energy non-linearity, etc, the mass hierarchy sensitivity with 6 years of data-taking can reach \u2206\u03c7 2 > 9 with a relative measurement and \u2206\u03c7 2 > 16 with an absolute \u2206m 2 \u00b5\u00b5 measurement from accelerator neutrino experiments. Civil construction has begun and will complete in 2019. Liquid scintillator filling and data taking will begin around 2020.",

The precision on sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) will be improved to 4% in the future. The large value of \u03b8 13 boosts the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the CP violation phase.
