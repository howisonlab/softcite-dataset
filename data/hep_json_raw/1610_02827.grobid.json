The primary trigger (PT) operates using signals from the time-of-flight (TOF) counters and fast signals from the CsI and LKr calorimeters, the secondary trigger (ST) uses optimally shaped calorimeter signals and the information from the VD, DC and TOF systems [19]. Muons are identified in the muon system inside the magnet yoke. The superconducting solenoid provides a longitudinal magnetic field of 0.6 T. The detector is equipped with a tagging system of scattered electrons for two-photon studies. The on-line luminosity measurement is provided by two independent single bremsstrahlung monitors.",

The\u00d1 IP trk is the number of tracks satisfying the conditions above with E/p less than 0.6, where E/p means the ratio of the energy deposited in the calorimeter to the measured momentum of the charged particle. The multiplicity N particles is a sum of the number of charged tracks and the number of neutral particles detected in the calorimeters.

The observable energy cut and limitation on the ratio of the energy of the most energetic photon to the beam energy E max \u03b3 /E beam suppress production of hadronic events at low center-of-mass energies through initialstate radiation and thus reduce the uncertainty of radiative corrections. The total calorimeter energy E cal is defined as a sum of the energies of all clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The cut on it suppresses the machine background. The cut on the ratio of Fox-Wolfram moments H 2 /H 0 is efficient for suppression of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 background, that of cosmic rays and some kinds of the machine background. The background from two-photon and beam-gas events is suppressed by the cut on the ratio |P miss z /E obs |, where P miss z is the z component of missing momentum. The background from beam-gas events was also suppressed by the cut on the ratio E LKr /E cal of the energy deposited in the LKr calorimeter and total calorimeter energy. The event vertex position Z vertex is the weighted average of the z 0 's of the charged tracks. The cut on the |Z vertex | suppresses background due to beam-gas, beam-wall and cosmic rays.",

We apply the MHG2000 generator to simulate hadronic events below 1.84 GeV. This generator simulates about 30 various exclusive modes and approximately reproduces a real picture of e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons below 2 GeV. The x dependencies of the detection efficiencies obtained with the LUARLW and MHG2000 generators for some energies are shown in Fig. 2. Table 6 contains values of the radiative correction and their systematic uncertainties which are discussed in Sec. 5.3.",
