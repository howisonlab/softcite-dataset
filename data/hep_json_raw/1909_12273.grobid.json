The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 9 fb \u22121 . No significant signal is observed in the mass range from 3.4 to 3.8 GeV/c 2 .

The limits are determined as functions of the \u039e + cc mass for different lifetime hypotheses, in the rapidity range from 2.0 to 4.5 and the transverse momentum range from 4 to 15 GeV/c.",

            "text": "The constituent quark model [1][2][3] predicts the existence of weakly decaying doubly charmed baryons with spin-parity J P = 1/2 + . These include one isospin doublet \u039e cc (\u039e + cc = ccd and \u039e ++ cc = ccu), and one isospin singlet \u2126 cc (\u2126 + cc = ccs). The masses of the two \u039e cc states are predicted to be in the range from 3500 to 3700 MeV/c 2 , with an isospin splitting of a few MeV/c 2 [32][33][34]. Predictions of the \u039e + cc lifetime span the range of 50 to 250 fs, while the \u039e ++ cc lifetime is predicted to be three to four times larger due to the W-exchange contribution in the \u039e + cc decay and the destructive Pauli interference in the \u039e ++ cc decay [5,11,12,23,[35][36][37][38][39][40]. Doubly charmed baryons have been searched for by several experiments in the past decades. The SELEX collaboration reported the observation of the \u039e + cc baryon decaying into \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + and pD + K \u2212 final states [41,42], using a 600 GeV/c charged hyperon beam impinging on a fixed target. The mass of the \u039e + cc baryon, averaged over the two decay modes, was found to be (3518.7 \u00b1 1.7) MeV/c 2 . The lifetime was measured to be less than 33 fs at 90% confidence level. It was estimated that about 20% of \u039b + c baryons in the SELEX experiment were produced from \u039e + cc decays [41]. Searches in different production environments by the FOCUS [43], BABAR [44], LHCb [45] and Belle [46] experiments did not confirm the SELEX results. Recently, the \u039e ++ cc baryon was observed by the LHCb experiment in the \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + final state [47], and confirmed in the \u039e + c \u03c0 + final state [48]. The weighted average of the \u039e ++ cc mass of the two decay modes was determined to be (3621.24 \u00b1 0.65 (stat) \u00b1 0.31 (syst)) MeV/c 2 [48], which is about 100 MeV/c 2 higher than the mass of the \u039e + cc baryon reported by SELEX. The lifetime of the \u039e ++ cc baryon was measured to be (0.256 +0.024 \u22120.022 (stat)\u00b10.014 (syst)) ps [49], which established its weakly decaying nature. The \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay has been searched for by the LHCb collaboration with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb \u22121 , but no signal was found [50].",

The analysis strategy is defined as follows: first a search for a \u039e + cc signal is performed and the significance of the signal as a function of the \u039e + cc mass is evaluated; then if the global significance, after considering the look-elsewhere effect, is above 3 standard deviations, the \u039e + cc mass is measured; otherwise, upper limits are set on the production rates for different centre-of-mass energies. Two sets of selections, with different multivariate classifiers and trigger requirements, denoted as Selection A and Selection B are used in these two cases. Selection A is used in the signal search and is designed to maximise its sensitivity. Selection B is optimised for setting upper limits on the ratio of the \u039e + cc production rate to that of \u039e ++ cc and \u039b + c baryons. It uses the same selection for \u039b + c baryons from \u039e cc decays and prompt \u039b + c baryons in order to have better control over sources of systematic uncertainty on the ratio. For the limit setting, only the data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV in 2012 and at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2016-2018 is used. The 2015 data is excluded because there were significant variations in trigger thresholds during this data-taking period, and because this sample only accounts for 6% of the pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [55], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [56,57] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [58]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [59], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The dotted red line indicates the mass of the \u039e + cc baryon reported by SELEX [41,42], and the dashed blue line refers to the mass of the \u039e ++ cc baryon [47,48]. The small enhancement below 3500 MeV/c 2 , compared to the WS sample, is due to partially reconstructed \u039e ++ cc decays. There is no excess near a mass of 3520 MeV/c 2 . A small enhancement is seen near a mass of 3620 MeV/c 2 . To determine the statistical significance of this enhancement, an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the m(\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) distribution. The signal component is described with the sum of a Gaussian function and a modified Gaussian function with power-law tails on both sides [77]. The parameters of the signal model are fixed from simulation except for the common peak position of the two functions that is allowed to vary freely in the fit. The background component is described by a second-order Chebyshev polynomial with all parameters free. A local pvalue is evaluated with the likelihood ratio test for rejection of the background-only hypothesis assuming a positive signal [78,79] and is shown in Figure 2. The largest local significance, corresponding to 3.1 standard deviations (2.7 standard deviations after considering systematic uncertainties), occurs around 3620 MeV/c 2 . Taking into account the lookelsewhere effect in the mass range of 3500 to 3700 MeV/c 2 following ref. [80], the global p-value is 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , corresponding to a significance of 1.7 standard deviations. Since no excess above 3 standard deviations is observed, upper limits on the production ratios are set using the data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV in 2012 and at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2016-2018 after applying Selection B.",

The yield determination procedure of the prompt \u039b + c decays is complicated by the substantial secondary \u039b + c contribution from b-hadron decays, and is done in two steps. First, the total number of \u039b + c candidates is determined with an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the M([pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ] \u039b + c ) distribution. Then, a fit to the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP ) distribution is performed to discriminate between prompt and secondary \u039b + c candidates. Information from the \u039b + c mass fit is used to constrain the total number of \u039b + c candidates. The shapes of the prompt and secondary log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP ) distributions are described by a Bukin function [81]. The shape parameters of the prompt and secondary components are determined from simulation, except for the mean and the width parameters of the Bukin function, which are allowed to vary in the fit. The background component is described by a nonparametric function generated using the data from the \u039b + c mass sideband regions. As an illustration, the M([pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ] \u039b + c ) and log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP ) distributions of the \u039b + c normalisation mode candidates in the 2018 data set are shown in Figure 3. The prompt \u039b + c yields are summarised in Table 1. To determine the \u039e ++ cc yield, an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the m(\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) distribution, which is defined in a similar way to eq. (4). The same signal and background parameterisations are used as for the signal mode. For the data sample recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV, a simultaneous fit is performed to the m(\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) distributions of the candidates in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 data sets with the shared mean and resolution parameter. As an illustration, the m(\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) distribution for the 2018 data set is shown in Figure 4 along with the associated fit result.

To estimate the efficiency for other lifetime hypotheses, the decay time of the simulated \u039e + cc events are weighted to have different exponential distributions and the efficiency is re-calculated. A discrete set of hypotheses (40,80,120, and 160 fs) is motivated by the measured \u039e ++ cc lifetime of 256 fs [49] and the expectation that the \u039e + cc lifetime is three to four times smaller than that of the \u039e ++ cc baryon [5,11,12,23,[35][36][37][38][39][40]. Combining the yields of the normalisation modes obtained in the previous section, the values of the single-event sensitivity of the \u039b + c and \u039e ++ cc modes for several lifetime hypotheses are shown in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. The uncertainties on the single-event sensitivities are due to the limited sizes of the simulated samples and the statistical uncertainties on the measured yields. The efficiency could depend on the \u039e + cc mass, since it affects the kinematic distributions of the decay products of the \u039e + cc baryon. To test other mass hypotheses, two simulated samples are generated with m(\u039e + cc ) = 3518.7 MeV/c 2 and m(\u039e + cc ) = 3700.0 MeV/c 2 . The p T distributions of the three decay products of the \u039e + cc in the simulated sample with m(\u039e + cc ) = 3621.4 MeV/c 2 are weighted to match those in the other mass hypotheses, and the efficiency is re-calculated with the weighted sample. Despite the variations of individual efficiency components, the total efficiency is found to be independent of such variations. The mass dependence can be effectively ignored for the evaluation of the single-event sensitivities.",

No significant signal is observed in the mass range from 3.4 to 3.8 GeV/c 2 . Upper limits are set at 95% credibility level on the ratio of the \u039e + cc production cross-section times the branching fraction to that of the \u039b + c and \u039e ++ cc baryons. The limits are determined as functions of the \u039e + cc mass for different lifetime hypotheses, in the rapidity range from 2.0 to 4.5 and the transverse momentum range from 4 to 15 GeV/c. The upper limit on the production ratio R(\u039b + c ) (R(\u039e ++ cc )) depends strongly on the considered mass and lifetime of the \u039e + cc baryon, varying from 0.45\u00d710 \u22123 (2.0) for 40 fs to 0.12\u00d710 \u22123 (0.5) for 160 fs, as summarised in Table 6. The upper limits on R(\u039b + c ) are improved by one order of magnitude compared to the previous LHCb search [45] and are significantly below the value reported by SELEX [41], albeit in a different production environment. Future searches by the LHCb experiment with further improved trigger conditions, additional \u039e + cc decay modes, and larger data samples should significantly increase the \u039e + cc signal sensitivity.",
