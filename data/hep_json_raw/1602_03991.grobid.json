In 2009, it collected a large dataset using a 190 GeV/c positive hadron beam impinging on a liquid-hydrogen target in order to measure the central exclusive production of light scalar mesons. One of the goals is the search for so-called glueballs, which are hypothetical meson-like objects without valence-quark content. We study the decay of neutral resonances by selecting centrally produced pion pairs from the COMPASS dataset. The angular distributions of the two pseudoscalar mesons are decomposed in terms of partial waves, where particular attention is paid to the inherent mathematical ambiguities. The large dataset allows us to perform a detailed analysis in bins of the two squared four-momentum transfers carried by the exchange particles in the reaction. Possible parameterisations of the mass dependence of the partial-wave amplitudes in terms of resonances are also discussed.",

Many QCDguided models agree in estimating the ground state of these so-called glueballs with scalar quantum numbers J PC = 0 ++ in the mass range from 1.0 to 1.8 GeV/c 2 [1]. However, no unambiguous experimental observation has been reported so far. Grouping mesons in nonets of the approximate flavour-SU(3) symmetry is extraordinarily successful at identifying the ground states predicted by the constituent-quark model in the pseudoscalar-and vector-meson sectors. In contrast, the assignment of the super-numerous scalar isoscalar mesons f 0 (500), f 0 (980), f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500), and f 0 (1710) to one singlet and one octet state is controversial [1,2]. Even if the resonances below 1 GeV/c 2 originate from meson-meson dynamics, the remaining three states could be mixtures of ordinary qq mesons and gluonic excitations. In this context, the masses and widths of the f 0 mesons are crucial for their interpretation, but still much disputed. The COMPASS experiment was proposed in order to make significant contributions to this field.",

A proton beam interacts with a target proton, both stay intact in the reaction and are detected; thus no constituent quarks are exchanged. Centrally produced resonances are identified via their decay into two pseudoscalar mesons. The study of these reactions has a long tradition at CERN, starting from the first evidence for the process at the ISR [3]. Several groups decomposed the distributions observed at the ISR (e.g. [4]) and later at the Omega spectrometer at SPS (e.g. [5], [6]) into partial-wave amplitudes in order to extract the resonant content of the isoscalar S wave. However, both the quantity and quality of the data permitted only the interpretation of the S -wave intensity, disregarding the relative phase with respect to other waves that potentially aids in disentangling resonances from nonresonant components. COMPASS data surpass previous experiments in terms of quantity and precision. In addition, all possible decay modes of the centrally produced system are accessible with the versatile experimental setup. We will focus here on the production of two charged pions.",

These exchange particles carry the squared four-momentum transfers t 1 from the beam proton and t 2 from the target proton to the central system. For the Gottfried-Jackson frame [9], the direction of t 1 is chosen as the quantisation axis.

            "text": "These qualitative statements are confirmed by the decomposition of the binned samples into partial-wave amplitudes. Each two-dimensional bin contains about 4 \u2022 10 5 events, which is sufficient to perform the full partial-wave analysis in mass bins as described above, including the identification of the physical solution via the Barrelet zeros. The width of the mass bins was enlarged to 20 MeV/c 2 to account for the lower number of events. Figure 5 shows the intensity distributions of the S \u2212 0 wave for all bins of (t 1 , t 2 ). For low values of t, the unphysical peak at the \u03c1(770) mass is not visible. It emerges only at higher momentum transfers. A similar situation occurs in the D \u2212 0 wave (cf. Figure 6), where the f 2 (1270) resonance can be observed as an isolated peak for higher momentum transfers and is barely discernible for low values of t. Using the relative phase between both waves, shown in Figure 7, this analysis can disentangle different production mechanisms through their momentum-transfer dependences. To quantify these effects, we study the mass dependence of the amplitudes.",
