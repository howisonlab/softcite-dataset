Measurements of hadron production in a two-dimensional scan in beam momentum (13A-150/158A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, 7 Be+ 9 Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La and Pb+Pb) are conducted in parallel to the RHIC beam energy scan.

            "text": "The NA61/SHINE results on p+p and Be+Be interactions greatly improve the quality of the available data on small systems. They also reveal rapid changes of the energy dependence in the SPS energy range suggesting that some properties of hadron production previously attributed to onset of deconfinement in heavy ion collisions are present also in p+p interactions. Interestingly while the inverse slope parameter in Be+Be collisions lies slightly above the one in p+p interactions, the values of the charged kaon to pion ratio are very close in Be+Be and p+p.   2.1.3. Lambda spectra NA61/SHINE measured \u039b spectra in p+p interactions at 40 [22] and 158 GeV/c [23]. Figure 6 (left) presents the energy dependence of the ratio of total \u039b to \u03c0 multiplicity, compared with other results for p+p and heavy ion collisions. For Pb+Pb collisions this energy dependence shows a maximum in the SPS energy range for ion collisions but not for p+p reactions. A similar maximum is visible in the ratio of total K + to \u03c0 + multiplicities, shown Fig. 6 (right). The observations for Pb+Pb collisions are consistent with the SMES prediction on the energy dependence of the strangeness to entropy ratio at the onset of deconfinement. Comparison of results of fluctuation measurements between various experiments is challenging due to differences in acceptance, volume fluctuations and choice of measures of fluctuations. For this reason only NA61/SHINE results will be presented in this section. Figure 7 (left) shows the scaled variance \u03c9[N] of the multiplicity distributions for p+p, central Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions at 150/158A GeV/c calculated in the NA49 acceptance [24]. Only the 0.2% most central Ar+Sc collisions were used in the analysis in order to eliminate volume fluctuations. Results contradict the Wounded Nucleon Model prediction that the values for heavy systems will be greater or equal to those for p+p.   Figure 8 presents the energy and system size dependence of the \u03a3[P T , N] measure of transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations [8,25]. The results show no beam momentum dependence. The 5% increase from p+p to Ar+Sc is consistent with the estimated magnitude of the systematic uncertainty. The Independent Particle Production Model predicts \u03a3[P T , N] = 1, which is consistent with the presented data [26].",

The spectra are approximately exponential; a deviation from the exponential function at low and high m T in heavier systems indicates collective radial flow.The m T spectra are integrated to derive rapidity spectra, shown for central Ar+Sc collisions at six beam momenta inFig. 2 (right). The spectra are well described by a sum of two symmetrically displaced normal distributions of independent amplitudes.Multiplicities of pions of all charges \u03c0 are calculated by integrating \u03c0 \u2212 rapidity spectra and using phenomenological dependences between multiplicities of pions of various charges[6]. They are shown inFig. 3, compared with results from other experiments[9,10,11]. The values were divided by the average number of wounded nucleons W . For higher SPS energies the slope of the energy dependence is larger for the heavy systems (Pb+Pb, Ar+Sc) than for the light ones (p+p, Be+Be). The Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) predicts an increase of the slope at the onset of deconfinement due to the larger number of degrees of freedom in the quark-gluon plasma[12].",
