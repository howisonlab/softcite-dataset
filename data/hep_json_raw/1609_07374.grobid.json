These Q 2 regions correspond to the four regions of the di-muon mass Q 2 used in the ongoing analyses of the COMPASS Drell-Yan measurements, which allows for a future direct comparison of the nucleon transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions extracted from these two alternative measurements. In addition, for the azimuthal asymmetries induced by the Sivers transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function various two-dimensional kinematic dependences are presented. The integrated Sivers asymmetries are found to be positive with an accuracy that appears to be sufficient to test the sign change of the Sivers function predicted by Quantum Chromodynamics.",

Recent decades were marked by enormous progress in both theoretical and experimental studies of spin-(in)dependent and transversemomentum-dependent (TMD) nucleon PDFs. The latter provide a three-dimensional picture of a fast moving nucleon in momentum space, for recent reviews see Refs. [1][2][3][4][5]. The TMD factorisation was proven to hold [6] for the cross sections of semiinclusive measurements of hadron production in deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering, N \u2192 h X (hereafter referred to as SIDIS) and of lepton-pair production in the Drell-Yan process, h N \u2192 \u00af X (hereafter referred to as DY). This allows comparative studies of the same nucleon TMD PDFs and their dependence on the hard scale Q via TMD evolution. Here, Q 2 is the photon virtuality in SIDIS and Q = Q 2 is the di-muon mass in DY.",

Since the contribution of the Sivers TMD PDF as a \"twist-2\" object is not suppressed at high Q 2 , measurements of the Sivers effect at largely different hard scales can be directly compared.

In the commonly accessible range of the Bjorken-x variable, the Sivers TSA at HERMES was found to be somewhat larger compared to that measured at COMPASS. Taking into account that in this range the hard scale at COMPASS is as much as two to three times larger compared to that of HERMES, this observation may indicate the influence of TMD evolution effects. In order to test this conjecture, measuring TSAs at COMPASS in various Q 2 regions may yield very useful input for testing the effect of TMD evolution.",

Among the five lepton-polarisation-independent TSAs that appear in SIDIS and DY, three are induced by the \"twist-2\" Sivers ( f \u22a5 1T ), transversity (h 1 ), pretzelosity (h \u22a5 1T ) TMD PDFs, while the other two are related to various \"twist-3\" objects [22,23]. Similarly, three SIDIS lepton-polarisation-dependent TSAs give access to \"twist-2\" g 1T and different \"twist-3\" TMDs. In contrast to the Sivers function, transversity, pretzelosity and g 1T TMD PDFs are predicted to be genuinely universal, i.e. their contributions do not change sign between SIDIS and DY [6].",

Comparing the data with predictions from Ref. [28] they conclude that the measured Sivers asymmetry appears to be better compatible with the sign-change scenario for the Sivers TMD PDF than with the one without sign change. Note that these predictions do not include TMD evolution effects and are based on parametrisations of Sivers and unpolarised TMD PDFs that were fitted to asymmetries measured at fixed-target energies [20]. Because of the largely different typical hard scales accessed by fixed-target and collider experiments, it is not excluded that TMD evolution effects play a substantial role when comparing W and Z production to fixed target results. For completeness we note that together with the parametrisations of TMD PDFs at initial scale, the TMD evolution approach needs additional non-perturbative input information that cannot be calculated in pQCD. For various possible choices of this input information, different predictions exist [25][26][27].",

Still, due to partial cancellation of evolution effects in numerator and denominator of the asymmetry, the Sivers TSAs themselves may exhibit only a weak Q 2 -dependence. Available descriptions of the Sivers TSAs, which are based on parametrisations of the unpolarised and polarised TMDs, are driven mostly by the one-dimensional data at low x and low Q 2 from HER-MES and COMPASS, so that present phenomenological studies of Q 2 -evolution are based on fits using the results of two separate experiments. Present models predict for increasing Q 2 a slight increase of the Sivers TSAs for DGLAP and a decrease for TMD evolution. Based on these fits of one-dimensional data, various TMD-evolution models predict different sizes for the DY Sivers TSA in the high mass range, with values between 0.04 to 0.15 [24][25][26][27]. Better constraints on Q 2 -evolution models of TMDs can be expected only from data that are simultaneously differential in x and Q 2 , as the data presented in this Letter.",

Note that the average x-values in different Q 2 -ranges are increasing with Q 2 , as can be seen from Fig. 1. Particularly interesting in Fig. 6 is the comparison of the Sivers TSAs for positive and negative hadrons at low z and low p T (top row). Here, they have small statistical uncertainties and appear to be compatible with one another. Moving towards larger values of z and p T , the two TSAs start to differ. Fig. 6 shows different levels of agreement between our twodimensional data and the predictions that are based on earlier fits of one-dimensional data [19,20]. At low values of z and p T , predictions and data agree within uncertainties. In particular, there is agreement in the region 0.1 < z < 0.2 (top row, left panel), although the corresponding parametrisations were based on a fit to HERMES data in the range z > 0.2 and W > \u221a 10 GeV/c 2 [11] and COMPASS data in the range z > 0.2 and W > 5 GeV/c 2 [13,29]. This suggests that at COMPASS kinematics factorisation appears to hold already in the range of low-z and W > \u221a 10 GeV/c 2 . At higher values of z and p T , clear discrepancies are observed. In particular, at highest z DGLAP curve for positive hadrons exhibits an apparent artefact at about Q 2 \u2248 10 (GeV/c) 2 . It can be expected that new fits including the two-dimensional Sivers TSAs presented in this Letter will better constrain the models.  6.
