The data set corresponding to a total exposure of 54-ton-days is reanalyzed to determine constraints as a function of the WIMP mass and isospin coupling. We obtain WIMP-nucleon cross section bounds of 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221241 cm 2 and 9.0 \u00d7 10 \u221242 cm 2 (90% c.l.) for neutron-only SD and tensor coupling, respectively, for a mass M WIMP \u223c 40 GeV/c 2 . The SD limits are the best currently available for M WIMP > 40 GeV/c 2 . We show that PandaX-II has reached a sensitivity sufficient to probe a variety of other candidate spin-dependent interactions at the weak scale.",

However, the exact nature of DM remains a mystery. One intriguing DM candidate, a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), arises naturally in many extensions of the standard model [1,2]. Many WIMP searches have been performed, including direct detection of their scattering off target nuclei, indirect detection of their decay or annihilation, and their production in collider ex-periments. In the analysis of direct detection experiments, frequently it is assumed that the scattering arises from the light-quark-level (u, s, d) effective interaction",

Limits on the vector spin-independent (SI) and axial spindependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron cross sections \u03c3 SI,SD p,n can then be derived. The recent stringent direct detection null results obtained successively by LUX [4,5], PandaX [6,7] and XENON [8,9,10] have significantly tighten the bounds on \u03c3 SI,SD p,n [11]. The interaction of Eq. (1) was motivated by supersymmetric DM candidates, like the neutralino, that can natu-rally account for the DM relic density. The motivation to focus exclusively on such candidates has weakened due in particular to collider constraints [12]. An alternative approach, effective field theory (EFT) [13,14,15], has gained favor because it allows one to do an analysis [16,17,18,19] free of theory assumptions. One selects an EFT scalee.g., the light-quark or a nucleon scale -and constructs a complete basis of effective operators to a given order, taking into account all general symmetries limiting that basis. The underlying UV theory of DM will reduce at that scale to some definite combination of the basis operators, regardless of its nature. Experimentalists can explore the sensitivities of their detectors to the basis operators, to make sure they are probing all possibilities. The EFT approach has shown 1) relative experimental sensitivities depend on the operator choice, and 2) direct detection is potentially more powerful than might appear from SI/SD analyses, as six (not two) independent constraints on DM can be obtained, in principle [15].",

The nuclear response functions for DM elastic scattering must be calculated before experimental limits can be converted to bounds on the operator coefficients of Eq. (4). For each contributing Xe isotope and needed operator, we performed full-basis shell-model calculations using the GCN5082 [22] interaction (so named because the SM valence space resides between the shell closures at nucleon numbers 50 and 82). The calculations were done without truncation, using the SM code BIGSTICK to treat bases that ranged to 9 billion Slater determinants [23]. Full GCN5082 Xe isotopes response functions are used in the Mathematica script of [24], an update of [15]. This script and the associated library of one-body nuclear density matrices are available on request from the authors of [24]. The scripts of [24] and [15] were carefully crosschecked against one another, to verify their consistency. Figure 1 shows computed recoil energy spectra. The upper panels include the coherent isoscalar (N+Z) and isovector (N-Z) SI responses (operator L 5 int ), which we show for normalization.

For dimension-four operators, the majority of signal events have nuclear recoil energy below 35 keV nr . The overall signal selection efficiency is between 40% and 50%, very similar to that for the SI analysis in Ref. [6]. For dimension-five or dimension-six operators, the analysis is more complicated due to the sharper form factor momentum dependence. For instance, the signal efficiency for the isovector L 9 int operator decreases from 65% to 6.5% as the WIMP mass increases from 40 to 400 GeV. Thus efficiencies can be improved by adjusting search windows according to operator type and WIMP mass, as LUX has described [28]. Such strategies will be explored in future PandaX analyses: detector calibration studies for S1 above 50 PE will be needed to implement such window adjustments. We constrain the WIMP-nucleon EFT couplings d i as a function of the WIMP mass, following the likelihood analysis of Ref. [6]. A standard profile likelihood test statistic was determined as a function of WIMP mass and cross section, and compared with that from a large number of toy MC calculations to derive the upper limits of the signal yields at 90% confidence level (C.L.) [29,30]. The upper panel of Fig. 2 gives PandaX-II bounds on the coherent SI interaction L 5 int as well as the spin-spin interaction L 15 int , related to the traditional SD interaction discussed below. They are well below the nominal weak scale d \u223c 1 over all or almost all WIMP mass range illustrated. The isoscalar coupling limit |d 0 5 | < 5.6 \u2022 10 \u22125 at maximum sensitivity (\u223c 40 GeV WIMP) corresponds to the PandaX-II cross section bound \u03c3 SI p,n < 8.6 \u2022 10 \u221247 cm 2 . But limits on the axial (WIMP) -vector (nucleus) coupling d 0, 1 13 are also at the weak scale, illustrating the power of current-generation experiments to probe momentumor velocity-dependent interactions. The lower panel gives the corresponding bounds for interaction involving WIMP magnetic and electric dipole moments. The bounds are near and in one case (the WIMP electric dipole moment coupling to the nucleon vector current L 17 int ) below the nominal weak scale. Bounds given in the lower panel also include an implicit dimensionless factor representing any needed rescaling of the WIMP moments to their physi-cal values, relative to the nucleon scale we adopted via m M \u223c m N .  Figure 4: PandaX-II exclusion limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section for the standard SD interaction assuming neutron-only (top panel) and proton-only (bottom panel) coupling. The 1\u03c3 sensitivity bands are shown in green. Also shown are recent results from LUX [5], XENON100 [9], ATLAS [31], CMS [32], PICO-2L [33],PICO-60 [34,35], IceCube [36] and Super-K [37].
