The analysis is performed using the final state that contains two leptons (electrons or muons), two jets from a hadronically decaying W boson and large missing transverse momentum. The data used in the measurement correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No evidence of heavy lepton pair production is observed. Heavy leptons with masses below 325-540 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level, depending on the theoretical scenario considered.",

While in the Standard Model (SM) the charged fermions acquire masses by coupling to the Higgs (H) boson, the neutrinos may become massive via new physics beyond the SM, e.g. via the introduction of Majorana mass terms [2]. These masses could be small due to the seesaw mechanism [3,4], which relies on new massive states that couple to a charged lepton and the Higgs field. Among different models for the seesaw mechanism, the type-III model [2,5] introduces at least two extra triplets of fermionic fields with zero hypercharge in the adjoint representation of SU\u00f02\u00de L that generate neutrino masses and couple to gauge bosons. This model predicts new charged and neutral heavy leptons that could be produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.",

            "text": "In this paper, a search for heavy leptons predicted by the type-III seesaw mechanism is presented. The search explores the mass region above 100 GeV. A minimal type-III seesaw model [9] is used to optimize the analysis strategy and interpret the search results. The model introduces a triplet with one neutral and two oppositely charged leptons denoted by N 0 and L AE , respectively. The heavy leptons decay into a SM lepton and a W, Z, or Higgs boson. The heavy leptons are assumed to be degenerate in mass. This assumption does not affect the result because in the case of a small mass splitting due to radiative corrections, the decays within the heavy leptons are highly suppressed [10]. The dominant production mechanism for type-III seesaw heavy leptons in pp collisions is pair production through the weak coupling to the W boson propagator, pp \u2192 W \u00c3 \u2192 N 0 L AE , and the largest branching fraction is the one with two W bosons in the final state, N 0 \u2192 W AE l \u2213 (l \u00bc e; \u03bc; \u03c4) and L AE \u2192 W AE \u03bd (\u03bd \u00bc \u03bd e ; \u03bd \u03bc ; \u03bd \u03c4 ). The production cross section does not depend on the mixing angles between the SM leptons and the new heavy lepton states V \u03b1 ; \u00f0\u03b1 \u00bc e; \u03bc; \u03c4\u00de, which enter only in the expressions for the L and N decay widths. The fraction of L and N decays to lepton flavor \u03b1 is proportional to b \u03b1 \u00bc jV \u03b1 j 2 = \u00f0jV e j 2 \u00fe jV \u03bc j 2 \u00fe jV \u03c4 j 2 \u00de. The limits obtained may be interpreted in terms of a range of mixing angles and Yukawa couplings [9], allowing tests of a range of models with different couplings to gauge bosons and cross section predictions [11,12]. In the type-III seesaw model considered here, a benchmark point is defined by setting V \u03c4 to zero, so that b e and b \u03bc are determined only by the ratio V e =V \u03bc , taken to be 0.87 based on the separately allowed maximum values of V e and V \u03bc in Refs. [13][14][15]. This choice results in values of b e \u00bc0.53, b \u03bc \u00bc0.43, and b \u03c4 \u00bc 0. The search is performed for the process pp \u2192 N 0 L AE \u2192 W AE l \u2213 W AE \u03bd, where one W boson decays leptonically and the other W boson decays hadronically, resulting in a lepton pair in the final state with either the same charge [same sign (SS)] or with the opposite charge [opposite sign (OS)].",

            "text": "The background estimates and their uncertainties are tested in two other regions: a Z \u00fe jets control region and  the hadronic W sidebands. The Z \u00fe jets control region is selected by requiring the invariant mass of the oppositely charged lepton pair to be consistent with the Z boson mass. In this region, approximately 70% of the events are from a Z boson produced in association with jets. The predicted number of events is 34 AE 4, where the error includes both the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and 32 events are observed in the data. For the hadronic W sidebands, the analysis was repeated using the same event selection but requiring the invariant mass of the hadronically decaying W candidate to be 35 < m jj < 60 GeV or 100 < m jj < 125 GeV. This selection provides samples dominated by background events with kinematic properties similar to those of the signal candidates. In this region the predicted number of events is 34 AE 7 events, where the error includes both the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and in the data 18 events are observed. The data are in agreement with the predictions within 1.9 standard deviations. Table I shows the predicted numbers of signal and background events and the observed data events in the signal region. The data agree with the background-only hypothesis. Figure 2 shows the flavor composition of the simulated signal and background events and of the observed events in data. In the absence of any significant data excess, upper limits on the production rate of pp \u2192 N 0 L AE \u2192 W AE l \u2213 W AE \u03bd at the 95% confidence level (C.L.) are derived as a function of the heavy lepton mass using the CL S method [54]. The results of limit calculations combining the observations in the OS and SS final states are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. With the default mixing angles considered here, heavy leptons with masses less than 335 GeV are excluded by the analysis, while masses less than 475 GeV are excluded in the scenario in which heavy leptons can only decay to the Wl or W\u03bd final states. For comparison, upper limits are also calculated for different theoretical assumptions, such as exclusive coupling between the heavy leptons and muons (b e \u00bc 0; b \u03bc \u00bc 1) or electrons (b e \u00bc 1; b \u03bc \u00bc 0). In the limit calculations for exclusive couplings, events in the two-muon (two-electron) final state   are excluded for exclusive electron (muon) coupling. Heavy leptons with a mass below 400 (325) GeV can be ruled out by the data in the case of exclusive coupling to muons (electrons). Masses less than 540 (470) GeV are excluded in the scenario in which heavy leptons can only decay to the Wl or W\u03bd final state.",
