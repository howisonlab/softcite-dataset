In addition, the Z (\u2192 )\u03b3 ( = e or \u03bc) final state can be reconstructed completely with good invariant mass resolution and relatively small backgrounds. There are important improvements in this analysis compared with the previous one [21], including an increase in the size of the data set, an improved event categorisation, and optimised lepton and photon identification criteria. Events with at least one photon and two electrons or muons of opposite charge are classified into six mutually exclusive categories which are designed to enhance the sensitivity to the presence of the SM Higgs boson decaying into Z \u03b3 . The dominant background is the irreducible non-resonant production of Z bosons together with photons. A simultaneous fit to the reconstructed Z \u03b3 invariant mass distributions in all the categories is performed to extract the overall H \u2192 Z \u03b3 signal yield.",

This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger which runs algorithms similar to those in the offline reconstruction software, reducing the event rate to approximately 1 kHz from the maximum L1 rate of 100 kHz. The events were collected with triggers requiring either one or two electrons or muons in the event. Due to the increasing luminosity, the transverse momentum (p T ) thresholds were increased slightly during the data-taking periods. At the highest instantaneous luminosity recorded, the lowest p T threshold for the singlemuon trigger was 26 GeV. For the dimuon trigger, asymmetric p T thresholds of 22 GeV and 8 GeV were used. The p T threshold was 26 GeV for the single-electron trigger and 17 GeV for both electrons in the dielectron trigger. These lowest-threshold triggers were complemented by triggers with higher thresholds but looser lepton identification criteria. For H \u2192 Z \u03b3 events that pass the full analysis selection, described in Section 4, the trigger selection is 95.6% efficient for the ee\u03b3 final state and 92.2% efficient for the \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 final state.

The effects of pile-up were modelled by overlaying simulated inelastic pp events over the original hard-scattering event. The 1 The ATLAS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at pile-up events were generated with Pythia 8.186 [28] using the NNPDF2.3LO set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) [29] and the A3 parameter tune [30]. The MC events were weighted to reproduce the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing observed in the data. In order to improve the description of the data, simulated events were corrected to ensure that the efficiencies for the reconstruction and identification of objects match those measured in data. The corrections include those applied to trigger, reconstruction, identification and isolation efficiencies for electrons and muons, identification and selection efficiencies for photons, and selection efficiency for jets [31,32]. Similarly, momentum and energy scale and resolution corrections for simulated objects were also taken into account.  [60][61][62][63] and it has been shown that higher order QCD corrections have a small impact on the estimated coupling strength [64][65][66]. The production of the SM Higgs boson was modelled with the Powheg-Box v2 Monte Carlo event generator [67][68][69][70][71], as described in Ref. [72] and summarised in Table 1. Pythia 8 [28] was used to simulate the H \u2192 Z \u03b3 decay as well as to provide parton showering, hadronisation and the underlying event. Other Higgs boson production processes are not considered as their contributions to the total Higgs boson production cross-section are of the order of 0.1% or less. All four production modes of the Higgs boson considered contribute to the signal in this analysis and their relative yields were fixed to the SM predictions. Contributions from H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc (where the reconstructed photon originates from QED final-state radiation) were evaluated using samples produced in the same manner and are considered as a potential background in this analysis. The impact of interference between Higgs bosons decays with the same final-state signature (H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 , \u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 /\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) is expected to be negligible in the Standard Model [73] and is neglected.",

This primary vertex candidate is reconstructed from charged particles (tracks) in the ID with transverse momentum p T > 500 MeV, and is defined to be the one with the largest sum of the squared transverse momenta of the associated tracks. Muon candidates are required to have a high-quality track in the ID or the MS, satisfy the medium identification criteria, be within |\u03b7| < 2.7 and have p T > 10 GeV [32]. Electron and photon candidates are reconstructed from topological clusters of energy deposits in the EM calorimeter, and in the case of an electron, a track in the ID matched to the cluster [31,101]. Electron and photon candidates in the transition region between the barrel and endcap EM calorimeters, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, are excluded. Electrons are required to satisfy loose likelihood-based identification criteria [31], have p T > 10 GeV and be within |\u03b7| < 2.47, while photon candidates are required to satisfy p T > 10 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.37 and the tight identification criteria. Compared with the previous AT-LAS publication [21] the electron identification criteria is looser, improving signal acceptance, and the photon identification has been updated to improve efficiency in the transverse momentum range 10 GeV \u2212 35 GeV. The lepton and photon candidates are also required to be isolated from additional activity in the tracking detector and in the calorimeters. Contributions to the energy deposited in the calorimeters originating from the underlying events and pile-up are corrected for on an event-by-event basis using the method described in Refs.

The shape of the m Z \u03b3 distribution for Z + jets events is constructed for each category from a data control region defined by requiring the photon candidate to not satisfy the tight identification criteria but still pass a looser identification criteria. To smooth the statistical fluctuations of the m Z \u03b3 distribution for Z + jets events, an analytic function is fitted to the ratio of the m Z \u03b3 distributions for Z + jets and Z \u03b3 events, in the m Z \u03b3 range of 105-160 GeV. The smoothed m Z \u03b3 distribution for Z + jets events is constructed by multiplying the Z \u03b3 distribution by the fitted ratio.

Smaller effects originate from the parton shower modelling uncertainty (1.3%), PDFs (2.5%) and \u03b1 s (1.9%). The uncertainties in the Higgs boson event kinematics due to missing higher-order QCD calculations impact the distribution of signal events amongst the analysis categories. They are evaluated using an extension of the Stewart-Tackmann method [12,120], based on inputs from Refs. [121][122][123]. Details of how the uncertainty in the acceptance of ggF events in the VBF-enriched category and all other categories is evaluated can be found in Refs. [124] and [21], respectively. Additionally, to account for the uncertainties in the modelling of jet kinematics in ggF events the category acceptance is compared with the acceptance derived from the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample. The Higgs boson and jet kinematics particularly affect the ggF signal acceptance in the VBF-enriched category (37%) and High relative p T category (21%). The effect of parton shower modelling, PDFs and \u03b1 s on the distribution of signal events amongst the analysis categories is less than 11%, 1% and 2%, respectively.

Prior to the present study, the ATLAS Collaboration reported an observed (expected assuming the presence of a SM Higgs boson signal) upper limit on the production cross-section times branching ratio for pp \u2192 H \u2192 Z \u03b3 of 6.6 (5.2) times the SM prediction at 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson with m H = 125.09 GeV using a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 [21]. The CMS Collaboration reported an observed (expected assuming the presence of a SM Higgs boson signal) upper limit of 7.4 (6.0) times the SM prediction for a Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV using a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 [22]. An updated search for decays of the Higgs boson into Z \u03b3 with the Z boson decaying into electron or muon pairs is detailed in this letter. The search uses pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 .",
