Due to the excellent capabilities of the ATLAS detector, and its stable operation in heavy ion as well as proton-proton physics runs, the data allow measurements of the nuclear modification factor, ratio of heavy ion charged particle spectra divided by pp reference, in different centrality classes over a wide range of rapidity. The charged particle nuclear modification factor is found to vary significantly as a function of transverse momentum with a stronger dependence in more peripheral collisions.",

            "text": "The partonic structure of nuclei has been studied extensively in deep inelastic scattering experiments [1]. These measurements have established differences in the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in nuclei from those expected from an incoherent superposition of nucleons. These differences include the phenomena of shadowing, anti-shadowing [2] and the EMC effect [3]. These observations have inspired significant theoretical work (e.g. [4,5,6]), but to date the underlying physics of these phenomena is not completely understood. Proton-ion collisions at the LHC are capable of probing the nucleus at scales that have not been experimentally accessible before. This includes particle production from hard scattering processes with large transverse momentum transfer, q 2 , which may provide crucial insight into the large-q 2 structure of the nucleus or even reveal previously unobserved phenomena.",

The rates of hard scattering processes in heavy ion collisions are enhanced relative to pp collisions due to the increased flux of partons per collision, i.e. the nucleus contains many nucleons capable of participating in a hard scattering. This enhancement depends on the thickness of the target nucleus, T Pb , and on the impact parameter of the projectile. It can be inferred from geometric models such as the Glauber model [7]. The particle yields in p+Pb collisions scaled by the average T Pb can then be compared directly to the cross section for the same process obtained in pp collisions:",

This analysis [8] uses p+Pb data collected with the ATLAS detector [9]  The events used in this analysis are selected from several triggered samples. A minimum bias (MB) samples were obtained requiring signal in the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintilator. For jet triggered samples, jets were reconstructed in events that passed the MB requirement using the anti-k T algorithm [10] with the distance parameter R = 0.4. Events were selected by the jet trigger if they contained jets with E T above a certain threshold. Multiple thresholds were defined. Only a fraction of all events which fired a trigger was randomly selected to be recorded for further analysis. This fraction was set differently for each trigger. Total spectra were obtained by merging spectra from MB and jet triggers, all of them scaled by reciprocal of the fraction to obtain MB spectra up to high p T .",

For p+Pb, a sample of pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV was simulated, but with the output boosted to match the boost due to the asymmetry of the collisions. This simulation output was overlaid onto minimum-bias p+Pb data to get events with generated jets and correct underlying events. Several samples of events were produced for different intervals of generator-level R = 0.4 jet p T , besides the MB samples, in order to obtain good statistics precision over large range in charged particle p T .

The fraction of secondary particles is at most 1% at p T = 4 GeV. The fraction of fake tracks strongly depends on p T and at the highest measured p T reaches 13%. It also depends on rapidity. Next, the resulting spectra are unfolded using the iterative Bayesian unfolding [14] to correct for the finite detector p T resolution.
