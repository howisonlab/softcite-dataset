Selected events feature one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets, exactly one of them identified as originating from a b quark. The cross section is measured by fitting the distribution of a multivariate discriminant constructed with a neural network, yielding \u03c3 t = 83 \u00b14 (stat.) +20 \u221219 (syst.) pb, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model. Using the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted cross section and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |V tb | |V ts |, |V td |, the coupling strength at the W -t-b vertex is determined to be |V tb | = 1.13 +0.14 \u22120.13 . If it is assumed that |V tb | 1 a lower limit of |V tb | > 0.75 is obtained at the 95% confidence level.",

Alternative production modes proceed via the weak interaction involving a W -t-b vertex, leading to a single top-quark intermediate state. Three subprocesses contribute to single top-quark production: the exchange of a virtual W boson in the t-channel, or in the s-channel, and the associated production of a top quark and an onshell W boson. The process with the highest cross section at the Tevatron and at the LHC is the t-channel mode q + b \u2192 q + t.",

The analyses presented in this Letter consider only the t-channel process as signal, while the other two single top-quark processes are treated as backgrounds, assuming the Standard Model (SM) theoretical cross sections for these processes. The W boson from the top-quark decay is reconstructed in its leptonic decay modes e\u03bd, \u03bc\u03bd or \u03c4 \u03bd, where the \u03c4 decays leptonically. Thus, selected events contain one charged lepton candidate, e or \u03bc; two or three hadronic high-p T jets; and missing transverse momentum E miss T . Two jets are expected from the leading-order (LO) process, while a third jet may arise from higher-order processes.

The computation of the t-channel single top-quark process in AcerMC incorporates the q + b \u2192 q + t and q + g \u2192 q + t +b subprocesses and features an automated procedure to remove the overlap in phase space between them [17]. Samples of the top-quark pair (tt) process are generated using MC@NLO (version 3.41) [18], with the CTEQ6.6 set of PDFs [19]. The top-quark mass is assumed to be 172.5 GeV. Generator default values of 0.999105 and 0.999152 are used for |V tb | to produce the AcerMC and MC@NLO samples, respectively. At higher orders in perturbation theory, interference effects between the single-top W t channel and tt processes occur, but are found to be small [20] and can therefore be safely neglected. The ALPGEN leading-order generator (version 2.13) [21] and the CTEQ6L1 set of PDFs [19] are used to generate W + jets, W bb, W cc, W c and Z + jets events with up to five additional partons. To remove overlaps between the n and n + 1 parton samples the \"MLM\" matching scheme [21] is used. The double counting between the inclusive W + n parton samples and samples with associated heavy-quark pair-production is removed utilising an overlap removal based on a R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 matching. 1 The diboson processes W W , W Z and Z Z are generated using HERWIG (version 6.5.20) [22]. For all single top-quark samples the hadronisation is performed by PYTHIA (version 6.4.25) [23]; in all other cases HERWIG in connection with the JIMMY [24] underlying event model (version 4.31) is used. After the event generation, all samples are passed through the full simulation of the ATLAS detector [25] based on GEANT4 [26] and are then reconstructed using the same procedure as for collision data. The simulation includes the effect of multiple pp collisions per bunch crossing and is weighted to the same distribution as observed in the data with 5.6 interactions per bunch crossing on average.",

The main source of object modelling uncertainty comes from the jet energy scale (JES), including the modelling of pile-up, as well as b-jet identification. Other components include lepton energy scale and lepton and jet identification efficiencies. The JES uncertainty has been evaluated using 2010 data [31]. Additional contributions to this uncertainty due to the larger pile-up effects in 2011 data are included and range from less than 1% to 5% as a function of jet p T and \u03b7. For b-quark jets a JES uncertainty of 0.8% to 2.5%, depending on the jet p T , is added in quadrature to the JES uncertainty. Scale factors, determined from collision data [32], are applied to correct the b-tagging performance in simulated events to match the data. Both b-jets and c-jets in simulation use the same b-tagging scale factors with uncertainties that depend on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet. The uncertainties on the scale factors vary from 10% to 15% for b-quark jets and from 20% to 30% for c-quark jets. For light-quark jets the mis-tagging uncertainty ranges from 20% to 50% as a function of jet p T and \u03b7. Other minor uncertainties are assigned to the reconstruction of E miss T and to account for the impact of pile-up collisions on E miss T . Finally, a systematic uncertainty was also assigned to account for temporary failures of parts of the LAr calorimeter readout during part of the data-taking period, which was not modelled in the MC samples.",

The uncertainty due to the choice of the single top-quark t-channel signal generator is estimated from the difference between AcerMC and MCFM predictions [44]. The modelling uncertainty for the tt background is evaluated by comparing the generators MC@NLO and POWHEG [45,46] (with HERWIG showering). For the W + jets background a shape uncertainty is assigned based on the variation of the choices of the matching scale and of the functional form of the factorisation scale in ALPGEN. Systematic uncertainties related to the parton distribution functions are taken into account for the signal and for all background processes which are modelled by simulated events. In addition to the nominal PDF set the alternative MSTW2008nlo68cl [47] and CTEQ6.6 PDF sets are investigated. Events are reweighted according to each of the PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and the total uncertainty is evaluated following the procedure described in Ref. [36].

The separation of candidate events according to the lepton charge allows individual measurements of the top-quark and top-antiquark cross sections, yielding the results \u03c3 (t) = 59 +18 \u221216 pb and \u03c3 (t) = 33 +13 \u221212 pb, that can be compared to the theoretically predicted cross sections of 41.9 +1.8 \u22120.8 pb and 22.7 +0.9 \u22121.0 pb, respectively [9]. To test the compatibility, the two measurements from the NNbased and cut-based analyses are combined using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method [49]. The correlation coefficient of the two analyses is 75% and was determined with ensemble tests including all systematic uncertainties. Based on the ensemble tests the two results are found to be compatible within one standard deviation. However, the combined result and its uncertainty for the observed cross section measurement does not significantly differ from the result obtained with the NN analysis alone.",

The cut-based analysis uses M = 4 channels separated by lepton charge and the number of jets, while in the NN-based analysis M is equal to 28, namely the number of bins of the NN discriminant in the 2-jet channel plus the number of bins of the NN discriminant in the 3-jet channel. Here\u03bd s and\u03bd j are, respectively, the predicted number of signal events and the number of events of background j in the selected data set. The number of observed (expected) events in channel k is denoted by n k (\u03bc k ).The expected number of events in channel k is \u03bc s k for the signal and \u03bc b jk for each background j. The fraction of events falling in channel k is given by \u03b1 s k and \u03b1 jk for signal and background respectively. For the NN-based analysis the sets of \u03b1 s k and \u03b1 jk constitute the probability densities (shapes) of the NN discriminants. The scale factors \u03b2 s for signal and \u03b2 b j for the backgrounds are the parameters of the likelihood function that are fitted to the data. The Gaussian constraints on the background scale factors, j , are set to the theoretical cross section uncertainty for all background processes that do not use data-based estimates (tt, W t, s-channel and diboson), while W + jets backgrounds are constrained within their data-derived uncertainties. The multijet background is fixed to the value estimated from data. The systematic uncertainties on the cross section measurement are determined using a frequentist method based on a large number of pseudo-experiments. For each pseudo-experiment the expectation values of the backgrounds\u03bd j and of the signal\u03bd s as well as the relative distribution of events across the channels (\u03b1 s k and \u03b1 jk ) are varied including all sources of uncertainties described in Section 6 and the t-channel cross section is measured with the maximum-likelihood fit. The distribution of measured cross sections is an estimator of the probability density function of all possible outcomes of the measurement and it is used to estimate the uncertainty on the actual measurement. The NN-based analysis yields, from a simultaneous measurement in the 2-jet and 3-jet channels, a cross section of \u03c3 t = 83 \u00b1 4 (stat.) +20 \u221219 (syst.) pb = 83 \u00b1 20 pb.",
