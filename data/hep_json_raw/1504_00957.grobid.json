The data were collected by the Belle experiment running on the \u03a5(4S) resonance at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider. We measure a branching fraction B(B 0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 ) = (4.1 +1.7+0.5 \u22121.5\u22120.7 ) \u00d7 10 \u22127 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. Our measurement gives an upper limit of B(B 0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 ) < 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90% confidence level. The signal has a significance of 3.0 standard deviations and constitutes the first evidence for this decay mode.",

            "text": "Two-body charmless hadronic decays of B mesons are important for determining Standard Model parameters and for detecting the presence of new physics [1]. The decay B 0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 proceeds mainly via a b \u2192 u Cabibbo-and color-suppressed \"tree\" diagram, and via a b \u2192 d \"penguin\" diagram [2], as shown in Fig. 1. The branching fraction can be used to constrain isospinbreaking effects on the value of sin 2\u03c6 2 (sin 2\u03b1) measured in B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays [3,4]. It can also be used to constrain CP -violating parameters (C \u03b7 K and S \u03b7 K ) governing the time-dependence of B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 K 0 decays [5]. The branching fraction is estimated using QCD factorization [6], soft collinear effective field theory [7], and flavor SU(3) symmetry [8] and is found to be in the range (2 \u2212 12) \u00d7 10 \u22127 .",

Here we update our previous result [12] using the full data set of the Belle experiment running on the \u03a5(4S) resonance at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [14]. This data set corresponds to 753 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs, which is a factor of five larger than that used previously. The analysis presented here also uses improved tracking, photon reconstruction, and continuum suppression algorithms. The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprising CsI(Tl) crystals. These detector components are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil (KLM) is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. Two inner detector configurations were used: a 2.0 cm beampipe and a three-layer SVD were used for the first 123 fb \u22121 of data, while a 1.5 cm beampipe, a four-layer SVD, and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used for the remaining 571 fb \u22121 of data. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [15,16].",
