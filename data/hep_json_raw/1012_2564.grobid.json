This follows from the deep relation between weak and electromagnetic (EM) interactions. The vector weak current and the isovector part of the electromagnetic vector current are different components of the same vector current, so that the matrix element of these currents must be identical assuming SU(2) symmetry. In this case the weak isovector current is assumed to be conserved in analogy to the EM current. This assumption is the CVC hypothesis.",

The direct integration of experimental points in the energy range from 1.25 GeV to the \u03c4 mass using older data samples gives for the branching fraction (0.130 \u00b1 0.015)% in agreement with the previous estimate [10], while that based on the BaBar data gives (0.165 \u00b1 0.015 )%, where we took into account the 8% systematic error claimed by the authors [12]. Since two results differ by more than one standard deviation, we follow the PDG prescription and inflate the uncertainty of their weighted average by a scale factor of 1.67. This gives for the CVC-based branching fraction (0.147 \u00b1 0.018)% in the energy range (1.25 -1.77) GeV. Finally, we add the contribution of the low energy range from 1.0 GeV to 1.25 GeV (based on the BaBar data set) to obtain the total CVC expectation of (0.153 \u00b1 0.018)%. It can be compared to the measured branching fractions which are shown in Table 2 and include both older results from CLEO [19] and ALEPH [20] and the recent experimental result from Belle [21]. Our estimate is consistent within errors with all \u03c4 measurements as well as with their average of (0.139 \u00b1 0.008)%, which is 0.9\u03c3 lower than our CVC-based prediction.",

In general, the two spectral functions are in fair agreement with each other except a few points near the lower and higher boundaries, where the values of F 2 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 [ee] are close to zero. It is also interesting to compare our result wuth earlier theoretical estimates of this branching fraction, see Table 2. It can be seen that the older predictions based on the e + e \u2212 data and CVC agree with the much more accurate result of this work, which uses more precise data, in particular, the recent data sample of BaBar. Other predictions, which are more theoretically driven and use low-energy effective Lagrangians, show a  ",
