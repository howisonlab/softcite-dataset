For m H + < m top , the dominant production mode for charged Higgs bosons at the LHC is via the decay t \u2192 bH + of one of the top quarks in tt events. We present results on the search for such light charged Higgs bosons in the ATLAS experiment, with emphasis on the decay H + \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd.",

            "text": "One major task for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ATLAS experiment is the exploration of the Higgs sector in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. Charged Higgs bosons, H + and H \u2212 , are predicted by several extensions of the SM, such as models containing Higgs triplets and Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM) [1]. Electroweak symmetry breaking through two complex Higgs doublets lead to five physical states, out of which two are charged. The observation of charged Higgs bosons would clearly indicate physics beyond the SM. Here the type-II 2HDM is considered, which is also the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [2]. For values of tan \u03b2 (the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets) larger than 3, typically, charged Higgs bosons decay mainly via H + \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd [3]. In the following, a branching ratio B(H + \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) = 1 is considered.",
