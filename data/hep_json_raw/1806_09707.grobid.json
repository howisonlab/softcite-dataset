Most progress has been seen in the charmonium sector, where tetraquark (pentaquark) candidates with masses around 4 GeV/c 2 have been found decaying to final states containing charmonia and are believed to have a minimal quark content of ccqq (ccqq q ), where q refers to a light quark (u, d, s). Two tetraquark states have also been seen in the bottomonium sector, via their decay to \u03a5 \u03c0 final states [8].",

            "text": "So far, no exotic hadron that is composed of more than two heavy quarks has been observed. However, there have recently been several predictions for the mass and width of an exotic state, X bbbb (denoted by X in the following), with quark composition bbbb [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. These predictions indicate that the X state would have a mass in the region [18.4, 18.8] GeV/c 2 , placing it close to, but typically below, the \u03b7 b \u03b7 b threshold of 18.798 \u00b1 0.005 GeV/c 2 [20], which implies that it could decay to \u03a5 + \u2212 ( = e, \u00b5) final states. Further motivation is provided by the recent observation of \u03a5 (1S)\u03a5 (1S) production by the CMS collaboration [21]. Possible search strategies for the X state have been outlined in ref. [22], and the product of its production cross-section at the LHC and the branching fraction to four muons is estimated to be of O(1 fb). However, recent lattice QCD calculations do not find evidence for such a state in the hadron spectrum [23].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [26].",

            "text": "The relative uncertainties on the \u03c3 \u03a5 (1S) , p 0 and p 1 parameters are 0.1 %, 0.5 % and 46 %, respectively. Since these parameters are weakly correlated with the signal yield their effects on the measured cross-section upper limits are negligible. The uncertainty on the f norm parameter for each dataset is dominated by uncertainties on the normalisation crosssection (2.8 to 6.3 %) and the tracking efficiency correction (0.8 to 3.1 %). The systematic uncertainties from efficiencies related to particle identification or geometrical acceptance are at the level of 1.0 % or less. For the 7 TeV result, a discrepancy is observed in the efficiency-and cross-section-corrected \u03a5 (1S) yield relative to the other datasets. An additional uncertainty of 13.5 % is assigned to account for this. This uncertainty increases the limits on the cross section at 7 TeV by < 4 % and has no effect on the quoted combined limits. The limits reported on the X production cross-section are all statistically dominated.",

For each fixed X mass, the likelihood profile as a function of S is integrated to determine upper limits on the crosssection at 90 % and 95 % confidence levels (CL). This procedure is applied at each of 101 values of the X mass. The 90 % and 95 % CL limits are tabulated in appendix A. Background-only pseudoexperiments are generated at each scan point to determine the expected 95 % CL upper limit and corresponding one and two standard deviation intervals, as shown in figure 4.

[40]. In addition, the effect of the assumption that the X decays according to a phase-space distribution is tested by evaluating the efficiency for both m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) less than 2 GeV/c 2 and m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) greater than 7 GeV/c 2 for the muon pairs that do not come from the \u03a5 (1S) decay. The efficiency varies \u00b124 % with respect to the total efficiency under the assumption of a phase-space decay. Finally, the limits are evaluated using different ranges around the \u03a5 (1S) mass to select the signal dataset, separately for each year of the \u221a s = 13 TeV dataset, and for the 7 and 8 TeV datasets combined. No significant differences are observed in the limits determined in each of these cross-checks. [fb] [fb] [fb] [fb]  ",
