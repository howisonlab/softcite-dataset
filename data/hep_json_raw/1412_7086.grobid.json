The performance of these algorithms is measured in most cases with Z decays to tau leptons using the full 2012 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . An uncertainty on the offline reconstructed tau energy scale of 2-4 %, depending on transverse energy and pseudorapidity, is achieved using two independent methods. The offline tau identification efficiency is measured with a precision of 2.5 % for hadronically decaying tau leptons with one associated track, and of 4 % for the case of three associated tracks, inclusive in pseudorapidity and for a visible transverse energy greater than 20 GeV. For hadronic tau lepton decays selected by offline algorithms, the tau trigger identification efficiency is measured with a precision of 2-8 %, depending on the transverse energy. The performance of the tau algorithms, both offline and at the trigger level, is found to be stable with respect to the number of concurrent proton-proton interactions and has supported a variety of physics results using hadronically decaying tau leptons at ATLAS.",

They can thus only be identified via their decay products. In this paper, only hadronic tau lepton decays are considered. The hadronic tau lepton decays represent 65 % of all possible decay modes [1]. In these, the hadronic decay products are one or three charged pions in 72 and 22 % of all cases, respectively. Charged kaons are present in the e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch majority of the remaining hadronic decays. In 78 % of all hadronic decays, up to one associated neutral pion is also produced. The neutral and charged hadrons stemming from the tau lepton decay make up the visible decay products of the tau lepton, and are in the following referred to as \u03c4 had-vis .",

Other important backgrounds are electrons and, to a lesser degree, muons, which can mimic the signature of tau lepton decays with one charged hadron. In the context of both the trigger and the offline event reconstruction (shortened to simply offline in the following), discriminating variables based on the narrow shower shape, the distinct number of charged particle tracks and the displaced tau lepton decay vertex are used.",

            "text": "Final states with hadronically decaying tau leptons are an important part of the ATLAS physics program. Examples are measurements of Standard Model processes [2][3][4][5][6], Higgs boson searches [7], searches for new physics such as Higgs bosons in models with extended Higgs sectors [8][9][10], supersymmetry (SUSY) [11][12][13], heavy gauge bosons [14] and leptoquarks [15]. This places strong requirements on the \u03c4 had-vis identification algorithms (in the following, referred to as tau identification): robustness and high performance over at least two orders of magnitude in transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis ( p T ) of \u03c4 had-vis , from about 15 GeV (decays of W and Z bosons or scalar tau leptons) to a few hundred GeV (SUSY Higgs boson searches) and up to beyond 1 TeV (Z searches). At the same time, an excellent energy resolution and small energy scale uncertainty are particularly important where resonances decaying to tau leptons need to be separated (e.g. Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 from H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 mass peaks). The triggering for final states which rely exclusively on tau triggers is particularly challenging, e.g. H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 where both tau leptons decay hadronically. At the trigger level, in addition to the challenges of offline tau identification, bandwidth and time constraints need to be satisfied and the trigger identification is based on an incomplete reconstruction of the event. The ATLAS trigger system, together with the detector and the simulation samples used for the studies presented, are briefly described in Sect. 2.",

The combination of L2 and the EF are referred to as the high-level trigger (HLT). The L1 trigger identifies regions-of-interest (RoI) using information from the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer. The delay between a beam crossing and the trigger decision (latency) is approximately 2 \u00b5s at L1. The L2 system typically takes the RoIs produced by L1 as input and refines the quantities used for selection after taking into account the information from all subsystems. The latency at L2 is on average 40 ms, but can be as large as 100 ms at the highest instantaneous luminosities. At the EF level, algorithms similar to those run in the offline reconstruction are used to select interesting events with an average latency of about 1 s.",

Therefore, most analyses using lowp T \u03c4 had-vis in 2012 depend on the use of triggers which identify other objects. However, by combining tau trigger requirements with requirements on other objects, lower thresholds can be accommodated for the tau trigger objects as well as the other objects. Figure 1 shows the tau trigger rates at L1 and the EF as a function of the instantaneous luminosity during the 8 TeV LHC operation. The trigger rates do not increase more than linearly with the luminosity, due the robust performance of the trigger algorithms under different pile-up conditions. The only exception is the \u03c4 had-vis + E miss T trigger, where the extra pile-up associated with the higher luminosity leads to a degradation of the resolution of the reconstructed event E miss T . At the highest instantaneous luminosities, the rates are affected by deadtime in the readout systems, leading to a general drop in the rates.",

Separate BDT algorithms are trained for 1-track and 3track \u03c4 had-vis decays using a combination of simulated tau leptons in Z , W and Z decays. For the jet background, large collision data samples collected by jet triggers, referred from now on as the multi-jet data samples, are used. For the signal, only reconstructed \u03c4 had-vis candidates matched to the true (i.e., generator-level) visible hadronic tau decay products in the region around R < 0.2 with p true T,vis > 10 GeV and |\u03b7 true vis | < 2.3 are used. In the following, the signal efficiency is defined as the fraction of true visible hadronic tau decays with n charged decay products, which are reconstructed with n associated tracks and satisfy tau identification criteria. The background efficiency is the fraction of reconstructed \u03c4 had-vis candidates with n associated tracks which satisfy tau identification criteria, measured in a background-dominated sample. Three working points, labelled tight, medium and loose, are provided, corresponding to different tau identification efficiency values. Their signal efficiency values (defined with respect to 1-track or 3-track reconstructed \u03c4 had-vis candidates matched to true \u03c4 had-vis ) can be seen in Fig. 4. The requirements on the BDT score are chosen such that the resulting efficiency is independent of the true \u03c4 had-vis p T . Due to the choice of input variables, the tau identification also shows stability with respect to the pile-up conditions as shown in Fig. 4. The performance of the tau identification algorithm in terms of the inverse background efficiency versus the signal efficiency is shown in Fig. 5. At low transverse momentum of the \u03c4 had-vis candidates, 40 % signal efficiency for an inverse background efficiency of 60 is achieved. The signal efficiency saturation point, visible in these curves, stems from the reconstruction efficiency for a true \u03c4 had-vis with one or three charged decay products to be reconstructed as a 1-track or 3-track \u03c4 had-vis candidate. The main sources of inefficiency are track reconstruction efficiency due to hadronic Offline tau identification efficiency dependence on the number of reconstructed interaction vertices, for a 1-track and b 3-track \u03c4 had-vis decays matched to true \u03c4 had-vis (with corresponding number of charged decay products) from SM and exotic processes in simulated data.

This creates a significant background contribution after all the jet-related backgrounds are suppressed via kinematic, topological and \u03c4 had-vis identification criteria. Despite the similarities of the \u03c4 had-vis and electron signatures, there are several properties that can be used to discriminate between them: transition radiation, which is more likely to be emitted by an electron and causes a higher ratio f HT of high-threshold to lowthreshold track hits in the TRT for an electron than for a pion; the angular distance of the track from the \u03c4 had-vis calorimeterbased direction; the ratio f EM of energy deposited in the EM calorimeter to energy deposited in the EM and HAD calorimeters; the amount of energy leaking into the hadronic calorimeter (longitudinal shower information) and the ratio of energy deposited in the region 0.1 < R < 0.2 to the total core region R < 0.2 (transverse shower information). The distributions for two of the most powerful discriminating variables are shown in Fig. 8. These properties are used to define a \u03c4 had-vis identification algorithm specialized in the rejection of electrons misidentified as hadronically decaying tau leptons, using a BDT. The performance of this electron veto algorithm is shown in Fig. 9. Slightly different sets of variables are used in different \u03b7 regions. One of the reasons for this is that the variable associated with transition radiation (the leading track's ratio of high-threshold TRT hits to low-threshold TRT hits) is not available for |\u03b7| > 2.0. Three working points, labelled tight, medium and loose are chosen to yield signal efficiencies of 75, 85, and 95 %, respectively.",

The statistical uncertainty improvements that could be obtained by the addition of the electron channel are offset by the larger systematic uncertainties associated with this channel. The systematic uncertainties are also different from those in the offline identification measurement, since the purity after identification is already high. The systematics are dominated by the uncertainties on the modelling of the kinematics of the background events, rather than the total normalization, as is the case for the offline identification measurement.",

For anti-k t jets with a distance parameter R = 0.4, this calibration accounts for the noncompensating nature of the ATLAS calorimeters and for energy deposited outside the reconstructed clusters and in non-sensitive regions of the calorimeters. However, it is neither optimized for the cone size used to measure the \u03c4 had-vis momentum ( R = 0.2) nor for the specific mix of hadrons observed in tau decays; and it does not correct for the underlying event or for pile-up contributions. Thus an additional correction is needed to obtain an energy scale which is in agreement with the true visible energy scale, thereby also improving the \u03c4 had-vis energy resolution. This correction (also referred to as a response curve) is computed as a function of E \u03c4 LC using Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events simulated with Pythia8.

The central idea is to decompose each tau lepton into its decay products and to combine the calorimeter responses according to the branching ratios of tau leptons to the various hadronic final states. The response to charged hadrons is estimated from different sources depending on the momentum and pseudorapidity; in-situ E/ p measurements are used at low momentum, combined test beam measurements are used at high momentum in the central region (|\u03b7| < 0.8), and simulation is used otherwise (here, the uncertainty is estimated using events simulated using different hadronic shower models). The response to electromagnetic showers was studied in Z \u2192 ee decays and is used for neutral pions. Pseudo-experiments are used to propagate the singleparticle response uncertainties to the reconstructed hadronically decaying tau lepton. In each pseudo-experiment, the tau decay product energies are varied randomly using Gaussian distributions centred on the observed ratio of the response in data and simulation and with a width corresponding to the statistical uncertainty, and Gaussian distributions centred at unity and with widths given by each systematic uncertainty. These distributions depend on particle type, energy and pseudorapidity. The TES shift for a single pseudo-experiment is given by the mean of the energy ratio of the \u03c4 had-vis to an identical pseudo-experiment in which only statistical uncertainties of the measurement are considered by Gaussian distributions centred at unity.

Here, m vis is defined as the invariant mass of the \u03c4 had-vis and the muon. The muon momentum scale is measured independently with high precision. The TES shift \u03b1 is determined by introducing an energy shift E T \u2192 (1 + \u03b1)E T for \u03c4 had-vis objects and finding the value \u03b1 for which the m vis peak position in data and simulation agrees. A fifth-order polynomial fit is used to estimate the m vis peak position as simulation studies show that this gives both the highest sensitivity and robustness. For small values of \u03b1, the m vis peak position depends linearly on E T . The results are based on collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2012 using a muon trigger threshold of 24 GeV. The event selection is similar to the one used by the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 tag-and-probe studies described in Sect. 4.1 with the following differences: the \u03c4 had-vis candidates are required to have E T > 20 GeV and to satisfy medium tau identification criteria.

No significant dependence on \u03b7 or pile-up conditions is observed. The corrections are positive, i.e. the momen- tum of \u03c4 had-vis in data has to be scaled up in order to yield agreement (on average) with simulation, and are in agreement with the bias observed in data using the deconvolution method. The resulting m vis distribution for data and simulation is shown in Fig. 17 before applying any correction (i.e., \u03b1 = 0). The uncertainties given above only account for differences between data and simulation and not in the absolute TES. For the latter, uncertainties due to non-closure and pile-up conditions estimated with the deconvolution method have to be added in quadrature to the systematic uncertainties given above.",

            "text": "As described in Sect. 3.3, reconstructed \u03c4 had-vis candidates at both L1 and L2 use a dedicated energy reconstruction algorithm which differs from the offline \u03c4 had-vis energy reconstruction and calibration, while at the EF, the same algorithm is used. In this section, comparisons of the online energy calibrations between data and simulation are shown. The measured transverse energy resolution for offline \u03c4 had-vis candidates passing medium tau identification is shown in Fig. 18 at all three trigger levels. This measurement is carried out using the same methodology as described in the previous section. The reconstructed energy at L1 is underestimated since at this level calorimeter energies are calibrated at the EM scale. The overestimation seen at L2 is due to the clustering algorithm used at L2, which does not implement the same noise suppression scheme as offline. At the EF, the energy reconstruction is almost identical to the offline case. The slight difference with respect to the offline energy resolution is mainly due to the pile-up corrections, which are only applied offline. Some discrepancies can be seen between the resolutions measured in data and in simulation. This reinforces the importance of having a trigger efficiency measurement performed directly in data as a function of the offline \u03c4 had-vis p T , as presented in Sect. 4.2. The algorithms developed in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for tau identification and tau energy calibration are described, along with their optimization and the associated procedures to mitigate the effects of pile-up. These algorithms were employed in the dataset corresponding to 20.3 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collisions. The performance of the tau algorithms have helped to fulfil a variety of physics searches and measurements with hadronically decaying tau leptons, an important part of the ATLAS physics program. The performance of trigger and offline tau identification and calibration is measured, in most cases using Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 tagand-probe measurements. The uncertainties on the offline (c) Fig. 18 The measured tau trigger transverse energy resolution for the offline \u03c4 had-vis candidates passing medium tau identification at a L1, b L2 and c the EF. The grey hashed area reflects the statistical uncertainties on the sum of the expected signal and background tau identification efficiency measurement are dependent on the working point and are about (2-3) % for \u03c4 had-vis with one associated track, and (4-5) % for the case of three associated tracks, inclusive in \u03b7 and for a visible transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV. A precision of (2-8) % for the tau trigger identification efficiency is measured for hadronic tau decays selected by offline algorithms, depending on the transverse energy. Stability of all algorithms with respect to the pile-up conditions is observed. The reconstructed tau energy scale is measured with a precision of about (2-4) % depending on transverse energy and pseudorapidity, using either a method based on estimating and deconvolving the response uncertainties of the hadronic tau decay products or a direct measurement of the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 visible mass using collision data recorded in 2012. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
