The cross-section \u03c3 \u03b3 * g\u2192cc of this photon-gluon fusion (PGF) process and its dependence on the relative polarization of photon and gluon can be calculated in perturbative QCD [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Thus, using polarized muons and polarized nucleons, a measurement of the photon nucleon cross-section asymmetry \u0394\u03c3 \u03b3 * N \u2192ccX /\u03c3 \u03b3 * N \u2192ccX allows the determination of the gluon polarization \u0394g/g in the nucleon. With this objective, open charm production has been studied in the COMPASS experiment at CERN for longitudinally polarized muons interacting with longitudinally polarized deuterons. The incoming muon energy of 160 GeV was chosen, since the cross-section difference \u0394\u03c3 \u03b3 * N \u2192ccX for parallel and anti-parallel spins of photon and nucleon reaches a maximum for virtual photon energies around 80 GeV according to most models for the gluon helicity distribution function \u0394g(x Bj , Q 2 ), and the polarization transfer from muon to virtual photon is large in the relevant photon energy range.",

In addition to the PGF other production mechanisms also contribute in this case, like gluon-gluon fusion to cc from a resolved photon. The hadronizations of c andc can more safely be assumed to be independent. COMPASS covers a complementary kinematic region with virtual photon energies in the range from threshold at about 30 GeV up to 140 GeV in the laboratory frame. Prior to COMPASS, this energy range was covered only by the EMC experiment [21], which collected about 90 D 0 meson events produced by deep inelastic scattering of 240 or 280 GeV muons on hydrogen and deuterium targets for a study of the charm production mechanism. Only one charm photo-production experiment explored the region close to threshold [22], while two concentrated on high energy photons [16,23].",

The kinematic distributions of events from signal and background regions are shown in Sect. 5. They are based on the entire available data sample collected during the years 2002-2006, and are not corrected for acceptance. The purpose of this section is to compare the distributions of open charm to those of background events. Section 6 describes the acceptance correction and luminosity calculation needed to extract the total and differential semi-inclusive cross sections for charm production. They are performed for the 2004 data only. In Sect. 7, the differential cross-sections as a function of the various kinematic variables and the total cross-section obtained by integration are shown and compared with the AROMA predictions for the production of D mesons by PGF. Significant differences between D * + and D * \u2212 meson production are observed for the acceptancecorrected data from 2004. A statistically more precise comparison of D * + and D * \u2212 production is based on the entire data sample (2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006). Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are determined under the assumption, which is verified for the 2004 data, that the D * + and D * \u2212 acceptances are equal to a good approximation.",

All tracks with momentum measured in one or both spectrometer stages and falling within the geometrical acceptance of the RICH are used to calculate the likelihoods (LKs) that the Cherenkov photons detected by the RICH are due to electron, muon, pion, kaon, proton, or background. The LK for a specific particle is calculated only if the particle velocity is above the threshold for the emission of Cherenkov photons in the radiator gas. This threshold depends on the refractive index that is extracted from the data on a run-by-run basis. For pions, kaons, and protons, this gives an average momentum threshold of 2.5, 8.9 and 16.9 GeV/c respectively. At large momenta pions and kaons cannot be efficiently separated, thus it is required that the momentum of the particle is below 50 GeV/c. In the tagged D 0 sample, due to the small mass difference between the D * (2010) and the D 0 (1865), only a limited energy is available for the pion produced in the D * \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 s decay.

This resonance follows the same behaviour as the K * 2 (1430) resonance, i.e. it is produced at larger values of z than the D 0 (see Sect. 5). The introduction of the K * 3 (1780) resonance in the final fit also removed a small but statistically significant and unexplained discrepancy between fit and data on the left side of the D 0 \u2192 K\u03c0 peak in the z-integrated spectrum, where the fit before the inclusion of the K * 3 (1780) was systematically below the data (see Fig. 5g to be compared with Fig. 3b, where the K * 3 (1780) has been included). The second method for signal extraction is the standard side-band subtraction. This method can only be applied to the D 0 and the D * signals, due to the limited mass range (\u00b1700 MeV around the nominal D 0 mass). Three K\u03c0 mass windows are chosen. The central one, which is 100 MeV wide and centered at the nominal D 0 mass, contains the D 0 \u2192 K\u03c0 signal plus background. The two side-bands contain only background events. They are 50 MeV wide and centered at \u00b1100 MeV above or below the nominal D 0 mass. Thus three independent distributions are obtained as Usually, the background below the signal is obtained by linear interpolation between the side-bands. Such a linear interpolation overestimates the background under the signal. Therefore it cannot be applied for the untagged D 0 sample, where S/B \u223c 1/10. Instead, an estimate of the background under the signal is obtained from the fit. The total number of background events in the two side-bands is correspondingly rescaled.",

Since this is the first detailed acceptance calculation for this particular final state at COMPASS, the present section also aims at illustrating the acceptances of the COM-PASS spectrometer for the detection of the scattered muon and the D * \u00b1 . For this reason, 2-dimensional acceptances will be shown as a function of selected variables. Acceptance calculations are done using a complete Monte Carlo simulation of the detector configuration, including the triggers and the track reconstruction code for the 2004 data. Events are generated using AROMA 2.2.4 [10], which assumes photon-gluon fusion into cc to be the dominant underlying mechanism for D * production. Default fragmentation functions are used and parton showers are generated. The charm quark mass is set to 1.35 GeV. Produced D * s are forced to decay to D 0 \u03c0 + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + for D * + or toD 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 for D * \u2212 . Trigger conditions and data selection criteria applied to the Monte Carlo events are the same as for real data. In total, 10 7 events were generated for both decays. The acceptances are calculated as a function of the reconstructed values of the kinematic variables, thus accounting for experimental resolution and bin-to-bin smearing. Figure 7 shows the number of generated events (a) as a function of x Bj , y and (b) as a function of p \u22a5 , E of the D meson. The transverse momentum p \u22a5 is measured with respect to the direction of the incoming muon beam. In both pictures the generated events are mainly concentrated in the lower left corner.",

In the following, the semi-inclusive differential crosssections for D * \u00b1 production, determined for data from the year 2004 only, will be obtained separately for D * + and D * \u2212 . The acceptances, the integrated luminosity and the known branching ratio (2.6 %) of D * to K\u03c0\u03c0 are taken into account. At the end of this section, D * + and D * \u2212 asymmetries will be shown for all 2002 to 2006 data, since integrated luminosity and also the acceptances cancel in these asymmetries to a good approximation. Figure 11 displays the semi-inclusive differential crosssections of D * + and D * \u2212 events as a function of \u03bd, E, z and p 2 T . The numerical values of the measured differential cross-sections are compiled in Table 1. These cross-sections are compared with the theoretical predictions obtained from the AROMA generator, which assumes cc production via photon gluon fusion, uses CTEQ2L as default LEPTO [29] PDFs and includes parton showers. The AROMA total cross-section is rescaled to the value of 1.9 nb measured by COMPASS, see below. They were calculated using the same program package parameters as those for the determination of acceptances.

Differences may occur for all processes where the quark content of the target nucleon matters. The quark content of D * mesons indicate that only D * \u2212 may contain a valence quark from the target nucleon.

The observed large asymmetries between D * + and D * \u2212 production for \u03bd < 40 GeV and z > 0.6 can only partially be described by the model used in AROMA, which predicts differences of the same sign but of smaller magnitude.
