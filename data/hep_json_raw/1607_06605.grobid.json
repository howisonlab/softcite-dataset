An integrated luminosity of 500 \u03bcb \u22121 was accumulated in a special run with high-\u03b2 beam optics to measure the differential elastic cross section as a function of the Mandelstam momentum transfer variable t.

Each station houses two vertically moveable scintillating fibre detectors which are inserted in RPs and positioned close to the beam for data taking. Each detector consists of 10 modules of scintillating fibres with 64 fibres on both the front and back sides of a titanium support plate. The fibres are arranged orthogonally in a u-v-geometry at \u00b145 \u2022 with respect to the y-axis. 1 The spatial resolution of the detectors is about 35 \u03bcm. Elastic scattering events are recorded in two independent arms of the spectrometer. Arm 1 consists of two upper detectors at the left side and two lower detectors at the right side, and arm 2 consists inversely of two lower detectors at the left and two upper detectors at the right side. Events with reconstructed tracks in all four detectors of an arm are referred to as \"golden\" events [1]. The detectors are supplemented with trigger counters consisting of plain scintillator tiles. The detector geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1 of Ref. [1]. All scintillation signals are detected by photomultipliers coupled to a compact assembly of front-end electronics including the MAROC chip [15,16] for signal amplification and discrimination. The entire experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 2 of Ref. [1].",

Precise positioning of the RPs is achieved with a beam-based alignment procedure which determines the position of the RPs with respect to the proton beams by monitoring the rate of the LHC beam-loss monitors during the RP insertion. The data were collected with the RPs at a distance of approximately 7.5 mm from the beam centre, corresponding to 9.5 times the vertical beam width. The beam centre and width monitored by LHC beam position monitors and the ATLAS beam-spot measurement [20] were found to be stable to within 10 \u03bcm during the run. The beam emittance was derived from the width of the luminous region in conjunction with the beam optics. It was supplemented by direct measurement from ALFA in the vertical plane. The luminosity-weighted average of the emittance in the vertical plane was determined to be 1.6 \u03bcm for both beams and between 1.8 \u03bcm and 2.5 \u03bcm for beam 1 and beam 2 respectively in the horizontal plane.

First, the distance between the upper and the lower detectors is determined by the use of dedicated ALFA overlap detectors which allow simultaneous measurements of the same particle in the upper and lower half of a station. Then, the detector positions are directly determined from the elastic-scattering data, using the fact that the high-\u03b2 optics and the azimuthal symmetry of the scattering angle result in elastic hit patterns that have an ellipsoidal shape elongated in the vertical direction. Three alignment parameters are determined for each detector: the horizontal and vertical offsets and the rotation angle around the beam axis. For the horizontal offset the centre of the x-distribution is taken and the rotation is obtained from a linear fit to a profile histogram of the x-y correlation. The vertical offset is obtained from a comparison of the yields in the upper and lower detectors using the sliding window technique [1]. The above procedures provide an independent alignment of each ALFA station. The vertical alignment parameters are in addition fine-tuned, exploiting the strong correlations between positions of tracks measured by different detectors in elastic events. First, the positions measured in one detector are extrapolated to the other detectors in the same arm using the ratio of the appropriate M 12 matrix elements. Then, the extrapolated positions are compared to the corresponding measurements -the ",

The back-to-back topology of elastic events is further exploited to clean the sample by imposing cuts on the left-right acollinearity. The difference between the absolute value of the vertical coordinate at the A-and C-side is requested to be below 3 mm. For the horizontal coordinate the correlation of the A-and C-sides is used.

Elastic events are concentrated inside a narrow ellipse with negative slope, whereas the beam-halo background appears in broad uncorrelated bands. The most efficient selection against background is obtained from the correlation between the position in the horizontal plane and the local angle between two stations, where events on either side are again required to be inside an ellipse of 3.5\u03c3 width.

The fraction of elastic events in the subsample where one out of four detectors failed to reconstruct a track is above 99%, whereas this fraction is 95% for the subsample where two detectors failed to reconstruct a track on one side. The event yields in the different categories are calculated with a data-driven method, for which the details are given in Ref. [1]. The background fraction in the case with only two detectors with reconstructed tracks is estimated with background templates of the x distribution, obtained from data by selecting single diffractive events. In the case of a successful track reconstruction in three detectors, where a good t-measurement is still possible, the partial reconstruction efficiency was verified to be independent of t, which is then also assumed for the other categories. Events falling outside the acceptance, but faking a signal through shower development, were eliminated from the reconstruction efficiency calculation by applying another template analysis using the y distribution obtained from golden elastic events.

On the other hand, an additional method based on vertex counting in the inner detector (ID) can be exploited, which is most effective at low pile-up. Another consequence of the low luminosity is the relative importance of the background sources: the beam-gas contribution, normally negligible, can become comparable with the collision rate, while the \"afterglow\" background (see Ref.

The optical theorem is used to extract the total cross section from the differential elastic cross section by extrapolating t \u2192 0. The differential cross section is also used to determine the nuclear slope. The analysis uses data-driven methods to determine relevant beam optics parameters and event reconstruction efficiency, and to tune the simulation. The detailed evaluation of the associated systematic uncertainties is supplemented by a comparison of t-reconstruction methods with different sensitivities to beam optics. The absolute luminosity for this run is determined in a dedicated analysis, taking into account the special conditions with a very low number of interactions per bunch crossing. The total cross section at \u221a s = 8 TeV is determined to be [13] ATLAS Collaboration, Measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, arXiv:1606.02625 [hep-ex],",

Finally the stability of the analysis was tested by a wide variation of the event selection cuts. The largest change of \u03c3 tot with these cut variations was observed for the cut on the correlation between x and \u03b8 x . That produced a change of \u00b10.3 mb, well within the t-dependent experimental systematic uncertainty of about 0.5 mb. Several alternative parameterizations[22,26,28,27,[29][30][31] of the differential elastic cross section, including nonexponential forms at large t, were used to fit the spectrum up to \u2212t = 0.3 GeV 2 in order to assess the impact on the value of the total cross section. The RMS of the values obtained is 0.28 mb, in good agreement with the quoted extrapolation uncertainty of 0.31 mb assigned to the simple exponential form.The TOTEM Collaboration exploited data from the same LHC fill for a measurement of \u03c3 tot using the luminosity-independent method. Their result is \u03c3 tot = 101.7 \u00b1 2.9 mb [3], higher than the measurement presented here. The difference corresponds to 1.9\u03c3 assuming uncorrelated uncertainties. Better agreement is observed in the nuclear slope measurement, where TOTEM reports",
