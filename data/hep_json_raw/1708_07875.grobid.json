W (\u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 ) + jets events contribute due to the E miss T from the neutrino, one tau lepton from the W decay, and one or more jets misidentified as tau leptons. The jet misidentification typically results in a mismeasurement of E miss T , which tends to assume large values.

The ID covers the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5 and consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector, and a transition radiation tracker. One significant upgrade for the \u221a s = 13 TeV running period is the presence of the insertable B-Layer [38], an additional pixel layer close to the interaction point which provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking and vertex reconstruction performance. The calorimeters are composed of high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters with lead, copper, or tungsten absorbers (in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 3.2) and a steel-scintillator hadronic calorimeter (for |\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. The MS surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets, each with eight coils, a system of precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7), and detectors for triggering (|\u03b7| < 2.4).

The tau reconstruction algorithm is seeded by jets reconstructed as described above but with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The reconstructed energies of the hadronically decaying tau candidates are corrected to the tau energy scale, which is calibrated based on simulation and in-situ measurements using Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays. Tau neutrinos from the tau lepton decay are not taken into account in the reconstruction and calibration of the tau energy and momentum. Hadronic tau decay candidates are required to have one or three associated charged-particle tracks (prongs) and the total electric charge of those tracks must be \u00b11 times the electron charge. To improve the discrimination between hadronically decaying tau leptons and jets, electrons, or muons, multivariate algorithms are used [85]. The tau identification algorithm is based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) method. The BDT algorithms use various track and cluster variables as input to discriminate tau leptons from jets. For 1-prong (3-prong) tau candidates, the signal efficiencies are 60% (50%), 55% (40%), and 45% (30%) for the 'loose', 'medium', and 'tight' working points, respectively. In the following, tau candidates are required to satisfy the medium identification criteria for jet discrimination ('medium' tau candidates), unless otherwise stated. For electron discrimination, an overlap-based veto is used for 1-prong tau candidates. This requirement has about 95% efficiency, and a rejection factor from 10 to 50 depending on the \u03b7 range. Tau candidates are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47, excluding the tran-sition region between the barrel and end-cap calorimeters (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52).",

The latter is dominated by gu/gd-initiated processes that often give rise to a jet originating from a quark, the charge of which is anti-correlated with the W boson charge.

The uncertainties in the energy and momentum scale of each of the objects entering the E miss T calculation are estimated, as well as the uncertainties in the soft-term resolution and scale. A variation in the pile-up reweighting of the MC simulated event samples is included to cover the uncertainty in the ratio of the predicted and measured inelastic cross section in the fiducial volume defined by M X > 13 GeV where M X is the mass of the hadronic system [95]. The main contributions to experimental systematic uncertainties in the SR-lowMass (SR-highMass) are from the tau lepton identification and energy scale around 6% (8%), jet energy scale and resolution around 11% (4%), E miss T soft-term resolution and scale around 2% (6%), and pile-up around 8% (8%).

For W + jets and diboson processes, the uncertainties related to the choice of the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales are estimated from the comparison of the nominal samples with samples with these scales varied up and down by a factor of two. Uncertainties in the resummation scale and the matching scale between the matrix elements and parton shower are evaluated by varying up and down the corresponding parameters in Sherpa by a factor of two. For W + jets events, the uncertainty due to the jet p T threshold used for parton-jet matching is estimated by comparing the baseline samples with jet p T threshold set to 20 GeV to samples with a threshold of 15 or 30 GeV. Sherpa is compared with MadGraph to estimate the uncertainty related to the generator choice for W + jets production. The total theoretical uncertainty for diboson processes in the SRs is around 15%, mainly coming from the choice of QCD renormalisation scale (4-9%) and resummation scale (around 10%). The theory uncertainty in W + jets production is 13-20%, and the main source is the event generator uncertainty (4-17%) and the QCD renormalisation scale (9-10%). An overall systematic uncertainty of 6% in the inclusive cross section is assigned to the diboson process. Based on previous studies [29], a total theoretical uncertainty of 25% is assigned for the top-quark and Z + jets contributions to the SRs.",
