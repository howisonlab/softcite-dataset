In the QCD parton model four of these asymmetries can be interpreted within the leading order approach. Two of them, namely Collins and Sivers effects were already measured by HERMES and COMPASS experiments. Other two leading twist and remaining four azimuthal asymmetries which can be interpreted as twist-three contributions have been measured for the first time in COMPASS using a 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized (P l \u2243 \u22120.8) muon beam and a transversely polarized 6 LiD target. We present here the preliminary results from the 2002-2004 data.",

COMPASS has already started data taking with the proton target, and the transverse spin effects, in this case, are expected to be more significant.",
