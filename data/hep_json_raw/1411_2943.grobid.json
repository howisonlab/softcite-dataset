            "text": "In the standard model, the B c mesons are the only states formed by two heavy quarks of different flavor, theb and the c quarks. The production of B c mesons in hadron collisions implies the simultaneous production of bb and cc pairs; therefore, it is rarer than that of other b mesons. The production of bb and cc quarkonium states in hadron collisions has been studied for two decades; however, significant puzzles remain [1]. The relative role of competing production mechanisms [2][3][4][5] is poorly understood and theory is unable to predict all experimentally observed features [6][7][8][9][10][11]. The study of B c production offers a promising way of shedding light over these discrepancies and gaining insight on the underlying physics. In protonproton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), B c mesons are expected to be mainly produced through the gluon-gluon fusion process gg \u2192 B c \u00fe b \u00fec. The production cross sections of the B c mesons have been calculated in the fragmentation approach [12,13] and in the complete order-\u03b1 4 s approach [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], where \u03b1 s is the stronginteraction coupling. In the latter approach, the total production cross section of the B c ground state B \u00fe c at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV integrated over the whole phase space and including contributions from intermediate excited states is predicted to be about 0.2% [22,23] of the inclusive bb cross section [24].",

The relative production rates of B \u00fe c and B \u00fe mesons are found to depend on their transverse momentum and rapidity. The measured transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the B \u00fe c meson are well described by the complete order-\u03b1 4 s calculation.
