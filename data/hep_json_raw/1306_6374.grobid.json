We show that a direct model-independent comparison of the data at hand contradicts this claim. Clear discrepancies with the results of Benayoun et al. (Eur. J. Phys. C 73:2453, 2013) are pointed out. As a consequence we do not believe that the lower value and the smaller uncertainty obtained for the prediction of the muon magnetic anomaly are reliable results.",
