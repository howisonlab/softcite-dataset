The invisible scenario, where the dark Higgs is lighter than the U boson and escapes detection was considered 15 . In this case, the expected signal is a muon pair from the U-boson decay plus missing energy. The analysis was performed using two data samples: one collected on the \u03c6 peak and a second one at \u221a s = 1000 MeV (off-peak sample), which is not affected by resonant backgrounds. No signal signature has been observed and a Bayesian limit on the number of signal events at 90% CL has been evaluated, bin-by-bin, for the on-peak and off-peak sample separately. In the hypothesis of \u03b1 D = \u03b1, the upper limits on the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5 ranges between 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22123 . U boson radiative production: KLOE-2 investigated both leptonic and hadronic decays of the U boson radiately produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation and decaying into: U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and U \u2192 e + e \u2212 . No significant dark photon signature has been observed and limits at 90% CL have been extracted for all processes on the number of U events. The limits on U events have been converted in limits on the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5 2 by using the formula reported in Refs. 17,18,19 . These limits are shown in Fig. 1 (KLOE (2,3,4) ). CPT violation manifests itself indirectly via Lorentz symmetry violation effects, namely the observables become dependent on the meson momentum with respect to the distant stars. The KLOE-2 results reach the sensitivity at the level of 10 \u221218 GeV 20 , which is several orders of magnitude more precise than results obtained with other neutral meson systems a . The results were obtained with the data sample corresponding to the 1.7 fb \u22121 integrated luminosity, and is mainly limited by the statistical errors.",
