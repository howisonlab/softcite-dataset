The multiplicity (N ch ) and pseudorapidity distribution (dN ch /d\u03b7) of primary charged particles in p+p collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies of \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV are obtained from extrapolation of existing measurements at lower \u221a s. These distributions are then compared to calculations from PYTHIA and PHOJET models. The existing \u221a s measurements are unable to distinguish between a logarithmic and power law dependence of the average charged particle multiplicity ( N ch ) on \u221a s, and their extrapolation to energies accessible at LHC give very different values. Assuming a reasonably good description of inclusive charged particle multiplicity distributions by Negative Binomial Distributions (NBD) at lower \u221a s to hold for LHC energies, we observe that the logarithmic \u221a s dependence of N ch are favored by the models at midrapidity. The dN ch /d\u03b7 versus \u03b7 for the existing measurements are found to be reasonably well described by a function with three parameters which accounts for the basic features of the distribution, height at midrapidity, central rapidity plateau and the higher rapidity fall-off. Extrapolation of these parameters as a function of \u221a s is used to predict the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles at LHC energies. dN ch /d\u03b7 calculations from PYTHIA and PHOJET models are found to be lower compared to those obtained from the extrapolated dN ch /d\u03b7 versus \u03b7 distributions for a broad \u03b7 range.",

Collisions at these unprecedented high energies will provide opportunities for new physics [1]. In order to fully exploit the enormous physics potential it is important to have a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism. The particle multiplicity distributions, one of the first measurements to be made at LHC, will be used to test various particle production models based on different physics mechanism and also provide constrains on model features.

            "text": "In this paper, we first make a compilation of the existing data on the average charged particle multiplicity (at midrapidity and full rapidity range) and charged particle pseudorapidity distribution as a function of \u221a s. Then we judiciously extrapolate the measurements to obtain prediction of N ch (for midrapidity and full rapidity range), charged particle multiplicity distributions and dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions at LHC energies of \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV. These results are also compared to calculations from PYTHIA [2] and PHOJET [3] monte carlo models. Energy dependence of average number of particles produced in p+p(p) collisions can be used to distinguish various models [4]. A statistical model [5] and some hydrodynamical models [6] predict a dependence of N \u223c s 1/4 , whereas multiperipheral models [7] and Feynman's scaling [8] lead to the dependence as N \u223c ln(s). Such a logarithmic dependence and on higher powers of ln(s) is also predicted by Regge-Mueller model [9]. Arguments based on simple phase space considerations [10] however predict a power law dependence as N \u223c s 1/3 . In this work we show that for the N ch data available at various \u221a s, we cannot distinguish the logarithmic and power law dependences on \u221a s. However the measurements at the LHC energies will provide a clear answer. The pseudorapidity distributions on the other hand is found to be described by a form which resembles a generalized Fermi distribution. Such distributions have been used to explain the pseudorapidity distributions of produced particles in hadronic collisions at ISR [11] and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC [12]. The compiled experimental data presented in this paper corresponds to Non Singly Diffractive (NSD) events for minimum bias triggers. The charged particle data were corrected for secondary interactions, gamma conversions, short lived decays (K 0 S , \u039b), reconstruction efficiency and acceptance effects by the experiments. To match the experimental conditions, the model simulations presented are also corrected for short lived decays. A transverse momentum (p T ) cut of greater than 100 MeV/c are usually used in realistic experimental conditions, as for example in ALICE experiment at LHC. Model simulations using PYTHIA and PHOJET suggest, a 6% \u00b1 2% effect on the charged hadron multiplicity due to a 100 MeV/c cut-off in p T at \u221a s = 10-14 TeV. The error of 2% comes from the difference in results from PYTHIA and PHOJET models. At LHC, while most of the experiments will have mid-rapidity measurements of charged particle multiplicity, ALICE experiment has the possibility to measure the distributions over -5.0 < \u03b7 < 3.5 range [1]. The CMS and ATLAS experiments will have a more limited coverage of |\u03b7| < 2.5 units [1]. The model results presented are from PYTHIA using version 6.4 (ATLAS tuned) and those from PHOJET with version 1.12 (default settings). It may be mentioned that recently a new tuned version of PYTHIA has been released [13]. The PHOJET model combines the ideas based on a dual parton model [14] on soft process of particle production and uses lowest-order perturbative QCD for hard process. Regge phenomenology is used to parameterize the total, elastic and inelastic cross-sections. The initial and final state parton shower are generated in leading log-approximation. PYTHIA on the other hand uses string fragmentation as a process of hadronization and tends to use the perturbative parton-parton scattering for low to high p T particle production. Although there are several other theoretical predictions on total cross section expected at LHC energies [15], current work focuses on how a judicious extrapolation from existing multiplicity data compares to the calculations from some of the available models [2,3].  . Multiplicity distribution for charged particles in p+p collisions at various center of mass energies at midrapidity (left panel) and full rapidity (right panel) ranges [16]. The errors are statistical. The solid lines are NBD fit to the data points using the function given in Eqn. 1.",

It is noted that extrapolation of the power law function to LHC energies seems to lead to a sudden increase in average charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity. Such a large unexpected jump in the multiplicities at midrapidity already seems to put constraints on applicability of such a functional form. As will be seen later in Fig. 4 such a functional form will lead to a probability distribution of charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity not showing the characteristic drop at higher multiplicity. Such a drop is expected from PYTHIA, PHOJET models and is seen for available experimental data shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2  We have examined the charged particle multiplicity distribution from E735 Collaboration for p+p collisions at \u221a s = 1800 GeV [18]. The multiplicity distribution is found to be well explained using the sum of two NBD functions instead of a single NBD as for the rest of the data discussed above. The sum of two NBD is given as,",

The fit to the E735 data by this function is shown in Fig. 3. The values of various parameters obtained from the fit are, N ch 1 = 36.5 \u00b1 1.7, N ch 2 = 86.9 \u00b1 2.6, k 1 = 2.8 \u00b1 0.2, k 2 = 10.3 \u00b1 0.8 and \u03c9 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.03. The overall average value of the charged particle multiplicity is 44.4. Since this data could not be fitted to a single NBD, in contrast to the data from other energies discussed in this paper, we have not included this measurement in our extrapolation studies. Further it is observed from the Fig. 2 that the two extrapolations discussed in Eqns 2 and 3 tend to differ only above \u221a s = 2000 GeV. The physics reason attributed to a different shape of multiplicity distribution at \u221a s = 1800 GeV compared to those at lower energies is due to multiple parton interactions [18]. These result are also indicative of the deviation from the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) scaling [19]. The weight factor shows the second NBD distribution dominates among the two. It will certainly be interesting to find out if this feature is more pronounced at the LHC energies.",

            "text": "This formula is chosen to describe the central plateau and the fall off in the fragmentation region of the distribution by means of the parameters \u03b7 0 and \u03b4   respectively. The term C + \u03b7, C is a fit parameter, describes the magnitude of the distribution and the dip at the \u03b7 = 0. A similar form has been used to describe the p+p data at ISR energies [11] and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC [12]. The distribution is a generalization of Fermi distribution and recent work suggests a relation of this functional form to string percolation model [21]. The values of the parameters C, \u03b7 0 and \u03b4 obtained by fitting the data distributions with Eqn. 5 are given in Table 2 and the fits to data are shown in Fig. 6 (left panel). The value of parameters C and \u03b7 0 are found to increase with increasing \u221a s. The value of the parameter \u03b4 is found to be approximately independent of \u221a s within errors. The constancy of \u03b4 is another way of demonstrating the concept of limiting fragmentation [22]. In such a scenario, multiplicity density in pseudorapidity when plotted as a function of pseudorapidity shifted by beam rapidity is expected to be independent of pseudorapidity at forward rapidities [12]. Shown in the right panel of Fig. 6 are the comparisons of the experimentally measured charged particle pseudorapidity distributions to those from the PYTHIA and the PHOJET calculations. The CDF measurements [23] are not used to obtain the parameters C, \u03b7 0 and \u03b4 for making predictions at LHC energies as discussed later, because of their very limited \u03b7 coverage. It is observed that for the lowest beam energy studied, \u221a s = 53 GeV, both PYTHIA and PHOJET are in very good agreement with the experimental data. As the beam energy increases PYTHIA results seems to be in better agreement with the data. It is observed that at both \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV, the predictions from a judicious extrapolation of existing data in general are above the model predictions. The PYTHIA results are close to the lower error band (dotted lines) for \u03b7 < 4. The values from PYTHIA are higher than those from PHOJET model calculation over a large pseudorapidity range presented. In general all the three distributions have almost similar shape. The differences between the models could arise due to several reasons. The event generation in PYTHIA is mainly designed to describe the possible hard interactions in p+p(p) collisions. It also combines sophisticated models dealing with soft hadronic interactions [2]. However in the case of PHOJET, the main approach is to describe the soft component of hadron-hadron, photon-hadron interactions at high energies. It combines the hard component calculated by perturbative QCD at the partonic level [3]. Due to the different underlying theoretical models used PYTHIA has larger model parameters which can be adjusted in order to better reproduce the data compared to PHOJET. Another difference lies in the parametrisation used get the p+p(p) crosssections. PYTHIA uses those derived from the Pomeron exchange model while the PHOJET uses the optical theorem and cross-sections are corrected for high energies using the unitarity principle.",

The extrapolation is done by fitting the variation of C with \u221a s with a functional formC = 3.7 + 1.15 ln( \u221a s) + 0.25 (ln( \u221a s)) 2(6)and the variation of \u03b7 0 with \u221a s as \u03b7 0 = 3.1 + 0.4 ln( \u221a s). (The values of C obtained are 7.63 \u00b1 0.87 and 8.43 \u00b1 1.04 for \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV respectively. Those for \u03b7 0 are 4.01 \u00b1 0.14 and 4.15 \u00b1 0.15 for \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV respectively. Assuming the functional form given in Eqn. 5 is valid for \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV and using the parameter values obtained as above, we can now predict the full pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles at \u221a s = 10 and 14 TeV. These distributions are shown in Fig. 7 along with expectations calculated from PYTHIA and PHOJET models for the same collisions. The left panel shows the results for \u221a s = 10TeV and right panel shows the results for \u221a s = 14 TeV.",
