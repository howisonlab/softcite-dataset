            "text": "The suppression of quarkonia (charmonia and bottomonia) production in high energy nuclear collisions relative to p + p collisions, due to the Debye screening of the quark-antiquark potential, was proposed as a signature of the formation of QGP [1]. However, there are other effects that may affect the observed quarkonia production. The cold nuclear matter effects, e.g. nuclear shadowing, Cronin effect, nuclear absorption, can be tested in p+A or d+A collisions. The other hot nuclear effects, such as recombination of quark-antiquark pairs might be also present. The interpretation of the quarkonia modification in QGP requires also understanding of the quarkonia production mechanism in p + p collisions. At RHIC energies the \u03a5 meson is a cleaner probe comparing to J/\u03c8 due to negligible contributions from b-b recombination and non-thermal suppression from co-mover absorption. Measurements of the quarkonia production in different colliding systems, centralities and collision energies are needed to understand those effects. In this proceedings results on J/\u03c8 production in p + p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions and \u03a5 production in p + p and Au+Au collisions via the dielectron decay channel at mid-rapidity at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV in the STAR experiment are presented.",

The new STAR result covers a broad p T region (0 < p T < 14 GeV/c). The plot also shows predictions from various J/\u03c8 production models. The Color Evaporation Model (CEM) [3] for prompt J/\u03c8 can describe the p T spectrum reasonably well. NLO Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) calculations with color-singlet (CS) and color-octet (CO) transitions [4] for prompt J/\u03c8 match the data for p T > 4 GeV/c. NNLO* CS model [5] for direct J/\u03c8 production underpredicts the data, but the prediction does not include contributions from feed-down from higher charmonium states and B-hadron decays. 1 A list of members of the STAR Collaboration and acknowledgements can be found at the end of this issue.  Different models of J/\u03c8 production are able to describe the measured J/\u03c8 production cross section reasonably well. J/\u03c8 polarization measurement can help to distinguish among the models since they predict different dependence on p T for the J/\u03c8 polarization. J/\u03c8 polarization in STAR is analyzed in the helicity frame at |y| < 1 and 2 < p T < \u223c5 GeV/c [8]. The J/\u03c8 polarization parameter \u03bb \u03b8 is extracted in three p T bins and the result is shown in Fig. 2. Within current experimental and theoretical uncertainties the obtained transverse momentum dependent \u03bb \u03b8 is consistent with the predictions from NLO + Color Singlet Model (CSM) [9] and NRQCD calculations with color octet contributions (COM) [10], and with no polarization.",

J/\u03c8 production in d+Au and Au+Au and J/\u03c8 v 2 in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV J/\u03c8 p T spectra in Au+Au collisions for different centralities for both low and high p T (0 < p T < 10 GeV/c) are shown in Fig. 3. The obtained spectra are softer at low p T than the Tsallis statistics Blast-wave (TBW) model prediction (dashed curves) which assumes that J/\u03c8 flows like light hadrons [6,7]. The data can be described by TBW fit with radial flow velocity \u03b2 fixed to zero (solid curves) [7]. This could be due to a significant contribution from charm quark recombination at low p T or small J/\u03c8 radial flow.  J/\u03c8 v 2 measurement is a crucial for testing the charm quark recombination effect. Primordial J/\u03c8 which are produced in the initial hard scattering are expected to carry very little flow, while those that are subsequently created from the recombination of thermalized (anti-)charm quarks will exhibit considerable flow. J/\u03c8 v 2 as a function of p T for semi-central (20-60%) Au+Au collisions is shown in Fig. 4 with different model predictions [15]- [20]. The STAR v 2 result is consistent with zero within the errors. It disfavors the case that J/\u03c8 is produced dominantly by coalescence from thermalized charm quarks for p T > 2 GeV/c as predicted by, e.g. model (2). Models that assume only initial production of J/\u03c8 or include both initial production and coalescence process describe the data well. Figure 5 shows J/\u03c8 R AA in d+Au collisions as a function of N coll for p T < 5 GeV/c. The data are in good agreement with a model prediction using EPS09 parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions for the shadowing and a J/\u03c8 nuclear absorption of \u03c3 abs = 3 mb [12]. The \u03c3 abs = 2.8 +3.5 \u22122.6 (stat.) +4.0 \u22122.8 (syst.) +1.8 \u22121.1 (EPS 09) mb was obtained from a fit to the data.   J/\u03c8 R AA in Au+Au collisions as a function of N Part at low and high p T [2] is shown in Fig. 6. The observed J/\u03c8 suppression increases with a collision centrality and decreases towards higher p T across the centrality range. At high p T we observe suppression only for central collisions. The results are compared to two models that include primordial J/\u03c8 production (with the color screening effect and CNM effects) and the regeneration from charm quarks [13,14]. Low-p T data agrees with both model predictions. At high p T Liu et al. model [13] describes the data reasonably well while Zhao and Rapp model [14] underpredicts the R AA for N Part > 70.",

J/\u03c8 R dAu agrees with the model using EPS09 + \u03c3 J/\u03c8 abs (3 mb). J/\u03c8 R AuAu decreases with centrality and increases with p T . At high p T suppression is only seen is central collisions. J/\u03c8 v 2 was found to be consistent with zero, it disfavors the case that J/\u03c8 is produced dominantly by coalescence of thermalized charm quarks at p T > 2 GeV/c. \u03a5(1S+2S+3S) Au+Au results are consistent with the model that predicts complete melting of 3S and a strong 2S suppression.",
