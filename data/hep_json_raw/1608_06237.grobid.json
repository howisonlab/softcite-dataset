Over such distances neutrinos have been found to oscillate among flavor states. Experiments with solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrinos have resulted in a coherent picture of neutrino masses and mixing of the three known flavor states. We will summarize the current best knowledge of neutrino parameters and phenomenology with our focus on the evolution of the experimental technique. We will proceed from the first evidence produced by astrophysical neutrino sources to the current open questions and the goals of future research.",

Pauli in 1930 (1) as an explanation of the apparent non-conservation of energy in radioactivity and inconsistencies between the exclusion principle and nuclear models of that time. Enrico Fermi was responsible for the modern name of the particle and the theory of beta decay which is the foundation for current understanding of weak interactions (2). Soon after the detection of free neutrinos from radioactive products in nuclear reactors (3,4), neutrino properties and their fundamental role in shaping the universe became an important line of inquiry (5,6).",

This hypothesis was naturally extended to mixing of neutrino flavors (11,12,13), when the neutrinos produced in pion decays from a proton accelerator were shown to be distinct from neutrinos produced in beta decays (14). Subsequently, the mixing of fields was realized to be a natural consequence of gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Both quarks and neutrinos have now been shown to experience flavor mixing although possibly originating from different mechanisms since neutrinos do not have electric charge. Whereas quarks and charged leptons are Dirac fermions with oppositely charged anti-particles, neutrinos could be either Dirac particles with a conserved leptonic charge or neutral Majorana particles with no conserved leptonic charge.",

Neutrino oscillations take place when the phases of the eigenstates (E 1 t and E 2 t) start to differ from each other as a function of time. Over a long period, even extremely small mass differences can lead to sufficient phase difference to cause flavor transformation. Observation of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos mix and at least one of them has mass. Neutrinos in the standard model of electroweak interactions are left-handed partners of the charged leptons and only participate in weak interactions. The right-handed components of the neutrino field are absent by definition making neutrinos massless in the model. Consequently, the individual lepton number is strictly conserved as confirmed in rare decays of muons, mesons, and collider experiments (20,21). Inclusion of neutrino mass in the standard model by simply introducing right-handed partners creates the difficult problem of explaining the smallness and the nature of the neutrino mass as either Dirac or Majorana. Observation of oscillations therefore is considered physics beyond the standard model that not only points to violation of separate lepton number conservation but also forces us to consider that the nature of the neutrino mass (8) could be quite different from the other fermions. On the basis of observed oscillations and limits from direct measurements, the electron neutrino mass is found to be at least five orders of magnitude smaller than the electron, the lightest of the charged fermions (22). But the existing data does not allow determination of neutrinos as Dirac or Majorana fermions. Figure 1 shows the natural and man-made sources of neutrinos that are the main contributors to our understanding of neutrino oscillations. To be sensitive to oscillations the neutrino energy and the distance to the detector need satisfy the condition \u2206m 2 L E 1 for at least one mass-squared difference. In most cases, moving the detector or the source is impractical to cover a range of L/E, and therefore a broad energy spectrum is beneficial to detect oscillations as a distortion of the expected energy distribution. For solar neutrino experiments (L 10 11 m, E 15 MeV), for atmospheric neutrino experiments (20 < L < 10000 km, E 1 GeV), for reactor neutrino experiments (L 10 \u2212 100000 m, E 3 MeV), and for accelerator neutrino experiments (L 500 km, E 1 GeV), the sensitivity ranges are \u2206m 2 10 \u221210 , 10 \u22124 , 10 \u22125 , and 10 \u22123 eV 2 , respectively. In all cases, the event rate per ton of detector is very low because of the small cross section for neutrino interactions, necessitating large detectors. The signal and background characteristics are technique dependent, nevertheless the detectors need to have very good shielding from cosmic ray muons generated in the atmosphere. This can be achieved by placing the detectors deep underground. In the case of accelerator neutrino beams, the pulsed nature of the beam provides additional background suppression.",

As products of decay chains of neutron rich nuclei, these\u03bd e are emitted isotropically from the core with an energy spectrum predominantly below 8 MeV (24,25). They are detected via the inverse beta decay (IBD) reaction,\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n, in detectors that contain free protons. The energy of an incoming antineutrino is determined by measuring the positron energy, while the detection of the recoiling neutron, in coincidence with the positron signal, suppresses backgrounds.

The dominant contributions come from the decay chains, \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 + \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) and \u00b5 \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 + \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) + \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ).

Charged-current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos enable the study of oscillations over a broad range of distances (\u223c 10 km from above to 1.3 \u00d7 10 4 km from below) in large underground detectors. The sensitivity to oscillations is greatly improved by the well-understood flux which must be up-down symmetric (within 0.5%) in the absence of oscillations (28).",

Independent confirmation came from K2K (KEK to Kamioka) (39), MINOS(Main Injector Neutrino Oscillations) (40), and T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) (41) in which disappearance of muon neutrinos was observed with a laboratory produced beam. The most precise measurements of |\u2206m 2 32 | and \u03b8 23 are currently obtained by MINOS (42) and T2K (43), respectively. Figure 3 shows the muon neutrino spectrum observed in MINOS. MINOS uses an accelerator produced beam from the Fermilab (USA) Main Injector accelerator with 120 GeV protons; the peak of the low energy neutrino beam is adjusted to be about 3 GeV. The MINOS far detector is a magnetized steel scintillator detector with 5 ktons of mass located 735 km away in the Soudan mine; in addition MINOS has a near detector using the same technology with 1 kton of mass placed \u223c1 km away from the beam production target. A unique feature of MINOS is the ability to run the beam with changes to the target position and the horn current. By fitting several different spectra in the near detector, MINOS is able to make predictions with 4% uncertainty (44) for the far detector event spectrum without oscillations which is important for parameter determination.",

Such a test requires detection of \u03c4 leptons from a charged current interaction of \u03bd \u03c4 at high energies. As the \u03c4 lepton decays almost immediately (c \u2022 \u03c4 lif etime \u223c 87 \u00b5 m), even a boosted \u03c4 with a momentum of \u223c2 GeV/c would only travel about tenth of a mm before decay. Furthermore, the \u03c4 decays to a variety of final states making it difficult to distinguish from neutral current events. Despite these difficulties Super-K collaboration has statistically identified \u03bd \u03c4 events at 3.8\u03c3 in the atmospheric neutrino data from the backgrounds generated by deep inelastic scattering of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e (47). Detection of individual \u03bd \u03c4 events requires tracking and detection of \u03c4 decays at very short distances. The direct observation of \u03bd \u03c4 appearance in a \u03bd \u00b5 beam was performed by the OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion Tracking) experiment using emulsion films with spatial resolution of \u223c 1 \u00b5m (48). OPERA has reported observation of 5 \u03c4 events with an expected background of 0.25 events confirming the dominance of the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillation mode (49,50). Starting in 1967, Ray Davis measured the solar \u03bd e flux with 610 tons of liquid C 2 Cl 4 through the reaction \u03bd e + 37 Cl\u2192 e \u2212 + 37 Ar (52). The solar neutrino rate was determined by periodically counting decays of radioactive 37 Ar extracted from the detector liquid. The measured \u03bd e flux was only about 1/3 (53) of the prediction from the standard solar model (SSM) (54). This result was further confirmed by the Gallium experiments, SAGE (55) and GALLEX (56), using the \u03bd e + 71 Ga\u2192 71 Ge+e \u2212 reaction as well as Kamiokande (57) and Super-K (58, 59) experiments using the \u03bd e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bd e + e \u2212 reaction. Neutrino mixing offered a natural explanation to the solar neutrino puzzle, since some of the \u03bd e generated in the Sun could transform to muon or tau neutrino flavors during flight and thus become undetectable due to the low solar neutrino energies which are below the thresholds for muon and tau production. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment was designed to measure the flux of all neutrino flavors from the Sun using the neutral current reaction on deuterium, \u03bd + d \u2192 \u03bd + p + n, and separately the \u03bd e flux through the chargedcurrent reaction \u03bd e + d \u2192 e \u2212 + p + p. SNO was a water Cherenkov detector with an active target mass composed of \u223c 1 kton of heavy water (D 2 O) which provides the deuterium targets for solar neutrinos. The final-state neutron from the neutral-current reaction was detected by a variety of techniques with consistent results. Measurement of the electron energy from the final state of the charged current reaction determines the solar neutrino spectrum above \u223c 5 MeV (60). The results (61) are consistent with the predictions of SSM incorporating \u03bd-oscillations enhanced by the matter effect in the Sun. Borexino in Italy is an extremely high resolution liquid scintillation underground detector and has contributed by measuring the elastic scattering reaction, \u03bd + e \u2192 \u03bd + e, for \u03bd e energies below the 7 Be line (0.861 MeV) in the solar neutrino spectrum. The solar \u03bd e survival probability as function of energy is obtained by combining data collected at all energies by the radiochemical experiments(based on chlorine and gallium), Borexino, SNO, and Super-K (62).",

            "text": "In 2012, three new reactor experiments reported results on \u03b8 13 . Double Chooz (France) reported results with a far detector only (73) disfavoring \u03b8 13 = 0 at 1.6\u03c3. The Daya Bay experiment (China) reported the discovery of non-zero \u03b8 13 with 5\u03c3 significance from an array of three near, and three far identical detectors (each with 20 tons of gadolium-loaded liquid scintillator fiducial mass) placed to optimize sensitivity from three nuclear power stations (74). RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillations) also reported results from an array of nuclear power stations in Korea and identical near and far Gd-loaded liquid scintillator detectors confirming Daya Bay's discovery with a 4.9\u03c3 significance (75). Daya Bay increased their significance to >10\u03c3 with a larger data set (76) and recently added more target mass to the far and near sites (4 near and 4 far detectors) (77). The additional statistics and careful energy calibration in Daya Bay has resulted in an independent measurement of \u2206m 2 31 which governs this oscillation (Fig. 5). The third neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 is now precisely measured to be \u223c8.4 \u2022 . MI-NOS (78) and T2K (79) have reported their searches of \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e oscillation that is also sensitive to \u03b8 13 . In particular, T2K obtained an early result disfavoring \u03b8 13 = 0 at 2.5\u03c3. The status of current accelerator experiments addressing \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e will be covered in more detail in the next section. The picture of masses and mixings illustrated in Fig. 2 was assembled over several decades, mainly using precise observations of \u03bd \u00b5 or \u03bd e disappearance. By convention m 2 > m 1 , and the strong evidence of matter effect in the Sun indicates \u2206m 2 21 cos 2\u03b8 12 > 0 leading to \u03b8 12 < \u03c0/4 (7). But the question of neutrino mass hierarchy, whether \u03bd 3 is heavier or lighter than \u03bd 1,2 , remains unresolved (80). The sign of \u03b8 23 \u2212 \u03c0/4 and the Dirac or Majorana phases are also unknown. These questions as well as further precision measurements are expected to be addressed by running and future experiments optimized for the known parameters and focused on appearance measurements of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e conversion.

Recent studies in leptogenesis (87) have shown that the phases in the PMNS matrix can provide the CP violation large enough for the generation of observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (88,89). Therefore observation of CP violation due to J P M N S CP could account for a large fraction of the baryon asymmetry (90,91). The asymmetry A \u00b5e CP increases as a function of L/E and is shown to decrease with sin \u03b8 13 (92,93) as long as it is not too small, and with current parameters the asymmetry can be as large as \u223c 32% for L/E \u223c 500 km/GeV (94). Due to the linear dependence on L, and sin \u03b8 13 , the statistical error on A \u00b5e CP is approximately independent of L and \u03b8 13 providing substantial flexibility in experimental considerations (92,95).",

The effect for neutrinos (anti-neutrinos) leads to an enhancement (suppression) for m 3 > m 2 > m 1 and a suppression (enhancement) for m 1 < m 2 < m 3 , and therefore measuring it will determine the order of the neutrino masses. Atmospheric neutrinos are also expected to show significant sensitivity to Earth matter for E \u03bd > 2 GeV crossing the core (96,97). The effect of Earth matter on neutrino oscillations with accelerator or atmospheric neutrinos has not been demonstrated in a definitive way, therefore such a measurement has interest both for phenomenology and for determining the mass ordering.",

The measured reactor neutrino energy spectrum for \u2206m 2 21 L/(2E) \u223c 1 (or L \u223c 50km) is expected to exhibit oscillations with a slow (\u2206 21 ) and a fast component. The fast component arising from the \u2206 31 and \u2206 32 terms has amplitude proportional to sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ). The two choices for mass hierarchy produce a small energy dependent shift (of the order of \u2206m 2 21 /\u2206m 2 32 \u223c \u00b13%) in the oscillation pattern which can be measured with sufficient energy resolution. From above formula, well-optimized reactor experiments can access five neutrino mixing parameters: \u03b8 12 , \u2206m 2 21 , \u03b8 13 , |\u2206m 2 32 |, and the mass hierarchy (or the sign of \u2206m 2 32 ). Such high precision measurements will enable tests of neutrino mass and mixing models. For example, models of quark-lepton complementarity and others (114,115), have predicted \u03b8 12 + \u03b8 Cabbibo = \u03c0/2 and \u03b8 13 \u2248 \u03b8 Cabbibo / \u221a 2.",

These experiments were both optimized before the discovery of \u03b8 13 to obtain evidence for this transition with the best signal to background ratio. The two principal backgrounds to an electron neutrino event in the few GeV range are: the intrinsic \u03bd e contamination present in the acceleratorproduced beam at \u223c 1% level, and weak neutral current \u03bd interactions that produce photons and \u03c0 0 particles. The \u03bd e background in the beam comes from \u00b5 and K-meson decays in the decay tunnel. The \u03bd e background is indistinguishable from the signal except that it has a broader energy spectrum. The neutral current processes produce photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays that could be misidentified as single electrons in case of asymmetric or overlapping electro-magnetic showers. To limit the impact of both of these backgrounds with broad energy spectra, both T2K and NO\u03bdA have adapted the strategy of using a narrow neutrino energy spectrum. The narrow energy spectrum cuts down the contributions from neutrinos outside of the energies of interest as set by the oscillation probability. The narrow-band beam is achieved with the off-axis neutrino beam technique (45) in which the detector is placed at a small angle to the beam to exploit the kinematic momentum peak in the 2-body \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 decay. The T2K and NO\u03bdA experiments utilize neutrino beams with a peak energy of \u223c0.6 GeV and \u223c2 GeV, at off-axis angles of 44 and 14 mrad, respectively.",

ORCA is proposed as a deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean as part of KM3NeT (multi-km 3 neutrino telescope). INO is a planned to be an underground magnetized iron calorimeter with \u223c 50 kton mass and 1.5 Tesla magnetic field in southern India. Hyper-Kamiokande (131) is a proposed giant water Cherenkov detector near the site of the current Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan. These experiments are expected to be limited by systematics because of the energy and angular resolution needed. Their capability to distinguish between the two mass hierarchies, which is correlated to \u03b8 23 , can reach above 3\u03c3 independent of the CP phase given enough exposure. As remarked in Sec. 4, there is a large ambiguity between the CP phase and the mass hierarchy in current accelerator based experiments. This can be further reduced by combining with atmospheric neutrino data (132).",

The fast oscillations due to the last two terms in Eq. 14(\u2206 31 and \u2206 32 ) will exhibit the shift at any distance, however at short distances (defined by \u2206 21 \u03c0/2), the shift is ambiguous with the measurement of \u2206m 2 31 itself, and at long distances (\u2206 21 \u03c0/2) the oscillations are too fast to be observable with achievable energy resolution.

For \u2206 21 < \u03c0/2, the nodes of P\u0113\u0113 oscillations are shifted to lower (higher) energies for normal (inverted) hierarchy, but for \u2206 21 > \u03c0/2, the converse is true. This phenomenology allows us to choose L so that the \u2206 21 = \u03c0/2 node is around \u223c 3 MeV or the maximum of the reactor spectrum to avoid ambiguities (110). This node can be shown to be at L = 2\u03c0E/\u2206m 2 21 \u2248 50 km. The oscillations on either side of the node at \u223c 3 MeV can be compared in a single detector to resolve for IH versus NH, reducing dependence on the absolute energy calibration (Fig. 8). Nevertheless, the detector must have sufficient statistics (\u223c 10 5 events after oscillations), energy resolution( 3% at 1 MeV), and linearity ( 1%) across the reactor energy range. Otherwise, low-energy oscillation pattern will be smeared out. The detector also must be equidistant from all reactor cores so that the oscillation pattern is not obscured. The large event sample from such an arrangement would also enable precision (\u223c 1%) measurements of sin 2 2\u03b8 12 , \u2206m 2 21 , and \u2206m 2 32 . There are two proposed next generation reactor experiments: the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) (135,136) in China and RENO-50 (137) in South Korea. JUNO (RENO-50) design calls for a 20 kton (18 kton) fiducial mass liquid scintillator detector placed 700 m (900 m) underground, 52.5 km (47 km) away from a set of reactors with total thermal power of \u223c 36 GW (\u223c 16 GW). At about 50 km, the IBD rate is \u223c 0.1(0.3) day \u22121 kton \u22121 GW \u22121 with (without) oscillations indicating a need for \u223c3000 kton\u2022GW\u2022year of exposure. The needed energy resolution and linearity lead to requirements on the scintillator brightness, attenuation length, photo-detector coverage, and quantum efficiency so that the photo-electron yield is 1000 per MeV. With the required energy resolution JUNO will achieve > 3\u03c3 separation of the two mass hierarchies with \u223c6 years of operation(136).",

At the first oscillation maximum, \u2206 31 \u223c = \u2206 32 = \u03c0/2, the asymmetry due to matter effect exceeds the maximum from CP violation at E \u03bd \u223c 2.3 GeV or \u223c 1200 km (94,141). Therefore, two different strategies for experimental optimization exist: distances of 500 km would allow measurement of CP violation with low dependence on MH, while distances of 1200 km would allow resolution of MH and also be sensitive to CP violation. A minimum distance is determined from the requirement that E \u03bd 0.5 GeV, a condition that ensures high enough probability for \u03bd and \u03bd interactions and good particle reconstruction and identification. An additional consideration is to obtain events at the second oscillation maximum, \u2206 32 = 3\u03c0/2 where CP effects are a factor of 3 larger, but event rate is one-ninth as large due to kinematics.

            "text": "The Hyper-K and DUNE experiments require precise prediction of \u03bd e signal and background spectra in the far detector. The prediction is calculated by extrapolating the measured event spectrum from the near detector, using the known beam geometry and constraints on the cross sections, and near and far detector efficiencies. The systematic errors associated with neutrino nucleus cross sections require further measurements and modeling (151). Since the maximum expected asymmetry from CP violation is 32%, the requirement on the allowed systematic error is less than a few percent so that a 5\u03c3 effect can be measured with O(1000) events. A joint fit to the four spectra -\u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e ,\u03bd e -is expected to cancel some uncertainties, and the remaining largest contribution is expected to come from the relative energy scale for \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 events (152). For DUNE, if the matter and CP asymmetries have the same sign, the combined effect is very large and the mass hierarchy will be determined to > 5\u03c3 within a few months of running; in case of the opposite, exposure of a few years is needed (145). Figure 10 shows the current global fit for \u03b4 CP versus sin 2 2\u03b8 13 while marginalizing over all other oscillation parameters (30,31) including the reactor constraint on \u03b8 13 . The figure also shows the expectation at \u03b4 CP = 0 and \u00b1\u03c0/2 for Hyper-K (DUNE) assuming 10 yrs of exposure at 1.3 MW (1.2 MW) (153,146). Note that the Hyper-K and DUNE expectations do not include the \u03b8 13 constraint. The independent measurements of \u03b8 13 from accelerators and reactors can be compared to test for new physics (86).  Figure 9: P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) plotted as a function of energy for 1300 km and 295 km with the neutrino spectrum designed for DUNE (left) and Hyper-K (right) in arbitrary units. The probability for antineutrinos will be modified approximately by \u03b4 CP \u2192 \u2212\u03b4 CP and NH\u2192IH. The antineutrino spectrum shape is approximately the same.  Figure 10: Current measurements and future goals in the \u03b4 CP and sin 2 2\u03b8 13 plane. The current best fit in yellow (cyan) for 1\u03c3 (3\u03c3) C.L. is from a combination of T2K and reactor measurements (30). Brown vertical band shows the future reactor measurement dominated by Daya Bay. The blue-gray (maroon) contours show measurements that could result from DUNE (Hyper-K) at \u03b4 CP values of \u00b190 \u2022 and 0 \u2022 . The Hyper-K and DUNE projections are taken from Ref. (153) and Ref. (146), respectively. Hyper-K and DUNE do not have identical treatment of the correlation to \u03b8 23 . For Hyper-K the mass hierarchy is assumed to be known; for DUNE the measurement can be done with the same data.",

The picture of 3-flavor oscillations has now been established by observation of neutrino oscillations with solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrinos. Remarkably, a consistent picture of mass differences and mixing has emerged so that extremely precise experiments, using well-characterized and controlled terrestrial sources of neutrinos using reactors and accelerators, are now feasible. The main objectives of such an experimental program are the determination of potentially large CP violation in the neutrino sector, resolution of the mass ordering, and measurement of the mixing parameters with greater precision. The precision and redundancy of measurements will allow constraints on new physics beyond the 3-flavor model as well as neutrino mass and mixing models.",
