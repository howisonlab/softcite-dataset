Measurements in small collision systems provide a necessary baseline for heavy-ion data, help to tune pQCD inspired event generators and give insight into the search for the onset of collective effects. As the \u03c6 meson has a longer lifetime compared to other resonances, it is expected that its production would be much less affected by regeneration and re-scattering processes. We report on measurements of \u03c6 meson production in minimum bias pp collisions at different beam energies and as a function of charged particle multiplicity with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The results include the transverse momentum (p T ) distributions of \u03c6 as well as the particle yield ratios. Finally, we have also studied the \u03c6 effective strangeness content by comparing our results to theoretical calculations.",

            "text": "Resonances are important tools to probe the hadronic phase formed in heavy-ion collisions due to their short lifetimes. \u03c6 is a hidden strange vector meson, whose mass is similar to that of proton and \u039b. The lifetime of \u03c6 (46.3 fm/c) is longer compared to other hadronic resonances as well as the fireball produced in heavy-ion collisions. Thus it is expected that \u03c6 meson may not go through the re-generation and re-scattering processes [1] occurring during the hadronic phase. Being the \u03c6 formed by an ss quark pair with zero netstrangeness content, measurements of \u03c6 meson production can help seeding light on strangeness production mechanisms. Furthermore, the study of \u03c6 in pp collisions helps to search for the onset of collectivity in small systems and provide a necessary baseline for heavy-ion collisions.",

            "text": "This article focuses on the study of the energy and charged particle multiplicity dependence across different colliding systems of \u03c6 production, by comparing results obtained in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 [2], 5.02, 7 [3], 8 and 13 TeV at the LHC. In particular, p T spectra at different energies as well as p T -integrated particle ratios to long-lived hadrons are compared. In this paper, we aim to address the following three questions: is there any dependence of \u03c6 production in pp collision on collisions energy or on charged particle multiplicity, do re-scattering and regeneration processes affect the production of the long-lived \u03c6 in high multiplicity pp collisions and, finally, how does the effective strangeness content play a role in strangeness production mechanism?",

            "text": "The \u03c6(1020) is reconstructed through an invariant mass analysis at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5) of its hadronic decay channel [2,3] i.e. K + K \u2212 (Branching ratio: 48.9%) [4] using Inner Tracking System (ITS), Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time of Flight (TOF) detector of ALICE. The yields of \u03c6(1020) in different p T intervals are obtained by subtracting the combinatorial background from the unlike-sign charged particle invariant mass distribution. The event mixing and like-sign techniques are used to estimate the combinatorial background. After combinatorial background subtraction a residual background remains which arises mainly due to mis-identified particle decay products or from other sources of correlated pairs (e.g. mini-jets). The \u03c6(1020) peak is fitted with a Voigtian function, which is a convolution of Breit-Wigner and Gaussian functions [2,3]. For the cases when the combinatorial background shows large statistical fluctuation, the \u03c6 peak is fitted without any combinatorial background subtraction. In different p T intervals, raw yields are obtained from the residual background subtracted signal distributions. The raw yields are then corrected for the detector efficiency \u00d7 acceptance and the branching ratios to determine the final p T spectrum. The estimation of charged particle multiplicity classes is performed using V0 detector.   Figure 1 shows the \u03c6 normalised (dN/dy)/ dN ch /d\u03b7 value as a function of average charged particle multiplicity in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 and 13 TeV. It remains flat and independent of collision energy, which suggests that the event multiplicity drives the particle production, irrespective of collision energy. The top left panel of Figure 2 shows the ratio of \u03c6 and K * 0 to kaons as a function of the charged particle multiplicity. As the lifetime of K * 0 is 10 times shorter compared to \u03c6, it is expected that K * 0 would be affected by the re-generation and re-scattering processes. A decreasing trend of K * 0 /K ratio is observed, which suggests the re-scattering dominates over regeneration process. As expected, the \u03c6/K ratio remains fairly flat indicating thus either the regeneration and re-scattering are balanced or, given its longer lifetime, \u03c6 decays after the hadronic phase and is not affected by re-scattering and regeneration. The top right and bottom panels of Figure 2 show \u03c6/\u03c0 and \u039e/\u03c6 ratios as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 respectively. In the \u03c6/\u03c0 ratio, the production of \u03c6 in large systems (Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions) is well described by a grand-canonical thermal model (GSI-Heidelberg) [5], while for small systems (pp and p-Pb collisions) the increase of the \u03c6/\u03c0 ratio with multiplicity is in contrast to the expectation from strangeness canonical suppression (not shown) [6]. This behavior favors the non-equilibrium production of \u03c6 and/or strange particles. The \u03c6/K and \u039e/\u03c6 ratios remain fairly flat across a wide multiplicity range. Comparing the \u03c6 with particles with strange quark content =1 (K) or =2 (\u039e) we observe that the \u03c6 behaves similarly to particles with open strangeness. In addition, there is a multiplicity dependence for the \u039e/\u03c6 ratio observed, particularly at low multiplicities. ",
