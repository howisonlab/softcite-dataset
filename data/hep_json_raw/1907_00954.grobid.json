The significance of the observed signal is in excess of seven standard deviations. It is found that (58 \u00b1 15)% of the decays proceed via the two-body intermediate state \u03c7 c1 (3872)\u039b(1520).

This discovery has attracted much interest in exotic charmonium spectroscopy since it was the first observation of an unexpected charmonium candidate. The mass of the \u03c7 c1 (3872) state has been precisely measured [5,8] and the dipion mass spectrum in the decay \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was also studied [1,6,9]. The quantum numbers of the state were determined to be J PC = 1 ++ from measurements performed by the LHCb collaboration [10].",

It has been interpreted as a \u03c7 c1 (2P) charmonium state [13,14], molecular state [15][16][17], tetraquark [18,19], ccg hybrid meson [20], vector glueball [21] or mixed state [22,23]. Studies of radiative \u03c7 c1 (3872) decays [24][25][26] have reduced the number of possible interpretations of this state [27][28][29]. Thus far, the \u03c7 c1 (3872) particle has been widely studied in prompt hadroproduction [2,[5][6][7] and in the weak decays of beauty mesons. Several decays of the \u039b 0 b baryon to charmonium have been observed [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. Observing \u039b 0 b decays involving the \u03c7 c1 (3872) state will allow comparison of their decay rates to the rates for conventional charmonium states, where, for instance, factorisation and spectator quarks assumptions may lead to different results depending on the nature of the \u03c7 c1 (3872) state.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [40], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [41,42] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [43]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [44]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [45], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a pair of opposite-sign muons with a requirement on the product of muon transverse momenta, or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires two muons of opposite charge forming a good-quality secondary vertex with a mass in excess of 2.7 GeV/c 2 , or a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with at least one charged particle with a large p T and inconsistent with originating from any PV. For both cases significant displacement of the secondary vertex from any primary pp interaction vertex is required.",

The simulated decays of \u039b 0 b baryons are produced according to a phase-space decay model. The \u03c7 c1 (3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay proceeds via the J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 S-wave intermediate state [10]. The simulated \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)pK \u2212 decays are corrected to reproduce the pK \u2212 mass and cos \u03b8 pK \u2212 distributions observed in data, where the helicity angle of the pK \u2212 system, \u03b8 pK \u2212 , is defined as the angle between the momentum vectors of the kaon and \u039b 0 b baryon in the pK \u2212 rest frame. To account for imperfections in the simulation of charged particle reconstruction, efficiency corrections obtained using data are also applied [58].",

This is studied by varying the selection criteria in ranges that lead to as much as \u00b120% change in the measured signal yields. The stability is tested by comparing the efficiency-corrected yields within these variations. The resulting variations in the efficiency-corrected yields do not exceed 1%, which is taken as a corresponding systematic uncertainty [36].
