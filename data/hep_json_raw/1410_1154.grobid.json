            "text": "A measurement of the W boson helicity is presented, where the W boson originates from the decay of a top quark produced in pp collisions. The event selection, optimized for reconstructing a single top quark in the final state, requires exactly one isolated lepton (muon or electron) and exactly two jets, one of which is likely to originate from the hadronization of a bottom quark. The analysis is performed using data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2012. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The measured helicity fractions are F L = 0.298 \u00b1 0.028 (stat) \u00b1 0.032(syst), F 0 = 0.720 \u00b1 0.039 (stat) \u00b1 0.037(syst), and F R = \u22120.018 \u00b1 0.019 (stat) \u00b1 0.011(syst). These results are used to set limits on the real part of the tWb anomalous couplings, g L and g R .",

At the CERN LHC [3], top quarks are produced in pairs through the strong interaction and individually through electroweak processes including the tWb vertex. The production of single top quarks has been observed both at the Tevatron [4,5] and at the LHC [6,7]. The t-channel process is the dominant electroweak single top quark production mechanism at the LHC. The other two processes, W-associated (tW) and s-channel, amount to \u224820% of the cross section [8].",

Hence, the W boson helicity fractions defined as F i = \u0393 i / \u0393, where i = L, 0, or R, fulfill the condition of F i = 1. The SM predictions for the W boson helicity fractions at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant, including the finite b quark mass and electroweak effects, are F L = 0.311 \u00b1 0.005, F 0 = 0.687 \u00b1 0.005, and F R = 0.0017 \u00b1 0.0001 [10] for a bottom quark mass m b = 4.8 GeV and a top quark mass m t = 172.8 \u00b1 1.3 GeV.

The single top quark topology here refers to a final state of exactly one lepton ( = e or \u00b5) and exactly two jets, one of which is associated to a b quark. While the event selection requires a single top quark to be reconstructed in the final state, a significant contribution is expected from tt events with one top quark decaying leptonically. The tt events carry the same physics information on the tWb vertex in the top quark decay as single top quark events. The selected tt event sample in this analysis do not overlap with the one obtained from the standard CMS tt event selection. Inclusion of tt events in the signal sample provides a larger event sample and results in smaller uncertainties in the measurement.",

The isolation variable I rel is calculated by summing the transverse energy deposited by other particles in a cone of size \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the muon, divided by the muon p T .

The electron is selected if the isolation variable, defined similarly to that of muons but with a cone size of 0.3, is less than 0.1. Events with additional leptons, passing less restrictive kinematic and qualification criteria, are rejected. Details on the prompt muon and electron isolation and identification, as well as the criteria to veto additional muons and electrons, can be found in [26].

The tt events with the \u00b5(e)+\u03c4 decay mode, where the \u03c4 -lepton decays hadronically, contribute about 16% of the selected events. The remaining 14% is mainly attributed to the dileptonic final states with muons and electrons, where one of the leptons has failed the veto criteria. The tt events in the current sample are rejected by the standard lepton+jets tt selection because of the required number of jets and the b-jet multiplicity.

The distribution of reconstructed cos \u03b8 * in data is compared with simulation in figure 1 (bottom). The difference between the muon and electron decay channels is due to different lepton p T requirements and the different contributions of the QCD multijet background. Lower - cos \u03b8 * values are removed with a harder requirement on the lepton p T . These distributions are used as input to the likelihood fit method to measure the W boson helicity fractions.",

We determine the normalization of the W+jets event sample together with the W boson helicity fractions in the fit in order to reduce the related systematic uncertainties. The shape for the W+jets background is taken from simulation. The shape and the normalization of the QCD multijet background are obtained from an independent measurement [26]. The shape is obtained from a QCD-enriched event sample, constructed by applying to data the selection mentioned in section 4, but with the lepton isolation requirement reversed, i.e. I rel > 0.12 and I rel > 0.1 for the muon and electron, respectively. The normalization is extracted from a fit to the m W T distribution in the signal region. The normalizations for other backgrounds, namely Z+jets and dibosons, are taken from the single top quark cross section measurement [26] where their shapes are derived from simulation.",
