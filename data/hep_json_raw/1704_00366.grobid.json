            "text": "Production of three-boson final states in proton-proton collisions is predicted by the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge structure of the standard model (SM). Cross sections for these processes include contributions from quartic gauge couplings (QGCs), which are sensitive to new phenomena that modify those couplings. In this paper, we present cross section measurements for the pp \u2192 W\u03b3\u03b3 and pp \u2192 Z\u03b3\u03b3 processes and a search for anomalous QGCs (aQGCs). The W \u2192 \u03bd and Z \u2192 decay modes are selected for analysis, where is a muon or an electron. The cross sections are measured in fiducial regions that are defined by selection criteria similar to those used to select signal events. In particular, to avoid infrared divergences, minimum photon transverse momenta p T of 25 and 15 GeV are required in the W\u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 measurements, respectively. A dimension-8 effective field theory is used to model aQGCs, which would enhance W\u03b3\u03b3 production at high momentum scales. The W\u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 processes were recently observed by the ATLAS Collaboration [1,2] using 20.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Cross sections for W\u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 production have also been computed with QCD corrections up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in refs. [3,4].",

In the electron channel, additional criteria are imposed to reject background events arising from Z boson decays to electrons in which only one electron is correctly identified, the other is misidentified as a photon, and an additional prompt photon is present in the event. Both photons are required to pass an electron veto that rejects photons that match to tracks in the pixel detector. This requirement decreases the signal efficiency by removing converted photons, which are commonly matched to tracks in the pixel detector. However, the background contamination from electrons is further decreased by a factor of two.

The isolation I ch is defined as the scalar p T sum of charged hadron PF candidates having \u2206R < 0.3 with respect to the photon candidate. Charged hadron PF candidates are required to have energy deposits in the HCAL and originate from the primary vertex, defined as the vertex with the highest sum of squared transverse momenta of its associated tracks [24]. Prompt photons have low values of I ch while jets that are misidentified as photons tend to have larger values. The distribution of I ch,1 versus I ch,2 (a \"template\") is determined for each of the four sources of diphoton candidates: prompt-prompt (PP), prompt-jet (PJ), jet-prompt (JP), and jet-jet (JJ). The PP template represents the signal, while the PJ and JP templates represent background events having one prompt photon, and the JJ template represents background events having no prompt photons. Each template consists of four bins. The distribution of I ch is divided into a \"tight\" region and a \"loose\" control region for each of the two photons. The tight region contains photon candidates that satisfy the nominal I ch criterion, while the loose region contains photon candidates that fail the nominal, but pass a less stringent requirement. The value of the less stringent requirement is chosen such that candidates in the loose region are enriched in photon-like jets that are independent of, but sufficiently similar to those that contaminate the signal region. The four-bin structure of the templates provides discrimination between prompt photons and jets and allows for a straightforward matrix equation solution, taking account of correlations between I ch,1 and I ch,2 . The contribution of each source is determined from control data samples. Three control data samples are formed from the combinations of the tight and loose regions: tight-loose (TL) and loosetight (LT), where one photon passes the requirement and the other fails, and loose-loose (LL), where both photons fail the requirement. The signal region is labeled tight-tight (TT). The TL and LT regions are treated separately to take into account differences in photon p T and differences between photons that are reconstructed in the barrel and endcaps. The normalizations of the four sources of photon candidates are determined through the matrix equation ",

The JJ templates are therefore determined from a sample of JHEP10(2017)072 candidate diphoton events in data that is independent of the signal region. For this selection, the requirement on the ECAL transverse shower shape is inverted and the PF photon isolation requirement is relaxed. This procedure can result in a bias through correlations between the ECAL shower shape and the isolation. The systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the maximum value of the relaxed requirements on the PF photon isolation. The largest deviation is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty, which is approximately 10%.

The misidentification ratio is determined as a function of p T and \u03b7 in a control sample of data enriched in single Z boson events that have one reconstructed electron and one photon.

The uncertainties related to the renormalization and factorization scales are evaluated by varying them independently by factors of 0.5 and 2. The largest variation is applied as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty in the pileup distribution is evaluated by varying the assumed minimum-bias cross section by \u00b15%. Uncertainties in the selection efficiencies of electrons, muons, and photons and in the trigger requirements are derived from uncertainties in the tag-and-probe analyses. Estimates of the energy scale uncertainty for the electron, photon, and muon are made from comparisons of the Z boson line shape between data and simulation. Uncertainties in the p miss T energy scale are estimated by propagating the energy scale uncertainty for each object used in the p miss T calculation.
