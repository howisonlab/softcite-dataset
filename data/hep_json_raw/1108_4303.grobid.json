The interest in such final states is motivated by a summary of some of the relevant literature. We also show first results from the analysis of diffractively produced KK\u03c0 states. Two prominent three-body structures, one around 1.8 GeV, the other at 2.2 GeV decaying via known KK and K\u03c0 states are seen.",

Specific aims are the confirmation or rejection of hybrid or glueball states. The literature on both is vast. At the time of this writing, the SPIRES database finds 782 papers with \"glueball\" in their title. Out of these, 6 also have \"evidence\" in their title. But only two of these papers have been cited more than 5 times: one is a lattice calculation [2], the other [3] was followed by a paper by the same authors [4] phrasing their result as a question. Likewise a database search finds 200 papers on mesons with \"hybrid\" in their title. Yet, there's not a single one whose title contains \"evidence\" or \"confirm.\" In other words, clarification and further experimental input are direly needed.",

The forward-flying particles produced in the central or diffractive interaction were measured and identified by means of a twostage spectrometer which features highly efficient track reconstruction from approximately 1 GeV upwards combined with particle identification in the wide-angle spectrometer and both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry in both stages of the spectrometer. Together, these components yield nearly 4\u03c0 coverage of the neutral and charged particles of the forward flying system. Further, in order to identify events where the target proton remained intact, a recoil proton detector was used which detected the slow proton emitted at large angles. At the same time a veto system ensured the absence of other slow particles between the recoil proton detector and the spectrometer acceptance, thought mostly due to inelastic excitations of the target.",

This angle is a function of the velocity \u03b2 of the particles. Since track reconstruction in magnetic spectrometers measures the momentum p of the particles, their mass m can be recovered via p/m = \u03b2 /(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 ) 1/2 . In our current analysis we use this to identify charged kaons between 10 GeV and 30 GeV. Figure 1a serves to illustrate the performance of the RICH detector. short-lived neutral kaons identify themselves through their displaced decay V 0 vertex which gives the right mass if a pion hypothesis is made for its outgoing oppositely charged particles. Given the known [5] mean lifetime \u03c4 = 0.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 s and the neutral kaon mass m(K 0 S ) = 497 MeV, this displacement can take     [12]. Note the much suppressed K * K branching for a strictly hybrid \u03c0(1800) compared to the case of a radial excitation. the order of a few meters at COMPASS energies. The most important background to the K 0 S s are \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 decays. Their contribution was verified to be negligible. Reconstructed K 0 S -masses are shown in fig. 1b. Note that the exclusive sample used in the analysis has very little background. finally, the beam carries a fraction of kaons (O(5%)). These are excluded by means of specifically designed Cherenkov detectors [6] which were placed in the beamline.",

Preferential K * (\u2192 K\u03c0)K decay is expected from models of quartet and hybrid states [9,10]. So far no kaonic exotics emerged from various experimentally studied production processes [11]. Since their existence is inevitable in flavor multiplet schemes, they can be considered touchstones of quartet models. COMPASS produced KK\u03c0 \u2212 with high statistics, well suited for partial wave analysis. In addition to exotics, states or dublets with qq quantum numbers like the enigmatic E/\u03b9(1405) or \u03c0(1800) will possibly make an appearance in these data. The question whether the \u03c0(1800) is a radial excitation of the pion or a hybrid state or a combination of both, perhaps even two different nearby states, has been raised. Theoretical calculations of branching ratios in the different scenarios [12], quoted in table 1, have provided a reference frame for experiments to distinguish between the various possibilities. Results in this direction were given by VES [13] and E852 [14].",

One sees that momentum conservation by itself ensures a very clean selection owing to the purity of the COMPASS trigger system and the efficient track reconstruction. The coplanarity angle referenced is defined as the angle between the plane spanned by the beam direction and the momentum vector of the KK\u03c0 system on the one hand, and the plane spanned by the beam direction and the recoiling proton on the other.

            "text": "The presence of different production regimes is apparent in the neutral kaon data. Figure 3 illustrates this in two ways. The distribution of rapidities ( fig. 3a) shows large overlap between the pion and kaon rapidities, but also a significant fraction where the pion rapidity exceeds that of the kaons. Diffractive production is characterized by the absence of a rapidity gap between the decay products of the diffractively excited resonance. For the partial wave analysis we selected a subset without an apparent rapidity gap. The division into different production processes is corroborated by fig. 3b which shows the KK mass distribution over the    momentum of the pion. For high pion momenta, the KK mass spectrum develops detailed structure whereas for lower pion momenta the KK mass spectrum appears to be dominated by the available phase space. Figure 4 gives a detailed view of the mass spectra in the overall sample and how they relate. The first striking feature concerns the K\u03c0 spectra (top row). There are very strong bands corresponding to the K * (892) and the excited kaons (which we shall indiscriminately refer to as K(1430) in what follows) around 1430 MeV. There are two predominant structures in terms of the three-body mass: one at approximately 1800 MeV, one around 2.2 GeV. The lower two plots, which allow the same kind of quantitative analysis for KK intermediate states, show two strong diagonal bands which are reflections of the K * (892) and K(1430). Besides these, one sees the f (980) / a(980) near the threshold and a well defined band near m(KK) = 1500 MeV which probably corresponds to the f 2 (1525). Again the clustering near m(KK\u03c0) = 1800 MeV and = 2.2 GeV is apparent. The difference in structure between the charged and the neutral case is significantly reduced if one reproduces the low-momentum cut needed for the charged kaons in the neutral case.",
