The long baseline, typically 180 km, enables KamLAND to address the oscillation solution of the \"solar neutrino problem\" with\u03bd e 's under laboratory conditions. KamLAND found fewer reactor\u03bd e events than expected from standard assumptions about \u03bd e propagation at more than 9\u03c3 confidence level (C.L.). The observed energy spectrum disagrees with the expected spectral shape at more than 5\u03c3 C.L., and prefers the distortion from neutrino oscillation effects. A three-flavor oscillation analysis of the data from KamLAND and KamLAND + solar neutrino experiments with CPT invariance, yields m 2 21 = [7.54 +0.19 \u22120.18 \u00d710 \u22125 eV 2 , 7.53 +0.19   \u22120.18 \u00d710 \u22125 eV 2 ], tan 2 \u03b8 12 = [0.481 +0.092 \u22120.080 , 0.437 +0.029 \u22120.026 ], and sin 2 \u03b8 13 = [0.010 +0.033   \u22120.034 , 0.023 +0.015 \u22120.015 ]. All solutions to the solar neutrino problem except for the large mixing angle region are excluded. KamLAND also demonstrated almost two cycles of the periodic feature expected from neutrino oscillation effects. KamLAND performed the first experimental study of antineutrinos from the Earth's interior socalled geoneutrinos (geo\u03bd e 's), and succeeded in detecting geo\u03bd e 's produced by the decays of 238 U and 232 Th within the Earth. Assuming a chondritic Th/U mass ratio, we obtain 116 +28",

A neutrino was introduced to be a weakly interacting particle with a neutral charge, a smaller mass than that a e-mail: suzuki@post.kek.jp of an electron and a spin 1/2. In 1934, Fermi [2] developed the theory of \u03b2-decay process, supposing the new concept of particle creation and annihilation processes. In 1956, the discovery of the neutrino came from detecting the inverse \u03b2decay process by Reines et al. [3], using one of the Savannah River nuclear reactors. In 1956, Lee and Yang [4] proposed the parity violation in weak interactions, although the parity had been assumed to be conserved for a long time. Only one year later in 1957, Wu et al. [5] found a definite asymmetry in the angular distribution of electrons emitted in the \u03b2-decay of polarized Co 60 nuclei. The parity was proved to be fully violated in \u03b2-decays. In 1957, Pontecorvo [6] discussed the possibility of neutrino-antineutrino oscillations based on the analogy to an existing phenomenon K 0 K 0 oscillations.",

            "text": "Here, neutrinos are assumed to be two component massless particles, although there is no evidence for massless neutrinos. Pontecorvo [9] and Schwartz [10] independently proposed the feasibility of neutrino experiments, using accelerators. The new question came up as to whether the neutrinos emitted in the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc decay and in the \u03b2-decay are identical or not. In 1962, the experiment at BNL confirmed that the \u03c0 -decay neutrino (\u03bd \u03bc ) is different from the \u03b2-decay neutrino (\u03bd e ) [11]. Based on the existence of two kinds of neutrinos, a particle mixture theory of neutrinos was proposed, which formulates neutrino oscillations of \u03bd e \u03bd \u03bc with their masses and mixing angles [12]. In the 1960s and 1970s, neutrinos were used to probe the structure of nucleons and the property of weak interactions. A key-prediction of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model, so-called the Standard Model was the existence of weak neutral current interactions mediated by the Z 0 boson in addition to the already known W \u00b1 charged bosons. In 1973, the Gargamelle collaboration discovered the weak neutral currents in the bubble chamber Gargamelle exposed to the neutrino beam derived from the CERN PS [13]. In 1983, the super proton synchrotron (SPS) at CERN enabled to produce the weak bosons directly. The experimental groups of UA1 led by Rubbia and UA2 led by Darriulat succeeded in detecting lepton pairs with very large momenta from decays of the W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons [14][15][16][17]. The precise measurement of the number of light neutrinos (m \u03bd < m Z /2) came from studies of Z 0 production in e + e \u2212 collisions. The result was N \u03bd = 2.984 \u00b1 0.008 [18]. In 1998, Super-Kamiokande demonstrated the evidence of atmospheric neutrino oscillations [19]. This is the first observation of a finite neutrino mass. The third kind of neutrino, called \u03bd \u03c4 , was observed by DONUT in 2000 [20].",

These detectors were originally designed for the detection of nucleon decays which were predicted by the idea of Grand Unified Theories. In Japan, the Kamiokande experiment started in 1983, constructing a 3000 ton imaging water Cerenkov detector 1,000 m underground at the Kamioka mine. In 1987, a neutrino burst from the supernova SN1987A was first detected in Kamiokande [21] and the US experiment IMB [22], which resulted in opening a new research field, called neutrino astronomy. In 1989, Kamiokande succeeded in observing solar neutrinos [23] and confirmed the long-standing puzzle of the solar neutrino deficit, which had been first observed by Davis et al. almost 20 years ago [24]. In 1992 and 1994, Kamiokande found the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in which the data of the \u03bd \u03bc /\u03bd e flux ratio is different from the prediction [25,26]. A gigantic 50,000 ton water Cerenkov detector experiment, Super-Kamiokande started the data taking in 1996 and solved the atmospheric neutrino anomaly by showing evidence of neutrino oscillations in 1998 [19]. Neutrino oscillations induced by finite masses and mixing angles became real phenomena and pointed to physics beyond the Standard Model.",

Neutrinos participating in the charged current weak interactions are characterized by the flavor (e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ). But the neutrinos of a definite flavor are not necessarily states of a definite mass. Instead, they are generally coherent superpositions of such states. For instance, in the two-flavor case the states, |\u03bd e > and |\u03bd \u03bc > mix with the mass states |\u03bd 1 > and |\u03bd 2 > as |\u03bd e > = cos \u03b8 12 |\u03bd 1 > + sin \u03b8 12 |\u03bd 2 >, |\u03bd \u03bc >= \u2212sin\u03b8 12 |\u03bd 1 > +cos\u03b8 12 |\u03bd 2 >. Neutrino flavor oscillations are a fundamental consequence of two assumptions: that the neutrino has a finite rest mass and that the neutrino flavor eigenstates mix in the mass eigenstates.

            "text": "With the aim of studying neutrino oscillations furthermore, the KamLAND (1,000 ton Kamioka Liquid Scintillator AntiNeutrino Detector) experiment was proposed in 1994 with the aim of detecting the oscillations of electron antineutrino\u03bd e 's emitted from distant power reactors [27,28]. There are several potential advantages in KamLAND. The Kamioka mine is surrounded with 52 local reactors in 18 Japanese commercial power stations. Among them, 26 reactors are located at nearly an equal distance of 180 km away from the mine and generate a total of \u223c 70 GW (10 9 Watt), which corresponds to \u223c12 % of the world nuclear power generation. In particular, the Kashiwazaki station shown in Fig. 1 is the world highest power station with 24.3 GW. The same distance means that the effects of oscillations will add up rather than average out between different reactors. The contribution of the neutrino flux from overseas and Japanese research reactors is less than 5 %. Figure 1 also shows the map of commercial nuclear power stations in Japan and the expected event rate for one year exposure with a 1,000 ton detector as a function of the distance from Kamioka. Applying such desirable conditions as a huge reactor power, an extremely long and definite baseline of 180 km and the relatively lower energy of reactor neutrinos, KamLAND improves the detection sensitivity of the m 2 oscillation parameter by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous reactor experiments. This accessible parameter region covers one of the candidate solutions to the solar neutrino deficit problem, which is called the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) theory with 3\u00d710 \u22125 < m 2 < 2 \u00d710 \u22124 (eV 2 ). KamLAND aims at solving the solar neutrino deficit problem under laboratory conditions (Fig. 2).",

The Kam-LAND liquid scintillator (LS) is a chemical cocktail of 80 % dodecane, 20 % pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) and 1.36 g/l of PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole) as a fluorescence. The light output of the LS is \u223c8,000 photons/MeV. The scintillator is housed in a 13 m-diameter spherical balloon made of 3-layers of nylon with a total thickness of 135 \u00b5m and supported by a cargo net structure at the top of the stainless-steel vessel. This balloon system hangs inside the 18m-diameter stainless-steel spherical vessel. A buffer mixture of dodecane and isoparaffin oils fills the volume between the stainlesssteel vessel and the balloon. Its density is 0.04 % lighter than that of the liquid scintillator to reduce the mechanical load on the balloon. The entire inner surface of the vessel (Inner Detector: ID) is covered by an array of a total of 1,879 photomultiplier tubes (PMT's), 1,325 of which are specially developed 17-in. and 554 of which are the old Kamiokande 20-in. devices. The total photocathode coverage is 34 %, but only the 17-in. PMT's reach 22 %. The 17-in. PMT has the same shape and overall size as the 20-in. PMT, but the photosensitive area is restricted to a central 17-in. diameter with an attached black acrylic cover (see Fig. 4a). This modification makes it possible to use a box-and-line dynode structure instead of the venetian-blind dynode used in the 20-in. PMT's. As a consequence, under conditions of singlephotoelectron illumination at 25 \u2022 C and with the applied high-voltage giving a gain of 10 7 , the 17-in. PMT's offer (1-1.5) ns transit-time spread; an output pulse peak-to-valley ratio of (3-5); and a 10 kHz dark count-rate for signals above 1/4 photoelectron. Better than that, the 17-in. tubes show not only a linear response for up to 1,000 photoelectron signal level, but also no saturation even at 10,000 photoelectron illumination. This allows us to study more physics associated with events that result from high-energy deposition inside the detector generated by atmospheric neutrinos, nucleon decays, and so on. The comparison of PMT performance between the 17 and 20-in. PMT's is shown in Fig. 4b.",

            "text": "During the measurement period of KamLAND from March 9, 2002 to January 11, 2004, 52 commercial reactors in 16 electric power stations and a prototype reactor were in operation in Japan. All Japanese commercial reactors are light water reactors (LWR); 29 for boiling water reactors (BWR) and 23 for pressurized water reactors (PWR). Both types of LWR contain 3-5 % enriched uranium fuel. Generally reactor operation stops once a year for refueling and regular maintenance. During the refueling, one fourth of the total nuclear fuel is exchanged in BWRs and one third in PWR's. To calculate production rates of reactor\u03bd e , knowledge of the correlation between the \"core thermal output\" and the fission rates is required. The \"core thermal output\" is defined as the thermal energy generated in the reactor cores, and it is calculated by measuring the heat balance of the reactor cores. The heat taken out by the cooling water is the dominant dissipation source of the reactor energy. Other contributions are less than 1 %. Therefore, the uncertainty of the calculated core thermal output is dominated by the accuracy of measuring the cooling water which itself is given mainly by the accuracy of measuring the flow of the coolant. The accuracy of the flow of the coolant in turn is determined by as the data-taking interval of March 9, 2002 to January 11, 2004. These data are provided according to the special agreement between Tohoku Univ. and the Japanese nuclear power-reactor organization the uncertainty of the feedwater-flowmeters, which is calibrated to within 2 %. In KamLAND, a value of 2 % is used as the uncertainty of the core thermal output. To calculate the total\u03bd e flux in KamLAND, it is required to trace the time variation of the fission rate of all reactors, and to understand the burn-up process of nuclear fuel. The process of burn-up is complicated and depends on the core type, history of the burn-up, initial enrichment, fuel-exchange history, etc. Detailed simulations exist that calculate the change of the fuel components in accordance with the burn-up. Our simplified model uses only a few reactor operation parameters in calculating\u03bd e flux, and agrees with the energy spectrum from detailed reactor core simulations within 1 % for different reactor types and burn-up [30]. This simplified model may be applicable to future long-baseline reactor neutrino experiments which make use of several reactors. Once the fission rates of fissile isotopes are obtained, th\u0113 \u03bd e energy spectra except for 238 U are obtained through the following procedure: (i) measurement of the total \u03b2-ray spectrum [31][32][33], (ii) fitting with 30 individual hypothetical \u03b2ray spectra and (iii) conversion of \u03b2-ray spectra to neutrino spectra. Since 238 U undergoes a fast neutron fission, its fission spectrum relies on calculations, considering 744 traces of fission products. Figure 12a shows the neutrino energy spectrum of each fissile isotope in the KamLAND detector. Contributions from long-lived fissile nuclei like 106 Ru (T 1/2 = 372 days), 144 Ce (285 days) and 90 Sr (28.6 years) in reactor cores and in the cooling pool are not negligible in the low-energy region. Although fission spectra reach equilibrium within a day above \u223c2 MeV, the neutrino flux from those nuclei does not have strong correlation with reactor power output and long term average power should be used, instead, to estimate their contributions. Figure 12c shows the expected reactor\u03bd e energy spectra for four main fissile isotopes at Kamioka.",

We evaluated the detection rate of ge\u014d \u03bd e 's in KamLAND, using various geophysical and geochemical models [35]. In Fig. 14, a smooth broad histogram is the expected visible energy spectrum of positrons produced by reactor\u03bd e 's, and two sharp peaks in the energy below 2.5 MeV are expected by geo\u03bd e 's. In the reactor neutrino oscillation analysis, positrons with energies above 2.6 MeV are used to avoid the geoneutrino pollution.",

The light quenching of the scattered proton by the neutron was precisely measured within \u00b12 % by carrying out an experiment using a monochromatic neutron beam to hit the KamLAND LS sample. As a consequence, it is found that the cross sections for the excited 16 O states from Ref. [40] agree with the 210 Po 13 C data after scaling the first excited state by 0.6; the second excited state requires no scaling. For the ground state, the cross section from Ref. [42] and a scale by 1.05 are used in the analysis. Including the 210 Po decay rate assigns an uncertainty of 11 % for the ground state and 20 % for the excited states.

Here the spectral distortion due to the systematic uncertainties for the backgrounds is considered in the following: for the 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O background shown by the green color in the figure, a free-scale uncertainty around 6 MeV and a 32 % scale uncertainty of the estimated rate around 2.6 and 4.4 MeV are applied to fitting. KamLAND gave the first evidence of the spectrum distortion in neutrino experiments with the confidence level \u223c 3 \u03c3 . The reactor neutrino anomaly defined as the combined effect of the rate disappearance and spectrum distortion is found at the high confidence level of 99.999995 %.",

In the ANA-II data sample, we account for the 9 Li accidental and the 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O, background rates.

L 0 is the effective baseline taken as a flux weighted average (L 0 = 180 km). The points from the previous reactor experiments are also shown here [34]. The dashed curve in this figure is derived, using the best-fit oscillation parameters with the assumption that all Japanese nuclear reactors are 180 km distant from Kamioka. The histogram and curve show the expectation accounting for the distances to the individual reactors, time-dependent flux variations, and efficiencies. The  Fig. 27 show the best-fit decay and Fig. 26 Ratio of the background and geoneutrino subtracted\u03bd e spectrum to the expectation for the no-oscillation as a function of L 0 (=180 km})/E. The energy bins are equal probability bins of the best fit including all background (see Fig. 22) Fig. 27 The same ratio as Fig. 26. The solid (blue), dash (red) and dash-dot (green) histograms are the expectations from the best-fit oscillations, best-fit decay and best-fit decoherence, taking into account the individual time-dependent flux variations of all reactors and detector effects decoherence behaviors.

            "text": "It is generally agreed that the Earth core must produce a significant amount of energy, which is necessary to maintain convection in the outer core as well as the magnetic field of the Earth. It is claimed that a significant part of the heat production in the core is due to the presence of Blobs of concentrated uranium (U) that act as fast breeder reactors [65]. We call this type reactor a geo-reactor. Although the geo-reactor is attractive so as to explain the mechanism for flips of the geo-magnetic field, it is not a mainstream theory. However, nobody can rule out the geo-reactor hypothesis by any evidence. Usually the content of the inner core is based on the carbonaceous and oxygen-rich chondrites. As a result, U and thorium (Th) do not sink but stay in the crust and mantle. On the other hand, in the natural nuclear reactor model, the inner core comprises the rare enstatite chondrites and is poor in oxygen. In consequence, U and Th can sink to the Earth's center. Collected evidence shows that there are still open issues with models of the Earth. KamLAND can perform a fully independent check of the geo-reactor hypothesis and set a clean limit on its possible power output. The signature from the geo-reactor is given as a time-constant\u03bd e flux over the duration of the experiment. Time evolution of the expected and observed reactor rates at KamLAND for\u03bd e 's with energies between 2.6 and 8.5 MeV shown in Fig. 18b is used for this analysis. The observed event rate is plotted at the exposure-weighted expected event rate of reactor\u03bd e 's + backgrounds in Fig. 28a. The oscillation parameters used to calculate the expected reactor\u03bd e rate are the best-fit values from the global oscillation analysis, including constraints on \u03b8 13 from accelerators and short-baseline reactor experiments (see Table 3). The contribution of ge\u014d \u03bd e 's is negligible in this energy range. The intercept can be interpreted as the reactor-independent constant background rate. The geo-reactor signal is embedded in the y-axis intercept. The fit tells that the intercept is consistent with known backgrounds within 1\u03c3 and gives a limit on the geo-reactor power of <3.1 TW at 90 % C.L. and <3.7 TW at 95 % C.L. This is comparable to 3 TW of theoretical predictions for geo-reactor. Therefore with a new set of data and more extensive study, KamLAND might be able to set a limit on theoretical predictions.",

Each sub-region has different 238 U and 232 Th concentrations. The bulk chemical composition of the Earth is studied based on the analysis of a chondritic meteorite, which is thought to be close to the Earth ingredients, and then the bulk silicate Earth model (BSE model [77]) was constructed. Our reference Earth model completely follows the BSE model. Table 4 summarizes the 238 U and 232 Th concentrations of our reference Earth model. One can see the 232 Th/ 238 U mass ratio distributes between 2.2 and 4.0 in each region. The present model assumes that the ratio of chemical composition, 232 Th/ 238 U at each region is uniform, and 238 U and 232 Th are absent inside the core.",

On the other hand, backgrounds are dominated by reactor\u03bd e 's, and by \u03b1-particle induced neutron backgrounds from the 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O reaction. The energy spectrum of reactor\u03bd e 's in this energy region is determined by analyzing\u03bd e 's with energies greater than 3.4 MeV, where there is no signal from the geo\u03bd e 's. Using the reactor neutrino oscillation parameters, the number of reactor\u03bd e background events is estimated to be 80.4 \u00b1 7.2. The number of \u03b1-particle induced neutron background events is 42 \u00b1 11. Including other small contribution from random coincidences, the total background is 127 \u00b1 13 events (1\u03c3 error). Thus 25 +19 \u221218 geo\u03bd e candidates from the 238 U and 232 Th decay chains are extracted. This result is consistent with the 19 events predicted by our reference Earth model. Dividing by the detection efficiency, live-time, and number of target protons, the total geo\u03bd e 's detected rate is obtained 5.1 +3.9 \u22123.63 \u00d7 10 \u221231\u03bd e per target proton per year. An unbinned maximum likelihood analysis of the\u03bd e energy spectrum between 1.7 and 3.4 MeV is carried out as a cross-check of extracting the number of geo\u03bd e events. Here the reactor neutrino oscillation parameters are allowed to adopt the values of the best-fit \u00b11\u03c3 . The confidence intervals for the number of geo\u03bd e 's are shown in Fig. 33 (left). The best fit gives 21 geo\u03bd e 's shown by the dark circle. Although this result is somehow contradict with that of the reference Earth model indicated by the rectangular box in Fig. 33 (left), even 68.3 % C.L. contour covers this box. Based on a study of chondritic meteorites, the Th/U mass ratio in the Earth is believed to be between 3.7 and 4.1, and it is known better than either absolute concentration. Hence we investigate the \u03c7 2 behavior, assuming a Th/U mass ratio of 3.9, which corresponds to the \u03c7 2 distribution along the dotted line in Fig.  Fig. 33   [79]. While Borexino confirmed the excess from KamLAND, its result was not precise enough to significantly constrain geophysical models. The KamLAND second results on a measurement of geo\u03bd e flux were presented based on data collected from March 9, 2002 to November 4, 2009, which includes the data used in ANA-I, ANA-II, and ANA-III [80]. The total exposure to\u03bd e is 3.49\u00d710 32 target-proton years, a fivefold improvement over the first KamLAND geo\u03bd e result [78]. The expected signal based on the reference Earth model increased from 19 events to 106 events. After the first results, several improvements to reduce systematic errors for selecting\u03bd e events were carried out as mentioned above in the ANA-III data analysis. The overall efficiencies for U and Th events are estimated to be 80.7 and 75.1 %, respectively. The difference comes from the energy-dependent efficiencies.",

Since current Earth models predict that the lithophiles U and Th are absent in the core, to a first approximation of the radiogenic heat, we attribute any excess above the crustal contribution to U and Th uniformly distributed throughout the mantle. Under these generic assumptions, the measured KamLAND geo\u03bd e flux translates to a total radiogenic heat production of 11.2 +7.9 \u22125.1 TW from U and Th. This calculation accounts for crustal uncertainties of 17 and 10 % for U and Th, respectively, including correlated errors as suggested in [81]. To parameterize the planetary-scale energy balance, the fraction of the global heat production from radioactive decays, the so-called \"Urey ratio\" is introduced. Allowing for mantle heat contributions of 3.0 TW from other isotope decays [82,83], we find that the convective Urey ratio, the contribution to the Urey ratio from just the mantle, is between 0.09 and 0.42 at 68 % C.L.

The\u03bd e flux predictions vary within the plotted vertical bands due to uncertainties in both the abundances of radioactive elements in the mantle and their distributions. The spread of the slope reflects the difference between two extreme radiochemical distributions: the \"homogeneous hypothesis\", in which U and Th are assumed to be distributed uniformly throughout the mantle, and the \"sunken-layer hypothesis\", which assumes that all of the U and Th below the crust collects at the mantle-core interface. While the statistical treatment of geological uncertainties is not straightforward, assuming Gaussian errors for the crustal contribution and for the BSE abundances, we find that the geodynamical prediction with the homogeneous hypothesis is disfavored at 89 % C.L.

With the assumption of CPT invariance, the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) is the only remaining oscillation solution consistent with the KamLAND result. Furthermore, because observed \u03bd e 's are created in nuclear reactors rather than in the core of the Sun, several alternative possible solutions to the solar neutrino deficit, for instance, the neutrino magnetic moment and unknown neutrino interactions inside the Sun, are excluded. This means that the solar neutrino deficit problem, which lasted for almost 30 years, is finally solved.
