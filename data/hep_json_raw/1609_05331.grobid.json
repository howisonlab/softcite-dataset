Data from LHC proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , have been collected with the CMS detector. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T clustering algorithm with a size parameter of 0.7 in a phase space region covering jet p T from 74 GeV up to 2.5 TeV and jet absolute rapidity up to |y| = 3.0. The low-p T jet range between 21 and 74 GeV is also studied up to |y| = 4.7, using a dedicated data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 pb \u22121 . The measured jet cross section is corrected for detector effects and compared with the predictions from perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) using various sets of parton distribution functions (PDF). Cross section ratios to the corresponding measurements performed at 2.76 and 7 TeV are presented. From the measured double-differential jet cross section, the value of the strong coupling constant evaluated at the Z mass is \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1164 +0.0060   \u22120.0043 , where the errors include the PDF, scale, nonperturbative effects and experimental uncertainties, using the CT10 NLO PDFs. Improved constraints on PDFs based on the inclusive jet cross section measurement are presented.",

[12] an increased sensitivity of such ratios to PDFs was suggested. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC during 2012 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The average number of multiple collisions within the same bunch crossing (known as pileup) is 21. A low-pileup data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 pb \u22121 is collected with an average of four interactions per bunch crossing; this is used for a low-p T jet cross section measurement. The measured cross sections are corrected for detector effects and compared to the QCD prediction at NLO. The high-p T part of the differential cross section, where the sensitivity to the value of \u03b1 S is maximal, is measured more accurately than before. Also, the kinematic region of small p T and large y is probed. The measured cross section is used to extract the value of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale, \u03b1 S (M Z ), and to study the scale dependence of \u03b1 S in a wider kinematic range than is accessible at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Further, the impact of the present measurements on PDFs is illustrated in a QCD analysis using the present measurements and the cross sections of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at HERA [13].",

Jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of the momenta of all particles in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5% to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance, before corrections are applied. In order to suppress the contamination from pileup, only reconstructed charged particles associated to the PV are used in jet clustering. Jet energy scale (JES) corrections are derived from simulation, by using events generated with pythia6 and processed through the CMS detector simulation that is based on the geant 4 [20] package, and from in situ measurements by exploiting the energy balance in dijet, photon+jet, and Z+jet events [21,22]. The pythia6 version 4.22 [23] is used, with the Z2 * tune. The Z2 * tune is derived from the Z1 tune [24] but uses the CTEQ6L [25] parton distribtion set whereas the Z1 tune uses the CTEQ5L set. The Z2 * tune is the result of retuning the pythia6 parameters PARP(82) and PARP(90) by means of the automated PROFESSOR tool [26], yielding PARP(82)=1.921 and PARP(90)=0.227. The JES corrections account for residual nonuniformities and nonlinearities in the detector response. An offset correction is required to account for the extra energy clustered into jets due to pileup. The JES correction, applied as a multiplicative factor to the jet four momentum vector, depends on the values of jet \u03b7 and p T . For a jet with a p T of 100 GeV the typical correction is about 10%, and decreases with increasing p T . The jet energy resolution (JER) is approximately 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV.",

A requirement is made that the ratio of E miss T and the sum of the transverse energy of the PF particles is smaller than 0.3, which removes background events and leaves a negligible residual contamination. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like signatures originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. To suppress the noise patterns, tight identification criteria are applied: each jet should contain at least two PF particles, one of which is a charged hadron, and the jet energy fraction carried by neutral hadrons and photons should be less than 90%. These criteria have an efficiency greater than 99% for genuine jets. Events are selected that contain at least one jet with a p T higher than the p T threshold of the lowest-threshold trigger that recorded the event.",

The widths of the p T bins increase with p T and are proportional to the p T resolution. The phase space in absolute rapidity |y| is subdivided into six bins starting from y = 0 up to |y| = 3.0 with \u2206|y| = 0.5. In the low-p T jet measurement an additional rapidity bin 3.2 < |y| < 4.7 is included. The statistical uncertainty for each bin is computed according to the number of events contributing to at least one entry per event [6], corrected for possible multiple entries per event. This correction is small, since at least 90% of the observed jets in each \u2206p T and \u2206|y| bin originate from different events. In order to compare the measured cross section with theoretical predictions at particle level, the steeply falling jet p T spectra must be corrected for experimental p T resolution. An unfolding procedure, based on the iterative D'Agostini method [27], implemented in the RooUnfold package [28], is used to correct the measured spectra for detector effects. The response matrix is created by the convolution of theoretically predicted spectra, discussed in section 5, with the JER effects. These effects are evaluated as a function of p T with the CMS detector simulation, after correcting for the residual differences from data [21]. The unfolding procedure induces statistical correlations among the bins. The sizes of these correlations typically vary between 10% and 20%.",

For the high-p T jet data set, this uncertainty is decomposed into 24 independent sources, corresponding to the different components of the corrections: pileup effects, relative calibration of JES versus \u03b7, absolute JES including p T dependence, and differences in quark-and gluon-initiated jets. The set of components, used here, is discussed in detail in ref. [22], and represents an evolution of the decomposition presented in ref. [29]. The low-pileup data set uses a reduced number of components, since the pileup-related corrections are negligible, and there is no JES time dependence. Moreover, the central values of the corrections, for the components common between the two data sets, are not the same; the low-p T jet analysis uses corrections computed only on the initial part of the 2012 data sample. The impact of the uncertainty induced by each correction component on the measured cross section is evaluated separately. The JES-induced uncertainty in the cross section depends on p T and y. For the high-p T data, this ranges from 2% to 4% in the sub-TeV region at central rapidity to about 20% in the highest p T bins for rapidities 1.0 < |y| < 2.0. Due to the different set of corrections used, the low-p T jet cross section has a larger JES uncertainty than the contiguous bins of the high-p T part, and this effect becomes more pronounced as the jet rapidity increases.",

The pQCD NLO calculations are performed by using the NLOJet++ (version 4.1.3) program [32,33] as implemented in the fastNLO (version 2.1) package [35]. The renormalization (\u00b5 R ) and factorization (\u00b5 F ) scales are both set to the leading jet p T . The calculations are performed by using six PDF sets determined at NLO: CT10 [36], MSTW2008 [37], NNPDF2.1 [38], NNPDF3.0 [39], HERAPDF1.5 [40], and ABM11 [41]. Each PDF set is available for a range of \u03b1 S (M Z ) values. The number of active (massless) flavours chosen in NLOJet++ is five in all of the PDF sets except NNPDF2.1, where it is set to six. All the PDF sets use a variable flavour number scheme, except ABM11, which uses a fixed flavour number scheme. The basic characteristics of each PDF set are summarized in  The parton-level calculation at NLO has to be supplemented with corrections due to nonperturbative (NP) effects, i.e. hadronization and multiparton interactions (MPI). The nonperturbative effects are estimated using both leading order (LO) and NLO event generators. In the former case, the correction is evaluated by averaging those provided by pythia6 [23] (version 4.26), using tune Z2 * , and herwig++ (version 2.4.2) [42], using tune UE [43]. The size of these corrections ranges from 20% at low p T to 1% at the highest p T of 2.5 TeV. The NLO nonperturbative correction is derived using powheg [44][45][46][47], interfaced with pythia6 for parton shower, MPI, and hadronization. The nonperturbative correction factors are derived in this case by averaging the results for two different tunes of pythia6, Z2 * and P11 [48]. Hadronization models have been tuned by using LO calculations for the hard scattering, and applying these tunes to NLO-based calculations is not expected to provide optimal results. On the other hand, the application of nonperturbative corrections based on LO calculations to NLO predictions implicitly assumes that the behaviour of nonperturbative effects is independent of the hard scattering description. To take into account both facts, the final number used for the nonperturbative correction, C NP , is an arithmetic average of the LO-and NLO-based estimates. Half the width of the envelope of these predictions is used as the uncertainty due to the nonperturbative correction. Figure 1 shows the nonperturbative correction factors derived by combining both LO-and NLObased calculations.",

A calculation of the ratio of cross sections measured at 7 and 8 TeV presented in ref. [12], for instance, suggests a larger sensitivity to PDFs in the jet p T range between 1 and 2 TeV. Therefore, it is interesting to study such cross section ratios. Differential cross sections for the inclusive jet production have been measured by the CMS Collaboration at \u221a s = 2.76 [2] and 7 TeV [6]. Ratios are computed of the doubledifferential cross section presented in this paper at 8 TeV to the corresponding measurements at different energies. For p T > 74 GeV, the choice of jet p T and rapidity bins is identical for the various measurements, thus allowing an easy computation of the ratio. Only the high-p T jet data set at 8 TeV is used, since no counterpart of the low-p T jet analysis is available for the other centre-of-mass energies.",

In this paper, we use the inclusive jet cross section measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV for p T > 74 GeV in a QCD analysis at NLO together with the combined measurements of neutral-and charged-current cross sections of deep inelastic electron (positron)-proton scattering at HERA [13]. The correlations of the experimental uncertainties for the jet measurements and DIS cross sections are taken into account. The DIS measurements and the CMS jet cross section data are treated as uncorrelated. The theoretical predictions for the cross sections of jet production are calculated at NLO by using the NLOJet++ program [32,33] as implemented into the fastNLO package [35]. The open-source QCD fit framework for PDF determination herafitter [58,59]  Table 6. Composition of the uncertainty in \u03b1 S (M Z ) fit results in ranges of p T . For each range, the corresponding statistical and experimental systematic uncertainties and the components of the theoretical uncertainty are shown.

Additional D and E parameters allow probing the sensitivity of results on the specific selected functional form. The parameters in eqs.

            "text": "The extraction of the PDFs from the jet cross sections depends on the value of \u03b1 S . Consequently, the PDF fits are repeated taking \u03b1 S to be a free parameter. In this way, the PDFs and the strong coupling constant are determined simultaneously, diminishing the correlation between the gluon PDF and \u03b1 S . The experimental, model, and parameterization uncertainties of \u03b1 S (M Z ) are obtained in a manner similar to the procedure for determining uncertainties of the PDFs. The uncertainty due to missing higher-order corrections in the theoretical predictions for jet production cross sections is estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales. The scales are varied independently by a factor of two with respect to the default choice of \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F equal to the p T of the jet and the combined fit of PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ) is repeated for each variation of the scale choice in the following six combinations: (\u00b5 R /p T , \u00b5 F /p T ) = (0.5,0.5), (0.5,1), (1,0.5), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). The scale for the HERA DIS data is not changed. The maximal observed upward and downward changes of \u03b1 S (M Z ) with respect to the default are then taken as the scale uncertainty. The strong coupling constant is \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1185 +0.0019 \u22120.0021 (exp) +0.0002 \u22120.0015 (model) +0.0000 \u22120.0004 (param) +0.0022 \u22120.0018 (scale). Within the uncertainties, this value is consistent with the one determined in section 8 and is an important cross-check of the \u03b1 S (M Z ) obtained by using the fixed PDF. The scale uncertainties in \u03b1 S (M Z ) obtained simultaneously with the PDFs are smaller due to consistent treatment of the scales in the PDFs and the theory prediction for the jet cross sections in the simultaneous fit. The evaluation of scale uncertainties is an open issue that is ignored in all global PDF fits to date. There is no recommended procedure for the determination of the scale uncertainties in combined fits of PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ).",

The dominant sources of experimental systematic uncertainty are due to the jet energy scale, unfolding, and the integrated luminosity measurement. These lead to uncertainties of 5-45% in the differential cross section measurement. The theoretical predictions are most affected by PDF uncertainties, and their range is strongly dependent on the p T and rapidity interval; at low p T they are about 7%, but their size increases up to 40% in the most central intervals and exceeds 200% in the outermost regions. Many uncertainties cancel in the ratio with the corresponding results at 2.76 and 7 TeV, leading to uncertainties ranging from 5% to 25%, both for the measurement and for the theoretical predictions.",
