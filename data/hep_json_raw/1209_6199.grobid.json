The generated true charged multiplicity in MC simulation is even, i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, \u2022\u2022\u2022. The observed MC multiplicity distribution is obtained after simulation and event selection.

            "text": "A detailed topology analysis is performed for N good = 0 events in the inclusive MC sample. Most of these events come from known decay channels, such as \u03c8 \u2192 X + J/\u03c8 (X = \u03b7, \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , and \u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . The fraction of pure neutral events is less than 1.0%. For the known charged decay modes, the MC simulation works well according to many comparisons between data and MC simulation in Section 3. To investigate the pure neutral channels, the same selection criteria at the track level are used. The criteria at the event level include N good =0 and N \u03b3 > 3. The latter requirement is used to suppress e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and beamassociated background events. The same selection criteria are imposed on the off-resonance data. Figs. 11(a) and (b) show the distribution of total energy in the EMC for data and inclusive MC events. The peaking events correspond to the pure neutral candidates, and the number of events is extracted by fitting. The difference in the number of fitted events between data and inclusive MC events is found to be 17%. Therefore, the uncertainty due to the pure neutral events should be less than 17%\u00d71% = 0.17%, and this is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the missing 0-prong events.",

The possible imperfection from other MC modeling, in fact, can be reflected by tracking, charged-track multiplicity, and the missing of 0-prong events. The uncertainties caused by above sources have also been studied carefully. Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce an extra uncertainty due to MC modeling. Table 3 lists all systematic errors.
