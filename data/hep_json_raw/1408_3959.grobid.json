But asymmetries in Dp collisions (accessible only at NICA) are expected to be non-zero. The production of lepton pairs in the qq processes, via J/\u03a8 with its subsequent decay into leptons, is analogous to the DY production mechanism. The analogy is correct if the J/\u03a8 interactions with quarks and leptons are of the vector type. This analogy is known under the name 'duality model'. It may be tested by checking that tensor polarization of J/\u03a8 is a transverse one. For the TMD PDF studies, the duality model can predict a similar behavior of asymmetries in the lepton pairs production calculated via DY and via J/\u03a8 events. This similarity follows from the duality model ideas. At NICA such a comparison can be performed at various colliding beam energies.",

Birefringence occurs when spin particles pass through isotropic non-polarized matter and is due to the inherent anisotropy of particles (as distinct from spin-1/2 particles). The birefringence effect leads to the rotation of the beam polarization vector when a nonpolarized deuteron beam passes through a non-polarized target. Moreover, the appearing spin dichroism effect (the different absorption of deuterons in states with |m| = 1 and m = 0) gives rise to a tensor polarization of the initially non-polarized deuteron beam that has passed through the non-polarized target The experiments using carbon targets and deuterons with a momentum of 5 GeV/c were performed at Nuclotron-M accelerator.

To provide zero spin tune regime at the collider of the racetrack symmetry, it is necessary to install two identical siberian snakes in the opposite straight sections.
