At the deeper site, multiple-muon events with muons separated by more than 8 m exhibit a seasonal rate that peaks during the summer, similar to that of single-muon events. In contrast and unexpectedly, the rate of multiplemuon events with muons separated by less than 5-8 m, and the rate of multiple-muon events in the smaller, shallower Near Detector, exhibit a seasonal rate modulation that peaks in the winter.",

            "text": "Muons observed in underground particle detectors originate from the interactions of cosmic rays with nuclei in the upper atmosphere. These interactions produce pions (\u03c0) and kaons (K) which can either interact, generating hadronic cascades, or decay, producing muons. The probability that these mesons will decay rather than interact is dependent on their energy and the density of the atmosphere near their point of production. The temperature of the upper atmosphere varies slowly over the year, causing a seasonal effect on underground muon rates. Increases in the temperature of the atmosphere decrease the local density and thus reduce the probability that a secondary meson will interact. Consequently, the muon flux should increase in the summer. A number of experiments have observed this variation in the single muon rate [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11], including MINOS in both Far Detector (FD) data [12,13] and Near Detector (ND) data [14].",

The magnitude of the temperature coefficient \u03b1 T is dependent on the muon energy at production and hence the depth of the detector. The effective temperature T ef f is a weighted average over the region of the atmosphere where the muons originate. By the same reasoning as above a variation should also be present in the rate of multiple-muon events. No such studies of multiple-muon seasonal rates are reported in the literature. The formulae used to calculate T ef f for single muons assume a single leading hadron from the first interaction is the parent, an assumption that is not applicable for multiple-muon events.",

Assuming the relative probability of interaction and decay for each meson in a shower is independent, for multiple muons that come from the same energy and altitude as a single muon event, one might expect an increase in rate during the summer that is roughly proportional to the muon multiplicity, N, such that \u03b1 T,N = N \u00d7 \u03b1 T,1 . The result presented here differs greatly from this. This paper presents the first measurement of the multiple-muon modulation parameters.",

The MINOS ND has a total mass of 0.98 kton, and lies 104 m (225 mwe) underground at Fermilab at 42 \u2022 North latitude. The detector is made from 3.8 m \u00d7 4.8 m hexagonal planes and is 17 m long. It consists of two sections, a calorimeter encompassing the upstream 121 planes and a spectrometer containing the downstream 161 planes. In both sections, one out of every five planes is covered with 96 scintillator strips attached to the steel planes. In the calorimeter section, the other four out of five planes are covered with 64 scintillator strips, while in the spectrometer section they have no scintillator. Only muons which enter the calorimeter are included in this analysis. The larger FD is 705 m below the surface (2100 mwe), has a total mass of 5. 4  are analyzed for this paper. The cosmic muon trigger criteria are similar at both detectors requiring that a signal is registered in either 4 strips in 5 sequential planes or that strips from any 20 planes register a total signal above threshold within a given time window. The raw cosmic trigger rate at the ND and FD are approximately 27 Hz and 0.5 Hz respectively. The single-muon event selection requires there to be a single reconstructed track in an event. The multiplemuon event selection requires there to be more than one reconstructed track in an event. However, since the single-muon event rate is much larger than the multiplemuon event rate, the multiple-muon sample contains a background of single-muon events that have been misreconstructed to contain two tracks This background is greatly reduced by requiring that, for multi-track events, the track separation, \u2206S, defined as the minimum distance of closest approach between any two tracks, be greater than 0.6 m. Observed excesses due to this background at small \u2206S in both the ND and FD were removed by this selection, reducing the background from 1.3% to less than 200 events out of 11 million in the FD. Figure 1 shows the time between sequential multiple-muon events. The multiple-muon event rates at the ND and FD are 19.6 mHz and 14.1 mHz respectively. In total the MI-NOS ND and FD have collected 2.45\u00d710 6 and 3.36\u00d710 6 good multiple-muon events respectively.",

However, the reconstructed multiplicity is frequently too low for high multiplicity events. No event with m \u00b5 > 13 is recorded in either of the MINOS detectors. Similar measurements with the finer-grained Soudan 2 detector at the same depth as the MINOS FD recorded multiplicities up to 20 [17].

The multiplemuon event rate data show a clear modulation signature. However, unlike the single muon rate which reaches its maximum in the summer [14], the multiple-muon rate reaches its maximum in the winter. This also matches the modulation for the region-A multiple muons in the FD. Both the single-muon and multiple-muon data sets have periods consistent with one year but their phases, 198.6\u00b10.9 days and 23.7\u00b12.3 days respectively, differ by about six months. The rates of multiple muons and single muons, binned by calendar month and averaged over all years of data-taking, are shown in Fig. 7. Figure 8 shows the track separation in ND multiplemuon events. To qualitatively match the procedure in the FD, the data have been grouped into three bins of roughly equal statistics with track separations of 0.6-1.8 m (ND region A), 1.8-3.0 m (ND region B) and greater than 3 m (ND region C). As before, the data are fit to Eq. (2) and the best fit parameters are given in Table I. There is no apparent difference in the fit parameters for the  three ND regions, which all peak in the winter. There is consistency between ND regions ABC and FD region A in both \u2206S and a winter maximum.",

Those muon rates rose in the summer as did the calculated values of T ef f , and the measured correlations were \u03b1 N D T = 0.428 \u00b1 0.059 [14] and \u03b1 F D T = 0.873 \u00b1 0.014 [13]. The measurement of a multiple-muon rate in the ND that peaks in the winter is unexpected, as is the winter maximum in the FD in region A of separation. In order to try to understand this result, four plausible explanations which might account for these results are considered. They involve: A) a source of dimuons from prompt hadron decays (such as \u03b7 and \u03c1) that may have the opposite seasonal variation, since in the winter the  secondary pions are more likely to interact than decay and produce more of such hadrons; B) a geometric effect in which different altitude distributions affect the track separation underground; C) a different altitude distribution for multimuon events that may come from regions of the atmosphere with different seasonal temperature profiles; and D) leading secondary hadrons being more likely to decay than interact in the summer, and thus less likely to make multiple hadrons which make multiple muons. We discuss each of these possibilities in the current section. ",

In the winter, while pions are less likely to decay in the atmosphere, the decay probability of other hadrons which have dimuon decays, such as \u03b7 and \u03c1 mesons, changes negligibly. The 2% more pions [13] which interact will increase the number of these other hadrons. This increase, which is at most 2%, must then be folded in with the small dimuon branching ratios, such as 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for \u03c1 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 [36]. Observed dimuon rates are 1% of the single muon rates in the FD, and 0.16% in the ND, so even if \u03c1 and \u03b7 production were comparable to \u03c0, this contribution is at most 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , too small to account for the observed effect.",

This would be solely a geometric effect, in that it would not affect the number of multimuons in each season but only the trackseparation distribution. This is further complicated by multiple scattering, but an effect due to the opening angle at production can be estimated. For a fixed-size detector, a difference in the track separation distribution would affect the measured rate. The altitude of the first interaction in an isothermal atmosphere is related to the absolute temperature. A \u00b1 2% seasonal change in the effective temperature would cause a \u00b1 2% change in the altitude, and hence less than a 4% change in the average muon track separation underground. This would move events to the right in Fig. 3. Due to the shape of the distribution, more events would move from region A to region B than from region B to region C, which is in contradiction to our fits. Also, one would expect a similar effect in the ND, but as shown in Table I, the track separation dependence is not seen.",

The distribution of track separation obtained with this simulation was similar to, but not identical to, the distribution seen in data (Fig. 3). We then extracted from CORSIKA the altitude at which each muon was created in each track-separation region. Those three distributions are shown in Fig. 10. There is a shift in the mean altitude for each region of track separation from 17 km in region A to 21 km in region C, though all three distributions are quite broad. We then combined the altitude dependence with the temperature phase and amplitude fits shown in Fig. 9, assuming the rate and T ef f were completely correlated, to compare the overall variation of T ef f averaged over each track-separation region. The result was a variation that peaked in the summer in all three regions, with an amplitude of 1.9% in region C and 1.6% in regions A and B.

            "text": "As a last hypothesis, while most single-muon events come from secondary pions and kaons produced in the primary cosmic ray interaction, multiple muons may be more likely to come from higher energy primaries where there are further hadronic interactions deeper in the shower. In that case, if the secondary hadron is more likely to decay in the summer, it is less likely to interact and make additional pions and kaons which contribute to multiple muons. This may be the best explanation for the winter maximum measured in the MINOS ND multiplemuon data set. A quantitative test of this hypothesis will require a detailed study of air shower development that is beyond the scope of this analysis. This hypothesis accounts for the stronger effect in the MINOS ND, where the muons come from pions and kaons below their critical energies (\u01eb \u03c0 = 115 GeV and \u01eb K = 850 GeV, defined as those energies for which meson decay and interaction rates in the atmosphere where muons originate are equal) [1] and for the more complex effect in the MINOS FD where the energies are above \u01eb \u03c0 and comparable to \u01eb K . Mesons which are much below their critical energies mostly decay, so the temperature effect that does exist to increase the decay rate in the summer has a large effect on decreasing the interaction rate in the summer. This is the situation for muons in the ND where the threshold from the overburden is near 50 GeV. At the FD, where the threshold is almost a TeV, a change in the decay rate has a smaller impact on the interaction rate, since a large fraction of the hadrons are interacting before they decay.",

This transition occurs at track separations of about 5-8 m.",

One explanation is favored: this is a hypothesis in which multiple muons come preferentially from higher energy pions and kaons which, in the summer, are less likely to interact and produce the secondary pions and kaons that give rise to the multiple muons. However, a full explanation of our observations including the dependence in the FD on track separation must come from a more detailed study of extensive air-shower properties and the properties of the atmosphere.",
