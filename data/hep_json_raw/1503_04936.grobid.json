The geometric acceptance of the ATLAS forward proton detectors: ALFA and AFP for various LHC optics settings is shown. The probabilities of observing a proton originating from a minimum-bias event in ALFA and AFP stations are given. The main properties of single diffractive and double Pomeron exchange production of dijets, photon+jet, jet-gap-jet and W/Z bosons are discussed. The possibility of measuring the jet production in exclusive (double proton tag) and semi-exclusive (single tag) mode is evaluated.",

This is also true for the LHC, where a large community works on both theoretical and experimental aspects of diffraction. Despite these researches, there is no clear definition of what diffraction is. Usually, it is connected to the exchange of a colourless object, i.e. such an interaction could be mediated by electromagnetic (photon exchange) or strong (Pomeron exchange) force. A colourless exchange may lead to one of the most prominent features of diffraction -the presence of rapidity gap. Moreover, since the colourless exchange does not influence the quantum numbers, the nature of interacting objects does not change. For example, if a colourless object is exchanged by colliding protons, they may stay intact, lose part of their energy and be scattered at very small angles (typically into the accelerator beam pipe).",

Scattered protons can be measured in TOTEM Roman pot stations. Recently, there are 8 Roman pot units placed symmetrically w.r.t. the Interaction Point. The first two stations are placed around 147 m, whereas the others are located around 220 m. Each unit consists of three pots, two approaching the beam vertically and one horizontally. In addition, an upgrade called CT-PPS was proposed. This project assumes the installation of additional four units at about 200 m from IP.

Depending on the momen-tum lost in the interaction, the emitting proton may remain intact and be detected by a forward proton detector. However, it should be stressed that additional soft interactions between the protons or the proton and the final state particles can destroy the diffractive signature. This effect decreases the cross-section for the process with intact protons and is quantified by a factor called the gap survival probability. For the hard single diffractive events at \u221a s = 13 TeV this factor is estimated to be of about 0.1 [11].",

Across the gap, an object exchanged in the t-channel is the colour singlet and carries a large momentum transfer (see Fig. 6 (a)). When the rapidity gap is sufficiently large, the perturbative QCD description of jetgap-jet events is performed in terms of a Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron [15]. The jet-gap-jet topology can also be produced in SD and DPE process (cf. Fig. 6 (b)). In such cases the rapidity gaps are easier to be identified [16]. A search for the events with no activity between the jets was performed using the ATLAS and CMS detectors [17]. The applied method assumed vetoing on the additional jets (with the minimal transverse momentum of p min T > 20 GeV) in the central region. As was argued in [18], such an approach may not be valid to study the BFKL effects since the veto threshold was too high. In [10], a method based on track veto was discussed and shown to be applicable -the distribution of the gap size cannot be properly described without a contribution coming from jet-gap-jet events.",

The impact of the ND background on the measurement depends on the success of the data-driven methods using the control regions.

The identification method based on the large rapidity gap recognition can be used by all big LHC experiments. Moreover, as ATLAS and CMS/TOTEM are equipped with the set of forward detectors, it is possible to use the proton tagging technique. The geometric acceptance of the forward proton taggers is complementary -it allows them to measure protons which have lost up to 17% of their initial energy and have a transverse momentum smaller than 3 GeV. This will allow soft and hard diffractive events to be studied.",

Apart from obtaining information about the cross-section for these processes, the measurements will allow to shed a light on some interesting diffractive features. For example, the survival probability for single diffractive and double Pomeron exchange processes can be determined. Since the theoretical predictions significantly differ, such a measurement will deliver an opportunity to constrain them. Moreover, a quark and gluon fraction of the Pomeron can be obtained. This will not only allow to gain knowledge about its structure, but also to test the universality between electron-proton and proton-proton experiments. In addition, by studying properties of diffractive events with protons being measured, various theories can be tested. For example, by looking at the properties of the jet-gapjet production one can check the predictions of the BFKL model.",
