Together with constraints from B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 , the results are used to constrain additional contributions due to penguin diagrams in the CP -violating phase \u03c6 s , measured through B 0 s decays to charmonium.",

            "text": ", where V ij are elements of the CKM matrix [1]. The phase \u03c6 s is a sensitive probe of dynamics beyond the SM (BSM) since it has a very small theoretical uncertainty and BSM processes can contribute to B 0 s -B 0 s mixing [2][3][4][5]. Global fits to experimental data, excluding the direct measurements of \u03c6 s , give \u22122\u03b2 s = \u22120.0363 \u00b1 0.0013 rad [6]. The current world average value is \u03c6 s = \u22120.015 \u00b1 0.035 rad [7], dominated by the LHCb measurement reported in ref. [8]. In the SM expectation of \u03c6 s [6], additional contributions to the leading b \u2192 ccs tree Feynman diagram, as shown in figure 1, are assumed to be negligible. However, the shift in \u03c6 s due to these contributions, called hereafter \"penguin pollution\", is difficult to compute due to the non-perturbative nature of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes involved. This penguin pollution must be measured or limited before using the \u03c6 s measurement in searches for BSM effects, since a shift in this phase caused by penguin diagrams is possible. Various methods to address this problem have been proposed [9][10][11][12][13][14], and LHCb has recently published upper limits on the size of the penguin-induced phase shift using B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 decays [15].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.

All charged particles are required to have a transverse momentum in excess of 0.5 GeV/c 2 and to be positively identified as muons, kaons or pions. The tracks are fitted to a common vertex which is required to be of good quality and significantly displaced from any PV in the event. The flight direction can be described as a vector between the B 0 s production and decay vertices; the cosine of the angle between this vector and the B 0 s momentum vector is required to be greater than 0.999.

The data sample used to train the BDTG uses less stringent particle identification requirements. When training the BDTG, simulated B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 events are used to represent the signal, while candidates reconstructed from data events with J/\u03c8 K \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant mass above 5401 MeV/c 2 are used to represent the background.

It is therefore not possible to separate such background from signal using information based solely on the invariant mass of the J/\u03c8 K \u2212 \u03c0 + system. Moreover the shape of the reflected invariant mass distribution is sensitive to the daughter particles momenta. Due to these correlations it is difficult to add the b-hadron to J/\u03c8 h + h \u2212 (where h is either a pion, a kaon or a proton) misidentified backgrounds as extra modes to the fit to the invariant mass distribution. Instead, simulated events are added to the data sample with negative weights in order to cancel the contribution from those peaking backgrounds, as done previously in ref. [8]. Simulated b-hadron to J/\u03c8 h + h \u2212 events are generated using a phase-space model, and then weighted on an event-by-event basis using the latest amplitude analyses of the decays 33], and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [34].

The effect of this correction is below one standard deviation for all the normalisation weights except for the (S0) weight. This is expected due to the rapid efficiency drop close to cos \u03b8 K = 1 which directly impacts the (S0) weight. At each step of this procedure the simulation sample is corrected both for the absence of an S-wave component and for the imperfections in the detector simulation. For the first correction, the angular fit result to data is used, whereas for the second the kaon and muon track momentum distributions of data are used.
