Results over the last decade have placed stringent bounds on the parameter space of physics beyond the Standard Model. Early results from the LHC, and its dedicated flavour factory LHCb, have further tightened these constraints and reiterate the ongoing relevance of flavour studies. The experimental status of flavour observables in the charm and beauty sectors is reviewed in measurements of CP violation, neutral meson mixing, and measurements of rare decays.",

The kaon system is an excellent example how the interplay of meson anti-meson mixing [1][2][3], and the search for rare decays [4,5] led to the prediction of the charm quark and indeed charm mesons [6][7][8][9][10]. Furthermore, the observation of CP violation in neutral kaons [11] led to the prediction of a third generation of quarks [12]. At the LHC, precision measurements of flavour physics are sensitive to new particles contributing to quantum loops up to scales of about 200 TeV [13] which, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [14], correspond to distance scales of the order of 10 \u221221 m. This exceeds the reach for direct production of particles by roughly two orders of magnitude.",

In general, CP symmetry is violated if \u03bb f , as defined in Eq. 2, deviates from 1. This can have different origins: the case |q/p| = 1 is called CP violation in mixing, |\u0100 f /A f | = 1 is CP violation in the decay, and a non-zero phase \u03c6 between q/p and\u0100 f /A f causes CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay. Mixing is common to all decay modes and hence CP violation originating in this process is universal which is called indirect CP violation. Decay-specific CP violation is called direct CP violation. An excellent discussion on the different types of CP violation can be found in Sect. 7.2.1 of [16]. As opposed to the strange and the beauty system, CP violation has not yet been discovered in the charm system, though the LHCb collaboration has recently found first evidence for CP violation in two-body D 0 decays [17].",

Tagging the flavour at production usually exploits the strong decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , where the charge of the pion determines the flavour of the D 0 . Charge conjugate decays are implicitly included here and henceforth. The small amount of free energy in this decay leads to the difference in the reconstructed invariant mass of the D * + and the D 0 , \u03b4m \u2261 m D * + \u2212 m D 0 , exhibiting a sharply peaking structure over a threshold function as background. An alternative to using this decay mode is tagging the D 0 flavour by reconstructing a flavour-specific decay of a B meson. This method has not yet been used in a measurement as it did not yet yield competitive quantities of tagged D 0 mesons. At LHCb this approach may be of interest due to differences in trigger efficiencies partly compensating for lower production rates. Another option available, particularly at e + e \u2212 colliders, is the reconstruction of the opposite side charm meson in a flavour specific decay.",

This require the decay-time dependence of the phase space structure of these decays, which is possible in two ways: using Dalitz plot models or based on a measurement of the strong phase difference across the Dalitz plot by the CLEO collaboration [45]. One measurement made by the Bellecollaboration has determined these parameters based on a Dalitz plot model [46]. Other measurements were performed by the CLEO [47] and BaBar [48] collaborations assuming CP conservation and thus extracting only x and y. With the data samples available and being recorded at LHCb and those expected at future flavour factories, these measurements will be very important to understand charm mixing and CP violation. However, in order to avoid systematic limitations it will be important to reduce model uncertainties or to improve model-independent strong phase difference measurements, which is possible at BESIII.",

[38] While it was commonly stated in literature that CP violation effects in these channels were not expected to exceed 10 \u22123 , this statement has been revisited in numerous recent publications. To date, no clear understanding of whether [52][53][54][55] or not [44,[56][57][58] CP violation of this level can be accommodated within the SM has emerged. In parallel with attempts to improve the SM calculations, many estimates of potential effects of PBSM have been made [44,53,56,[59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68]. To complement theoretical calculations, measurements in related modes have been and will be performed in order to single out effects from particular amplitudes.",

            "text": "A related way of searching for CP violation is using decays of charged D mesons. One group of measurements studies decays of D + and D + s mesons into three charged hadrons, namely pions or kaons. Here, CP violation can occur in two-body resonances contributing to these decay amplitudes. Asymmetries in the Dalitz-plot substructure can be measured using an amplitude model or using model-independent statistical analyses [69,70]. The latter allow CP asymmetries to be discovered while eventually a model-dependent analysis is required to identify its source. Neither phase-space integrated asymmetry measurements [71][72][73][74][75][76], nor searches for local asymmetries in the Dalitz plot [73,75,[77][78][79]  Decays of D + and D + s into a K 0 S and either a K + or a \u03c0 + are closely related to their D 0 counterparts. Measurements of time-integrated asymmetries in these decays are expected to exhibit a contribution from CP violation in the kaon system. As pointed out recently [80] this contribution depends on the decay-time acceptance of the K 0 S . This can lead to different expected values for different experiments which so far has not been taken into account. Measurements of asymmetries in the decays 76,81] show significant asymmetries. Future, more precise measurements will reveal whether or not these are in agreement with the expected contribution from the kaon system.",

However, both B-factory measurements in b \u2192 s penguin modes [105][106][107][108][109][110], as well as the recent LHCb measurements of B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 , find roughly equal longitudinal and CP-odd transverse polarization components. Proposed explanations have included large penguin annihilation contributions [111] or final state interactions [112]. The time dependent CP violation measurements in both these modes should become experimentally accessible in the near future, further constraining PBSM.",

In this respect \u03b3 can be measured either from tree-level or loop-mediated processes, and a comparison of the two kinds of measurements provides another opportunity for PBSM to manifest itself. In either case, \u03b3 is experimentally determined from a measurement of CP violation in those B meson decays where diagrams involving |V ub | and |V cb | result in the same final state. The determination of \u03b3 from tree-level decays is one of the most sensitive tests of the SM precisely because the associated theoretical uncertainties are confined to electroweak corrections associated with box-diagram decays, and are at the level of \u03b4\u03b3 /\u03b3 \u2248 10 \u22126 [144]. Experimentally the challenge is that the sensitivity to \u03b3 comes from the interference of |V ub | and |V cb | diagrams, which means that the final state must be carefully chosen in order to make the amplitudes of similar size and hence maximize the interference. Unfortunately those modes which have the highest interference also have the biggest associated experimental difficulties, whether it be low overall branching ratios, difficult to reconstruct final state particles, or the requirement for a timedependent analysis. This means that the ultimate precision on \u03b3 can only be achieved by combining several different measurements.",

The Fig. 5 Present limits on B(B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) at 95 % CL set by the experiments D0 [181], CDF [182], ATLAS [183], CMS [184] and LHCb [185]. The SM prediction is indicated by the blue-dashed line (Color figure online) two decays B s,d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 have a clear experimental signature and are easier to reconstruct and identify than the other leptonic decays of B-mesons. Their branching fractions are predicted to be B(B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (3.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22129 and B(B d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (1.0 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10 \u221210 in the SM [178,179]. Contributions from PBSM, especially in models with an extended Higgs sector, can enhance these branching fractions. For instance, in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM the branching fraction of the decay B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 is proportional to the sixth power of tan \u03b2 (the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the Higgs fields H u and H d ) [180]. This fact makes this observable particularly sensitive to supersymmetric models with large tan \u03b2. More generally measurements of this branching fractions probe the Wilson coefficients C s and C p , which are negligibly small in the SM. Present measurements of B(B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) are shown in Fig. 5.",

This analysis profits from the good momentum resolution and the good particle identification performances of LHCb to reject the different sources of background. The branching fraction of the signal was extracted by using the three normalization channels: B + \u2192 J /\u03c8K + , B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6. For the first two of these channels, the ratio of the hadronization fractions f s f d is needed. 1 This variable was measured at LHCb by combining measurements with semi-leptonic and hadronic decays [186]: f s /f d = 0.267 +0.021 \u22120.020 [187,188]. The uncertainty on this parameter is, in the long run, a limiting systematic uncertainty for discriminating between SM and BSM contributions in the B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay, as well as for the measurement of the golden ratio B(B s \u2192\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) [189]. The correlation between the branching fractions of the decays B s,d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 is shown in Fig. 6 for several beyond SM scenarios. The upper limits set by LHCb for the B s,d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays are: B(B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 and B(B d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 1.05 \u00d7 10 \u22129 at 95 % CL and are illustrated in Fig. 6 by the shaded region. These measure- Fig. 6 Correlation for the branching fractions of the decays B s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B d \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 for several models of PBSM. Details on the models can be found in [190]. The recent upper limits by LHCb are shown by the shaded region.

These observables include the forward-backward asymmetry of the dimuon system, A FB , the fraction of K * longitudinal polarization, F L , the transverse asymmetry, S 3 [193] (often referred to as 1 2 (1 \u2212 F L )A 2 T in the literature [194]), and the CP averaged A I m , S 9 [195]. They can be extracted by performing an angular analysis as a function of the dimuon invariant mass squared, q 2 , with respect to the following angles: the angle \u03b8 l between the \u03bc + (\u03bc \u2212 ) and the B 0 (B 0 ) in the dimuon rest frame; the angle \u03b8 K between the kaon and B 0 in the K * rest frame; and the angle \u03c6 between the planes of the dimuon system and the plane of the K * . A formal definition of these angles can be found in [196]. It should be noticed that the definition of the angles varies in the literature. In particular the sign of the \u03c6 angle in LHCb is opposite that of CDF for the B 0 decay. Consequently in place of A I m in Fig. 7 The A FB , F L , S 3 and S 9 measured by the experiments BaBar [198], Belle [199], CDF [200] and LHCb [197]. The comparison with the SM prediction, taken from [201] is also shown. Reproduced from [197] the angular distribution LHCb is sensitive to the CP-average S 9 , whereas CDF is sensitive to the asymmetry A 9 . Present measurements of the observables A FB , F L , S 3 and S 9 are shown in Fig. 7. These measurements provide information about the Wilson coefficients C 7 , C 9 and C 10 and on their right-handed counterparts. The LHCb experiment has recently made the world's best measurements on these angular observables [197]. The physics parameters were extracted by fitting the partial decay rate as a function of the three angles for different bins in q 2 . In order to reduce the number of parameters in the fit, due to the small size of the data sample, the angle \u03c6 was folded by taking \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u03c0 when \u03c6 < 0. This transformation cancels out the terms containing cos \u03c6 and sin \u03c6 in the differential decay rate. This strategy is different from that followed by other experiments, where only projections of the angular distributions were used.",

These searches have been performed by several experiments. A complete discussion of LFV searches goes beyond the scope of this review. Decays of the type B + \u2192 h \u2212 l + l + , where h \u2212 is a meson, can be considered the analogues of neutrinoless double \u03b2 decays and can be used to search for heavy Majorana neutrinos [209][210][211][212]. These searches have been performed by the LHCb [213,214], BaBar [215], Belle [216] and CLEO [217] experiments. Upper limits for these decays are summarised in Table 1. Heavy Majorana neutrinos can also be searched for by using the corresponding charm decays D + \u2192 h \u2212 l + l + .

In particular, the observation of permillelevel CP violation in D 0 decays, the large dimuon asymmetry in B 0 and B 0 s decays, as well as the values of sin(2\u03b2) and the branching ratio of B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd, are difficult to simultaneously interpret within the Standard Model framework. At the same time, measurements of rare decays such as B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 which are in good agreement with the Standard Model have placed the most stringent limits yet on many Standard Model extensions. What this contradiction highlights is the ongoing relevance of flavour physics as key tool not only for the indirect discovery of new particles and processes, but also for discriminating between the many proposed theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. With the excellent performance of the LHC, and the wealth of precision flavour measurements coming from its detectors, it is reasonable to hope for a deepening, and eventual resolution, of these contradictions in the years to come.",
