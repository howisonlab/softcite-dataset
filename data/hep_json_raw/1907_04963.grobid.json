            "text": "There is a long standing debate about whether or not the annual modulation signal reported by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration is induced by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) in the galaxy's dark matter halo scattering from nuclides in their NaI(Tl) crystal target/detector. This is because regions of WIMP-mass vs. WIMP-nucleon cross-section parameter space that can accommodate the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 modulation signal in the context of the standard WIMP dark matter galactic halo and isospin-conserving (canonical), spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon interactions have been excluded by the COSINE-100 experiment that uses the same NaI(Tl) target/detector material. Moreover, the recently released DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 results are inconsistent with an interpretation as WIMP-nuclide scattering via the canonical SI interaction and prefer, instead, isospin-violating or spin-dependent interactions. Dark matter interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA signal are sensitive to the NaI(Tl) scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils, which is characterized by so-called quenching factors (QF), and the QF values used in previous studies differ significantly from recently reported measurements, which may have led to incorrect characterizations of the DAMA/LIBRA signal. In this article, the compatibility of the DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE-100 results, in light of the new QF measurements is examined for different possible types of WIMP-nucleon interactions. The resulting allowed parameter space regions associated with the DAMA/LIBRA signal are explicitly compared with 90% confidence level upper limits from the initial 59.5 day COSINE-100 exposure. With the newly measured QF values, the allowed 3\u03c3 regions from the DAMA/LIBRA data are still generally excluded by the COSINE-100 data.",

Although this signal has persisted throughout more than 20 years of investigation [7][8][9][10][11], its interpretation as being due to WIMP-nucleus scattering in the specific context of the standard galactic WIMP halo model [12,13], has been the subject of a continuing debate. This is because the WIMP-nucleon cross sections inferred from the DAMA/LIBRA modulation are in conflict with limits from other experiments that directly measure the total, time integrated rate of nuclear recoils [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. An unambiguous verification of the DAMA/LIBRA signal by independent experiments using the same NaI(Tl) crystal target material is mandatory. Experimental efforts by several groups using the same NaI(Tl) target medium are currently underway [23][24][25][26][27][28].",

Each crystal is coupled to two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to measure the amount of deposited energy in the crystal. The crystal assemblies are immersed in 2,200 L of liquid scintillator, which allows for the identification and subsequent reduction of radioactive backgrounds observed in the crystals [30]. The liquid scintillator is surrounded by copper, lead, and plastic scintillators to reduce the background contribution from external radiation as well as tag cosmic-ray muons that transit the apparatus [31].",

Even though DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE-100 use the same NaI(Tl) target, there are differences. The DAMA/LIBRA signal is an annual modulation effect while the COSINE-100 result is based on the time averaged spectral shape [34]. Although the first modulation measurements from ANAIS-112 [35] and COSINE-100 [36] were recently released, both experiments still need a few more years of exposure to reach a modulation sensitivity that is sufficient to probe the DAMA/LIBRA signal directly [25,27].",

This is especially the case for the time-averaged NaI(Tl) results from COSINE-100. While the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 results used a 2 keVee (electron equivalent energy) energy threshold, the recent phase2 result has a lower threshold of 1 keVee [11]. The new low-threshold energy signal has a significantly worse goodness-of-fit for the canonical SI scattering scenario [37][38][39], suggesting that an isospin-violating model in which the WIMP-proton coupling is different from the WIMP-neutron coupling, or a spin-dependent (SD) interaction model are better suited for WIMP dark matter interpretations of the sig-nal.",

            "text": "One noticeable issue with the interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA obervation in terms of WIMP-nucleon interactions is the value of the nuclear-recoil quenching factor (QF). Quenching factors are the scintillation light yields for sodium and iodine recoils relative to those for \u03b3/electron-induced radiation of the same energy. Most previous studies have used QF values reported by the DAMA/NaI collaboration in 1996 [40] (subsequently referred to as DAMA QF values), that were obtained by measuring the response of NaI(Tl) crystals to nuclear recoils induced by neutrons from a 252 Cf source. The measured responses are compared with the simulated neutron energy spectrum to obtain QF values with the assumption that they are independent of the energy of the recoiling nuclide: for sodium recoil energies between 6.4 and 97 keVnr (nuclear recoil energy), QF Na =0.30\u00b10.01; for iodine recoil energies between 22 and 330 keVnr, QF I =0.09\u00b10.01 [40]. Recently, results from more refined methods for measuring NaI(Tl) QF values that use monochromatic neutron beams have been reported [41][42][43][44]. In these measurements, the detection of an elastically scattered neutron at a fixed angle relative to the incoming neutron beam direction provides an unambiguous knowledge of the energy transferred to the target nuclide. The QF values from these recent determinations differ significantly from the 1996 DAMA QF results, as shown in Fig. 1.",

The allowed regions from the DAMA/LIBRA data are explicitly compared with the 90% confidence level (CL) limits estimated from the 59.5 day COSINE-100 exposure [32]. For comparison, the same data are interpreted using the DAMA QF values. For all of the WIMP-nucleon interactions considered here, we find that the COSINE-100 data excludes the 3\u03c3 allowed regions associated with the DAMA/LIBRA data in the context of the standard WIMP galactic halo model.",

Interestingly, all of the recent measurements show an increasing behavior with QF Na with increasing recoil energy. This behavior is also observed in liquid xenon [46] and is well explained by the Lindhard model [45]. We fit the three new measurements with a modified version of the Lindhard model (see Appendix); as shown in Fig. 1, the three sets of measurements can be well fit by the model. Even though the new measurements have consistent energy dependence and lower QF values than those measured by DAMA, there are some mutual differences. These may be due to different environmental conditions, analysis methods (including different charge integration windows), and different tallium doping concentration of the crystals used for the measurements. In applying these new QF values to the DAMA/LIBRA data, we consider these variations as a source of systematic uncertainty. The Joo et al. [44] results are taken as the central value with allowed systematical variations that span the range between the Xu et al. [42] and Collar [41] measurements (see Appendix). Figure 1 shows the three new QF measurement sets, each with its own fit based on the modified Lindhard model. Because of the fast increase of QF Na in the Collar measurements at energies higher than 19.6 keVnr, the lower bound of systematic uncertainties, denoted by a blue solid line in Fig. 1 (a), was taken to be the difference between the Xu et al. and Joo et al. measurements. In the case of the COSINE-100 data, the Joo et al. results were used because these measurements used a crystal from the same ingot, the same data aquisition system [47], and the same analysis framework as the COSINE-100 experimental data.",

To obtain allowed regions in the WIMP mass vs. WIMP-proton cross-section parameter space, we implement a maximum likelihood method based on the likelihood ratio to fit for mass and cross section values. Confidence regions in these parameters are determined by examining variations of the likelihood values from their maxima (see Appendix).",

On the other hand, the observed DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 modulation data does not provide a good fit to the expectations for this model [37][38][39]. Switching to the new QF values for both the phase1 and phase2 data does not improve the phase2 data's agreement with the model, as shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I. As discussed in Ref. [37], modulation amplitude in the low-WIMP-mass allowed region, which is dominated by WIMP-sodium scattering, is expected to increase rapidly for recoil energies below 1.5 keVee because of the onset of contributions from WIMP-iodine scattering. On the other hand, modulation amplitude in the the high-WIMP-mass allowed region, which is dominated by WIMP-iodine scattering, is expected to decrease at energies below 1.5 keVee. Since the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 data displays a modulation amplitude that smoothly increases with energy below 1.5 keVee, the canonical SI WIMP interaction cannot provide a good fit to the phase2 data. We, therefore, only use the phase1 data for the interpretation of the canonical SI WIMP scattering with the new QF values. As shown in Fig. 3  values for both the allowed WIMP masses and WIMPnucleon cross-sections. We find that the local minimum value of chi-squared with the new QF values in the lowmass region increases somewhat, while the chi-squared value for the high-mass region decreases, as summarized in Table I.",

This can be accomplished if the WIMPproton coupling is different from the WIMP-neutron coupling (isospin violating interaction) [37,38]. (Sodium has nearly equal numbers of protons (11) and neutrons (12); iodine has 74 neutrons and 53 protons.) In this case, three parameters are used to fit the DAMA/LIBRA data: the WIMP mass, the WIMP-proton scattering cross-section, and the ratio between the effective coupling of WIMPs to neutrons and to protons (f n /f p ). Figure 4 shows the 3\u03c3-allowed WIMP mass vs. crosssections regions for the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1+phase2 data with the new QF values for the best fit values of f n /f p = \u22120.758 in the low-mass and f n /f p = \u22120.712 in the high-mass regions. The low-mass and high-mass local minima are significantly shifted with respect to the results using the DAMA QF values. The minimum chisquared values with the new QF values, listed in Table I, indicate that this model provides a good description of the full DAMA/LIBRA-phase1+phase2 data set.",

[50][51][52] to estimate the DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions for spin-dependent (SD) interactions using the publicly available dmdd package [53,54]. In the fit to the DAMA/LIBRA data, we vary two parameters: the WIMP-mass and the WIMPproton SD interaction cross section. Here we do not include WIMP-neutron SD interactions because the even number of neutrons in both sodium and iodine suppresses the expected signal significantly while the odd number of protons in both elements make them more sensitive to WIMP-proton SD interactions. For the DAMA/LIBRA data, two local minima are obtained with the new QF values for the SD WIMP-proton interaction, while only a low-mass WIMP has a good fit for the DAMA QF values as shown in Fig. 5. However, the chi-squared value of the best fit using the new QF values is slightly worse, as shown in Table I. In the high-mass region, the relatively large chi-squared value with the new QF values corresponds to a similar trend seen in the fit that uses The 3\u03c3 allowed regions of the WIMP mass and the WIMP-proton cross-section associated with the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 data (blue solid contours) are compared with the 90% CL upper limit from the COSINE-100 data (black solid line) with the new QF values. To illustrate the effects of the QF changes, we present the 3\u03c3 regions of the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 data (blue dotted contours) and 90% CL limit of the COSINE-100 data (black dotted line) using the DAMA QF values (from Ref.

We find that the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 data are not compatible with canonical SI WIMP interaction in the context of the standard WIMP galactic halo model using the new QF values. Moreover, the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 data only are well fitted but with significant shifts in both the allowed WIMP-mass and WIMP-nucleon cross-section values. We successfully obtained allowed regions from the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1+phase2 data for an isospin-violating interaction hypothesis, as well as for spin-dependent WIMP-proton interactions with the new QF values. However, for all the WIMP-dark matter interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA data considered here, the COSINE-100 limits based on the initial 59.5 days' exposure exclude the 3\u03c3 allowed regions for the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at the 90% CL. Because the COSINE-100 experiment uses the same NaI(Tl) target medium as the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, this result strongly constrains models that purport to explain the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal as being due to interactions of WIMPs in the galactic dark matter halo with nuclides in NaI(Tl) crystal detectors.    Here we present the fit results based on both the DAMA and new QF values. The first and second groups of rows are for the canonical SI interaction using the phase1 and phase2 data, respectively. The third and fourth groups, using the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1+phase2 data, are for the isospin-violating SI interaction and the SD proton couplings, respectively. The canonical SI interaction for the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 data does not provide a good fit, while for the other cases good fits are obtained.",

The generalized spin-independent response (the M operator in Table 1 of Ref [50]) is used for both the canonical and the isospin-violating SI interactions. For isospinviolating SI interactions, the WIMP-nucleon coupling coefficient ratio, f n /f p is floated. The two spin-dependent response operators (\u03a3 \u2032 and \u03a3 \u2032\u2032 ) from the same table) are used for SD interactions. These nuclear responses, including form factors, are implemented using the publically available dmdd package [53]. We subsequently apply the quenching factors and smearing (resolution) effects to the differential nuclear recoil rate dR/dE nr to obtain the expected differential rate, dR/dE ee .
