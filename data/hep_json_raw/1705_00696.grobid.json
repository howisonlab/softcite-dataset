One proposed model with \u2206(B \u2212 L) = 2 involves the oscillations of a neutron to an antineutron. In this paper a new limit on this process is derived for the data acquired from all three operational phases of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment. The search was concentrated in oscillations occurring within the deuteron, and 23 events are observed against a background expectation of 30.5 events. These translate to a lower limit on the nuclear lifetime of 1.48\u00d710 31 years at 90% confidence level (CL) when no restriction is placed on the signal likelihood space (unbounded). Alternatively, a lower limit on the nuclear lifetime was found to be 1.18 \u00d7 10 31 years at 90% CL when the signal was forced into a positive likelihood space (bounded). Values for the free oscillation time derived from various models are also provided in this article. This is the first search for neutron-antineutron oscillation with the deuteron as a target.",

In intra-nuclear experiments, the rate reduction due to the suppression factor needs to be offset by the exposure to a large quantity of bound neutrons, requiring kiloton scale experiments. The suppression factor varies for different nuclei and can be derived from theoretical models [3]. In fact, measurements of intranuclear oscillation and free neutronantineutron oscillations are complementary. There are scenarios where the rate of oscillations can either be suppressed in the nuclei to a lower or higher degree relative to the expected free oscillation rate, due simply to the nuclear suppression factor [4]. There are also scenarios (such as the presence of an effective mass difference between the neutron and antineutron or Lorentz symmetry violation) where the observation of free oscillations may not be possible while oscillations in nuclei can be ob-served [5]. The magnitude of this suppression is proportional to the potential energy of the neutron inside the nucleus. Since the SNO experiment was filled with heavy water ( 2 H 2 O, denoted as D 2 O hereafter), the deuteron ( 2 H) is an intra-nuclear source for neutron-antineutron oscillations, and has a lower suppression factor compared to oxygen by a factor of four on average [6].",

The experiment took data between November 2, 1999 andNovember 28, 2006. It consisted of 1000 metric tons (tonnes) of 99.92% isotopically pure D 2 O, contained in a 12-meter-diameter spherical acrylic vessel. This vessel was surrounded by 9456 20-cm Hamamatsu R1408 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which were installed on an 18 m diameter geodesic structure (PSUP). It is useful in this analysis to define the radius from the center of the detector to the front-face of the PMTs, R PMT = 830 cm. A light concentrator [12] was mounted in front of each PMT to give a total photocathode coverage of nearly 55% of 4\u03c0. The acrylic vessel was surrounded by 7.4 kilotonnes of ultra pure H 2 O. The acrylic vessel had a cylindrical section at the top, referred to as the neck, to allow deployment of calibration sources.",

In Phase II, two tons of NaCl were added to the D 2 O, which enhanced the efficiency of detecting the neutrons from NC interactions via radiative captures in 35 Cl [15]. In Phase III, an array of proportional counters was deployed in D 2 O [16,17]. The proportional counters were constructed of approximately 2-m long high purity nickel tubes welded together to form longer strings. The array consisted of 36 strings filled with 3 He, and an additional 4 strings filled with 4 He that were insensitive to the neutron signals and were used for background studies.",

A suppression factor for 56 Fe was also evaluated to be a factor of 2 lower than Dover et al. These newer suppression factors improved both the Super-Kamiokande and the Soudan II experimental lower limits. The suppression factor in the deuteron was not re-evaluated in their study due to inadequacy of the optical-potential approach for the deuteron [21].",

The first parameter is the number of detected Cherenkov rings, N rings , and the other is an isotropy estimator for multiple-ring events. These two parameters are efficient in isolating n-n's multiple-pion signal from atmospheric neutrino backgrounds. Figure 8 shows the expected N rings distributions for the atmospheric background and the n-n signal compared to the data. Two additional ring selection conditions are applied. The first condition eliminates rings whose tracks are too close to one another. In multiple-ring event candidates, the ring with the lowest \u22122 ln \u03bb (Eqn. 7) is kept. At cos \u03b8 ring < 0.86 two distinctive rings could be separated, where cos \u03b8 ring is the angle between the tracks of two reconstructed rings. The second condition eliminates rings that are too small due to false reconstruction from the fitter, as described in Sec. V.1, by imposing the criterion of x \u2032 rec < 350 cm. There is good agreement between data and the atmospheric neutrino expectation for this analysis parameter. The analysis is further refined by taking advantage of the isotropic nature of n-n interactions. An energydependent isotropy selection is applied to multiple-ring events such that \u039b < m m \u2022p.e.+b m , where p.e. is the number of detected photoelectrons, and m m and b m are parameters derived from simulations.

The blue ring is the primary ring, ring with the best reconstruction (i.e. minimum of \u22122 ln \u03bb\u03b1 in Eqn. 7), while the red is the secondary ring. This secondary ring is a MRF flaw in handling low statistics of triggered PMTs if the local vertex (x \u2032 rec\u00fbrec ) is near the acrylic vessel. This pathology appears when the reconstruction of the local vertex from the origin is x \u2032 rec > 350 cm along the track.",
