We also present first evidence for the production of the neutral member of this isospin triplet, Z 0 c (3900) decaying into \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 at a 3.5\u03c3 significance level.",

This is an important finding because a charged hadron decaying into a charmonium state plus a charged meson must contain at least four quarks. If confirmed, this observation would herald the possible existence of a family of other charged states in this mass region. Several charged hadrons were reported earlier by Belle in the charmonium and the bottomonium regions [3], but not all have been independently confirmed, and some remain controversial.",

The Belle observation [2] was also made at Y(4260), which was populated by initial state radiation from 967 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilations at the \u03a5(nS ) resonances. Clearly, it is very important to make an independent confirmation of the existence of Z \u00b1 c (3900), and to also determine if it is populated in e + e \u2212 annihilation at a resonance which, unlike Y(4260), has well established charmonium credentials, such as \u03c8(4160), the 2 3 D 1 state of charmonium.",

The peak at M max (\u03c0 0 J/\u03c8) \u2248 3900 MeV is seen in Fig. 4(a) for events with all M 2 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ), but it is much more clearly delineated in Fig. 4(b) for M 2 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) < 0.65 GeV 2 because of a nearly factor two smaller background. Fig. 4(c) shows that there is no evidence for a peak anywhere for M 2 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) > 0.65 GeV 2 . We fit the M max (\u03c0 0 J/\u03c8) distribution in Fig. 4(b) in exactly the same manner as the M max (\u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8) distributions in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), with phase space background, and peak shape obtained by convolving the MC determined instrumental peak shape, with width of 5. f. = 13/20. The large values of the width and its error indicate that with the small event statistics it is not advisible to keep all three parameters free. We therefore fix the width \u0393(Z 0 c ) = 37 MeV, as determined for Z \u00b1 c , and include its uncertainty of \u00b113 MeV as a source of systematic error. For the corresponding fit, shown in Fig. 4(b), the results are N(Z 0 c ) = 25 \u00b1 7 counts, M(Z 0 c ) = 3904 \u00b1 9(stat) MeV, \u0393(Z 0 c ) = 37(fixed) MeV, as also listed in Table II.

Our M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution is nearly flat with a small enhancement corresponding to f 0 (980), whereas the M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distributions observed by both BES III and Belle show a large enhancement due to f 0 (980) and a deep minimum at M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2248 550 MeV. This difference indicates that our observations are characteristic of the decay of \u03c8(4160), and are not due to any substantial contribution from the tail of Y(4260).",
