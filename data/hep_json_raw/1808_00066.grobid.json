A GridPix detector was used to search for soft X-ray photons in the energy range from 200 eV to 10 keV from converted solar chameleons. No significant excess over the expected background has been observed in the data taken in 2014 and 2015. We set an improved limit on the chameleon photon coupling, \u03b2 \u03b3 5.7 \u00d7 10 10 for 1 < \u03b2 m < 10 6 at 95 % C.L. improving our previous results by a factor two and for the first time reaching sensitivity below the solar luminosity bound for tachocline magnetic fields up to 12.5 T.",

            "text": "Dark energy in particular, as well as the dark sector of cosmology in general, is one of today's great challenges in fundamental physics. Dark energy, needed to explain the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion, could be introduced by modifying General Relativity. This can be accomplished via a new scalar field along with a screening mechanism to avoid unnatural effects such as as the appearance of a fifth force with long range. In case of the chameleon, one of the leading candidates for dark energy, non-linear self-interaction and interactions with matter cause these particles to have an \"effective mass\" depending on the ambient mass (energy) density. This leads to the so-called chameleon screening mechanism, giving rise to the name of this dark energy candidate [1,2,3] (for a comprehensive theoretical treatment we refer to [4]). Experimental constraints on chameleon models arise e.g. from fifth force gravity experiments, atomic spectroscopy, and atom and neutron interferometry. A recent summary of experimental constraints is given in [5].",

While for chameleon production in the nuclear coulomb fields of the solar core's plasma no theoretical calculations exist up to now, one can consider regions in the solar interior featuring strong transverse magnetic fields. The tachocline, a solar region located at approximately 0.7 R , is widely believed to be a source of highly intense magnetic fields formed through differential rotation. The chameleon production in the tachocline and their propagation through the solar medium as well as their journey to an earth-based helioscope have been studied in detail in the proposal [6] and also in [7].",

If the effective mass exceeds the chameleon's energy, it cannot enter the corresponding material but is reflected off.

Also, a different technique exploiting the chameleon matter coupling by directly detecting solar chameleons focused by an X-ray telescope on a radiation pressure device [13] is pursued by CAST and its results will be published elsewhere. Here, we discuss uncertainties in the tachocline magnetic field strength, its radial position and dimension as well as the fraction of solar luminosity emitted as chameleons. We also consider different cases of the chameleon potential and show that our upper bound, \u03b2 \u03b3 5.7 \u00d7 10 10 , is almost independent of the type of inverse power law potential used.",

A crucial request for the chameleon search is a high detection efficiency for lowenergy X-ray photons. Minimizing the material in front of the sensitive detector volume is thus of high importance. Therefore, a 2 \u00b5m thick Mylar foil with a 40 nm layer of aluminum was used as entrance window and simultaneously as cathode of the drift volume. The foil was mounted on a copper strongback covering 17.4 % of the total area. To improve the vacuum in the XRT down to the required 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mbar a differential pumping scheme had to be used, requiring an additional vacuum window made of 0.9 \u00b5m of Mylar.

            "text": "In [23] three eventshape variables have been identified, which provide a good separation power to differentiate X-ray events from non-X-ray events: eccentricity (a measure for the circularity of the event), length divided by root mean square (rms) along the short axis and fraction of pixels within radius of one rms (the latter two providing handles on the shape of the distribution of pixels within the reconstructed event). From the measurements at a variable X-ray generator [23] reference distributions of these variables for eight energy ranges in the regime up to 10 keV were obtained. These are used here to compute a likelihood value for each reconstructed event based on the reference distributions of the corresponding energy range. This provides a measure of the probability (likelihood) for an X-ray, of given energy, to look like the observed event. By only keeping those events passing a certain threshold for the likelihood value, the vast majority of non-X-ray events is removed from the data set resulting in a suppression of non-X-ray-like background events. To find the optimal likelihood threshold for each energy range the same method is applied to pure X-ray calibration datasets yielding the likelihood distribution for X-ray events of each energy range. As the likelihood distributions of X-ray and background events overlap slightly, preventing a perfect separation, the likelihood threshold is found as a compromise between high background suppression on the one hand and low loss of real X-ray events on the other. Here, the likelihood thresholds for the different energy ranges are set in a way that independently of the X-ray energy 80 % of the X-ray events pass the threshold, defining a software efficiency SW = 0.8. As the chosen eventshape variables are constructed to be independent of drift properties, like diffusion constant and drift distance to avoid the necessity of e.g. a temperature compensation, an additional loose cleaning cut is required to remove those X-ray-like events which due to their size (rms value) cannot stem from X-ray conversions inside the detector. Figure 3 shows the position of events passing the likelihood based background suppression for X-ray energies up to 10 keV. Only events within a radius of 4.5 mm around the GridPix' center are fully contained on the chip with their eventshape and energy correctly reconstructed. The number of events, and therefore the background rate, is lowest in the central region. This is most likely caused by tracks only partially contained on the GridPix mimicking X-ray like, circular shaped events. Therefore two regions are defined: the gold region comprising the innermost 5 \u00d7 5 mm 2 of the chip and the silver region which is a circle of 4.5 mm radius around the chip center minus the gold region. The resulting background rates before and after application of the likelihood based background suppression method are shown in figure 4 for gold and silver region respectively. In the energy regime of 0.2 keV to 2 keV, relevant for the detection of solar chameleons, a rate of less than 10 \u22124 /keV/cm 2 /s is achieved in the gold region which corresponds to an improvement of approximately one order of magnitude compared to  ",

In figures 5 and 6 the expected background counts are compared to the observed data points for an energy range from 0.2 keV to 2 keV. Chameleons entering the evacuated cold bores of  CAST first have to pass through the sunset detectors of CAST, in particular their lead shielding. Therefore, an energy threshold of 0.2 keV has been chosen which is well above the maximum chameleon effective mass in lead (m eff = 135 eV for n = 1, \u03b2 m = 10 6 ) [9] so no absorption effects have to be taken into account. The observed counts agree with the background prediction within statistical uncertainties, no excess over the prediction is observed. Hence, an upper bound on the chameleon photon coupling \u03b2 \u03b3 can be calculated. Here, TLimit will be used for this purpose, the ROOT implementation of mclimit [25], which applies the likelihood ratio method to compute confidence levels CL b and CL s+b for the background-only and signal plus background hypotheses, respectively. The signal hypothesis is then tested using CL s = CL s+b /CL b [26].

The latter one is obtained by multiplying the solar chameleon flux with the conversion probability (1) using B = 9 T and l = 9.26 m, and shown in figure 7 for \u03b2 \u03b3 = \u03b2 sun \u03b3 . As the angular size of the solar tachocline (6.5 mrad for a sphere with a diameter of 0.7 R ) is larger than the aperture of the CAST magnet not all possible chameleon trajectories which can reach the detector through the X-ray telescope see the full length of the magnetic field. This has to be taken into account in addition to the imaging of the X-ray telescope, especially its angular behavior and its efficiency (transmission) as function of X-ray energy. The X-ray telescope's efficiency drops (approximately) linearly with the off-axis angle of an incoming X-ray beam; for X-ray energies below 2 keV the efficiency drops to 62.2 % of the on-axis value at an off-axis angle of 10 [10,27]. The geometry of the CAST magnet bore and the imaging through the X-ray telescope are modeled in a small, simplified ray-tracing simulation similar to the one used in [9]. As a result the chameleon image of the Sun as observable at the detector's position can be computed as it is shown in figure 8. The ring-like shape originates from the production in the tachocline. The gold and silver regions are indicated in the image, about a third of the flux is lost outside the silver region. Despite the higher background level the silver region still contributes to the observed upper bound on the chameleon photon coupling as it receives approximately the same flux as the gold region.",

Together with other experimental bounds, this restricts the chameleon parameter space to the region confined by 15.33 < \u03b2 m < 3.57 \u00d7 10 2 and \u03b2 \u03b3 < 5.74 \u00d7 10 10 for n = 1. This result may be further improved in the near future by a new and upgraded GridPix detector currently operated at CAST now covering a larger active area, implementing the analogue Grid signal as well as two veto scintillators which along with improved background suppression algorithms should lead to a significant reduction in background rate. Along with the first time usage of ultrathin silicon nitride windows that increase the detector's X-ray detection efficiency in the sub-keV range, this should lead to a further improved sensitivity.",
