            "text": "The \u039b 0 b baryon is the isospin singlet ground state of a bottom quark and two light quarks. The rich phenomenology associated with decays of bottom baryons allows many measurements of masses, lifetimes and branching fractions, which test the theoretical understanding of weak decays of heavy hadrons in the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) and the underlying QCD physics [1,2]. At the Tevatron, properties of the \u039b 0 b baryon, such as mass and lifetime, have been measured using two-body modes, specifically \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b 0 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 decays [3][4][5]. 1 The high production rate of b quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), along with the excellent momentum and mass resolution and the hadron identification capabilities of the LHCb detector, open up a host of multibody and Cabibbo-suppressed decay channels of \u039b 0 b baryons, e.g. the de- [7] and \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 [8]. The high signal yield of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 decay [9] allowed the precise measurement of the \u039b 0 b lifetime [10,11]. The recent analysis of this decay mode uncovered a double resonant structure in the J/\u03c8 p system consistent with two pentaquark states [12]. LHCb has also measured several B meson decays into final states with charmonia [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The first observation of \u039b 0 b decays to excited charmonium, the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u039b 0 decay, has been presented by the ATLAS collaboration [19]. An experimental investigation of other similar multibody decays of the \u039b 0 b baryon should lead to deeper insights into QCD.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data-taking. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c [22]. Large samples of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, collected concurrently with the data set, were used to calibrate the momentum scale of the spectrometer to a precision of 0.03 % [23]. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ringimaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH). Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

This effect is estimated by varying the energy loss correction in the reconstruction by 10% and taking the observed mass shift as an uncertainty. The uncertainty due to the fit model is estimated using the same set of cross-check models for the signal and background parameterization as considered in section 4, with the maximum deviation in the mass assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties on the masses of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons [36] are small and are therefore neglected. As a cross-check, the data sample is divided into four parts, for data collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8TeV and with different magnet polarities. The measured masses are consistent among these subsamples, and therefore no systematic uncertainty is assigned. To check the effect of the selection criteria (see section 3), the high-yield \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 decay channel is used.
