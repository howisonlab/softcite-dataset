The analyses use a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 4:6 fb \u00c01 collected by the ATLAS detector during the 2011 LHC data-taking period. Events are selected using leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons [W\u00f0e; \u00de and Z\u00f0e \u00fe e \u00c0 ; \u00fe \u00c0 ; \" \u00de] with the requirement of an associated isolated photon. The data are used to test the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and search for evidence for new phenomena. The measurements are used to probe the anomalous WW, ZZ, and Z triple-gauge-boson couplings and to search for the production of vector resonances decaying to Z and W. No deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed and limits are placed on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings and on the production of new vector meson resonances.",

The interactions of W and Z bosons with photons are particularly interesting as they test the self-couplings of these bosons as predicted by the non-Abelian SU\u00f02\u00de L \u00c2 U\u00f01\u00de Y gauge group of the electroweak sector. In particular, the high-energy proton-proton collisions provided by the LHC explore the production of W and Z pairs in a new energy domain. The high center-of-mass energy also allows searches for new particles, for example, techni-mesons which are predicted in technicolor models [1,2], that decay to these final states.",

            "text": "The measurements presented here are improvements on previous studies of the hadroproduction of W and Z pairs, as more precise measurements are performed with a larger data sample. The events used for the measurements were recorded in 2011 by the ATLAS detector [3] from 4:6 fb \u00c01 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The diboson candidate events are selected from the production processes pp ! ' \u00fe X (' \u00bc e, ), pp ! ' \u00fe ' \u00c0 \u00fe X, and pp ! \" \u00fe X. These final states include the production of W and Z bosons with photon bremsstrahlung from the charged leptons from the W=Z boson decays in addition to the W and Z diboson events of primary interest. In the SM, the latter originate from W and Z boson production with photons radiated from initial-state quarks (prompt photons), photons from the fragmentation of secondary quarks and gluons into isolated photons, and from photons radiated directly by W bosons. The diagrams of these production mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1. Theories beyond the SM, such as technicolor, predict the decay of narrow resonances to W or Z pairs. The data analyses presented here provide differential distributions of relevant kinematic variables, corrected for detector effects, allowing the search for deviations from the SM predictions to be made with high sensitivity.",

The ID consists of three subsystems: the pixel and silicon microstrip (SCT) detectors cover the pseudorapidity 1 range jj < 2:5, while the transition radiation tracker (TRT), which is made of straw tubes, has an acceptance range of jj < 2:0. The calorimeter system covers the range jj < 4:9. The highly segmented electromagnetic calorimeter, which plays a crucial role in electron and photon identification, comprises lead absorbers with liquid argon (LAr) as the active material and covers the range jj < 3:2. In the region jj < 1:8, a presampler detector using a thin layer of LAr is used to correct for the energy lost by electrons and photons upstream of the calorimeter. The hadronic tile calorimeter (jj < 1:7) is a steel/scintillating-tile detector and is located directly outside the envelope of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. The two end-cap hadronic calorimeters have LAr as the active material and copper absorbers. The calorimeter coverage is extended to jj \u00bc 4:9 by a forward calorimeter with LAr as active material and copper (EM) and tungsten (hadronic) as absorber material. The MS is based on three large superconducting aircore toroid magnets, a system of three stations of chambers for precise tracking measurements in the range jj < 2:7, and a muon trigger system that covers the range jj < 2:4.",

In order to measure this background from data, a sample is selected by applying all signalregion selection criteria except for requiring \u00c1\u00f0E miss T ; jet\u00de < 0:4. By requiring the E miss T direction to be close to the jet direction, the selected events in the control region are dominated by \u00fe jets background. The yield of \u00fe jets obtained in control regions is then scaled by an extrapolation factor to predict the \u00fe jets background yield in the signal region, where the extrapolation factor is taken from a \u00fe jets MC sample. By varying the E miss T threshold from 60 to 100 GeVand varying the jet multiplicity requirement for the events from N jet !0 to N jet ! 1, alternative control samples are obtained to evaluate the systematic uncertainties. The main systematic uncertainty in the \u00fe jets estimate comes from the different background yields in different control regions. The systematic uncertainty on the extrapolation factor is obtained by comparing the predictions from SHERPA and PYTHIA \u00fe jets MC samples and varying the energy scale and resolution for jets and E miss T in MC samples. Other backgrounds.-Background contributions from other processes are determined from MC samples. The contributions from Z\u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de and t \" t are found to be small (about 1% of the total background). The contributions from the other processes such as Z\u00f0' \u00fe ' \u00c0 \u00de, , and diboson production are found to be negligible due to the strict cuts applied to the E miss T and the photon transverse energy. To investigate the possibility of noncollision backgrounds, the distributions of the direction of flight as well as quality criteria (e.g. shower shapes) of the photon candidates in data are compared to those expected from the signal simulation to search for discrepancies. The direction of flight, which is determined by using the depth segmentation of the EM calorimeter, can show if the photon appears to be coming from a vertex other than the primary vertex. The spectra of the direction of flight as well as the quality criteria are found to be completely consistent with those photons produced in events with real photons [e.g. W\u00f0'\u00de \u00fe and Z\u00f0' \u00fe ' \u00c0 \u00de \u00fe ] leading to the conclusion that if there are noncollision background events, they are negligible.",

In this analysis, particle level refers to stable particles, defined as having lifetimes exceeding 10 ps, that are produced from the hard scattering or after the hadronization but before their interaction with the detector. The extrapolation corrects for the signal acceptance losses in the calorimeter transition region (1:37 < jj < 1:52) for electrons and photons and in the high-region (2:4 < jj < 2:47) for muons. It also corrects for the Z-veto requirement in the W electron channel, for the transverse mass selection criteria in both channels in the W analysis, and for the acceptance loss due to the selection requirements on \u00c1\u00f0E miss T ; \u00de and \u00c1\u00f0E miss T ; jet\u00de in the analysis.

Table VI summarizes the systematic uncertainties on C V from different sources, on the signal acceptance A V , and on the background estimates. The dominant uncertainties on C V come from photon identification and isolation efficiency. The photon identification efficiency is determined from the signal MC samples where the shower-shape distributions of the photon are corrected to account for the observed small discrepancies between data and simulation. The systematic uncertainty is determined by comparing the corrected nominal value from MC simulation with the efficiency measurement using a pure photon sample from radiative Z decays in data [36].

By doing a similar study, the uncertainty on the photon isolation efficiency is found to be less than 3%.",

For each pseudoexperiment, the signal-plus-background model is fit in steps of \u00c1m ! T \u00bc 1 GeV for the Z channel and \u00c1m a T \u00bc 1 GeV for the W channel to measure a residual signal strength. For each mass point the mean value of the fitted strength is measured. If there is no bias in the fit model, this distribution should be centered exactly at 0. Since this is not the case, the systematic uncertainty on the background shape is taken to be the difference between 0 and the most discrepant fitted strength obtained anywhere in the mass range, augmented by the 1 uncertainty on that fitted strength. The size of this effect is measured to be 0.2 fb for the Z analysis. This represents about 5% on the limit at low masses and up to 20% at high masses. It is measured to be 1.2 fb for the W analysis, which represents about 6% on the limit at low masses and up to 25% at high masses. This dominant systematic effect is taken into account in the fit model, by allowing the backgrounds to fluctuate like the signal, but constrained by these values.",
