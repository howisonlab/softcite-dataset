In this article we present results of a study of the processes: e + e \u2212 \u2192\u1ebd + R\u1ebd \u2212 1 in two Supersymmetric benchmark scenarios at \u221a s = 3 TeV and 1.4 TeV at CLIC. We characterize the detector performance, lepton energy resolution and boson mass resolution. We report the accuracy of the production cross section measurements and the\u1ebd R ,\u03bc R ,\u03bd e ,\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , and\u03c7 0 1 mass determinations, estimate the systematic errors affecting the mass measurement and discuss the requirements on the detector time stamping capability and beam polarization. The analysis accounts for the CLIC beam energy spectrum and the dominant beam-induced background. The detector performances are incorporated by full simulation and reconstruction of the events within the framework of the CLIC ILD CDR detector concept.",

            "text": "One of the main objectives of linear collider experiments is the precision spectroscopy of new particles predicted in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5]. In this article, we study the production of the supersymmetric partners of the muon, electron and neutrino in two specific SUSY benchmark points, where we assume R-parity conservation within the so-called constrained Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (cMSSM). In this model the neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle. Table 1 shows the masses and the branching ratios of the supersymmetric particles for the two benchmark points P1 and P2. The squarks masses\u0169 R ,\u0169 L ,d R ,d L are 1.9 TeV for P1 and 2.2 TeV for P2. The parameters of the two benchmark points are such that they are compatible with the constraints of other observables, e.g. \u2126 DM , \u2206(g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) and with LHC limits on squarks and gluinos. The benchmark points mass spectrum were chose before the 125 GeV boson discovery was made. For both benchmark points the Higgs boson mass is 120 GeV.",

The cut values vary according to the particle type (photon, neutral hadron, charged particle), the detector region, (central, forward) and the p T of the particle. Table 5 shows the cut values for the tight particle flow (PFO) selection. The presence of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadron background sets strong requirements for the design of the CLIC detector and its readout. R . In final states with four jets and two leptons, the background from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192hadrons cannot be removed using a similar p T cut, as this would significantly degrade the jet energy reconstruction. Figure 6 (c) shows the bias in the reconstructed electron energy when the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192hadron background is included. This bias is due to additional background particles being associated with the electron in the attempt to account for FSR and bremsstrahlung. Without PFO cuts, the energy resolution is not degraded but the central value is shifted. Figure 6 (d) shows the lepton energy resolutions without and with \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons overlaid after tight PFO selection cuts.

Then the Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) method from the multivariate analysis toolkit, TMVA [26], is used to implement the event selection. Firstly the discriminating variables of the Monte Carlo sample are input to the BDT method which trains the BDT probability classifier and computes the weights to distinguish signal from background. Next the weigths are used to the evaluate the \"Data\" sample and compute for each event a probability value used to rank the events to be signal or background-like. The cut value is chosen to optimise the significance S M C / \u221a S M C + B M C versus the signal efficiency and the background rejection; S M C and B M C are the number of signal and background events of the MC sample. The cross section and the masses are determined after background subtraction and efficiency correction; the errors on the masses depend on \u221a S data + B data + B M C . A stronger BDT cut reduces slightly the significance but decreases significantly the errors on the masses. Figure 10 shows for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192\u1ebd +",

The resolution is parametrised using the sum of two Gaussian functions G1 and G2; G1 for the peak and G2 for the tails. For the muons the r.m.s. of G1 is 1.5 \u2022 10 \u22125 GeV \u22121 , and the r.m.s. of G2 is 4.9 \u2022 10 \u22125 GeV \u22121 . Only 4.1% of the events are outside of the central region; the central region of the distribution is defined within the interval \u2206E/E 2 True = \u00b10.5 \u2022 10 \u22123 GeV \u22121 . The electron energy resolution is described by the Gaussian G1 with a very similar r.m.s. as that for muons, 1.4 \u2022 10 \u22125 GeV \u22121 , however, even with bremsstrahlung recovery, about 30% of the events are outside the central region. These are due to cases where final state radiation and bremsstrahlung are not sufficiently well accounted for; the tails are reasonably well described by the Gaussian G2 with r.m.s. = 7.7 \u2022 10 \u22125 GeV \u22121 .The SM process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 is a potential background for the two leptons final state events. At 3 TeV the preselection cuts listed in section 2 reduce the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 cross section from 252 fb to 0.05 fb. For 100 GeV particles the impact parameter resolution is 1.5 micron at 90 degree and 5 microns at 10 degree[22]. For the event selection, in addition to the preselection cuts, a cut on the impact parameter is applied. The cut value is 30 microns; it reduce the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 cross section from 0.05 fb to 0.005 fb. This cross section is smaller than those of all other backgrounds listed in table 3 and represents less than 0.1% of all the backgrounds; this process was therefore considered as negligible. The same conclusion is reached for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e + e\u2212 events and is valid at 1.4 TeV.Hadronic final state events with semi-leptonic decays, e.g. tt events, are a potential background for two lepton final state events. To suppress these events, in addition to the preselection cuts described in section 2, a charged particle multiplicity cut is applied; the cut value is different at 3 TeV and 1.4 TeV. The selection efficiency of this cut, in presence of beam-induced background, is discussed in section 3.3.",
