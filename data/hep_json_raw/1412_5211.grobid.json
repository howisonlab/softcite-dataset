            "text": "The flavor sector is that part of the standard model (SM) that arises from the interplay of quark weak gauge couplings and quark-Higgs couplings. The misalignment of these in the mass eigenstate basis gives rise to the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix that encodes the physics of the weak flavor-changing decays of quarks. There are three generations of quarks and a very wide range of quark couplings and masses; however, we observe hadrons, not quarks. The top quark is so massive that it decays on timescales shorter than the typical hadronization time into other quarks. Bottom and charm quarks are therefore the most massive quarks that can comprise observable particles, and these are termed the \"heavy flavor\" hadrons. Their large mass often allows for relatively precise theoretical predictions via symmetries, perturbative QCD and the operator product expansion, heavy quark expansion, lattice QCD calculations, and QCD sum rules. Along the way, a great deal can be learned in the area of strong interactions that permits the probing of the weak physics of heavy flavors and the CKM matrix.",

Lifetimes and branching fractions straddle the boundary of weak decays and hadronic physics effects. The 3 \u00d7 3 CKM matrix allows for a CP-violating phase, and with enough independent measurements, it is possible to test SM predictions for CP violation. We know that the SM level of CP violation is not sufficient to explain the current matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, so we are continually searching for additional sources of CP violation due to physics beyond the standard model. The handy interferometric system of neutral heavy meson mixing and oscillations is another avenue to test CP violation as well as provide powerful constraints on CKM matrix elements. Finally, quantum effects in flavor loops can occur in any of the above areas and in cleanly predicted rare decays of heavy hadrons that in turn provide exquisitely sensitive probes for new physics. Following a description of the characteristics of heavy flavor physics at the Tevatron, all of the heavy flavor results from the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations in each of these areas are reviewed.",

            "text": "The most appealing feature of hadron machines as tools to study b physics is their very high cross section for bb production. The Tevatron was a copious source of b hadrons with a production cross section four orders of magnitude greater than that at e + e \u2212 B factories. B factories operating at the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(4S) only produce B 0 and B \u00b1 mesons, and after LEP ceased operations, the Tevatron was a unique source for all the other heavier b hadrons such as B 0 s , B + c , b baryons, and all their excited states for more than a decade. a Despite a very large production rate, b-quark events were a minuscule fraction of the overall pp event rate at the Tevatron. While the cross section for hadronic interactions at the Tevatron is about 50 mb, for the production of b and c quarks in the central region where the experiments have sensitivity, it is only about 10 \u00b5b. Two features of heavy quarks make it possible to observe meaningful levels of signal among the enormous backgrounds. The first is the long lifetime of 1.5 ps for b hadrons, so that these boosted hadrons are likely to decay at secondary vertices a significant distance (of the order of a millimiter) from the beamline and interaction point of the pp beams. The reconstruction of these secondary vertices or the observation that a charged particle track is inconsistent with pointing back to the beamline is a powerful signature for identifying heavy flavor decays. Secondly, b hadrons have semileptonic branching ratios that are about 10% while it is rare for leptons to be produced in the prompt decays of light hadrons. Leptons are produced from interactions or decays at larger distances such as electrons from photon conversions, or muons from decays in flight of kaons and pions, but these backgrounds are small compared to inclusive hadron rates and can be studied and controlled. The situation for charm particles is more complicated. The lifetime and semileptonic branching ratio of D + mesons is similar to those for b hadrons; however, due to the large number of decay modes available to D 0 and D + s mesons and to charm baryons, their lifetimes are considerably shorter and semileptonic branching ratios are smaller. Nonetheless, these signatures can be used for charm physics, albeit with more difficulty than in b-quark studies.",

            "text": "Due to huge event rates, effective triggers and quality detectors are essential for extracting physics results. Heavy flavor analyses typically require detector strengths in three aspects of the experiments: triggering, reconstruction, and flavor tagging. Heavy quarks are produced in hadronic colliders preferentially at small polar angles \u03b8 (with respect to the beam axis) and at large absolute values of pseudorapidity \u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. Both experiments employed muons from b \u2192 \u00b5 and b \u2192 c \u2192 \u00b5 for triggering. With a muon acceptance 1 in rapidity |\u03b7| < 2 that is twice as large as CDF's, the D\u00d8 detector has a distinct advantage in inclusive muon and dimuon triggering and studies. With less material before the first set of muon chambers, the CDF detector allows the study of dimuons with lower momenta. CDF's deadtimeless data acqusition system allowed for high-rate triggers based only on tracking information in the first level of the three-level system. Events so selected could be analyzed by the online silicon vertex tracker (SVT), 2 the first trigger processor developed to measure track impact parameters. The impact parameter resolution of the SVT was similar to that for offline reconstruction. The SVT gave CDF access to a host of decay modes that include only charged hadrons in the final state. Electrons from semileptonic decays were included in the triggers of both experiments, but played a significantly lesser role in the physics program.",

With a much larger radius tracker, the CDF detector has superior momentum resolution leading to significantly better resolution on the reconstructed invariant masses of particles. This helps not only in the measurement of the masses themselves, but also with background rejection. The D\u00d8 detector gains from the larger rapidity acceptance of the tracker 4 that extends out to |\u03b7| < 3. The impact parameter resolution of the CDF silicon detector 5 and the D\u00d8 silicon microvertex tracker (SMT) 6 (with a \"Layer 0\" 7 added in 2006 partway through Run 2) are similar, approximately 30 \u00b5m for tracks with typical momenta from b hadron decay with an asymptotic resolution of 10-15 \u00b5m for high momentum single tracks. CDF also includes hadron identification with both specific ionization (dE/dx) measurement in the drift chamber 3 and a time-of-flight (TOF) system 8 comprising scintillator bars between the drift chamber and the solenoid. TOF measurements give unambiguous kaon identification for p T < 0.7 GeV, and at higher momenta the combination of dE/dx and TOF can be used on a statistical basis to separate particle types in reconstructed decays.",

            "text": "Flavor tagging in the context of heavy flavor physics is the determination of whether a particle with the potential of mixing or in a decay that is a CP eigenstate (e.g., D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) was created as a particle or anti-particle. In b physics, there are two types of flavor tags: away-side and same-side. In an away-side tag, the flavor of the other produced b hadron is used to determine the flavor of the one under study. These can be in the form of either a lepton presumably from a semileptonic decay or from the weighted sum of the charges of particles with displaced impact parameters. The rapidity of a b andb are only weakly correlated, so the efficiency of making a tag is substantially better with D\u00d8's larger \u03b7 range. However, these tags suffer from background and resolution effects that make the probability of an incorrect tag large as well. Same-side tags seek to identify the last particle created in the fragmentation process before the b hadron emerges. Thus a \u03c0 + would be associated with a B 0 , a K + with a B 0 s , and the negative tagging hadrons with aB 0 orB 0 s meson. Same-side tags have high efficiency because they are associated with the B already within the detector acceptance. Given the large population of background pions, the TOF system in CDF was instrumental in employing the same-side kaon flavor tag in studies of B s mixing. For charm physics, the key tag is the exploitation of the sign of the charge of the soft pion from D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays to determine the charm flavor. For placing constraints on CP violation, the Tevatron also has an advantage of having a CP-invariant initial state of the pp beams and hence almost perfect CPsymmetric production in contrast to the LHC where production in pp collisions is not CP symmetric. In addition, the D\u00d8 detector has solenoidal and toroidal magnetic fields and consistently switched polarities of the magnets at regular two-week intervals. As a result, differences in reconstruction efficiency between positively and negatively charged particles cancel to first order allowing high-precision measurements of charge asymmetries in the study of CP violation.",

            "text": "CDF pioneered the full reconstruction of B mesons with a measurement 17 of the B + meson cross section using the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + . The measurement 18 of the average BB mixing fraction in dilepton events served as a determination of fraction of B 0 s mesons in b-hadron production based on the B 0B0 mixing fraction observed in e + e \u2212 colliders at the \u03a5(4S) and the expectation of complete mixing for B 0 s mesons. Run 1 (1992-95) led to a revolution in thinking about heavy-quark physics at hadron colliders. While studies of heavy-quark production continued, CDF's installation of the SVX, 19 the first silicon microvertex detector at a hadron collider, provided the opportunity not only to measure b hadron lifetimes [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] but also a substantial reduction in backgrounds that was critical to measurements of b hadron masses. 30,31 The riddle of large J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 was at once solved and renewed with the measurement 32 of differential production cross sections where the SVX could be used to separate prompt charmonium from that arising from b-hadron decays and showed the prompt fraction to be much larger than had been anticipated. Fur-ther work toward understanding quarkonium production included measurements of the \u03a5 production spectrum; [33][34][35] polarization in J/\u03c8, \u03c8 , and \u03a5 decays; 35,36 and the fractions of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 that result from \u03c7 production. 34,37,38 Measurements of b hadron cross sections were refined, [39][40][41] and correlations 42 between leptons and displaced tracks at both \u221a s = 1800 and 630 GeV showed that theory properly described the energy scaling and that that the apparent discrepancies between CDF and UA1 had to come from another source. The production fractions of b hadron species were also studied. 43,44 The low backgrounds afforded by the SVX also brought limits [45][46][47][48][49] on rare decays and measurements [50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57] of B meson decay properties such as the amplitudes in B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K ( * ) . A highlight of Run 1 is the discovery 58,59 of the B c meson with the measurement of its lifetime showing that the decay of the charm quark dominated the decay width. Based on the development of tagging techniques used in BB mixing measurements, [60][61][62][63][64] CDF made and the first non-trivial limit on the CKM angle \u03b2 from the measurement 65,66 of sin 2\u03b2 in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S decays which set the stage for the mixing and CP-violation measurements that would come in Run 2.",

            "text": "The D\u00d8 detector did not participate in the first runs of the Tevatron (Run 0), but did join CDF in Run 1 operations beginning in 1992. The Run 1 D\u00d8 detector was optimized to meet the goals of excellent identification of electrons and muons, good measurement of parton jets at large p T through a highly segmented calorimeter with very good energy resolution, and a well-controlled measure of missing transverse energy. The central design features 67 thus incorporated a compact, non-magnetic inner tracking volume with reasonable spatial resolution and particular emphasis on suppression of backgrounds to electrons. Via a toroidal magnetic field, the transverse momenta of muons could be determined, so invariant masses of only dimuon pairs could be found. The Run 1 D\u00d8 detector included a drift chamber vertex detector, so was able to reconstruct the impact parameters of tracks, but could not reconstruct invariant masses of long-lived heavy-flavor particles creating secondary vertices. b hadrons were identified via their semileptonic decays to muons, with the p T of the muon relative to the jet axis used to separate charm semileptonic decays. As a result, the D\u00d8 heavy-flavor program in Run 1 was limited to b-quark and b-jet inclusive and differential cross section measurements, 68-71 J/\u03c8 cross section measurements, 72,73 and a search for rare b decay. 74 To prepare for a vigorous heavy-flavor program for Run 2, the D\u00d8 detector upgrade 4 maintained its excellent muon coverage and calorimetry, but now included a central magnetized tracker comprised of a superconducting solenoid surrounding a scintillating fiber tracker over a wide range of detector \u03b7 plus a silicon microvertex tracker (SMT) 6, 7 which provided the benefits described above.",

Comparison to theory is more robust than in the case of the derived quark cross sections because the hard production and fragmentation can be calculated in a consistent framework. CDF also measured 77 the differential cross section of J/\u03c8 mesons produced in b hadron decays. The fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons from b hadron decays is determined by considering the displacement of the J/\u03c8 decay points. Prompt mesons have a decay point consistent with the beamline, while those from the b decays will be displaced as a result of the long b lifetime. While event-by-event identification is not possible, the distributions are sufficiently distinct that prompt fractions can be measured in each momentum bin. Monte Carlo simulations are used to correct for the fraction of the parent b hadron momentum carried by the J/\u03c8 mesons to yield a differential cross section for bottom hadrons   Measurements of both b quarks or b jets in the same event and their correlations have also been made at the Tevatron.

The former analysis measured a fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons from \u03c7 cJ decays to be significantly less than that predicted by direct charmonium production and gluon fragmentation. CDF's measurement 77 of the inclusive J/\u03c8 spectrum has been described above in Sect. 4.1 with results shown in Fig. 3(b). While the inclusive spectrum is measured down to zero transverse momentum, the prompt component can be separated only for p T > 1. 25 GeV. Because there are no cc states between the \u03c8 and the opencharm threshold, the \u03c8 cross section provides a clean test of production models compared to the J/\u03c8 that is polluted by \u03c7 c feed down. CDF measured the \u03c8 spectrum 87 using dimuon events. The method for separating prompt and secondary components is the same as in the J/\u03c8 measurement. The results are consistent with gluon-tower models 88 which have large uncertainties. However, like the J/\u03c8 cross section, \u03c8 production is poorly fit by NNLO QCD descriptions. 89 Bottomonium states are produced either promptly or indirectly as a result of the decay of a higher mass state, e.g., in a radiative decay such as \u03c7 b \u2192 \u03a5(1S)\u03b3, but with the advantage over charmonium of not being produced via the decays of other heavy flavor states leading to a simpler analysis as all states are prompt.",

Discrepancies between results for \u03bb \u03b8 obtained by different experiments suggest that quarkonia might be strongly polarized when produced, but that different experimental acceptances can impact the final measurement. Early analyses measured only \u03bb \u03b8 as a function of p T (\u03a5) in one reference frame; however, polarization could be manifested by significantly non-zero values of \u03bb \u03d5 or \u03bb \u03b8\u03d5 even when \u03bb \u03b8 near zero. 94 While the observed lack of transverse polarization at high momentum in the helicity basis is inconsistent with NRQCD-inspired models, it is not a definitive demonstration of a lack of polarization in \u03a5 production. To demonstrate that the production is truly unpolarized, CDF performed a full three-dimensional decomposition to measure 95 the three components of polarization \u03bb \u03b8 , \u03bb \u03d5 , and \u03bb \u03b8\u03d5 in both the helicity and Collins-Soper frames for p T < 40 GeV for \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and \u03a5(3S) decays to muon pairs.

The X(3872), was first observed in exclusive decays B \u00b1 \u2192 XK \u00b1 , X \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 from B mesons produced in e + e \u2212 collisions. The value of its mass very close to the D 0D * 0 mass threshold along with failure of models of conventional higher-mass cc charmonium states to match its mass has generated a great deal of interest in this state, with suggestions of it being a weakly bound D 0 -D * 0 \"molecular\" state, 133 a possible four-quark state, 134 or a ccg hybrid. Shortly following this discovery, both the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations also observed 135,136 inclusive production of this narrow state in pp collisions through the decay X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 as shown in Fig. 13(a). D\u00d8 compared characteristics of the decay with that of the \u03c8(2S) and observed no differences, 136 while CDF, with larger data sets, made more detailed measurements of its properties. One hypothesis for the X(3872) is that it is a four-quark state. Therefore, there would be two different states ccu\u016b and ccdd with slightly different masses. 134 CDF placed an upper limit 137 of 3.6 MeV for the mass splitting of the two states assuming equal abundance, effectively excluding the four-quark hypothesis. Given that the X(3872) is a single narrow state, CDF then made the most precise measurement of its mass: 3871.61 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.19 MeV. A CDF study 138 of the dipion mass distribution placed constraints on its J P C assignment. Fig. 14 compares the observed dipion mass spectrum to the lowest C-odd possibilities. The data give a good fit to J/\u03c8\u03c1 0 models, but it is not possible to differentiate between J = 0 and J = 1. To determine the spin-parity of the state, CDF used a larger data sample and performed an angular analysis as shown in Fig. 13(b) where the fit clearly favors the J/\u03c8\u03c1 0 hypothesis, but finds J P C = 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ to be equally likely, each with a \u03c7 2 probability of 28%.",

In addition to the opposite-side tagging described above, same-side tagging was also used to take advantage of fragmentation on the reconstructed side of the event. For an example, if an associated K + containing a strange antiquark is found, the strange quark will have likely hadronized with ab, tagging the flavor at production Until the Tevatron Run 2 started, there were only lower limits on the value of \u2206m s .

The SM naturally includes CP violation (CPV) in the quark sector through the presence of a single complex phase in the CKM matrix, which in turn determines the strength of flavor transitions through the weak interaction. However, the degree of CPV from this SM source is insufficient to explain the cosmological matter dominance. 212 Heavy flavor systems are ideal to search for new phases and levels of CPV that depart from SM predictions. There are three kinds of CP violation, all explored at the Tevatron: direct CP violation where the probability for a particle to decay to a given final state differs from the probability for the antiparticle to decay to the charge conjugate state |A f | 2 = |\u0100f | 2 , CP violation in mixing where |q/p| = 1 (see Eq. 3), and in the interference of decay and mixing amplitudes. b",

While CP asymmetries of B 0 and B + mesons can be studied at e + e \u2212 colliders, a complete understanding can be achieved only by comparing results to those for B 0 s meson which are the exclusive domain of hadron colliders. The study of charmless modes of \u039b 0 b also offers the opportunity to search for physics beyond the standard model. The CDF SVT was designed for the purpose of identifying two-body charmless decays in the trigger. 221 With a sample of only 180 pb \u22121 , CDF was able to make the first observation 222 of a charmless B 0 s decay mode. While the signature of a two-particle decay that is displaced from the beamline gives a quite clean signal for decays of the form B (s) \u2192 h + h \u2212 where h and h are either pions or kaons, the signals from the various modes are nearly degenerate in mass. Therefore, it is necessary to use particle identification coupled with kinematic information to disentangle the various modes. While measurements of dE/dx in the CDF drift chamber cannot provide eventby-event identification, when included in a likelihood fit along with the mass and the asymmetry between the h + and h \u2212 momenta, the yields in the various modes can be determined. Thus CDF was able to observe B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 and to make measurements of the branching ratios of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 that were nearly as good as those from B factories at that time. 223 Using similar methods, in a sample of 1 fb \u22121 CDF was made the first observation 224 of the decay modes B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 , and \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 , each with greater than 6\u03c3 significance, and measured their branching ratios. Differences between CP asymmetries in B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 observed at the b factories [225][226][227] is significantly larger than na\u0131ve expectations of the SM. 228,229 Insight into theoretical explanations of these results can be found from the asymmetry in B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. Using improved techniques in the 1 fb \u22121 sample, CDF made the first measurement 230  decays came with 6.1fb \u22121 and the first evidence 231 for the charmless annihilation decay mode B 0 s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Subsequently, LHCb made the first observation 232 of CP violation in B 0 s decays. Using the full 9.6 fb \u22121 dataset, CDF confirmed 233 that observation. The asymmetry measurements in the charmless \u039b 0 b decay modes have better than 10% precision and show no significant asymmetry. Those measurements remain unique to CDF.",

In previous publications, [247][248][249][250] the D\u00d8 Collaboration measured A b with increasingly larger datasets with values representing up to a 3.9\u03c3 deviation from the SM prediction. The analysis 193 with the full Run 2 dataset added a more detailed study of the asymmetry dependence on the impact parameter (IP), p T , and |\u03b7| of each muon, as well as including an additional CP-violating process to interpret results. 251 Measurements in the dimuon sample shown in Fig. 27(a) give a result of A CP that represents a 3.6\u03c3 deviation from the SM prediction which is the largest observed deviation in the heavy flavor physics program at the Tevatron. Since the fractional mix of B 0 and B 0 s is different in each (IP 1 , IP 2 ) bin, the semileptonic charge asym- metries can be extracted as shown in Fig. 27(b). The result deviates from the SM by 3.0\u03c3. The results are consistent with the independent D\u00d8 measurements 243, 244 of a d sl and a s sl described above, and the combination of all D\u00d8 results are also shown in Fig. 27(b). These are the most precise determinations of these quantities so far from a single measurement. The observed dimuon charge asymmetry also has a contribution from the CP violation in the interference of decay amplitudes for the decay B 0 (B 0 ) \u2192 ccdd with and without mixing. 251 Since this contribution is proportional to the quantity \u2206\u0393 d /\u0393 d , the measurement also allows for the extraction of \u2206\u0393 d /\u0393 d = (0.50 \u00b1 1.38)% (and (0.79 \u00b1 1.15)% when combining all the D\u00d8 measurements). This combination is still consistent with all other measurements, and also stresses the importance of having more independent measurements of \u2206\u0393 d /\u0393 d .",

In the analysis 265 of 2 fb \u22121 , CDF improved the muon selection and applied a neural net classifier. The limit was calculated using several bins of neural net score with different background suppression factors in order to improve sensitivity. In a 7 fb \u22121 sample, CDF found 266 a small excess above expected backgrounds that was more consistent with SM production than with the null hypothesis, but not sufficiently significant to claim discovery. Backgrounds in this study were verified in comparisons to data in orthogonal samples. This result was confirmed in the full dataset, leading to the result 267 B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = (1.3 +0.9 \u22120.7 ) \u00d7 10 \u22128 .

The analogous state B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6 + \u2212 tests the same transition and has been explored at the Tevatron. The D\u00d8 Collaboration searched 268 for the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , restricting the invariant mass of the dimuons to be outside the charmonium resonances to avoid large interference effects with dominant decay modes such as B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6, and set a limit that was the most stringent at the time.",

With a factor of four increase in data, CDF made the first observation 270 of the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and measured the differential decay rate d\u0393/dq 2 and the dimuon forward-backward asymmetry A F B as a function of q 2 \u2261 M 2 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) in B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays as well as the the longitudinal polarization fraction F L as a function of q 2 in the B 0 mode. Because the presence of new particles mediating these FCNC  decays can change the internal dynamics of the decay, distributions of quantities like d\u0393/dq 2 , A F B , and F L provide important opportunities to search for the effects of new physics. The CDF measurements were quite competitive with those from the e + e \u2212 B factories. 271,272 With improved analysis methods, in a sample of 6.8 fb \u22121 , CDF made the first observation 273 of a FCNC decay of a baryon for the decay \u039b b \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with a significance corresponding to 5.8\u03c3.

The improvements in technology and increases in luminosity that came with Run 2 coupled with the ingenuity of analyzers led to an explosion of heavy flavor results including the discovery of B s mixing and new baryons, world-leading measurements of CP violation and b hadron properties, and precision results on heavy-quark and quarkonium production and spectroscopy.",

By isolating the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 f 0 (980), the CDF Collaboration made the first measurement 159 of the B 0 s lifetime with a CP-eigenstate as a final state, thus directly determining 1/\u0393 H = 1/(\u0393 s \u2212 \u2206\u0393 s /2) (neglecting CP violation).
