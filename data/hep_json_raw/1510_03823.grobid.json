This paper describes the methods employed in the ATLAS experiment to correct for the impact of pile-up on jet energy and jet shapes, and for the presence of spurious additional jets, with a primary focus on the large 20.3 fb \u22121 data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. The energy correction techniques that incorporate sophisticated estimates of the average pile-up energy density and tracking information are presented. Jet-to-vertex association techniques are discussed and projections of performance for the future are considered. Lastly, the extension of these techniques to mitigate the effect of pile-up on jet shapes using subtraction and grooming procedures is presented.",

Consequently, multiple pp interactions occur within each bunch crossing. Averaged over the full data sample, the mean number of such simultaneous interactions (pile-up) is approximately 21. These additional collisions are uncorrelated with the hard-scattering process that typically triggers the event and can be approximated as contributing a background of soft energy depositions that have particularly adverse and complex effects on jet reconstruction. Hadronic jets are observed as groups of topologically related energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeters, and therefore pile-up affects the measured jet energy and jet structure observables. Pile-up interactions can also directly generate additional jets. The production of such pile-up jets can occur from additional 2 \u2192 2 interactions that are independent of the hardscattering and from contributions due to soft energy deposits that would not otherwise exceed the threshold to be considered a jet. An understanding of all of these effects is therefore critical for precision measurements as well as searches for new physics.",

When the instan-taneous luminosity is measured by integrating over many bunch crossings, Eq. (1) yields the average number of interactions per crossing, or \u03bc . The so-called in-time pile-up due to additional pp collisions within a single bunch crossing can also be accompanied by out-of-time pile-up due to signals from collisions in other bunch crossings. This occurs when the detector and/or electronics integration time is significantly larger than the time between crossings, as is the case for the liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeters in the ATLAS detector. The measured detector response as a function of \u03bc in such cases is sensitive to the level of out-of-time pile-up. The distributions of \u03bc for both the \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV runs (collectively referred to as Run 1) are shown in Fig. 1. The spacing between successive proton bunches was 50 ns for the majority of data collected during Run 1. This bunch spacing is decreased to 25 ns for LHC Run 2. Out-of-time pile-up contributions are likely to increase with this change. However, the LAr calorimeter readout electronics are also designed to provide an optimal detector response for a 25 ns bunch spacing scenario, and thus the relative impact of the change to 25 ns may be mitigated, particularly in the case of the calorimeter response (see Sect. 2).",

            "text": "The different responses of the individual ATLAS subdetector systems to pile-up influence the methods used to mitigate its effects. The sensitivity of the calorimeter energy measurements to multiple bunch crossings, and the LAr EM calorimeter in particular, necessitates correction techniques that incorporate estimates of the impact of both in-time and out-of-time pile-up. These techniques use the average deposited energy density due to pile-up as well as track-based quantities from the inner tracking detector (ID) such as the number of reconstructed primary vertices (N PV ) in an event. Due to the fast response of the silicon tracking detectors, this quantity is not affected by out-of-time pile-up, to a very good approximation.  Resolving individual vertices using the ATLAS ID is a critical task in accurately determining the origin of chargedparticle tracks that point to energy deposits in the calorimeter. By identifying tracks that originate in the hard-scatter primary vertex, jets that contain significant contamination from pile-up interactions can be rejected. These approaches provide tools for reducing or even obviating the effects of pileup on the measurements from individual subdetector systems used in various stages of the jet reconstruction. The result is a robust, stable jet definition, even at very high luminosities.",

[2]. These estimates allow for a sophisticated pile-up subtraction technique in which the four-momentum of the jet and the jet shape are corrected event-by-event for fluctuations due to pile-up, and whereby jet-by-jet variations in pile-up sensitivity are automatically accommodated. The performance of these new pile-up correction methods is assessed and compared to previous pile-up corrections based on the number of reconstructed primary vertices and the instantaneous luminosity [3,4]. Since the pile-up subtraction is the first step of the jet energy scale (JES) correction in ATLAS, these techniques play a crucial role in establishing the overall systematic uncertainty of the jet energy scale. Nearly all ATLAS measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model published since the end of the 2012 data-taking period utilise these methods, including the majority of the final Run 1 Higgs cross section and coupling measurements [5][6][7][8][9].",

E/ p-ranges from 20 to 80% in the range of charged hadron momentum between 1-30 GeV and is well described by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation [15]. In contrast to the pixel and microstrip tracking detectors, the LAr calorimeter readout is sensitive to signals from the preceding 12 bunch crossings during 50 ns bunch spacing operation [16,17]. For the 25 ns bunch spacing scenario expected during Run 2 of the LHC, this increases to 24 bunch crossings. The LAr calorimeter uses bipolar shaping with positive and negative output which ensures that the average signal induced by pile-up averages to zero in the nominal 25 ns bunch spacing operation. Consequently, although the LAr detector will be exposed to more out-of-time pile-up in Run 2, the signal shaping of the front-end electronics is optimised for this shorter spacing [16,18], and is expected to cope well with the change. The fast readout of the Tile calorimeter, however, makes it relatively insensitive to out-of-time pile-up [19]. The LAr barrel has three EM layers longitudinal in shower depth (EM1, EM2, EM3), whereas the LAr end-cap has three EM layers (EMEC1, EMEC2, EMEC3) in the range 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.5, two layers in the range 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2 and four hadronic layers (HEC1, HEC2, HEC3, HEC4).

The transverse segmentation of both the EM and hadronic LAr end-caps is reduced in the region between 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2 compared to the barrel layers. The forward LAr calorimeter has one EM layer (FCal1) and two hadronic layers (FCal2, FCal3) with transverse segmentation similar to the more forward HEC region.

Groomed jets are often used in searches involving highly Lorentz-boosted massive objects such as W/Z bosons [26] or top quarks [27]. Unless noted otherwise, the jet trimming algorithm [28] is used for groomed jet studies in this paper. The procedure implements a k t algorithm [29,30] to create small subjets with a radius R sub = 0.3. The ratio of the p T of these subjets to that of the jet is used to remove constituents from the jet. Any subjets with p Ti / p jet T < f cut are removed, where p Ti is the transverse momentum of the ith subjet, and f cut = 0.05 is determined to be an optimal setting for improving mass resolution, mitigating the effects of pile-up, and retaining substructure information [31].

The measurements presented in this paper primarily use single-jet triggers. The rate of events in which the highest transverse momentum jet is less than about 400 GeV is too high to record more than a small fraction of them.

The topological clustering algorithm incorporates a built-in pile-up suppression scheme to limit the formation of clusters produced by pile-up depositions as well as to limit the growth of clusters around highly energetic cells from hard-scatter signals. The key concept that allows this suppression is the treatment of pile-up as noise, and the use of cell energy thresholds based on their energy significance relative to the total noise. Topological clusters are built using a three-dimensional nearest-neighbour algorithm that clusters calorimeter cells with energy significance |E cell |/\u03c3 noise > 4 for the seed, iterates among all neighbouring cells with |E cell |/\u03c3 noise > 2, and that finally adds one additional layer of cells |E cell |/\u03c3 noise > 0 when no further nearest-neighbours exceed the 2\u03c3 threshold at the boundary (not allowed to extend to next-to-nearest neighbours). The total cell noise, \u03c3 noise , is the sum in quadrature of the cell noise due to the readout electronics and the cell noise that is due to pile-up (\u03c3 noise pile\u2212up ). The pile-up noise for a given cell is evaluated from Monte Carlo simulation and is defined to be the RMS of the energy distribution resulting from pile-up particles for a given number of pp collisions per bunch crossing (determined by \u03bc ) and a given bunch spacing t. It is technically possible to adjust the pile-up noise for specific data-taking periods depending on \u03bc , but it was kept fixed for the entire Run 1 8 TeV dataset.",

Raising the pile-up noise value effectively increases the threshold for cluster formation and growth, significantly reducing the effects of pile-up on the input signals to jet reconstruction. Figure 2 shows the electronic and pile-up noise contributions to cells that are used to define the thresholds for the topological clustering algorithm. In events with an average of 30 additional pile-up interactions ( \u03bc = 30), the noise from pile-up depositions is approximately a factor of 2 larger than the electronic noise for cells in the central electromagnetic calorimeter, and it reaches 10 GeV in FCal1 and FCal2. This high threshold in the forward region translates into a reduced topo-cluster occupancy due to the coarser segmentation of the forward calorimeter, and thus a smaller probability that a given event has a fluctuation beyond 4\u03c3 . The implications of this behaviour for the pile-up p T density estimation are discussed in Sect. 5.1.",

In ATLAS, the inputs to the k t jets used in the \u03c1 calculation are positiveenergy calorimeter topo-clusters within |\u03b7| \u2264 2.0. The \u03b7 range chosen for calculating \u03c1 is motivated by the calorimeter occupancy, which is low in the forward region relative to the central region. The cause of the low occupancy in the forward region is complex and is intrinsically related to the calorimeter segmentation and response. The coarser calorimeter cell size at higher |\u03b7| [10], coupled with the noise suppression inherent in topological clustering, plays a large role. Since topo-clusters are seeded according to significance relative to (electronic and pile-up) noise rather than an absolute threshold, having a larger number of cells (finer segmentation) increases the probability that the energy of one cell fluctuates up to a significant value due to (electronic or pileup) noise. With the coarser segmentation in the end-cap and forward regions beginning near |\u03b7| = 2.5 (see Fig. 2), this probability becomes smaller, and clusters are predominantly seeded only by the hard-scatter signal. In addition, the likelihood that hadronic showers overlap in a single cell increases along with the probability that fluctuations in the calorimeter response cancel, which affects the energy deposited in the cell. The mean \u03c1 measured as a function of \u03b7 is shown in Fig. 3. The measurements are made in narrow strips in \u03b7 which are \u03b7 = 0.7 wide and shifted in steps of \u03b4\u03b7 = 0.1 from \u03b7 = \u22124.9 to 4.9. The \u03b7 reported in Fig. 3 is the central value of each strip. The measured \u03c1 in each strip quickly drops to nearly zero beyond |\u03b7| 2. Due to this effectively stricter suppression in the forward region, a calculation of \u03c1 in the central region gives a more meaningful measure of the pile-up activity than the median over the entire \u03b7 range, or an \u03b7-dependent \u03c1 calculated in slices across the calorimeter. Distributions of \u03c1 in both data and MC simulation are presented in Fig. 4 for SHERPA and POWHEG+PYTHIA 8. Both MC generators use the same pile-up simulation model. The event selection used for these distributions corresponds to Z (\u2192 \u03bc\u03bc)+jets events where a Z boson ( p Z T > 30 GeV) and a jet (|\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 20 GeV) are produced backto-back ( \u03c6(Z , leading jet) > 2.9). Both MC simulations slightly overestimate \u03c1, but agree well with each other. Small differences between the MC simulations can be caused by different modelling of the soft jet spectrum associated with the hard-scattering and the underlying event.",

Because of the noise suppression inherent in topological clustering, only pile-up signals above a certain threshold can form separate clusters. Low-energy pile-up deposits can thus only contribute measurable energy to the event if they overlap with other deposits that survive noise suppression. The probability of overlap is dependent on the transverse size of EM and hadronic showers in the calorimeter, relative to the size of the calorimeter cells. Due to fine segmentation, pile-up mainly contributes extra clusters in the central regions of the calorimeter where \u03c1 is calculated (|\u03b7| 2).",

If out-of-time signals from earlier bunch crossings are isolated from in-time signals, they may form negative energy clusters, which are excluded from jet reconstruction and the calculation of \u03c1. However, overlap between the positive jet signals and out-of-time activity results in both positive and negative modulation of the jet energy. Due to the long negative component of the LAr pulse shape, the probability is higher for an earlier bunch crossing to negatively contribute to signals from the triggered event than a later bunch crossing to contribute positively. This feature results in a negative dependence of the jet p T on outof-time pile-up. Such overlap is more probable at higher |\u03b7|, due to coarser segmentation relative to the transverse shower size. In addition, the length of the bipolar pulse is shorter in the forward calorimeters, which results in larger fluctuations in the out-of-time energy contributions to jets in the triggered event since the area of the pulse shape must remain constant. As a result, forward jets have enhanced sensitivity to out-of-time pile-up due to the larger impact of fluctuations of pile-up energy depositions in immediately neighbouring bunch crossings.",

The noise suppression provided by the topological clustering procedure has a smaller impact in the dense core of a jet where significant nearby energy deposition causes a larger number of small signals to be included in the final clusters than would otherwise be possible. Furthermore, the effects of pile-up in the forward region are not well described by the median p T density as obtained from positive clusters in the central region. A residual correction is therefore necessary to obtain an average jet response that is insensitive to pile-up across the full p T range. Figure 5 shows the \u03b7 dependence of the transverse momentum of anti-k t R = 0.4 jets on N PV (for fixed \u03bc ) and on \u03bc (for fixed N PV ). Separating these dependencies probes the effects of in-time and out-of-time pile-up, respectively, as a function of \u03b7. These results were obtained from linear fits to the difference between the reconstructed and the true jet p T (written as p reco T \u2212 p true T ) as a function of both N PV and \u03bc . The subtraction of \u03c1 \u00d7 A jet removes a significant fraction of the sensitivity to in-time pile-up. In particular, the dependence decreases from nearly 0.5 GeV per additional vertex to 0.2 GeV per vertex, or a factor of 3-5 reduction in pile-up sensitivity. This reduction in the dependence of the p T on pile-up does not necessarily translate into a reduction of the pile-up dependence of other jet observables. Moreover, some residual dependence on N PV remains. Figure 5b shows that \u03c1 \u00d7 A jet subtraction has very little effect on the sensitivity to out-of-time pile-up, which is particularly significant in the forward region. The dependence on N PV is evaluated in bins of \u03bc , and vice versa. Both dependencies are evaluated in bins of p true T and \u03b7 as well. The slope of the linear fit as a function of N PV does not depend significantly on \u03bc , or vice versa, within each ( p true T , \u03b7) bin. In other words, there is no statistically significant evidence for non-linearity or crossterms in the sensitivity of the jet p T to in-time or out-of-time pile-up for the values of \u03bc seen in 2012 data. A measurable effect of such non-linearities may occur with the shorter bunch spacing operation, and thus increased out-of-time pileup effects, expected during Run 2 of the LHC. Measurements and validations of this sort are therefore important for establishing the sensitivity of this correction technique to such changes in the operational characteristics of the accelerator.",

This residual correction is derived by comparison to truth particle jets in simulated dijet events, and it is completely analogous to the average pile-up offset correction used previously in ATLAS [4]. Due to the preceding \u03c1 \u00d7 A jet subtraction, the residual correction is generally quite small for jets with |\u03b7| < 2.1. In the forward region, the negative dependence of jets on out-of-time pile-up results in a significantly larger residual correction. The \u03bc -dependent term of the residual correction is approximately the same size as the corresponding term in the average offset correction of Eq.

The first method uses track-jets to provide a measure of the jet p T that is pile-up independent. This requires the presence of track-jets and so can only be used in the most central region of the detector for |\u03b7| < 2.1. It is not statistically limited. The second method exploits the p T balance between a reconstructed jet and a Z boson, using the p Z T as a measure of the jet p T . This enables an analysis over the full (|\u03b7| < 4.9) range of the detector, but the extra selections applied to the jet and Z boson reduce its statistical significance. The N PV dependence must therefore be evaluated inclusively in \u03bc and vice versa. This results in a degree of correlation between the measured N PV and \u03bc dependence. While the pile-up residual correction is derived from simulated dijet events, the in-situ validation is done entirely using Z +jets events. In the track-jet validation, although the kinematics of the Z boson candidate are not used directly, the dilepton system is relied upon for triggering, thus avoiding any potential bias from jet triggers. Figure 7a shows the results obtained when matching antik t R = 0.4, LCW reconstructed jets to anti-k t R = 0.4 track-jets. No selection is applied based on the calorimeterbased jet p T . Good agreement is observed between data and MC simulation; however, a small overcorrection is observed in the N PV dependence of each.

The first approach is to use the individu- A second approach is also tested in which the full ratio is treated as a single observable and corrected directly. The resulting agreement between data and MC simulation is very similar in the two cases. However, for very high p T jets (600 GeV \u2264 p jet T < 800 GeV) the first approach is preferable since it yields final ratios that are closer to the values obtained for truth-particle jets and a mean \u03c4 32 that is more stable against \u03bc . On the other hand, at lower jet p T (200 GeV \u2264 p jet T < 300 GeV), applying the jet shape subtraction to the ratio itself performs better than the individual \u03c4 N corrections according to the same figures of merit. Since substructure studies and the analysis of boosted hadronic objects typically focus on the high jet p T regime, all results shown here use the individual corrections for \u03c4 N in order to compute the corrected \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 32 . Figure 8 presents the uncorrected and corrected distributions of \u03c4 32 , in both the observed data and MC simulation, as well as the truth-particle jet distributions. In the case of Fig. 8b, the mean value of \u03c4 32 is also presented for trimmed jets, using both the reconstructed and truth-particle jets. This comparison allows for a direct comparison of the shape subtraction method to trimming in terms of their relative effectiveness in reducing the pile-up dependence of the jet shape. Additional selections are applied to the jets used to study \u03c4 32 in this case: \u03c4 21 > 0.1 (after correction) and jet mass m jet > 30 GeV (after correction). These selections provide protection against the case where \u03c4 2 becomes very small and small variations in \u03c4 3 can thus lead to large changes in the ratio. The requirement on \u03c4 21 rejects approximately 1% of jets, whereas the mass requirement removes approximately 9% of jets. As discussed above, the default procedure adopted here is to correct the ratio \u03c4 21 by correcting \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 separately. In cases where both the corrected \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are negative, the sign of the corrected \u03c4 21 is set to negative.",

Pile-up jets arise from two sources: hard QCD jets originating from a pile-up vertex, and local fluctuations of pile-up activity. The pile-up QCD jets are genuine jets and must be tagged and rejected using the vertex-pointing information of charged-particle tracks (outof-time QCD jets have very few or no associated tracks since the ID reconstructs tracks only from the in-time events). Pileup jets originating from local fluctuations are a superposition of random combinations of particles from multiple pile-up vertices, and they are generically referred to here as stochastic jets. Stochastic jets are preferentially produced in regions of the calorimeter where the global \u03c1 estimate is smaller than the actual pile-up activity. Tracking information also plays a   Fig. 8 a Comparisons of the uncorrected (filled blue circles), corrected (red) distributions of the ratio of 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness (\u03c4 32 ) for data (points) and for MC simulation (solid histogram) for leading jets in the range 600 \u2264 p T < 800 GeV.

The mean value of \u03c4 32 computed using stable truth particles (green) is also included key role in tagging and rejecting stochastic jets. Since tracks can be precisely associated with specific vertices, track-based observables can provide information about the pile-up structure and vertex composition of jets within the tracking detector acceptance (|\u03b7| < 2.5) that can be used for discrimination. The composition of pile-up jets depends on both \u03bc and p T . Stochastic jets have a much steeper p T spectrum than pileup QCD jets. Therefore, higherp T jets that are associated with a primary vertex which is not the hard-scatter vertex are more likely to be pile-up QCD jets, not stochastic jets. On the other hand, while the number of QCD pile-up jets increases linearly with \u03bc , the rate of stochastic jets increases more rapidly such that at high luminosity the majority of pile-up jets at low p T are expected to be stochastic in nature [57].",

Information from the tracks matched to each jet may be used to further reject any jets not originating from the hard-scatter interaction. ATLAS has developed three different track-based tagging approaches for the identification of pile-up jets: The jet vertex fraction (JVF) algorithm, used in almost all physics analyses in Run 1, a set of two new variables (corrJVF, and R pT ) for improved performance, and a new combined discriminant, the jet vertex tagger (JVT) for optimal performance. While the last two approaches were developed using Run 1 data, most analyses based on Run 1 data were completed before these new algorithms for pile-up suppression were developed. Their utility is already being demonstrated for use in high-luminosity LHC upgrade studies, and they will be available to all ATLAS analyses at the start of Run 2.",

A cut on the JVF variable can help to remove jets which are not associated with the hard-scatter primary vertex. Using tracks reconstructed from the ID information, the JVF variable can be defined for each jet with respect to each identified primary vertex (PV) in the event, by identifying the PV associated with each of the charged-particle tracks pointing towards the given jet. Once the hard-scatter PV is identified, the JVF variable can be used to select jets having a high likelihood of originating from that vertex. Tracks are assigned to calorimeter jets following the ghost-association procedure [50], which consists of assigning tracks to jets by adding tracks with infinitesimal p T to the jet clustering process. Then, the JVF is calculated as the ratio of the scalar sum of the p T of matched tracks that originate from a given PV to the scalar sum of p T of all matched tracks in the jet, independently of their origin.",

In the Z +jets events used for these studies of pile-up suppression, this selection of the hard-scatter primary vertex is found to be correct in at least 98% of events. JVF may then be interpreted as an estimate of the fraction of p T in the jet that can be associated with the hard-scatter interaction. The principle of the JVF variable is shown schematically in Fig. 10a. Figure 10b shows the JVF distribution in MC simulation for hard-scatter jets and for pile-up jets with p T > 20 GeV after pile-up subtraction and jet energy scale correction in a Z (\u2192 ee)+jets sample with the \u03bc distribution shown in Fig. 1. Hard-scatter jets are calorimeter jets that have been matched to truth-particle jets from the hard-scatter with an angular separation of R \u2264 0.4, whereas pile-up jets are defined as calorimeter jets with an angular separation to the nearest truth-particle jet of R > 0.4.

For example, a jet with significant neutral pile-up contributions may receive JVF = 1, while JVF = 0 may result from a fluctuation in the fragmentation of a hard-scatter jet such that its charged constituents all fall below the track p T threshold. JVF also relies on the hard-scatter vertex being well separated along the beam axis from all of the pile-up vertices. In some events, a pile-up jet may receive a high value of JVF because its associated primary vertex is very close to the hard-scatter primary vertex. While this effect is very small for 2012 pile-up conditions, it will become more important at higher luminosities, as the average distance between interactions decreases as 1/ \u03bc . For these reasons, as well as the lower probability for producing a pile-up QCD jet at high p T , JVF selections are only applied to jets with p T \u2264 50 GeV.",

By comparison to truth-particle jets in MC simulation, it was found that the level of pile-up jet contamination in this sample is close to 2% near 20 GeV and almost zero at the higher end of the range near 50 GeV. The JVF distribution for the jet balanced against the Z boson in these events is well modelled for hard-scatter jets. However, the total jet multiplicity in these events is overestimated in simulated events, due to mismodelling of pile-up jets. This is shown in Fig. 11, for several different choices of the minimum p T cut applied at the fully calibrated jet energy scale (including jet-area-based pile-up subtraction). The application of a JVF cut significantly improves the data/MC agreement because the majority of pile-up jets fail the JVF cut: across all p T bins, data and MC simulation are seen to agree within 1% following the application of a JVF cut. It is also observed that the application of a JVF cut results in stable values for the mean jet multiplicity as a function of \u03bc . Figure 11 also shows the systematic uncertainty bands, which are only visible for the lowest p T selection of 20 GeV. These uncertainties are estimated by comparing the JVF distributions for hard-scatter jets in data and MC simulation. The efficiency of a nominal JVF cut of X is defined as the fraction of jets, well balanced against the Z boson, passing the cut, denoted by E nom MC and E nom data for MC events and data, respectively. The systematic uncertainty is derived by finding two JVF cuts with E MC differing from E nom MC by \u00b1(E nom MC \u2212 E nom data ). The JVF uncertainty band is then formed by re-running the analysis with these up and down variations in the JVF cut value. Systematic uncertainties vary between 2 and 6% depending on jet p T and \u03b7.",

If a track is attached to more than one vertex, priority is given to the vertex with higher ( p track T ) 2 . In the second step, if a track is not associated with any primary vertex after the first step but satisfies | z| < 3 mm with respect to the hard-scatter primary vertex, it is assigned to the hard-scatter primary vertex.

Jets initiated by light quarks (u, d, s) have on average a lower number of associated hard-scatter tracks but a slightly higher jet energy response [59] and both effects lead towards an increase in the number of jets with no associated tracks from the hard-scatter primary vertex relative to gluon-initiated jets. Figure 15 shows the corrJVF, R pT and JVT distributions for hard-scatter jets with 20 < p T < 30 GeV initiated by gluons and light quarks. Using a leading-order notion of jet flavour, the parton-level flavour labelling refers to the highest-energy parton within a narrow cone of size R = 0.3 around the jet axis. The distributions for jets initiated by light quarks have more entries at low corrJVF, R pT and JVT val-  ues and consequently a worse separation from pile-up jets. Most notably, about twice as many light-quark jets have no associated tracks from the hard-scatter primary vertex, that is corrJVF = JVT = 0. Figure 16 shows the efficiency versus fake-rate curve for JVT for jets initiated by light quarks, gluons and b-quarks. As expected from Fig. 15, the performance is worse for jets initiated by light quarks. The pile-up versus hard-scatter jet discrimination performs best for hard-scatter jets initiated by b-quarks. The efficiency versus fake-rate curve for jets initiated by c-quarks is similar to that of gluon jets.",

In JVF cleansing, the four-momentum of each subjet is scaled by the subjet JVF, aiming to approximate the momentum of the subjet arising from neutral and charged particles from the hard-scatter vertex only. In linear cleansing, the subjet four-momentum from the hard-scatter vertex is approximated by scaling the reconstructed four-momentum based on the assumption that the ratio of charged to charged plus neutral pile-up p T contributing to a subjet is 0.55 [61]. Each f cut used in these procedures is chosen to optimise the mass resolution. For 2012 pile-up conditions, the application of track-assisted grooming achieves a similar mass resolution to that of calorimeterbased trimming. Figure 19b compares the performance of the track-assisted grooming procedure with the variants of the jet cleansing concept. All of the methods studied show significant improvements in the jet mass resolution and stability with respect to pile-up. For the pile-up conditions expected during the LHC Run 1 and Run 2, studies using simulated data do not exhibit any significant difference between corrJVF and jet cleansing. However, for higher luminosity conditions expected beyond 2023 at the LHC the track-based grooming provides an alternative to calorimeter-only approaches. Another advantage of track-based grooming over standard calorimeter-based grooming is that no p T threshold is involved in the removal of subjets. This means that in the limit of no pile-up, track-based grooming does not remove any signal, unlike for example trimming, which always rejects subjets that fall below the f cut threshold.",

A residual pile-up correction is necessary to fully accommodate the impact of pile-up on jet p T as the high-occupancy jet core contributes some extra sensitivity to both in-time and out-of-time pile-up, and the effects of pile-up on forward jets are not fully described by the median p T density as calculated from topological clusters in the central calorimeter.

It also reduces the dependence of jet multiplicity on pile-up, shifting the majority of pile-up jets below the minimum jet p T threshold.

The impact on jet reconstruction and measurement is significant and has thus improved many aspects of the physics program in ATLAS. Pile-up corrections and suppression algorithms both for small and large radius jets have enhanced the discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment and improved the precision for Standard Model measurements. New and more advanced methods that are presented in this paper and developed towards the end of the LHC Run 1 will provide additional handles and improved precision for pile-up mitigation for the upcoming LHC Run 2 and the future high-luminosity upgrades.",
