We analyze various final states associated with the main production mechanisms of the Higgs boson, the Higgs-strahlung and W W -fusion processes. The statistical precision of the production cross section times the branching ratio is estimated to be 2.6 and 6.9 % for the Higgs-strahlung and W W -fusion processes, respectively, with the nominal integrated luminosities assumed in the ILC Technical Design Report; the precision improves to 1.0 and 3.4 % with the running scenario including possible luminosity upgrades. The study provides a reference performance of the ILC for future phenomenological analyses.",

            "text": "After the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the LHC [1,2], the investigation of the properties of the Higgs boson has become an important target of study in particle physics. In the Standard Model (SM), the coupling of the Higgs boson to the matter fermions, i.e., the Yukawa couplings, is proportional to the fermion mass. The Yukawa couplings can deviate from the SM prediction in the presence of new physics beyond the SM. Recent studies indicate that the deviations from the SM could be at the few-percent level if there is new physics at the scale of around 1 TeV [3]. It is therefore desired to measure the Higgs couplings as precisely as possible in order to probe new physics.",

This decay has been studied by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments, who reported a combined signal yield consistent with the SM expectation, with a combined observed significance at the level of 5.5\u03c3 [4][5][6]. The purpose of this study is to estimate the projected ILC capabilities of measuring the h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode in final states resulting from the main Higgs boson production mechanisms in e + e \u2212 collisions. Existing studies on h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays at e + e \u2212 collisions [7,8] did not take into account some of the relevant background processes or were based on a Higgs boson mass hypothesis which differs from the observed value, both of which are addressed in this study. We assume the ILC capabilities for the accelerator and the detector as documented in the ILC Technical Design Report (TDR) [9][10][11][12][13] together with its running scenario published recently [14,15]. The results presented in this paper will be useful for future phenomenological studies.",

The numbers for scenarios including energy and luminosity upgrades are based on studies in Refs. [14,15]. Figure 1 shows the diagrams for the main production mechanisms of the Higgs boson in e + e \u2212 collisions.

The return yoke of the solenoidal magnet has a builtin muon system. The ILD design has not yet been finalized. In this analysis, we assume the following configurations and performance. The VTX consists of three double layers of silicon pixel detectors with radii at 1.6, 3.7 and 6 cm. Each silicon pixel layer provides a point resolution of 2.8 \u00b5m. The TPC provides up to 224 points per track over a tracking volume with inner and outer radii of 0.33 and 1.8 m. The SIT and SET are used to improve the track momentum resolution by adding precise position measurements just inside and outside of TPC. The ECAL consists of layers of tungsten absorbers interleaved with silicon layers segmented into 5 \u00d7 5 mm 2 cells, has an inner radius of 1.8 m, and has a total thickness of 20 cm corresponding to 24 radiation length. The HCAL consists of layers of steel absorbers interleaved with scintillator layers segmented into 3 \u00d7 3 cm 2 cells and has an outer radius of 3.4 m corresponding to 6 interaction length. Additional silicon trackers and calorimeters are located in the forward region to assure hermetic coverage down to 5 mrad from the beam line. The key detector performance of the ILD model is summarized in Table 2. Details of the ILD model and the particle flow algorithm are found in Refs. [13,28].",

The effect of the interference between these two processes is studied using the distribution  Fig. 6. A clear peak around the Z boson mass is visible, with a small contribution underneath it coming from the tail from higher masses, indicating that the interference of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdh process and the W W -fusion is small.

            "text": "We now discuss the prospects of the measurement precision with the ILC running scenarios proposed in Refs. [14,15] by Table 8 Integrated luminosity (in fb \u22121 ) for various beam polarizations (P(e \u2212 ), P(e + )) at \u221a s = 250 and 500 GeV for three running scenarios. \"Nominal\" is the scenario described in the TDR [9] and used in the main results of this paper. \"Initial\" and \"Full\" are the scenarios proposed in Refs. [ extrapolating the results presented in the previous sections. Table 8 summarizes the integrated luminosities for various center-of-mass energies and beam polarizations for three different scenarios we consider. In order to estimate the statistical precision of the cross section times the branching ratio measurements with electron and positron beam polarizations other than (\u22120.8, +0.3) used in the previous sections, we need to know the corresponding selection efficiencies for the signal and background processes. In the following, we assume the same selection efficiencies obtained in the previous sections for all of these beam polarizations, although in principle the angular distributions of the final states may depend on the beam polarizations. This assumption is nevertheless justified as follows. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh process is mediated by the s-channel Z boson exchange with the vector or the axial vector coupling, which forbids the same-sign helicity states (\u00b11, \u00b11), while giving more or less the same angular distributions for the opposite-sign helicity states (\u22131, \u00b11). On the other hand, the W W -fusion process proceeds only through the left-right helicity states (\u22121, +1), since the W boson couples only to the left-handed e \u2212 and the right-handed e + . For the signal processes, therefore, their angular distributions stay the same for the active (i.e. opposite) helicity states, independently of the choice of beam polarizations. The same reasoning applies to the background processes with the s-channel \u03b3 /Z exchange or those involving W bosons coupled to the initial state e + or e \u2212 . On the other hand, the processes involving t-channel photon exchange or photon-photon interactions do not forbid the same-sign helicity states. However, since the probability of finding an electron and a positron in the samesign helicity states is the same for both the (\u22120.8, +0.3) and (+0.8, \u22120.3) beam polarizations, the efficiencies for such background processes with the same-sign helicity states should also be the same. In our estimation, we do not use the results of the (\u00b10.8, \u00b10.3) beam polarizations, since the signal cross sections are small and the integrated luminosities collected at these beam polarizations are foreseen to be small. Under these assumptions, the selection efficiencies will not depend on the choice of beam polarizations. We can then esti-mate the projected statistical precision for other scenarios by calculating the number of signal and background events with the production cross sections and the integrated luminosities for individual beam polarizations, according to the running scenarios. The result from this estimation is summarized in Table 9.",

The expected statistical precision of the branching ratio after combining all the modes except the \u03bd\u03bdh mode is 3.6 % for the nominal running scenario.

The effect of detector simulation is not applied of the invariant mass of the neutrino pair M \u03bd\u03bd computed from event generator information as shown inFig. 6. A clear peak around the Z boson mass is visible, with a small contribution underneath it coming from the tail from higher masses, indicating that the interference of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdh process and the W W -fusion is small. We hence split the events into two categories based on this generator-level variable, and define events with M \u03bd\u03bd < 120 GeV as \"e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh\" events, and those with M \u03bd\u03bd > 120 GeV as \"W W -fusion\" events.
