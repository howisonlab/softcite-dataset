            "text": "In 1970, the Rome-Syracuse Collaboration (RSC) studied the branching ratio of the decay \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1] using the data of thepn annihilations at rest collected in the 30\" BNL bubble chamber. The analysis measured the upper limit 4.3% at 95% confidence level and found an unexpected result: the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution of 1496 annihilations at rest pn \u2192 2\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 \u2212 (1) had a narrow peak at about 755 MeV/c 2 . This distribution is shown in Fig. 1a. A \u03c7 2 fit of this distribution found that the peak had a significance of about 4.5 standard deviations (SD) and a width lower than the experimental resolution. No relation was found between the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and other angular and mass distributions. These facts suggested to the RSC that the peak was generated by a fluctuation.

This peaking cannot be generated by a reflection because no significative correlations were found between the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 peak and other mass and angular distributions. The low mass suggests that it cannot have J > 1. Furthermore, the REDPS peak is too narrow for being produced by the \u03c1(770) 0 resonance and its mass is 25 MeV/c 2 far from that of the \u03c9 meson. Lastly, the peak cannot be due to the \u03c1(770) 0 \u2212 \u03c9 interference. In fact, the annihilations (1) are dominated by the S-wave initial states [3,6]. Because the G-parity conservation, the channelpn \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 is generated by the 1 S 0 state, while the channelpn \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 is generated by the 3 S 1 state.

It could be generated by an unknown scalar meson or could be a property of the S w interaction that was not reproduced in the previous analysis [2,3]. In fact, the phase-shits parametrization shown in Fig. 2a is below 90 \u2022 till up 862 MeV/c 2 . This hypothesis sugests that the peak could be reproduced by forcing the phase shift parametrization to pass at 90 \u2022 at 757.4 MeV/ 2 . Unfortunately, the events of the RSC are too low for allowing a convincing study of the effects of the variations of the I = 0 S-wave amplitude.",
