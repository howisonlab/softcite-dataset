            "text": "1. Introduction J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) are bound states of charm (c) and anti-charm (c) quarks. Final color-singlet charmonium physical state can be produced via either color-singlet (CS) or color-octet (CO) intermediate cc state. Based on this, there are different models that try to describe cc pair production and its hadronization to the physical charmonium state, such as Color Singlet Model (CSM), Color Evaporation Model (CEM), or more sophisticated Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) calculations. However, the charmonium production mechanism in elementary particle collisions is not yet exactly known. For many years measurements of the charmonium cross sections have been used to test different production models. While many models can describe relatively well the experimental data on the J/\u03c8 cross section in p + p collisions [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], they have different predictions for the J/\u03c8 polarization. Therefore, measurements of the J/\u03c8 polarization may allow to discriminate among different models and provide new insight into the J/\u03c8 production mechanism. Further constraints for models can be obtained by looking at the J/\u03c8 production vs relative charged-particle event multiplicity.",

These results are compared to different model predictions in order to understand the J/\u03c8 production mechanism in elementary collisions. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows STAR low and high-p T measurements of J/\u03c8 p T spectra [2,9] at \u221a s = 200 GeV compared to different model predictions: CEM [10], NNLO* CS [12] and NLO NRQCD calculations with both color-singlet and color-octet contributions (NLO CS+CO) [11]. The NNLO* CS model prediction is for the direct J/\u03c8 production only, so it does not include contributions from \u03c8(2S), \u03c7 C and B-meson decays to J/\u03c8, which may account for as much as 40% of the inclusive J/\u03c8 production. The right panel of Fig. 1  production [11,13,14]. In both cases NLO NRQCD calculations describe the data well at a higher p T range, p T 4 GeV/c. The result at \u221a s = 200 GeV is also in a good agreement with the CEM prediction.",

We observe a strong correlation between the J/\u03c8 yield and event activity, and for p T > 4 GeV/c there is a stronger than linear growth for higher multiplicities. The same behaviour has been observed for J/\u03c8 and open charm by the LHC experiments. There is also a hint of p T dependence of the correlation, but further analysis, especially in the dimuon decay channel for higher event activity bins is required in order to draw strong conclusions. Results are also compared to the default PYTHIA 8 tune that includes multiple parton-parton interactions, for both analysed p T ranges, and to the percolation model [16] which is based on a string screening assumption. Both models can describe the observed increase of the J/\u03c8 relative yield.",

            "text": "\u221a s = 200 and 500 GeV J/\u03c8 polarization is analyzed via the angular distribution of the decay electrons that is described by:  measurement of the J/\u03c8 polarization was performed at \u221a s = 200 GeV at mid-rapidity and 2 < p T < 6 GeV/c, in the helicity frame (HX) [17]. Due to limited statistics only \u03bb \u03b8 polarization parameter, related to the polar anisotropy was extracted as a function of p T . The result was compared to NRQCD calculations [18] and the NLO + CSM prediction [19]. A trend observed in the RHIC data is towards longitudinal polarization as p T increases and, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the result is consistent with the NLO + CSM prediction.  The J/\u03c8 polarization measurements have been extended to a wider p T range of 5-16 GeV/c using p+p dataset at \u221a s = 500 GeV. Both \u03bb \u03b8 and \u03bb \u03c6 parameters have been extracted in the HX and the Collins-Soper (CS) frames. This has also allowed to obtain the frame invariant parameter \u03bb inv = (\u03bb \u03b8 + 3\u03bb \u03c6 )/(1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c6 ) in both frames which is a good cross-check between measurements since any arbitrary choice of a reference frame should give the same value of the \u03bb inv [23]. The left panel of Fig. 3 shows \u03bb \u03b8 in the HX frame as a function of p T at \u221a s = 500 GeV compared to results at \u221a s = 200 GeV and to a prediction of the NLO NRQCD [14,[20][21][22]. We observe similar trend of \u03bb \u03b8 going towards negative values with increasing p T in both analysed colliding energies. And at \u221a s = 500 GeV we have also checked that the \u03bb \u03c6 parameter related to the azimuthal anisotropy is consistent with 0. Since the lower limit in the NRQCD calculations is unconstrained we do not draw conclusions from the comparison to data, and the new data points should help to constrain color-octet Long-Distance Matrix Elements for the model. The right panel of Fig. 3 shows \u03bb inv parameters as a function of p T extracted in the HX and CS frames, shown as full and open symbols, respectively. \u03bb inv has negative values and the results are in agreement between the frames.",

The measurements are compared to different model predictions of the J/\u03c8 production. The p T spectra are described well by the NRQCD calculations. The polarization parameter \u03bb \u03b8 at \u221a s = 200 GeV is consistent with the NLO + CSM. At both colliding energies \u03bb \u03b8 has a trend towards negative values with increasing p T in the HX frame. And at \u221a s = 500 GeV in the HX frame the \u03bb \u03c6 parameter is consistent with 0. Also, frame invariant parameters, \u03bb inv , agree in the HX and CS frames. The first measurement of \u03c8(2S)/J/\u03c8 ratio in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 500 GeV is reported and compared with results from other experiments. No collision energy dependence is observed. A strong correlation is observed between relative J/\u03c8 yield and the event activity which is stronger than linear at higher multiplicities at p T > 4 GeV/c.",
