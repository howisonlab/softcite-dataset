The search is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . An exotic T quark production mode through the decay of a heavy Z resonance is also considered. The search is performed in events with a Z boson decaying leptonically, accompanied by a bottom or a top quark decaying hadronically. No excess of events is observed over the standard model background expectation. Products of production cross section and branching fraction for T and B quarks from 1.26 and 0.13 pb are excluded at 95% confidence level for the range of resonance mass considered, which is between 0.7 and 1.7 TeV. Limits on the product of the Z boson production cross section and branching fraction, with the Z boson decaying to the Tt final state, are set between 0.31 and 0.13 pb, for Z boson masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 TeV. This is the first search at 13 TeV for single production of vector-like quarks in events with a Z boson decaying leptonically accompanied by boosted jets.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] with a mass of 125 GeV [4] by the ATLAS and CMS experiments confirmed the success of the standard model (SM) in predicting a wide range of high-energy phenomena. However, several questions related to the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remain unanswered and, to address them, several new theoretical models have been proposed such as little Higgs [5], large extra dimensions [6,7], and composite Higgs models [8]. Many of these models predict the existence of heavy resonances with masses of the order of 1 TeV, called vector-like quarks (VLQs) [9][10][11][12][13]. These are hypothetical new spin-1/2 particles with the property that left-and right-handed (LH and RH) chiralities transform in the same way under the SM symmetry group SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y \u00d7 SU(3) C . As a consequence, they do not receive mass through a Yukawa coupling term, as do the chiral fermions of the SM, but through a direct mass term of the form m\u03c8\u03c8. A fourth generation of chiral quarks is strongly disfavoured by the precision SM measurements [14], because of the modifications that the Yukawa term would bring to the Higgs production cross section and branching fractions (Bs). The VLQs are not similarly constrained. Previous searches for VLQs have been performed by both ATLAS [15][16][17][18][19][20] and CMS [21][22][23][24], using data samples collected at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV. This paper presents the first search at 13 TeV for single production of VLQs in final states with boosted jets and a leptonically decaying Z boson.",

Using the equivalence theorem [25] the branching fractions for these three decay modes are 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. The T doublet can decay to tZ or tH, each with a branching fraction of 0.5. In this case the doublet structure of the fermion multiplet produces a tree level coupling of the T to the neutral bosons, but not to the W. As we are neglecting possible mass mixings between the T and the t quarks, the branching fraction of the doublet T to the tW final state is taken to be zero. Similarly, the decay modes for a B singlet are tW (branching fraction of 0.5), bZ (0.25), and bH (0.25). The couplings of the new particles to SM particles can be described with the following coefficients: C(bW) (for the pp \u2192 Tb process), C(tW) (for the B(t) final state), C(tZ) (for T(t)), and C(bZ) (for B(b)). For singlet VLQs, the RH chiralities are suppressed compared to the LH ones by a factor proportional to the standard quark mass over the VLQ mass, while for doublets it is the LH chirality that is suppressed [26].",

            "text": "The mass range for the T and B quarks studied in this analysis is 0.7-1.7 TeV, while the Z boson is searched for in the 1.5-2.5 TeV range. Lower masses of VLQs are not investigated because pair production searches of VLQs have excluded masses below 0. 19,21,22]. Furthermore, at high masses single production modes are favoured over the pair production modes. In the mass ranges considered in the analysis, the t quark from the T quark decay can be produced with high transverse momentum JHEP05 (2017)029(p T ), resulting in a final state where the decay products of the t quark are emitted close to each other in a topology with overlapping and merged jets. For this reason, final states with t quark jets (t jets) and W boson jets (W jets) are investigated, i.e. in events with large-cone jets that are identified using jet grooming techniques [30,31] as coming from the hadronic decay of a t quark or a W boson. Jet grooming techniques are used to reduce the impact of the underlying event and the presence of additional primary vertices in the events (pileup), and of low p T gluon radiation, i.e. particles that are not related to the hard process. Evidence for the production of new particles is searched for in the reconstructed candidate heavy quark mass spectrum.",

Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. In addition, the CMS detector has extensive forward calorimetry: two steel and quartz-fiber hadron forward calorimeters, which extend the coverage to regions close to the beam pipe.

The jet energy resolution (JER) for the simulated jets is smeared in order to reproduce the actual detector resolution observed in data. Jet candidates are required to have angular separation \u2206R > 0.4 (0.8) from identified leptons for AK4 (AK8) jets, and are selected with p T > 25 (180) GeV and with |\u03b7| < 2.4.

An AK8 jet is W-tagged if the mass range of the pruned jet is within 65-105 GeV and if \u03c4 21 is lower than 0.6. The efficiency of the W-tagging procedure is corrected for discrepancies between data and simulation [30,51,52]. In a similar way, AK8 jets can be identified as coming from the hadronic decay of a t quark. These t quark jets are required to pass the following selections: p T > 400 GeV, mass of the jet reconstructed with the modified mass drop tagger algorithm [53,54] between 110 and 210 GeV, and \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 , defined using eq.

Finally, AK4 jets can be tagged as coming from a b quark using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [55]. A \"medium\" working point with efficiency of 70% on real b jets and rejection of 99% of light-flavor jets is used together with a \"loose\" working point, which has 85% of efficiency and 90% of rejection.",

The following three systematic uncertainties are also considered. The differences between the measurements and the prediction for the closure test described previously are taken as systematic uncertainties (8-16%). The uncertainty from the b tagging efficiency for the b, c, and light-flavor jets is evaluated by varying the b tagging scale factors (used to correct for the differences between measurements and simulation) by their uncertainties [55,56], giving a systematic uncertainty of between 4 and 10%. Finally, an uncertainty (8-20%) is included that takes into account possible mismodelling of the Z+light quark and Z+b quark fractions in simulation. This systematic uncertainty is computed by changing the Z+b fraction by 50% [57], and re-evaluating the background through the background estimation method.",

The jet four-momenta are varied by the JES and JER uncertainties, resulting in a variation for the signal of between 0.2 and 1.9% for the JES, and 0.1 and 2.0% for the JER.
