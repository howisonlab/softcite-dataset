            "text": "An inclusive search for anomalous production of two prompt, isolated muons with the same electric charge is presented. The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to 1:6 fb \u00c01 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Muon pairs are selected by requiring two isolated muons of the same electric charge with p T > 20 GeV and jj < 2:5. Minimal requirements are placed on the rest of the event activity. The distribution of the invariant mass of the muon pair m\u00f0\u00de is found to agree well with the background expectation. Upper limits on the cross section for anomalous production of two muons with the same electric charge are placed as a function of m\u00f0\u00de within a fiducial region defined by the event selection. The fiducial cross-section limit constrains the like-sign top-quark pair-production cross section to be below 3.7 pb at 95% confidence level. The data are also analyzed to search for a narrow like-sign dimuon resonance as predicted for e.g. doubly charged Higgs bosons (H AEAE ). Assuming pair production of H AEAE bosons and a branching ratio to muons of 100% (33%), this analysis excludes masses below 355 (244) GeV and 251 (209) GeV for H AEAE bosons coupling to left-handed and right-handed fermions, respectively.",

            "text": "Events containing two high-p T , prompt, like-sign leptons are rarely produced in the standard model (SM), but occur with an enhanced rate in several models of new physics. For example, supersymmetry [1], universal extra dimensions [2], left-right symmetric models [3][4][5][6], Higgs triplet models [7][8][9], the little Higgs model [10], fourthfamily quarks [11], and flavor-changing neutral currents resulting in the production of like-sign top quarks [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] could all give rise to final states with two leptons of the same electric charge. Most of these models would result in an excess of like-sign dimuons over the background with no distinct kinematic features. However, doubly charged Higgs bosons (H AEAE ), predicted by some of those models, would be observed as a narrow resonance in the dimuon mass spectrum.",

Both muons are required to have transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and pseudorapidity [21] jj < 2:5, and they must be isolated from other activity in the event. Upper limits on the cross section of non-SM physics in a fiducial region corresponding to the experimental requirements are derived as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. Results are presented inclusively for AE AE production and separately for \u00fe \u00fe and \u00c0 \u00c0 final states. The \u00fe \u00fe result is further used to constrain like-sign top-quark pair production. The data are also used to search for a narrow dimuon resonance with a width much smaller than the detector resolution of $3%. An example of a particle that may result in a narrow mass peak is a short-lived H AEAE boson, predicted by a number of the models for new physics mentioned above. Constraints on the H AEAE mass as a function of its branching ratio to two muons are presented.",

It covers the pseudorapidity range jj < 2:5 and is enclosed by a calorimeter system containing electromagnetic and hadronic sections. The calorimeter system is surrounded by a large muon spectrometer built with three air-core toroids. This spectrometer is equipped with precision chambers (composed of monitored drift tubes and cathode strip chambers) to provide precise position measurements in the bending plane in the range jj < 2:7. In addition, resistive plate chambers and thin gap chambers with a fast response time are used primarily to trigger muons in the rapidity ranges jj 1:05 and 1:05 < jj < 2:4, respectively. Momentum measurements in the muon spectrometer are based on track segments formed in at least two of the three precision chambers.

The background from nonprompt muons is estimated from data using a matrix method [49]. This method requires knowledge of the probabilities for prompt and nonprompt muons to pass the isolation requirement. The probability for nonprompt muons to pass the isolation cut is determined using muons with jd 0 j=\u00f0d 0 \u00de > 5 in dimuon or single-muon samples. These are dominated by semileptonic b-and chadron decays. The probability is found to be 5% rather independently of p T and . A systematic uncertainty is derived from a complementary sample where jd 0 j=\u00f0d 0 \u00de < 3 is required. In this sample, prompt muons from W or Z decays are suppressed by requiring there to be exactly one muon in the event, the transverse mass [50] of the muon and the missing transverse energy [51] to be below 10 GeV, and at least one jet with p T > 20 GeV to be present. The resulting systematic uncertainty on the probability for nonprompt muons to pass the isolation cut varies between 30% and 100% depending on p T .

Only H AEAE bosons decaying to muons with coupling values between 10 \u00c05 and 0.5 are considered to ensure a short lifetime (c < 10 m) and that the relative natural width, \u00c0=M, is less than 1%. Doubly charged Higgs bosons couple to Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons and either lefthanded or right-handed charged leptons, and are denoted H AEAE L or H AEAE R , respectively. While H AEAE L couple both to the Z boson and to photons, H AEAE R bosons only couple to photons, i.e. coupling to any hypothetical right-handed gauge bosons is neglected, resulting in a 2.5 times smaller pair-production cross section for the latter.",

The data agree with the background expectation and no sign of new physics has been found. The data are used to place model-independent upper limits on the cross section of new physics processes giving rise to like-sign dimuons ranging from 5.3 fb for m\u00f0 AE AE \u00de > 300 GeV to 58 fb for m\u00f0 AE AE \u00de > 15 GeV. In addition, constraints are placed on like-sign top-quark and doubly charged Higgs boson production. The 95% C.L. limit on the like-sign top-quark production cross section of 3.7 pb is more than 4 times more restrictive than previous results. The lower mass limit on doubly charged Higgs bosons with a 100% (33%) branching ratio to muons is 355 (244) GeV and 251 (209) GeV for H AEAE bosons coupling to left-handed and right-handed fermions, respectively.",
