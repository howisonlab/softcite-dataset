This is the first application of the energy test in four-body decays. The search is performed for P -even CP asymmetries and, for the first time, is extended to probe the P -odd case. Using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb detector at centre-ofmass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, the world's best sensitivity to CP violation in this decay is obtained.

Within the Standard Model (SM), these amplitudes have different weak phases, and the interference between them may give rise to a violation of the charge-parity (CP) symmetry in the decay. Another necessary condition for this direct CP violation to occur is interference of at least two amplitudes with different strong phases. The strong phase differences are known to be sizeable in charm decays and can enter through the resonances that abundantly contribute to the four-body final states. The sensitivity to CP violation is usually best for decays where the strong phases between interfering resonances have large differences. A rich spectrum of resonances contributes to the decay D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which according to the amplitude analysis performed by the FOCUS collaboration [1], is dominated by the amplitudes for D 0 \u2192 a 1 (1260) + \u03c0 \u2212 with a 1 (1260) + \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)\u03c0 + and for D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (770)\u03c1 0 (770).",

A binned \u03c7 2 technique (S CP ) was used to exclude CP-violating effects at the 10% level. Fourbody decays require five independent variables to fully represent the phase space. Consequently, binned analyses will have a tradeoff between minimising the number of bins, in order to maximise the number of events per bin, and retaining sensitivity to the interference between all contributing resonances. The measurement presented here includes data collected in 2012, resulting in a signal sample that is about three times larger than in the previous LHCb analysis. The method exploited here, known as the energy test, is an unbinned technique, which is advantageous in the analysis of multibody decays. The energy test was applied for the first time to search for to global asymmetries, which may also arise from different production cross-sections of D 0 and D 0 mesons at a proton-proton collider. The method identifies the phase space regions in which CP violation is observed. Being model-independent, this method neither identifies which amplitudes contribute to the observed asymmetry nor measures the actual asymmetry. Consequently, a model-dependent amplitude analysis of D 0 and D 0 decays would be required if evidence for a non-zero CP asymmetry is obtained. The analysis presented here probes separately both P -even and P -odd CP asymmetries. The P -even test is performed through the comparison of the distribution of events in the D 0 and D 0 phase spaces, characterised by squared invariant masses. Additionally characterising the events using a triple product of final-state particle momenta [6][7][8] gives sensitivity to P -odd amplitudes, and thus allows the first test for P -odd CP asymmetries in an unbinned model-independent technique.",

This is the first application of the energy test to four-body decays and extends the approach to allow P -odd CP violation searches. This analysis has the best sensitivity from a single experiment to P -even CP violation and is the first test for P -odd CP violation in this decay. The data are found to be marginally consistent with the hypothesis of CP symmetry at the current level of precision.",

All the candidate pion tracks, those from the D 0 decay products and the \u03c0 s mesons, are required to have p T > 350 MeV/c and p > 3 GeV/c to reduce the combinatorial background. The candidate D 0 decay products must form a good quality vertex. As a consequence of the non-negligible D 0 lifetime, the D 0 decay vertex should typically be significantly displaced from the PV; this is ensured by applying a selection on the significance of the D 0 candidate flight distance. Charm mesons from b hadron decays have larger IPs due to the comparatively long b hadron lifetimes. This secondary charm contribution is suppressed by imposing an upper limit on the \u03c7 2 IP of the D 0 candidate. Background from D 0",
