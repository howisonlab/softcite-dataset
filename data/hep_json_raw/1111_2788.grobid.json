However, until recently no coherent strategy existed for data preservation and re-use, and many important and complex data sets have simply been lost. While the current focus is on the LHC at CERN, in the current period several important and unique experimental programs at other facilities are coming to an end, including those at HERA, b-factories and the Tevatron. To address this issue, an inter-experimental study group on HEP data preservation and long-term analysis (DPHEP) was convened at the end of 2008. The group now aims to publish a full and detailed review of the present status of data preservation in high energy physics. This contribution summarises the results of the DPHEP study group, describing the challenges of data preservation in high energy physics and the group's first conclusions and recommendations. The physics motivation for data preservation, generic computing and preservation models, technological expectations and governance aspects at local and international levels are examined.",

Since the advent of collider experiments the available range in energy and intensity has been enlarged by many orders of magnitude [1]. However, the development, building and commissioning of colliders and the experimental detectors takes considerable human, technological and financial effort. Most colliders and their associated scientific programmes have been unique in energy range, process dynamics or experimental techniques. The data preservation effort aims to ensure long-term availability of these data after the end of the experimental collaborations.",

            "text": "Nowadays the focus of the particle physics community is on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which operates mainly as a pp collider, currently at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. At the same time, a generation of other high energy physics (HEP) experiments have concluded their data taking and the experimental collaborations are finishing their physics programmes. These include the HERA, LEP, KEK and PEP experiments [2], as well as those at the Tevatron, where data taking has recently ended [3]. Data collected from these experiments continue to be crucial to our understanding of particle physics, ranging from precision measurements [4,5] to searches for new signatures beyond the Standard Model [6]. Besides the ongoing analyses that remain to be completed, these data may also provide important future scientific opportunities [7]. Moreover, the data from these experiments are often unique in terms of the initial state particles and are unlikely to be superseded anytime soon, even considering such future projects as the LHeC [8]. The issue of HEP data becoming inaccessible due to technological advances in operating systems, storage hardware or data loss becomes imminent already at the LHC, where the lower-energy and lower-luminosity data collected at 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV in 2010 and 2011 will not be repeated. Such datasets, which are unique in terms of energy regime and experimental conditions should be secured in order to ensure re-use and future accessibility [9]. It is therefore prudent to envisage some form of conservation of the respective data sets. However, HEP has little or no tradition or clear current model of long term preservation of data in a meaningful and useful way. The preservation of and supported long term access to the data is generally not part of the planning, software design or budget of a HEP experiment [10].",

A detailed report on physics cases for data preservation is given elsewhere [11], only a brief review is presented in these proceedings. One of the main assumptions concerning experimental HEP data is that older data will always be superseded by that from the next generation experiment, usually at the next energy frontier. However, this is not always the case and several scenarios exist where the preservation of experimental HEP data would be of benefit to the particle physics community:",

In particular, precision analyses continue long after the end of data taking, making use of the full statistical power and the best knowledge of the systematic uncertainties. This scenario has proven to be true for LEP [12] and a similar tail in the publication timeline is expected for H1 and BaBar [13]. \u2022 It may be favourable to re-do previous measurements to achieve an increased precision via new and improved theoretical calculations (MC models) or newly developed analysis techniques. A re-analysis of the JADE (1979)(1980)(1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986) data has lead to a significant improvement in the determination of the strong coupling \u03b1 s (M Z ), as shown in figure 1 (left), in an energy range that is still unique [4,5]. Figure 1 (middle) shows a variety of \u03b1 s (M Z ) measurements, as well as the current world average, where it can be seen that for the latest H1 measurements the theoretical uncertainty dominates the error [14]. In a situation that mirrors this JADE analysis, it is hoped that the uncertainty on \u03b1 s (M Z ) will be further reduced at some point in the future by re-analysing the very accurate HERA data once improved theoretical predictions become available. \u2022 Combining similar measurements from different experiments increases the statistical significance and reduces systematic uncertainties via cross-calibration techniques to arrive at a more precise result. In figure 1 (right) individual and combined H1 and ZEUS measurements of the reduced neutral current cross section are shown. The combined cross sections serve as the sole input for a QCD analysis at NLO which determines a new set of parton distributions, HERAPDF1.0, with reduced experimental uncertainties [15]. \u2022 If new phenomena are found by analysing data recorded at the LHC or some other future collider, it may be useful or even mandatory to go back, if possible, and verify such results using older data.

The HERA collaborations, as well as BaBar, are all currently involved in dedicated efforts to safeguard and streamline the available documentation concerning their respective experiments (see section 6.2). A level 2 preservation, to conserve the experimental data in simplified format, is considered to be unsuitable for high level analyses, lacking the depth to allow, for example, detailed systematic studies to be performed. However, such a format is ideal for education and outreach purposes, which many experiments in the study group are also actively interested in (see section 6.3). Past experiences with old HEP data indicate that new analyses and complete re-analyses are only possible if all the necessary ingredients to retrieve, reconstruct and understand the data are accounted for. Only with the full flexibility does the full potential of the data remain, equivalent to the DPHEP level 4 data preservation. Accordingly, the majority of participating experiments in the study group plan for a level 4 preservation programme, although different approaches are employed concerning how this goal can be achieved.",

In the case of HEP, data preservation means also preserving the software and environment employed to analyse the data, equivalent to level 3 or 4 of the preservation model. Experience has shown that freezing the software in the latest state would sustain analysis capability for only a limited amount of time. Moreover, frozen simulation and reconstruction software would prevent the implementation of improved reconstruction or calibration algorithms or new MC simulations. It is therefore beneficial to keep the experimental software running and keeping it up-to-date with changes of the system architecture. For this purpose it is advantageous to have a framework available to automatically test and validate the software and data against changes and upgrades to the environment, as well as changes to the experimental software itself. As such a framework would examine many facets common to several current HEP experiments interested in a more complete data preservation model, the development of a generic validation suite is favourable. A full version of such a suite is realised at DESY-IT, in co-operation with the HERA experiments. The scheme, illustrated in figure 3, makes use of a virtual environment capable of hosting an arbitrary number of different virtual machine images and includes automated software build tools and data validation. Such a framework is by design expandable and able to host and validate the requirements from multiple experiments.",

An early preparation is needed and sufficient resources should be provided in order to maintain the capability to re-investigate older data samples and collect all necessary documentation. However, the additional resources are estimated to be rather small in comparison to the person power allocated to the planning, construction and running of an experiment. Typically, a surge of 2-3 FTEs for 2-3 years, followed by steady 0.5-1.0 FTE per year per experiment is required for the implementation of a level 3 or 4 preservation model, which should be compared to 300-500 FTEs per experiment for many years. Therefore, the data preservation cost estimates represent typically much less than 1% of the original investment, for a potential 5-10% increase in physics output. The transition to a new operational model of a collaboration should be considered by HEP experiments before the end of their lifetime. If the change to a long term analysis model is begun too late the experimental collaboration risks being left in an undefined state. In particular, the scientific supervision of the data preservation process and decisions regarding authorship, access to data and supervision of physics output after the collaboration's lifetime may benefit from a restructuring of the collaboration towards the final years. The presence and influence of DPHEP may facilitate this transition by providing common standards and global solutions within the HEP community.",

However, until recently no coherent strategy existed regarding long term access of HEP data and an international study group, DPHEP, was formed to address this issue in a systematic way. Given the current experimental situation, data preservation efforts in HEP are timely, and large laboratories should define and install data preservation projects in order to avoid catastrophic loss of data once major collaborations come to an end. The preservation of the full analysis capability of experiments, including the reconstruction and simulation software, is recommended in order to achieve a flexible and meaningful preservation model. Such a project requires a strategy and well-identified resources, but provides additional research at relatively low cost, enhancing the return on the initial investment in the experimental facilities.",
