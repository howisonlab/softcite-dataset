The razor variables M R and R 2 , as well as the momentum and mass resolution of the diphoton system, are used to categorize events into different search regions. The search result is interpreted in the context of strong and electroweak production of supersymmetric particles. We exclude bottom squark pair-production with masses below 450 GeV for bottom squarks decaying to a bottom quark, a Higgs boson, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) for LSP masses below 250 GeV. For wino-like chargino-neutralino production, we exclude charginos with mass below 170 GeV for LSP masses below 25 GeV. In the GMSB scenario, we exclude charginos with mass below 205 GeV for neutralinos decaying to a Higgs boson and a goldstino LSP with 100% branching fraction.",

            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson [1][2][3], the first fundamental scalar particle ever observed, has opened a new window for exploring physics not described by the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Many models of physics beyond the standard model (BSM) postulate the existence of cascade decays of heavy states involving Higgs bosons [4,5]. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [6], Higgs bosons may be produced in a variety of ways. The bottom squark, the supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark, produced via the strong interaction, may decay to a Higgs boson, quarks, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Similarly charginos or neutralinos produced through the electroweak interaction may decay to a Higgs boson and the LSP. Of particular interest are scenarios with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB), where the lightest neutralino may decay to a Higgs boson and the goldstino LSP ( G) [7,8]. The decay signature depends on whether the chargino and neutralino mixed states are dominated by the wino or higgsino components, the respective supersymmetric partners of the W and Higgs bosons. Diagrams of simplified models [9] for the scenarios considered are shown in Fig. 1. In this paper, we denote the Higgs boson as H to indicate that it is the particle observed by the ATLAS and CMS E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. experiments. In the MSSM, this particle is typically assumed to correspond to the lighter of the two CP-even Higgs particles and is often denoted as h. For the GMSB scenario, we consider simplified models where Higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos are nearly mass-degenerate and both chargino-neutralino and neutralino-pair production result in very similar final state signatures, and are hereafter collectively referred to as chargino-neutralino production in this paper. These examples of BSM production of Higgs bosons motivate an inclusive search for anomalous Higgs boson production that is broadly sensitive to a wide range of supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios. Similar searches for supersymmetric particles decaying to Higgs bosons have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in the past using 8 TeV collision data and can be found in references [10][11][12].",

Photon candidates are selected by imposing \"loose\" requirements on the shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter, the ratio of energy measured in the HCAL to the energy measured in the ECAL, and the isolation in a cone around the direction of the photon momentum [19]. The isolation requirement is corrected for the effect of multiple proton collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossing (pileup) by subtracting the average energy from pileup deposited in the isolation cone, estimated by averaging the energy density over the event. Furthermore, photon candidates are rejected if they match an electron candidate that is not consistent with one leg of a conversion. The photon selection efficiency was measured to be about 90% [20] using tag and probe methods. The measured energy of photons is corrected for clustering and local geometric effects using an energy regression trained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation [19]. This regression gives a significant improvement in the energy resolution of the photons (about 30%) and provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the energy measurement that is used to separate events into high-and low-resolution categories.",

A loose working point is chosen that yields an efficiency above 80% and a mistag rate for light-flavor jets that is approximately 10%. The negative vector sum of the reconstructed p T of all PF candidates in an event defines the missing transverse momentum p miss T in the event, and its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . Events with detector-and beam-related noise that can mimic event topologies with high energy and large p miss T are filtered out by use of dedicated noise reduction algorithms [25][26][27].",

            "text": "Simulated event samples are used to model the SM Higgs backgrounds in the search regions, and to calculate the selection efficiencies for SUSY signal models. Samples of SM Higgs production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, associated production with a W or a Z boson, bbH, and ttH are generated using the nextto-leading order (NLO) MadGraph5_amc@nlo v2.2.2 [28] event generator. The Higgs mass is assumed to be 125.0 GeV for the simulated event samples and is within the uncertainty of the currently best measured value [29]. For the gluon fusion production mode, the sample is generated with up to two extra partons to model initial-state radiation (ISR) calculated at the matrix element level with NLO accuracy with the matching scheme described in reference [30]. The SUSY signal MC samples are generated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo at leading order accuracy with up to two extra partons in the matrix element calculations with the matching scheme described in reference [31]. In both cases, pythia v8.2 [32] is used to model the fragmentation and parton showering with the CUETP8M1 tune [33]. The NNPDF3.0LO and NNPDF3.0NLO [34] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for the LO and NLO accuracy generators respectively. The SM Higgs background and bottom squark pair-production signal samples are simulated using a Geant4-based model [35] of the CMS detector, while the chargino-neutralino and neutralino-pair production signal samples are simulated with the CMS fast simulation package [36]. While generally providing an accurate description, the fast simulation does sometimes yield inaccurate predictions of the missing transverse momentum tail. These inaccuracies are accounted for by larger systematic uncertainties for the signal yield prediction in the relevant phase space estimated as the difference between signal yields predicted using the generator level missing transverse momentum and the missing transverse momentum reconstructed based on the fast simulation. All simulated events include the effects of pileup and are processed with the same chain of reconstruction programs used for collision data.",

All parameters of the function are unconstrained in the fit. The functional form of the model used for each search region bin is selected on the basis of its Akaike information criterion (AIC) score [45], which quantifies the trade-off between goodness-of- fit and model complexity. Each functional form is tested for fit biases with respect to a set of alternative models, all of which Table 2 The predicted yields for an example SUSY signal and the SM Higgs boson background processes for each search region are shown for an integrated luminosity corresponding to 35.9 fb \u22121 .

The parameters of each double Crystal Ball function are held constant in the signal extraction fit procedure, with the exception of the parameter controlling the location of the peak, which is discussed further in Section 6 below. The normalization of the SM Higgs boson background in each bin is predicted from the MC simulation and is constrained to that value in the fit within uncertainties. For the HighRes and LowRes categories, bins in the M R and R 2 variables are fitted simultaneously. For a given search bin, the relative yields in the HighRes and LowRes categories are observed in the simulation to be largely process independent and are therefore constrained according to the simulation prediction. Based on these independent fits in each search bin, we obtain a model-independent search result, which can be used to evaluate whether the yield in any bin exhibits a statistically significant deviation from the background prediction. We also perform a combined simultaneous fit using all of the search bins, to test specific SUSY simplified model signal hypotheses. In the combined fit, the yield in each bin for the SM Higgs background and the signal model under test are constrained to the MC simulation predictions within uncertainties. These uncertainties are modeled by use of nuisance parameters that account for various theoretical and instrumental uncertainties that can affect the SM Higgs boson background and SUSY signal normalization, and are profiled in the fit. A more detailed discussion of systematic uncertainties can be found below in Section 6. The MC simulation predictions for the SM Higgs boson background normalization are shown in Table 2 for each bin in the search region.",

This is propagated by profiling the normalization and shape parameters of the nonresonant background functional form in an unconstrained way. The second and subdominant type of systematic uncertainty is in the predictions of the SM Higgs background in the various search bins. These shape uncertainties are propagated through the use of several independent nuisance parameters, where both theoretical and instrumental effects are taken into account. The nuisance parameters are constrained in the fit using log-normal prior functions, whose width reflects the size of the systematic uncertainty. The independent systematic effects considered include missing higherorder corrections, PDFs, trigger and selection efficiencies, jet energy scale uncertainties, b tagging efficiencies, and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The uncertainty due to jet energy resolution uncertainties were also estimated and were found to be negligible. The typical size of these effects on the expected limit is summarized in Table 3. Due to effects of pileup and transparency loss in the ECAL crystals, we observe some simulation mismodeling of the estimated mass resolution, which results in a systematic uncertainty of 10-24% in the prediction of the SM Higgs background and SUSY signal yields in the HighRes and LowRes event categories. The systematic uncertainty in the photon energy scale is implemented as a Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameter that shifts the Higgs boson mass peak position, constrained in the fit to lie within approximately 1% of the nominal Higgs boson mass observed in simulation. The systematic uncertainty for the modeling Table 4 The nonresonant background yields, SM Higgs boson background yields, best fit signal yields, and observed local significance in units of standard deviations (\u03c3 ) are shown for the signal plus background fit in each search region bin.

For chargino-neutralino and neutralino-pair production signal processes, the fast simulation was used to predict signal yields and an additional systematic uncertainty is propagated for inaccuracies in the modeling of the missing transverse momentum tail.

Diagrams of these simplified models are shown in Fig. 1. In the case of bottom squark pair production, we consider the scenario where the bottom squark decays to a bottom quark and the next-to-lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 2 ), and the \u03c7 0 2 decays to a Higgs boson and the LSP ( \u03c7 0 1 ), and the production cross sections are computed at NLO plus next-to-leading-log (NLL) precision with all the other sparticles assumed to be heavy and decoupled [38][39][40][41][42][43]. We restrict ourselves to the scenario where the mass splitting between the \u03c7 0 2 and the \u03c7 0 1 is 130 GeV, slightly above threshold to produce an on-shell Higgs boson. In the case of chargino-neutralino production, we consider two different scenarios.

            "text": "A search for anomalous Higgs boson production through decays of supersymmetric particles is performed with the proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The non-resonant background is estimated through a fit to the diphoton mass distribution in data, while the SM Higgs background is predicted using simulation. We interpret the results in terms of production cross section limits on simplified models of bottom squark pair production and chargino-neutralino production. We exclude bottom squark masses below 450 GeV for bottom squarks decaying to a bottom quark, a Higgs boson, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) for LSP masses below 250 GeV and assuming a mass splitting between the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 of 130 GeV. For wino-like chargino-neutralino production, we improved the search sensitivity by a factor of two with respect to previous results [11] and we exclude charginos with mass below 170 GeV for LSP masses below 25 GeV. In the GMSB scenario, we exclude charginos with mass below 205 GeV for neutralinos decaying to a Higgs boson and a goldstino LSP ( G) with 100% branching fraction. Finally, we exclude charginos with mass below 130 GeV for the case where the branching fractions of the \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 H G and \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z G decays are 50% each.",
