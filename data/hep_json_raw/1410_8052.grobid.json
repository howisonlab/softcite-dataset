This corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 10.4 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The data are corrected for detector effects and presented in bins of dimuon rapidity and mass. The variable \u03c6 * \u03b7 probes the same physical effects as the Z/\u03b3 * boson transverse momentum, but is less susceptible to the effects of experimental resolution and efficiency. These are the first measurements at any collider of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions for dilepton masses away from the Z \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 boson mass peak. The data are compared to QCD predictions based on the resummation of multiple soft gluons. PACS numbers: 12.38.Qk,13.85.Qk,14.70.Hp Drell-Yan lepton pairs are produced at hadron colliders via quark-antiquark annihilation and may be produced with a non-zero momentum in the plane transverse to the beam direction p \u2113\u2113 T (\u2113 = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ) due to QCD radiation from the incoming partons. Measurements of p \u2113\u2113 T and related variables in events containing Drell-Yan lepton pairs thus allow models of initial state QCD radiation to be tested. Such models are an important component in the phenomenological interpretation of almost all experimental measurements and in searches for new physics at hadron colliders.",

To increase the event selection efficiency in this low mass region and to reduce any kinematic bias on the distribution of \u03c6 * \u03b7 , the selection criteria are relaxed: we require the leading muon to satisfy p T > 15 GeV, but allow the second muon to satisfy p T > 10 GeV. The dominant backgrounds in the 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV sample arise from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 + and bin migration in M \u2113\u2113 . Background from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 + events containing hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons is suppressed by applying isolation criteria on the muon candidates that are more stringent than those used for the 70 < M \u2113\u2113 < 110 GeV event sample. In particular, an additional requirement is placed on the sum of the E T of calorimeter clusters within a cone \u2206R < 0.1 around the muon track. The fraction of the selected event sample arising from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 + background is estimated to be 5.2%. The number of selected events that originate close to the Z boson mass peak but are reconstructed with 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV due to FSR is reduced by excluding events that contain an isolated photon candidate with p T > 15 GeV. Bin migration in M \u2113\u2113 from the Z boson mass peak can also arise from events in which the p T of one of the muon candidates is underestimated. This is suppressed using a \"pseudo-mass\" variable, M pseudo : the invariant mass of the muon pair is recalculated having set the magnitude of the p T of the lower p T muon to be equal to that of the higher p T muon. This is under the hypothesis that if an event originates close to the Z boson mass peak, but is reconstructed with 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV, the p T of the lower p T muon candidate has been underestimated. Events arising from bin migration in M \u2113\u2113 tend to have large values of M pseudo and candidate events are required to satisfy M pseudo < 75 GeV. This requirement rejects only 2% of Drell-Yan dimuon events with 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV at the generator level. The fraction of the selected event sample arising from Drell-Yan dimuon events for which the Born level Z/\u03b3 * boson propagator mass is greater than 70 GeV is estimated to be 1.3%.

Particular care has been taken in the choice of muon identification criteria in order to minimize such modulations and also to ensure that such modulations are well simulated in the MC. For example, the inclusion of muon candidates identified in the calorimeter reduces the effect of gaps between modules in the outer muon system. Nevertheless, accurate modeling of the residual inefficiencies in the inter-module regions is verified, since this is particularly important in this measurement; regions of low efficiency that are back-to-back in \u03c6 cause the efficiency to modulate as a function of \u03c6 * \u03b7 . Accurate modeling of the angular resolution of the central tracking detectors is another crucial aspect of this analysis.

            "text": "[1] are shown [25]. Given that the experimental corrections are very different in the two channels, the consistency of the dielectron and dimuon measurements represents a powerful cross check of the corrected distributions. Figure 4 shows for 70 < M \u2113\u2113 < 110 GeV the ratio of the corrected dimuon data to the NNLL+NLO predictions of Ref. [8]. Figures 3 and 4 show that the theoretical uncertainties arising from QCD scale variations and PDFs are large compared to the experimental uncertainties. Within the quoted uncertainties both predictions are consistent with the corrected data. Figure 5 shows the ratio of the (1/\u03c3)(d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 ) distribution in the central rapidity region (|y| < 1) to that in the forward rapidity region (1 < |y| < 2). The corrected dimuon data are compared to the predictions from ResBos [10] and from the NNLL+NLO calculations [8]. Figure 5 shows that the theoretical uncertainties largely cancel in this ratio and that the predictions are consistent with the data. Figure 6 shows the normalized dimuon \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions (1/\u03c3) \u00d7 (d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 ) in two bins of |y|, corrected to the particle level with kinematic requirements: 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV, and for both muons |\u03b7| < 2. The leading muon is required to satisfy p T > 15 GeV and the second muon is required to satisfy p T > 10 GeV. In addition, events are required at particle level to contain no FSR photon with transverse energy E \u03b3 T > 14 GeV. The corrected data are compared to predictions from ResBos [10] with the same particle-level kinematic cuts applied. Figure 7 shows the ratio of the corrected \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions to the ResBos predictions for 30 < M \u2113\u2113 < 60 GeV. Figure 8 shows the ratio of the same data to the NNLL+NLO predictions of Ref. [8,27]. At high values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 the prediction from ResBos agrees less well with data than is the case in the region of the Z boson mass peak. A known deficiency of the ResBos prediction for \u03c6 * \u03b7 > 0.5 in the low mass region is the absence of the NNLO correction factor for the photon exchange diagram. Figure 9 shows the normalized dimuon \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions (1/\u03c3) \u00d7 (d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 ), corrected to the particle level with kinematic requirements: 160 < M \u2113\u2113 < 300 GeV and 300 < M \u2113\u2113 < 500 GeV, and for both muons p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2. The data are compared to predictions from ResBos with the same particle-level kinematic requirements applied. Figure 10 shows the ratios of the corrected \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions to the ResBos predictions. Within the fairly large statistical uncertainties, the predictions are consistent with the corrected data. As pointed out above there is no NNLO correction factor for the photon exchange diagram in ResBos.",
