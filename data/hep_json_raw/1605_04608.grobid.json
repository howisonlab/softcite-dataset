            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is an extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics that is motivated by several considerations, including the gauge hierarchy problem [9][10][11][12][13][14], the existence of astrophysical dark matter [15][16][17], and the possibility of gauge coupling constant unification at high energy [18][19][20][21][22]. In SUSY models, each SM particle has a corresponding supersymmetric partner (or partners) whose spin differs by one-half, such that fermions are mapped to bosons and vice versa. Gauge quantum numbers are preserved by this symmetry, and to preserve degrees of freedom, a SM spin-1/2 Dirac particle, such as the top quark, has two spin-0 partners, the top squarks. The SUSY partner of the (spin-1) gluon, the massless mediator of the strong interactions in the SM, is the spin-1/2 gluino. In R-parity-conserving models [23,24], SUSY particles are produced in pairs, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. If the LSP is the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ), an electrically neutral mixture of the SUSY partners of the neutral electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, then it has weak interactions only and can in principle account for some or all of the dark matter.",

This outcome can be avoided within the framework of the SM only with extreme fine tuning of the bare Higgs mass parameter, a situation that is regarded as unnatural, although not excluded. This problem suggests that additional symmetries and associated degrees of freedom may be present that ameliorate these effects. So-called natural SUSY models [31][32][33][34], in which sufficiently light SUSY partners are present, are a major focus of current new physics searches at the CERN LHC. In natural models, several of the SUSY partners are constrained to be light [33]: both top squarks, t L and t R , which have the same electroweak couplings as the left-(L) and right-(R) handed top quarks, respectively; the bottom squark with L-handed couplings ( b L ); the gluino ( g); and the Higgsinos ( h). While the gluino mass is not constrained by naturalness considerations as strongly as that of the lighter top squark mass eigenstate, t 1 , the cross section for gluino pair production is substantially larger than that for top squark pair production, for a given mass. As a consequence, the two types of searches can have comparable sensitivity to these models. Both types of searches are currently of intense interest, and CMS and ATLAS data taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV have provided significant constraints [35] on natural SUSY scenarios. This study uses the first LHC proton-proton collision data taken by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV to search for gluino pair production. Searches targeting this process in the single-lepton final state using 8 TeV data have been performed by both ATLAS [36,37] and CMS [38]. For m g = 1.5 TeV, somewhat above the highest gluino masses excluded at \u221a s = 8 TeV, the cross section for gluino pair production increases dramatically with center-of-mass energy, from about 0.4 fb at \u221a s = 8 TeV to about 14 fb at \u221a s = 13 TeV [39].",

As a consequence, the sensitivity of this search can be significantly extended with respect to searches performed at \u221a s = 8 TeV, even though the 13 TeV data sample has an integrated luminosity of only 2.3 fb \u22121 , roughly one-tenth of that acquired at 8 TeV. The search targets gluino pair production with g \u2192 tt \u03c7 0 1 , which arises from g \u2192 t 1 t, where the top squark is produced either on or off mass shell. The off-mass-shell scenario is shown in figure 1 (left) and is often designated T1tttt [41] in simplified model scenarios [42][43][44]. Results are also obtained for scenarios with on-shell top squark masses. This scenario is shown in figure 1 (right) and will be denoted by T5tttt. (For this scenario, the small contribution from the direct production of top squark pairs is also taken into account.) Regardless of whether the top squark is produced on or off mass shell, the final state is characterized by a large number of jets, four of which are b jets from top quark decays. Depending on the decay modes of the accompanying W bosons, a range of lepton multiplicities is possible; we focus here on the single-lepton final state, where the lepton is either an electron or a muon. Because the two neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 1 ) are undetected, their production in SUSY events typically gives rise to a large amount of missing (unobserved) momentum, whose value in the direction transverse to the beam axis can be inferred from the momenta of the observed particles. The missing transverse momentum, p miss T , is a key element of searches for R-parity-conserving SUSY, and its magnitude is denoted by E miss T .",

            "text": "A challenge in performing searches for SUSY particles is obtaining sufficient sensitivity to the signal, while at the same time understanding the background contribution from SM processes in a robust manner. This analysis is designed such that the background in the signal regions arises largely from a single process, dilepton tt production, in which both W bosons from t \u2192 bW + decay leptonically, but only one lepton satisfies the criteria associated with identification, the minimum transverse momentum (p T ) requirement, and isolation from other energy in the event. The search signature is characterized not only by the presence of high-p T jets and b-tagged jets, an isolated high-p T lepton, and large E miss T , but also by additional kinematic variables. Apart from resolution effects, the transverse mass of the lepton + p miss T system, m T , is bounded above by m W for events with a single leptonically decaying W, and this variable is very effective in suppressing the otherwise dominant single-lepton tt background. The quantity M J , the scalar sum of the masses of large-radius jets, is used both to characterize the mass and energy scale of the event, providing discrimination between signal and background, and as a key part of the background estimation. A property of M J exploited in this analysis is that, for the dominant background, this variable is nearly uncorrelated with m T . Because of the absence of correlation between M J and m T , the background shape at high m T , including the signal region, can be measured to a very good approximation using a low-m T control sample. The quantity M J was first discussed in phenomenological studies, for example, in refs. [45][46][47]. Similar variables have been used by ATLAS for SUSY searches in all-hadronic final states using 8 TeV data [48,49]. We have presented studies of basic M J properties and performance using early 13 TeV data [50].",

The T1tttt(1500,100) model, with masses m g = 1500 GeV and m \u03c7 0 1 = 100 GeV, corresponds to a scenario with a large mass splitting (referred to as non-compressed, or NC) between the gluino and the neutralino. This mass combination probes the sensitivity of the analysis to a low cross section (14 fb) process that has a hard E miss T spectrum, which results in a relatively high signal efficiency. The T1tttt(1200,800) model, with masses m g = 1200 GeV and m \u03c7 0 1 = 800 GeV, corresponds to a scenario with a small mass splitting (referred to as compressed, or C) between the gluino and the neutralino. Here the cross section is much higher (86 fb) because the gluino mass is lower than for the T1tttt(1500,100) model, but the sensitivity suffers from a low signal efficiency due to the soft E miss T spectrum. Finally, to model the presence of additional proton-proton collisions from the same or adjacent beam crossing as the primary hard-scattering process (\"pileup\" interactions), the simulated events are overlaid with multiple minimum bias events, which are also generated with the pythia 8.205 generator with the underlying event model based on the CUETP8M1 tune. The distribution of the number of overlaid minimum bias events is broad and peaks in the range 10-15.",

To ensure high trigger efficiency with respect to the offline definition of lepton isolation described in the previous section (mini-isolation), we designed these triggers with very loose lepton isolation requirements and fixed the isolation cone size to R = 0.2. For events passing the offline selection, the total trigger efficiencies, measured in data control samples that are independently triggered, are found to be (95.1 \u00b1 1.1)% for the muon channel and (94.1 \u00b1 1.2)% for the electron channel and are independent of the analysis variables within the uncertainties.

We select events with exactly one isolated charged lepton (an electron or a muon), H T > 500 GeV, E miss T > 200 GeV, and at least six jets, at least one of which is b-tagged. After this set of requirements, referred in the following as the baseline selection, more than 80% of the remaining SM background arises from tt production. The contributions from events with a single top quark or a W boson in association with jets are each about 6-7%. The background from QCD multijet events after the baseline selection is negligible due to the combination of leptonic, E miss T , and N jets requirements. After the baseline selection requirements are applied, events are binned in several other kinematic variables, both to increase the signal sensitivity and to define control regions, as described in section 6.1. To illustrate the effect of additional requirements, than m \u03c7 0 1 , more than half of the events passing the lepton requirement lie in the signal region. For compressed spectrum models, where m \u03c7 0 1 \u2248 m g \u2212 2m t , the M J , H T , and E miss T spectra become much softer and, as a result, only 5-10% of the single-lepton signal events are selected. As shown in figure 3, backgrounds with a single W boson decaying leptonically are strongly suppressed after the m T > 140 GeV requirement, so the total SM background in the signal region is dominated by dilepton tt events. This dilepton background falls into two categories, which make roughly equal contributions. The first involves an identified electron or muon and a hadronically decaying \u03c4 from W decay. The second source involves two leptons, each of which is an electron or a muon. One of the leptons fails to satisfy the lepton selection criteria, which include the p T and isolation requirements. This missed lepton can be produced either directly or indirectly in W decay, where in the indirect case the lepton is the daughter of a \u03c4 .    ",

This effect is illustrated in figure 5, which compares the N jets and M J distributions of single-lepton and dilepton tt events at high and low m T after the baseline selection is applied. Since we require at least 6 jets, single-lepton tt events must have at least 2 ISR jets and dilepton tt events must have at least 4. In this regime, the probability of additional ISR jets is similar for events with a given number of partons of similar momenta, and, as a result, the number of objects contributing to M J (jets plus the reconstructed lepton) is comparable in 1 and 2 tt events. When these ISR jets overlap with the top quark decay products, the masses of the resulting large-R jets are dominated by the accidental overlap and, thus, the shapes of the M J distribution of 1 and 2 tt events become more similar. This is the case for M J > 250 GeV, where figure 5 (right) shows that the distributions of the 1 and 2 tt backgrounds have nearly the same shape, and the low-m T to high-m T extrapolation is warranted.",

We find that the main source of 1 tt events in the high-m T region is jet energy mismeasurement. We study the impact of mismodeling the size of this contribution by smearing the jet energies by an additional 50% with respect to the jet energy resolution measured in data [70] and calculating the corresponding shift in \u03ba. To ensure that there are no further significant differences between the M J shapes of events reconstructed with one or two leptons, we also calculate the shift in \u03ba due to jet energy corrections, potential ISR p T and top quark p T mismodeling, as well as the amount of non-tt background. Even though each of these can alone have a significant effect on the M J shape, the \u03ba factor, as a double ratio, remains largely unaffected (table 2). Including these uncertainties in the likelihood fit produces a negligible contribution to the total uncertainty.  Figure 8 shows the two-dimensional distribution of the data in the m T -M J plane after the baseline selection, but with the additional requirement N b \u2265 2. The baseline requirements include E miss T > 200 GeV and N jets \u2265 6, but no further event selection is applied. For comparison, the plot also shows the expected total SM background based on simulation, as well as a particular sample of the expected signal distribution. The overall distribution of events in data is consistent with the background expectation, where the majority of events are concentrated at low m T and M J . In R4, the nominal signal region, we observe only two events in data, while, as shown in table 3, the predicted SM background is about 5 events. The T1tttt(1500,100) (NC) model would be expected to contribute 5 additional events to R4.",

            "text": "In the context of natural SUSY models, it is important to extend the interpretation to scenarios in which the top squark is lighter than the gluino. Rather than considering a large set of models with independently varying top squark masses, we consider the extreme case in which the top squark has approximately the smallest mass consistent with two-body decay, m t 1 \u2248 m t + m \u03c7 0 1 , for a range of gluino and neutralino masses. The decay kinematics for such extreme, compressed mass spectrum models correspond to the lowest signal efficiency for given values of m g and m \u03c7 0 1 , because the top quark and the \u03c7 0 1 are produced at rest in the top squark frame. As a consequence, the excluded signal cross section for fixed values of m g and m \u03c7 0 1 and with m g > m t 1 \u2265 m t + m \u03c7 0 1 is minimized around this extreme model point. For physical consistency, the signal model used in this study, both in the fit procedure and in the theoretical cross section used to obtain mass limits, includes not only gluino-pair production, but also direct t 1 t 1 production. However, the effect of the direct top squark contribution on the results is small, 2% for m \u03c7 0 1 > 400 GeV and up to 20% for low values of m \u03c7 0 1 . Figure 11 shows the excluded region in the m g -m \u03c7 0 1 plane for this combined model with both gluino-mediated top squark production and direct top squark pair production. The top squark mass is assumed to be 175 GeV above that of the neutralino. For most of the excluded region, the boundary is close to that obtained for the T1tttt model, showing that there is only a weak sensitivity to the value of the top squark mass. The uncertainty on the boundary of the excluded region for the T5tttt model is similar to that shown for the T1tttt model in figure 10. For m \u03c7 0 1 > 150 GeV, the excluded value of m g is typically within 60 GeV of that excluded for T1tttt. Models that have low values of m \u03c7 0 1 show a reduced sensitivity because the neutralino carries very little momentum, reducing the value of m T . In this kinematic region, the sensitivity to the signal is dominated by the events that have at least two leptonic W boson decays, which produce additional E miss T , as well as a tail in the m T distribution. Although such dilepton events are nominally excluded in the analysis, a significant number of these signal events escape the dilepton veto. These events include both W decays to \u03c4 leptons that decay hadronically, and W decays to electrons or muons that are below kinematic thresholds or are outside of the detector acceptance. ",

Under the assumption of a 100% branching fraction to this final state, the cross section limit for each model point is compared with the theoretical cross section to determine the excluded particle masses. Gluinos with a mass below 1600 GeV are excluded at a 95% CL for scenarios with low \u03c7 0 1 mass, and neutralinos with a mass below 800 GeV are excluded for a gluino mass of about 1300 GeV.
