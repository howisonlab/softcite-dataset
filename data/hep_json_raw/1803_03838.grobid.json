The search is performed using the data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC during 2016 in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No excess is observed in data with regard to background expectations. Results are interpreted in scenarios of physics beyond the standard model. Limits at 95% confidence level on production cross sections are set at 0.9 fb (63 fb) for spin-1 W bosons, included in the heavy vector triplet model, with mass 4.0 TeV (1.0 TeV), and at 0.5 fb (40 fb) for spin-2 bulk gravitons with mass 4.0 TeV (1.0 TeV). Lower limits are set on the masses of W bosons in the context of two versions of the heavy vector triplet model of 3.1 TeV and 3.4 TeV, respectively.",

In the four-dimensional bulk space, two branes are hypothesized: one whose fundamental scale is the Planck scale, and one at the TeV scale, where the standard model (SM) particles are confined. Spin-2 gravitons, expected to have a mass at the TeV scale, are allowed to propagate from the Planck brane to the TeV brane via the warped fourth spatial dimension. In the bulk warped extra dimension model, the SM particles can also propagate through the bulk multidimensional space. In this context, spin-2 bulk gravitons can be produced at a significant rate via gluon fusion, and can decay into a pair of vector bosons [5]. Two parameters are used to describe the model: the mass of the proposed spin-2 particle and k = k/M Pl , where k is the curvature parameter of the five-dimensional space-time metric, and M Pl = M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass.",

The heavy vector triplet (HVT) model [6] provides a framework for many BSM models, in particular those where heavy spin-1 partners of the vector bosons (W and Z bosons) [7,8] are expected to be weakly coupled to SM particles (referred to as the \"HVT model A\" scenario), and the composite Higgs model [9,10], where exotic vector bosons are strongly coupled to ordinary particles (the \"HVT model B\" scenario). Both scenarios are described by three Lagrangian parameters: the couplings of spin-1 particles to SM fermions (c F ) and to SM bosons (c H ), and the strength of the interaction (g V ). In the HVT model A scenario, g V = 1, c F = \u22121.316, and c H = \u22120.556; in HVT model B, g V = 3, c F = 1.024, and c H = 0.976 [6]. Previous searches performed at the CERN LHC looking for evidence for these models have set limits on the production cross section of the new heavy bosons (46.1 fb at a mass of 1.4 TeV and 0.7 fb at a mass of 4.1 TeV), and mass lower limits of 3.3 TeV (3.6 TeV) for HVT model A (model B) [11][12][13][14][15].",

The vector bosons are mostly produced in a back-to-back topology with large Lorentz boosts because of the large mass of the new particle (on the order of 1 TeV); this implies that the two quarks originating from the vector boson decay are close enough to be reconstructed within one single large-cone jet, an approach that, in this kinematic region, is more efficient than building the vector boson candidate as two distinct standard jets. Since neutrinos do not leave any visible signature in the detector, they are reconstructed as a large amount of missing transverse momentum ( p miss T ) recoiling against the hadronic component. The sensitivity of the search is enhanced by the relatively high branching fraction of the Z boson into neutrinos (20%) and of the other vector boson into a pair of quarks (\u224870%). Jet substructure techniques [16] are exploited to improve the discrimination between signal events and SM background processes.",

Both processes are generated at leading order (LO) with the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.2.2 [19] matrix element Monte Carlo (MC) generator for a range of different mass hypotheses for the resonances from 0.6 to 4.5 TeV. Signals are generated assuming the resonances have negligible width (0.1% of their masses) compared to the experimental resolution (4-8% depending on their masses); this assumption is the so-called \"narrow-width approximation\". The actual width of the spin-2 resonances may be larger depending on the value of the curvature parameter k in the model [1,2], but this effect is only significant for values of k larger than 1, which are not considered in this analysis. For the background, events with a vector boson produced with additional partons are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in \u03b1 S with MadGraph5 amc@nlo, using the FxFx merging scheme [20]. Electroweak corrections at NLO [21] are applied to these samples as a function of the transverse momentum p T of the vector bosons. Top quarkantiquark (tt) and single top quark events are simulated at NLO in the five-flavor scheme with powheg v2 [22][23][24][25][26]. Inclusive diboson production (WW, WZ, ZZ) is considered as well, and generated with pythia 8.212 [27] at LO. The hadronization and fragmentation steps of all simulated samples are handled by pythia with the CUETP8M1 [28] tune. The NNPDF3.1 [29] parton distribution functions are used in the simulations. The effect of additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) is accounted for by adding simulated minimum bias events to the hard interaction. The frequency distributions of the pileup events are reweighted to match those observed in data. The simulation of the CMS detector is performed with Geant4 [30].",

The raw jet energies are further corrected to establish a relative uniform response of the calorimeter in \u03b7 and a calibrated absolute response in p T [34]. Charged particles not associated to the primary vertex are removed from the jet [35]. An additional offset correction is applied to the jet energies to subtract the contribution from pileup [35]. The jet energy scale (JES) is calculated using a detailed MC simulation of the detector, and further adjusted using the p T balance in dijet, multijet, photon+jet and leptonically decaying Z+jet events in data [36]. A smearing procedure has been applied to jets in the simulated samples in order to account for small differences between the jet momentum resolutions observed in simulation and in data.

Finally, the jet mass is corrected with p T -dependent factors [42] to account for the small difference observed in the reconstructed vector boson mass between data and simulated events in a tt control sample, in which one W boson, originating from the top or antitop quark, decays into leptons and the other W boson decays hadronically.",

To avoid inefficiencies due to the prescaling of the triggers during high-luminosity LHC operation, several triggers are used, variously requiring H miss T or p miss T > 90, 110, 120 GeV, or p miss T > 170 GeV, in order to have at least one nonprescaled trigger at any given time. The p miss T trigger efficiency has been measured with data events satisfying one or more single-muon triggers. A W leptonic decay topology is selected (W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd), since it ensures the presence of p miss T in the event, due to the neutrino. One muon identified by offline algorithms is required: this not only guarantees that the sample does not overlap with the search region of the analysis (where events with muons are rejected), but also reduces the contamination from particles or jets misidentified as leptons at the trigger level. The additional condition of having at least one AK8 jet is applied, in order to select events with a topology similar to that of the considered search. The combination of p miss T triggers reaches a plateau in efficiency of 96% around p miss T > 200 GeV, which is chosen as the minimum p miss T threshold for the event selection. An independent efficiency measurement has been performed using a data set satisfying single-electron triggers, and the discrepancy with the result based on the muon data set is taken as a systematic uncertainty, which amounts to 1%.",

Since the analysis searches for a diboson resonance where one vector boson decays hadronically, the mass of the jet candidate is expected to lie within a window around the nominal masses of the W and Z bosons, chosen to be between 65 and 105 GeV. Two control regions are defined that are expected to be depleted in signal: the \"low sideband\", which lies in the m j range 30-65 GeV, and the \"high sideband\", with m j above 135 GeV. These sidebands play a crucial role in the background estimation. The region 105-135 GeV is excluded from the sideband selections in order to not overlap with other diboson searches aiming at a final state containing a hadronically decaying Higgs boson. This exclusion allows the results to be combined with those of other searches in a straightforward manner. The region under 30 GeV is discarded, since jets are not reconstructed sufficiently well in this region.",

            "text": "A search has been made for heavy diboson resonances (WZ, ZZ) decaying into a pair of vector bosons, one of which is a Z boson decaying into \u03bd\u03bd and the other is a W or Z boson that decays into qq. The data were collected by the CMS detector from proton-proton collisions produced at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. In this analysis, the hadronically decaying W or Z boson is reconstructed as a large-cone jet. The invisible decay of the Z boson manifests itself as a large amount of missing transverse momentum recoiling against the jet. The transverse components of the VZ system momentum are used to define the transverse mass variable, where a search for a localized excess is performed. The expected background is described with a hybrid data/simulation approach that takes advantage of data sidebands to predict the background normalization and shape in the signal region. To improve the discovery potential, two purity categories are defined, based on a jet substructure observable. An unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed. No excess is observed in data compared to standard model predictions.  Figure 4. The observed and expected limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction \u03c3B(W \u2192 W had Z inv ) for a spin-1 HVT signal hypothesis (left) and \u03c3B(G \u2192 Z had Z inv ) for a spin-2 bulk graviton signal hypothesis (right), as a function of the W and G mass, respectively. The low-and high-purity categories have been combined. The inner and outer shaded bands indicate the 68% and 95% uncertainty intervals associated with the expected limits. Theoretical predictions are shown for: (left) the two HVT models considered, model A (blue dotted-and-dashed line) and model B (red solid line), and (right) a graviton model with a curvature parameter of k = 0.5 (violet solid line).",
