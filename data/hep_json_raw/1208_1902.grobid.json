Because of their large masses heavy quarks are mainly produced via initial hard parton-parton collisions, even at low transverse momenta p T . Therefore, heavy-flavor production cross sections constitute a prime benchmark for perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. Furthermore, heavy-flavor measurements in pp collisions provide a mandatory baseline for corresponding studies in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Heavy quark observables are sensitive to the properties of the strongly interacting partonic medium which is produced in such collisions.",

Charged particle tracks reconstructed in the TPC and ITS were propagated towards the outer detectors using a Kalman filter approach [16]. Geometrical matching was applied to associate tracks with hits in the outer detectors. To guarantee good particle identification based on the specific dE/dx in the TPC, tracks were required to include a minimum number of 80 clusters used for the energy loss calculation. A cut on the number of clusters for tracking is used to enhance the electron/pion separation. The stringent request for at least 120 clusters from the maximum of 159 enhances electrons relative to hadrons. In total, at least four ITS hits were required to be associated with a track. A cut on the distance of closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis (xy) as well as in the beam direction (z) was applied to reject background tracks and non-primary tracks. Differently from the heavy-flavor electron analysis [12], the pseudorapidity range was extended to |\u03b7| < 0.8, and tracks were required to be associated with hits in both layers of the SPD in order to minimize the contribution from tracks with randomly associated hits in the first pixel layer. The latter criterion provides a better measurement of the track's transverse impact parameter d 0 , i.e. the DCA to the primary collision vertex in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, where the sign of d 0 is attributed on the basis of the relative position of primary vertex and the track prolongation in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the transverse momentum vector of the track.",

Consequently, electron tracks from semileptonic beauty hadron decays feature a rather broad d 0 distribution, as indicated by simulation studies in Fig. 1(a). Also shown are the d 0 distributions of the main background sources, i.e. electrons from charm hadron decays, from Dalitz and dilepton decays of light mesons, and from photon conversions. These distributions were obtained from a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment using GEANT3 [17]. With the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [18] pp collisions were produced employing the Perugia 0-parameter tuning [19]. The p T shapes of beauty hadron decay electrons from a FONLL pQCD calculation [20] and from PYTHIA are in good agreement. The PYTHIA simulation does not reproduce precisely the p T -differential yields of background sources measured in data. Therefore, the p T distributions of the relevant electron sources in PYTHIA were re-weighted to match the distributions measured with ALICE, prior of propagation through the ALICE apparatus using GEANT3. After the full Monte Carlo simulation, the same event cuts and track selection criteria (including that on d 0 ) as in data were applied. The p T distributions of the backgrounds were normalized by the number of events passing these event selection cuts, corrected for the efficiency to reconstruct a primary vertex. Background electrons surviving these selection criteria were subtracted from the inclusive electron spectrum obtained from data. This approach relies on the availability of the p T -differential cross section measurements of the main background sources.",

In addition, the d 0 resolution measured for charged tracks in data is reproduced within 10% by the Monte Carlo simulation [10]. The difference in the particle multiplicities between data and simulation gives an effect on the primary vertex resolution, which is included in the d 0 resolution as a convolution of the track position and the primary vertex resolution. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that the electron Bremsstrahlung effect is limited to transverse momenta below 1 GeV/c. At higher p T , the particle species dependences of the d 0 resolution is negligible. The possible bias introduced by this optimization is taken into account in the estimation of the systematic uncertainties, by varying substantially the cut value. Fits of the TPC dE/dx distribution in momentum slices indicate that the remaining hadron contamination grows from less than 10 \u22125 at 1 GeV/c to \u224820% at 8 GeV/c before the application of the d 0 cut. Since hadrons originate from the primary collision vertex, the latter cut reduces the remaining hadron contamination to less than 3% even at the highest p T considered here. The electron background from sources other than beauty hadron decays was estimated based on the method described above. In Fig. 3 the raw electron yield, as well as the non-beauty electron background yield, which is subtracted in the analysis, are shown after the application of the track selection criteria. At p T = 1 GeV/c, the background contributions from charm hadron decays, light meson decays, and photon conversions are approximately equal and S/B is \u2248 1/3. At p T = 8 GeV/c, the background originates mostly from charm hadron decays and S/B is \u2248 5.",

The statistical and systematic uncertainties of two measurements are largely uncorrelated, but the extrapolation uncertainties using the same theoretical model (FONLL) are correlated. The weights, defined using the statistical and the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties, and the correlated extrapolation uncertainties, are calculated as 0.499 for the measurement using semileptonic beauty hadron decays and 0.501 for that using non-prompt J/\u03c8 mesons.

After subtraction of the contribution from beauty hadron decays (see above) the resulting production cross section of electrons from charm hadron decays was converted into a charm production cross section applying the same extrapolation method as for beauty. With the branching ratio BR H c \u2192e = 0.096 \u00b1 0.004 [25], at mid-rapidity the charm production cross section per unit rapidity is d\u03c3 cc /dy = 1.2 \u00b1 0.2(stat) \u00b1 0.6(sys) +0. In summary, invariant production cross sections of electrons from beauty and from charm hadron decays were measured in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The agreement between theoretical predictions and the data suggests that FONLL pQCD calculations can reliably describe heavy-flavor production even at low p T in the highest energy hadron collisions accessible in the laboratory today. Furthermore, these results provide a crucial baseline for heavyflavor production studies in the hot and dense matter created in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.",

The differences between the data and the cocktail are consistent with statistical variations. The ra-tio of the signal to background yields, which is obtained by this fit procedure, agrees with that obtained in the present analysis within statistical uncertainties.
