The experiment has been carried out on the SM-3 reactor having a compact active zone of 42x42x35cm 3 and operating on the highly enriched uranium-235 at 90 MW thermal power. We report the results of the Neutrino-4 experiment of measurements of reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum dependence on the distance in the range 6-12 meters from the center of the reactor core. Using the measured spectrum and the distance dependence of antineutrino flux, we performed the model independent analysis of restrictions on the oscillation parameters \u2206m 14 2 and sin 2 2 14 . The method of coherent addition of results of measurements is proposed. It allows us to directly observe the effect of oscillations. We observed the oscillation effect at CL 3.5 in the vicinity of \u2206m 14 2 \u2248 7.26eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 14 \u2248 0.38 .",

            "text": "The hypothesis of oscillation can be verified by direct measurement of the antineutrino flux and spectrum vs. distance at short 6 -12m distances from the reactor core. This is the method of relative measurements and it can be more precise. A detector is supposed to be movable and spectrum sensitive. Our experiment focuses on the task of exploring the possible existence of a sterile neutrino at a certain confidence level or refuting this hypothesis. To detect oscillations to a sterile state, it would be indicative to observe the deviation of flux-distance relation from 1/L 2 dependence. If such a process does occur, it can be described at short distances by the equation: P(\u03bd \u0305 e \u2192 \u03bd \u0305 e ) = 1 \u2212 sin 2 2\u03b8 14 sin 2  ) (1) where \u0305 is antineutrino energy, with oscillation parameters \u2206m 14 2 and sin 2 2 14 being unknown. For the experiment to be conducted, one needs to carry out measurements of the antineutrino flux and spectrum as near as possible to a practically pointlike antineutrino source. We have studied several options for carrying out our new experiments at research reactors in Russia. The research reactors should be employed for performing such experiments, since they possess a compact reactor core, so that a neutrino detector can be placed at a small distance from it. Unfortunately, a research reactor beam hall usually has quite a large background of neutrons and gamma quanta, which makes it difficult to carry out low background experiments. Due to some peculiar characteristics of its construction, reactor SM-3 provides the most 2 favorable conditions to search for neutrino oscillations at short distances [4,5]. However, the SM-3 reactor, as well as other research reactors, is located on the Earth surface, hence, the cosmic background is the major difficulty in considered experiment.",

The main problem of the experiment on the Earth's surface is fast neutrons from cosmic radiation. The elastic scattering of fast neutrons easily imitates an IBD, which is an indicative reaction of antineutrino. Registration of the first (start or prompt) signals from recoil protons imitates registration of a positron. The second (stop or delayed) signal arises in both cases when a neutron is captured by gadolinium. The difference between these prompt signals is in appearance of two gamma quanta, propagating in opposite directions with energy 511 keV each, produced in annihilation of a positron from IBD process. The recoil proton track with high probability is located within the size of one detector section, because its track length is about ~1 mm. Positron free path in an organic scintillator is ~5 cm, hence if its signal is detected in a section then 511 keV gammaquanta could be detected in an adjacent section.",

Unfortunately, a more detailed analysis of that ratio cannot be performed due to low statistical accuracy. Yet, it should be noted, that the measurements of fast neutrons and gamma fluxes in dependence on distance and reactor power were made before installing the detector into passive shielding [6,7]. Absence of noticeable dependence of the background on both distance and reactor power was observed. As a result, we consider that difference in reactor ON-OFF signals appears mostly due to antineutrino flux from operating reactor. That hypothesis is confirmed by the given above ratio of single and multi-section prompt signals typical especially for neutrino events.

Averaged over all distances ratio and its polynomial fit (red curve) are shown in Fig. 9b. It should be noted that deviation of experimental spectrum from calculated one is equal, within experimental accuracy, for different distances. Red curve fits all distance points equally well. Goodness of fits are 77%, 78% and 68% for three distances 7.3m, 9.3m and 11.1m correspondingly. So-called \"bump\" in 5 MeV area is also observed just as in other experiments [8][9][10][11][12], but its amplitude is larger than in experiments at nuclear power plants. If it is connected with U 235 , as assumed in works [13][14][15], then it could be explained by a high content of 235 U (95%) at SM-3 reactor in distinction from effective fission fraction of U 235 56% [11] or 65% [8,9,12] at different industrial reactors. Thus, calculations of reactor flux can be one of the possible reasons for the discrepancy. Taking into consideration 0.934 deficiency for an experimental antineutrino flux with respect to the calculated one, we should discuss not the \u00abbump\u00bb in 5 MeV area, but the \u00abhole\u00bb in 3 MeV area. However, one should take into account influence of oscillations with high m 14 2 because we use 2m interval in analysis.",

The fit with such parameters has the goodness of fit 90%, while fit with a constant equal to one (assumption of no oscillations) has goodness of fit only 27%. It is important to notice that attenuation of sinusoidal process for red curve in area L/E > 2.5 can be explained by taken energy interval 0.5MeV. Considering the smaller interval 0.25MeV we did not obtain increasing of oscillation area of blue experimental, because of insufficient energy resolution of the detector in low energy region. Thus, the data obtained in region L/E > 2.5 do not influence registration of oscillation process. Using first 19 points in analysis, we obtained new 2 and goodness of fit which are shown under the curve in Fig.13. In Fig. 12 and Fig.13 the vertical errors are statistical one, the horizontal errors correspond to the interval of averaging of data.  It should be noticed, that the product of expected spectrum (spectrum of 235 U in assumption of no oscillations) and oscillation factor for each distance are integrated over intervals corresponding to energy intervals in left hand side (1.5MeV -2MeV, 2 -2.5MeV \u2026). However, as shown in Fig. 14, the resulting function of L/E is independent on the initial expected spectrum, hence with high accuracy one can consider that the energy spectrum is cancelled out in right hand side in (2). Also, number of energy bins and averaging step are chosen in convenient way. However, selection of the arbitrary values of the parameters would not results in any significant difference, as shown in Fig.15. Fig. 15.

The deviation of results from linear law, showed in Fig.16c, cannot be the reason of observation of oscillations effect. Thus, no instrumental systematic errors were observed. The distances of detector movements are multiples of section size (23cm). All movements are controlled with laser distance measurer. The measurements were carried out at 10 detector positions in the way that the same distance from the reactor is measured with various detector rows. Spectra measured with various rows at same distance are averaged afterwards. Average distribution of prompt signal counts obtained in background measurements during the whole period of reactor stop is shown in Fig. 17 (top). It was mentioned before that cosmic background of fast neutrons in lab room is inhomogeneous due to the building structure. It appears as a slope of background dependence on L/E in Fig. 16a, and as the profile of that distribution (red line in Fig. 17 top). Therefore, to estimate how the detector inhomogeneity can affect the results, one should consider the deviation of counts from that profile, as shown in Fig. 17 (bottom). We should remind that first and last rows are not used for obtaining the final dependence on L/E and mean value of the deviation is ~ 8%.",

Fig.26 illustrates sensitivity of other experiments NEOS [12], DANSS [16], STEREO [17] and PROSPECT [18] together with Neutrino-4. For experiments on nuclear power plants sensitivity to identification of effect of oscillations with big \u2206m 14 2 is considerably suppressed because of the big sizes of an active zone. Experiment Neutrino-4 has some advantages in sensitivity to big values of \u2206m 14 2 owing to a compact reactor core, close minimal detector distance from the reactor and wide range of detector movements. Next highest sensitivity to large values of \u2206m 14 2 belongs to PROSPECT experiment. Currently its sensitivity is two times lower than Neutrino-4 sensitivity, but it recently has started data collection, so it possibly can confirm or refute our result. The BEST experiment started in August 2019 in BNO has good sensitivity at \u2206m 14 2 > 5eV 2 area [19]. There is combined analysis of Neutrino-4 result and BEST potential in case of gallium anomaly confirmation in this experiment [20].",
