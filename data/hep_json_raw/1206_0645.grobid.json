Muon tracks are reconstructed with energies as low as 20 GeV. Neutrino oscillations will cause a suppression of vertical upgoing muon neutrinos of such energies crossing the Earth. The parameters determining the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos are extracted by fitting the event rate as a function of the ratio of the estimated neutrino energy and reconstructed flight path through the Earth. Measurement contours of the oscillation parameters in a two-flavour approximation are derived. Assuming maximal mixing, a mass difference of \u2206m 2 32 = (3.1 \u00b1 0.9) \u2022 10 \u22123 eV 2 is obtained, in good agreement with the world average value.",

The effect was discovered by Super-Kamiokande [1] on neutrinos produced in the Earth atmosphere. In this paper, the first observation of neutrino oscillations by a high energy neutrino telescope is presented. As this measurement addresses a higher neutrino energy range, the analysis presented here is complementary to previous measurements. In particular, the selection procedure for \u03bd \u00b5 events, on which the oscillation parameters are measured, is different with respect to a similar analysis at lower energies. Whereas the separation of \u03bd \u00b5 charged current events from \u03bd e and neutral current events becomes much easier, handling the background from misreconstructed downgoing muons is more challenging (see Section 6).",

The telescope is optimised for the detection of Cherenkov light induced by the passage of upgoing muons produced in charged current interactions of neutrinos at TeV energies, for which the muon can traverse completely the equipped detector volume. At lower neutrino energies, both the cross section and the muon range are smaller resulting in a decrease of the detection efficiency. For the analysis presented here, the lowest energies of detectable muons from neutrino interactions are about 20 GeV. For upgoing atmospheric neutrinos which traverse the Earth, this threshold is low enough for the observed flux of \u03bd \u00b5 induced events to be significantly suppressed by neutrino oscillations. By studying the observed upgoing muon rate as a function of the ratio of the reconstructed muon energy and zenith angle, constraints on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters are derived.",

The method combines a strict selection of direct Cherenkov photon hits which are grouped around \"hot spots\" at each detector line with a \u03c7 2 -like fitting procedure. A hot spot corresponds to a signal of at least 4 photoelectrons seen on two adjacent storeys of the same detector line within a narrow time window of less than 100 ns. Only hits on detector lines with such a hot spot are used in the track fitting. If the selected hits occur only on one detector line, a single-line fit is performed. No azimuth angle is determined in this case due to the rotational symmetry of the problem. This does not affect the present measurement, as the oscillation probability does not depend on the azimuth angle (see Equation 3). If selected hits occur instead on several detector lines, a multi-line fit is performed which provides both the zenith and azimuth angles of the track. The inclusion of single-line events is a special feature of the reconstruction method and allows to significantly lower the energy threshold of the final atmospheric neutrino sample. Whereas for multi-line events the threshold energy of the final neutrino sample is about 50 GeV due to the 65 m horizontal gap between lines, single-line events are reconstructed down to 20 GeV for nearly vertical tracks, accessing events with E \u03bd /L values close to the first oscillation maximum.",

Atmospheric muons are often seen as bundles and they can be accompanied by hard stochastic processes such as bremsstrahlung. Both effects complicate their correct reconstruction and a certain fraction of downgoing atmospheric muon events are misreconstructed as upgoing. Some cuts on the quality of the reconstructed tracks are needed to reduce this contamination and derive reliably neutrino oscillation parameters from the data set. The goodness of the track fit is measured by the \"normalised fit quality\" as introduced in [16], a quantity equivalent to a \u03c7 2 per number of degrees of freedom (NDF).

The average quantum efficiency of the phototubes was changed by \u00b110% as well as their angular acceptance. The water absorption length of sea water was also varied by \u00b110%. Further, the cuts in the normalised fit quality were varied in two steps of 0.05 around the chosen values thereby testing the stability of the analysis procedure. The spectral index of the atmospheric neutrino flux was varied by \u00b10.03 as suggested in [19]. As a result a set of values of R was derived. It was observed that R remains stable within 5% of its original value, R 0 . This value \u03c3 R = 0.05 is used in Equation 7 to constrain relative variations of \u01eb and \u03b7. This accounts for the maximal variation of the shape of the E R / cos \u0398 R distribution due to the considered systematic effects.",

If maximal mixing is assumed, a value \u2206m 2 32 = (3.1 \u00b1 0.9) \u2022 10 \u22123 eV 2 is obtained. The result agrees well with current world data and demonstrates a good understanding of the performance of the ANTARES telescope at its lowest accessible energies. It is the first such measurement by a high energy neutrino telescope and underlines the potential of future low energy extensions of the existing neutrino telescopes for such physics.",
