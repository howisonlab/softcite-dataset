The search uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Decays of the excited electron into an electron and a pair of quarks (eqq) are targeted in final states with two electrons and two hadronic jets, and decays via a gauge interaction into a neutrino and a W boson (\u03bdW ) are probed in final states with an electron, missing transverse momentum, and a large-radius jet consistent with a hadronically decaying W boson. No significant excess is observed over the expected backgrounds. Upper limits are calculated for the pp \u2192 ee * \u2192 eeqq and pp \u2192 ee * \u2192 e\u03bdW production cross sections as a function of the excited electron mass m e * at 95% confidence level. The limits are translated into lower bounds on the compositeness scale parameter of the model as a function of m e * . For m e * < 0.5 TeV, the lower bound for is 11 TeV. In the special case of m e * = , the values of m e * < 4.8 TeV are excluded. The presented limits on are more stringent than those obtained in previous searches.",

This analysis uses the model presented in Ref. [6] as a benchmark. The composite models introduce new constituent particles called preons that bind at a high scale to form SM fermions and their excited states. The preon bound states are mapped into representations of the SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) SM gauge group. The SM fermions are identified as a set of left-and righthanded chiral states protected by the SU (2) symmetry from obtaining masses of the order of [6]. The remaining vectorlike states, SU (2) doublets and singlets, acquire masses of the order of and are thus interpreted as excited fermions. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch",

            "text": "Here, f = , q and f * = * , q * denote SM and excited leptons and quarks, and the subscripts L and R stand for left-and right-handed components of the fermion field f , respectively. The j \u03bc term is the fermion current of f and f * . The W \u03bc\u03bd and B \u03bc\u03bd are the field-strength tensors of the SU (2) and U (1) gauge fields, and g and g are the corresponding coupling constants of the electroweak theory. The left-and right-handed excited fermions are both SU (2) doublets, with the weak hypercharge Y such that f * electric charges coincide with the ones of their ground states f . The weak hypercharge Y of the * L,R doublet is \u22121, so that its isospin T 3 = \u22121/2 component represents an excited lepton with electric charge Q = \u22121. Therefore, the excited lepton model introduces two unknown parameters relevant for this analysis, the excited lepton mass m e * and the compositeness scale , which define the preferred search channels and kinematic properties of the final states. The four-fermion CI terms are suppressed by 1/ 2 implying the parton-level e * production cross section growing proportionally to\u015d. The considered models allow only left-handed currents in the contact-interaction terms, and all dimensionless couplings defining the relative strength of the residual interactions are set to unity [6]. The restriction m e * < follows from unitarity constraints on the contact interactions [6,7]. Branching ratios (B) for excited electrons as functions of m e * for the case of = 10 TeVare presented in Fig. 1. Gauge-mediated decays dominate at m e * while the decay via a contact interaction becomes dominant for m e * /3. This article presents a search for excited electrons singly produced in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV via a contact interaction qq \u2192 ee * and decaying either to an electron and a pair of quarks (eqq) via a contact interaction or to a neutrino and a W boson (\u03bdW ) via a gauge interaction, depicted in Fig. 2a, b, respectively. Given the sensitivity of the search, the contribution of gauge-mediated production of the excited electrons is non-negligible relative to the contact-interaction production only for m e * < 200 GeV [8] and thus neglected. The search uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment [9] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",

The first channel targets the production of excited electrons via a contact interaction qq \u2192 ee * and their decay via a contact interaction e * \u2192 eqq, resulting in two energetic electrons and at least two hadronic jets j. In the second channel, the excited electrons are produced via a contact interaction as well, but their decay is via a gauge-mediated interaction into a W and a \u03bd, where the W boson decays hadronically, yielding an ee * \u2192 e\u03bdqq final state. Experimentally, this gives final states with exactly one energetic electron, a largeradius (large-R) jet J produced by two collimated quarks, and missing transverse momentum. The large-R jet approach is sufficient for the current analysis, as the analysis selection with two resolved jets has minor efficiency. In the following, the final states resulting from contact-and gauge-mediated decays of singly produced e * are denoted by eej j and e\u03bd J , respectively. The combination of the two channels maximizes the sensitivity of the search for all m e * / values. For possible reinterpretations, the results are also presented in terms of model-independent upper limits on the number of signal events and on the visible signal cross section.",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector [9] is a multipurpose detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly 4\u03c0 coverage in solid angle. 1 The three major subcomponents of ATLAS are the tracking detector, the calorimeter, and the muon spectrometer. Charged-particle tracks and vertices are reconstructed by the inner detector (ID) tracking system, comprising silicon pixel (including the newly installed innermost pixel layer [27,28]) and silicon microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, and a strawtube tracker that covers |\u03b7| < 2.0. The ID is immersed in a homogeneous 2 T magnetic field provided by a solenoid. The energies of electrons, photons, and jets are measured with sampling calorimeters. The ATLAS calorimeter system covers a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is performed with barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid argon (LAr) calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is performed with a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr endcap calorimeters. The forward region (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) is instrumented with a LAr calorimeter with copper and tungsten absorbers for EM and hadronic energy measurements, respectively. Surrounding the calorimeters is a muon spectrometer (MS) with superconducting air-core toroidal magnets. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The MS includes three stations of precision tracking chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.7 to measure the curvature of tracks. The MS also contains detectors with triggering capabilities covering |\u03b7| < 2.4 to provide fast muon identification and momentum measurements.",

            "text": "The statistical analysis of the search is based on a maximumlikelihood fit. The signal hypothesis test is performed using a likelihood-ratio test statistic in the asymptotic approach [75]. The likelihood function is constructed as the product of Poisson probabilities of the SR and the CRs as in Ref. [83]. The normalizations of the backgrounds which have CRs, i.e., Z /\u03b3 * + jets and tt for the eej j channel and W + jets and tt for the e\u03bd J channel, are free parameters, denoted by \u03b2, in the fit. These corrections are used to scale the background predictions in the SRs. Their values and uncertainties after the background-only fit in the CRs are summarized in Table 8. The deviation of the \u03b2 values from unity reflects the fact that at high S T the simulated events do not accurately describe the data. This is also observed, for example, in the leptoquark search by ATLAS [84]. After the fit in the corresponding CR, the background yields agree with the data in all VRs within the uncertainties. The final fit combining CRs and SRs results in negligible shifts of the background normalization factors with respect to the CR-only fits. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated into the likelihood function with a set of nuisance parameters with Gaussian constraint terms. Statistical uncertainties from the simulated event samples are included as nuisance parameters with Poisson constraint terms. Correlations of the systematic uncertainty effects across regions are taken into account. The signal normalization (strength) is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function for each Single-top 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 1.9 \u00b1 0.5 2.6 \u00b1 0.6 3.0 \u00b1 1.4 3.0 \u00b1 1.4 4\u00b1 2 1 .9 \u00b1 0.7 1.9 \u00b1 0.6 1.7 \u00b1 0.7 The statistical analysis is performed using the RooStats [85] and HistFitter [86] software. The observed and expected yields in the SRs for the eej j and e\u03bd J channels after the combined maximum-likelihood fits to only background processes in the CRs and SRs are shown in Tables 9 and 10, respectively. When calculating the uncertainties on the expected yields in the SRs, all correlations between the nuisance parameters estimates are taken into account. No significant excess above the expected SM background is observed, and limits on the excited lepton model parameters are set at 95% confidence level (CL), using the CL s method [87]. The upper limits on the signal production cross section times branching ratio \u03c3 \u00d7 B as a function of m e * are presented in Fig. 5a, b for the eej j and e\u03bd J channels, respectively. The fluctuations observed in the limit for the e\u03bd J channel for m e * points below 1 TeV are caused by the selection criteria optimized separately at each mass points.",

The sensitivity of the search is significantly better than the previous results obtained by ATLAS and CMS from LHC Run 1.
