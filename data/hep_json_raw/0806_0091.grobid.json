The parton fractional momenta probed at such energies can be as low as x \u2248 2pT / \u221a s e \u2212y \u2248 10 \u22125 at large rapidities y, opening up attractive opportunities for low-x QCD studies. The combination of the CMS HF (3< |\u03b7| <5) and CASTOR (5.1< |\u03b7| <6.6) calorimeters allows one, in particular, to reconstruct very forward jets. We present generator-level studies of the CMS capabilities to measure the single inclusive forward jet spectrum and forward-backward (Mueller-Navelet) dijets in p-p collisions at 14 TeV. Both observables are sensitive to low-x gluon densities and non-linear QCD evolution.",

            "text": "The parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton have been studied in detail in deepinelastic-scattering (DIS) ep collisions at HERA [1]. For decreasing parton momentum fraction x = p parton /p hadron , the gluon density is observed to grow rapidly as xg(x, Q 2 ) \u221d x \u2212\u03bb(Q 2 ) , with \u03bb \u2248 0.1-0.3 rising logarithmically with Q 2 . As long as the densities are not too high, this growth is described by the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) [2] or by the Balitski-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) [3] evolution equations which govern, respectively, parton radiation in Q 2 and x. Eventually, at high enough centre-of-mass energies (i.e. at very small x) the gluon density will be so large that non-linear (gluon-gluon fusion) effects will become important, saturating the growth of the parton densities [4]. Studies of the high-energy (low-x) limit of QCD have attracted much theoretical interest in the last 10-15 years, in the context of DIS and of nucleus-nucleus collisions [5]. Experimentally, direct information on the parton structure and evolution can be obtained in hadron-hadron collisions from the perturbative production of e.g. jets or prompt \u03b3's, which are directly coupled to the parton-parton scattering vertex. From leading-order (LO) kinematics, the rapidities and momentum fractions of the two colliding partons are related via",

The Monte Carlo samples used in this analysis were part of the official CMS QCD-jets simulation using PYTHIA [19] in seven 1M-eventsp T bins across the E T = 15-230 GeV range. Events are selected where at least one jet above 20 GeV falls in the forward HF acceptance. The matching radius between generated and reconstructed jets, for reconstruction performance studies, is set at \u2206R = 0.2. The E T resolutions for the three different algorithms are very similar: \u223c18% at E T \u223c20 GeV decreasing to \u223c12% for E T 100 GeV (Fig. 3, left). The position (\u03b7, \u03c6) resolutions (not shown here) for jets in HF are also very good: \u03c3 \u03c6,\u03b7 = 0.045 at E T = 20 GeV, improving to \u03c3 \u03c6,\u03b7 \u223c 0.02 above 100 GeV. The forward jet energy scale uncertainty is, however, expected to be relatively large (in the range 10%-3% in the same E T range) [16]. Figure 3 right shows the single jet spectrum expected in both HFs for 1 pb \u22121 integrated luminosity obtained at the parton-level from pythia for two different PDF sets (CTEQ5L and MRST03) compared to a NLO calculation (CTEQ6M, R = 0.5, scales \u00b5 = 0.5E T -2E T ) [20]. The single jet spectra obtained for different PDFs are similar at high E T , while differences as large as O(60%) appear below \u223c60 GeV. The measurement of low-E T forward jets in HF seems in principle feasible: the statistical errors are negligible and the HF energy resolution is very good (Fig. 3, left). Yet, in the \"interesting\" low-E T range, the main experimental issue will be the control of the jet-energy scale whose uncertainty propagates into up to \u00b140% differences in the final jet yield. Use of this measurement to constrain the proton PDFs in the low-x range will thus require careful studies of the HF jet calibration.",

The left plot in Fig. 4 shows the expected dijet yields passing the MN kinematics cuts as a function of Q for the pseudo-rapidity separation \u2206\u03b7 \u2248 8. The obtained MN dijet statistics appears large enough to carry out detailed studies of the \u2206\u03b7 dependence, that would e.g. provide evidence for a possible Mueller-Navelet \"geometric scaling\" behaviour [12]. An enhanced azimuthal decorrelation for increasing rapidity separation between the Mueller-Navelet jets is the classical \"smoking-gun\" of BFKL radiation [8,9,10]. The generator-level \u2206\u03c6 jet distributions are plotted in the right plot of Fig. 4 for \u2206\u03b7 = 7.5, 8.5 and 9.5. The peak at \u2206\u03c6 = (\u03c6 1 \u2212 \u03c6 2 ) \u2212 \u03c0 = 0 indicates that the two jets are highly correlated with each other. As the \u2206\u03b7 between the two jets increases, the peaks diminish and the distributions get increasingly larger, signaling a loss in correlation. Since pythia is a leading-order generator without any BFKL (or saturation) effect, the observed azimuthal decorrelation is just due to parton shower effects and initial-or final-state radiation. Such a result provides, thus, a baseline of the minimal decorrelation expected in non-BFKL scenarios. Detailed simulation studies are ongoing to test the sensitivity of such forward jet measurements to signal (or not) the presence of \"genuine\" low-x decorrelations. ",
