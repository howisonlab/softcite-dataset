Additional detectors for event classification and trigger purposes exist such that the range -4.0 < \u03b7 < 5.0 is covered. The event topologies of single and double gap events can be identified by requiring the existence of charged tracks in the central barrel with absence of activity on one or both sides of the central barrel, respectively.",
