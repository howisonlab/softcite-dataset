In a picture of early hadronisation, pairs of particles and anti-particles (created at the same space-time point) are separated further in rapidity due to the higher initial temperature and diffusive interactions with other particles. Therefore delayed hadronisation will lead to strong correlations in rapidity in the final state. In this work, balance functions for identified charged-pion pairs measured by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are presented. These balance functions are presented in relative rapidity (\u2206y) and relative azimuthal angle (\u2206\u03d5). It is observed that the charged-pion balance function widths in \u2206y and \u2206\u03d5 get narrower in central Pb-Pb collisions compared to peripheral collisions. The findings in this analysis are consistent with the effects of delayed hadronisation and radial flow. * Speaker.",

The balance function (BF) is sensitive to the effects of electric charge conservation amongst produced particles in high energy collisions [1,2,3]. When measuring the BF as a function of relative rapidity/pseudorapidity (y,\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03d5), it is shown that a late stage hadronisation is characterised by tightly correlated charge-anticharge pairs [4]. Early stage hadronisation is expected to result in a broad BF, while late stage hadronisation leads to a narrower distribution. The BF is constructed by the normalised net correlation between oppositely charged particles and is defined as [4,5] ",

Here, N a,b counts pairs of opposite charges satisfying a criterion that their relative rapidity/pseudorapidity or \u03d5 is within a specified range, whereas N a , N b are the number of positive or negative particles in the chosen phase space. Here the angular brackets represent averaging over the events. The BF is measured by combining two types of particles called trigger and associated particles with transverse momenta p T,trig and p T,assoc . The single terms were constructed in two different ways, the associated yield per trigger particle [6,7] and the number correlation function R 2 [8]. In this analysis a pseudorapidity range (\u03b7) between -0.8 and 0.8 and p T,trig and p T,assoc range between 0.2 and 1.4 GeV/c was used. First, a two-dimensional correlation function is generated in (\u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03d5) which is then projected on \u2206\u03d5 and \u2206\u03b7 for further studies. The BF correlation follows a characteristic structure with a peak at the near side (\u2206\u03b7 = 0 , \u2206\u03d5 = 0). By studying BFs involving different hadronic species, and calculating the width of the BF, one can obtain insight the chemical evolution of the QGP. The BF widths are also sensitive to amount of radial flow in heavy-ion collisions [1].",

Only events with a reconstructed vertex and with z position of the vertex |V z | < 10 cm were analysed. The events were divided in centrality classes, spanning 0-80% of the total inelastic cross section. The most central events were analyzed in 5% bins (0-5% and 5-10%) and the more peripheral in 10% bins. The centrality of an event was estimated by using the multiplicity distribution of signals from the V0 detectors. Primary particle tracks are reconstructed, selected [7] and identified [9] using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-Of-Flight detector (TOF). Here, the n \u03c3 method is used to identify particles with n \u03c3 < 3. The TPC is used for identification of particles with p T of 0.2 to 0.6 GeV/c. The combination of TPC and TOF information is used for identification of particles with p T of 0.6 to 1.4 GeV/c.",

It is calculated using the RMS value or the weighted average of the BF distributions projected in \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03d5. The results for identified charged pion pairs are shown in Fig. 2. The correlation functions have a dip near \u2206y = 0 and \u2206\u03d5 = 0. This dip might be the combined effect of Bose-Einstein correlations and Coulomb interactions between charged pions. The widths of the balance functions for the three centrality classes are shown in Fig. 3. A significant narrowing of the BF width of pions with increasing centrality is observed. The broadening of the balance functions for less central collisions is a result of a larger separation of balancing charges. This centrality dependence is consistent with two scenarios: delayed hadronisation and increasing radial flow.    ",
