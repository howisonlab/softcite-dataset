The latter comprised a cylindrical Time Projection Chamber (TPC) around the target and an array of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) that surrounded the TPC. The purpose of the TPC was track reconstruction and particle identification by dE/dx. The purpose of the RPCs was to complement the particle identification by time of flight. This is the eighth of a series of cross-section papers with results from the HARP experiment. In the first paper [2] we described the detector characteristics and our analysis algorithms, on the example of +8.9 GeV/c and \u22128.0 GeV/c beams impinging on a 5% \u03bb int Be target. The second paper [3] presented results for all beam momenta from this Be target. The third [4], fourth [5], fifth [6], sixth [7], and seventh [8] papers presented results from the interactions with 5% \u03bb int tantalum, copper, lead, carbon, and tin targets. In this paper, we report on the large-angle production (polar angle \u03b8 in the range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 125 \u2022 ) of secondary protons and charged pions, and of deuterons, in the interactions with a 5% \u03bb int aluminium target of protons and pions with beam momenta of \u00b13.0, \u00b15.0, \u00b18.0, +12.9, \u221212.0, and \u00b115.0 GeV/c.",

Since our track reconstruction algorithm is optimized for tracks with p T above \u223c70 MeV/c in the TPC volume, we do not give cross-sections from tracks with p T below this value. Because of the absorption of slow protons in the material between the vertex and the TPC gas, and in order to keep the correction for absorption losses below 30%, cross-sections from protons are limited to p > 450 MeV/c at the interaction vertex. Proton cross-sections are also not given if a 10% error on the proton energy loss in materials between the interaction vertex and the TPC volume leads to a momentum change larger than 2%. Pion cross-sections are not given if pions are separated from protons by less than twice the time-of-flight resolution.",

The latter cross-sections are plotted as published, while we expressed our cross-sections in the units used by the HARP Collaboration. The errors shown are the published total errors. The discrepancy between our results and those published by the HARP Collaboration is evident. It shows the same pattern as observed in inclusive cross-sections off other target nuclei [2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. We hold that the discrepancy is caused by problems in the HARP Collaboration's data analysis, discussed in detail in Refs. [18][19][20][21][22], and summarized in the Appendix of Ref. [2]. nuclei. 1 The comparison is performed for three reference beam momenta (\u00b13, \u00b18 and \u00b112 GeV/c) and employs the scaling variable A 2/3 where A is the atomic mass number of the respective nucleus. We note the approximately linear dependence on this scaling variable. At low beam momentum, the slope exhibits a strong dependence on beam particle type, which tends to disappear with higher beam momentum. Linearity with A 2/3 implies that inclusive pion production scales with the geometrical cross-section of the nucleus. We note that at the lowest beam momenta the inclusive pion cross-section tends to fall below a linear dependence on A 2/3 , while at the highest beam momenta the cross-sections Fig. 1 Inclusive cross-sections of the production of secondary protons, \u03c0 + 's, and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by protons on aluminium nuclei, in the polar-angle range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 30 \u2022 , for different proton beam momenta, as a function of the charge-signed p T of the secondaries; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 2 Inclusive cross-sections of the production of secondary protons, \u03c0 + 's, and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by \u03c0 + 's on aluminium nuclei, in the polar-angle range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 30 \u2022 , for different \u03c0 + beam momenta, as a function of the charge-signed p T of the secondaries; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 3 Inclusive cross-sections of the production of secondary protons, \u03c0 + 's, and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by \u03c0 \u2212 's on aluminium nuclei, in the polar-angle range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 30 \u2022 , for different \u03c0 \u2212 beam momenta, as a function of the charge-signed p T of the secondaries; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 4 Inclusive Lorentz-invariant cross-sections of the production of protons, \u03c0 + 's and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by incoming protons between 3 GeV/c and 15 GeV/c momentum, in the rapidity range 0.6 < y < 0.8, as a function of the charge-signed reduced transverse particle mass, m T \u2212 m 0 , where m 0 is the rest mass of the respective particle; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 5 Inclusive Lorentz-invariant cross-sections of the production of protons, \u03c0 + 's and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by incoming \u03c0 + 's between 3 GeV/c and 15 GeV/c momentum, in the rapidity range 0.6 < y < 0.8, as a function of the charge-signed reduced transverse pion mass, m T \u2212 m 0 , where m 0 is the rest mass of the respective particle; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 6 Inclusive Lorentz-invariant cross-sections of the production of protons, \u03c0 + 's and \u03c0 \u2212 's, by incoming \u03c0 \u2212 's between 3 GeV/c and 15 GeV/c momentum, in the rapidity range 0.6 < y < 0.8, as a function of the charge-signed reduced transverse pion mass, m T \u2212 m 0 , where m 0 is the rest mass of the respective particle; the shown errors are total errors Fig. 7 Inclusive cross-sections of the production of secondary \u03c0 + 's and \u03c0 \u2212 's, integrated over the momentum range 0.2 < p < 1.0 GeV/c and the polar-angle range 30 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 90 \u2022 , from the interactions on aluminium nuclei of protons (top row), \u03c0 + 's (middle row), and \u03c0 \u2212 's (bottom row), as a function of the beam momentum; the shown errors are total errors and mostly smaller than the symbol size tend to lie above a linear dependence. We conjecture that this behaviour arises from the production of tertiary pions from the interactions of secondaries in nuclear matter. At high beam momenta, the acceptance cut of p > 0.2 GeV/c has a minor effect on the tertiary pions. The transition of the inclusive pion cross-section from an approximate A 2/3 dependence for light nuclei towards an approximate A dependence for heavy nuclei (owing to the increasing contribution of pions from the re-interactions in nuclear matter) becomes apparent. At low beam momenta, the acceptance cut of p > 0.2 GeV/c suppresses a large fraction of the primarily low-momentum tertiaries, thus not only hiding this transition but even reversing its trend. Figure 11 compares the 'forward multiplicity' of secondary \u03c0 + 's and \u03c0 \u2212 's in the interaction of protons and pions with beryllium, carbon, aluminium, copper, tin, tantalum, and lead target nuclei. The forward multiplicities are averaged over the momentum range 0.2 < p < 1.0 GeV/c and the polar-angle range 30 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 90 \u2022 . They have been obtained by dividing the measured inclusive cross-section by the total cross-section inferred from the nuclear interaction lengths and pion interaction lengths, respectively, as published by the Particle Data Group [23] and reported in Table 1. The errors of the forward multiplicities are dominated by a 3% systematic uncertainty.",

We observe further that the general preponderance of \u03c0 + over \u03c0 \u2212 decreases with increasing atomic mass number A. For +8.0 GeV/c beam momentum, the trend even reverses from light to heavy nuclei. We interpret this feature as follows. The heavier the target nucleus, the larger the neutron-to-proton ratio. While low-energy secondary protons produce in their re-interactions in nuclear matter considerably more \u03c0 + than \u03c0 \u2212 , the situation is the opposite for low-energy secondary neutrons as shown long ago in a pertinent experiment [24]. The heavier the target nucleus, the larger the neutron-to-proton ratio and therefore the contribution to \u03c0 \u2212 production by secondary neutrons.",

We note the approximately linear dependence on this scaling variable. At low beam momentum, the slope exhibits a strong dependence on beam particle type, which tends to disappear with higher beam momentum.Linearity with A 2/3 implies that inclusive pion production scales with the geometrical cross-section of the nucleus. We note that at the lowest beam momenta the inclusive pion cross-section tends to fall below a linear dependence on A 2/3 , while at the highest beam momenta the cross-sections",
