In fall 2010 and fall 2011, ATLAS has collected 7 \u00b5b \u22121 and 0.14 nb \u22121 , respectively, of lead-lead (Pb+Pb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV used for physics analyses. In fall 2012 a pilot proton-lead (pPb) run was realized delivering approximately 1 \u00b5b \u22121 of collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. The full pPb run at the same center of mass energy followed in the winter 2013 delivering approximately 28 nb \u22121 . Some of the measurements done with Pb+Pb collisions use as a reference proton-proton (pp) collisions delivered at the same center-of-mass energy, that is \u221a s = 2.76 TeV which were provided by the LHC in the year 2013. These pp collisions together with pp collisions at 7 or 8 TeV are used also to construct a reference at 5.02 TeV which is used in some of the pPb measurements. The results from pPb collisions are summarized in Sec. 2, the results from Pb+Pb collisions are summarized in Sec. 3.",

            "text": "Prior to the first LHC runs of pPb collisions, the main motivation for running these collisions was to improve the understanding of the initial state effects of nuclear collisions, namely to quantify the modifications of parton distribution functions in the nuclear environment. The studies done with pPb data were primarily intended to be a reference for studies of processes in Pb+Pb collisions, where a deconfined matter is produced. However, the pPb collisions have brought several unexpected observations, such as the double-ridge structure in long range pseudorapidity correlations, significant centrality and rapidity dependence of the inclusive jet production, and an enhancement of charged particle yields. In this section we summarize the recent studies in pPb collisions provided by ATLAS starting from measurements of jet yields, going through measurements of correlations between soft and hard processes, Z boson, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2) production, jet fragmentation, and closing by studies of the azimuthal correlations in pPb collisions.",

Indeed, a good correspondence of the jet spectra measured inclusively in centrality with the pQCD prediction employing the EPS09 parameterization of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) [3] was seen, which confirms that the jet suppression seen in Pb+Pb collisions is due to final state effects. The nuclear modification factor of inclusive jets, R pPb , exhibits only little (if any) deviation from unity. On the contrary, the ratios of inclusive jet spectra from different centrality selections show a strong modification of jet production at all p T at forward rapidities and for large p T at midrapidity, which manifests as a suppression of the jet yield in central events and an enhancement in peripheral events. These effects imply that the factorization between hard and soft processes is violated at an unexpected level in proton-nucleus collisions. Furthermore, the modifications at forward rapidities were found to be a function of the total jet energy only, implying that the violations might have a simple dependence on the hard parton-parton kinematics.",

In that study, the underlying event was characterized through measurements of the average sum of the transverse energy at large negative pseudorapidity, \u03a3E T , which were reported as a function of hard scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering was characterized by the average transverse momentum, p avg T , and pseudorapidity, \u03b7 avg , of the two highest transverse momentum jets in the event. It was found that the \u03a3E T is anticorrelated with the dijet p avg T , decreasing by 25% as p avg T varies from 50 to 500 GeV. This general trend is reproduced by leading-order Monte Carlo (MC) generators. These anticorrelations measured in pp collisions provide a useful context for understanding the pPb results, since they indicate a nontrivial correlation between hard scattering kinematics and \u03a3E T production.",

This was done separately in the projectile and target beam-protons defined as moving to positive and negative rapidity, respectively. Transverse energy production at large negative pseudorapidity was observed to be linearly dependent on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton, x targ , and only weakly with that in the projectile proton, x proj . This shows that the average level of transverse energy production is sensitive predominantly to the Bjorken-x of the parton originating in the beam-proton which is headed towards the energy-measuring region (x targ ), and is mostly insensitive to x in the other proton (x proj ). These results provide counterevidence to claims that the observed centrality-dependence of the jet rate in pPb collisions simply arises from the suppression of transverse energy production at negative rapidity in the hardscattered nucleon-nucleon sub-collision (being e.g. a consequence of an energy loss conservation [5]). In the pPb data, the deviations from the expected centrality dependence are observed to depend only on, and increase with, x in the proton, that is with x proj . Therefore, for this effect to be consistent with arising from a feature of nucleon-nucleon collisions, transverse energy production at small angles should decrease strongly and continuously with increasing x proj .",

An important component of the measurement is the centrality bias correction [7] which should reduce the correlation between hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event activity. After applying the centrality bias correction the N coll scaled yield of Z bosons is approximately centrality independent, consistent with a production mechanism that scales with the number of binary collisions -though this scaling is less good for Glauber-Gribov Colour Fluctuation model [8,9] than for the simple Glauber model. The Z boson production cross section measured as a function of rapidity and x Pb is systematically larger compared to predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations even after including effects from modifications of nPDF as predicted by EPS09.",

The jet yields were measured over the kinematic range of jet transverse momentum 32 < p T < 500 GeV, and absolute rapidity |y| < 2.1. The jet R AA was found to reach a value of approximately 0.5, implying that the jet yields are suppressed by a factor of two in central collisions compared to pp collisions. The R AA shows a slight increase with p T and no significant variation with rapidity. This later observation is in particular striking given the large differences in slopes of jet spectra and differences in the jet flavor at different rapidities. Also striking is relatively sizable modification seen in 60-80% peripheral collisions with the R AA \u2248 0.8 for jets with p T < 100 GeV.",

            "text": "A high-precision measurements of jet R AA is only possible with a good understanding of the detector response, in particular the jet energy scale (JES) which was elaborated in Ref. [26]. The JES was constructed by calibrating the heavy ion (HI) jets with respect to the standard pp jets using the analysis of pp collision data. The JES for the latter is well understood through a combination of in situ techniques in which the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a Z boson or \u03b3 was measured. To establish a JES calibration for the HI jets, pp data at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 were analyzed and both pp and HI jets were reconstructed. The pp jets were then used as a reference to cross calibrate the HI jets. Applying the HI JES in data from different run periods requires to further consider the effects of different detector operating conditions as well as the fact that the flavor fractions are expected to change with beam energy. An uncertainty on the absolute JES was then derived for HI jets resulting from the \"baseline\" uncertainty on the reference jets, additional uncertainties in the cross calibration procedure itself and the flavor composition and response uncertainties of HI jets. Finally, differences in the response to quenched jets were evaluated and a systematic uncertainty which accounts for such differences was derived using the PYQUEN [27] sample. The PYQUEN generator was setup to run in two different configurations chosen to match the modifications of fragmentation functions measured in the data. The total JES uncertainty in central Pb+Pb collisions was found to be largest at low p T , approximately 4% at 30 GeV, and decreasing with p T to values between 2-3% at 450 GeV. A complementary measurement to the jet R AA is the R AA of charged particles [28]. In that analysis, the charged particle spectra were measured over a wide transverse momentum range, 0.5 < p T < 150 GeV, and in eight bins in pseudorapidity covering the range of |\u03b7| < 2. The charged particle R AA 's show a distinct p T dependence with a pronounced minimum at about 7 GeV. Above 60 GeV, R AA is consistent with a plateau at a centrality-dependent value which is approximately 0.55 for the 0-5% most central collisions. The R AA distribution is consistent with flat pseudorapidity dependence over the whole transverse momentum range in all centrality classes.",

Thus, our understanding of the jet quenching should strongly profit from the direct measurement of jet fragmentation published by ATLAS in Ref. [29]. In that measurement, it was found that the central-to-peripheral ratios of fragmentation functions of jets with p T > 100 GeV show a reduction of fragment yield in central collisions relative to peripheral collisions at intermediate z values, 0.04 < z < 0.2 and an enhancement in fragment yield for z < 0.04. A smaller, less significant enhancement was observed at large z in central collisions. Similar observations were done also for the distributions of transverse momenta of charged particles reconstructed inside jets. From the analysis of measured distributions it was concluded for the 0-10% most central collisions that the increase in the number of particles with 0.02 < z < 0.04 is less than one particle per jet. A decrease of about 1.5 particles per jet was observed for 0.04 < z < 0.2. Further it was concluded that in the 0-10% most central collisions a small fraction, <2%, of the jet transverse momentum is carried by the excess particles in 0.02 < z < 0.04 for central collisions, but that the depletion in fragment yield in 0.04 < z < 0.2 accounts on average for about 14% of jet p T . These observations should directly help to improve understanding of modifications of parton showers in the medium.",

The variation of the jet yield with \u2206\u03c6 was characterized by the parameter, v jet 2 , and the ratio of out-of-plane (\u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0/2) to in-plane (\u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0) yields.

The dijet asymmetry, A J , was studied as a function of angle between the leading-jet and the elliptic event-plane. These measurements effectively study the path-length dependence of A J by requiring the jet pair to traverse different lengths of the medium. The dependence of the A J on the event-plane angle was quantified by calculating the second Fourier coefficient of the A J azimuthal distribution, termed c 2 . The measured c 2 signal is quite small (\u22642%), however, it is consistently negative, indicating a slightly larger asymmetry when the dijet pair is oriented outof-plane than in-plane. This measurement was further extended by repeating the analysis when constraining the shape of the collision geometry by selecting events based on the magnitude of the second-order flow harmonic quantified by the magnitude of the q 2 vector. Within a given centrality interval, events with large q 2 , i.e. events with a more elliptic geometry, show an increase in the c 2 for the 20-30% and 30-40% centrality bins. In other centrality intervals, the statistical precision of the results, obtained with additional binning in q 2 , is insufficient to conclude the observation of any systematic dependence of A J on the event-plane angle.",

The measured neighbouring jet pairs result primarily from hard radiation by the parton that occurs early in the process of the shower formation. Generally, two neighbouring jets originating from the same hard scattering should have more similar path lengths in the medium compared to the two jets in the previous dijet measurement. Therefore measuring neighbouring jets could probe differences in their quenching that do not result primarily from difference in path length as well as put some constraints to models in which a part of the parton shower radiates coherently in the response to the medium. The production of pairs of correlated jets was quantified using the rate of neighbouring jets that accompany a test jet, R \u2206R . This observable was used in past by D\u2205 collaboration to measure the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 s , and to test its running over a large range of momentum transfers [33]. The R \u2206R was evaluated both as a function of test-jet E T and neighbouringjet E T . A significant dependence of R \u2206R on collision centrality was observed in both cases, suggesting a suppression of neighbouring jets which increases with increasing centrality of the collision. The centrality dependence of the suppression was further quantified using the centralto-peripheral ratio of R \u2206R distributions, \u03c1 R \u2206R . The trends seen in \u03c1 R \u2206R evaluated as a function of neighbouring-jet E T indicate a decrease in suppression with increasing neighbouring-jet E T . The \u03c1 R \u2206R evaluated as a function of test-jet E T exhibits a suppression reaching values of 0.5-0.7 in 0-10% central collisions and does not show any strong dependence on E T .",

At high transverse momenta this anisotropy is understood to result from the path-length dependent energy loss of jets as they traverse the deconfined matter as discussed in previous paragraphs. At low transverse momenta (p T 3 \u2212 4 GeV), this anisotropy results from a pressure driven anisotropic expansion of the created matter, with more particles emitted in the direction of the largest pressure gradient. In Pb+Pb collisions, ATLAS has performed event-averaged measurement of elliptic flow and higher order flow harmonics [34,35,36,37], the event-by-event flow measurements [38] and the measurement of event plane correlations [39]. Recently, ATLAS has performed also the measurement of correlations between different flow harmonics in Pb+Pb collisions [40]. In that measurement, it was found that v 3 is anticorrelated with v 2 and this anticorrelation is consistent with similar anticorrelations between the corresponding eccentricities \u01eb 2 and \u01eb 3 . On the other hand, it was observed that v 4 increases strongly with v 2 , and v 5 increases strongly with both v 2 and v 3 . The trend and strength of the v m \u2212v n correlations for n = 4 and 5 were found to disagree with m \u2212 n correlations predicted by initial-geometry models.

Two particle pseudorapidity correlations can probe e.g. the rapidity profile of the initial-state fireball. This ATLAS measurement was done in the pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2.4 with charged particles having p T > 0.5 GeV. The measured two particle correlation functions show a broad \"ridge-like\" shape along \u03b7 1 = \u03b7 2 and a depletion at around \u03b7 1 = \u2212\u03b7 2 .

Further, the measured two particle correlation functions were expanded in terms of products of Legendre polynomials, T n (\u03b7 1 )T m (\u03b7 2 ), and corresponding coefficients, a n,m , were extracted. The first term, a 2 n , is connected with the asymmetry between forward and backward particle production which was confirmed to be large as seen previously in other measurements. The second term reflects the even-by-event fluctuation of the width of charged particle multiplicities, N (\u03b7). Significant mixed coefficients a n , a m are also observed. The most significant group of mixed coefficients a n , a n+2 is found to be negative, implying that a n and a n+2 are generally anticorrelated. The magnitudes of a n , a n+2 , were found to decrease quickly for larger n. These extracted coefficients are generally found to increase for peripheral collisions, which is consistent with the increase of the multiplicity fluctuation for smaller collision systems.",
