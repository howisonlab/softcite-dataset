In addition, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton can be better constrained [1]. The production of EW bosons has therefore been an important benchmark process to measure at current and past colliders. Measurements performed by the ATLAS [2][3][4], CMS [5][6][7], and LHCb [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] collaborations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions that are determined from parton-parton cross-sections convolved with PDFs. The precision of these predictions is limited by the accuracy of the PDFs and JHEP10(2016)030 by unknown QCD corrections which are beyond next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD [15,16].",

Since the Bjorken-x values of the interacting partons, x a and x b , are related to the boson through its rapidity, y = 1 2 ln xa x b , forward measurements of production cross-sections are particularly valuable in constraining PDFs. The LHCb detector, which is instrumented in the forward region, is in a unique situation to provide input on determining accurate PDFs at small and large Bjorken-x values. At large rapidities the measurements are mainly sensitive to scattering between valence and sea quarks, while at low rapidities scattering between pairs of sea quarks also contributes significantly. The W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratio and the production charge asymmetry of the W boson are primarily sensitive to the ratio of u-and d-quark densities. In addition, the cross-section ratio and charge asymmetry enable the SM to be tested to greater precision since experimental and theoretical uncertainties partially cancel.",

Compared to muons, the measurement of electrons has an additional experimental difficulty arising from the bremsstrahlung emitted when traversing the detector material. While the emitted photon energy can often be recovered for low-energy particles, electrons from W boson decays tend to have high momentum, with bremsstrahlung photons that are not generally well-separated from the lepton. Coupled with the fact that individual LHCb calorimeter cells saturate by design at a transverse energy of approximately 10 GeV, this leads to a poor energy measurement and a reconstructed distribution of transverse momentum, p e T , which differs significantly from the true transverse momentum of the electrons. In contrast, the electron direction is measured well, so that the differential cross-section in lepton pseudorapidity has negligible bin-to-bin migrations.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors (PRS), an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. A set of global event cuts (GEC) is applied, which prevents events with high occupancy dominating the processing time of the software trigger. Simulated data are used to optimise the event selection, estimate the background contamination and determine some efficiencies. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 8 [19,20] with a specific LHCb configuration [21]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [22,23] as described in ref. [24]. The momentum distribution of the partons inside the proton is parameterised by the leading-order CTEQ6L1 [25] PDF set. Final-state radiation (FSR) of the outgoing leptons is simulated using the model implemented internally within Pythia 8 [26].",

A simulation-based estimate for EW contamination is subtracted and a 50% systematic uncertainty is assigned for the procedure. Components that are constrained in the fits are varied according to their respective uncertainties. Templates for Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 eX are subject to an uncertainty on the cross-section, and the normalisation of the rare processes has an uncertainty from the cross-sections and the luminosity determination. Two alternative control regions are considered for determining the fake electron component resulting in an uncertainty of 0.6% on the total cross-section. The fits are repeated with these alternative regions to ascertain the uncertainty associated with the fake electron template. The systematic uncertainty on the normalisation of the heavy flavour component is 0.8% and the data-driven p T template is varied accordingly. The transverse momentum of the candidate in simulation is sensitive to both the potential mismodelling of track reconstruction and the description of the material traversed by the candidate. The latter affects the number of bremsstrahlung photons emitted and thus has an impact on the p e T of the candidate and, by extension, on the fits. Any potential mismodelling can be described by a scaling of the momentum, as explained in ref. [12]. The effect of varying the momentum scale on all simulation-based templates is tested on the inclusive fit shown in figure 1 and the best fit value for the momentum scale is seen to be consistent with unity, suggesting that material in the detector is modelled well. An uncertainty of 0.5% assigned on the momentum scale in ref. [12] is found to be appropriate for the measurement. Varying the momentum scale by its uncertainty in the fits binned in \u03b7 e leads to an uncertainty of 1.3% on the total cross-section which is the largest contribution to \"Yield (systematic)\".",
