The studied Bs decays are contained in the 121.4 fb \u22121 \u03a5(5S) data sample collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. The branching fractions of the decays are measured to be B(Bs \u2192 D \u2212 s X + \u03bd) = [8.2 \u00b1 0.2(stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst) \u00b1 1.4(ext)]% and B(Bs \u2192 D * \u2212 s X + \u03bd) = [5.4 \u00b1 0.4(stat) \u00b1 0.4(syst) \u00b1 0.9(ext)]%, where the first two uncertainties are statistical and systematic and the last is due to external parameters.

            "text": "Analyses of semileptonic decays B \u2192 X c \u03bd, where X c denotes a hadronic final state with a charm quark, play an important role in the determination of the CKM matrix element |V cb |. The extraction of |V cb | from the measured decay rates relies on form factors that describe the accompanying strong interaction processes. Measurements of semileptonic B s decays provide complementary information to test and validate the QCD calculations of these form factors. Since large B s samples have become available at Belle and the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, the interest in the topic of semileptonic B s decays has intensified recently. Theoretical predictions of form factors and branching fractions are based on QCD sum rules [1][2][3][4], lattice QCD [5,6] and constituent quark models [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. The predicted exclusive branching fractions vary from 1.0% to 3.2% for B s \u2192 D s \u03bd decays and from 4.3% to 7.6% for B s \u2192 D * s \u03bd decays. There are also predictions for the modes with higher excitations of the D s meson, denoted hereinafter by \"D * * s \". The LHCb and D\u00d8 experiments have measured the semi-inclusive branching fractions of the decays B s \u2192 D s1 (2536)X\u00b5 + \u03bd and B s \u2192 D * s2 (2573)X\u00b5 + \u03bd, where the D * * s mesons were reconstructed in D ( * ) K final states [16,17]. The inclusive semileptonic branching fraction of B s \u2192 X \u03bd decays was recently measured by Belle and BaBar [18,19] and found to be in agreement with the expectations from SU(3) flavor symmetry [20,21]. We report here the first measurements of the semi-inclusive branching fractions B(B s \u2192 D s X \u03bd) and B(B s \u2192 D * s X \u03bd) using the Belle \u03a5(5S) dataset. The number of B ",

Herein, we focus on the tails of the signal peaks because they can be easily assigned in the fit to the background component without deteriorating the agreement of the data with the fitted curve. The signal PDF in the D s fits is modified by replacing the second Gaussian function by a bifurcated Gaussian function. This choice is motivated by a small asymmetry of the signal peak due to final state radiation. The normalization and the widths of the bifurcated Gaussian function are determined relative to the normalization and width of the Gaussian function from a fit to signal MC. These parameters are fixed in the fit to data. Based on the observed change of the signal yield, we assign a 3% PDF uncertainty. In the D * s fits, the tails of the signal peak are described by the Gaussian component of the signal PDF. When this Gaussian function is removed from the signal PDF, i.e. a Crystal Ball function only is used (cf. Ref. [43]), the signal yields decrease by 5%. Hence, we estimate the PDF uncertainty with 5%.",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The semi-inclusive semileptonic B s branching fractions are calculated from Eq. (3). Since the D s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + reconstruction mode is also used in the determination of N BsBs [23], the B(D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) branching fraction cancels out. Using the branching fraction ratio B(D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + )/B(D s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (41.6 \u00b1 0.8)% and the branching fraction B(D * s \u2192 D s \u03b3) = (94.2 \u00b1 0.7)% [31], we obtain the semi-inclusive branching fractions: D s Xe\u03bd : [8.1 \u00b1 0.3(stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst) \u00b1 1.4(ext)]% , D s X\u00b5\u03bd : [8.3 \u00b1 0.3(stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst) \u00b1 1.5(ext)]% , D * s Xe\u03bd : [5.2 \u00b1 0.6(stat) \u00b1 0.4(syst) \u00b1 0.9(ext)]% , D * s X\u00b5\u03bd : [5.7 \u00b1 0.6(stat) \u00b1 0.4(syst) \u00b1 1.0(ext)]% . The first uncertainty is the statistical uncertainty of the data and MC samples, the second is the systematic uncertainty of the measurement, and the last uncertainty is due to the external measurements of N BsBs and B D ( * ) s . The electron and muon samples are statistically independent because only one candidate is selected per event. Taking into account that the systematic uncertainties are all correlated except the one for lepton identification, we calculate the combination of the measurements as weighted averages: D s X \u03bd : [8.2 \u00b1 0.2(stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst) \u00b1 1.4(ext)]% , D * s X \u03bd : [5.4 \u00b1 0.4(stat) \u00b1 0.4(syst) \u00b1 0.9(ext)]% .",

The result of our measurement is in agreement with the estimate,B est (B s \u2192 D s X \u03bd). The rate of B s \u2192 D * * s \u03bd; D * * s \u2192 D * s X decayscan be constrained from the comparison between the measured semi-inclusive branching fraction, B(B s \u2192 D * s X \u03bd) with the exclusive theory predictions for B(B s \u2192 D * s \u03bd).
