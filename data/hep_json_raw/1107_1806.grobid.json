Fitting to \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum yields a mass M = 1877.3 \u00b1 6.3(stat.) +3.4 \u22127.4 (syst.) MeV/c 2 , a width \u0393 = 57 \u00b1 12(stat.) +19 \u22124 (syst.) MeV/c 2 , and a product branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9X) \u2022 B(X \u2192 a \u00b1 0 (980)\u03c0 \u2213 ) \u2022 B(a \u00b1 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = [1.50 \u00b1 0.26(stat.) +0.72 \u22120.36 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Signals for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f1(1285) and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1405) are also clearly observed and measured. The resonance known as the X(1835), was first observed in the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by BESII [1] and subsequently confirmed with a much higher signal significance by BESIII [2]. Several theoretical speculations have been proposed to interpret the nature of X(1835), including the pp bound state [3][4][5] that was first observed near the same mass in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp at BESII [6] and confirmed by BESIII and CLEO [7], a second radial excitation of the \u03b7 \u2032 [8], and a pseudo-scalar glueball [9][10][11]. In the lower mass region of the \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, around 1.4 GeV/c 2 , extensive studies [12][13][14] have established the existence of the \u03b7(1405), which has also been suggested as a candidate for a pseudo-scalar glueball [15]. Experimentally, the study of the production mechanism of the X(1835) and \u03b7(1405), e.g. searches for them in \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states with other accompanying particles (\u03c9, \u03c6, etc.), are useful for clarifying their nature. In particular, the measurements of the production widths of these two states in hadronic decays of the J/\u03c8 and a comparison with corresponding measurements in J/\u03c8 radiative decays would provide important information about the glueball possibility [16].",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) that are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field.

The acceptance of charged particles and photons is 93% of 4\u03c0 steradians, and the charged-particle momentum and photon energy resolutions at 1 GeV are 0.5% and 2.5%, respectively.

We also studied an inclusive MC sample of 2 \u00d7 10 8 J/\u03c8 decays generated according to the Particle Data Group (PDG) decay table and Lund-charm model [22]. No backgroundinduced peaks are observed around 1.87 GeV/c 2 . The inclusive MC sample is also used for the validation of the background estimation method described above, which is able to well reproduce the input background components. Figure 4 shows the results of a fit to the \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum where either \u03b7\u03c0 + or \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 are in the a 0 (980) mass window. Here the three signal peaks are parametrized by Breit-Wigner functions convolved with a Gaussian resolution function and multiplied by an efficiency curve, which are both determined from signal MC samples and fixed in the fit. The background consists of three components, namely contributions from non-\u03c9 and/or non-a 0 (980) processes, J/\u03c8 \u2192 b 1 (1235)a 0 (980) events, and non-resonant \u03c9a 0 (980)\u03c0 processes. The background shapes and numbers of events for the non\u03c9 and/or non-a 0 (980) processes are determined from the events in the two-dimensional side bands as discussed above, and fixed in the fit. For the J/\u03c8 \u2192 b 1 (1235)a 0 (980) component of background, the background shape is fixed to that of the phase space MC samples whereas the number of events is extracted and fixed to the result of a two dimensional fit to the \u03c9\u03c0 versus \u03b7\u03c0 mass distributions. The contribution of the remaining non-resonant \u03c9a 0 (980)\u03c0 process is described by a smooth floating polynomial function. The mass, width, and the product branching fractions obtained from the fit are summarized in Table I. For the f 1 (1285) and \u03b7(1405), the measured mass and width are in agreement with PDG values [23]. The statistical significance of the X(1870) signal is determined by the change of the log likelihood value and the degree of freedom in the fits with and without the assumption of an X(1870). With all factors in the fit varied, the smallest change in the \u22122 ln L is 60.1, corresponding to a significance of 7.2\u03c3. The same procedure is applied to the f 1 (1285) and \u03b7(1405) signals, and the significances are determined to be much higher than 10\u03c3.",

We also include  I: Summary of measurements of the mass, width and the product branching fraction of B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9X) \u00d7 B(X \u2192 a \u00b1 0 (980)\u03c0 \u2213 ) \u00d7 B(a \u00b1 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u00b1 ) where X represents f1(1285), \u03b7(1405) and X(1870). Here the first errors are statistical and the second ones are systematic. 1.25 \u00b1 0. the systematic errors determined from the input/output checks based on the analysis of fully reconstructed MC samples, in which the input parameters are set according to the final results and the background is represented by the background channels seen in the inclusive MC sample. For systematic errors originating from the potential structure around 2.2 GeV/c 2 and the multipleevent candidate selection, we re-fit the mass spectrum of \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the inclusion of an X(2120) resonance as recently reported by BESIII [2] in the decay channel of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and all the valid multiple-entry candidates kept in order to estimate the uncertainty due to these two sources, respectively. With the numbers from all the sources above combined quadratically, the systematic errors on the mass and width parameters are determined as shown in Table I. The systematic errors on the branching fraction measurements are also subject to errors of the number of J/\u03c8 events [17], the intermediate branching fractions [23], the data-MC difference in the \u03c0 tracking efficiency, the photon detection efficiency, the kinematic fit, the signalselection efficiency of \u03b7/\u03c0 0 , the simulation of the line shape of a 0 (980) [24], and the angular distributions due to different possible spin-parity hypotheses. Combined in quadrature with the influence from the mass spectrum fitting, the systematic errors on the product branching fraction for the f 1 (1285), \u03b7(1405) and X(1870) are summarized in Table I. In summary, we present a study of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay channel and report the first observation of the process J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9X(1870) in which X(1870) decays to a \u00b1 0 (980)\u03c0 \u2213 , with the signal significance estimated to be 7.2\u03c3. In the lower mass region of \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, the f 1 (1285) and \u03b7(1405) are also clearly observed with statistical significances much larger than 10\u03c3. The measurements of the mass, width, and product branching fraction of B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9X) \u00d7 B(X \u2192 a \u00b1 0 (980)\u03c0 \u2213 ) \u00d7 B(a \u00b1 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u00b1 ) for the three resonant structures are summarized in Table I, wherein the product branching fractions for the f 1 (1285) and \u03b7(1405) are measured for the first time. Whether the resonant structure of X(1870) is due to the X(1835), the \u03b7 2 (1870), an interference of both, or a new resonance still needs further study such as a partial wave analysis that will be possible with the larger J/\u03c8 data sample that is anticipated in future runs of the BESIII experiment. For the \u03b7(1405), the product branching fraction for its production in the hadronic decay of J/\u03c8 is measured to be smaller than that for its production in the radiative J/\u03c8 decays [23].",
