In the limit of Uspin symmetry, the direct component is equal and opposite in sign for K \u2212 K + and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + [1]. In the Standard Model, CP violation is expected to be small [2,3,1]. However, in the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model the rate of CP violation could be enhanced [1,4].

LHCb has previously reported preliminary results based on 37 pb \u22121 of data collected in 2010 [8]. In the limit that the efficiency for selected events is independent of the decay time, the difference between the two time-integrated asymmetries, \u2206A CP \u2261 A CP (K \u2212 K + ) \u2212 A CP (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ), is equal to the difference in the direct CP asymmetry. However, if the dependence of the efficiency on the decay time is different for the K \u2212 K + and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final states, a contribution from indirect CP violation remains. The Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) has combined time-integrated and time-dependent measurements of CP asymmetries taking account of the different decay time acceptance to obtain world-average values for the indirect CP asymmetry of a ind CP = (\u22120.03 \u00b1 0.23)% and the difference in direct CP asymmetry between the final states of \u2206a dir CP = (\u22120.42 \u00b1 0.27)% [9]. In these proceedings, LHCb results [10,11] for the measurement of the difference in integrated CP asymmetries between D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , performed with approximately 0.6 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2011, are presented.

Potential biases due to the inclusive hardware trigger selection are investigated with the subsample of data in which one of the signal final-state tracks is directly responsible for the hardware trigger decision. In all cases good stability is observed.  Systematic uncertainties are assigned by loosening the fiducial requirement on the soft pion; by assessing the effect of potential effect peaking background in toy Monte Carlo studies; by repeating the analysis with the asymmetry extracted through sideband subtraction instead of a fit; with all candidates but one (chosen at random) removed in events with multiple candidates; and comparing with the result obtained with no kinematic binning. In each case the full value of the change in result is taken as the systematic uncertainty. These uncertainties are listed in Table 1. The sum in quadrature is 0.11%.",

Combining the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature, the significance of the measured deviation from zero is 3.5\u03c3. The result is consistent with the current HFAG world average [9]. Subsequent to this result being presented, several papers on the theoretical interpretation have been written, examining the possible size and uncertainty in the SM contribution and considering possible new physics contributions. A partial list may be found in Ref. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. We thank our theory colleagues for their help in understanding this result.",
