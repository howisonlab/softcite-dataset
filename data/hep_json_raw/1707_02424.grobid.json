In many of them, E 6 is first broken to SO(10) \u00d7 U(1) \u03c8 , with SO(10) then breaking either to SU(4) \u00d7 SU(2) L \u00d7 SU(2) R or SU(5) \u00d7 U(1) \u03c7 . In the first of these two possibilities, a Z 0 3R coming from SU(2) R , where 3R stands for the right-handed third component of weak isospin, or a Z 0 B\u2212L from the breaking of SU (4) into SU(3) C \u00d7 U(1) B\u2212L could exist at the TeV scale, where B (L) is the baryon (lepton) number and (B \u2212 L) is the conserved quantum number. Both of these Z 0 bosons appear in the Minimal Z 0 models discussed in the next section. In the SU (5) case, the presence of U(1) \u03c8 and U(1) \u03c7 symmetries implies the existence of associated gauge bosons Z 0 \u03c8 and Z 0 \u03c7 that can mix. When SU(5) is broken down to the SM, one of the U(1) can remain unbroken down to intermediate energy scales. Therefore, the precise model is governed by a mixing angle \u03b8 E 6 , with the new potentially observable Z 0 boson defined by Z 0 (\u03b8 E 6 ) = Z 0 \u03c8 cos \u03b8 E 6 + Z 0 \u03c7 sin \u03b8 E 6 . The value of \u03b8 E 6 specifies the Z 0 boson's coupling strength to SM fermions as well as its intrinsic width. In comparison to the benchmark Z 0 SSM , which has a width of approximately 3% of its mass, the E 6 models predict narrower Z 0 signals. The Z 0 \u03c8 considered here has a width of 0.5% of its mass, and the Z 0 \u03c7 has a width of 1.2% of its mass [11,12]. All other Z 0 signals in this model, including Z 0 S , Z 0 I , Z 0 \u03b7 , and Z 0 N , are defined by specific values of \u03b8 E 6 ranging from 0 to \u03c0, and have widths between those of the Z 0 \u03c8 and Z 0 \u03c7 .",

To simplify further, the additional parameters \u03b3 0 and \u03b8 Min are chosen as independent parameters with the following definitions:g BL = \u03b3 0 cos \u03b8 Min ,g Y = \u03b3 0 sin \u03b8 Min . The \u03b3 0 parameter measures the strength of the Z 0 boson coupling relative to that of the SM Z boson, while \u03b8 Min determines the mixing between the generators of the (B \u2212 L) and weak hypercharge Y gauge groups. Specific values of \u03b3 0 and \u03b8 Min correspond to Z 0 bosons in various models, as is shown in table 1 for the three cases mentioned in this section. For the Minimal Z 0 models, the width depends on \u03b3 0 and \u03b8 Min , and the Z 0 interferes with the SM Z/\u03b3 * process. For example, taking the 3R and B \u2212 L models investigated in this search, the width varies from less than 1% up to 12.8% and 39.5% respectively, for the \u03b3 0 range considered. The branching fraction to leptons is the same as for the other Z 0 models considered in this search. Couplings to hypothetical right-handed neutrinos, the Higgs boson, and to W boson pairs are not considered. Previous limits on the Z 0 mass versus \u03b3 0 were set by the ATLAS experiment. For \u03b3 0 = 0.2, the range of Z 0 mass limits at 95% CL corresponding to \u03b8 Min \u2208 [0, \u03c0] is 1.11 TeV to 2.10 TeV [16].",

The inner detector (ID) covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The total thickness of the EM calorimeter is more than twenty radiation lengths. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large superconducting air-core toroids with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m for most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A dedicated trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses the calorimeter and muon detectors to reduce the accepted rate to below 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz on average [22].",

[41]. The transition region between the central and forward regions of the calorimeters, in the range 1.37 \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 1.52, exhibits poorer energy resolution and is therefore excluded. Electron candidates are required to have transverse energy (E T ) greater than 30 GeV, and a track consistent with the primary vertex both along the beamline and in the transverse plane. The Medium working point of the likelihood discrimination is used to select electron candidates while the Very Loose and Loose working points are used in the data-driven background estimation described in section 6. In addition to the likelihood discriminant, selection criteria based on track quality are applied. The selection efficiency is approximately 96% for electrons with E T between 30 GeV and 500 GeV, and decreases to approximately 95% for electrons with E T = 1.5 TeV. The selection efficiency is evaluated in the data using a tag-and-probe method [42] up to E T of 500 GeV and the uncertainties due to the modelling of the shower shape variables are estimated for electrons with higher E T using MC events, as described in section 7. The electron energy scale and resolution have been calibrated up to E T of 1 TeV using data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV and \u221a s = 13 TeV [43].

The same sources of experimental uncertainty are considered for the DY background and signal treatment. Efficiencies are evaluated using events from the Z \u2192 '' peak and then extrapolated to high energies. The uncertainty in the muon reconstruction efficiency is the largest experimental uncertainty in the dimuon channel. It includes the uncertainty obtained from Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 data studies and a high-p T extrapolation uncertainty corresponding to the decrease in the muon reconstruction and selection efficiency with increasing p T which is predicted by the MC simulation. The effect on the muon reconstruction efficiency was found to be approximately 3% per TeV as a function of muon p T . The uncertainty in the electron identification efficiency extrapolation is based on the differences in the electron shower shapes in the EM calorimeters between data and MC simulation in the Z \u2192 ee peak, which are propagated to the high-E T electron sample. The effect on the electron identification efficiency was found to be 2.0% and is independent of E T for electrons with E T above 150 GeV. For the isolation efficiencies, uncertainties were estimated for 150 < p T < 500 GeV and above 500 GeV separately, using DY candidates in data. The larger isolation uncertainty that is observed for electrons is due to the uncertainty inherent in calorimeter-based isolation for electrons (track-based isolation is also included), compared to the solely track-based only isolation for muons. Mismodelling of the muon momentum resolution due to residual misalignments in the MS can alter the steeply falling background shape at high dilepton mass and can significantly modify the width of the signals line shape. This uncertainty is obtained by studying the muon momentum resolution in dedicated data-taking periods with no magnetic field in the MS [44]. For the dielectron channel, the uncertainty includes a contribution from the multi-jet and W +jets data-driven estimate that is obtained by varying both the overall normalisation and the extrapolation methodology, which is explained in section 6. The systematic uncertainty from pile-up effects is assessed by inducing a variation in the pile-up reweighting of MC events and is included to cover the uncertainty on the ratio of the predicted and measured inelastic cross-section in the fiducial volume defined by M X > 13 GeV, where M X is the mass of the non- For the signal uncertainties the values were computed using a Z 0 \u03c7 signal model with a pole mass of 2 TeV (4 TeV) by comparing yields in the core of the mass peak (within the full width at half maximum) between the distribution varied due to a given uncertainty and the nominal distribution. \"-\" represents cases where the uncertainty is not applicable. nosity is 3.2%.

This second approach is specifically sensitive to narrow Z 0 -like signals, and is thus complementary to the more general BH approach. To perform the LLR search, the Histfactory [56] package is used together with the RooStats [57] and RooFit [58] packages. The p-value for finding a Z 0 \u03c7 signal excess (at a given pole mass), or a variable width generic Z 0 excess (at a given central mass and with a given width), more significant than that observed in the data, is computed analytically, using a test statistic q 0 . The test statistic q 0 is based on the logarithm of the profile likelihood ratio \u03bb(\u00b5). The test statistic is modified for signal masses below 1.5 TeV to also quantify the significance of potential deficits in the data. As in the BH search the SM background model is constructed using the modes of marginalised posteriors of the nuisance parameters from the MCMC method, and these nuisance parameters are not included in the likelihood at this stage. Therefore, in the search-phase the background estimate and signal shapes are fixed to their post-marginalisation estimates, and systematic uncertainties are not included in the computation of the p-value. Starting with M Z 0 = 150 GeV, multiple mass hypotheses are tested in pole-mass steps corresponding to the histogram bin width to compute the local p-values -i.e. p-values corresponding to specific signal mass hypotheses. Simulated experiments (for M Z 0 > 1.5 TeV) and asymptotic relations (for M Z 0 < 1.5 TeV) in ref.

The Z 0 \u03c7 signal is used to extract the limits, which is over-conservative for the other E 6 models presented, but slightly underconservative for the Z 0 SSM , although only by 100 GeV in the mass limit at most. The upper limits on \u03c3B for Z 0 bosons start to weaken above a pole mass of \u223c 3.5 TeV. The effect is more pronounced in the dimuon channel due to worse mass resolution than in the dielectron channel. The weakening is mainly due to the combined effect of a rapidly falling signal cross-section as the kinematic limit is approached, with an increasing proportion of the signal being produced off-shell in the low-mass tail, and the natural width of the resonance. The selection efficiency also starts to slowly decrease at very high pole masses, but this is a subdominant effect.",

This was achieved by applying fiducial cuts to the signal (lepton p T > 30 GeV, and lepton |\u03b7| < 2.5) and a mass window of two times the true signal width (width of the Breit-Wigner) around the pole mass of the signal. This is expected to give limits that are more model independent since any effect on the sensitivity due to the tails of the resonance, foremost the parton luminosity tail and interference effects, are removed. The resulting limits can be seen in figure 6. For other models to be interpreted with these cross-section limits, the acceptance for a given model in the same fiducial region should be calculated, multiplied by the total cross-section, and the resulting acceptance-corrected cross-section theory curve overlaid, to extract the mass limit for that model. The dilepton invariant mass shape, and angular distributions for the chosen model, should be sufficiently close to a generic Z 0 resonance, such as those presented in this article, so as not to induce additional efficiency differences.",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector at the LHC has been used to search for both resonant and nonresonant new phenomena in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum above the Z boson's pole. The search is conducted with 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded during 2015 and 2016. The highest invariant mass event is found at 2.90 TeV in the dielectron channel, and 1.99 TeV in the dimuon channel. The observed dilepton invariant mass spectrum is consistent with the Standard Model prediction, within systematic and statistical uncertainties. Among a choice of different models, the data are interpreted in terms of resonant spin-1 Z 0 gauge boson production and non-resonant qq'' contact interactions. For the resonant interpretation, upper limits are set on the cross-section times branching ratio for a spin-1 Z 0 gauge boson. The resulting 95% CL lower mass limits are 4.5 TeV for the Z 0 SSM , 4.1 TeV for the Z 0 \u03c7 , and 3.8 TeV for the Z 0 \u03c8 . Other E 6 Z 0 models are also constrained in the range between those quoted for the Z 0 \u03c7 and Z 0 \u03c8 . This result is more stringent than the previous ATLAS result at \u221a s = 13 TeV obtained with 2015 data, by up to 700 GeV. Lower mass limits are also set on the Minimal Z 0 model, up to 4.1 TeV for the Z 0 3R , and 4.2 TeV for the Z 0 B\u2212L . Generic Z 0 cross-section limits are also provided for a range of true signal widths. The lower limits on the energy scale \u039b for various qq'' contact interaction models range between 24 TeV and 40 TeV, which are more stringent than the previous ATLAS result obtained at \u221a s = 13 TeV, by up to 4 TeV.

The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 p (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .",
