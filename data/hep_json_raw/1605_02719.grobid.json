            "text": "At the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton (pp) collider, Drell-Yan lepton pairs are produced in the process pp \u2192 e + e \u2212 +X through an intermediate \u03b3 * /Z boson. The forward-backward asymmetry in the polar-angle distribution of the e \u2212 as a function of the e + e \u2212 -pair mass is used to obtain sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff , the effective leptonic determination of the electroweak-mixing parameter sin 2 \u03b8W . The measurement sample, recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), corresponds to 9.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions at a center-of-momentum energy of 1.96 TeV, and is the full CDF Run II data set. The value of sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff is found to be 0.23248 \u00b1 0.00053. The combination with the previous CDF measurement based on \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs yields sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff = 0.23221 \u00b1 0.00046. This result, when interpreted within the specified context of the standard model assuming sin 2 \u03b8W = 1 \u2212 M 2 W /M 2 Z and that the W -and Z-boson masses are on-shell, yields sin 2 \u03b8W = 0.22400 \u00b1 0.00045, or equivalently a W -boson mass of 80.328 \u00b1 0.024 GeV/c 2 .",

This paper presents a new measurement of the sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff coupling and an inference of the sin 2 \u03b8 W parameter using a sample of e + e \u2212 pairs corresponding to an integrated pp luminosity of 9.4 fb \u22121 collected at the Tevatron pp collider.

Its presence induces an asymmetry in the \u03d5-integrated cos \u03d1 dependence of the cross section.

Form factors calculated by zfitter are tabulated for later use in QCD calculations. The specific standardmodel assumptions and parameters used in the formfactor calculation are presented in the appendix, as well as their usage in the scattering amplitude A q . The calculated form factors are \u03c1 eq , \u03ba e , \u03ba q , and \u03ba eq , where the label e denotes an electron and q denotes a quark. As the calculations use the massless-fermion approximation, the form factors only depend on the charge and weak isospin of the fermions. Consequently, the tabulated form factors are distinguished by three labels, e (electron type), u (up-quark type), and d (down-quark type). The form factors are complex valued, and are functions of the sin 2 \u03b8 W parameter and the Mandelstam\u015d variable of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z \u2192 ff process. The \u03c1 eq , \u03ba e , and \u03ba q form factors of the amplitude can be reformulated as corrections to the Born-level g f A and g f V couplings,",

The highest quality of signal selection and background rejection is provided by the trackers in combination with the CES. An electron candidate must have shower clusters within the electromagnetic calorimeter towers and CES signals compatible with the lateral profile of an electromagnetic shower. A candidate must also be associated to a track that extrapolates to the three-dimensional position of the CES shower centroid. The transverse momentum of the particle associated with the track must be consistent with the associated electron shower E T via an E/P selection when P T < 50 GeV/c [27]. For both the track matching in the CES and the E/P selection, allowances are included for bremsstrahlung energy-loss in the tracking volume, which on average is about 20% of a radiation length. The fraction of shower energy in the hadroniccalorimeter towers behind the tower cluster of the electromagnetic calorimeter must be consistent with that for electrons through an E HAD /E EM requirement.

The bias of the observed value, \u2206 cos \u03d1, obtained from the simulation, is defined as the difference between its true value prior to the application of QED FSR and the observed value. The measurement of A fb is in turn biased by the fraction of events for which the sign of the observed cos \u03d1 differs from the true value; this change of sign is denoted by sign-reversed cos \u03d1. The bias distribution consists of a narrow central core of well reconstructed events, and a very broad distribution from events where the electron kinematic properties are poorly reconstructed. Charge misidentification reverses the sign of cos \u03d1. If events with charge misidentification are excluded, the bias distributions of CC-and CP-topology events have narrow non-Gaussian central cores centered at zero with 95% of the events being contained within the range |\u2206 cos \u03d1| < 0.006. For oppositecharge CC-topology events, the effects of detector resolution dominate the bias. The fraction of events with sign-reversed cos \u03d1 is 0.3%, with most of the events being within the range | cos \u03d1| < 0.1. For CP-topology events, the misidentification of the central-electron charge dominates the fraction of events with sign-reversed cos \u03d1. The fraction decreases in value from 0.6% to 0.2% as | cos \u03d1| increases from 0.2 to 0.8. The measurement resolution of cos \u03d1 consists of multiple components but their effects are small. The rapidity distribution of electron pairs for the asymmetry measurement is shown in Fig. 17, along with the shape the underlying rapidity distribution from pythia. At large values of |y|, the detector acceptance is significantly reduced. For increasing values of |y| in the |y| 1 region, the asymmetry slowly changes. This change can only be tracked by event-weighting method if it has the events to do so. Consequently, the measurement of A fb is restricted to the kinematic region |y| < 1.7. QCD calculations of A fb used for comparisons with the measurement are similarly restricted. The electron-pair mass range of the measurement, 50 to 350 GeV/c 2 , corresponds to maximum |y| values of 3.7 to 1.7, respectively.",

In the basis vector space of the error matrix, the \u03c7 2 of each scan point is n (\u03b4A fb ) 2 n /(\u03bb n + r n ), where the index n runs over all the eigenvector numbers and \u03b4A fb is the difference between the measured and calculated values of A fb . The regularization function shown in Fig. 21 is defined and optimized as follows. The shape of the regularization function is chosen so that it selectively suppresses eigenvectors that project onto noise rather than the uncertainties of the measurement. To identify these eigenvectors, the expansion of the error matrix is truncated one eigenvector at a time. Truncating eigenvectors 14 and 13 from the error matrix significantly improves the goodness-offit. There is no further improvement with the truncation of lower numbered eigenvectors. Consequently, the regularization terms for eigenvectors 13 and 14 are set to values significantly larger than the eigenvalues so that the contributions of their constituents to the \u03c7 2 are negligible. The regularization term for eigenvector 12 is set to a value that is comparable with its companion eigenvalue. For eigenvector numbers 11 and under, the regularization terms are set to zero or values much smaller than the eigenvalues so that their components in the \u03c7 2 are unaffected or negligibly affected by the regularization terms. The optimum normalization level is determined via a scan of level scale-factor values, starting from 0. As the scale-factor value increases, the goodness-of-fit rapidly improves then enters a plateau region without significant improvement and only a degradation of the measurement resolution. The optimum is chosen to be slightly beyond the start of the plateau region, where the sin 2 \u03b8 W parameter is also stable in value.",

For graphical compar-  isons of best-fit A fb templates, the difference relative to a reference calculation is used: A fb \u2212 A fb (pythia) where the reference A fb (pythia) is the tuned pythia calculation described in Sec. VI on the signal simulation. Figure 24 shows the difference distributions for the measurement, the powheg-box calculation, and the resbos calculation. The comparison of powheg-box with NNPDF-3.0 PDFs to resbos with CTEQ6.6 PDFs illustrates the nature of A fb (M ) as a simultaneous probe of the electroweak-mixing parameter and the PDFs. The NNPDF-3.0 PDFs include collider data from the LHC The measurement uncertainties considered are from the energy scale and resolution, and from the background estimates. The bias-correction uncertainty from the PDFs, expected to be a small secondary effect, is not included. For the propagation of uncertainties to the extracted value of sin 2 \u03b8 W , the default PDF of the NNPDF-3.0 ensemble is used. The total measurement systematic uncertainty is \u00b10.00003.",

In conjunction, the mass distributions of the simulation have been tuned to agree with those of the data, and the agreement between them, presented in Figs. 12 and 13 is good. Since the energy scales of the data and simulation are calibrated separately from the underlying-physics scale, the potential effect of an offset between the global scales of the simulation and data is investigated as a systematic uncertainty. The electron-pair mass distributions in the vicinity of the Z-boson mass peak are used to constrain shifts. Scale shifts for the central and plug EM calorimeters are considered separately. The resulting uncertainty from the energy scale is \u00b10.00003. The potential effect of the limitations to the energy-resolution model of the simulation is also investigated, and the resulting uncertainty is estimated to be negligible.",

The indirect measurement of sin 2 \u03b8 W from LEP-1 and SLD, 0.22332\u00b10.00039, is from the standard-model fit to all Z-pole measurements [11,12] described in Appendix F TABLE V.

The effective-leptonic parameter sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff is derived from the measurement of the forwardbackward asymmetry A fb (M ) based on the entire CDF Run II sample of electron pairs, reconstructed in 9.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions at a center-ofmomentum energy of 1.96 TeV.

The value of the M W is varied over 80.0-80.5 GeV/c 2 , and for each value, zfitter calculates G F and the form factors.
