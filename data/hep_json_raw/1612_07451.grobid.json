The measurement is performed for J/\u03c8 mesons with a transverse momentum of less than 10 GeV/c in the rapidity range 2.0 < y < 4.5. The production cross-section is measured to be 15.2 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 0.9 nb. The first uncertainty is statistical, and the second is systematic. The differential cross-sections as functions of several kinematic variables of the J/\u03c8 pair are measured and compared to theoretical predictions.",

            "text": "The production mechanism of heavy quarkonia is a long-standing and intriguing problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is not fully understood even after over forty years of study. The colour-singlet model (CSM) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] assumes the intermediate QQ state to be colourless and to have the same J P C quantum numbers as the final quarkonium state. Leading-order calculations in the CSM underestimate the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) production cross-sections at high transverse momentum, p T , by more than one order of magnitude [11]. The gap between CSM predictions and experimental measurements is reduced when including next-to-leading-order corrections, but the agreement is still not satisfactory [12][13][14]. The non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) model takes into account both colour-singlet (CS) and colour-octet (CO) states of the QQ pair [15][16][17]. It either describes the production cross-sections and polarisations at large p T or it describes the production cross-section at all p T values, but then fails to predict the polarisation [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. This puzzle can be probed via the production of pairs of quarkonia [34][35][36][37][38][39], where the interpretation of the measured cross-section could be simpler. In quarkonium-pair production, the selection rules in the CS process of leading-order (LO) NRQCD forbid the feed-down from cascade decays of excited C-even states. This feed-down from C-even states, e.g. \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 or \u03c7 b \u2192 \u03a5 \u03b3, plays an important role in single quarkonium production. It significantly complicates the precise comparison between data and model predictions, and makes the interpretation of polarisation measurements difficult.",

The DPS processes have been studied in several final states, e.g. 4-jets by the AFS [40], UA2 [41], CDF [42], and ATLAS [43] collaborations, \u03b3 + 3-jets by the CDF [44] and D0 [45,46] collaborations, 2\u03b3 + 2-jets by the D0 [47] collaboration, W + 2-jets [48] and \u03a5 + \u03a5 [49] by the CMS collaboration, J/\u03c8 + W [50] and J/\u03c8 + Z [51] by the ATLAS collaboration, and double charm [52], Z + open charm [53] and \u03a5 + open charm [54] by the LHCb collaboration. After having been first observed by the NA3 collaboration in pion-nuclear and proton-nuclear interactions [55,56], J/\u03c8 pair production has been measured in pp collisions by the LHCb [57] and CMS [58] experiments at \u221a s = 7 TeV and by the ATLAS experiment [59] at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

The effective crosssection is related to the transverse overlap function between partons in the proton, and is thought to be universal for all processes and energy scales. Most of the measured values of \u03c3 eff lie in the range 12 \u2212 20 mb [43, 54,64], which supports the expectation that \u03c3 eff is universal for a large range of processes with different kinematics and scales, and for a wide spectrum of centre-of-mass energies in pp and pp collisions.",

The SPS contribution is calculated to be 4.0 \u00b1 1.2 nb [67,68] and 4.6 \u00b1 1.1 nb [39] in the leading-order NRQCD CS approach, and 5.4 +2.7 \u22121.1 nb [39] using complete next-to-leading order NRQCD CS approach. The DPS contribution is estimated to be 3.8 \u00b1 1.3 nb with eq. (1.1) using \u03c3 (J/\u03c8 ) from ref. [69] and \u03c3 eff = 14.5 \u00b1 1.7 +1.7 \u22122.3 mb from ref. [44]. The large number of reconstructed J/\u03c8 pair events in the CMS data [58] allowed for study of J/\u03c8 correlations [70]. The observation of events with a large separation in rapidity of two J/\u03c8 mesons indicates a significant DPS contribution, leading to \u03c3 eff = 8.2 \u00b1 2.2 mb [70], somewhat lower than the majority of other \u03c3 eff measurements. A similarly small value, \u03c3 eff = 6.3 \u00b1 1.9 mb, is obtained by the ATLAS collaboration using a data-driven model-independent approach [59]. A small value of \u03c3 eff = 4.8 \u00b1 2.5 mb is also obtained by the D0 collaboration [60] using the separation of the two J/\u03c8 mesons in pseudorapidity to distinguish SPS and DPS contributions. Together with an even smaller value of \u03c3 eff = 2.2 \u00b1 1.1 mb, determined by the D0 collaboration from the measurement of the simultaneous production of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons [71], and the estimate of \u03c3 eff = 2.2\u22126.6 mb by -2 -",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a siliconstrip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector (TT) located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [74], which consists of a hardware stage (L0), based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The L0 trigger requires two muons",

(5.2) can be interpreted as \u03c3 eff if all J/\u03c8 pairs are produced through the DPS process. The results on J/\u03c8 pair production are compared with a data-driven prediction for the DPS mechanism and several calculations performed within the SPS mechanism. The DPS prediction is calculated via eq. (1.1) using the measured J/\u03c8 production cross-section at \u221a s = 13 TeV [85] and the effective cross-section \u03c3 eff = 14.5 \u00b1 1.7 +1.7 \u22122.3 mb from refs. [44,91]. Theoretical predictions of the production cross-section of J/\u03c8 pairs are summarized in table 2. The contribution from the SPS mechanism is calculated using several approaches: the state-of-art complete NLO colour-singlet (NLO CS) computations [39]; the incomplete (no-loops) next-to-leading-order colour-singlet (NLO * CS) calculations [70,[92][93][94][95][96]; leading-order colour-singlet (LO CS) [92] and colour-octet (LO CO) [95,96] calculations and the approach based on the k T -factorisation method [97][98][99][100][101], with the leading-order colour-singlet matrix element (LO k T ) [102,103]. Even with the leading-order matrix element, the LO k T approach includes a large fraction of higher-order contributions via the evolution of parton densities [102]. Since NLO * CS calculations are divergent at small transverse momentum of the J/\u03c8 pair, two approaches are used: a simple cut-off for p T (J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ) [92] (denoted as NLO * CS ), and a cut on the mass of any light parton pair (NLO * CS ) [70,[93][94][95][96].  Table 2. Summary of the theoretical predictions and the measurement of \u03c3(J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ) for different regions of transverse momentum of the J/\u03c8 pair. For SPS predictions, the first uncertainty accounts for the variation of PDFs and gluon densities, while the second one corresponds to the variation of the factorisation and renormalisation scales. For the LO CO predictions the third uncertainty corresponds to the choice of LDMEs from refs. [25,[113][114][115][116][117][118][119]. For NLO CS predictions [39] the uncertainty corresponds to the variation of the factorisation and renormalization scales. For the DPS prediction the first uncertainty is due to the measured prompt J/\u03c8 production cross-section [85] and the second is due to the uncertainty in \u03c3 eff [44,91].",

[104][105][106][107][108] are used for the LO k T approach, while CT 14 parton distribution functions (PDF) [109] are used for LO CS and NLO * CS calculations, NNPDF 3.0 NLO PDFs with \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.118 [110] are used for LO CO and NLO * CS predictions, and CTEQ6L1 and CTEQ6M PDFs [111,112] are used for NLO CS computations. For LO CO predictions the long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) are taken from refs. [25,[113][114][115][116][117][118][119] and a smearing of transverse momenta of initial gluons, similar to that used in NLO * CS , is applied. The production cross-section of J/\u03c8 pairs is sensitive to the choice of parameters; for example, it varies by a factor between 0.8 and 3 when varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales by a factor of two, or increases if the CTEQ 6L PDF set [120] is used instead of the nominal PDFs. The contribution of LO CO is very sensitive to the choice of the LDME; the absolute cross-section varies from the minimum of 0.11 nb, based on LDME set from ref. [113] to the maximum of 0.70 nb, calculated using LDME set from ref. [116], while most of the predictions cluster around 0.5 nb. The feed-down from \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 X decays is included in the LO k T , LO CO and NLO * CS calculations and not in the LO CS and NLO * CS calculations. Likewise, a tiny contribution from J/\u03c8 \u03c7 c production with subsequent decay \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 [92] is included in the NLO * CS and LO CO results but neglected in the NLO * CS calculations.",

The DPS predictions are obtained using a large number of pseudoexperiments, where two uncorrelated J/\u03c8 mesons are produced according to the measured differential distributions d 2 \u03c3 (J/\u03c8 ) /dp T dy [85] for single prompt J/\u03c8 production, uniformly distributed over  the azimuthal angle \u03c6. For LO CO and NLO * CS models two values of Gaussian smearing of the initial transverse momentum of gluon k T are used, namely k T = 0.5 and 2 GeV/c. The p T (J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ) distribution, shown in figure 2, demonstrates the large dependence of the shape on the choice of the k T parameter. For the NLO * CS approach [70,[93][94][95][96], relatively large smearing of the initial gluon transverse momenta k T = 2 GeV/c is required to eliminate peaking structures in the distribution. The distributions of the variables p T (J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ), |\u2206\u03c6| and A T , predicted by the LO CS model, are trivial, p T (J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ) \u223c 0, |\u2206\u03c6| \u223c \u03c0 and A T \u223c 0, and omitted from the plots. A similar trivial pattern is expected for the LO CO model, but due to the k T -smearing, the actual shape of the distributions strongly depends on the choice of the k T parameter. The NLO * CS model also demonstrates a large dependence on the k T parameter for |\u2206\u03c6| /\u03c0 distribution. Neither the DPS model with the given value of the \u03c3 eff parameter, nor any of the SPS models can describe simultaneously the measured cross-section and the differential shapes. However, the sum of the DPS and SPS contributions can adequately describe both the measured production cross-sections and the differential distributions. To discriminate between the SPS and DPS contributions, the differential distribution for each variable v is -10 -  fitted with the simple two-component model",

            "text": "The J/\u03c8 pair production cross-section with both J/\u03c8 mesons in the region 2.0 < y < 4.5 and p T < 10 GeV/c is measured to be 15.2 \u00b1 1.0 (stat) \u00b1 0.9 (syst) nb, using pp collision data collected by LHCb at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 279 pb \u22121 . The differential production cross-sections as functions of p T (J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ), p T (J/\u03c8 ), m(J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ), y(J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 ), y(J/\u03c8 ), |\u2206\u03c6|, |\u2206y| and A T are compared to theoretical predictions. A fit to the differential cross-sections using simple DPS plus SPS models indicates a significant DPS contribution. The data can be reasonably well described with a sum of DPS and SPS colour-singlet contributions, with no evidence for a large SPS colour-octet contribution. The obtained SPS contribution is overestimated in the NLO * CS [70,[93][94][95][96] and NLO CS [39] approaches and roughly agrees with the NLO * CS [92] and LO k T [102] predictions. Good agreement with the data for the differential cross-sections calculated within the LO k T [102] and NLO * CS [92] approaches indicates that a significant part of high-order contributions can be properly accounted via the evolution of parton densities [102]. Relatively large smearing of initial gluon transverse momenta k T = 2 GeV/c is preferred over k T = 0.5 GeV/c for the NLO * CS approach [70,[93][94][95][96]. An improvement in the precision for SPS predictions is needed for a better discrimination between the different theory approaches. A large DPS contribution results in values of \u03c3 eff that are smaller than the values of \u03c3 eff measured previously by the LHCb collaboration in the processes of multiple associated heavy quark production [52,54], and slightly larger than those measured from central J/\u03c8 pair production at the CMS [58] and ATLAS [59] experiments.",
