            "text": "The main goal of the spectroscopy program at COMPASS is to explore the light-meson spectrum in the mass range below about 2 GeV/c 2 using diffractive dissociation reactions. Our flagship channel is the production of three charged pions in the reaction: \u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + + p recoil , for which COMPASS has acquired the so far world's largest dataset of roughly 50 M exclusive events using an 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam. Based on this dataset, we performed an extensive partial-wave analysis. In order to extract the parameters of the \u03c0 J and a J resonances that appear in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + system, we performed the so far most comprehensive resonance-model fit, using Breit-Wigner parametrizations. This method in combination with the high statistical precision of our data allows us to study ground and excited states. We study the a 4 (2040) resonance in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0G and f 2 (1270)\u03c0F decays. In addition to the ground state resonance a 1 (1260), we have found evidence for the a 1 (1640), which is the first excitations of the a 1 (1260), in our data. We also study the spectrum of \u03c0 2 states by simultaneously describing four J PC = 2 \u2212+ waves using three \u03c0 2 resonances, the \u03c0 2 (1670), the \u03c0 2 (1880), and the \u03c0 2 (2005). Using a novel analysis approach, where the resonance-model fit is performed simultaneously in narrow bins of the squared four-momentum transfer t between the beam pion and the target proton, allows us to study the t dependence of resonant and non-resonant components included in our model. We observe that for most of the partial waves, the non-resonant components show a steeper t spectrum compared to the resonances and that the t spectrum of most of the resonances becomes shallower with increasing resonance mass. We also study the t dependence of the relative phases between resonance components. The pattern we observe is consistent with a common production mechanism of these states. ",

In the high-t region (see figure 5e), the higher-lying peak dominates the intensity spectrum and is mainly described by the \u03c0 2 (2005), while the \u03c0 2 (1670) is visible only as a low-mass shoulder. Figure 6 shows the t spectra of the three \u03c0 2 resonances in the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave. They are in good agreement with the exponential model in equation (2.4). The extracted slope parameters of b = 8.5 +0.9 \u22120.5 (GeV/c) \u22122 for the \u03c0 2 (1670), b = 7.8 +0.5 \u22120.9 (GeV/c) \u22122 for the \u03c0 2 (1880), and b = 6.7 +0.5 \u22121.3 (GeV/c) \u22122 for the \u03c0 2 (2005) lie within the range we typically observe for resonances. We observe a similar pattern as for the ground and excited a 1 states, that the slope parameters decrease for increasing resonance masses. The t spectra of the resonances in the other two 2 \u2212+ partial waves with M = 0 are constrained by equation (2.5) to have the same shapes as the ones in of the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave. However, in the 2 \u2212+ 1 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave, the t dependence of the resonance components is independent from the ones in the M = 0 waves. Figure 7 shows the t spectra of the components in the 2 \u2212+ 1 + f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave. In general, the t spectra of the components in this wave are extracted less reliably because: (i) they are constrained by only one wave, while the M = 0 spectra are constrained by three waves and (ii) the f 2 (1270) \u03c0 S wave with M = 1 is small compared to the one with M = 0. The t spectra for the M = 1 wave are in rough agreement with the exponential model in equation (2.4). In particular, they exhibit a drop in intensity towards small",

As the relative coupling phase of the a 4 (2040) in the \u03c1(770)\u03c0G decay is 0 \u2022 by definition, its coupling phase in the f 2 (1270)\u03c0F decay has to be a constant as both are related by equation (2.5). However, the model allows an arbitrary phase offset between the two decay modes. We estimate this phase offset to be close to 0 \u2022 with small systematic uncertainties. The non-resonant components in the two waves show a slight variation of their coupling phase with t with respect to the a 4 (2040) resonance. This feature is also observed for the non-resonant components in other partial waves.",

The huge amount of information condensed in this fit, in combination with the information from the our novel tresolved analysis approach allows us to study ground as well as excited states. It also allows us to study in detail the t dependence of the intensity and coupling phase of these resonances. We observe that for most partial waves, the t spectra of the non-resonant components fall steeper with t as compared to the resonances. This helps to separate resonant from non-resonant contributions. We also observe that for most of the resonances, the t spectra become shallower with increasing resonance mass. This is consistent with the observation that the slope of the overall t spectrum of the data becomes shallower for higher m 3\u03c0 masses (see ref. [1]). Furthermore, the different t dependences of the ground-state and the excited resonances helps to better separate them. An example is the strong evolution of the intensity spectrum of the 2 \u2212+ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 F wave with t (see figures 5d and 5e). Our approach also allows to study the t dependence of the relative phases of the resonances. The pattern we observe is consistent with a common production mechanism. To reduce the systematic uncertainties and to further clarify the existence of higher excited states, models that are based on the principles of unitarity and analyticity are mandatory, especially in waves where the non-resonant contributions are important. This is the topic of future research.",
