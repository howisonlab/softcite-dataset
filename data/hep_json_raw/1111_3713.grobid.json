            "text": "We present a search for neutrino induced events containing a single, exclusive photon using data from the NOMAD experiment at the CERN SPS where the average energy of the neutrino flux is 25 GeV. The search is motivated by an excess of electron-like events in the 200-475 MeV energy region as reported by the MiniBooNE experiment. In NOMAD, photons are identified via their conversion to e + e \u2212 in an active target embedded in a magnetic field. The background to the single photon signal is dominated by the asymmetric decay of neutral pions produced either in a coherent neutrino-nucleus interaction, or in a neutrino-nucleon neutral current deep inelastic scattering, or in an interaction occurring outside the fiducial volume. All three backgrounds are determined in situ using control data samples prior to opening the 'signal-box'. In the signal region, we observe 155 events with a predicted background of 129.2 \u00b1 8.5 \u00b1 3.3. We interpret this as null evidence for excess of single photon events, and set a limit. Assuming that the hypothetical single photon has a momentum distribution similar to that of a photon from the coherent \u03c0 0 decay, the measurement yields an upper limit on single photon events, < 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 per \u03bd \u03bc charged current event. Narrowing the search to events where the photon is approximately collinear with the incident neutrino, we observe 78 events with a predicted background of 76.6 \u00b1 4.9 \u00b1 1.9 yielding a more stringent upper limit, < 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 per \u03bd \u03bc charged current event.",

            "text": "The MiniBooNE experiment, in the neutrino mode, has reported an excess of 129 \u00b1 43 (Stat \u2295 Syst) electron-like events in the 200-475 MeV energy range [1], a range largely unaffected by the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations at m 2 > 1 eV 2 , which is expected to dominate the 475-1250 MeV range [2]. Assuming that the efficiency of these events is 0.25, similar to that of the \u03bd e -induced electrons, the rate of the excess with respect to \u03bd \u03bc -CC is 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . In the antineutrino mode, initially the MiniBooNE data were consistent with background in the 200-475 MeV range [3]. Recently, with additional antineutrino data, they report a 2\u03c3 excess in this region [4]. MiniBooNE lacks the resolution to determine if the excess is due to e \u2212 , e + , or a photon. In neutrino interactions single photons do not occur: they occur in pairs from the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay. Evidence of events with a single photon and nothing else in neutrino induced neutral current (NC) interaction will signal either new or unconventional physics. This anomaly needs to be checked experimentally. The low-energy MiniBooNE excess has motivated novel hypotheses invoking conventional, to unconventional, to entirely new physics processes. An explanation [5] of the excess attributed to the internal bremsstrahlung associated with muons in \u03bd \u03bcinduced charged current interaction (CC) has been refuted by Mini-BooNE [6]. Harvey, Hill, and Hill [7,8] postulate a new anomalymediated interaction between the \u03bd-induced Z 0 -boson, the photon, and a vector meson, such as \u03c9, coupling strongly to the target nucleus. A similar, single photon process has been envisioned by Jenkins and Goldman [9]. In the anomaly-mediated neutrinophoton (ANP) interaction, \u03bdN \u2192 \u03bdN \u03b3 , where N is the target nucleus or nucleon, the observable is a single \u03b3 , approximately collinear with the incident neutrino direction in the lab frame with a recoiling N which remains intact and largely undetected; the form factor of N is expected to induce the single \u03b3 to be pulled forward. The ANP cross-section is expected to increase with neu-* Corresponding author. E-mail address: sanjib@sc.edu (S.R.

The ANP interaction is akin to the exclusive \u03c0 0 production when the neutrino coherently scatters off a target nucleus (Coh \u03c0 0 ), \u03bd + N \u2192 \u03bd + N + \u03c0 0 , where the only observable is \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 . The phenomenology of ANP developed by Hill in [10], and largely focussed on the low energy neutrino interaction (E \u03bd O(1) GeV), predicts a cross-section sufficiently large to explain the MiniBooNE anomaly. If true, the ANP interaction will also impact astrophysical processes such as neutron star cooling. Hypotheses involving new physics include: decay of a heavy neutrino into a light neutrino and a photon, \u03bd h \u2192 \u03bd + \u03b3 , by Gninenko [11,12]; CP-violation in 3 \u2295 2 model by Maltoni and Schwetz [13], and by Goldman et al. [14]; extra-dimensions in 3 \u2295 1 model by Pas et al. [15]; and models by Giunti and Laveder [16]; Lorentz-violation by Katori et al. [17]; CPT-violation in 3 \u2295 1 model by Barger et al. [18]; new gauge bosons with sterile neutrinos by Nelson and Walsh [19]; and soft-decoherence by Farzan et al. [20]; etc. The NOMAD Collaboration has reported a search of heavy-\u03bd which mixes with \u03bd \u03c4 's produced in the SPS proton-target, and then decays into e \u2212 e + pair in the detector [21]. The search focussed on highly collinear (C = [1 \u2212 cos \u0398 ee ] 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) and high energy (E ee 4 GeV) e \u2212 e + events, where \u0398 ee and E ee are the polar angle and the energy of the converted photon, and resulted in a single event consistent with the estimated background. The present work extends this search with no cut on C.",

The positively charged mesons were focussed by two magnetic horns into a 290 m long evacuated decay pipe. Decays of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , and K 0 L produced the SPS neutrino beam.

The \u03bd-flux in NOMAD is constrained by the \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 production measurements in proton-Be collision by the SPY experiment [23][24][25] and by an earlier measurement conducted by Atherton et al.

The E \u03bd -integrated relative composition of \u03bd \u03bc : \u03bd \u03bc : \u03bd e : \u03bd e CC events, constrained in situ by the measurement of CC-interactions of each of the neutrino species, is 1.00 : 0.025 : 0.015 : 0.0015. Thus, 97.5% of the events are induced by neutrinos with a small antineutrino contamination, similar to that reported by MiniBooNE [2].",

The active target comprised 132 planes of 3 \u00d7 3 m 2 drift chambers (DC) with an average density similar to that of liquid hydrogen (0.1 gm/cm 3 ). On average, the equivalent material in the DC encountered by particles produced in a \u03bd-interaction was about half of a radiation length and a quarter of a hadronic interaction length (\u03bb). The fiducial mass of the NO-MAD DC-target, 2.7 tons, was composed primarily of carbon (64%), oxygen (22%), nitrogen (6%), and hydrogen (5%) yielding an effective atomic number, A = 12.8, similar to carbon. Downstream of the DC, there were nine modules of transition radiation detectors (TRD), followed by a preshower (PRS) and a lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The ensemble of DC, TRD, and PRS/ECAL was placed within a dipole magnet providing a 0.4 T magnetic field orthogonal to the neutrino beam line. Two planes of scintillation counters, T 1 and T 2 , positioned upstream and downstream of the TRD, provided the trigger in combination with an anticoincidence signal, V , from the veto counter upstream and outside the magnet. Downstream of the magnet was a hadron calorimeter, followed by two muon-stations each comprising large area drift chambers and separated by an iron filter. The two stations, placed at 8-and 13-\u03bb's downstream of the ECAL, provided a clean identification of the muons. The schematic of the DC-tracker with a \u03b3 -conversion in the Y-Z view is shown in Fig. 1. The charged tracks in the DC were measured with an approximate momentum",

The normalization of the NC-Resonance (W 2 < 1.96) sample is set at 3.5% of the NC-DIS. The Coh \u03c0 0 interaction is simulated using the Rein-Sehgal (RS) model [30] which agrees well with our measurement [31].

The preselection reduces the NC-DIS and data samples by more than a factor of one hundred. It is noteworthy that only a small fraction of the NC-Resonance pass the selection since most of the photons, coming from \u03c0 0 emitted at large angles, either fail to trigger the apparatus or have energies below 1.5 GeV. Given the paucity of the NC-Resonance events, it has been added to the NC-DIS sample. Finally a negligible fraction of \u03bd \u03bc -CC (< 10 \u22125 ) pass the selection; consequently the CC sample has been ignored in this analysis. The preselection is presented in Table 1.",

The procedure defines the DCA-vertex with coordinates denoted as DCA-X, DCA-Y, and DCA-Z. The DCA-vertex resolution is well understood. Among the 2\u03b3 sample 169 events, out of 550 events (see Table 3), have a DCA vertex of origin upstream of the Z Min providing a calibration for the OBG-1\u03b3 as follows. A different data sample, OBG-data which includes charged tracks, is selected in which the vertex reconstructed using these charged tracks is upstream of the fiducial limit (Z Z Min ). In this sample, the charged tracks are ignored and the events subjected to the 2\u03b3 analysis (see [31]). This OBGdata sample with 2\u03b3 yields 927 events with DCA-Z Z Min and 451 events with DCA-Z > Z Min as shown in Table 3. The number of 2\u03b3 events with DCA-Z > Z Min , originating from events occurring at Z Z Min but producing no visible tracks, is then calculated as (451/927) \u00d7 169 = 82.2 \u00b1 6.1.

The figure evinces agreement between data and the prediction for PAN < 0.9. Furthermore, the observed kinematic variables associated with the neutral cluster in ECAL are found to be consistent with the prediction. The observed momentum distribution of the photon is consistent with the prediction as evidenced by Fig. 3. Lastly, Fig. 4 shows that the measured \u03b6 \u03b3 distribution agrees with the MC prediction.

The logic behind using this control sample to constrain the background in the signal region is that 1\u03b3 events come from \u03c0 0 -dominated neutral current events where one of the photons evades detection. One concern, however, is that of a possible systematic bias when using the PAN < 0.9, a region where both photons are reconstructed in DC and ECAL, i.e. the two photons are emitted in the forward direction, to predict the NC-DIS in the PAN 0.9 where the second photon misses the ECAL. To check this concern, ordinary NC events, where charged tracks define the event, and, thereby, relieving the forward bias in the 1\u03b3 reconstruction due to the trigger requirement, are selected in data and MC. A single 1\u03b3 is selected downstream of the event. The charged tracks are ignored, the 1\u03b3 is subjected to the current analysis. The Data/MC ratio is examined in E \u03b3 and \u03b6 \u03b3 variables. The check reveals that the shapes of these variables in MC are consistent with those of data: the ratio is unity within \u00b15% in the kinematic range, well covered by the 12% error ascribed to the NC-DIS.

Additionally, we estimate the error in the 1\u03b3 reconstruction to be 2.5%, which has a negligible effect on this analysis. As a final check, we reproduced the results presented in [21].
