The collider delivered 12 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity and each experiment, CDF and DZero, acquired data corresponding to 10 fb \u22121 . These samples are now intensively analyzed by the CDF and DZero Collaborations, currently consisting of about 400 active members each, coming from about 60 (CDF) and 70 (DZero) institutions from across the World. The samples are well understood and, based on the mature analysis knowledge developed by both Collaborations, they provide an enormous potential for physics within and beyond the standard model. Up-to-date listings of the Tevatron Run II results can be found on the Web at the public pages of physics results of the two experiments [1].",

            "text": "Both Tevatron experiments have completed their program of searches for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson in all decay channels, using the full luminosity in all channels [2]. The top left window of Fig. 1 shows the combined exclusion limits of the searches from both experiments in all channels at the 95% confidence level (CL) as a function of the Higgs boson mass hypothesis. The dashed line shows the expected limit assuming no Higgs boson (null hypothesis) with the corresponding oneand two-standard deviation (st.d.) uncertainty bands. The solid line shows the observed limit. The Higgs boson is excluded between 150 and 180 GeV/c 2 , mainly by the H\u2192WW channel. There is an observed excess over the expected limit between for the null hypothesis between 115 and 150 GeV/c 2 , arising mainly from the H\u2192bb channel. The significance of the excess at 125 GeV/c 2   The couplings of the SM Higgs boson to the weak bosons and to fermions were derived from the cross sections times branching ratios (BR) measured in all decay channels by both experiments, accounting for all production modes [2]. The top right window of Fig. 1 shows the fermionic (\u03ba f ) and bosonic (\u03ba V ) couplings (\u03ba = 1 means SM coupling) derived from the measurements, with the corresponding one-and two-st.d. uncertainty regions. The result is consistent with the SM prediction. The sign degeneracy arises from the quadratic dependence of the cross sections and BRs on the couplings.",

This observation verified the SM prediction for that process. Recently, the two experiments measured the cross section for s-channel single top production using their full datasets and both reported evidence for this sub-process, with an observed significance of 4.2 st.d. for CDF [7] and 3.8 st.d. for DZero [8]. DZero measured the cross section in the tb\u2192lepton+bb topology, whereas CDF measured the cross section in both the tb\u2192lepton+bb and the tb\u2192 E T +bb topologies and combined the two results. A top quark mass of 172.5 GeV/c 2 was assumed in all measurements. The two experiments combined their results to obtain the first observation of s-channel single top production [9], with an expected siginficance of 5.

This asymmetry depends on the initial state, which is CP-invariant at the Tevatron, and it originates from the interference of the leading-order (LO) tt production mechanisms with nextto-leading-order (NLO) mechanisms, but also with possible mechanisms beyond the standard model (BSM). Fig. 4 on the top left shows the normalized cross section for tt production differential in the top quark angle about the initial-state proton direction in the tt rest frame, measured at CDF from tt\u2192lepton+jets events [10] and compared with the NLO SM prediction. The measured cross section is clearly asymmetric, with an asymmetry stronger than the prediction. CDF analyzed the asymmetry in terms of Legendre moments and found that only the first moment deviates significantly from the NLO SM prediction, as shown on the top right window of Fig. 4. More recently, DZero also measured the asymmetry from tt\u2192lepton+jets events as a function of the tt invariant mass [11]. The results are shown in the bottom left window of Fig. 4, compared with the CDF results [12] and the NLO SM prediction. The current status of the inclusive asymmetry measurements using the full Tevatron luminosity and the NLO SM prediction is summarized in the bottom right window of Fig. 4  [13]. With the new DZero measurements, the tension with the NLO SM prediction is reduced and the average of the measurements shows a moderate agreement with the prediction.",

CDF recently updated the measurements of the top mass in the all-jets [15] and dilepton [16] decay modes of tt events using the full luminosity and the template method to extract the mass from the data. In this method, the top mass distribution is reconstructed from the tt  events simulated with different input top mass values (making some assumptions for the undetected neutrinos in the dilepton case) and from simulated background events, and then it is fit to the experimental distribution reconstructed from the tt candidate events in the data. In the all-jets measurement, the reconstructed mass of the hadronically decaying W bosons that originate from the top quark decays is used to constrain the energy scale of jets originating from light quarks, which is typically the source of largest systematic uncertainty in top mass measurements. This technique, called \"in situ\" jet energy scale (JES) calibration, is not possible in the dilepton measurement, where the W bosons decay leptonically and the undetected neutrinos from their decays do not allow for reconstruction of the W mass. Fig. 6 shows the fits for the all-jets (top left) and dilepton (top right) measurements, with the background-only and the signal+background templates, and the data points. The derived top mass values are (175.07\u00b11.19 stat \u00b11.55 syst ) GeV/c 2 = (175.07\u00b11.95) GeV/c 2 from the all-jets fit and (170.80\u00b11.83 stat \u00b12.69 syst ) GeV/c 2 = (170.80\u00b13.26) GeV/c 2 from the dilepton fit, both dominated by the total systematic uncertainty.",

In this method, the sensitivity of the SM cross section for tt production on the top mass is used to derive the mass by fitting the event yield for background and signal, as a function of the top mass, to the data. Like in the all-jets decay mode, the reconstructed mass from the hadronically decaying W boson originating from one top quark in the event is used for an \"in situ\" JES calibration. The bottom left window of Fig. 6 shows the two-dimensional fit of the top mass and JES with the one-, two-and three-st.d. contours. The result for the top mass is (174.98\u00b10.58 stat+JES \u00b10.49 syst ) GeV/c 2 = (174.98\u00b10.76) GeV/c 2 , which is currently the most precise single measurement of the top mass from the Tevatron.

The Tevatron provided the first evidence for the standard model Higgs boson in fermionic final states. Precision measurements in the electroweak and QCD areas were performed, including measurements of jet, photon, weak boson, and diboson production cross sections. Perhaps the most important measurement regarding precision is that of the W boson mass -the most precise measurement of this fundamental parameter of the SM to date. Substantial progress was made in the physics of heavy flavor states and mixing, while several cases of subtle behavior have been identified and resolved, such as CP violation in heavy-flavored hadrons and the forward-backward asymmetry in top pair production. The volume of production of physics results from the Tevatron is represented by the number of publications per year in peer-reviewed journals, which is shown in the top two windows of Fig. 11. The total number of such publications from both experiments exceeds 1,100 over the last 25 years. In hardware developments, tracking and collision vertex reconstruction using silicon detector were taken to a whole new level. Heavy flavor tagging was widely developed and used. The entire trigger concept in a hadron collider environment was reconsidered and advanced, including the secondary vertex trigger (SVT) and out-of-time triggers for the detection of long-living or slow particles. In the domain of data analysis, the importance of multivariate techniques was established in cases such as the search for the SM Higgs boson in the bb final state and the observation of single top quark production, where the signal is tiny relative to the irreducible background and does not have a clear resonance signature in a reconstructed invariant mass spectrum.

A huge legacy in science and technology is inherited to the high-energy physics community after 25 years of research and development. This legacy is represented by more than 1,100 publications in peer-reviewed journals and more than 1,000 PhD theses from both experimements. The huge impact on new generation experiments seals the success of the Tevatron program and paves the way for future advances in high energy physics.",
