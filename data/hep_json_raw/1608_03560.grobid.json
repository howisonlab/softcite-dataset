The analysis uses events selected from the proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-ofmass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , with 666 tt and single top quark candidate events containing a reconstructed J/\u03c8 candidate decaying into an oppositely-charged muon pair. The mass of the (J/\u03c8 + ) system, where is an electron or a muon from W boson decay, is used to extract a top quark mass of 173.5 \u00b1 3.0 (stat) \u00b1 0.9 (syst) GeV.",

These measurements are currently dominated by systematic uncertainties, related to the b-jet energy scale and the modeling of soft quantum chromodynamics (QCD) effects such as b quark hadronization and the underlying event [6,7]. Currently, the most precise measurement of m t , 172.44 \u00b1 0.13 (stat) \u00b1 0.47 (syst) GeV, is from the combination of measurements at 7 and 8 TeV by the CMS experiment [7].",

            "text": "In this paper, a measurement is presented of m t from partial reconstruction of top quarks in leptonic final states that contain a J/\u03c8 meson from a b hadron decay. Both top quark-antiquark pair (tt) and single top quark production are considered to be signal in this study. The decay mode of interest is t \u2192 (W \u2192 \u03bd) (b \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 + X) and -1 - is shown (for tt production) in figure 1. Here and everywhere, the charge conjugation is implicit. As suggested in ref. [8] and refined in ref. [9], the value of m t is determined through its correlation with the mass of the J/\u03c8 + system, where is either an electron or muon produced in the decay of the accompanying W boson (either directly or via a \u03c4 lepton) in the same top quark decay. The branching fraction is expected to be (1.5 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , but the presence of three leptons in the final state, two of which originate from the J/\u03c8 meson decay, provides a nearly background-free sample of events. This measurement is based on data collected in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Simulated events generated at different top quark masses are used to calibrate the method and evaluate its performance, as well as to estimate systematic uncertainties. The main advantage of this analysis lies in the determination of m t using only leptons. In this way, the dependence of the measurement on several dominant systematic uncertainties linked to initial-and final-state radiation, jet reconstruction and b tagging techniques, is considerably reduced. The drawback is the expected sensitivity to the modeling of b quark fragmentation, and the limited number of events in the selected sample on account of the small branching fraction.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The tracker has a track-finding efficiency of more than 99% for muons with transverse momentum p T > 1 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL is a fine-grained calorimeter with quasi-projective geometry, and consists of a barrel JHEP12(2016)123 region of |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| of 3.0. The HCAL barrel and endcaps similarly cover the region |\u03b7| < 3.0. Muons are measured in the |\u03b7| < 2.4 range, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1-2% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [10]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate systems and kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [11].",

The LO CTEQ6L1 [16] parton distribution function (PDF) set and the Z2* underlying event tune are used in the generation. The most recent pythia Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [17], which uses the CTEQ5L parton distribution set, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L. Matrix elements describing up to three partons in addition to the tt pair are included in the MadGraph generator, and the MLM prescription [18] is used for matching of matrix-element jets to parton showers. The Lund string model [19] is used for the simulation of the hadronization, and to determine the fraction of the quark energy carried by unstable hadrons. For heavy quarks, the Lund symmetric fragmentation function is modified according to the Bowler space-time picture of string evolution [20]. Assuming fragmentation universality [21,22], the values of the parameters of the fragmentation function obtained from fits to the LEP data [23] are used, without assigning a systematic uncertainty associated to the universality assumption.

Charged particles are required to originate from the primary collision vertex, identified as the reconstructed vertex with the largest value of p 2 T for its associated tracks.

To reduce the combinatorial background, a Kalman vertex fit [38,39] with one degree of freedom is performed and the \u03c7 2 of the vertex is required to be less than 5. The significance (i.e., the number of standard deviations) of the distance between the secondary vertex -formed by the products of the b quark fragmentationand the primary vertex of the event is required to be above 20. These criteria select 666 events in data. The numbers of events expected from the SM processes are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and the results are normalized to their theoretical cross sections. These are noted in table 1, where a distinction is made between events in which the isolated lepton with the largest p T is a muon, labeled \"Leading \u00b5\", and events in which the leading isolated lepton is an electron, labeled \"Leading e\", but not between lepton+jets and dileptonic event candidates. The rates predicted by the default simulation are in fair agreement with those observed in data. The event sample is dominated by contributions from lepton+jets and dilepton tt events, with a lesser contribution from single top quark processes. Figure 2 shows the dimuon invariant mass spectrum (for a wider mass range than the acceptance window for the J/\u03c8 meson candidates) and the p T distribution of the J/\u03c8 meson candidates. The simulation used in this figure and the following ones is for m t = 172.5 GeV. The ratio in the number of events observed in data to the number expected from simulation is presented in the lower panel. The shaded band includes statistical and systematic uncertainties, which are discussed below, as well as the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The number of J/\u03c8 meson candidates is roughly the same in data and simulation. Despite the corrections applied to the muon p T scale, a worse resolution is observed in data than in simulation. This is caused by final-state radiation emitted by the muons originating from the J/\u03c8 meson decay, which is not included in the simulation [40] and which results in a shift of the reconstructed dimuon invariant mass in the simulation to larger values. This effect is included in the systematic uncertainties discussed in section 4.1. 3 Extraction of the top quark mass",

The means and widths of the pull distributions are found to be constant in m t and compatible with 0 and 1 within their respective statistical uncertainties. The method to extract m t from the m J/\u03c8+ distribution can therefore be considered as unbiased. Each of the six mass points results in a mean and width from the residual distribution, which are interpolated to m t = 172.5 GeV. The spread of the mean values is used to estimate the systematic uncertainty arising from the size of the simulated event samples (0.22 GeV) and the width values are used to derive the expected statistical uncertainty for the data (2.9 GeV).",

The tt simulated event samples used for the measurement are produced with the default Z2* tune, with a correction applied to the fitted result so as to use the Z2* LEP r b tune as a baseline. These two tunes are based upon data collected at LEP and elsewhere. Porting an MC simulation tune from LEP to LHC implies the assumption of the factorization between the perturbative and nonperturbative parts in the shower evolution, which are typically fitted together, and the noncorrelation of these fits with the color structure of the event, which is clearly different in e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb and pp \u2192 tt \u2192 bW \u2212 bW + events. These differences are considered to be covered by the underlying event and color reconnection modeling uncertainty. The uncertainty stemming from the modeling of the b hadron decay induces variations of the b hadron relative p T that are much smaller than the uncertainty in r b for the Z2* LEP r b tune [47]. Thus, only the effect of fragmentation parameters constrained by the LEP data is considered as an additional source of systematic uncertainty, assigning the maximum difference between the m t values obtained for the Z2* LEP r \u00b1 b and Z2* LEP r b tunes, shown in figure 6, as the systematic uncertainty stemming from the fragmentation modeling. The size of the uncertainty is found to be comparable to the one estimated in a different way in ref. [9].",

An event selection is implemented in proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV, to obtain a sample of high purity leptonically-decaying top quarks in tt and single top quark production events containing one J/\u03c8 meson candidate that decays into an oppositely-charged muon pair. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . There are 355 events observed with a muon and 311 with an electron as leading isolated lepton, in agreement with expectations from simulation. The top quark mass is extracted from an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the invariant mass of the leading lepton and J/\u03c8 meson candidate. The resulting m t measurement is 173.5 GeV, with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 GeV and a systematic uncertainty of 0.9 GeV. This is the first time that this method has been applied to a physics analysis and the systematic uncertainty is of the same order of magnitude as that estimated in ref. [9]. Even though the results are statistically limited, the dominant systematic uncertainties are different from those of the most precise direct reconstruction methods. As the sensitivity to jet-related uncertainties is negligible, this allows the possibility to contribute significantly in combination with other m t measurements. Furthermore, with the larger data set expected in the next runs of the LHC, the method described in this paper will provide a result which will be more competitive with those obtained from the conventional reconstruction techniques.",
