In the next decade, accelerator upgrades are expected in various facilities, making it feasible to have continuous beams with an intensity of 10 9 or even 10 10 muons per second. We investigate the experimental limiting factors that will define the ultimate performances, and hence the sensitivity, in the search for \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 with a continuous beam at these extremely high rates. We then consider some conceptual detector designs and evaluate the corresponding sensitivity as a function of the beam intensity.",

Lepton flavor conservation is anyway an accidental symmetry: a mere consequence of the particle content of the model, following namely from the absence of right handed neutrinos. Actually, this symmetry is not exact, as already demonstrated by the discovery of neutrino oscillations, but the impact on charged lepton decays is negligible, giving for instance a predicted branching ratio (BR) for the \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 decay around 10 \u221254 , well below the current experimental limit, BR(\u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3) < 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u221213 [1].",

Projects to reach a muon beam rate of 10 9 or even 10 10 muons per second are under considerations at the PSI [2] and elsewhere [3,4]. In these kinds of facilities, muons come from the decay of pions produced by a proton beam impinging on a fixed target. At the PSI, a high intensity muon beam line (HiMB) is studied, which should be able to increase by a factor >4 the muon capture efficiency at the production target, thanks to a new design of the solenoid magnets used to convey the muons into the beam line, and by a factor \u223c7 the transport efficiency from the production target to the experimental halls, thanks to an improved beam optics. The main limitation at the PSI comes from the fact that the proton beam needs to be mostly preserved to serve a neutron spallation source downstream of the muon production target. Hence, a thin target is used and only 18% of the original 2 mA beam is used to produce muons. At RCNP (Japan), the MuSIC project aims to use a thicker target in order to get a similar production rate with a much lower proton beam intensity. It requires a magnetic field at the production target to collect pions and muons with a large acceptance and a magnetic field adiabatically changing from 3.5 T at the center of the target to 2 T at the exit of the capture solenoid to improve the acceptance of the beamline. The tests already performed showed that \u223c10 6 muons per Watt of proton beam power can be produced. Some studies are also ongoing for the production of continuous muon beams in the context of the PIP-II project at Fermilab (Batavia, IL, USA).",

Positive muons were used in these experiments, in order to avoid their capture in the target nuclei, which would distort the energy spectrum of the decay products. In order to get an intense muon beam with low contamination of pions and electrons, the beam lines were tuned to transport particles of about 28 MeV/c of momentum, corresponding to muons produced by pions decaying at rest just at the surface of the production target. Muons of such a low momentum can be stopped by thin targets, and typically a few hundred microns of plastic material are sufficient for that purpose. The muons decay at rest and the two-body \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 kinematics is exploited, by looking for a positron and a photon emitted back to back, with equal energies (neglecting the electron mass),",

In a calorimetric approach, a fast and luminous inorganic scintillating material is used to measure the photon energy, time and position at the detector. Alternatively, thin layers of dense material can be used to produce a photon conversion to e + e \u2212 , and the two charged particles are tracked in a magnetic field to determine the photon energy and conversion point. The first approach, used in the last several decades by the CrystalBox [6] and MEG [7] experiments, gives a relatively high efficiency (>60% in MEG), while the resolutions are determined by the physical properties of the scintillating material. The MEG experiment, and its upgrade MEG II [8] (currently under construction) have a liquid Xe (LXe) calorimeter, with an homogeneous volume of 900 , giving very good energy (\u223c2%) and time (\u223c60 ps) resolutions. The second approach, adopted for the MEGA experiment [9], suffers from a very low efficiency (a few percent per conversion layer) due to the low conversion probability, but allows for reaching extremely good resolutions, which, according to the discussion above, can allow for exploiting a higher beam rate to recover the loss of efficiency. Neither techniques provide a precise determination of the photon direction. It is more precisely determined by tracking the positron back to the target, assuming that the photon comes from the same place, and taking the line joining this point to the photon conversion point as the photon direction. Nonetheless, the conversion technique gives some information about the photon direction, as the combination of the directions of the e + e \u2212 pair. This supplementary information can be used to require the photon and the positron to come approximately from the same point, and it helps to reduce the accidental background.",

For this reason, gaseous detectors give the best performances and have been used in the latest experiments. The Mu3e collaboration use a silicon vertex tracker for the search of \u00b5 + \u2192 e + e + e \u2212 [11], and a similar design has been suggested for future \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 searches [12], considering that very thin sensors are now available, with a thickness of 50 \u00b5m Si + 25 \u00b5m Kapton per layer [13], for a total of \u223c10 \u22123 radiation lengths per layer. For comparison, in MEG or MEG II, the material seen by a typical track in the spectrometer is less than 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 radiation lengths, and nonetheless the contribution to the resolution from the multiple Coulomb scattering is a significant factor in MEG and will almost be dominant in MEG II. As a consequence, no more than a few silicon layers could be used. According to simulations [12], an energy resolution of \u223c200 keV could be reached, while gaseous detectors can perform much better [8].",

On the other hand, the thickness of the target is dictated by the necessity of stopping a large fraction of the incoming muons. A good strategy to optimize the resolutions and the stopping power consists in slanting the target with respect to the beam axis. If the normal vector to the target plane forms an angle \u03b1 with the beam axis, muons see an effective thickness enlarged by 1/ cos(\u03b1), while the typical thickness seen by positrons is magnified only by a factor 1/ sin(\u03b1). An angle \u03b1 = 70 \u2022 was used in MEG and \u03b1 = 76 \u2022 will be used in MEG II. Nonetheless, if a 90% stopping efficiency is required, simulations suggest that the contribution to the angular resolutions is always larger than 3 mrad, even with Beryllium, the material which gives the best performances. In addition, reducing the thickness by accepting a loos off stopping efficiency is not feasible: the target has to be placed at the Bragg peak to have a reasonable stopping efficiency, and muons not stopped in the target would decay in the gas just after the target, giving a contribution to the background without increasing the signal rate. Hence, a positron angle resolution better than a few mrad cannot be obtained with conventional techniques.",
