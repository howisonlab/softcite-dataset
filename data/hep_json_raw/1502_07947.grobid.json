The integrated luminosities are approximately 7 \u00b5b \u22121 , 190 \u00b5b \u22121 and 12.4 nb \u22121 for 0.9 TeV, 7 TeV minimum-bias and 7 TeV high-multiplicity data samples, respectively. The multiplicity dependence of the BEC parameters characterizing the correlation strength and the correlation source size are investigated for charged-particle multiplicities of up to 240. A saturation effect in the multiplicity dependence of the correlation source size parameter is observed using the high-multiplicity 7 TeV data sample. The dependence of the BEC parameters on the average transverse momentum of the particle pair is also investigated.",

Correlations between identical bosons, called Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC), are a well-known phenomenon in high-energy and nuclear physics (for reviews see [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]). The BEC are often considered to be the analogue of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect [13][14][15] in astronomy, describing the interference of incoherently emitted identical bosons [16][17][18][19]. They represent a sensitive probe of the space-time geometry of the hadronization region and allow the determination of the size and the shape of the source from which particles are emitted.",

            "text": "Studies of the dependence of BEC on particle multiplicity and transverse momentum are of special interest. They help to understand the multiparticle production mechanism. The size of the source emitting the correlated particles has been observed to increase with particle multiplicity. This can be understood as arising from the increase in the initial geometrical region of overlap of the colliding objects [22]: a large overlap implies a large multiplicity. While this dependence is natural in nucleus-nucleus collisions, the increase of size with multiplicity has also been observed in hadronic and leptonic interactions. In the latter, it is understood as a result of superposition of many sources [8,[23][24][25][26][27] or related to the number of jets [28,29]. High-multiplicity data in proton-proton interactions can serve as a reference for studies of nucleus-nucleus collisions. The effect is reproduced in both the hydrodynamical/hydrokinetic [30][31][32] and Pomeron-based [33,34] approaches for hadronic interactions where high multiplicities play a crucial role. The dependence on the transverse momentum of the emitter particle pair is another important feature of the BEC effect [35]. In nucleusnucleus collisions the dependence of the particle emitter size on the transverse momentum is explained as a \"collective flow\", which generates a characteristic fall-off of the emitter size with increasing transverse momentum [36][37][38] while strong space-time momentum-energy correlations may offer an explanation in more \"elementary\" leptonic and hadronic systems [6,7,9,[30][31][32]35] where BEC measurements serve as a test of different models [30][31][32][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46].",

The Q R dependence comes from the Fourier transform of the distribution of the space-time points of boson emission. Several different functional forms have been proposed for (\u03bb, Q R). Those used in this paper are described in Sect. 2.4. The fitted parameter \u03b5 takes into account longdistance correlations not fully removed from \u03c1 0 . Finally, C 0 is a normalization constant, typically chosen such that C 2 (Q) is unity for large Q. In this paper, the density function \u03c1 is calculated for like-sign charged-particle pairs, with both the ++ and \u2212\u2212 combinations included, \u03c1(Q) \u2261 \u03c1(++, \u2212\u2212). All particles are treated as charged pions and no particle identification is attempted. The purity of the analysis sample in terms of identical boson pairs is estimated from MC to be about 70 % (where about 69 % are \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 and about 1 % are K \u00b1 K \u00b1 ). The effect of the purity is absorbed in the strength parameter \u03bb, while the results of the analysis on the effective radius parameter R were found to be not affected.",

Ideally, \u03c1 0 (Q) should include all momentum correlations except those arising from BEC. Thus, several different choices have been studied to construct an appropriate reference sample. Most of the proposed approaches use random pairing of particles, such as mixing particles from different events (the \"mixed event\" technique [56]), or choosing them from the same event but from opposite hemispheres or by rotating the transverse momentum vector of one of the particles of the like-sign pair [9]. Although these mixing techniques reproduce the topology and some properties of the event under consideration and destroy BEC, they violate energy-momentum conservation. Moreover, there are many possible ways to construct the pairs, such as mixing the particles randomly, or keeping some topological constraints such as the event multiplicity, the invariant mass of the pair or the rapidity of the pair. All of these introduce additional biases in the BEC observables. For example, it was observed in dedicated MC studies that the single-ratio correlation functions C 2 using reference samples constructed with the event mixing or opposite hemispheres techniques exhibit an increase in the low-Q BEC sensitive region. This effect is found to be more pronounced with increase of the multiplicity or average particlepair transverse momentum and indicates that these reference samples are not suitable.",

The decrease of the \u03bb parameter with n ch is found to be well fitted with the exponential function \u03bb(n ch ) = \u03b3 e \u2212\u03b4n ch . The fit parameter values are presented in Table 2 for 0.9 TeV and for the combined nominal and high-multiplicity 7 TeV data.  The R parameter increases with multiplicity up to about n ch 50 independently of the center of mass energy. For higher multiplicities, the measured R parameter is observed to be independent of multiplicity. For n ch \u2264 82 at 0.9 TeV and n ch < 55 at 7 TeV the n ch dependence of R is fitted with the function R(n ch ) = \u03b1 3 \u221a n ch , similar to that used in heavy-ion studies [5,51]. The results of the fit are presented in Table 2 and are close to the CMS results [49]. The fit parameters do not change significantly within uncertainties if data points with n ch > 55 are included in the fit, while the quality of the fit significantly degrades. Therefore the fit is limited to the data points with n ch \u2264 55.

The measurements presented here complement the earlier measurements by extending the studies to higher multiplicities and transverse momenta. This has allowed a first observation of a saturation in the magnitude of the source radius parameter at high charged-particle multiplicities, and confirms the exponential decrease, observed in previous measurements of the radius parameters with increasing pair transverse momenta.
