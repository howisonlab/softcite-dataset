The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities of 1.0 fb \u22121 and 2.0 fb \u22121 recorded at the centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively. The CP -violating asymmetry a T -odd CP is measured to be (0.18 \u00b1 0.29 (stat) \u00b1 0.04 (syst))%. Searches for CP violation in different regions of phase space of the four-body decay, and as a function of the D 0 decay time, are also presented. No significant deviation from the CP conservation hypothesis is found.",

A significant excess of CP violation (CP V ) with respect to the theoretical predictions would be a signature of physics beyond the SM. The study of CP V in singly Cabibbo-suppressed charm decays is uniquely sensitive to physics beyond the SM, in particular through new contributions in strong penguin and chromomagnetic dipole operators [2]. The analysis of singly Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u22121 decays allows localised CP V in different regions of phase space to be probed. This approach enhances the sensitivity due to several interfering amplitudes with different relative strong phases contributing to the decay.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + (29 GeV/c)/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of p transverse to the beam. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors [16]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [17]. The trigger [18] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.
