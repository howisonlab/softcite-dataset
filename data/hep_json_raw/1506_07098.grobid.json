Exclusive dilepton events have a clean signature that helps discriminate them from background: there are only two identified muons or electrons, without any other activity in the central detectors, and the leptons are back-to-back in azimuthal angle. Furthermore, due to the very small photon virtualities involved, the incident protons are scattered at almost zero-degree angles. Consequently, the measurement of exclusive \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 reactions was proposed for precise absolute luminosity measurement at hadron E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. colliders [5][6][7][8]. However, this process requires significant corrections (of the order of 20%) due to additional interactions between the elastically scattered protons [9,10].",

Recent phenomenological studies suggest that the exclusive \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 cross-section is suppressed by a factor that depends on the mass and rapidity of the system produced [10]. For the kinematic range relevant for this measurement the suppression factor is about 20%. This factor includes both the strong pp absorptive correction (\u223c8% suppression) and the photon-proton (\u03b3 p) coherence condition (b \u03b3 p > r p , where b \u03b3 p is the \u03b3 p impact parameter and r p the transverse size of the proton).",

Furthermore, the simulated samples are weighted such that the z-position distribution of reconstructed pp interaction vertices matches the distribution observed in data.

Scale factors are applied to the simulated samples to correct for the small differences from data in the trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies for electrons and muons [54][55][56]. MC events are also corrected to take into account differences from data in lepton energy, momentum scale and resolution [55,57]. The multi-jet background is determined using data-driven methods, similarly to Refs. [44,58]. For the e + e \u2212 channel, the multi-jet sample is obtained by applying the full nominal preselection but requiring the electron candidates to not satisfy the medium identification criteria. For the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channel, it is extracted using same-charge muon pairs that satisfy the remaining preselection criteria.

The z iso vtx distribution for events with no additional tracks at the dilepton vertex is presented in Fig. 1(a). The structure observed at small z iso vtx values is due to the vertex finding algorithm, which identifies the vertex as two close vertices in high-multiplicity DY events: the two-track vertex formed from the lepton tracks and the vertex from the UE tracks.

Since these variations are strongly correlated with the statistical uncertainties, no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned in this case. Table 2 summarises the contributions to the systematic uncertainty on the exclusive cross-sections from the different sources. The total systematic uncertainty is formed by adding the individual contributions in quadrature for each analysis channel, including the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity. Control distributions of the dilepton transverse momentum for events satisfying the selection criteria listed in Table 1 are shown in Fig. 3, with the exclusive and single-dissociative yields normalised according to the fit results. Here an additional cut on the dilepton acoplanarity (1 \u2212 | \u03c6 + \u2212 | /\u03c0 < 0.008) is used, instead of the cut on total transverse momentum (p + \u2212 T < 1.5 GeV).

The corresponding data-to-EPA signal ratios for the electron and muon channels are consistent with the recent CMS measurement and indicate a suppression of the exclusive production mechanism in data with respect to EPA prediction. The observed cross-sections are about 20% below the nominal EPA prediction, and consistent with the suppression expected due to proton absorption contributions. The MC predictions for the shapes of the dilepton kinematic distributions, including both the exclusive signal and the background dominated by two-photon production of lepton pairs with single-proton dissociation, are also found to be in good agreement with the data.
