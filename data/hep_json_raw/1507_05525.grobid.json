This paper reports the results of new interpretations and statistical combinations of previously published analyses, as well as a new analysis. Since no significant excess of events over the Standard Model expectation is observed, the data are used to set limits in a variety of models. In all the considered simplified models that assume R-parity conservation, the limit on the gluino mass exceeds 1150 GeV at 95% confidence level, for an LSP mass smaller than 100 GeV. Furthermore, exclusion limits are set for left-handed squarks in a phenomenological MSSM model, a minimal Supergravity/Constrained MSSM model, R-parity-violation scenarios, a minimal gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model, a natural gauge mediation model, a non-universal Higgs mass model with gaugino mediation and a minimal model of universal extra dimensions.",

If R-parity is conserved [10][11][12][13], SUSY particles (called sparticles) are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The scalar partners of the left-and right-handed quarks, the squarks (q L andq R which mix to form two mass eigenstatesq 1 andq 2 , ordered by increasing mass), and the fermionic partners of the gluons, gluinos (g), could be produced in strong interaction processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [14] and decay via cascades ending with a stable LSP. The rest of the cascade would yield final states with multiple jets and possibly leptons arising from the decay of sleptons (\u02dc ), the superpartners of leptons, or W , Z and Higgs (h) bosons originating from the decays of charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 ) or neutralinos (\u03c7 0 ), where the charginos and neutralinos",

In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) [10][11][12][13]15], there are four charginos,\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 \u00b1 , and four neutralinos,\u03c7 0 i (i = 1 to 4, ordered by increasing mass); unless stated otherwise, this is assumed in the following. In a large variety of models, the LSP is the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ), which interacts weakly and is a possible candidate for dark matter [16]. Undetected\u03c7 0 1 LSPs would result in substantial missing transverse momentum (E miss T , with magnitude E miss T ). Significant E miss T can also arise in R-parity-violating (RPV) scenarios in which the LSP decays to final states containing neutrinos or in scenarios where neutrinos are present in the cascade decay chains of the produced SUSY particles. Significant mass splitting between the top squark (stop) mass eigenstatest 1 andt 2 is possible due to the large top Yukawa coupling. 1 Because of the SM weak isospin symmetry the mass of the left-handed bottom squark (sbottom,b L ) is tied to the mass of the left-handed stop (t L ), and as a consequence the lightest sbottom (b 1 ) and stop (t 1 ) could be produced via the strong interaction with relatively large cross-sections at the LHC, either through direct pair production or in the decay of pair-produced gluinos.",

This paper provides a summary of the results from inclusive searches for gluinos and first-and second-generation squarks performed by ATLAS, using data from proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected during Run 1 of the LHC. The results for direct production of third-generation squarks are reported elsewhere [18]. In addition to summarizing already published searches for squarks and gluinos, this paper presents new signal regions, new interpretations and statistical combinations of those searches, as well as an additional search using the Razor variable set [19], thus improving the sensitivity to supersymmetric models. In order to differentiate strongly produced SUSY events from the SM background, the searches typically require high E miss T due to the presence of the LSP and possibly neutrinos, several high-p T jets and large deposited transverse energy. They are further classified according to the presence of leptons and b-jets. A first class of searches applies a veto on leptons [20][21][22], a second considers final states containing electrons and muons [23][24][25], and a third requires tau leptons in the final state [26]. A fourth class of searches concentrates on final states containing multiple b-jets [27].",

A description of the analysis strategy is given in section 6, and the experimental signatures are presented in section 7. A summary of systematic uncertainties is presented in section 8. Results obtained using the new signal regions with selections similar to those used in previous publications as well as the new analysis using the Razor variable set are reported in section 9. The strategy used for the combination of the results from different analyses is discussed in section 10. Limits in phenomenological and simplified models are presented in section 11. Section 12 is devoted to a summary and conclusions.",

            "text": "Since no superpartners of any of the SM particles have been observed, SUSY, if realized in nature, must be a broken symmetry with a mechanism for breaking the symmetry taking place at a higher energy scale. It is difficult to construct a realistic model of spontaneously broken low-energy supersymmetry where the SUSY breaking arises solely as a consequence of the interactions of the particles of the MSSM [28][29][30]. Therefore, it is often assumed that the SUSY breaking originates in a \"hidden\" sector, and its effects are transmitted to the MSSM by some unknown mechanism. Various such mechanisms have been proposed, such as gravity-mediated SUSY breaking (SUGRA) [31][32][33][34][35][36], gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) [37][38][39][40][41][42] and anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB) [43,44]. As a result, these models consider only a small part of the parameter space of the more general MSSM. In such SUSY models, the particle spectrum is typically specified by fixing parameters at the high scale. In order to translate this set of parameters into physically meaningful quantities that describe physics near the electroweak scale, it is necessary to evolve them using their renormalization group equations.",

Unless otherwise specified, R-parity is assumed to be conserved and the lightest neutralino,\u03c7 0 1 , is taken to be the LSP. The phenomenological models include a scenario for the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [49][50][51], minimal Supergravity/Constrained MSSM (mSUGRA/CMSSM) [31][32][33][34][35][36], bilinear Rparity violation (bRPV) [52], a minimal gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model (mGMSB) [37][38][39][40][41][42], natural gauge mediation (nGM) [53], and a non-universal Higgs mass model with gaugino mediation (NUHMG) [54]. The simplified models presented here include the pair production of gluinos or first-and second-generation squarks with various hypotheses for their decay chains (direct, one-step or two-step decay), as well as gluino decays via real or virtual third-generation squarks. Direct decays are those where the considered SUSY particles decay directly into SM particles and the LSP, e.g.,q \u2192 q\u03c7 0 1 .",

Various models assume that the mass hierarchies of squarks and sleptons are generated by the same physics responsible for breaking SUSY (for example refs. [65,66]). Typically in these models the third generation of squarks and sleptons is lighter than the other two, and together with the fact that sleptons only acquire small masses through hypercharge interactions in gauge mediation, this leads to a stau NLSP. In the model considered here, it is also assumed that the gluino is the only light coloured sparticle. All squark and slepton mass parameters are set to 2.5 TeV except the lightest stau mass, m\u03c4 , which is assumed to be smaller. The parameters M 1 and M 2 are also set to 2.5 TeV, while all trilinear coupling terms are set to zero. The value of \u00b5 is set to 400 GeV to ensure that strong production dominates in the parameter space studied. This leaves the gluino mass M 3 and the stau mass m\u03c4 as the only free parameters. The chosen value of the \u00b5 parameter sets the masses of the\u03c7 , which are almost mass-degenerate. The only light sparticles in the model are the stau, a light gluino, higgsino-dominated charginos and neutralinos, and a very light gravitino LSP. Therefore, the strong production process allowed in this model is gluino-pair production followed by the three possible decay chains:",

The Sherpa Drell-Yan samples have a lepton filter requiring p 1 ( 2 ) T > 9 (5) GeV and |\u03b7 1 ( 2 ) | < 2.8.

The local cluster weighting (LCW) calibration method [127,128] is used to classify topoclusters as being either of electromagnetic or hadronic origin, and based on this classification it applies energy corrections derived from MC simulations and measurements in data. The jets are corrected for energy from pile-up using the method suggested in ref.

Further corrections, referred to as the jet energy scale (JES) corrections, are derived from MC simulation and data and used to calibrate on average the energies of jets to the scale of their constituent particles [127,131]. Only jet candidates with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 after all corrections are retained.

In some analyses, the shape of a final discriminating variable in the SRs is also used. A background-only fit is used to determine the compatibility of the observed event yield in each SR with the corresponding SM background expectation. This fit uses as constraints only the observed event yields or the shape of the discriminating variable distributions from the CRs associated with the SR, but not the SR itself. It is assumed that signal events from physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) do not contribute to these yields. The numbers of observed and predicted events in each of these CRs are described using Poisson probability density functions. The systematic uncertainties and the MC statistical uncertainties on the expected values are included in the fit as nuisance parameters which are constrained by Gaussian distributions with widths corresponding to the sizes of the uncertainties considered and Poisson distributions, respectively. Correlations of a given nuisance parameter across the various regions, between the various backgrounds, and possibly the signal, are taken into account. The product of the various probability density functions forms the likelihood, which the fit maximizes by adjusting the inputs to the fit and the nuisance parameters. The inputs to the fit for each of the SRs are the number of events observed in each of the CRs, and the corresponding number of events expected from simulation, the extrapolation factors obtained from the simulation which relate the number of predicted SM background events in their associated CR to that predicted in the SR, and the number of events predicted by the simulation in each region for the other background processes. The background fit results are cross-checked in validation regions. The data in the validation regions are not used to constrain the fits; they are only used to compare the results of the fits to statistically independent observations. A model-independent fit is used to set upper limits on the number of BSM signal events in each SR. This fit proceeds in the same way as the background-only fit, except that the number of events observed in the SR is added as an input to the fit, and the BSM signal strength, constrained to be non-negative, is added as a free parameter. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the number of events from BSM phenomena for each signal region (S 95 obs and S 95 exp ) are derived using the CL S prescription [143], neglecting any possible signal contamination in the control regions; an uncertainty on S 95 exp is also computed from the \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainty on the expectation.

The Razor variable set is designed to group together visible final-state particles associated with heavy produced sparticles, and in doing so contains information about the mass scale of those sparticles. The events are selected using a combination of E miss T triggers which are fully efficient for the event selections considered in this search.

The baseline object selection and event cleaning, as well as the choice of MC generators for SM background processes and the approach for calculating systematic uncertainties exactly follow those of the 0L search [20].

Different categories of events are defined in order to cover a broad parameter space: first the events are separated by different requirements on the transverse momentum of the leptons, either using an electron or muon with p T >25 GeV in the hard lepton selection, or an electron (muon) with p T > 7 (6) GeV in the soft lepton selection. Each of these selections is further subdivided into a single-lepton and a dilepton search channel. The soft and hard lepton channels are designed to be complementary, and are more sensitive to supersymmetric spectra with small or large mass splittings, respectively, while the different lepton multiplicities cover different production and decay modes. To enhance the sensitivity to gluino or squark production, high and low jet multiplicity signal regions, respectively, are defined. The single-lepton channels (1L(S,H)) use a statistically independent set of events, compared to the 0L search, allowing the statistical combination of the two searches in the models for which it is relevant. The hard dilepton channel (2LRaz) targets gluino and first-and second-generation squark production, as well as mUED searches. This channel uses a Razor variable set and is not designed to search for signal events in which a real Z boson is present. In all search channels except the soft dimuon channel (2L(S)), two separate selections are performed for each jet multiplicity: one single-bin signal region optimized for discovery reach, which is also used to place limits on the visible cross-section, and one signal region which is binned in an appropriate variable in order to exploit the expected shape of the distribution of signal events when placing model-dependent limits.",

The 1L(H) 7-jet signal region selection follows the concepts of the 1L(H) analysis [23], only modifying the criteria for the signal, validation and control regions to take into account a selection of events with at least seven jets in the final state. Due to these changes, a re-evaluation of the systematic uncertainties, in particular of the theoretical uncertainties on the background, is also performed. The selection criteria are summarized in table 10.",

One signal region with similar requirements to those used by the CMS experiment in a comparable search [148] which reported an excess of events above the SM background with a significance of 2.6 standard deviations, is also used for comparison purposes. No evidence for an excess is observed in this region. Another leptonic search channel [25] is used for an analysis of final states with multiple jets, and either two leptons of the same electric charge or at least three leptons (SS/3L). The motivation for searches using these final states is that pair-produced gluinos have the same probability to decay to pairs of leptons with the same charge as with opposite charge. Squark production (directly in pairs or throughgg orgq production with subsequentg \u2192 qq decay) can also lead to same-sign lepton or three-lepton signatures when the squarks decay in cascades involving top quarks, charginos, neutralinos or sleptons. Requiring a pair of leptons with the same electric charge largely suppresses the background coming from the SM processes, giving a very clean and powerful signature to search for new physics processes. It also allows the use of relatively loose kinematic requirements on E miss T , increasing the sensitivity to scenarios with small mass differences between SUSY particles or with R-parity violation. Five statistically independent signal regions are defined: two signal regions requiring same-sign leptons and b-jets (optimized for gluino decays via top squarks), a complementary signal region requiring a b-jet veto (optimized for the gluino decays via first-and second-generation squarks), and two signal regions requiring three leptons (designed for scenarios characterized by multi-step decays).",

In particular, models with light tau sleptons are consistent with dark-matter searches [152]. Four distinct topologies are studied in order to optimize the tau + jets + E miss T (TAU) search for various models: one hadronically decaying tau (1\u03c4 ) or two or more hadronically decaying taus (2\u03c4 ) in the final state with no additional light leptons (e/\u00b5) and one or more tau leptons with exactly one lepton (one electron (\u03c4 + e) or muon (\u03c4 + \u00b5)). The different topologies (1\u03c4 , 2\u03c4 and \u03c4 + , where is electron or muon) have been optimized separately, and, where relevant, are statistically combined to increase the analysis sensitivity. The same signal regions are used for additional model interpretations, not presented in ref. [26]. These are simplified models of squark-or gluino-pair production where the squark or gluino undergoes a two-step cascade decay via sleptons, as shown in figures 5(a) and 5(c), where the sleptons are assumed to be exclusively staus, since the first two generations of sleptons and sneutrinos are kinematically decoupled.",

These uncertainties are dominated by the modelling of the Z+jets process and by the uncertainties on diboson production due to renormalization and factorization scales and PDF uncertainties for which a conservative uniform 50% uncertainty is applied. In the additional signal region for the 1-lepton (hard) + jets + E miss T analysis, 1L(H) 7-jet, the overall background uncertainty is estimated to be 35%, and it is dominated by the modelling of the tt process in the events with high jet multiplicity. The estimated background uncertainties in the two additional signal regions for the 0-lepton + 2-6 jets + E miss T analysis, 0L 4jt+ and 0L 5jt, are consistent with the uncertainties obtained for the two closest signal regions (4jt and 5j) from the original publication [20].",

Table 11 summarizes the results for the two JHEP10(2015)054 additional signal regions for the 0L analysis. Table 12 displays the equivalent results for the two signal regions of the new 0LRaz analysis, and those for the additional region of the 1L(H) analysis are shown in table 13. All results are determined using the backgroundonly fit. The pre-fit background expectations are also shown in the tables, for comparison purposes. The prediction of the W/Z+jets background processes by the simulation prior to the fit is found to be overestimated in the phase space of interest and is consequently decreased by the fit. This is consistent with the behaviour observed in previous publications probing a similar phase space [20]. In all new signal regions presented in this paper the number of events observed is consistent with the post-fit SM expectations. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% CL on the number of BSM events (S 95 obs and S 95 exp ), together with the upper limits on the visible cross-section of BSM physics ( \u03c3 95 obs ) and the p-value for the background-only hypothesis, are also presented in the tables 11-13. The confidence levels are calculated with the CL S prescription [143]. For an observed number of events lower than expected, the p-value is truncated at 0.5.",

The conditions are satisfied for a combination of the 1L(S,H) and 0L searches. These analyses search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing jets and missing transverse momentum, either with at least one isolated electron or muon (1L(S,H)), or applying an explicit veto on events containing electrons or muons (0L). They are statistically independent due to a veto on any electron or muon with p T > 10 GeV in the case of the 0L search, and requiring an electron or muon with p T (e/\u00b5) > 25 GeV (hard single-lepton) or p T (e/\u00b5) > 7/6 GeV (soft single-lepton) in the case of the 1L(S,H) search. It has been checked explicitly that the difference in lepton-p T thresholds in the 0L and soft single-lepton analyses does not result in events selected by both analyses. The control regions used to estimate contributions from W +jets and top backgrounds used by the 0L search have been slightly modified with respect to the original regions [20] such that events which are selected by the respective control regions in the 1L(S,H) analyses are vetoed.

Here and in sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3, unless otherwise stated, the eight light-flavoured squarks are always assumed to be mass-degenerate. Figure 18 shows the exclusion limits in simplified models with squark-pair production and subsequent direct squark decays to a quark and the lightest neutralino. The expected limits from the three most sensitive searches (0L, MONOJ and 0LRaz) are presented individually along with the combined expected and observed exclusion limits. The 0L and 0LRaz analyses yield in general higher expected mass limits, but the MONOJ search provides the best sensitivity close to the diagonal line, in the region of parameter space where the mass difference between the squark and the lightest neutralino is small. From the observed limits, neutralino masses below about 280 GeV can be excluded for squark masses -40 -  Figure 18. Exclusion limits in the mass plane of the lightest neutralino and first-and secondgeneration squarks assuming squark-pair production and direct decaysq \u2192 q\u03c7 0 1. The solid red line and the dashed red line show respectively the combined observed and expected 95% CL exclusion limits. Expected limits from the individual analyses which contribute to the final combined limits are also shown for comparison. A previous result from ATLAS [156] using 7 TeV proton-proton collisions is represented by the shaded (grey) area. A limit obtained with the 0L search [20] in a scenario with only one light-flavour squark produced is also presented for completeness.",

            "text": "A search for squarks and gluinos in inclusive final states containing high-p T jets and missing transverse momentum, with or without leptons or b-jets, is presented. The data were recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment with \u221a s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity up to 20.3 fb \u22121 . Earlier ATLAS searches have been extended and combined with new search techniques, thus improving the sensitivity for supersymmetric models. Good agreement is found with the predictions from SM processes. The data are therefore used to set exclusion limits for a variety of simplified and phenomenological SUSY models. Limits in simplified models with gluinos and squarks of the first and second generations are derived for direct and one-or two-step decays of squarks and gluinos, and gluino decays via third-generation squarks. In all the considered simplified models that assume R-parity conservation, the limit on the gluino mass exceeds 1150 GeV at 95% CL, for an LSP mass smaller than 100 GeV. Additional limits are set in a phenomenological MSSM model used in the search for left-handed squarks, a minimal Supergravity/Constrained MSSM model, R-parity-violation scenarios, a minimal gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model, a natural gauge mediation model, a non-universal Higgs mass model with gaugino mediation and a minimal model of universal extra dimensions. These limits are either new or extend the region of parameter space excluded by previous searches with the ATLAS detector.",

In principle, the extension could have been performed up to mass gaps as small as mg \u2212 m\u03c70 1 \u2265 2m b , but it was found that for a 100% branching ratio hypothesis for theg \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 mode, mass gaps smaller than the four-body kinematic bound quickly lead to large gluino lifetimes, resulting in displaced gluino decays. This is verified even in the scenario leading to the smallest gluino lifetime (mt 1 = mg,t 1 =t R ). Since the results of the various searches reported in this paper are all based on prompt objects, the expected sensitivity to these scenarios with small mass gaps is very small, and they are addressed by dedicated searches [157]. Therefore, the probed parameter space is limited to mg \u2212 m\u03c70 1 \u2265 m t + m W + m b . Despite the restriction of the model parameter space to regions where four-body gluino decaysg \u2192 tW b\u03c7 0 1 are always kinematically allowed, more complex decays (mainly fivebody) can occur concurrently with a significant branching ratio, and even become dominant when the mass gap approaches its lower bound. Consideration of these alternative decay modes also sometimes leads to large differences in kinematic distributions of the decay products. For example, the b-quark in the decayg \u2192 tW b\u03c7 , whereas it can still get sizeable momentum in the alternative decayg \u2192 W W bb\u03c7 0 1 . Since the most sensitive searches for this model rely on selections with at least three b-jets, one can see that the acceptance of these selections would vanish at the kinematic bound if considering only four-body decays, although it is not the case thanks to the alternative decay modes. To summarize, quantitative studies showed that it is important to consider at least the five-body decay as well in this region of the parameter space.",

It was first observed that narrow-width approximations for the gluino decay compared poorly to the reference, hence imposing the need for decay amplitudes computed from matrix elements for the four-and five-body decays, and as a consequence the choice of the Madgraph generator. However, the computing requirements to obtain the amplitude associated with such a 2 \u2192 10 (+1) hard process (with an extra parton) are too demanding. An approximation is used instead, consisting in the separate generation of pair-produced gluinos, and gluino decays into fermionsg \u2192 ff f f bb\u03c7 0 1 . The two stages are then combined by boosting the gluino decay products according to the gluino's directions and momenta defined by the hard process, while preserving the gluino spin orientations. The use of the inclusive seven-body gluino decay, instead of the minimally required five-body decay, came at no additional computing cost and allowed, in particular, proper propagation of the various spin correlations along the gluino decay chain. This setup provided agreement with the reference at the level of 5%, for the shapes of various generatorlevel kinematic distributions (a few of which are presented in figure 38), as well as for fiducial acceptances of typical event selections used as signal regions in the relevant SUSY searches.

The analysis described here searches for squarks in final states with high-p T jets, missing transverse momentum and no electrons or muons, using the Razor variable set [19]. These variables provide longitudinal and transverse information about each event, contribute to the rejection of the background from the multi-jet processes that dominate hadronic collisions, and can be used as an approximation of the mass scale of the produced particles.     The basic analysis approach relies on the definition of statistically independent regions in the Razor variable phase space, R and M R , explained in details in the remainder of this section, that are rich in SUSY-like events, and other regions, each dominated by one SM background component. Following the strategy explained in section 6, the Monte Carlo expectations are normalized to the data in each background control region, and those normalization factors are then transferred to the MC prediction in the SUSY signal regions. The baseline object selection and event cleaning, as well as the choice of MC generators for SM background processes and the approach for calculating systematic uncertainties exactly follow those of the 0-lepton + 2-6 jets + E miss T (0L) search [20], and are not discussed here.

This is also the minimum number of visible objects in the final state necessary to construct the Razor variables. Figure 39 shows the values of R and M R for two simplified model signal points, one with mq = 450 GeV and m LSP = 400 GeV, where the \u2206m = 50 GeV is small (referred to as small-\u2206m signal ) and the other with mq = 850 GeV and m LSP = 100 GeV, where the \u2206m = 750 GeV is large (referred to as large-\u2206m signal ), after requiring no leptons and at least two jets in the final state. Since the variable M R is related to the mass difference between the squark and the neutralino, going from the small-\u2206m signal to the large-\u2206m signal , the events tend to populate higher M R regions. Extending this to all points of the model with squark-pair production followed by the direct decay of squarks, the average value of M R is approximately constant for a fixed mass splitting between the LSP and the squark, and increases with increasing \u2206m, while the average R-value tends to be around 0.5.",

For each of these backgrounds a control region, rich in the respective process, is defined. The trigger requirements for these lepton-rich control regions follow those used by the corresponding control regions for the the 0L search [20]. The Razor variables are used to preselect a region which is dominated by the particular process. Following this preselection, to control the tt background, the control region CRT requires at least one jet tagged as a b-jet and exactly one electron or muon, while the W +jets control region, CRW, applies a veto on the presence of b-jets and requires exactly one electron or muon.

The p-value (p(s = 0)) is also presented in the table.",
