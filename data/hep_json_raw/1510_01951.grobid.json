A model-independent description of the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 mass spectrum is obtained, using as input the K\u03c0 mass spectrum and angular distribution derived directly from data, without requiring a theoretical description of resonance shapes or their interference. The hypothesis that the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 mass spectrum can be described in terms of K\u03c0 reflections alone is rejected with more than 8\u03c3 significance. This provides confirmation, in a model-independent way, of the need for an additional resonant component in the mass region of the Z\u00f04430\u00de \u2212 exotic state.",

For many years, significant effort has been devoted to the search for such exotic configurations. In the baryon sector, resonances with a fivequark content have been searched for extensively [2][3][4][5]. Recently, LHCb has observed a resonance in the J=\u03c8p channel, compatible with being a pentaquark-charmonium state [6]. In the meson sector, several charmoniumlike states, that could be interpreted as four-quark states [7,8], have been reported by a number of experiments, but not all of them have been confirmed.",

This state, having a minimum quark content of ccud, is the strongest candidate for a four-quark meson [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. Through a multidimensional amplitude fit, LHCb confirmed the existence of the Z\u00f04430\u00de \u2212 resonance with a significance of 13.9\u03c3, and its mass and width were measured to be M Z \u2212 \u00bc 4475 AE 7 \u00fe15 \u221225 MeV=c 2 and \u0393 Z \u2212 \u00bc 172 AE 13 \u00fe37 \u221234 MeV=c 2 . Spin parity of J P \u00bc 1 \u00fe was favored over the other assignments by more than 17.8\u03c3, and through the study of the variation of the phase of the Z\u00f04430\u00de \u2212 with mass, LHCb demonstrated its resonant character.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [28], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [29] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV=c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV=c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [30]. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [31]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [32], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

This is achieved by comparing the experimental m \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 spectrum to that of a simulated sample which accounts for the measured mass spectrum and the angular distribution of the K\u03c0 system by means of appropriate weights. The comparison is performed in three  configurations of the K\u03c0 spin contributions. The simplest configuration corresponds to including the contributions of S, P, and D waves, which account for all resonances with mass below the kinematic limit and the K \u00c3 \u00f01680\u00de 0 meson, just above it (see Table III). In the second configuration, the K \u00c3 3 \u00f01780\u00de 0 meson is also allowed to contribute. This represents a rather unlikely assumption since it implies a sizeable presence of spin-3 resonances at low m K\u03c0 . This configuration can be considered as an extreme case that provides a valuable test for the robustness of the method. In the third configuration, a more realistic choice is made by limiting the maximum spin as a function of m K\u03c0 .",

In this section, the disagreement is quantified via a hypothesis-testing procedure using a likelihood-ratio estimator. The compatibility between the expected m \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 distribution, accounting for the reflections of the K\u03c0 angular structure, and that observed experimentally is tested for the three l max assignments described in the previous section, with three sets of about 1000 pseudoexperiments each. For each pseudoexperiment, data and simulated samples involved in the analysis chain are reproduced as pseudosamples, generated at the same statistical level as in the real case. The signal candidate pseudosamples are extracted from a \u00f0m K\u03c0 ; cos \u03b8 K \u00c30 ; cos \u03b8 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de ; \u0394\u03d5 K\u03c0;\u03bc\u03bc \u00de distribution obtained by an independent EvtGen [35] phase-space sample of B 0 \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00deK \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 events. The distribution is generated, for each of the three l max cases previously discussed, in order to reproduce the (m K\u03c0 ,cos \u03b8 K \u00c30 ) behavior. The background pseudosamples are simulated according to the \u00f0m K\u03c0 ; cos \u03b8 K \u00c30 ; cos \u03b8 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de ; \u0394\u03d5 K\u03c0;\u03bc\u03bc \u00de distribution of the candidates in the B 0 invariant mass sidebands. Finally, to mimic the calculation of the efficiency correction factors, two additional samples are generated by extracting events from two distributions, in the same 4D space, obtained from the simulation with full detector effects, before and after the application of the analysis chain. The sum of the signal and background samples is then subject to background subtraction and efficiency correction, exactly as for the real data, and moments are calculated. In the pseudoexperiments, events are simulated with equal amounts of each \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de polarization state. Effects related to \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de polarization are only included in the pseudosample via their correlation with the K\u03c0 mass and cos \u03b8 K \u00c30 distributions, which are derived from the data. It has been checked that this does not significantly influence the results although the validity of such approximate treatment of \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de polarization is, in general, analysis dependent and not necessarily appropriate in other experimental situations.",

VII is used for each pseudoexperiment to produce an m \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 probability density function, F l max , for each of the three l max configurations. To test for the presence of possible contributions from the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 dynamics, which are expected to be present in moments of all orders, a fourth configuration is introduced by setting l max to the unphysically large value of 30. By including moments up to l max \u00bc 30, most of the features of the m \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 spectrum in data are well described, as can be seen in Fig. 11.

In the continuous (blue) line, the angular structure of the K\u03c0 system is incorporated using Legendre polynomials with variable index l max according to Eq. (4). The shaded (yellow) bands are related to the uncertainty on normalized moments, which is due to the statistical uncertainty that comes from the data. Therefore, the two uncertainties should not be combined when comparing data and Monte Carlo predictions. See the text for further details.",

An exotic state in the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 system would give contributions to all K\u03c0 Legendre polynomial moments, whereas the conventional K\u03c0 resonances contribute only to moments corresponding to their spin and their interferences. If, for instance, the B 0 \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00deK \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decay proceeds through S, P, and D K\u03c0 resonances, then only moments with l max \u2264 4 would exhibit significant activity. Therefore, activity in moments of order l max > 4 would suggest the presence of other resonant states contributing to the decay. Lower-order K\u03c0 Legendre polynomial moments, determined from data and used to build the prediction, although strongly dominated by the conventional K\u03c0 resonances, could also contain a contribution from the exotic state. As a consequence, a relatively small \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 resonant contribution could be accommodated by the Monte Carlo prediction. Conversely, a significant disagreement would imply that the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 invariant mass spectrum cannot be explained as a reflection of the activity of known resonances in the K\u03c0 system and would therefore constitute strong evidence for the presence of exotic states in the decay",
