The single event sensitivity is 3.15 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , corresponding to 0.267 Standard Model events. One signal candidate is observed while the expected background is 0.152 events. This leads to an upper limit of 14 \u00d7 10 \u221210 on the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio at 95% CL.",

The quadratic GIM mechanism and the small value of the CKM element |V td | describing the transition of a top into a down quark make this process extremely rare. Using tree-level elements of the CKM matrix as external inputs, the SM predicts [1] the branching ratio to be BR = (8.4 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10 \u221211 , where the uncertainty is dominated by the current precision on the CKM parameters. The intrinsic theoretical accuracy is at the 2% level, as the computation includes NLO (NNLO) QCD corrections to the top (charm) quark contribution [2,3] and NLO electroweak corrections [4]. Moreover, the hadronic matrix element largely cancels when normalised to the precisely measured BR of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd decay, with isospin breaking and non-perturbative effects calculated in detail [4,5].",

This technique utilises a high energy beam to boost the kaon decay products to high energy where their detection and identification can be efficient. The boost folds the decay products into a small angular region close to the beam axis allowing for a classic fixed target geometry experiment. The detector should measure the incoming kaon and the outgoing pion while reducing background to the level of 10 \u221211 of accepted kaon decays in the high rate environment necessary to achieve the required sensitivity. To this end, the detector consists of a collection of sub-detectors, each designed to perform one main task, and with complementary performance. The NA62 beam line and detector layout is described in detail in [17] and shown in Fig. 1 together with the scale and reference system: the beam line defines the Z axis with its origin at the kaon production target and beam particles travelling in the positive direction, the Y axis points vertically up, and the X axis is horizontal and directed to form a right-handed coordinate system.",

The L0 trigger requires a signal in RICH to tag a charged particle in coincidence within 10 ns with: a signal in at least one CHOD tile; no signals in opposite CHOD quadrants to reduce K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays; no signals in MUV3 and LAV12 to reduce K + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd and K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays; and LKr energy deposit below 20 GeV to suppress K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays. The L1 trigger requires: a kaon identified in KTAG and signals in at most two blocks of each LAV station, within 10 ns of the L0 trigger RICH time; at least one STRAW track corresponding to a particle with momentum below 50 GeV/c which forms a vertex with the nominal beam axis upstream of the first STRAW chamber. The analysis also uses data taken with a minimum-bias L0 trigger based on NA48-CHOD information downscaled by a factor of 400 (\"control triggers\") to measure efficiencies and estimate backgrounds. Events collected with the PNN (control) trigger are referred to as \"PNN-triggered events\" (\"control events\") in the following.",

Conditions imposed on the m2 miss computed in these alternative ways refine the definition of signal regions, reducing the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd acceptance by a further relative 7% and providing additional background suppression in case of mis-reconstruction in STRAW or GTK. A multivariate classifier based on a Boosted Decision Tree algorithm[22] combines 13 variables describing the energy associated with the \u03c0 + , the shape of the clusters and energy sharing between the calorimeters. Pion identification with the RICH exploits the ratio of likelihoods under the \u03c0 + and \u03bc + hypotheses. Additional constraints are applied on the particle mass calculated from the ring radius computed by the single-ring RICH algorithm and the momentum measured by the STRAW. The \u03c0 + identification efficiency measured in the (15, 35) GeV/c momentum range is 78% (82%) with calorimeters (RICH), and the corresponding probability of \u03bc + mis-identification as \u03c0 + is 0.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). MC simulations reproduce these results with 10-20% accuracy. A requirement of no particle detected in MUV3 within 7 ns of the \u03c0 + reinforces the MUV3 trigger condition. Photon rejection suppresses K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays which can mimic the signal if the two-body kinematics is not well reconstructed. The main requirements are: no energy deposited in any LAV station (IRC and SAC) within 3 (7) ns of the \u03c0 + time; no clusters in the LKr beyond 100 mm from the \u03c0 + impact point location within time windows ranging from \u00b15 ns for cluster energies below 5 GeV to \u00b150 ns above 15 GeV. Multiplicity rejection criteria against photons interacting in the detector material upstream of the LKr include: no in-time activity in the CHOD and NA48-CHOD unrelated to the \u03c0 + but in spatial coincidence with an energy deposit of at least 40 MeV in the LKr; no additional segments reconstructed in the STRAW compatible with the decay vertex; no in-time signals in HASC and MUV0; fewer than four extra signals in the NA48-CHOD in time with the \u03c0 + . The resulting \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 rejection inefficiency is measured to be 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 by counting selected control (PNN-triggered) events in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 region before (after) photon and multiplicity rejection.
