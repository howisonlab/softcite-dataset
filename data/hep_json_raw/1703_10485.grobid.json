The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and pile-up stability.",

The jet calibration procedure should correctly determine the jet energy scale and additionally the best possible energy and angular resolution should be achieved. Good jet reconstruction and calibration facilitates the identification of known resonances that decay to hadronic jets, as well as the search for new particles. A complication, at the high luminosities encountered by the ATLAS detector [2], is that multiple interactions can contribute to the detector signals associated with a single bunch-crossing (pile-up). These interactions, which are mostly soft, have to be separated from the hard interaction that is of interest.",

The vast majority of analyses utilised jets that were built from topological clusters of calorimeter cells (topo-clusters) [3]. These jets were then calibrated to the particle level using a jet energy scale (JES) correction factor [4][5][6][7]. For the final Run 1 jet calibration, this correction factor also took into account the tracks associated with the jet, as this was found to greatly improve the jet resolution [4]. 'Particle flow' introduces an alternative approach, in which measurements from both the tracker and the calorimeter are combined to form the signals, which ideally represent individual particles. The energy deposited in the calorimeter by all the charged particles is removed. Jet reconstruction is then performed on an ensemble of 'particle flow objects' consisting of the remaining calorimeter energy and tracks which are matched to the hard interaction.",

By using the track's azimuthal coordinate 1 at the perigee, these particles are clustered into the jet. \u2022 When a track is reconstructed, one can ascertain whether it is associated with a vertex, and if so the vertex from which it originates. Therefore, in the presence of multiple in-time pile-up interactions, the effect of additional particles on the hard-scatter interaction signal can be mitigated by rejecting signals originating from pile-up vertices. 2 The capabilities of the tracker in reconstructing charged particles are complemented by the calorimeter's ability to reconstruct both the charged and neutral particles. At high energies, the calorimeter's energy resolution is superior to the tracker's momentum resolution. Thus a combination of the two subsystems is preferred for optimal event reconstruction. Outside the geometrical acceptance of the tracker, only the calorimeter information is available. Hence, in the forward region the topo-clusters alone are used as inputs to the particle flow jet reconstruction. However, particle flow introduces a complication. For any particle whose track measurement ought to be used, it is necessary to correctly identify its signal in the calorimeter, to avoid double-counting its energy in the reconstruction. In the particle flow algorithm described herein, a Boolean decision is made as to whether to use the tracker or calorimeter measurement. If a particle's track measurement is to be used, the corresponding energy must be subtracted from the calorimeter measurement. The ability to accurately subtract all of a single particle's energy, without removing any energy deposited by any other particle, forms the key performance criterion upon which the algorithm is optimised.",

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

In the CMS experiment at the LHC, large gains in the performance of the reconstruction of hadronic jets and \u03c4 leptons have been seen from the use of particle flow algorithms [18][19][20].

The same LAr technology is used in the calorimeter endcaps, with fine granularity and lead absorbers for the EM endcap (EMEC), while the hadronic endcap (HEC) utilises copper absorbers with reduced granularity. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules (FCal) optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements respectively.

The presampler consists of an active LAr layer of thickness 1.1 cm (0.5 cm) in the barrel (endcap) region. The granularity of all the calorimeter layers within the tracker acceptance is given in Table 1. The EM calorimeter is over 22 radiation lengths in depth, ensuring that there is little leakage of EM showers into the hadronic calorimeter. The total depth of the complete calorimeter is over 9 interaction lengths in the barrel and over 10 interaction lengths in the endcap, such that good containment of hadronic showers is obtained. Signals in the MS are used to correct the jet energy if the hadronic shower is not completely contained. In both the EM and Tile calorimeters, most of the absorber material is in the second layer.

Tracking and calorimetric information is combined for the reconstruction of hadronic jets and soft activity (additional hadronic recoil below the threshold used in jet reconstruction) in the event. The reconstruction of the soft activity is important for the calculation of the missing transverse momentum in the event [53], whose magnitude is denoted by E miss T . The particle flow algorithm provides a list of tracks and a list of topo-clusters containing both the unmodified topoclusters and a set of new topo-clusters resulting from the energy subtraction procedure. This algorithm is sketched in Fig. 2. First, well-measured tracks are selected following the criteria discussed in Sect. 6.2. The algorithm then attempts to match each track to a single topo-cluster in the calorimeter (Sect. 6.3). The expected energy in the calorimeter, deposited by the particle that also created the track, is computed based on the topo-cluster position and the track momentum (Sect. 6.4). It is relatively common for a single particle to deposit energy in multiple topo-clusters. For each track/topo-cluster system, the algorithm evaluates the probability that the particle energy was deposited in more than one topo-cluster. On this basis it decides if it is necessary to add more topo-clusters to the track/topo-cluster system to recover the full shower energy (Sect. 6.5). The Fig. 2 A flow chart of how the particle flow algorithm proceeds, starting with track selection and continuing until the energy associated with the selected tracks has been removed from the calorimeter. At the end, charged particles, topo-clusters which have not been modified by the algorithm, and remnants of topo-clusters which have had part of their energy removed remain expected energy deposited in the calorimeter by the particle that produced the track is subtracted cell by cell from the set of matched topo-clusters (Sect. 6.6). Finally, if the remaining energy in the system is consistent with the expected shower fluctuations of a single particle's signal, the topo-cluster remnants are removed (Sect. 6.7).",

The samples used for the validation are single-pion and dijet MC samples without pile-up, as described in the previous section. Charged pions dominate the charged component of the jet, which on average makes up two-thirds of the visible jet energy [54,55]. Another quarter of the jet energy is contributed by photons from neutral hadron decays, and the remainder is carried by neutral hadrons that reach the calorimeter. Because the majority of tracks are generated by charged pions [56], particularly at low p T , the pion mass hypothesis is assumed for all tracks used by the particle flow algorithm to reconstruct jets. Likewise the energy subtraction is based on the calorimeter's response to charged pions.",

The distribution of E clus / p trk for the topocluster with at least 90% of the true energy from the particle matched to the track -the \"correct\" one to match to -and for the closest other topo-cluster in R is shown in Fig. 11. For very soft particles, it is common that the closest other topocluster carries E clus / p trk comparable to (although smaller than) the correct topo-cluster. About 10% of incorrect topoclusters are rejected by the E clus / p trk cut for particles with 1 < p T < 2 GeV. The difference in E clus / p trk becomes much more pronounced for particles with p T > 5 GeV, for which there is a very clear separation between the cor- rect and incorrect topo-cluster matches, resulting in a 30-40% rejection rate for the incorrect topo-clusters. This is because at lower p T clusters come from both signal and electronic or pile-up noise. Furthermore, the particle p T spectrum is peaked towards lower values, and thus higherp T topo-clusters are rarer. The E clus / p trk > 0.1 requirement rejects the correct cluster for far less than 1% of particles. Next, an attempt is made to match the track to one of the preselected topo-clusters using the distance metric R defined in Eq. 5. The distribution of R between the track and the topo-cluster with > 90% of the truth particle energy and to the closest other preselected topo-cluster is shown in Fig. 12 for the dijet MC sample. From this figure, it is seen that the correct topo-cluster almost always lies at a small R relative to other clusters. Hence, the closest preselected topo-cluster in R is taken to be the matched topocluster. This criterion selects the correct topo-cluster with a high probability, succeeding for virtually all particles with p T > 5 GeV. If no preselected topo-cluster is found in a cone of size R = 1.64, it is assumed that this particle did not form a topo-cluster in the calorimeter. In such cases the track is retained in the list of tracks and no subtraction is performed. The numerical value corresponds to a one-sided Gaussian confidence interval of 95%, and has not been optimised. However, as seen in Fig. 12, this cone size almost always includes the correct topo-cluster, while rejecting the bulk of incorrect clusters.",

If E dep exceeds the total energy of the set of matched topo-clusters, Starting from the extrapolated track position in the LHED, a parameterised shower shape is used to map out the most likely energy density profile in each layer. This profile is determined from a single \u03c0 \u00b1 MC sample and is dependent on the track momentum and pseudorapidity, as well as on the LHED for the set of considered topo-clusters. Rings are formed in \u03b7-\u03c6 space around the extrapolated track. The rings are just wide enough to always contain at least one calorimeter cell, independently of the extrapolated position, and are confined to a single calorimeter layer. Rings within a single layer are equally spaced in radius. The average energy density in each ring is then computed, and the rings are ranked in descending order of energy density, irrespective of which layer each ring is in. Subtraction starts from the ring with the highest energy density (the innermost ring of the LHED) and proceeds successively to the lower-density rings. If the energy in the cells in the current ring is less than the remaining energy required to reach E dep , these cells are simply removed and the energy still to be subtracted is reduced by the total energy of the ring. If instead the ring has more energy than is still to be removed, each cell in the ring is scaled down in energy by the fraction needed to reach the expected energy from the particle, then the process halts. Figure 15 shows a cartoon of how this subtraction works, removing cells in different rings from different layers until the expected energy deposit is reached. therefore originates purely from shower fluctuations and so the energy in the remaining cells is removed. Conversely, if the remaining energy is above this threshold, the remnant topo-cluster(s) are retained -it being likely that multiple particles deposited energy in the vicinity.

The effectiveness of the recovery can be judged based on whether the procedure is correctly triggered, and on the extent to which the energy subtraction is improved by its execution. Figure 18 shows the fraction \u03b5 clus matched of the true deposited energy contained within the matched topo-cluster, separately for cases where the split shower recovery procedure is and is not triggered, as determined by the criteria described in Sect. 6.5. In the cases where the split shower recovery procedure is not run, \u03b5 clus matched is found to be high, confirming that the comparison of topo-cluster energy and E clus ref / p trk ref is successfully identifying good topo-cluster matches. Conversely, the split shower recovery procedure is activated when \u03b5 clus matched is low, particularly for higherp T particles, which are expected to split their energy between multiple topo-clusters more often. Furthermore, as the particle p T rises, the width of the calorimeter response distribution decreases, making it easier to distinguish the different cases. Figure 19 shows the fraction f clus sub of the true deposited energy of the pions considered for subtraction, in the set of clusters matched to the track, as a function of true p T . For particles with p T > 20 GeV, with split shower recovery active, f clus sub is greater than 90% on average. The subtraction algorithm misses more energy for softer showers, which are  Fig. 19 The fraction of the true energy of a given particle considered in the subtraction procedure f clus sub after the inclusion of the split shower recovery algorithm. The data are taken from a dijet sample without pileup with 20 < p lead T < 500 GeV and the statistical uncertainties on the number of MC simulated events are shown as a hatched band harder to capture completely. While f clus sub could be increased by simply attempting recovery more frequently, expanding the topo-cluster matching procedure in this fashion increases the risk of incorrectly subtracting neutral energy; hence the split shower recovery procedure cannot be applied indiscriminately. The settings used in the studies presented in this paper are a reasonable compromise between these two cases.",

Figure 22 illustrates the action of the algorithm in the second layer of the EM calorimeter, where the majority of low-energy showers are contained. The focus is on a region where a 30 GeV truth jet is present. In general, the subtraction works well in the absence of pile-up, as the two topo-clusters inside the jet radius with energy mainly associated with charged particles at truth level are entirely removed. Nevertheless, examples can be seen where small mistakes are made. For example, the algorithm additionally removes some cells containing neutral-particle energy from the topo-cluster just above the track at (\u03b7, \u03c6) = (0.0, 1.8). The figure also shows the same event, overlaid with pile-up corresponding to \u03bc = 40. Pile-up contributions are identified by subtracting the energy reconstructed without pile-up and are illustrated in blue. The pile-up supplies many more energy deposits and tracks within the region under scrutiny. However, the subtraction continues to function effectively, removing energy in the vicinity of pile-up tracks and hence the post-subtraction cell distribution more closely resembles that without pile-up, especially inside the jet radius.  Because tracks classified as originating from pile-up are ignored in jet reconstruction (see Sect. 8), the jet energy after subtraction is mainly contaminated by neutral pile-up contributions.",

As discussed above, the tracks associated to pile-up vertices are omitted, eliminating a large fraction of the energy deposits from charged particles from pile-up interactions. The jet-area subtraction therefore corrects for the impact of charged underlyingevent hadrons, charged particles from out-of-time interactions, and more importantly, neutral particles from pile-up interactions. This correction is evaluated prior to calibration of the jet energy scale. Figure 23 shows the distribution of the median transverse energy density \u03c1 in dijet MC events for particle flow objects and for topo-clusters. The topo-cluster \u03c1 is calculated with the ensemble of clusters, calibrated either at the EM scale or LC scale, and the particle flow jets use topo-clusters calibrated at the EM scale. The LC-scale energy density is larger than the EM-scale energy density due to the application of the cell weights to calibrate cells to the hadronic scale. Compared to the EMand LC-scale energy densities, \u03c1 has a lower per-event value for particle flow jets in 2012 conditions, due to the reduced pile-up contribution. The removal of the charged particle flow objects that are not associated with the hard-scatter primary vertex more than compensates for the higher energy scale for charged hadrons from the underlying event. Figure 24 shows the energy response R = E reco /E truth prior to the MC-based jet energy scale correction. The same numerical procedure as described in Ref. [6] is applied and successfully corrects for the hadron response, at a similar level to that observed in Ref. [6].

A global sequential correction [4] that makes use of additional observables adapts the jet energy calibration to account for such variations, thereby improving the jet resolution without changing the scale.

The mean value is determined using a Gaussian fit to the distribution in bins of the Z -boson p T . The double-ratio of data to MC simulation is also shown. The simulation reproduces the data to within 2%, and in general is consistent with the data points within statistical uncertainties. At high p T the data/MC ratio is expected to tend towards that of the calorimeter jets [6,7], as a large fraction of the jet's energy is carried by particles above the cut made on the track momentum. For p T > 200 GeV it is observed that the jet energy scale of calorimeter jets in data is typically 0.5% below that in simulation. Simulated pile-up conditions are similar to the data-taking in 2012.

Particle flow jets are calibrated using the procedures described in Sect. 8, while calorimeter jets use the more detailed procedure described in Refs. [4][5][6][7]. The particle flow jets perform better than calorimeter jets at transverse momenta of up to 90 GeV in the central region, benefiting from the improved scale for lowp T hadrons and intrinsic pile-up suppression (elaborated on in Sect. 10). However, at high transverse momenta, the particle flow reconstruction performs slightly worse than the standard reconstruction. This is due to two effects. The dense core of a jet poses a challenge to tracking algorithms, causing the tracking efficiency and accuracy to degrade in highp T jets. Furthermore, the close proximity of the showers within the jet increases the degree of confusion during the cell subtraction stage. To counteract this, the track p T used for particle flow reconstruction is required to be < 40 GeV for the 2012 data. Alternative solutions, such as smoothly disabling the algorithm for individual tracks as the particle environment becomes more dense, are expected to restore the particle flow jet performance to match that of the calorimeter jets at high energies. The benefits of particle flow also diminish toward the more forward regions as the cell granularity decreases, as shown in Fig. 26b.",

This is due to three different effects. Firstly, usage of tracks to measure charged particles results in a much better angular resolution for individual particles than that obtained using topo-clusters, because the tracker's angular resolution  is far superior to that of the calorimeter. Secondly, the track four-momentum can be determined at the perigee, before the charged particles have been spread out by the magnetic field, thereby improving the \u03c6 resolution for the jet. Thirdly, the suppression of charged pile-up particles should also reduce mismeasurements of the jet direction. Figure 28 shows the angular resolution in \u03b7 and \u03c6 as a function of the reconstructed jet transverse momentum for particle flow and calorimeter jets. It is determined from the standard deviation of a Gaussian fit over \u00b11.5\u03c3 to the difference between the \u03b7 and \u03c6 values for the reconstructed and matched truth ( R < 0.3) jets in the central region. At low p T , where the three effects described above are expected to be more important, significant improvements are seen in both the \u03b7 and \u03c6 resolutions. It is interesting to note that for par-ticle flow jets the \u03b7 and \u03c6 resolutions are similar, while for calorimeter jets the \u03c6 resolution is worse due to the aforementioned effect of the magnetic field on charged particles.",

Figure 29a shows the fake-jet rate as a function of the jet \u03b7 for particle flow jets compared to calorimeter jets with and without track-based pileup suppression [65]. These rates are evaluated using a dijet MC sample overlaid with simulated minimum-bias events approximating the data-taking conditions in 2012. The jet vertex fraction (JVF) is defined as the ratio of two scalar sums of track momenta: the numerator is the scalar sum of the p T of tracks that originate from the hard-scatter primary vertex and are associated with the jet; the denominator is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks associated with that jet. 4 Within the tracker coverage of |\u03b7| < 2.5, the fake rate for particle flow jets drops by an order of magnitude compared to the standard calorimeter jets. The small increase in the rate of particle flow fake jets around 1.0 < |\u03b7| < 1.2 is related to the worse performance of the particle flow algorithm in the transition region between the barrel and extended barrel of the Tile calorimeter, which is significantly affected by pile-up contributions [3]. 4 Jets with no tracks associated with them are assigned JVF = \u22121.",

A preselection is made using the criteria described in Sect. 4. The particle flow algorithm is run on these events and further requirements are applied: events are selected with two isolated muons, each with p T > 25 GeV, with invariant mass 80 < m \u03bc\u03bc < 100 GeV and p \u03bc\u03bc T > 32 GeV, ensuring that the boson recoils against hadronic activity. Figure 30 displays two regions of phase space: one opposite the recoiling boson, where large amounts of hard-scatter jet activity are expected, and one off-axis, which is more sensitive to pile-up jet activity. Figure 31 shows the average number of jets with p T > 20 GeV in the hard-scatter-enriched region for different |\u03b7| ranges as a function of the number of primary vertices. The distributions are stable for particle flow jets and for calorimeter jets with |JVF| > 0.25 as a function the number of primary vertices in all |\u03b7| regions. The only exception is in the Fig. 30 A diagram displaying the regions of r -\u03c6 phase space which are expected to be dominated by hard-scatter jets (opposite in the r -\u03c6 plane to the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decay) and where there is greater sensitivity to pile-up jet activity (perpendicular to the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decay) 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.5 region, where in Fig. 29 a slight increase in the jet fake rate is visible for jet pseudorapidities very close to the tracker boundary. This is due to the jet area collecting charged-particle pile-up contributions that are outside the ID acceptance. If the JVF cut is not applied to the calorimeter jets, the jet multiplicity grows with increasing pile-up. Figure 32 shows that in the pile-up-enriched selection, the particle flow and calorimeter jets with a JVF selection still show no dependence on the number of reconstructed vertices in all |\u03b7| regions. The observed difference between data and MC simulation for both jet collections is due to a poor modelling of this region of phase space. These distributions establish the high stability of particle flow jets in varying pile-up conditions.",

The quadratic difference in the resolution with and without pile-up is shown in the lower panel for LC + JES (blue) and particle flow (black) jets. The data are taken from dijet samples, with and without pileup, with 20 < p lead T < 500 GeV and the statistical uncertainties on the number of MC simulated events are shown measurements due to pile-up contributions. This is demonstrated by Fig. 33, which compares the jet energy resolution for particle flow and calorimeter jets with and without pileup. Even in the absence of pile-up, the particle flow jets have a better resolution at p T values below 50 GeV. With pile-up conditions similar to those in the 2012 data, the cross-over point is at p T = 90 GeV, indicating that particle flow reconstruction alleviates a significant contribution from pile-up even for fairly energetic jets. The direct effect of pile-up can be seen in the lower panel, where the difference in quadrature between the resolutions with and without pile-up is shown. The origin of the increase in the resolution with pile-up is discussed in detail in Ref. [6]. It is shown that additional energy deposits are the primary cause of the degradation of the calorimeter jet resolution. This effect is mitigated by the particle flow algorithm in two ways. Firstly, the subtraction of topo-clusters formed by charged particles from pileup vertices prior to jet-finding eliminates a major source of fluctuations. Secondly, the increase in the constituent scale of hard-scatter jets from the use of calibrated tracks, rather than energy clusters in the calorimeter, amplifies the signal, effectively suppressing the contribution from pile-up. This second mechanism is found to be the main contributing factor.",

The darker shaded bands represent the statistical uncertainties a 95% pure sample of tt events. The event E miss T is reconstructed from the vector sum of the calibrated jets with p T > 20 GeV, the muon and all remaining tracks associated with the hard-scatter primary vertex but not associated with these objects. This is then used to form the transverse mass variable defined by m T = 2 p \u03bc T E miss T (1 \u2212 cos( \u03c6(\u03bc, E miss T ))). The invariant mass of the two leading non-b-tagged jets, m jj , forms a hadronic W candidate, while the invariant masses of each of the two b-tagged jets and these two non-b-tagged jets form two hadronic top quark candidates, m jjb . Figure 36 compares the data with MC simulation for these three variables; m T , m jj and m jjb . The MC simulation describes the data very well in all three distributions. Figure 37 shows the m jj distribution for particle flow jets compared to the distribution obtained from the same selection applied to calorimeter jets (with |JVF| > is reconstructed from the muon, jets, photons and remaining unassociated clusters [53]. The two selections are applied separately; hence the exact numbers of events in the plots differ. The particle flow reconstruction provides a good measure and narrower width of the peak for both low and high p jj T . Gaussian fits to the data in the range 65 < m jj < 95 GeV give widths of (13.8 \u00b1 0.4) GeV and (16.2 \u00b1 0.6) GeV for particle flow reconstruction and that based on calorimeter jets, respectively, for p jj T < 80 GeV. For p jj T > 80 GeV, the widths were found to be (11.2 \u00b1 0.2) GeV and (11.9 \u00b1 0.3) GeV, respectively. At very high values of p W T , the gains would further diminish (see Fig. 26).",

Jet angular resolutions are improved across the entire p T spectrum, with \u03c3 (\u03b7) and \u03c3 (\u03c6) decreasing from 0.03 to 0.02 and 0.05 to 0.02, respectively, for a jet p T of 30 GeV. Rejection of charged particles from pile-up interactions in jet reconstruction leads to substantially better jet resolution and to the suppression of jets due to pile-up interactions by an order of magnitude within the tracker acceptance, with negligible inefficiency for jets from the hard-scatter interaction. This outperforms a purely track-based jet pile-up discriminant typically used in ATLAS analyses, which achieves similar pile-up suppression at the cost of about one percent in hard-scatter jet efficiency.",
