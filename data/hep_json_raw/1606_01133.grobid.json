The particles are required to have a transverse momentum greater than 100 MeV and an absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on multiplicity are measured in events containing at least two charged particles satisfying the above kinematic criteria.

In this region, charged-particle interactions are typically described by QCD-inspired models implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. Measurements are used to constrain the free parameters of these models. An accurate description of low-energy strong interaction processes is essential for simulating single pp interactions and the effects of multiple pp interactions in the same bunch crossing at high instantaneous luminosity in hadron colliders. Charged-particle distributions have been measured previously in hadronic collisions at various centre-of-mass energies [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].",

The data were recorded during special fills with low beam currents and reduced focusing to give a mean number of interactions per bunch crossing of 0.005. The same dataset and a similar analysis strategy were used to measure distributions of charged particles with transverse momentum p T greater than 500 MeV [9]. This paper extends the measurements to the lowp T regime of p T > 100 MeV. While this nearly doubles the overall number of particles in the kinematic acceptance, the measurements are rendered more difficult due to multiple scattering and imprecise knowledge of the material in the detector. Measurements in the lowmomentum regime provide important information for the description of the strong interaction in the low-momentumtransfer, non-perturbative region of QCD.",

PYTHIA 8 and EPOS both model the effects of colour coherence, which is important in dense parton environments and effectively reduces the number of particles produced in multiple partonparton interactions. In PYTHIA 8, the simulation is split into non-diffractive and diffractive processes, the former dominated by t-channel gluon exchange and amounting to approximately 80 % of the selected events, and the latter described by a pomeron-based approach [17]. In contrast, EPOS implements a parton-based Gribov-Regge [18] theory, an effective field theory describing both hard and soft scattering at the same time. QGSJET-II is based upon the Reggeon field theory framework [19]. The latter two generators do not rely on parton distribution functions (PDFs), as used in PYTHIA 8. Different parameter settings in the models are used in the simulation to reproduce existing experimental data and are referred to as tunes. For PYTHIA 8, the A2 [20] tune is based on the MSTW2008LO PDF [21] while the MONASH [22] underlying-event tune uses the NNPDF2.3LO PDF [23] and incorporates updated fragmentation parameters, as well as SPS and Tevatron data to constrain the energy scaling. For EPOS, the LHC [24] tune is used, while for QGSJET-II the default settings of the generator are applied. Details of the MC generator versions and settings are shown in Table 1. Detector effects are simulated using the GEANT4-based [25] ATLAS simulation framework [26].",

The purity is defined as the fraction of selected tracks that are also primary tracks with a transverse momentum of at least 100 MeV and an absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5. The most critical change with respect to the 500 MeV analysis [9], besides lowering the p T threshold to 100 MeV, is reducing the requirement on the minimum number of silicon hits from 7 to 5. All tracks, irrespective of their transverse momentum, are reconstructed in a single pass of the track reconstruction algorithm.

Figure 1 shows the comparison between data and simulation in the distribution of the number of pixel hits associated with a track for the low-momentum region. Data and simulation agree reasonably well given the known imperfections in the simulation of inactive pixel modules. These differences are taken into account in the systematic uncertainty on the tracking efficiency by comparing the efficiency of the pixel hit requirements in data and simulation after applying all other track selection requirements.

The distribution is shown before the requirement on the number of pixel hits is applied, for tracks with 100 < p T < 500 MeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The error bars on the points are the statistical uncertainties of the data. The lower panel shows the ratio of data to MC prediction Events are required to contain at least two selected tracks satisfying the following criteria: p T > 100 MeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5; at least one pixel hit and an innermost pixellayer hit if expected; 2 at least two, four or six SCT hits for p T < 300 MeV, <400 MeV or >400 MeV respectively, in order to account for the dependence of track length on p T ; |d BL 0 | < 1.5 mm, where the transverse impact parameter d BL 0 is calculated with respect to the measured beam line (BL); and |z BL 0 \u00d7 sin \u03b8 | < 1.5 mm, where z BL 0 is the difference between the longitudinal position of the track along the beam line at the point where d BL 0 is measured and the longitudinal position of the primary vertex and \u03b8 is the polar angle of the track. High-momentum tracks with mismeasured p T are removed by requiring the track-fit \u03c7 2 probability to be larger than 0.01 for tracks with p T > 10 GeV.

Charged strange baryons with a mean lifetime 30 < \u03c4 < 300 ps are treated as background, because these particles and their decay products have a very low reconstruction efficiency. Their contribution is estimated from EPOS, where the best description of this strange baryon contribution is expected [9], to be below 0.01 % on average, with the fraction increasing with track p T to be (3 \u00b1 1) % above 20 GeV. The fraction is much smaller at low p T due to the extremely low track reconstruction efficiency. The contribution from secondary particles is estimated by performing a template fit to the distribution of the track transverse impact parameter d BL 0 , using templates for primary and secondary particles created from PYTHIA 8 A2 simulation. All selection requirements are applied except that on the transverse impact parameter. The shape of the transverse impact parameter distribution differs for electron and non-electron secondary particles, as the d BL 0 reflects the radial location at which the secondaries were produced. The processes for conversions and hadronic interactions are rather different, which leads to differences in the radial distributions. The electrons are more often produced from conversions in the beam pipe. Furthermore, the fraction of electrons increases as p T decreases. Therefore, separate Data/MC 1 1.5",

The d BL 0 distribution is shown for 100 < p T < 150 MeV without applying the cut on the transverse impact parameter.

The simulated d BL 0 distribution is normalised to the number of tracks in data and the separate contributions from primary, fake, electron and non-electron tracks are shown as lines using various combinations of dots and dashes.

The lower panel shows the ratio of data to MC prediction templates are used for electrons and non-electron secondary particles in the region p T < 500 MeV. The rate of secondary tracks is the sum of these two contributions and is measured with the fit. The background normalisation for fake tracks and strange baryons is determined from the prediction of the simulation. The fit is performed in nine p T intervals, each of width 50 MeV, in the region 4 < |d BL 0 | < 9.5 mm. The fitted distribution for 100 < p T < 150 MeV is shown in Fig. 2. For this p T interval, the fraction of secondary tracks within the region |d BL 0 | < 1.5 mm is measured to be (3.6 \u00b1 0.7) %, equally distributed between electrons and non-electrons. For tracks with p T > 500 MeV, the fraction of secondary particles is measured to be (2.3 \u00b1 0.6) %; these are mostly nonelectron secondary particles. The uncertainties are evaluated by using different generators to estimate the interpolation from the fit region to |d BL 0 | < 1.5 mm, changing the fit range and checking the \u03b7 dependence of the fraction of tracks originating from secondaries. This last study is performed by fits integrated over different \u03b7 ranges, because the \u03b7 dependence could be different in data and simulation, as most of the secondary particles are produced in the material of the detector. The systematic uncertainties arising from imperfect knowledge of the passive material in the detector are also included; these are estimated using the same material variations as used in the estimation of the uncertainty on the tracking efficiency, described in Sect. 3.4.",

It increases towards higher n ch , as modelled by a colour reconnection  Fig. 4 Primary charged-particle multiplicities as a function of a pseudorapidity \u03b7 and b transverse momentum p T , c the primary chargedparticle multiplicity n ch and d the mean transverse momentum p T versus n ch for events with at least two primary charged particles with p T > 100 MeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, each with a lifetime \u03c4 > 300 ps. The black dots represent the data and the coloured curves the different MC model predictions. The vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainties, while the shaded areas show statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The lower panel in each figure shows the ratio of the MC simulation to data. As the bin centroid is different for data and simulation, the values of the ratio correspond to the averages of the bin content mechanism in PYTHIA 8 and by the hydrodynamical evolution model in EPOS. The QGSJET-II generator, which has no model for colour coherence effects, describes the data poorly. For low n ch , PYTHIA 8 A2 and EPOS underestimate the data, where PYTHIA 8 MONASH agrees within the uncertainties. For higher n ch all generators overestimate the data, but for n ch > 40, there is a constant offset for both PYTHIA 8 tunes, which describe the data to within 10 %. EPOS describes the data reasonably well and to within 2 %. The mean number of primary charged particles per unit pseudorapidity in the central \u03b7 region is measured to be 6.422 \u00b1 0.096, by averaging over |\u03b7| < 0.2; the quoted error is the systematic uncertainty, the statistical uncertainty is negligible. In order to compare with other measurements, it is corrected for the contribution from strange baryons (and therefore extrapolated to primary charged particles with \u03c4 > 30 ps) by a correction factor of 1.0121 \u00b1 0.0035. The central value is taken from EPOS; the systematic uncertainty is taken from the difference between EPOS and PYTHIA 8 A2 (the largest difference was observed between EPOS and PYTHIA 8 A2) and the statistical uncertainty is negligible. The mean number of primary charged particles after the correction is 6.500 \u00b1 0.099. This result is compared to previous measurements [1,2,9] at different \u221a s values in Fig. 5. The predictions from EPOS and PYTHIA 8 MONASH match the data well. For PYTHIA 8 A2, the match is not as good as was observed when measuring particles with p T > 500 MeV [9].",

            "text": "Primary charged-particle multiplicity measurements with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV are presented for events with at least two primary charged particles with |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 100 MeV using a specialised track reconstruction algorithm. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 151 \u00b5b \u22121 is analysed. The mean number of charged particles per unit pseudorapidity in the region |\u03b7| < 0.2 is measured to be 6.422 \u00b1 0.096 with a negligible statistical uncertainty. Significant differences are observed between the measured distributions and the Monte Carlo predictions tested. Amongst the models considered, EPOS has the best overall description of the data as was seen in a previous ATLAS measurement at \u221a s = 13 TeV using tracks with p T > 500 MeV. PYTHIA 8 A2 and PYTHIA 8 MONASH provide a reasonable overall description, whereas QGSJET-II does not describe p T vs. n ch well but provides a reasonable level of agreement for other distributions.
