The data presented here are mid-rapidity jets in the transverse momentum range of 5 < pT < 35 GeV/c and come from polarized proton-proton collisions at center of mass energies of \u221a s = 200 GeV. We compare our measured ALL values to predictions derived from various parameterizations of the polarized gluon distribution function. The results are shown to provide significant constraints for allowable gluon parameterizations within the measurement's kinematic Bjorken-x range of 0.03 < x < 0.3.",

For both samples, the leading systematic uncertainty comes from the trigger and jet reconstruction biases. Differences between observed and true jet p T are estimated using PYTHIA [6] and GEANT[7] simulations and result in corrections being applied to the jet p T values in Figs. 1 and 2. Additionally, the trigger conditions at STAR can artificially bias our sample towards particular flavors of partonic collisions. A conservative systematic is evaluated to account for this effect which incorporates all the allowable \u2206G models. The method applied here is discussed in more detail in [3]. Other less significant systematic uncertainties are also estimated, including relative luminosity uncertainties, beam background event inclusion, and residual transverse beam components.",

            "text": "The A LL curves in Fig. 1 are derived from NLO fits to world polarized DIS data by two separate theory groups, GRSV [8] and GS [9]. Within the GRSV framework, the best fit to available pDIS is STD while \u2206g =g, \u2206g = 0, and \u2206g =-g are fits determined by varying the gluon polarization at the initial scale Q 2 = 0.4 GeV 2 . GS-C is also shown and stands apart from the others in that it contains a node at x \u223c 0.1 for Q 2 = 4 GeV 2 and has a small net contribution within the x-range of the measurement. STAR's x-range, 0.03 < x < 0.3, accounts for \u223c 50% of the total \u2206G integral for GRSV-STD. Figure 2 shows the confidence level (CL) for the comparison of the 2005/6 data and theory for each of the GRSV parameterizations. Stratmann and Vogelsang [10] provided STAR with additional \u2206G models lying between the 4 major GRSV models plotted on the left. In Fig. 1, CLs are calculated for GRSV and GS and all other available global analyses. Models with large positive or negative gluon contributions within STAR's xrange are particularly constrained. Preliminary 2006 and final 2005 inclusive jet A LL results from STAR have been presented. The 2005(6) data represent 2(4.7) pb \u22121 of data with typical beam polarizations around 50(\u223c 55 \u2212 60)%. A confidence level analysis has been shown which constrains the allowable theoretical gluon parameterizations. A recent global analysis has been performed by the DSSV [11] theory group that has included for the first time RHIC pp data with pDIS and pSIDIS data in their NLO fit. The resulting fit constrains the gluon spin contribution to be small in the accessible experimental kinematic range, and contains a node near x \u223c 0.1 with a functional form opposite in sign to that of GS-C's. STAR's preliminary 2006 jets measurement was used in their analysis and provides the leading constraint on negative \u2206g(x) over the range 0.05 < x < 0.2, and comparable constraints to other measurements for positive \u2206g(x) models.",
