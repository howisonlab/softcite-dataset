Studies of triboson production can test the non-Abelian gauge structure of the SM theory and any deviations from the SM prediction would provide hints of new physics at higher energy scales [1][2][3][4].

To search for the W W Z and W Z Z (denoted as W V Z) processes, events with three or four leptons resulting from W V Z \u2192 \u03bdqq , W W Z \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd , and W Z Z \u2192 qq are used. Selection criteria are chosen in order to ensure there is no overlap between different channels. A discriminant that separates the W W W or W V Z signal from the background is defined in each channel. The discriminants are combined using a binned maximum-likelihood fit, which allows the signal yield and the background normalisations to be extracted. The combined observable is the signal strength parameter \u03bc defined as the ratio of the measured W V V cross section to its SM expectation, where one common ratio is assumed for W W W and W V Z.

Additionally, they have to fail the nominal muon definition. Simulation shows that the tt process is the dominant contributor of events with fake leptons, with more than 90% in the \u03bd \u03bdqq channel and more than 95% in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel originating from this process.

The fake factor is the ratio of the number of non-prompt leptons passing the nominal lepton criteria over the number passing the fake lepton criteria. Its value is derived from two tt-enriched regions selected with two or three leptons (no SFOS lepton pairs) and exactly one b-jet.

The following prior uncertainties in the normalisations are assumed: 20% for W Z and Z Z ; 40% for Z +jets, 10% [65] for W t Z , 30% [66,67] for t Z , 11% [68] for tt Z , and 30% for V H not producing three massive bosons. For dominant backgrounds from the W Z and Z Z processes, the simultaneous fit model has the power to constrain their normalisations at the \u223c5% level, independently of the assumed prior. In addition, shape-only variations for backgrounds from the W Z and Z Z processes are derived from alternative samples, generated using Powheg [69] with Pythia 8 for the parton shower to account for differences in the modelling of diboson production and showering. Shape variations due to renormalisation and factorisation scales are also considered for these two processes. The prior uncertainties assumed for Z +jets and V H cover the observed data/simulation agreement in validation regions, and the calculations in Ref. [68], respectively. The impact of these uncertainties on the measurement is small.",

Table 3 Post-fit background, signal and observed yields for the three-lepton and four-lepton channels as well as the tt Z control region. Uncertainties in the predictions include both statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature; correlations among systematic uncertainties are taken into account in the calculation of the total. misidentification rate, lepton fake factor, and photon-like electron scale factor. Additional uncertainties come from the statistical uncertainties in the subsamples used to extrapolate the background evaluations to the signal region. Nuisance parameters are treated as correlated for backgrounds evaluated using the same method and from the same systematic sources. Shape-only variations of the signal distributions due to QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales, PDF, and parton-shower matching scales are considered in the simultaneous fit. The corresponding nuisance parameters are treated as correlated between the \u03bd \u03bdqq and \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channels in the W W W analysis and between three-lepton and four-lepton channels in the W V Z analysis. These parameters are treated as uncorrelated between the W W W and W V Z analyses. Tables 2 and 3 show the post-fit background, signal and observed yields for the signal regions and the background control region. The contribution to the W V V signal from V H associated production is \u223c 40% in the W W W fiducial regions and \u223c 30% in the W V Z fiducial regions. Contributions from SM processes producing the same detector signature as events in these signal regions (or the tt Z control region) besides those listed are combined into \"Other\". The uncertainties shown include both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Data and predictions agree in all channels. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between data and post-fit prediction of the combined m jj distribution for the \u03bd \u03bdqq channel, the number of selected events for the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel, and the BDT output distributions in the 3 -2j and 4 -DF regions for the W V Z  Table 4. The largest systematic uncertainties come from uncertainties related to data-driven background evaluations affecting the W W W channels, from theoretical uncertainties related to renormalisation and factorisation scale variations and experimental uncertainties. The impact of each systematic uncertainty on the result is assessed and the ranking for the nuisance parameters with the largest contribution to the uncertainty in \u03bc W V V is shown in Fig. 5. Additional fits are performed separately in the W W W and the W V Z channels. For these fits the other signal strength is fixed to its SM expectation. For the fits of the W W W channels, the W Z control region defined in Section 4 is used in the fit. The inclusion of the W Z control region helps constraining the overall normalisation of the W Z+jets background, which in the combined fit is constrained by the W V Z three-lepton signal regions. The tt Z con- trol region is used in the W V Z fit, however, it is not used in the W W W fit. The observed (expected) significance is 3.2\u03c3 (2.4\u03c3 ) for W W W production and 3.2\u03c3 (2.0\u03c3 ) for W V Z production. Table 5 and Fig. 6(a) summarise the observed and expected significances with respect to the background-only hypothesis and the observed best-fit values of the signal strength for the individual and combined fits. The measured signal strengths from the individual fits are converted to inclusive cross-section measurements using the signal samples described in Section 2 and the central values of the theoretical predictions.

The number of selected events in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and the tt Z control region are each included as a single bin in the fit. In total, 186 bins are used in the combined fit. A binned likelihood function L(\u03bc, \u03b8 ) is constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins considered. This likelihood function depends on the signal-strength parameter \u03bc, a multiplicative factor that scales the number of expected signal events, and \u03b8 , a set of nuisance parameters that encode the effect of systematic uncertainties in the signal and background expectations. The nuisance parameters are implemented in the likelihood function as Gaussian, log-normal or Poisson constraints. The same value for \u03bc = \u03bc W V V is assumed for the on-and off-mass-shell W W W , W W Z and W Z Z processes.

Four regions are considered, based on the lepton flavour, namely ee, e\u03bc, \u03bce, and \u03bc\u03bc, where e\u03bc denotes the highest-p T (leading) lepton being an electron, while \u03bce denotes the leading lepton being a muon.Events with an additional veto lepton are removed. The invariant mass of the dilepton system is required to be in the range40 < m < 400 GeV. The upper mass limit reduces the contribution from the W Z+jets process. The leading (sub-leading) jet must have p T > 30 (20) GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The dijet system, formed by the two jets with the largest p T , is required to have m jj < 300 GeV and | \u03b7 jj | < 1.5, where m jj is the dijet invariant mass and \u03b7 jj is the pseudorapidity separation between the two jets. The cuts applied on the dijet system mainly reduce the contributions from the same-sign W W vector boson scattering process. Additionally, in the ee final state, E miss T is required to be above 55 GeV and m must satisfy m < 80 GeV or m > 100 GeV, to reduce contamination from Z \u2192 ee where the charge of one electron is misidentified. This m cut is not applied in the \u03bc\u03bc final state, since the muon charge misidentification rate is found to be negligible, nor is it applied in the e\u03bc and \u03bce final states, where the contamination from Z events is small. To select \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd candidates, events are required to have exactly three nominal leptons with p T > 20 GeV and no identified b-jets.Events with an additional veto lepton are removed. To reduce the contribution from the W Z \u2192 \u03bd process, events are required to have no same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs, and thus only \u03bc \u00b1 e \u2213 e \u2213 and e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 \u03bc \u2213 events are selected.A major background originates from the W Z+jets \u2192 \u03bd +jets process, contributing to the \u03bd \u03bdqq channel when one lepton is not reconstructed or identified, or to the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel, when a Z boson decays into a pair of \u03c4 leptons both of which decay to an electron or muon. Simulation is used to estimate this background.The W Z+jets modelling is tested in a W Z-dominated validation region defined by selecting events with exactly three nominal leptons with one SFOS lepton pair. In addition, events are required to have no b-jets reconstructed, E miss T > 55 GeV and the trilepton invariant mass m > 110 GeV. Data and simulation agree in this validation region, as shown in",
