To determine \u03b3 from the comparison, input is required on the variation within the Dalitz plot of the strong-interaction phase difference between D 0 and D 0 decays. An amplitude model of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 decay can be used to provide this information and this technique has been used to study the B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 , D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode by BaBar [21] and LHCb [22]. In ref. [22] the same dataset is used as the one analysed in this paper. An attractive alternative is to use model-independent measurements of the strong-phase difference variation over the Dalitz plot, which removes the need to assign model-related systematic uncertainties [19,20]. Measurements of the strong-phase variation in binned regions of the Dalitz plot cannot be done with LHCb data alone, but can be accomplished using an analysis of quantum-correlated neutral D meson pairs from \u03c8(3770) decays, and have been made at the CLEO-c experiment [23]. These measurements have direct access to the strong-phase difference, which is not the case for the amplitude models based on fits to flavour-tagged D decays only [24,25]. The separation of data into binned regions of the Dalitz plot leads to a loss in statistical sensitivity in comparison to using an amplitude model; however, the advantage of using the measurements from CLEO is that the systematic uncertainties remain free of any model assumptions on the strongphase difference. This model-independent method has been used by Belle [26] to study the B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 , D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode, and by LHCb [8] and Belle [27] to study B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 decays.",

Similar expressions can be written for the B 0 decay, where the parameter \u03b3 enters with opposite sign. The natural width of the K * 0 (approximately 50 MeV/c 2 [15]) must be considered when analysing these decays. In the region near the K * 0 mass there is interference between the signal K * 0 decay amplitude and amplitudes due to the other B 0 \u2192 DK + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot contributions, such as higher mass K\u03c0 resonances and nonresonant K\u03c0 decays.

An analogous expression can be written for s i which is the sine of the strong-phase difference weighted by the decay amplitude and averaged in the bin. Measurements of c i and s i are provided by CLEO in four different 2 \u00d7 8 binning schemes for the D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay [23]. The bins are labelled from \u22128 to +8, excluding zero, where the bins containing a positive label satisfy the condition m 2 \u2212 \u2265 m 2 + . The binning scheme used in this analysis is referred to as the 'modified optimal' binning. The optimisation was performed assuming a strong-phase difference distribution given by the BaBar model presented in ref. [24]. This modified optimal binning is described in ref. [23] and was designed to be statistically optimal in a scenario where the signal purity is low. It is also more robust for analyses with low yields in comparison to the alternatives, as no individual bin is very small. For the K 0 S K + K \u2212 final state, the measurements of c i and -4 - s i are available in three variants containing a different number of bins, with the guiding model being that from the BaBar study described in ref. [25]. For the present analysis the variant with the 2 \u00d7 2 binning is chosen, given the very low signal yields expected in this decay. The measurements of c i and s i are not biased by the use of a specific amplitude model in defining the bin boundaries, which only affects this analysis to the extent that if the model gives a poor description of the underlying decay then there will be a reduction in the statistical sensitivity of the \u03b3 measurement. The binning choices for the two decay modes are shown in figure 2. The integrals of eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) over the phase space of a Dalitz plot bin are proportional to the expected yield in that bin. The physics parameters of interest, r B 0 , \u03b4 B 0 , and \u03b3, are translated into four Cartesian variables [29,30]. These are the measured observables and are defined as",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The trigger algorithms used to select hadronic and semileptonic B decay candidates are slightly different, due to the presence of the muon in the latter, and are described in sections 4 and 5.",

At the hardware stage at least one of the two following criteria must be satisfied: either a particle produced in the decay of the signal B candidate leaves a deposit with high transverse energy in the hadronic calorimeter, or the event is accepted because particles not associated with the signal candidate fulfil the trigger requirements. At least one charged particle should have a high p T and a large \u03c7 2 IP with respect to any PV, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV fitted with and without the considered track. At the software stage, a multivariate algorithm [44] is used for the identification of secondary vertices that are consistent with the decay of a b hadron. The software trigger designed to select B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 candidates requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a large scalar sum of the p T of the associated charged particles and a significant displacement from the PVs. The PVs are fitted with and without the B candidate tracks, and the PV that gives the smallest \u03c7 2 IP is associated with the B candidate. Combinatorial background is rejected primarily through the use of a multivariate approach with a boosted decision tree (BDT) [45,46]. The signal and background training samples for the BDT are simulated signal events and candidates in data with reconstructed B candidate mass in a sideband region. Loose selection criteria are applied to the training samples on all intermediate states (D, K 0 S , K * 0 ). Separate BDTs are trained for candidates containing long and downstream K 0 S candidates. Due to the presence of the topologically indistinguishable B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 decay, the available background event sample for the training is limited to the mass range 5500-6000 MeV/c 2 . To make full use of all background candidates for the training of the BDTs, all events are divided into two sets at random. For each K 0 S category two BDTs are trained, using each set of events in the sideband. The results of each BDT training are applied to the events in the other sample. Hence, in total four BDTs are trained, and in this way the BDT applied to one set of events is trained with a statistically independent set of events.",

In the BDT for long K 0 S candidates, two further variables are found to provide high separation power: the flight distance significance of the K 0 S decay vertex from the PV and a variable characterising the flight distance significance of the K 0 S vertex from the D vertex along the beam line. The remaining variables in the BDT are the \u03c7 2 IP of the B candidate, the sum of \u03c7 2 IP of the two K 0 S daughter tracks, the sum of the \u03c7 2 IP of all the other tracks, the vertex quality of the B and D candidates, the flight distance significance of the D vertex from the PV, a variable characterising the flight distance significance between the D and B vertices along the beam line, the transverse momentum of each of the D and B candidates, the cosine of the angle between the B momentum vector and the vector between the production and decay vertex, and the helicity angle \u03b8 * .

In the case of the B 0 s \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 background, neither its branching fraction nor the relative fraction of the D * 0 helicity states has been measured.

In these Cabibbo-favoured decays the mass distribution is simpler since the B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 decays are doubly Cabibbo-suppressed, hence allowing the shape parameters and yields for the B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 decays to be reliably determined.

Pseudoexperiments for this fit configuration show that only negligible biases are expected. The fitted yields and parameters of the fit are given in table 2.

The measured R i are not equivalent to the F i fractions required to determine the CP parameters due to unavoidable differences from selection criteria in the efficiency profiles of the signal and control modes. Hence, a set of correction factors is determined from simulation. The efficiency profiles from simulation of D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays are shown in figure 7.

The variation over the D \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 Dalitz plot is smaller, at approximately 35%.

The B mass fit described in section 4 is performed with this background included, where the yield of B 0 \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 decays is constrained relative to that of the B 0 s \u2192 DK * 0 in a similar manner to the B 0 s \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 decays. Although the addition of this background only has a small impact on the mass fit parameters, its CP parameters are unknown. Hence, pseudoexperiments are generated with the B 0 \u2192 D * 0 K * 0 background in three different CP violating hypotheses and are fitted with the default configuration. The uncertainty is found to be less than 0.01 for all choices of the CP parameters. Further pseudoexperiments are generated with B \u00b1 \u2192 D * 0 h \u00b1 and B \u00b1 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, where their PDF shapes and yields are determined from simulation.

For both B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays the resolution in m 2 + and m 2 \u2212 is approximately 0.005 GeV 2 /c 4 (0.006 GeV 2 /c 4 ) for candidates with long (downstream) K 0 S decays. This is small compared to the typical width of a bin, but net migration can occur if the candidate lies close to the edge of a Dalitz plot bin. To first order, this effect is accounted for by use of the control channel, but residual effects enter due to the non-zero value of r B 0 in the signal decay, causing a different distribution in the Dalitz plot. The uncertainty due to these residual effects is determined via pseudoexperiments, in which different input F i values are used to reflect the residual migration.
