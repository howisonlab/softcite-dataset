For the first time these modulations were determined in a four-dimensional kinematic space for positively and negatively charged pions and kaons separately, as well as for unidentified hadrons. These azimuthal dependences are sensitive to the transverse motion and polarization of the quarks within the nucleon via, e.g., the Cahn, Boer-Mulders and Collins effects.",

            "text": "Since the late 1960s the quark-parton model [1,2] has been used to describe the structure of the nucleon in terms of fundamental constituents. Their behavior inside the nucleon was parametrized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs). Historically PDFs depended only on the fractional quark momentum longitudinal to the nucleon direction of motion, x, and on the scale at which the distributions were probed, Q 2 , while transverse degrees of freedom were neglected. These PDFs have provided a good description of processes in which transverse spin and momentum are integrated over [3][4][5]. However, transverse degrees of freedom are not a priori negligible and are needed for a complete description of the nucleon. To account for transverse motion the PDFs have been generalized to transverse-momentumdependent PDFs, known also as TMDs [6][7][8][9][10][11].",

            "text": "Already in the early days of the parton model it was realized that the inclusion of quark intrinsic transverse momentum, p T , leads to modifications of the cross sections in high-energy reactions involving hadrons in the initial state, e.g., in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) [12,13]. In particular, in semi-inclusive DIS transverse momenta give rise to azimuthal dependences of the distribution of the produced hadrons about the direction of the virtual photon [6,8,[13][14][15][16]. In 1978, R. Cahn discussed the emergence of cosine modulations in the semi-inclusive DIS cross section in the presence of non-vanishing transverse parton momentum using simple kinematic considerations (Cahn effect)  [17,18]. Once included, interplay between the parton transverse momentum and the partons's and nucleon's spins can generate further azimuthal asymmetries, as, e.g., in the Boer-Mulders effect. The Boer-Mulders mechanism was introduced for the first time in 1997 [8] in relation to naive-T-odd effects 1  [19,20]. For a long time naive-Todd effects were believed to vanish due to time-reversal invariance [21]. Recently, it was shown that final and initial-state interactions can produce naive-T-odd effects without violating T-invariance [22][23][24]. Because it involves only the parton spin and not the nucleon spin, the Boer-Mulders mechanism is a good example of how spin-related effects may play an important role, even in unpolarized reactions. Measurements of these novel correlations provide insights into the so far poorly explored partonic transverse degrees of freedom and can be used to gather information, in a model-dependent way, about the elusive parton orbital motion.",

The Cahn effect has recently received increasing attention, as it can provide information about the average transverse momentum of unpolarized quarks in unpolarized hadrons. It involves the convolution over transverse momenta of the spin-averaged distribution and fragmentation functions, f q 1 (x, p 2 T ) and D q 1 (z, k 2 T ), respectively. Their transverse-momentum-integrated correspondents, f q 1 (x) and D q 1 (z), are well known [31,32]. However, their p T -and k T -dependences are poorly constrained by measurements, and thus the convolution integrals in Eq. 4 can be estimated only approximately. Moreover, the average intrinsic transverse momentum p T may depend on the parton flavor; thus a flavor-dependent measure of the Cahn effect, via, e.g., semi-inclusive DIS of identified hadrons, is highly desirable.",

Only a few measurements of cos 2\u03c6 and cos \u03c6 amplitudes in semi-inclusive DIS experiments have been published over the past 30 years [34][35][36][37]. Most measurements averaged over any possible flavor dependence as they refer to hadrons without type nor charge distinction, and only hydrogen target [34][35][36] or hydrogen and deuterium targets combined together [37] were available. Recently, the Clas collaboration measured non-zero cosine modulations for positive pions [38] produced by semi-inclusive DIS off the proton. The Compass collaboration presented preliminary cos 2\u03c6 and cos \u03c6 amplitudes in semiinclusive DIS [39] but has not yet published final results. In Drell-Yan experiments non-zero azimuthal modulations have been measured [40][41][42][43][44][45] that violate the Lam-Tung relation [46]. Such a violation can be ascribed to the Boer-Mulders distribution function, as pointed out in Ref. [47]. Sizable modulations have been extracted in pion-induced Drell-Yan reactions, where a valence quark and a valence antiquark annihilate. When a sea parton is involved, as in proton-induced Drell-Yan processes, the measured modulations become smaller, suggesting a small Boer-Mulders function for the sea.",

Hermes acquired data from 1995 to 2007 with various polarized and unpolarized gaseous targets internal to the Hera 27.6 GeV electron/positron storage ring at Desy. In this paper results are presented that were extracted using only the pure hydrogen and deuterium targets, where the lepton beam scatters directly off neutrons and protons (with only negligible nuclear effects in case of deuterium). The spectrometer [48] was a forward-angle instrument consisting of two symmetric halves above and below the horizontal plane defined by the lepton-beam pipe. Particles with polar angles within \u00b1170 mrad in the horizontal direction and between \u00b1(40-140) mrad vertically could be detected. The collected data were processed with a tracking code involving event-level fitting based on a Kalman-filter algorithm [49], which corrects the tracking parameters for the effects from magnetic fields and accounts for all detector materials and known mis-alignments. Lepton-hadron separation with an efficiency better than 98% was achieved using the combination of several detectors: a transition-radiation detector [48], a dualradiator ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector [50,51], a lead and scintillator preshower detector, and a lead-glass calorimeter [52]. Hadron identification was performed using the RICH detector, taking into account the entire event topology simultaneously, rather than a single particle at a time. This provides improved particle identification compared to earlier algorithms (see appendix B for further details).",

For a hydrogen target, scattering off up quarks is expected to dominate the reaction (u-dominance), both because the proton consists of more up quarks than down quarks, and because the elementary lepton-quark cross section is proportional to the squared quark electric charge (e 2 q ), which gives an additional factor of 4 for up quarks compared to down quarks. The Collins function was recently found to have a similar magnitude but opposite sign for fragmentation of up quarks into positive (favored fragmentation) and negative pions (disfavored fragmentation) [65][66][67][68][69]. This would result in different signs for pions of opposite charge, which is in agreement with the data.",

The comparison of this calculation to data indicates that, in the Hermes kinematic regime, the Cahn term is smaller than expected or is counteracted by additional terms that have been neglected. In the same paper, a possible Cahn flavor-dependence was also estimated by varying the p 2 T for down quarks while maintaining a fixed p 2 T for up quarks; no significant changes were observed in the calculated Cahn term. However, this test was performed on a hydrogen target, and not a deuterium target where the results might be more sensitive to the down quarks. In Ref. [71], the authors attempted to simultaneously describe preliminary unidentified hadron cos 2\u03c6 amplitude extracted at Hermes [78] and Compass [39]. The Boer-Mulders-Collins effect is described using the Collins fragmentation function from Ref. [66] while for the Boer-Mulders function, the same functional form that was used for the Sivers function [79] was applied. In the calculation the Cahn effect is also included, which is sensitive to the quark average transverse momenta. The previously reported average momentum of p 2 T = 0.25 GeV 2 [80] describes the Compass data well. In contrast, the Hermes data is better described by the lower value of p 2 T = 0.18 GeV 2 , leading to a smaller Cahn effect at Hermes. This is in accordance to the broadening of the p T distribution when considering Q 2 evolution, as observed in Ref. [81].",

At high z the amplitudes for oppositely charged pions are very similar and reach their largest magnitude (up to \u22120.2). Different behaviors are observed for oppositely charged pions versus P h\u22a5 . The magnitude of the amplitudes for positive pions increases with P h\u22a5 , supporting the Cahn expectations of a signal proportional to transverse momentum. But, this trend is not observed for negative pions, suggesting that contributions to Eq. 5 other than Cahn possibly counterbalance the increase with P h\u22a5 . The Cahn term is expected to be weakly sensitive to flavor, as discussed in the previous section. As in the case of the cos 2\u03c6 amplitudes, the difference between oppositely charged pions can be generated by flavor dependent contributions, like, e.g., the Boer-Mulders-Collins effect.",

The amplitudes are large in magnitude (up to \u22120.1), and have the same negative sign for both positive and negative kaons, in contrast to the trends observed for pions. This may be interpreted by considering the kaon's quark content: the valence quark content of K + mesons is us, and therefore K + production is expected to receive a large contribution from lepton scattering off up quarks (u-dominance). A favored Collins fragmentation function is expected to be involved in this case, as in the case of \u03c0 + . In the framework of the Artru model [83], all favored Collins functions describing fragmentation into spin-zero mesons have the same sign. Therefore, the Boer-Mulders-Collins effect for positive pions and kaons is expected to have the same sign, as observed in measurements. Nothing is known about the Collins fragmentation function into kaons. A significant contribution from sea quarks cannot be excluded. For example, strange quarks may contribute at x < 0.1 [84], as suggested by unpolarized fragmentation, where the strange quark fragmentation function into K + appears to be sig-  Fig. 4, but for the cos \u03c6 amplitudes.",

Figures 10,  11, 12 and 13 show the comparisons of the cos 2\u03c6 and cos \u03c6 amplitudes for the various hadron types produced on a hydrogen and deuterium target. The kaon moments are substantially larger in magnitude than those of the pions, with the exception that the K \u2212 cos \u03c6 U U moments are compatible with those of \u03c0 \u2212 , although their large uncertainties also make them compatible with zero. The cos 2\u03c6 U U moments for negative kaons not only have a larger magnitude but also the opposite sign as the pion moments. A magnitude of K + amplitudes larger than that for \u03c0 + was already observed in the case of the amplitudes measured in transverse-target single-spin asymmetries where the Collins fragmentation function couples to the transversity distribution function [67]. The large amplitudes for kaons suggest a Collins effect that is larger for kaons than for pions; in addition, the differences with respect to pions can arise from a significant role of strange quarks in kaon production. The modulations extracted for unidentified hadrons and pions have similar trends, although some differences are observed, particularly for the cos 2\u03c6 amplitudes. The discrepancies between hadrons and pions are generally consistent with the observed kaon moments. ",
