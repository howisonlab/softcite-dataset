            "text": "Since their discovery by the UA1 [1] and UA2 [2] experiments, the properties and decays of the massive mediators of the electroweak interaction, the W and Z vector bosons, have been studied extensively. The vector bosons decay predominantly into a pair of a quark and an antiquark, whose hadronization results in final states with two or more jets. Exclusive hadronic decays of the W and Z bosons with all final state particles identified are yet to be observed, and most information about the W and Z properties comes from studies of their leptonic decays, W \u2212 \u2192 l \u2212 \u03bd and Z 0 \u2192 l + l \u2212 . Radiative decays of the vector bosons V \u2192 P + \u03b3, where P is a pseudoscalar meson, are sensitive probes of the strong dynamics involved in Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79609, y Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, 110v Valparaiso, Chile, z Yarmouk University, Irbid 211-63, Jordan, hh On leave from J. Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia, meson formation as well as of the vector boson couplings to the photon. Branching ratios of the radiative decays are suppressed by a factor of (f P /M V ) 2 , where f P is the meson form factor, and M V is the vector boson mass. As a result, these decays are expected to be rare, with the standard model (SM) predictions for BR(W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3) ranging from \u223c 10 \u22126 to \u223c 10 \u22129 [3]. However, the sensitivity of the Tevatron experiments is approaching the upper range of the SM predictions, and observation of the radiative W and Z boson decays could provide important information about these processes.",

Since the data in the signal region are consistent with the expected background, we set a 95% C.L. upper limit on the \u03c3(pp \u2192 W ) \u00d7 BR(W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3). We divide the signal region into four 2.5 GeV bins. The limits calculated for each bin are then combined assuming that uncertainties across the bins are 100% correlated. This provides a gain in sensitivity by using information about the shape of the expected W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3 mass peak.",

The electron reconstruction and identification algorithms used in this analysis are discussed in [10]. In addition, a standalone measurement of electron energy in the CES helps to identify electron candidates that radiate a significant fraction of their energy (due to bremsstrahlung) and improves overall electron identification efficiency. This selection results in a sample with \u2264 5% background, the dominant sources of which are W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd, Z 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays and multijet events with one of the jets misidentified as an electron. The backgrounds are subtracted using MC simulation and the resulting \u03c3 \u00d7 BR(W \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd) = (2.67 \u00b1 0.06(stat. + syst.) \u00b1 0.16(lumi.)) nb, is consistent with the previous Tevatron measurements [10]. The dominant source of uncertainty on the cross section is the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity [17], which cancels in the ratio \u0393(W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3)/\u0393(W \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd).",

This improves the previous world's best limit [5] by more than a factor of 10. The corresponding 95% C.L. upper limit on the branching ratio BR(W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3), calculated using the world average BR(W \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd) = 0.1075\u00b10.0013 [15], is 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . While no W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3 signal was observed, the sensitivity of the CDF experiment to this decay channel has reached a level comparable to theoretical predictions. With increases in the dataset size, we expect the sensitivity to improve as 1/ \u221a L, where L is the integrated luminosity.
