Since new physics could manifest itself differently in different final states, it is important that corresponding analyses be performed. At the Tevatron, diboson production has been observed first in fully leptonic and later in semileptonic final states [1]. With the large integrated luminosity now available, together with improved analysis techniques, it has become possible to study diboson production in final states containing heavyflavor (HF) jets. An additional interest for this topic is that such final states are encountered almost identically for a low-mass Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson. It is this aspect of diboson production at the Tevatron that is the focus of this presentation.",

            "text": "The searches for a low-mass Higgs boson in pp collisions have already been reviewed at this conference [2]. Therefore, only a brief summary of the methodology is given here. The relevant production modes are W(\u2192 \u2113\u03bd)H, Z(\u2192 \u2113\u2113)H, and Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)H, with \u2113 an electron or a muon and H \u2192 bb. After a trigger selection based on isolated leptons and/or missing transverse energy (as expected from neutrinos in the final state), simple kinematic and leptonidentification criteria are applied to reduce the initial sample to a manageable level without significant signal loss; the bulk of the remaining background originating from multijet (MJ) production is removed either by further kinematic criteria, or, more frequently in recent searches, by making use of some multivariate analysis technique (MVA); the sample is then enriched in HF jets through the application of a \"b-tagging\" algorithm, and often divided into subsamples according to the number of b-tagged jets and to the level of b purity of those tagged jets; final discriminants are constructed for each of these sub-samples, in which advantage is taken of the kinematic differences between the signal and the remaining backgrounds, most importantly (W/Z)bb, which is irreducible. A variety of MVAs a e-mail: grivaz@lal.in2p3.fr are used, chosen based on some optimization of the search sensitivity but also on the analyzers' expertise: Artificial Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), Random Forests (RF). The final discriminants are subjected to a statistical analysis based on the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) between the background-only and the signal+background hypotheses, with marginalization over all nuisance parameter priors.",

Replacing H \u2192 bb by Z \u2192 bb, the corresponding cross sections are -105 fb for WZ \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb with \u2113 = e or \u00b5, -24 fb for ZZ \u2192 \u2113\u2113bb with \u2113\u2113 = ee or \u00b5\u00b5, -73 fb for ZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdbb, for a total of 202 fb. These cross sections for diboson production are seen to be about 4.5 times larger than the corresponding ones for a 115 GeV mass Higgs boson. It should however be kept in mind that the dijet mass resolution of the CDF and D0 detectors is not sufficient to separate the W and Z dijet mass peaks, so that WW \u2192 \u2113\u03bdcs is a significant resonant background. Furthermore, the nonresonant (W/Z)bb and (W/Z)cc backgrounds and their related systematic uncertainties are substantially larger than for a Higgs boson with a mass 25 GeV above that of the Z boson. On the other hand, there is relatively more signal contribution from Z \u2192 cc than from H \u2192 cc. Altogether, the observation of (W/Z)(Z \u2192 bb), using the same techniques as in the searches for a low-mass Higgs boson, can be considered as the ultimate benchmark for those searches at the Tevatron. A total of eight conference notes or publications relevant to diboson production at the Tevatron with HF jets in the final state were made available for this conference by the CDF and D0 collaborations. The analyses use integrated luminosities ranging from 4.3 to 8.4 fb \u22121 . For reference, the cross sections used by the Tevatron Higgs Combination Working Group for inclusive diboson production are: 11.34 pb for WW, 3.22 pb for WZ, and 1.20 pb for ZZ; they were obtained with mcfm [3] at next-to-leading order.",

The loosest operating point is  chosen to define 0-, 1-, and 2-tag samples, where the two jets with largest p T (leading jets) are considered for b tagging. But the actual values of the tightest operating point passed by each jet are used among the 15 inputs of the final discriminant, a random forest.

The selection requires a large MET with a large significance, and two jets not back-to-back in the plane transverse to the beam direction; it rejects events with an electron or a muon satisfying the criteria of the WZ search reported in Sec. 3.1. The bulk of the MJ background is next rejected using a BDT. The sample is split into a 1-tag and a 2-tag 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 sub-sample, based on the loosest b-tagging operating point as in the D0 analysis reported in Sec. 2.1. As in that same analysis, the remaining b-tagging information is used in the final discriminant, a BDT with 32 (!) inputs. The BDT output in the 2-tag channel is shown in Fig. 6 (top). A signal cross section of 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 times its standard model expectation is obtained, with a significance of 2.8 s.d. (1.9 expected). The observed LLR is compared to expected distributions in the background-only and signal+background hypotheses in Fig. 6 (bottom). The sensitivity of this search is shared by (Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)Z and by (W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd)Z production, where the lepton from the W decay falls outside of the acceptance or fails the identification criteria.",
