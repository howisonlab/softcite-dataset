Results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) confirmed the formation of a new form of matter characterized by deconfinement, which is compatible with the theoretically predicted Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. It has been found that the low transverse momentum (p T < 2 GeV/c) hadron production and multi-particle correlation measurements are well-described by fluid dynamic models, yielding that matter properties are consistent with a perfect fluid that exhibits small shear viscosity over entropy ratio, \u03b7/s [2]. Other observables such as jet suppression are also well-described by models which assume the formation of a QGP [3]. The main conclusions arose from comparisons of heavy-ion data with reference data, such as minimumbias pp and p-A collisions, where no signatures of jet quenching were observed.",

            "text": "The large amount of LHC pp data, allowed two-particle azimuthal correlations to be measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity (N ch ). For the first time, very similar azimuthal anisotropies as in heavy-ion collisions were observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [4]. The analysis was further extended to lower and higher energies [5], as well as other systems such as p-Pb at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV [6,7]. Figure 1 shows the correlation for particles with 1 < p T < 2 GeV/c in low and very-high multiplicity p-Pb events. The long-range structure (often referred to as the near-side ridge) centred at \u2206\u03c6 = 0 and elongated over the full measured \u2206\u03b7 range of 2.9 units is not present in the corresponding low-activity sample. Moreover, also for the first time, two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near side and one on the away side, were observed when the per-trigger yield obtained in low-multiplicity events was subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity events. This suggested that the near-side ridge is accompanied by an essentially identical away-side ridge.   [7]. Primary charged particles were selected in a p T range of 1-2 GeV/c. The near-side peak around \u2206\u03b7 = \u2206\u03c6 = 0 is truncated in the histograms.",

A big progress in this direction has been accomplished, for example using numerical holography, it has been demonstrated that hydrodynamics can describe the evolution of systems as small as R \u223c 1/T eff , T eff being the effective temperature [9]. From the initial state perspective, the azimuthal anisotropy is due to initial state correlations present in the nuclear wave functions of the incoming nuclei [10]. The main question is whether azimuthal anisotropies established during the initial stages of the collision can survive subsequent final state interactions [11]. The third approach relies on partonic and hadronic transport models, for example AMPT [12]. This model qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively) describes small system flow signals for various collision systems and energies. The big issue is that in contrast to fluid dynamic simulation, its applicability relies on a sufficiently large mean free path, which is hard to reconcile with the idea of the strongly coupled hydrodynamic system.",

In particular, at low p T (p T < 3 GeV/c), all spectra are observed to become harder with increasing charged-particle multiplicity density, the effect is more pronounced for heavier particles. Moreover, the modification of p T spectra with respect to the inclusive measurement follows a different pattern for mesons and baryons, except for resonances, which follow baryons at a low-p T of up to approximately 2 GeV/c and tend to be modified similarly to mesons above a p T of 2 GeV/c. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the evolution of the baryon/meson ratios as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 exhibits an universal pattern for all collision systems [16]. This behavior might indicate a common mechanism at work that depends solely on final-state multiplicity density. Figure 2 shows the ratios of the yields of K 0 S , \u039b, \u039e and \u2126 to the pion (\u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 ) yield as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 for pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies. It is worth noting that the ALICE results for small systems [18] are now compared with the latest data from Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. A significant enhancement of strange to non-strange hadron production is observed with increasing particle multiplicity in pp collisions. The behavior observed in pp collisions resembles that of p-Pb collisions at a slightly lower centre-of-mass energy, in terms of both the values of the ratios and their evolution with multiplicity. Strangeness production in heavy-ion collisions can be described in the framework of statistical-hadronisation models [19,20]. While in central heavy-ion collisions, the yields of strange hadrons is consistent with the expectation from a grand-canonical ensemble; the strange hadron yields in elementary collisions, such as pp and e + + e \u2212 , are suppressed with respect to the predictions of the (grand-canonical) thermal models. In the strangeness-canonical approach, within the framework of the THERMUS [21] statistical hadronisation model, the multiplicity and system size dependence of all measured light flavour hadrons can be described, within 2 standard deviations [22].",

On one hand, for isotropic events the average p T is systematically below the spherocity-integrated p T over the full multiplicity range; on the other hand, for jet-like events the p T is higher than that for spherocityintegrated events. Within uncertainties, PYTHIA 8 with color reconnection gives an adequate description of the spherocity-integrated event class. It is worth mentioning that color reconnection was originally introduced to explain the rise of p T with multiplicity [28], and it turned into a \"QCD generator\" of radial flow-like patterns [29]. However, PYTHIA 6 shows a steeper rise of p T with dN ch /d\u03b7 than that seen in data. The comparison of data with EPOS LHC is also shown. Clearly, the quantitative agreement is as good as that achieved by PYTHIA 8. For the jettylike and isotropic events corresponding to 0-10% and 90-100% spherocity classes, respectively, Fig. 3 also shows comparisons between data and Monte Carlo generators (PYTHIA 6, PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC). In low-multiplicity events (dN ch /d\u03b7 < 10), the deviations between data and PYTHIA 8 (without color reconnection) are smaller and larger respectively for the 0-10% and 90-100% spherocity classes than those seen for the 0-100% spherocity class. The effect could be a consequence of the reduction of the color reconnection contribution in events containing jets surrounded by a small underlying event activity. For isotropic events the three models quantitatively describe the correlation. Even for PYTHIA 6, the size of the discrepancy which was pointed out for the spherocity-integrated event class is reduced. On the contrary, for jet-like events both PYTHIA 6 and 8 exhibit a larger disagreement with the data. Last but not least, it is worth mentioning that another approach is under investigation. It is inspired on results from heavy-ion collisions, where particle production is studied in both the jet-like and bulk regions, separately. Namely, the proton-to-pion ratio as a function of p T in the bulk region exhibits a bump structure at intermediate p T [30]. No bump is observed in the jetlike region. Therefore, one can argue that the bump observed in central heavy-ion collisions is a medium-related effect. Similar results for the Lambda-to-kaon ratio were reported for p-Pb collisions [31]. For pp collisions, an analogous separation implies the extension of the traditional underlying-event analysis [32][33][34][35].",

Tracks are divided into several subevents, each covering a unique \u03b7 interval. The multi-particle correlations are then constructed by only correlating tracks between different subevents. In the two-subevent cumulant method, the tracks are divided into two subevents, labelled by a and b, according to \u2212\u03b7 max < \u03b7 a < 0 and 0 < \u03b7 b < \u03b7 max .

Therefore, ratios of different cumulant v n values can directly probe properties of initial-state eccentricity. Using p-Pb data at \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV, the CMS collaboration has improved the precision on the measurement of the v 2 harmonics. Moreover, for the first time the v 3 harmonic was determined using multi-particle correlations [42]. This allows the ratios v 2 {4}/v 2 {2} and v 3 {4}/v 3 {2} to be obtained in order to probe the properties of initial-state eccentricity. Figure 5 shows the ratios v 2 {4}/v 2 {2} and v 3 {4}/v 3 {2} for both p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. For p-Pb collisions, the ratios for v 2 and v 3 are similar within uncertainties, which is consistent with having both the second-and third-order harmonics arising from the same initialstate fluctuation mechanism. Comparing the p-Pb and Pb-Pb data, the v 3 ratios are comparable for both systems, while the v 2 ratios are higher in Pb-Pb than in p-Pb for higher multiplicity values, again reflecting the larger geometric contribution for the larger collision system. The figure also shows that a hydrodynamics-motivated initial-state fluctuation calculation of eccentricities for p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, qualitatively describes the data.",

From the experimental side, new techniques were developed in order to improve the removal of trivial correlations from flow measurements. For example, using the sub-event method a non zero v 2 is observed for pp and p-Pb collisions in accordance with hydrodynamic predictions. Moreover, the anti-correlation between v 2 and v 3 (as expected from hydrodynamics) in small systems has been reported by ATLAS and CMS. However, ALICE data exhibit a different behavior for low multiplicity events, this difference needs to be fully understood. Regarding transverse momentum spectra as a function of multiplicity, radial flow-like behavior is observed in data, and now the role of autocorrelations is under investigation using an event selection based on transverse spherocity. New measurements of strange and multistrange particles as a function of multiplicity have been performed. The MC event generators can not fully describe the data.",
