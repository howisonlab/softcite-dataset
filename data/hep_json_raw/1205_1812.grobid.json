At collider experiments, b taggers allow one to distinguish particle jets containing B hadrons from other jets; these algorithms have been used for many years with great success at CDF. HOBIT has been designed specifically for use in searches for light Higgs bosons decaying via H \u2192 bb. This fact combined with the extent to which HOBIT synthesizes and extends the best ideas of previous taggers makes HOBIT unique among CDF b-tagging algorithms. Employing feed-forward neural network architectures, HOBIT provides an output value ranging from approximately -1 (\"light-jet like\") to 1 (\"b-jet like\"); this continuous output value has been tuned to provide maximum sensitivity in light Higgs boson search analyses. When tuned to the equivalent light jet rejection rate, HOBIT tags 54% of b jets in simulated 120 GeV/c 2 Higgs boson events compared to",

            "text": "At CDF, the search for a light Higgs boson has been a subject of increasing interest and focus in recent years. While there have been numerous successful b-jet identification algorithms (commonly referred to as \"b taggers\") over the years, most have been intended for use in analyses other than searches for H \u2192 bb. Aspects of a given analysis, however, such as the optimal signal-tobackground ratio, or the relative rate of non-b jets originating from gluons in the data sample before tagging, can influence whether a tagger is optimal for the analysis in question. Traditional taggers have tended toward a higher purity and lower efficiency than would be ideal for Higgs boson searches given the relatively low cross section of Higgs boson production at Tevatron energies. While this problem has been circumvented somewhat by taking the logical OR of several taggers, a more elegant and flexible solution can be found in the continuous output of a neural network, tunable for each analysis application.",

The strategy used in developing HOBIT is to build upon the strengths of previous CDF b taggers, address their weaknesses, and construct a new tagger that is highly optimized specifically for finding light Higgs boson decays. HOBIT produces a continuous output variable, allowing efficiency and background rejection to be tuned to meet the requirements of a given search. In the next section, we review some of the general features of b quark decays used by HOBIT to distinguish jets containing B hadrons from jets produced by gluons or light quarks (up, down, or strange). Section 3 then describes some of the previous b-tagging algorithms used by CDF upon which HOBIT is built. We then discuss some features of the CDF detector in Sec. 4, followed by a detailed description of the HOBIT algorithm and training regimen. The performance of HOBIT as characterized by the b-jet tagging efficiency and background rejection rates in data and Monte Carlo (MC) is presented in Sec. 6. We conclude in Sec. 7.",

The most important of these is the relatively long lifetime of a B hadron, augmented in the lab frame by its relativistic boost, which allows it to travel a distance on the order of a millimeter 1 . The B hadron's travel across these macroscopic distances results in a displacement between the location of the pp collision (the \"primary\" vertex) and the B hadron decay (the \"secondary\", or \"displaced\" vertex). These displacements are resolvable by the CDF tracking system, and in particular by its silicon detector. Almost all information as to whether or not a given jet originates from b-quark production is carried in the tracks reconstructed from detector signals left by the jet's charged particles. Specifically, it is possible to identify the decay of a B hadron through the displacement from the primary vertex of the individual tracks it leaves in the detector, and also through the displacement of a B-hadron decay vertex formed by combining multiple displaced tracks in a fit.",

Due to the large mass of the b quark, the collective invariant mass of the decay products of B hadrons will be larger than those from the decay products of hadrons not containing b quarks. Furthermore, the large relativistic boost typical of a B hadron will result in decay products which tend to be more energetic and collimated within a jet cone than other particles. Finally, particle multiplicities tend to be different for jets containing B hadron decays compared to other jets; in particular, muons or electrons appear in approximately 20% of jets containing a B hadron, either directly via semileptonic decay of the B or indirectly through the semileptonic decay of charm hadrons resulting from a B decay.",

SecVtx only uses tracks which are significantly displaced from the primary vertex, accepted by quality requirements, and within a distance of \u2206R < 0.4 of the jet axis. Here, \u2206R = \u221a \u2206\u03c6 2 + \u2206\u03b7 2 , where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the track around the beam axis, and \u03b7 is its pseudorapidity defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 log(tan( \u03b8 2 )), with \u03b8 the polar angle of the track with respect to the beam axis. With these tracks, SecVtx uses an iterative method to fit a displaced vertex within the jet, where the \u03c7 2 of the vertex fit is employed to guide the process. Assuming that this displacement is due to the long lifetime of the B hadron, the significance of the two-dimensional decay length L xy in the plane perpendicular to the beampipe axis is used to select b-jet candidates. The algorithm is utilized with different track requirements and threshold values in order to achieve different efficiencies and purity rates. In practice, three operating points are used, referred to as \"loose\", \"tight\", and \"ultra-tight\". The loose SecVtx operating point decision is used as an input to both the RomaNN and HOBIT tagger. One drawback of the SecVtx tagger is that it is unable to fit a vertex in every b jet. In the Pythia [9] 120 GeV/c 2 Higgs boson Monte Carlo (MC) whose b jets are used to train HOBIT, SecVtx operating at its \"loose\" setting fails to find a vertex in 44.3% of these jets.",

Since the b semileptonic branching ratio is approximately 10% per lepton flavor, this class of tagger is not competitive with SecVtx or the other taggers described below if used alone. However, because a soft lepton tagger does not rely on the presence of displaced tracks or vertices, it has a chance to identify b jets that the other methods cannot. In practice, CDF uses only a soft muon tagger since high-purity electron or \u03c4 identification within jets is difficult. HOBIT uses as inputs the number of soft muon tags within a jet as well as the momentum transverse to the jet axis of the muon with the highest-likelihood tag.",

The performance of a tagger is best evaluated by comparing its purity to tagging efficiency at given operating points.

Examples of such techniques applied to the SecVtx algorithm are using jets containing electrons (therefore HFenriched) for measuring the b-tagging efficiency [16], and using the rate at which jets have a displaced vertex reconstructed behind the primary vertex (\"negative tags\") to estimate mistags [17]. For the tight SecVtx tagger, the b-tag efficiency is found to be well predicted by the MC up to a scale factor (SF), where SF = 0.96 \u00b1 0.05 for the full CDF dataset.

The RomaNN tagger uses several types of NNs: one to distinguish vertices which come from a heavy flavor (B or charm) hadron from false vertices or vertices coming from other hadrons; another to identify unvertexed tracks which come from a heavy flavor hadron; and then another NN which takes as inputs the output of the first NNs along with other inputs, including the loose SecVtx tag status, the number of SLT-identified muons, and the vertex displacement and mass information. Distinct versions of this third NN are trained to separate b jets from light jets, charm jets from light jets, and b jets from charm jets; the outputs of these three flavor-separating NNs are then used to train a final NN whose output is the RomaNN discrimination variable.

            "text": "Outside the tracking systems and the solenoid, segmented calorimeters with projective geometry are used to reconstruct electromagnetic (EM) showers and jets. The EM and hadronic calorimeters are lead-scintillator and ironscintillator sampling devices, respectively. The central and plug calorimeters are segmented into towers, each covering a small range of pseudorapidity and azimuth, and in full cover the entire 2\u03c0 in azimuth and the pseudorapidity regions of |\u03b7|<1.1 and 1.1<|\u03b7|<3.6 respectively. The transverse energy, E T , where the polar angle is calculated using the measured z position of the event vertex, is measured in each calorimeter tower. Proportional chambers and scintillation detectors arranged in strips measure the transverse profile of EM showers at a depth corresponding to the shower maximum.High-momentum jets, photons, and electrons leave isolated energy deposits in contiguous groups of calorimeter towers which can be summed together into an energy \"cluster\". Electrons are identified in the central EM calorimeter as isolated, mostly electromagnetic clusters that also match with a track in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.1. The electron transverse energy is reconstructed from the measured energy in the electromagnetic cluster with precision \u03c3(E T )/E T = 13.5%/ E T (GeV) \u2295 2%, where the \u2295 symbol denotes addition in quadrature. Jets are identified as a group of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter clusters using the jetclu algorithm[13] with a cone size of \u2206R = 0.4. Jet energies are corrected for calorimeter nonlinearity, losses in the gaps betwen towers, multiple primary interactions, the underlying event, and out-of-cone losses[14] . The jet energy resolution isapproximately \u03c3 E T = 1.0 GeV + 0.1 \u00d7 E T .Directly outside of the calorimeter, four-layer stacks of planar drift chambers detect muons with p T > 1.4 GeV/c that traverse the five absorption lengths of the calorimeter. Farther out, behind an additional 60 cm of steel, four layers of drift chambers detect muons with p T > 2.0 GeV/c. The two systems both cover the region |\u03b7| \u2264 0.6, though they have different structures, and therefore places where the geometrical coverage does not overlap. Muons in the region 0.6 \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 1.0 pass through at least four drift layers arranged in a conic section outside of the central calorimeter. Muons are identified as isolated tracks in the COT that extrapolate to track segments in one of the four-layer stacks. 5. The HOBIT Tagger The HOBIT tagger is similar to other multivariate b-tagging algorithms previously used at CDF, such as the RomaNN and Bness taggers. All of these taggers attempt to make maximal use of the available information in b jets, and construct a continuous discriminating variable. HOBIT improves upon these earlier taggers, however, by addressing specific weaknesses of each and optimizing for light Higgs boson searches. 5.1. The architecture HOBIT is constructed as a feed-forward multilayer perceptron neural network implemented using the TMVA package for Root [15]. It consists of two hidden layers of 25 and 26 nodes, there being inputs to the tagger, and a hyperbolic tangent activation function. Five hundred cycles were used in the training. The training regimen used b jets in Pythia [9] 120 GeV/c 2 Higgs boson Monte Carlo (MC) and light jets from Alpgen-generated Pythia W +jets MC. Charm jets were not considered during training due to preliminary studies which indicated a relative insensitivity of light Higgs boson searches to charm jet contamination. Here, \"b jet\" denotes a jet with a B hadron within a cone of \u2206R < 0.4 of the jet axis, while a \"charm jet\" contains a charm hadron but no B hadrons within this cone and a \"light jet\" contains neither B hadrons nor charm hadrons within this cone. Jets were required to have an E T > 15 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2, and at least one track for use in the track-by-track NN described in Sec. 5.3. The 25 inputs to the tagger are a combination of RomaNN and Bness inputs, albeit with some exceptions, additions and modifications. Fourteen of these inputs are also inputs to the RomaNN tagger. A further ten inputs to HOBIT are the ten highest track-by-track NN discriminant output values of tracks in the jet cone. In the event that there are fewer than ten tracks in a jet, the value of the remaining track-by-track NN inputs are set to -1 as this is the light-jet-like value of the NN output. The number of tracks which pass the track-by-track NN selection criteria is found to have additional discriminating power and is also used as an input to HOBIT. Track selections differ between tracks used for RomaNN inputs and tracks evaluated with the track-by-track NN. Tracks used for RomaNN inputs must have p T > 1 GeV/c and be within \u2206R < 0.4 of the jet axis (the same selection used in the published RomaNN tagger), while tracks used by the track-by-track NN inputs had a looser requirement of p T > 0.5 GeV/c and a distance of \u2206R < 0.7 from the jet axis (the original requirement was \u2206R < 0.4). Other selection cuts were considered, but none resulted in an improvement in the performance of HOBIT. Note that one of the RomaNN inputs used (also used in the Bness tagger) is the E T of the jet itself. The various HOBIT inputs are correlated with E T , so the E T provides additional useful information to HOBIT. We prevent kinematic biasing of HOBIT by weighting the light jet training sample to have the same E T distribution as the b-jet training sample. As previously mentioned, one potential weakness of the RomaNN tagger is its inability to produce a useable output when there is insufficient input information. This requirement of \"RomaNN taggability\" can be a liability when very high b-jet tagging efficiency is sought. In the MC sample used to train the HOBIT tagger, 21% of b jets fail to be RomaNN taggable, versus 30% of light jets. The track-by-track NN in HOBIT compensates for this shortfall of RomaNN. While jets in HOBIT are required to have at least one track with an evaluated track-by-track NN output, only 3.0% of b jets and 2.1% of light jets in the MC fail this requirement, indicating a very efficient taggability requirement.",

Hence, while the original Bness track-by-track NN was trained using ZZ \u2192 4 jets MC, the HOBIT track-by-track NN was trained using the same MC as was used to train the overall HOBIT tagger.Since the track-by-track NN operates at the level of individual tracks, we impose an additional requirement on b-jet tracks for the purposes of training by demanding that they be within \u2206R < 0.05 of the actual charged particles resulting from a B hadron decay in the MC. The track-by-track NN employed the same basic framework for training as that used for HOBIT itself (training cycles, inner layer structure, etc.). Some of the inputs to the track-by-track NN take advantage of the fact that tracks from B hadron decays are displaced from the primary vertex. These inputs include the impact parameter, the distance along the z-axis between the track and the primary vertex, and the significance of each. Kinematic inputs such as the p T , rapidity, and track momentum perpendicular to the jet axis (p perp ) exploit the greater collimation of B tracks due to the large boost of the hadron. Finally, the jet E T is an input to the track-bytrack NN, because the previously mentioned inputs are correlated with jet E T . Tracks from light jets are weighted in training such that the jets which contain them have the same E T distribution as the b jets; this is done so as to avoid kinematic biasing in the track-by-track NN. Distributions of the track-by-track NN inputs are shown in Fig. 2. Not shown are the jet E T",
