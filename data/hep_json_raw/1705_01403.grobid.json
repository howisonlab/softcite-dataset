The standard model background, dominated by multijet production, is determined exclusively from control regions in data. No statistically significant excess of events is observed. Model-independent limits on the product of the cross section and the acceptance of a new physics signal in these final states are set and further interpreted in terms of limits on the production of black holes. Semiclassical black holes and string balls with masses as high as 9.5 TeV, and quantum black holes with masses as high as 9.0 TeV are excluded by this search in the context of models with extra dimensions, thus significantly extending limits set at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the LHC Run 1 data.",

One of these is the \"hierarchy problem\" [4], i.e., the vast separation between the electroweak energy scale and the scale at which gravity becomes strong. The latter, referred to as the \"Planck scale\" (M Pl ), is some 17 orders of magnitude greater than the former. There are various theoretical extensions of the SM that address the hierarchy problem, such as supersymmetry (SUSY) and models with extra dimensions.",

As gravity couples universally to the energymomentum tensor and does not distinguish between various particle species, microscopic BHs decay democratically into all SM degrees of freedom, i.e., all SM particle species with all possible values of quantum numbers, such as spin, color, and charge. The final state is therefore populated by a variety of energetic particles, such as hadrons (jets), leptons, photons, and neutrinos. Due to the large number of color degrees of freedom, about 75% of the particles produced are expected to be quarks and gluons. The final state may contain significant transverse momentum imbalance from the presence of neutrinos, which constitute about 5% of the decay products. Other processes, such as the decay of W and Z bosons, or of heavy-flavor quarks, and the possible emission of gravitons or the formation of a noninteracting stable BH remnant, contribute to the transverse momentum imbalance as well.",

Their decays are characterized by the presence of only a few particles, e.g., a pair of jets [26][27][28]. These QBHs could also decay into lepton flavor violating final states, as preserving baryon number or lepton numbers separately is typically not a requirement of the decay process [26,27].",

Such objects, which arise in string theory, are highly excited, long, folded strings that form below the BH production threshold. Like semiclassical BHs, SBs evaporate thermally, but at a constant Hagedorn temperature [30] independent of the SB mass, and also produce a large number of energetic particles in the final state, with the composition similar to that for a semiclassical BH. String balls undergo a phase transition into ordinary semiclassical BHs when their mass reaches M S /g 2 S [29], where M S and g S are the string scale and the string coupling constant, respectively. For an SB mass between M S /g S and the BH transition, M S /g 2 S , the parton-level cross section saturates at \u03c3 \u223c 1/M 2 S , while for lighter SBs, it grows [29]. While our choice of final states is inspired by the production of microscopic BHs, in this Letter we focus on a generic search (Section 8) that can be used to probe a large class of new-physics models. Consequently, our emphasis is on the exploration of a multiparticle final state with a model-independent search.",

The signal region for this search typically lies in the high-multiplicity regime where the QCD multijet background is dominated by higher-order effects.

Studies performed with simulated QCD multijet events and with data at low object multiplicities show that the shape of the S T distribution above its turn-on threshold is approximately independent of the multiplicity of the final state. This observation is consistent with the development of the parton shower via nearly collinear emission, which approximately conserves the S T value, up to the effects of additional jets falling below the kinematic threshold. For this reason one can predict the S T spectrum of a multijet final state using samples of dijet or trijet events. This feature provides a powerful tool to predict the shape of the S T spectrum at higher multiplicity using a low-multiplicity control region. The method has found wide applicability in various CMS searches, such as a search for stealth SUSY [38] and a search for multijet resonances [39]. An earlier CMS analysis [35] also considered other kinematic variables, such as the invariant mass or transverse invariant mass of the event. However, the multiplicity invariance is not exhibited by these variable to the degree shown by the S T variable.",

This variable encompasses the total transverse energy in an event and is therefore useful in discriminating between the signal and the background. There is a minimum transverse energy (E T ) threshold of 50 GeV [35] that each of the objects (including the E miss T ) has to satisfy to be counted toward the definition of S T . The exact choice of the E T threshold is not particularly important; the 50 GeV threshold is chosen as it makes the analysis insensitive to additional interactions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup) and moderates the effect of initial-state radiation, which generally spoils the S T invariance.",

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of the momenta of all its constituents, and is found to be within 5 to 10% of the true (particle-level) momentum over the whole p T spectrum and the detector acceptance. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3 + jet, and leptonic Z + jet events [51,52]. The contribution of charged hadrons that do not originate from the hard-scattering vertex (\"pileup\"), but are clustered during the reconstruction of a jet, is subtracted. Corrections based on the jet area [53] are applied to remove the energy contribution of neutral hadrons from pileup interactions. The jet energy resolution (JER) is approximately 8% at 100 GeV and 4% at 1 TeV [51,52]. The minimum threshold on the corrected E T of the jets used in the analysis is 50 GeV, and jets are accepted in the full pseudorapidity range of the CMS calorimeters (|\u03b7| < 5). To reduce contamination from poorly reconstructed muons, the fraction of the jet momentum carried by a muon is required to be less than 80%. Also, to suppress jets due to rare, spurious anomalous calorimeter signals, jets must contain at least two particles, one of which is a charged hadron, and the jet energy fraction carried by neutral PF candidates (neutral hadrons and photons) should be less than 90%. These criteria have an efficiency greater than 99% per jet.",

The leading order (LO) MSTW2008LO [61,62] PDFs are chosen for all the signal samples. This PDF set provides a conservative estimate of the signal cross section at high BH masses with respect to the modern NNPDF3.0 [63] PDFs. The cross section at large BH masses obtained with different PDF sets can vary up to an order of magnitude. The use of the MSTW2008LO PDF corresponds to the cross section at the lower edge of the uncertainty range for the NNPDF3.0 PDFs, therefore indicating a reasonable and conservative choice for signal simulation. The MSTW2008LO PDF has been recently superseded by the MMHT2014LO [64] set. However, a numerical comparison of the signal cross sections computed using both of these PDF sets reveals no differences. This is expected, as no new data constrain-ing PDFs for processes with such high momentum transfer have been utilized in the global fit used to extract the MMHT2014LO PDF set. Given that MSTW2008LO was the PDF of choice for the Run 1 version of this analysis, the use of this PDF also allows one to directly compare Run 1 and Run 2 results.",

With an aim to compute a conservative estimate of the uncertainty, both the N = 2 and 3 S T spectra are used to estimate the background shape. This leads to six different functions used in the fit: one nominal and five additional ones that form an uncertainty envelope that is symmetrized around the main fit. The shape systematic uncertainty is indicated with the gray shaded bands in Figs. 2  and 3, which show the S T spectrum observed in data for various inclusive multiplicities and the background predictions with their uncertainties. It ranges between 1 and 200% and rapidly increases in the high-S T range because of the limited number of events in the N = 2 and 3 S T spectra used to derive the background templates. We assign an additional 5% systematic uncertainty to address possible deviation from the S T invariance by estimating the difference between the background predictions based on the N = 2 (default) and N = 3 templates. This is a subdominant uncertainty in the high-S T range relevant for the analysis. The systematic uncertainties in the background estimate are detailed in Table 3 of Section 7.  . The deviation of the fit from the data is shown in each lower pane. The lower three plots also show predictions for two semiclassical black hole signal benchmarks added to the corresponding background predictions.

Alternatively, the systematic uncertainty could come from the variations induced by the uncertainties associated with the fit parameters in a chosen PDF set. The latter uncertainty is estimated by calculating 2k + 1 weights per event, where k is the number of alternative PDF sets with parameters varied within their associated uncertainties either up or down. These alternative sets are provided by the authors of each PDF set, along with the main PDFs used in the signal generation. The signal acceptance is then calculated for each of these weights, resulting in 2k + 1 values of the acceptance. For a particular choice of PDF set, the systematic uncertainty in the acceptance is quoted as the sum in quadrature of the deviations from the central value for each of the k PDF eigenvectors. This analysis is further extended by using various PDFs, such as MSTW2008LO, CTEQ6.1L [71], and CT10 [72]. The uncertainty is computed for a particular benchmark scenario, a nonrotating BH with M D = 3 TeV, M BH = 5.5 TeV, and n = 2, representative of the uncertainties for other benchmark points in the range probed by this analysis. The uncertainty in the acceptance using the variation of the chosen PDF, MSTW2008LO, does not exceed 0.5%. The uncertainty due to the choice of the PDF is significantly larger and can be as high as 6%.

Given the predominance of jets in the final state of interest, the uncertainty related to the JES can significantly affect the signal acceptance. The JES is modified by one standard deviation in both upward and downward directions, and the corresponding changes in the jet energies are propagated into the E miss T and S T computation.

These limits represent the minimum \u03c3 A of a potential signal excluded by the analysis and do not assume any particular signal model. This makes the limits applicable to a large variety of BH models and other theoretical models with processes that result in high-multiplicity final states. To obtain the model-independent limits, a counting experiment is performed for Model-independent limits can be used straightforwardly to test any model of new physics that predicts signal corresponding to high-multiplicity, energetic final states. Given that the object selection efficiency is close to 100%, all is needed to test a particular model against the results of this search is to estimate the signal acceptance as a function of the minimum S T requirement, corresponding to the selections described in Section 4, which can be done with sufficient precision even at the generator level. A comparison of the product of the signal cross section and the acceptance as a function of the minimum S T requirement with the model-independent limit at the relevant object multiplicity would then indicate whether a particular model has been excluded by this analysis.",

This was done by using the lowest value of the expected limit, as well as the maximum value of the Z bi [79] statistic, and converting the corresponding model-independent limit into a limit on the BH or SB mass, using the known signal cross section and acceptance. The Z bi statistic is a measure of equivalent Gaussian signal significance obtained by considering the binomial probability of the events in data being distributed at least as signal-like as observed, under the assumption of the background-only hypothesis. In the majority of cases, the limit-and significance-based optimizations are in agreement and lead to the same set of optimum selection requirements. Since the signal MC benchmark points were produced on a grid of discrete M BH values (with a typical spacing of 1 TeV), in order to obtain the mass limit, we smoothly interpolate the signal cross section times acceptance and the exclusion limit between the adjacent points on the grid. Typical precision of this procedure expressed as a limit on the minimum BH mass is \u223c0.1 TeV, although for some of the points where the grid spacing was not as fine, the precision can be somewhat worse.",

Given that the object selection efficiency is close to 100%, all is needed to test a particular model against the results of this search is to estimate the signal acceptance as a function of the minimum S T requirement, corresponding to the selections described in Section 4, which can be done with sufficient precision even at the generator level. A comparison of the product of the signal cross section and the acceptance as a function of the minimum S T requirement with the model-independent limit at the relevant object multiplicity would then indicate whether a particular model has been excluded by this analysis.",
