            "text": "The singly charmed baryon is composed of a charm quark and two light quarks. Charmed baryon spectroscopy provides an excellent ground for studying the dynamics of light quarks in the environment of a heavy quark and offers an excellent laboratory for testing heavy-quark or chiral symmetry of the heavy or light quarks, respectively. Although many new excited charmed baryons have been discovered by BaBar, Belle, CLEO and LHCb in the past two decades [1], and many efforts have been made to identify the quantum numbers of these new states and understand their properties, we do not yet have a fully phenomenological model that describes the complicated physics of this sector [2,3]. Identification and observation of new members in the charmed-baryon family will provide more information to address these open issues.",

However, neither the results of the fit to their spectrum nor the significance of the signal were given; the Particle Data Group (PDG) lists it as a \"one star\" state [1]. Despite the weak experimental evidence for the c (2930) state, it has been taken into account in many theoretical models, including the chiral quark model [5], the light-cone Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) sum rule [6], the 3 P 0 mode [7], the constituent quark model [8,9], and the heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory [10].",

The model for the M B distribution is the sum of a Gaussian function for the signal plus a first-order polynomial for the background. The Gaussian resolutions are fixed to the values from the fits to the individual MC distributions, and the relative signal yields among the five final states is fixed according to the relative branching fraction between the final states and the detection acceptance and efficiency of the intermediate states.   To estimate the c (2930) signal significance, we use an ensemble of simulated experiments to estimate the probability that background fluctuations alone would produce signals as significant as that seen in the data.

Assuming all the above systematic error sources are independent, the DER errors are summed in quadrature for each decay mode, yielding 5.8-8.3%, depending on the mode. For the four branching fraction measurements, the final DER errors are summed in quadrature over the five c decay modes using weight factors equal to the product of the total efficiency and the c partial decay width.

Here, B(K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) or B( \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 ) isincluded in i for the final states with a K 0 S or a . The M + c\u00af \u2212 c spectrum is shown in Fig. 5, in which no clear Y \u03b7 or Y (4660) signals is evident. An unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit is applied to the + c\u00af \u2212 c mass spectrum to extract the signal yields of the Y \u03b7 and Y (4660) in B decays. In the fit, the signal shape of the Y \u03b7 or Y (4660) is obtained from MC simulation directly with the input parameters M Y \u03b7 = 4616 MeV/c 2 and Y \u03b7 = 30 MeV for Y \u03b7 [17], and M Y (4660) = 4643 MeV/c 2 and Y (4660) = 72 MeV for Y (4660) [1]; a third-order polynomial is used to describe all other contributions. The fit results are shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b) for the Y \u03b7 and Y (4660), respectively. From the fits, we have (10 \u00b1 23) Y \u03b7 signal events with a statistical signal significance of 0.7\u03c3 , and (\u221210 \u00b1 26) Y (4660) signal events.",

The differences in the measured c (2930) mass and width are 0.2 MeV/c 2 and 5.3 MeV, respectively, which are taken as the systematic errors. Adding an additional possible resonance with mass and width free at around 2.85 GeV/c 2 into the fit to the M(K \u2212 + c ) spectra, the fit gives M c (2930) = (2929.3 \u00b1 3.1) MeV/c 2 and c (2930) = (21.7 \u00b1 9.3) MeV; the differences of +0.4 MeV/c 2 and +2.2 MeV from the mass and width found without the additional resonance, respectively, are taken as systematic errors. An alternative fit to the M(K \u2212 + c ) spectra with interference between the c (2930) and the phase-space contribution included gives M c (2930) = (2917.0 \u00b1 5.5) MeV/c 2 and c (2930) = (13.8 \u00b1 6.9) MeV; the differences of \u221211.9 MeV/c 2 and \u22125.7 MeV from the nominal mass and width, respectively, are taken as systematic errors. Assuming all the sources are independent, we add them in quadrature to obtain the total systematic uncertainties on the c (2930) mass and width of +0.9 \u221212.0 MeV/c 2 and +5.9 \u22127.9 MeV, respectively. In summary, using (772 \u00b1 11) \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs, we perform an updated analysis of B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 + c\u00af \u2212 c . In the K \u2212 + c mass spectrum, the charmed baryon state c (2930) 0 is clearly observed for the first time with a statistical significance greater than 5\u03c3 . The measured mass and width are M c (2930) = (2928.9 \u00b1 3.0 +0.9 \u221212.0 ) MeV/c 2 and c (2930) = (19.5 \u00b1 8.4 +5.9 \u22127.9 ) MeV.
