The data samples were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to integrated luminosities of 231 \u00b5b \u22121 and 2.96 pb \u22121 , respectively. Calorimeter-based high-transverse-energy triggers are employed to enhance the statistical reach of the high-p T measurements. The results are compared with leading and next-toleading order QCD and with an empirical scaling of measurements at different collision energies using the scaling variable x T \u2261 2p T / \u221a s over the p T range up to 200 GeV/c. Using a combination of x T scaling and direct interpolation at fixed p T , a reference transverse momentum spectrum at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV is constructed, which can be used for studying high-p T particle suppression in the dense QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions at that centre-of-mass energy.",

While the energy dependence of the bulk of particle production with p T below a few GeV/c is typically described either empirically or with phenomenological models, the rest of the spectrum can be well described by a convolution of parton distribution functions, the hard-scattering cross section from perturbative calculations, and fragmentation functions. Such a prescription has been generally successful over a large range of lower energy pp and pp collisions [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Along with measurements of the jet production cross section and fragmentation functions, measurements of high-p T spectra provide a test of factorised perturbative QCD (pQCD) [8] at the highest collision energy to date.",

            "text": "In addition to its relevance to the understanding of pQCD, the charged particle spectrum in pp collisions will be an important reference for measurements of high-p T particle suppression in the dense QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the sizable suppression of high-p T particle production, compared to the spectrum expected from a superposition of a corresponding number of JHEP08 (2011)086pp collisions, was one of the first indications of strong final-state medium effects [9][10][11][12]. A similar measurement of nuclear modification to charged particle p T spectra has been one of the first heavy-ion results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [13]. The reference spectrum for the PbPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV per nucleon can be constrained by interpolating between the pp spectra measured at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV. In this paper, the phase-space-invariant differential yield E d 3 N ch /dp 3 is presented for primary charged particles with energy (E) and momentum (p), averaged over the pseudorapidity acceptance of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) tracking system (|\u03b7| < 2.4). The pseudorapidity is defined as -ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], with \u03b8 being the polar angle of the charged particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction. The number of primary charged particles (N ch ) is defined to include decay products of particles with proper lifetimes less than 1 cm. Using the integrated luminosities calculated in refs. [14,15] with an estimated uncertainty of 11% and 4% at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV, respectively, the differential cross sections are constructed and compared to a scaling with the variable x T \u2261 2p T / \u221a s. Such a scaling has already been observed for pp measurements at lower collision energies [4,5,16,17]. For consistency with the CDF measurements at \u221a s = 0.63, 1.8, and 1.96 TeV, the pseudorapidity range of the x T distributions has been restricted to |\u03b7| < 1.0.",

Beam-induced background events, producing anomalous numbers of low-quality tracks, were rejected by requiring that at least 25% of the charged particles reconstructed in the pixel-silicon tracking system satisfied the highPurity criterion. This criterion, described in ref. [25], consists of numerous selections on the properties of the tracks, including the normalised \u03c7 2 , the compatibility with the beamline and primary vertices, the number of hit layers, the number of '3D' layers, and the number of lost layers. The selection on the fraction of highPurity tracks was only applied to events with more than 10 tracks, providing a clean separation between real pp collisions and beam backgrounds. The remaining non-collision event fraction, determined by applying the same selections to events where only a single beam was crossing the interaction point, is estimated to be less than 2 x 10 \u22125 . Events were required to have at least one primary vertex, reconstructed according to the description in the following section from triplets of pixel hits. A further requirement, namely at least one vertex found from fully reconstructed tracks (see next section for details) with number of degrees of freedom (N dof ) greater than four, was imposed to improve the robustness against triggered events containing multiple pp collisions, i.e., \"event pileup\". The loss in event selection efficiency from the fully-reconstructed-track vertex compared to the pixel vertex alone was determined entirely from data, based on a subset of early runs with negligible event pileup.

The position of the beam-spot, taken as the centre of the region where the LHC beams collide, is calculated for each LHC fill based on the average over many events of the three-dimensional fitted JHEP08(2011)086 vertex positions [25]. The second vertex-finding algorithm, based on fully reconstructed tracks with hits also in the silicon strip tracker, is less efficient in selecting low-multiplicity events, but more robust in discriminating against event pileup. Since pileup is significant over the majority of the analysed data sample, only the fully-reconstructed-track vertex is used to construct the raw charged particle momentum spectra.

Fitted tracks are selected based on the requirement that the transverse impact parameter is less than three times the quadratic sum of the transverse errors on the track impact parameter and the beam axis position. The selected tracks are then passed to an agglomerative algorithm [30], which iteratively clusters the tracks into vertex-candidates. The procedure is halted when the distance between nearest clusters, normalised by their respective position uncertainties, reaches 12. Only vertices consisting of at least two tracks are kept, except when the event contains a single reconstructed track, which occurs in 1.67% (0.99%) of the events at \u221a s = 0.9 7TeV. In the case of multiple vertex-candidates, only the vertex with the most associated tracks is kept. While this occurs in as many as 20% of events, the rejected vertex typically has very few associated tracks and is highly correlated in z position to the vertex with the most associated tracks.

These include the high-Purity selection mentioned in section 3, the requirement of at least five hits on the track, the normalized \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom divided by the number of tracker layers used in the fit less than a maximum value which varies from 0.48 and 0.07 depending on \u03b7 and p T , and a relative momentum uncertainty of less than 20%. Furthermore, to reject non-primary tracks (i.e., the products of weak decays and secondary interactions with detector material), only the pixel-seeded tracking iterations are used, and selections are placed on the impact parameter of the tracks with respect to the primary vertex position. Specifically, the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters are required to be less than 0.2 cm and also less than 3 times the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties on the impact parameter and the corresponding vertex position. In the case of multiple quality reconstructed vertices in the minimum bias event samples, tracks that pass the impact parameter selections with respect to any vertex are used in the analysis. The number of events, by which the track p T distribution is normalised, is then scaled by a factor to account for the event pileup fraction. In contrast, for the jet-triggered samples, tracks are selected based on the impact parameter with respect to the single vertex responsible for the trigger. The primary vertex of the hard-scattering process is identified as the vertex with the largest value of p 2 T for the associated fitted tracks. With the above-mentioned selections applied to the reconstructed tracks, the algorithmic efficiency determined from simulated pythia events is greater than 85% (80%) for tracks with transverse momentum above 2.0 (0.4) GeV/c averaged over |\u03b7| < 2.4 (figure 2(a)).

The region above which the jet trigger with an uncorrected energy threshold of 15 GeV becomes fully efficient is determined by first plotting the leading-jet E T distribution for a sample of events selected with the prescaled minimum bias trigger and the offline selections described in section 3. This distribution is then compared to the subset of those events which also fire the 15 GeV jet trigger as a function of corrected transverse energy. The resulting ratio is the trigger efficiency curve presented in the lower panel of figure 3(a). The 15 GeV jet trigger achieves more than 99% efficiency at a corrected energy of E T = 45 GeV. The analogous procedure is repeated on a sample of events selected by the 15 GeV jet trigger to determine that the 50 GeV jet trigger becomes fully efficient above E T = 95 GeV. For the trigger efficiency study, an early subset of the data (10.2 nb \u22121 ) was used, because the minimum bias and lower-threshold jet triggers were highly prescaled in the later runs. In the upper panel of figure 3(a), the E T distributions from the jet-triggered sample are normalised per equivalent minimum bias event by matching their integrals in the regions where the triggers are fully efficient.",

The contributions to the spectra from the jet-triggered events are normalised per selected minimum bias event; the fraction of minimum bias events containing a leading jet with greater than either 60 or 120 GeV is calculated as shown in figure 3(a) by matching the fully-efficient regions of the leading-jet E T distributions. The three contributions to the combined charged particle transverse momentum spectrum are shown in figure 3(b). The lower panel of that figure compares the combined spectrum first to the minimum bias spectrum alone and then to a spectrum constructed with the addition of only the lower-threshold jet trigger. These are all in good agreement within their respective statistical uncertainties. A p T -dependent systematic uncertainty of 0-4% is attributed to the normalisation of the contributions from the triggered samples. This value is determined by changing the leading-jet E T ranges that separate the three samples (e.g., to E T = 40 and 100 GeV), by basing the normalisation directly on the HLT prescale values, and by comparing the normalisations determined from different subsets of the full data sample.",

The systematic uncertainties assigned to the various tracking corrections are discussed below and are summarised, along with the total systematic uncertainty, in table 2. The uncertainty on the geometrical acceptance of the tracker was estimated from three sources. First, the efficiency of the pixel hit reconstruction was estimated from a data-driven technique involving the projection of two-hit combinations (called tracklets) onto the third layer in search of a compatible hit. The observed efficiency of (99.0 \u00b1 0.5)% leads to a 0.3% uncertainty on the acceptance of pixel-seeded tracks. Second, the variation of the geometrical acceptance was estimated for a variety of generator tunes including pythia8 [35] and the Perugia0 [36] tune of pythia.

At each energy, both CMS measurements are divided by a Tsallis fit [39] to the earlier measurement and the ratios compared in the lower panels. For the earlier measurements, the error bars indicate the statistical plus systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The bands around the new measurements represent all contributions to the systematic uncertainty, except the contribution from the common event selection. Statistical uncertainties are negligible on the new measurements in this p T range. Below p T = 4 GeV/c for the 0.9 TeV sample and below p T = 6 GeV/c at \u221a s = 7 TeV, which are the limits of the previously published CMS spectra, the new results are in reasonable agreement with the earlier measurements. However, the measured spectra do deviate from the Tsallis fits in the earlier papers by as much as 20% at low p T . The origin JHEP08 2011  of the small difference between the two CMS measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV is attributed to the different tracking algorithms used in the two measurements, as well as the different pythia tunes used to determine the tracking corrections.",

Also shown in the figures are various generator-level MC predictions for the yields [27,35,36,40]. The lower plots of figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the ratios of the data to the various MC predictions. As already observed in ref. [34], there is a deficit of p T < 1 GeV/c particles in the predicted 7 TeV spectra for several of the popular pythia tunes. For the whole p T range above 1 GeV/c, pythia8 is the most consistent with the new 7 TeV result (within 10%). This provides an important constraint on the different generator parameters responsible for sizable variations among the tunes. A similar but slightly larger spread is observed in figure 5(a) for different generator parameters at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV, where the CMS measurement is most consistently described by the ProQ20 tune.",

Whereas an exponent n = 5.5 was found in ref. [42] from a global fit to only the previous pp measurements from \u221a s = 0.2 to 1.96 TeV, the x T scaling presented in this paper is optimised for use in an interpolation between the CDF and CMS measurements from \u221a s = 0.9 to 7 TeV. Within this range, the best scaling is achieved with an exponent of n = 4.9 \u00b1 0.1. This is consistent with the predictions of next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations, where the scaling is also found to be optimised for this value of the exponent [42].

In the high-p T range from 5.0-200 GeV/c, where approximate x T scaling is expected to hold, the estimated 2.76 TeV cross section is derived from a common x T -scaling curve, based on the CDF and CMS measurements shown in figure 6(a). In the low-p T range from 1.0-20 GeV/c, it is possible to interpolate directly between the several measured cross section values as a function of \u221a s at each fixed p T value. As discussed in the previous section, the upper panel of figure 6(b) shows the residual difference from perfect x T scaling with exponent n = 4.9 for the 0.9 and 7 TeV CMS measurements and for the 1.96 TeV CDF measurement [4,5] . The \u221a s and x T dependence of the residuals are not unexpected, since this behaviour is predicted by NLO calculations. This can be seen in the lower panel of figure 6(b), which shows the predicted deviation from perfect x T scaling for calculated NLO cross sections at several collision energies with respect to a reference centre-of-mass energy of 2.75 TeV [42]. The calculations were performed using the CTEQ66 parton distribution functions [46], DSS fragmentation [47], and a factorisation scale \u00b5 = p T [42]. Taking the magnitude of the x T -scaling violation from NLO (ranging from 0-20%), each of the three measurements in data (i.e., 0.9, 1.96, and 7 TeV) can be corrected separately to arrive at an expectation for the 2.76 TeV cross section. The three independent interpolations based on NLO-corrected x T scaling are shown as solid blue lines in the upper panel of figure 6(b). The combined 'best estimate' (shown as a shaded band) has an associated uncertainty that covers the deviations of up to 12% observed by varying the factorisation scale from \u00b5 = 0.5 p T to \u00b5 = 2.0 p T for each of the three collision energies. The error band is expanded below p T \u2248 8 GeV/c to include the full difference between the 1.96 and 7 TeV results, since the evolution of the spectra below this valuecorresponding to x T = 0.0023 (7 TeV), 0.0082 (1.96 TeV), and 0.018 (0.9 TeV) -is no longer consistently described by x T scaling and the NLO-based corrections. In addition to the 12% contribution from the uncertainty on the NLO-based correction, the final uncertainty on the interpolated cross section has an additional component to account for possible correlations in the luminosity uncertainty between the three measurements. This term, taken as equal to the smallest individual uncertainty (4%), is added in quadrature.",

The latter measurement is converted to a differential cross section assuming the total inelastic cross section of 60.52 mb from pythia. At each energy, an empirical fit to the p T distribution is first constructed to provide a continuous estimation independent of different binning. Then, in arbitrarily small p T bins, these empirical fits are evaluated and the evolution of the cross section with \u221a s is parametrised by a second-order polynomial. Two examples of these fits are shown in figure 7(a) for p T = 3 and 9 GeV/c. The uncertainty on the value of the fit evaluated at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV is taken from the covariance matrix of the fit terms,",

In the p T range where the two techniques overlap, the different methods agree to within their respective systematic uncertainties. (The fixed-p T interpolation value is typically around 8% lower than the x T interpolation.) The resulting predicted 2.76 TeV differential cross section is shown in the upper panel of figure 7(b), and its ratio with respect to various pythia tunes at that centre-of-mass energy in the lower panel. The uncertainty on the predicted cross section, shown by the grey band in the lower panel, is the weighted sum (where applicable) of the uncertainties derived from the two methods described in the preceding paragraphs. Also shown in the lower panel of figure 7(b) is the ratio of the predicted 2.76 TeV cross section to that found by simply scaling the CMS measured 7 TeV result by the expected 2.75 TeV to 7 TeV ratio from NLO calculations [42]. The interpolation used in the recent ALICE publication [13] is a few percent lower than the result quoted in this paper, but consistent within the respective systematic uncertainties. The behavior of the various generators compared to the interpolated 2.76 TeV cross section is broadly similar to the 0.9 TeV invariant yields presented in figure 7(b). The ProQ20 tune agrees most closely (within 15%) with the interpolated cross section above 2 GeV/c. Future analysis of a recently recorded 2.76 TeV pp collision sample will provide verification of this result and a reduction in the systematic uncertainties.",

The results have been shown to be in reasonable agreement with the previously published CMS measurements at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV [24,34] and, except for the surplus of tracks at very low transverse momentum, with pythia leading-order pQCD. The 7 TeV data are most consistent with pythia8, which agrees at the 10% level over the full p T range of the measurement. In contrast, the 0.9 TeV data are considerably better described by the ProQ20 tune. Additionally, the consistency of the 0.9 and 7 TeV spectra has been demonstrated with an empirical x T scaling that unifies the differential cross sections from a wide range of collision energies onto a common curve. Furthermore, within the theoretical uncertainties of the NLO calculations, the residual breaking of x T scaling above p T \u2248 8 GeV/c is consistent between the measured cross sections and the NLO calculations.",
