There are many experimental efforts with a variety of techniques. Some (EXO, Kamland-Zen, GERDA phase I and CANDLES) started take data in 2011 and EXO has reported the first measurement of the half life for the double beta decay with two neutrinos of 136 Xe. The sensitivities of the different proposals are reviewed.",

The latter case is very interesting since lepton number is violated and it would establish that the neutrino is its own anti-particle.",

Consequently, there is a large interest in nuclear matrix element calculations and substantial progress has been made during the last years. Traditionally, nuclear shell model (NSM) and quasi particle random phase approximation (QRPA) calculations have been performed. Recently new approaches like the interacting boson model (IBM), the generating coordinate model (GCM) and the projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (pHFB) method have been applied.
