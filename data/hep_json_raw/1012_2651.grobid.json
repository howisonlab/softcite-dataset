The most precise measurements [4,5] of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 come from decays where 6,7]. Here, h is \u03c0 or K. Other promising D 0 final states are K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [8,9]. All these measurements depend on parameters related to the decay of the D 0 meson. Knowledge of the D-decay parameters a priori can greatly improve the determination of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 . These proceedings summarise the measurements [10,11] of these parameters made by the CLEO collaboration and estimates their impact on the determination of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 .",

            "text": "comes from studying differences between the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 Dalitz plot for both B \u2212 and B + decays. Current measurements of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 require a model of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 Dalitz plot, which is derived from flavortagged samples of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 . The assumptions used to determine the model introduce a systematic uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 which is estimated to be between 3 \u2022 and 9 \u2022 [4,5]. This is significantly less than the current statistical uncertainty but it will be a limiting factor in future measurements [12,13]. Therefore, it is desirable to perform the measurement in a model-independent manner. Such a method was proposed in Ref. [6] and has been developed significantly by Bondar and Poluektov [14]. The method requires determining yields in bins of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 Dalitz plot for B \u2212 and B + decay, which depend on the B-decay parameters and two new parameters c i and s i , which are the amplitude-weighted averages over the bin of the cosine and sine of the difference in strong-phase difference, \u2206\u03b4 D , between Dalitz-plot points (m 2 \u2212 , m 2 + ) and (m 2 + , m 2 \u2212 ). Here m \u00b1 is the invariant-mass of the K 0 S h \u00b1 pair. It can be shown [10,14] that between 80% to 90% of the statistical sensitivity to \u03b3/\u03c6 3 of the unbinned method can be obtained by choosing bins corresponding to equal intervals of \u2206\u03b4 D according to an amplitude model. An example of such a binning is shown in Fig. 1.",

However, the dynamics are more complicated because there is variation of the strong-phase difference over the multi-body phase-space. This leads to the introduction of a new parameter referred to as the coherence factor R F (F = K\u03c0\u03c0 0 or K3\u03c0), which multiplies the interference term sensitive to \u03b3/\u03c6 3 . The value of R F can vary between zero and one. If there is only a single intermediate resonance or a few noninterfering resonances the coherence factor will be close to one and the decay will behave just like D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . If there are many overlapping intermediate resonances the coherence factor will tend toward zero, limiting the sensitivity to \u03b3/\u03c6 3 . However, even if there is limited sensitivity to the phases when R \u223c 0 there is enhanced sensitivity to the magnitude of the amplitude ratio between the B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 decays; improved knowledge of this parameter will then lead to better overall sensitivity to \u03b3/\u03c6 3 in a global fit to all",

However, this is replaced by uncertainty due to the limited statistics used to measure c i and s i at CLEO-c. This uncertainty is estimated to be between 1.7 \u2022 and 3.9 \u2022 (3.2 \u2022 and 3.9 \u2022 ) depending on the binning of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 ) Dalitz plot. The systematic uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 can be reduced by about a factor of three if BES-III collects 10 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity at the \u03c8(3770) resonance [19]. This would reduce the uncertainty to the order of 1 \u2022 , which would not only be adequate for LHCb but also for future higher luminosity facilities [13,20].",

The introduction of the CLEO-c constraints is equivalent to 70% more LHCb data. This clearly illustrates the power of quantum-correlated measurements in aiding the determination of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 .
