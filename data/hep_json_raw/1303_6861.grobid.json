This is followed by a software stage that applies a full event reconstruction. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a high sum of the p T of the tracks and a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices. At least one track should have p T > 1:7 GeV=c and IP 2 with respect to the primary interaction greater than 16.
