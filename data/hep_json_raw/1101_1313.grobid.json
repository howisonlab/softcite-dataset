Newly proposed experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes. For example, the annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons is expected to yield worldleading sensitivities to hyperon rare decays and CP violation. It could also provide the world's most intense source of tagged D 0 mesons, and thus the best near-term opportunity to study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search for new physics. Other precision measurements that could be made include properties of the X(3872) and the charmonium system. An experiment using a Penning trap and an atom interferometer could make the world's first measurement of the gravitational force on antimatter. These and other potential measurements using antiprotons could lead to a broad physics program at Fermilab in the post-Tevatron era.",

            "text": "Hyperon and charm CP violation provide windows into physics beyond the Standard Model that are complementary to those in the B and K sectors [1,2]. With substantial expected charm and hyperon production and low backgrounds, medium-energy antiproton annihilation can potentially yield event samples large enough to reveal effects of new physics that may have been missed in previous studies. 1 A very capable experiment for such studies can be mounted inexpensively at the Fermilab Antiproton Accumulator, by adding a magnetic spectrometer to the existing Fermilab E760 lead-glass calorimeter [3], using an available BESS solenoid [4], fine-pitch scintillating fibers (SciFi), the D\u00d8 SciFi readout system [5], and hadron ID via fast timing [6]. If the relevant cross sections are as large as expected, this apparatus could enable world-leading studies of hyperon and charm CP violation and rare decays, charm mixing, and X (3872) properties, along with those of other charmonium and nearby states, as is now proposed to Fermilab [7]. If approved, the experiment could start about a year after completion of the Tevatron Collider run. Charm D 0 -D 0 mixing is now established at > 10 standard deviations [8], but the < \u223c 1% values of the reduced mixing parameters x and y are small enough to be possible Standard Model effects [1]; the \"smoking gun\" for new physics in charm mixing will thus be CP violation [1,9]. Unlike the beauty and kaon cases, Standard Model effects in charm are highly suppressed, offering a low-background venue for new-physics studies; moreover, some classes of new physics could be inherently more visible in interactions of \"up-type\" rather than \"down-type\" quarks. The annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons with nucleons in a fixed target offers a charm cross section potentially of order microbarns, 10 3 times larger than that at the B factories, along with low combinatoric background, making it possibly the ideal way to search for new physics via rare effects in charm. Hyperons Having acquired (as of 1999) the world's largest HEP data sample, the Fermilab Hy-perCP experiment [10] found evidence (at < 3 standard deviations) for new physics in hyperon CP violation and rare decays [11,12], indicating the need for yet more data. An experiment designed to accomplish the charm studies just discussed can also acquire very large samples of hyperon decays and push precision hyperon studies to the next level of sensitivity. X/Y/Z states The B factories discovered new states in the charmonium region, not all of which can be charmonium levels [13]. For example, the width of the puzzling X (3872) resonance (seen in four experiments) may well be \u226a 1 MeV [14]. The unique pp precision, reflecting the small pbeam \u03b4 p/p and absence of Fermi motion in a hydrogen target, is thus what is needed to establish whether this state is a D * 0 D 0 molecule [15], a tetraquark state [16], or something else entirely.",
