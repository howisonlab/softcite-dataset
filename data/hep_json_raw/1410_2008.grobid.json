When performing both of these searches we assume that the sterile mass splitting is large, allowing sin 2 (\u2206m 2 L/4E) to be approximated as 0.5, and we assume that there is no mixing between electron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos (|Ue4| 2 = 0). No evidence of sterile oscillations is seen and we limit |U\u00b54| 2 to less than 0.041 and |U\u03c44| 2 to less than 0.18 for \u2206m 2 > 0.1 eV 2 at the 90% C.L. in a 3+1 framework. The approximations that can be made with atmospheric neutrinos allow these limits to be easily applied to 3+N models, and we provide our results in a generic format to allow comparisons with other sterile neutrino models.",

            "text": "The flavor oscillations of massive neutrinos have been well established by a wide range of experiments looking at the disappearance of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere [1,2], in the Sun [3][4][5][6][7][8], in nuclear reactors [9][10][11][12], and at particle accelerators [13][14][15] where recently the appearance of electron and tau neutrinos were observed in primarily muon neutrino samples [16][17][18]. The evidence from these experiments suggest two independent neutrino mass differences, an 'atmospheric' \u2206m 2 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and a 'solar' \u2206m 2 \u2248 7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 , requiring that three neutrinos are participating in oscillations. Experiments at the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) also probed the number of neutrinos using the width of the Z 0 mass peak, which depends on the number of neutrino flavors into which a Z 0 can decay. A combined analysis of all the LEP data measured 2.980 \u00b1 0.0082 light neutrino families [19].",

            "text": "However, not all neutrino experiments are consistent with this three-flavor picture; several hints of another, larger mass splitting have appeared. The LSND experiment observed\u03bd e appearance in a\u03bd \u00b5 beam consistent with two-flavor oscillations with \u2206m 2 \u2248 1 eV 2 [20]. The later MiniBooNE experiment saw some possible signs of\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e as well as \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations at a similar \u2206m 2 [21]. Additional anomalies appear in experiments looking at intense\u03bd e and \u03bd e sources at distances too short for standard oscillations: a lower rate of\u03bd e 's than predicted was seen at several reactor experiments [22,23], and the rate of \u03bd e 's from 51 Cr and 37 Ar calibration sources at Gallium-based solar neutrino experiments was 3\u03c3 lower than the expected rate [24][25][26][27][28]. Both of these hints are consistent with oscillations driven by a \u2206m 2 > 1 eV 2  [29]. In order for the interpretation of these measurements to coexist with the well-established solar and atmospheric mass-splittings, at least one additional neutrino must be introduced. The LEP measurements further require that any additional neutrinos either be heavier than half the Z 0 mass, which would make it difficult for them to participate in oscillations, or not couple to the Z 0 boson, and hence not participate in weak interactions. These non-interacting neutrinos are called 'sterile.' * Deceased.",

The par-ticles radiate Cherenkov photons in a cone (42 \u2022 in water for particles with velocity close to c) as long as the particle is above threshold, producing a circular pattern of light which is projected onto the wall of the detector. Particles which stop inside the detector produce a ring while those that exit produce a filled circle. The timing of the Cherenkov light allows the vertex to be reconstructed, and the direction of travel of the particle is estimated from the vertex and the Cherenkov ring pattern. More energetic particles typically produce more total light. Particle types are identified based on the pattern of the hits making up the ring. Electrons and photons produce electromagnetic showers which create many overlapping rings and appear as a single ring with a fuzzy edge. Non-showering particles (muons, pions, protons) produce concentric light cones as they travel and appear as a single ring with a sharp outer boundary.",

Instead of distance, we bin the data in zenith angle, cos \u03b8 z , defined as the angle between the event direction and the downward vertical direction. The neutrinos with the shortest path lengths are downward-going (cos \u03b8 z near 1) and the neutrinos with the longest path lengths are upward-going (cos \u03b8 z near -1). The simulation which predicts the number of neutrino events in each bin includes a distribution of neutrino production heights based on a model of the atmosphere described in more detail in [40]. This range of production heights introduces a smearing of the oscillation probability for a given zenith angle for downwardgoing and horizontal events but is negligible for upwardgoing events which cross most of the Earth.

These events have the best energy resolution since all of the energy is contained within the detector. However, they also have the worst direction resolution (from 12 \u2022 to 100 \u2022 , depending on energy [43,44]) since the outgoing lepton direction is less correlated with the incoming neutrino direction. In the oscillation analysis, the FC sample is divided into 13 subsamples, categorized based on visible energy into sub-GeV, below 1.33 GeV, and multi-GeV, above 1.33 GeV. The FC subsamples are then binned in energy and cos \u03b8 z , though a few sub-GeV subsamples with particularly poor direction resolution have only a single cos \u03b8 z bin. Details of which bins are used in which subsample are shown in Tab. II. The sub-GeV events are categorized into \u00b5-like, e-like, and neutral-current \u03c0 0 -like samples. The \u00b5-and e-like subsamples are further divided by number of decay electrons, which can signify the presence of a charged pion produced below Cherenkov threshold and thus help isolate NC backgrounds. The Multi-GeV subsamples are split into \u00b5-like and e-like, with the e-like events divided into \u03bd e -like and\u03bd e -like. The FC sample selection techniques are described in greater detail in [41]. The Partially contained (PC) sample contains events that have vertices in the fiducial volume, but produce leptons that leave the inner detector. They have long tracks and so are almost exclusively from \u03bd \u00b5 interactions and range in energy from a few GeV up to tens of GeV. These events have better direction resolution (9 \u2022 -16 \u2022 [43]) than FC events due to their higher energy, but worse energy resolution since the exiting muon carries some energy out of the detector. They are divided into two subsamples based on their energy deposition in the OD: stopping, which stop in the outer detector, and through-going, which pass through the outer detector out into the rock [2]. They are binned in both visible energy (based on light observed in the ID) and cos \u03b8 z .",

II. Several improvements to the simulation have been included since the last atmospheric neutrino oscillation publication [41]. The neutrino interaction generator, NEUT [47], includes an updated tau-neutrino cross section and a more accurate calculation of the NC elastic scattering cross section [48]. This version also includes an improved model of photon emission from excited nuclei based on recent experimental data [49,50] and improved spectroscopic factor simulation [51]. The pion interaction model was also improved: interaction probabilities were tuned to existing pion scattering data [52], particularly at low momentum, < 500 MeV/c, while at higher momenta the model, including both interaction probabilities and kinematics, was updated to the SAID partial wave analysis of world data [53][54][55]. In all energy regimes, nucleon ejection after pion absorption in the nucleus was implemented with multiplicity determined by data in [56] and the kinematics of the two-body ejection modeled with the data-based parameterization in [57].",

We assume the sterile mass splittings are sufficiently large that oscillations in all samples are 'fast' and the L/E term, sin 2 (\u2206m 2 L/4E), can be approximated as sin 2 = 0.5. For the SK data, this assumption is good for \u2206m 2 > 10 \u22121 eV 2 . The complex phases introduced by the additional neutrinos are also neglected in this treatment since they were shown in [60] to have a negligible impact on the atmospheric neutrino sample. We also assume that there are no \u03bd e \u2212 \u03bd s oscillations. While hints of these |U e4 | 2 -driven oscillations have been seen in short-baseline \u03bd e /\u03bd e disappearance [22], SK is not very sensitive to this parameter. We estimate that allowing non-zero |U e4 | 2 values of the size allowed by these other experiments reduces SK's sensitivity to |U \u00b54 | 2 by between 3% and 40%, depending on which experiment is used and what \u2206m 2 value is assumed. In order to avoid introducing a complex multi-experiment fit, we assume |U e4 | 2 = 0. All of these assumptions are discussed further in Appendix B.",

A non-zero |U \u03c4 4 | 2 also makes \u03b8 s nonzero, which enhances the matter effects further. While |U \u00b54 | 2 also contributes to A s , for densities available on Earth the fast oscillation effect is always much stronger than the matter effect, so any measurement of |U \u00b54 | 2 will come primarily from fast oscillations.

The best fit point is defined as the global minimum of this map. Tests performed with high-statistics simulation, both without and with simulated sterile neutrino signals, showed no significant biases in the extracted best fit points.",

The fit is performed on a one-dimensional grid of 200 points distributed logarithmically between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22121 . The best fit is at |U \u00b54 | 2 = 0.016 with \u03c7 2 min = 532.1 over 480 bins (goodness-of-fit p = 0.05). No sterile oscillations is slightly disfavored by \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1.1. Figure 6 shows the best fit from this analysis in several \u00b5-like samples which closely matches the prediction without sterile neutrinos (the ratio is approximately unity across all bins). In fact, there is no net difference in \u03c7 2 between the best fit point and the prediction without sterile neutrinos looking just at the difference between the data and the prediction in each bin. All of the difference in \u03c7 2 at the best fit come from the reduction in the systematic penalty term from introducing a non-zero |U \u00b54 | 2 . The dashed line in Fig. 6 shows the prediction with the best fit sterile parameter, but without separately minimizing the systematic uncertainties. It shows the effect of a nonzero |U \u00b54 | 2 in isolation: it lowers the normalization in the  6. (color online) Ratios to the MC prediction without sterile neutrinos, binned in zenith angle and summed across SK-I through SK-IV, for three \u00b5-like sub-samples at low (FC Sub-GeV), medium (FC Multi-GeV), and high energies (though-going UP-\u00b5). The prediction without sterile neutrinos has been fit to the data using the systematic uncertainties. The black points represent the data with statistical error bars and the solid red line shows the MC prediction with the best fit for sterile neutrinos (|U\u00b54| 2 = 0.016), including the best fit systematic uncertainties. In all the samples it lines up close to unity, meaning the prediction is nearly identical to the prediction without sterile neutrinos. The dashed red line shows the MC prediction with the same sterile component (|U\u00b54| 2 = 0.016), but now with the same systematic uncertainty parameters as the denominator, showing the effect of just the sterile oscillations: the normalization is shifted downward by approximately 3% in every \u00b5-like sample.  7. The 90% and 99% upper limits on |U\u00b54| 2 from the sterile vacuum fit to Super-K is shown in the solid and dashed and vertical lines, respectively. The gray filled region is excluded at 90%. This analysis is not sensitive to \u2206m 2 , but the experiments who also measure |U\u00b54| 2 are, so here the onedimensional Super-K result is shown in two dimensions.The dotted line is the 90% limit placed by the joint analysis of MiniBooNE and SciBooNE [35] and the dot-dash line is the 90% limit placed by the CCFR experiment [34].  \u00b5-like samples by approximately 3%. By introducing this normalization change with the sterile oscillation parameter, several systematic error parameters can be moved closer to their nominal values, reducing the \u03c7 2 penalty term. The reduction is concentrated in three systematic errors: the (\u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 )/(\u03bd e +\u03bd e ) ratio in the atmospheric flux below 1 GeV and from 1 \u2212 10 GeV as well as the CCQE \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd e cross-section ratio, summarized in Tab. III. All three of these systematic errors relate to the relative normalization between the \u00b5-like subsamples, which have sterile oscillations, and the e-like subsamples, which do not. These two flux systematics specifically affect the low-energy subsamples and the CCQE interaction mode is dominant at lower energies, so it affects the same sub-samples. The flux uncertainty is calculated as part of the neutrino flux model, which uses direct muon flux measurements plus simulations of hadronic interactions in the atmosphere constrained by hadron production experiments [58]. The uncertainty is between 2% and 3% in size at these energies. The CCQE cross-section uncertainty comes from the difference between the default model in NEUT [66] and a local Fermi gas model [67] and is 1% to 1.5% in size. While the sterile oscillations create effects in basically every \u00b5-like sample, these lowenergy samples are the most important in this analysis since they have the highest statistics and thus the smallest statistical uncertainties.",

This effect is visible almost everywhere in the atmospheric data, except where P (3) \u00b5\u00b5 \u2192 0 (see Fig. 3). The constant term creates an opposing, but smaller effect which reduces disappearance but it is usually overwhelmed by the scaling term. The effect of the constant term can only be seen in the 'valleys' of the oscillation probability where P (3) \u00b5\u00b5 \u2192 0. In atmospheric neutrinos, the bottoms of these valleys are not clearly resolved, so this effect is vanishingly small (as opposed to in long-baseline experiments which precisely measure the first oscillation minimum).

            "text": "The atmospheric neutrino data from all four periods of Super-Kamiokande have been fit to look for evidence of oscillations with an additional sterile neutrino. The fit was performed with two different approximations appropriate for setting limits on the two new matrix elements in the 3+1 framework to which Super-K is sensitive: |U \u00b54 | 2 and |U \u03c4 4 | 2 . No significant evidence for fast oscillations driven by a new large \u2206m 2 or of the matter effect associated with oscillations from \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd s are seen. We limit the 3+1 parameters |U \u00b54 | 2 to less than 0.041 and |U \u03c4 4 | 2 to less than 0.18 at 90%. While the measurement of |U \u00b54 | 2 is limited by systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux and cross section around 1 GeV, the constraint on |U \u03c4 4 | 2 can potentially improve with additional atmospheric data. Assuming only a single sterile neutrino, these new limits increase the known tension between \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance measurements and the hints seen in the \u03bd e appearance and disappearance channels. Since these limits are independent of the size of the new \u2206m 2 , they exclude some new regions of parameter space at low mass-splittings where beam experiments are not sensitive. They can also be extended readily to 3+N models which might resolve the tensions between the three channels, and the results are provided in a format to allow tests of more general models in the supplemental materials [69].",

When this extra free parameter is introduced, the limit on |U \u00b54 | 2 turns out to be correlated with the limit on |U e4 | 2 , as shown in the sensitivity contours in Fig. 9. With |U e4 | 2 unconstrained, the expected 90% limit on |U \u00b54 | 2 becomes 0.067, 180% larger than the 0.024 90% sensitivity limit with the assumption of |U e4 | 2 = 0. However, once constraints from other experiments are introduced the effect is significantly reduced. The [60] paper introduces a constraint of |U e4 | 2 < 0.012 at the 1\u03c3 level based on a value from the Bugey [70] limit around \u2206m 2 = 1 eV 2 . Applying this constraint to this analysis leads to a 17% change in our sensitivity. In the low-\u2206m 2 region, where our results are most competitive, the change is only 3%, while at the highest \u2206m 2 's the change can be as large as 30%. If instead the non-zero hints from global fits are used as constraints, the change in our limit ranges from 10% to 40%, with the larger effects again occurring at higher \u2206m 2 . A proper accounting of these constraints would require a global fit to multiple experiments introducing \u2206m 2 and |U e4 | 2 as fit parameters, which is beyond the scope of this analysis; instead we take the approach used in [60] and the atmospheric section of [29] and assume |U e4 | 2 = 0.",

These averages vs. \u2206m 2 for the four samples can be seen in Fig. 10. Setting a threshold of 5% error on the value of sin 2 , we find that the fast oscillation sample is valid until approximately 10 \u22121 in all four samples. The highest limit is 0.13 in the PC sample where there are both high energies and the very short track lengths from down-going events.",

The upper limit on the mass for which the limits are valid is set by the requirement that the mass-splitting is sufficiently small that the neutrinos remain coherent. A sufficiently heavy neutrino, approximately 1 keV or so, will separate from the other light neutrinos and thus not be able to participate in oscillations. Below are shown the zenith angle or energy distributions, summed across SK-I through SK-IV, for all the samples in the analysis. Figure 11 shows the \u00b5-like FC, PC, and UP-\u00b5 sub-samples while Fig. 12 shows the e-like and NC\u03c0 0 -like samples. For sub-samples binned in both zenith angle and energy, the projection into only zenith angle is shown. The plots show the data represented by points with statistical error bars as well as the best fits from the two analyses (no-\u03bd e as solid blue and sterile vacuum as dashed red) as well as the MC prediction without sterile neutrinos (represented by a black line), with systematic uncertainties still fit to the data.",
