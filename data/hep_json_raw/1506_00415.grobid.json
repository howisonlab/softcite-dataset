In its first phase the GERDA experiment has yielded a half life limit on this decay of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.1\u202210 25 yr. A background model has been developed. It explains the measured spectrum well, taking into account only components with distances to the detectors less then 2 cm. Competitive limits on Majoron accompanied double beta decay have been derived. Phase II of the experiment, now with additional liquid argon veto installed, is presently starting its commissioning phase. First commissioning spectra from calibration measurements are shown, proving that the liquid argon veto leads to a significant reduction of background events.",

The decay can only occur, if neutrinos have Majorana character, i.e. they are identical with their own antiparticles. 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 -decay can be induced by Lepton number violating, beyond standard model processes. One likely mechanism is the exchange of a light Majorana neutrino. If this is the dominant process leading to 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 decay, information on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos can be derived. In this case the decay rate depends on the neutrino mass,",

Phase I detectors were surrounded with a copper mini shroud in order to mitigate background from 42 K. This was necessary as the 42 Ar (T 1/2 =33 yr) content in natural LAr is higher then expected. Additionally, the daughter isotope, 42 K (T 1/2 =12.4 hr), is ionized directly after the decay and can drift in the electric field surrounding the detectors onto the detector surface or to the close surrounding. This leads to an unacceptably high background if no action is taken. The mini shroud drastically reduces the LAr volume from which 42 K ions can be attracted to the detector surfaces. Additionally the field lines are closed by the grounded mini shroud, further reducing the drift of 42 K ions onto the detectors.",

Also shown is the measured total spectrum in the energy region of interest (RoI) (right). In the latter the total spectrum is displayed with open, while those events surviving a pulse shape cut based on artificial neural networks [8] are displayed by the closed histogram. No evidence for a peak at the Q-value of 76 Ge was found. A frequentist profile likelihood analysis was performed. A lower limit of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.1\u202210 25 yr with a median sensitivity of 2.4\u202210 25 yr was derived [9]. The expected signal with a half life according to the limit is also displayed as the blue line. This result strongly disfavors the positive evidence for observation of 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 decay by parts of the HdM collaboration [10].  [11]. Right: Background spectrum in the energy region of interest No evidence for a peak at 2039 keV is found [9].   A background model was derived using knowledge from screening measurements of the used components [1] and from the visible structures and peaks observed in the measured spectra shown in Fig. 2  [11]. Using a minimum model accounting only for background components resulting from material contaminations in the close vicinity of the detectors (< 2 cm) describes the measured background spectra well. According to this model the background in the RoI for the coax detectors results from 228 Th, 60 Co and 214 Bi in the detector assembly, from 214 Bi on the p+ surface of the detectors, from 42 K in the LAr. Additionally, cosmogenically produced 60 Co in the germanium contributes significantly. The structure of the spectrum above 3 MeV shown in Fig. 3 (left) for the coaxial detectors can be explained by contamination of the coaxial detector p+ surfaces with 210 Po and 226 Ra daughters with additional contribution from 226 Ra daughters in the LAr directly surrounding the detectors, also shown in Fig 3. The latter component does not lead to peak-like structures, rather to a flat distribution extending also to lower energies. This contribution leads to significant background also in the RoI. For the BEGe detectors an additionally component from 42 K on the n+ surface has to be taken into account. Indeed this is the dominant component in the RoI for BEGes, while for coax detectors this contribution is negligible. The difference is explained by the different n+ dead layer thicknesses of BEGes and coaxial detectors. Fig. 3 (right) shows the background decomposition for the BEGe detectors. The background contributions are summarized in Tab. 1.",

The container was transported bewtween US and Europe in the deapest part of the transport ship. During processing, whenever the germanium was not needed. it was stored in shallow depth underground sites. Exposure to cosmic rays was tracked in a dedicated data base.

Tracking the exposure history allowed to make predictions for the 68 Ge and 60 Co concentrations for each individual detector. For June 2015 in total 13.9 and 23.7 68 Ge and 60 Co nuclei are expected per kg of detector material, respectively [5]. All 30 BEGe detectors were subsequently characterized in a vacuum cryostat in the HADES underground lab in Mol, Belgium. The energy resolution (FWHM at 1.3\u1e40eV) of each enriched BEGe is shown as a function of the total detectors mass in Fig. 4. All 30 BEGe detectors had energy resolutions between 1.65 keV and 1.85 keV, significantly better then specified with Canberra before detector production started (<2.3 keV at 1.3 MeV) [5]. Fig. ?? shows the distribution of the A/E parameter [8] for all BEGe events in the \u00b1100 keV energy range around 2039 keV (excluding events in the energy range \u00b110 keV around 2039 keV, as these were blinded when the analysis was made) recorded in Phase I background data together with expected distributions from measurements in a test facility and simulated distributions. It can clearly be seen that the bulk of the events follow the A/E distribution expected for events resulting from the decays of 42 K on the n+ surfaces and can be discriminated with high efficiency from bulk single interaction events.",
