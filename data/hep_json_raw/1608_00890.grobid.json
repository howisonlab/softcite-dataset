The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to a \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair with at least one \u03c4 lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2-1.2 TeV for the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and 0.5-2.5 TeV for the heavy neutral Z boson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in MSSM and Z benchmark scenarios. The most stringent constraints on the MSSM m A -tan \u03b2 space exclude at 95 % confidence level (CL) tan \u03b2 > 7.6 for m A = 200 GeV in the m mod+ h MSSM scenario. For the Sequential Standard Model, a Z SSM mass up to 1.90 TeV is excluded at 95 % CL and masses up to 1.82-2.17 TeV are excluded for a Z SFM of the strong flavour model.",

            "text": "The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [16][17][18][19][20] is the simplest extension of the SM that includes supersymmetry. The MSSM requires two Higgs doublets of opposite hypercharge. Assuming that CP symmetry is conserved, this results in one CP-odd ( A) and two CP-even (h, H ) neutral Higgs bosons and two charged Higgs bosons (H \u00b1 ). At tree level, the properties of the Higgs sector in the MSSM depend on only two non-SM parameters, which can be chosen to be the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson, m A , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets, tan \u03b2. Beyond tree level, additional parameters affect the Higgs sector, the choice of which defines various MSSM benchmark scenarios. In some scenarios, such as m mod+ h [21], the top-squark mixing parameter is chosen such that the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, m h , is close to the measured mass of the Higgs boson that was discovered at the LHC. A different approach is employed in the hMSSM scenario [22,23] in which the value of m h can be used, with certain assumptions, to predict the remaining masses and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons without explicit reference to the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters. The couplings of the MSSM heavy Higgs bosons to down-type fermions are enhanced with respect to the SM for large tan \u03b2 values, resulting in increased branching fractions to \u03c4 leptons and b-quarks, 1 as well as a higher cross section for Higgs boson production in association with b-quarks. This has motivated a variety of searches for a scalar boson in \u03c4 \u03c4 and bb final states at LEP [24], the Tevatron [25][26][27] and the LHC [28][29][30][31][32].",

Such Z bosons can appear in theories extending the electroweak gauge group, where lepton universality is typically conserved. A frequently used benchmark is the sequential standard model (SSM) [39], which contains a single additional Z boson with the same couplings as the SM Z boson. Some models offering an explanation for the high mass of the topquark, predict instead that such bosons couple preferentially to third-generation fermions [40][41][42][43]. A model predicting additional weak gauge bosons Z and W coupling preferentially to third-generation fermions is the strong flavour model (SFM) [41,43].",

The search is performed for the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had decay modes, where \u03c4 lep represents the decay of a \u03c4 lepton to an electron or a muon and neutrinos and \u03c4 had represents the decay to one or more hadrons and a neutrino. The search considers narrow resonances in the mass range of 0.2-1.2 TeV and tan \u03b2 range of 1-60 for the MSSM Higgs bosons. For the Z boson search, the mass range of 0.5-2.5 TeV is considered. Higgs boson production through gluon-gluon fusion and in association with b-quarks is considered (Fig. 1a-c), with the latter mode dominating for high tan \u03b2 values. Hence both the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channels are split into b-tag and b-veto categories, based on the presence or absence of jets originating from bquarks in the final state. Since a Z boson is expected to be predominantly produced via a Drell-Yan process ( Fig. 1d), there is little gain in splitting the data into b-tag and b-veto categories. Hence, the Z analysis uses an inclusive selection instead. 1 Throughout this paper the inclusion of charge-conjugate decay modes is implied. ",

A new innermost layer was added to the pixel tracking detector after the end Run-1 at a radial distance of 3.3 cm from the beam line [49,50]. The ATLAS trigger system consists of a hardware-based first level trigger, followed by a software-based high-level trigger (HLT). The integrated luminosity used in this search, considering the data-taking periods of 2015 in which all relevant detector subsystems were operational, is 3.2 fb \u22121 . The luminosity measurement and its uncertainty are derived following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref.

The masses and the couplings of the Higgs bosons are computed with FeynHiggs [80][81][82][83][84], whereas the branching fraction calculation follows the procedure described in Ref. [85].

For all samples of top-quark production, the spin correlations are preserved and the parton shower, fragmentation and underlying event are simulated using PYTHIA 6.428 [100] with the CTQ6L1 PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune [101]. Final-state QED radiation is simulated using PHOTOS++ v3.52. The topquark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The tt production sample is normalized to the NNLO cross section, including soft-gluon resummation to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (Ref. [102] and references therein).

In this analysis, the fake factors are combined and weighted by the predicted contribution of each background process to the anti-\u03c4 had region: where r MJ denotes the fraction of multi-jet events in the anti\u03c4 had region and r W/tt = 1\u2212r MJ . This neglects the differences between the fake factors for W +jets/tt and other processes, such as Z production. The parameter r MJ is estimated, separately for the b-veto and b-tag categories, in two steps using a data-driven method. First, the rates at which jets are misidentified as electrons or muons are measured from the ratio of leptons passing and failing the lepton isolation requirement in a region enriched in multi-jet events. This multi-jet control region is defined in Table 1. The predicted multi-jet rate is then applied to events in the anti-\u03c4 had sub-region that also fail the lepton isolation, in order to calculate r MJ as a function of \u03c4 had\u2212vis p T separately for the \u03c4 e \u03c4 had and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 had channels. When the fake factor is applied to the anti-\u03c4 had sub-region events, the contributions from correctly identified \u03c4 had\u2212vis and from electrons and muons misidentified as \u03c4 had\u2212vis candidates are subtracted using the default MC simulation described in Sect. 2. Background processes where the electron or the muon is identified as a \u03c4 had\u2212vis object are modelled using simulation. The main source of such backgrounds is Z (\u2192 ee)+jets events in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 had channel, which are reduced using the m vis (e, \u03c4 had ) mass-window veto described in Sect. 4.1. To account for mismodelling of electrons misidentified as \u03c4 had\u2212vis objects in Z \u2192 ee+jets events, the simulation is corrected as a function of the lepton \u03b7 using data control regions defined by reversing the mass-window criterion, as listed in Table 1. The correction amounts to 15 % for threetrack \u03c4 had\u2212vis , while for the one-track \u03c4 had\u2212vis objects the correction varies from 20 % in the barrel region to up to 200 % in the end-cap region.",

In the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel, the combined fake-factor method includes uncertainties in the W +jets/tt fake factors, the multi-jet fake factors, and the r MJ estimation. For the W +jets fake factors the main uncertainties arise from the dependence on \u03c6(\u03c4 had\u2212vis , E miss T ), from the difference between the relative contributions of quark-and gluon-initiated jets faking \u03c4 had\u2212vis in the control region and the signal region, and from the contamination by backgrounds other than W +jets in the control region, which are estimated using simulation. The uncertainty is parameterized as a function of the anti-\u03c4 had\u2212vis p T and amounts approximately to 17 % for jets misidentified as one-track \u03c4 candidates and varies between 16 and 34 % for jets misidentified as three-track \u03c4 candidates. Uncertainties related to non-W +jets events were studied and have no significant impact on the fake-factor determination. For the multi-jet fake factors and r MJ , the uncertainty is dominated by the number of data events in the control region and the subtraction of the remaining nonmulti-jet backgrounds using simulation. Typical values of the total uncertainties for r MJ are between 7 and 20 % and for the multi-jet fake factors between 10 and 20 %, depending on the channel and the \u03c4 had\u2212vis candidate p T . In addition, the effect on the background estimate due to the anti\u03c4 had region definition is examined. The loose \u03c4 had\u2212vis identification requirement used in the definition of this region is varied to estimate the corresponding uncertainty, which is 5 and 1 % in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 had and the \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 had channel, respectively.",

Uncertainties due to the initial-and final-state radiation, as well as multiple parton interaction for the signal are also taken into account. These uncertainties are estimated from the PYTHIA8 A14 tune [61] for the b-associated production and the AZNLO PYTHIA8 tune [60] for the gluongluon fusion production. The envelope of the variations resulting from the use of the alternative PDFs in the PDF4LHC15_nlo_100 [127] set is used in order to estimate the PDF uncertainty for gluon-gluon fusion production. For the b-associated production uncertainty, a comparison among NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118_nf_4 [127], CT14nlo_NF4 [58], MSTW2008nlo68cl_nf4 [128] and CT10_nlo_nf4 [57] PDF sets is employed.

Hence, the value \u03bc = 0 corresponds to the absence of a signal, whereas the value \u03bc = 1 indicates the presence of a signal as predicted by the theoretical model under study. To estimate \u03bc, a likelihood function constructed as the product of Poisson probability terms is used. Signal and background predictions depend on systematic uncertainties, which are parameterized as nuisance parameters and are constrained using Gaussian probability distributions. For the MSSM Higgs boson search a binned likelihood function is constructed in bins of the m tot T distributions, chosen to ensure sufficient background statistics in each bin. The search for a Z boson is a counting experiment, summing the number of events above a certain m tot T threshold. The threshold is chosen for each Z mass hypothesis to maximize the expected significance and ranges from 400 GeV at low Z mass to 750 GeV at high Z mass. The asymptotic approximation is used with the test statistic q \u03bc [129] to test the compatibility of the data with the assumed signal.",

            "text": "figure, lines of constant m h and m H are shown. For the hMSSM scenario, the exclusion arising from the SM Higgs boson coupling measurements of Ref.[131] is also shown, in addition to the ATLAS Run-1 H/A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 search result of Ref.[28]. The tan \u03b2 constraints in the hMSSM scenario are stronger than those in the m mod+ h scenario. This is due to the presence of low-mass neutralinos in the m mod+ h scenario that reduce the H/A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 branching fraction and which are absent in the hMSSM scenario. In the hMSSM scenario, the most stringent constraints on tan \u03b2 for the combined search exclude tan \u03b2 > 7.1 for m A = 200 GeV and tan \u03b2 > 39 for m A = 1 TeV at the 95 % CL. In the MSSM m mod+ h scenario, the 95 % CL upper limits exclude tan \u03b2 > 7.6 for m A = 200 GeV and tan \u03b2 > 47 for m A = 1 TeV. The feature of the expected limits in the hMSSM scenario exclusion plot at around m A = 350 GeV is due to the behaviour of the branching ratio A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 close to the A \u2192 tt kinematic threshold. Some sensitivity of the search is also expected around tan \u03b2 \u223c 1, m A \u223c 200 GeV due to the increase of the gluon-gluon fusion cross section induced by the increased coupling to the top quark.In the search for the Z boson, the observed number of events in the signal regions of the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channels are consistent with the SM predictions. The resulting 95% CL upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction as a function of the mass and shown inFig. 6a. These results are interpreted in the context of the SSM and SFM inFig. 6a, b, respectively. The resulting observed (expected) lower limit on the mass of the Z SSM boson is 1.90 (1.84) TeV. In the search for the Z SFM boson, results are presented as a function of sin 2 \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the mixing angle between the two SU(2) gauge eigenstates of the model. Masses below 1.82-2.17 TeV are excluded in the range 0.1 < sin 2 \u03c6 < 0.5, assuming no \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 mixing. For the value of sin 2 \u03c6 = 0.03, the lower limit on the mass of a Z SFM boson is 2.12 TeV, extending the limits from previous direct and indirect searches by more than 200 GeV.",
