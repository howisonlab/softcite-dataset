            "text": "According to the well-established \u039b CDM model of cosmology, known matter only comprises about 5% of the total energy content of the universe, with 27% contributed by dark matter (DM) and the rest being dark energy [1]. Although strong astrophysical evidence indicates the existence of DM, there is no evidence yet for nongravitational interactions between DM and standard model (SM) particles. DM searches exploit a number of methods including direct detection [2] and indirect detection [3]. If there are DM particles that can be observed in direct detection experiments, they could have substantial couplings to nucleons, and therefore could be produced at the CERN LHC. A theoretically promising possibility is that DM may take the form of weakly interacting massive particles. Searches for production of such particles at colliders typically consider the case of DM recoiling against a standard model particle (\"tag\") to obtain a defined signature [4]. Such searches have been performed using various standard model signatures as tags [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. In models where DM production is mediated by an interaction involving SM quarks, the monojet signature is typically the most sensitive. If DM particles are instead produced via radiation emitted by a standard model boson, searches in the Z/W/\u03b3 + E miss T channels are advantageous.",

A previous CMS search in the same final state [17], based on data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, found no evidence of new physics and set limits on DM and unparticle production using an EFT description. A CMS analysis of the 8 TeV data set in the combined monojet and hadronic mono-V (where V = W or Z) JHEP03(2017)061 channels [19] has previously set limits on the simplified model parameters considered here. Dark matter particle masses of up to 500 GeV (400 GeV) and mediator masses of up to 1.6 TeV have been excluded in the vector (axial-vector) coupling scenarios for g q = g DM = 1. A search performed by the ATLAS Collaboration using \u221a s = 13 TeV data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 in events with a hadronically decaying V boson and E miss T has recently reported exclusion of the dimension-7 EFT scenario up to \u039b = 700 GeV (460 GeV) for DM particle masses of 1 GeV (1 TeV) [20].",

Under this assumption, the width is in the range 1-5% (30-50%) of the mediator mass for g q = 0.25 (g q = 1.00). The signal simulation samples with g q = 1.0 are processed using the detector simulation described below. Signal predictions for g q = 0.25 are obtained by applying event weights based on the E miss T distribution at the generator level to the fully simulated samples with g q = 1.0.

These scale factors are of order 1.0-1.2. The control region is defined by applying the full selection with the E miss T requirement inverted. The reliability of this approach in the high-E miss T regime has been studied by considering variables sensitive to E miss T mismeasurement, such as the angular separation between the E miss T direction and any jet.

While the influence on the estimated signal acceptance arising from theoryrelated uncertainties is included in the limit calculation, the corresponding effect on the normalization of the signal process is not. For the simplified model of DM production, the effect of the signal normalization uncertainty is treated separately from the experimental uncertainty and is shown as a dashed band around the observed limit. Since the EFT benchmark and unparticle scenarios are extremely simplified, theory-related cross-section uncertainties are not considered to be realistic for these models and are thus neglected. The efficiencies for signal, ZZ, and WZ processes are estimated using simulation, and the uncertainties in the corresponding yields are derived by varying the renormalization and factorization scales, \u03b1 S , and choice of PDFs.

Independent of the type of coupling, production of DM particles via an on-shell mediator (2m \u03c7 < M med ) can be excluded up to mediator masses of \u2248400 GeV for g q = 1.0 and up to \u2248300 GeV for g q = 0.25. Dark matter particle masses are probed up to 100-150 GeV for vector and up to 50-100 GeV for axial-vector couplings. For g q = 1.0, a small region of off-shell parameter space can also be excluded. In the case of g q = 0.25, sensitivity is limited to the on-shell region. 12.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b1 1.0 18.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b1 1.5 tt/tW/WW/Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 7.0 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 1.9 14.0 \u00b1 2.
