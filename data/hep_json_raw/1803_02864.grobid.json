The search considers final states with an electron or a muon, one or two \u03c4 leptons that decayed to hadrons, and additional jets. The data were collected in 2016 in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No evidence for pair production of LQs is found. Assuming a branching fraction of unity for the decay LQ \u2192 t\u03c4 , upper limits on the production cross section are set as a function of LQ mass, excluding masses below 900 GeV at 95% confidence level. These results provide the most stringent limits to date on the production of scalar LQs that decay to a top quark and a \u03c4 lepton.",

            "text": "Leptoquarks (LQs) are hypothetical particles that carry nonzero baryon and lepton quantum numbers. They are charged under all standard model (SM) gauge groups, and their possible quantum numbers can be restricted by the assumption that their interactions with SM fermions are renormalizable and gauge invariant [1]. The spin of an LQ state is either 0 (scalar LQ) or 1 (vector LQ). Leptoquarks appear in theories beyond the SM such as grand unified theories [2][3][4], technicolor models [5,6] and other compositeness scenarios [7,8], and Rparity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric models [9,10].",

These decay rates deviate from the SM predictions by about four standard deviations [17], and studies of the flavor structure of LQ couplings reveal that large couplings to third-generation quarks and leptons could explain this anomaly [18][19][20][21]. Third-generation LQs e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch can appear in models in which only third-generation quarks and leptons are unified [22,23] and therefore their existence is not constrained by proton decay experiments. All models that predict LQs with masses at the TeV scale and sizable couplings to top quarks and \u03c4 leptons can be probed by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC.",

There are also lepton-mediated t-and u-channel contributions that depend on the unknown lepton-quark-LQ Yukawa coupling, but these contributions to LQ 3 production are negligible at the LHC as they require third-generation quarks in the initial state. Hence, the LQ pair-production cross section can be taken to depend only on the assumed values of the LQ spin and mass, and on the center-of-mass energy. The corresponding pair production cross sections have been calculated up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD [24].",

A previous search for this channel at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the CMS Collaboration resulted in a lower mass limit of 685 GeV for an LQ 3 with branching fraction B = 1 into a top quark and a \u03c4 lepton [25].

            "text": "We consider events with at least one electron or muon and at least one \u03c4 lepton, where the \u03c4 lepton undergoes a one-or three-prong hadronic decay, \u03c4 h \u2192 hadron(s) + \u03bd \u03c4 . In LQ 3 LQ 3 events, \u03c4 leptons arise directly from LQ 3 decays, as well as from W bosons in the top quark decay chain. Electrons and muons are produced in leptonic decays of W bosons or \u03c4 leptons. Two search regions are used in this analysis: a di-\u03c4 region with the signature \u03c4 h \u03c4 h +jets and small background levels from SM processes, which provides high sensitivity for LQ 3 masses below 500 GeV, and a region with a single \u03c4 lepton in the final state, \u03c4 h +jets, which has higher sensitivity for LQ 3 masses above 500 GeV because of a larger signal efficiency. Here, denotes either an electron or a muon. The dominant backgrounds in this search come from tt+jets and W + jets production, with jets misidentified as hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. These backgrounds are estimated through measurements in control regions and extrapolated to the signal region. In this paper, Sect. 2 describes the CMS detector, while Sect. 3 discusses the data samples and the properties of simulated events utilized in the analysis. Section 4 outlines the techniques used for event reconstruction and Sect. 5 describes the selection criteria applied in each analysis channel. The method used for the background estimation is reported in Sect. 6, and systematic uncertainties are detailed in Sect. 7. Finally, Sect. 8 contains the results of the analysis, and Sect. 9 summarizes this work.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Electron momenta are estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [40].",

These processes are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo (v2.2.2), with W boson production at NLO and Z boson production at LO level. The matrix element generation of W and Z boson production is matched to the parton shower emissions with the Frederix and Frixione [51] and MLM [52] algorithms, respectively. Background processes from QCD multijet production are simulated with pythia 8.205. For all generated events, pythia 8.205 is used for the description of the parton shower and hadronization. In the parton shower, the underlying event tune CUETP8M1 [53,54] has been applied for all samples except for tt and single top quark production in the t-channel, which use the underlying event tune CUETP8M2T4 [53,54].

For all jets, corrections based on the jet area [64] are applied to the energy of the jets to remove the energy contributions from neutral hadrons from additional pp interactions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup collisions). Subsequent corrections are used to account for the nonlinear calorimetric response in both jet energy and mass, as a function of \u03b7 and p T [65]. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV [66]. Corrections to the jet energy scale and the jet energy resolution are propagated to the determination of the missing transverse momentum [66]. Jets associated with b quarks are identified using the combined secondary vertex v2 algorithm [67,68].

Uncertainties in the MC simulation are applied to all simulated events used in the signal and in the various control regions. For each systematic uncertainty, the background estimation procedure described in Sect. 6 is repeated to study the impact of the respective systematic variation on the final result of the analysis. In the following, the systematic uncertainties applied to the analysis are summarized. -Various uncertainties in the \u03c4 lepton reconstruction are considered. An uncertainty of 5% in the \u03c4 lepton identification is applied, with an additional uncertainty of 0.2 p T /(1 TeV). An uncertainty of 3% in the \u03c4 lepton energy scale is taken into account, and an uncertainty in the charge misidentification rate of 2% is applied [70]. -Parton distribution functions from the NNPDF 3.0 set are used to generate simulated events for both background and signal samples. The uncertainties in the PDFs are determined according to the procedure described in Ref. [81]. The associated PDF uncertainties in the signal acceptance are estimated following the prescription for the LHC [81]. -We consider uncertainties in the renormalization (\u03bc R ) and factorization (\u03bc F ) scales by varying the respective scales, both simultaneously and independently, by factors between 0.5 and 2. -We apply an uncertainty in the background estimation method by varying the extrapolation factors for background processes without \u03c4 leptons within their uncertainties.
