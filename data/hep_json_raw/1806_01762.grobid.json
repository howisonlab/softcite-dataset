            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations is a major milestone in high-energy physics [1,2]. However, the underlying nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unknown. Naturalness arguments [3] require that, to avoid fine-tuning, quadratic divergences arising from radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass are cancelled out by one or more new particles. Several such mechanisms have been proposed in theories beyond the Standard Model. In supersymmetry, the cancellation comes from assigning superpartners to the Standard Model (SM) bosons and fermions. Alternatively, Little Higgs [4,5] and Composite Higgs [6,7] models introduce a spontaneously JHEP08(2018)048 broken global symmetry, with the Higgs boson emerging as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson [8]. These latter models predict the existence of vector-like quarks (VLQs), defined as colour-triplet spin-1/2 fermions whose left-and right-handed chiral components have the same transformation properties under the weak-isospin SU(2) gauge group [9,10]. Depending on the model, vector-like quarks are produced in SU(2) singlets, doublets, or triplets of flavours T , B, Y or X, in which the first two have the same charge as the SM top quark and b-quark while the vector-like Y and X quarks have charge 1 \u22124/3 and +5/3, respectively. In addition, in these models, VLQs are expected to couple preferentially to third-generation quarks [9,11] and can have flavour-changing neutral-current decays at leading order in addition to the charged-current decays characteristic of chiral quarks. As a result, an up-type T quark can decay not only into a W boson and a b-quark, but also into a Z or Higgs boson and a top quark (T \u2192 W b, Zt, and Ht). Similarly, a down-type B quark can decay into a Z or Higgs boson and a b-quark, in addition to decaying into a W boson and a top quark (B \u2192 W t, Zb, and Hb). For each type, the sum of the three branching fractions is assumed to be 1, i.e. other decays are not considered. Due to their charge, vector-like Y quarks can only decay into W b while vector-like X quarks must decay into W t. To be consistent with the results from precision electroweak measurements, the mass-splitting between VLQs belonging to the same SU(2) multiplet is required to be small, but no requirement is placed on which member of the doublet is heavier [12]. Cascade decays such as T \u2192 W B \u2192 W W t are thus assumed to be kinematically forbidden. Decays of VLQs into final states with first-and second-generation quarks, although not favoured, are not excluded by precision electroweak or flavour measurements [13,14].",

Contrary to single production the BB pair-production cross section depends only on the B quark mass. An example of a leading-order production diagram is shown in figure 1. Previous searches in this decay mode by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations did not observe a significant deviation from the SM predictions. Those searches excluded VLQ masses below 740 GeV for any combination of branching ratios and below 1020 GeV for the assumption of B(B \u2192 W t) = 1 [15,16]. A recent search by the ATLAS Collaboration at \u221a s = 13 TeV, primarily targeting the T quark decaying into W b, was also found to be sensitive to B and X quarks decaying into W t. The results included interpretations which provide a 95% confidence-level observed (expected) lower limit on the B quark mass at 1250 (1150) GeV assuming a 100% branching ratio to W t; in the SU(2) singlet scenario, the limit is 1080 (980) GeV [17]. In this context, the event selection for this new search is optimised for high-mass BB production with subsequent decay into two high-p T W bosons and two top quarks, where one of the four W bosons decays leptonically and the others decay hadronically. To suppress the SM background, boosted-jet reconstruction techniques [18,19] are used to improve the identification of hadronically decaying high-p T 1 All electric charges are quoted in units of e.",

The second, more inclusive, signal region uses a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) to discriminate between SM and VLQ events. Finally, a profile likelihood fit is used to test for the presence of a VLQ signal as a function of the B quark mass and the decay branching ratios.

Simulated BB signal events were generated with the leading-order (LO) generator Protos v2.2 [24] using the NNPDF2.3 [25] LO parton distribution function (PDF) set and a set of tuned parameters called the A14 tune [26] and were passed to Pythia 8.186 [27] for the underlying-event description, parton showering, and fragmentation. The samples were generated for an SU(2) singlet B VLQ, but with equal branching ratios of the B quark to each final state. To check the dependence of the results on the weak-isospin of the VLQ, one sample was also generated using the SU(2) (T B) doublet model including only the B contributions. The signal samples are normalised to pair-production cross-sections computed using Top++ v2.0 [28], including next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections and soft-gluon resummation to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy [29][30][31][32][33][34], and using the MSTW 2008 NNLO PDF set [35]. Their cross-sections vary from 3.38 \u00b1 0.25 pb (m B = 500 GeV) to 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 fb (m B = 2000 GeV). Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated from variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as from uncertainties in the PDFs and \u03b1 S . The latter two represent the largest contribution to the overall theoretical uncertainty in the signal cross-sections and are calculated using the PDF4LHC [36] prescription with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO [37,38] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN PDF sets [25]. Two benchmark signal scenarios are considered, along with a full scan of the branching-ratio plane. The first benchmark corresponds to a B quark that decays 100% into W t and the second corresponds to the SU(2) singlet B quark scenario, which predicts branching ratios of \u223c50%, \u223c25%, \u223c25% to W t, Zb and Hb, respectively [12].",

The diagram removal method was used to remove the overlap between NLO W t production and LO tt production [45].

The alternative tt generator samples were processed with a fast simulation [56] of the ATLAS detector with parameterised showers in the calorimeters. Simulated events were then reconstructed with the same software as used for the data. Multiple overlaid pp collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pile-up) were simulated at rates matching those in the data; they were modelled as low-p T multi-jet production using the Pythia 8.186 generator and the A2 tune [57].

Jets containing b-hadrons are identified via an algorithm that uses multivariate techniques to combine information from the impact parameters of displaced tracks as well as topological properties of secondary and tertiary decay vertices reconstructed within the jet [64,65]. A jet is considered b-tagged if the value for the multivariate discriminant is above the threshold corresponding to an efficiency of 77% for tagging a jet containing bhadrons.

The jet energy and pseudorapidity are further calibrated to account for residual detector effects using energy-and pseudorapidity-dependent calibration factors derived from simulation. The k t -based trimming algorithm reclusters the jet constituents into subjets with a more finely grained resolution with an R-parameter set to R sub = 0.2. Subjets that contribute less than 5% to the p T of the large-R jets are discarded. The properties (e.g. transverse momentum and invariant mass) of the jet are recalculated using only the constituents of the remaining subjets. Trimmed large-R jets are only considered if they have p T > 200 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. No dedicated overlap-removal procedure between large-R and small-R jets is performed. To identify large-R jets that are likely to have originated from the hadronic decay of W bosons (W had ), jet substructure information is exploited using both the ratio of the energy correlation functions D \u03b2=1 2 [68,69] and the combined jet mass [70]. The combined jet mass is constructed using a combination of the calorimeterderived jet mass, based on calorimeter cell cluster constituents, and the track-assisted jet mass, where the calorimeter momentum is augmented by information from the tracks associated with the large-R jet. Selected large-R jets must pass both the substructure and mass requirements of the 50%-efficient W -tagging working point [18]. To reduce the contribution from the tt background, W had candidates must not overlap any b-tagged small-R jets within \u2206R < 0.75.",

The W lep is paired with a large-R jet to form the semileptonically decaying VLQ candidate. Two additional large-R jets are combined to form the hadronically decaying VLQ candidate. All possible large-R jet JHEP08(2018)048 permutations are tested and the pairing that minimises the absolute value of the mass difference between the semileptonically and hadronically reconstructed VLQ candidates, |\u2206m|, is chosen. It should be noted that in cases where the lepton originates from the decay of a top quark, the reconstruction described above neglects the presence of the additional b-jet.

It contains events with less than three large-R jets and thus it is not possible to reconstruct the full BB system from the reconstructed objects alone. As a result, a BDT as implemented in the toolkit for multivariate data analysis with ROOT (TMVA) [74] is used to discriminate between potential signal and background events. For training and testing, a set of signal simulation samples assuming B(B \u2192 W t) = 1 is used, combining signal masses ranging from 1050 GeV to 1600 GeV. Simulated tt events are used as background in the training, as they are the dominant background contribution in this region. Starting from a list of 75 variables describing the kinematics of the event, individual variables are removed through an iterative process and the performance of the BDT is evaluated, until a final set of 20 variables is selected. The procedure for removing variables is based on a combination of poor separation power, or high correlation with a variable with higher separation power, particularly if the correlation is similar between signal and background. Variables with poor agreement between data and simulation are also rejected. The 20 remaining input variables are well modelled by the JHEP08(2018)048 simulation. The selected variables describe the global event characteristics as well as the kinematics and angular separation of the reconstructed objects. The five highest-ranked variables are: S T , the invariant mass of the highest-p T large-R jet, the sphericity of the event, 3 \u2206R between the lepton and the sub-leading small-R jet, and \u2206R between the leading b-tagged jet and the leading large-R jet.",

This selection is also used to determine the ratio of the multi-jet production to the small simulation-derived backgrounds. The ratio is then assumed to be the same in the RECOSR and is used to scale those small simulationderived backgrounds to account for the additional contribution from multi-jet backgrounds. This scaling was found to be stable under small changes to the definition of the looser selection.

Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state and no significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. Assuming a branching ratio B(B \u2192 W t) = 1, the observed (expected) 95% CL lower limit on the vector-like quark mass is 1350 GeV (1330 GeV). For the scenario of an SU(2) singlet B quark, the observed (expected) mass limit is 1170 GeV (1140 GeV). Assuming the B quark can only decay into W t, Zb and Hb, 95% CL lower limits are derived for various masses in the two-dimensional plane of B(B \u2192 W t) versus B(B \u2192 Hb).
