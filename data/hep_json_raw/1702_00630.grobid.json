The measurements cover a broad transverse momentum range, 1 < p T < 100 GeV/c. The analysis focuses on the p T > 10 GeV/c range, where anisotropic azimuthal distributions should reflect the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the created medium. Results are presented in several bins of PbPb collision centrality, spanning the 60% most central events. The v 2 coefficient is measured with the scalar product and the multiparticle cumulant methods, which have different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. The values from both methods remain positive up to p T \u223c 60-80 GeV/c, in all examined centrality classes. The v 3 coefficient, only measured with the scalar product method, tends to zero for p T 20 GeV/c. Comparisons between theoretical calculations and data provide new constraints on the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions and highlight the importance of the initial-state fluctuations.",

            "text": "Several observations made at RHIC in AuAu collisions at centerof-mass energy per nucleon pair \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [1][2][3][4] and at the LHC in PbPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV [5][6][7][8][9][10] establish that high-energy partons lose a significant fraction of their energy while traversing the hot and dense medium created in these collisions. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor (R AA ), a ratio that quantifies the modification of particle spectra between pp and heavy ion collisions, show a large suppression of high transverse-momentum (p T ) charged hadrons at RHIC [11][12][13][14][15][16] and at LHC [7][8][9][10]. Also, a strong asymmetry is observed in the energies of the two jets in dijet events in PbPb collisions [5,6]. These observations have triggered much progress in the understanding of jet quenching phenomena, but do not provide sufficient information for a detailed understanding of how the parton energy loss depends on the distance traversed by the partons in the medium. The study of anisotropies in the azimuthal angle distributions of high-p T hadrons can provide revealing information that is complementary to previous measurements. These anisotropies are characterized by the v n coefficients of a Fourier expansion in E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch.",

Such studies have been performed at RHIC [18] and at the LHC [19][20][21] up to p T \u2248 10 and 60 GeV/c, respectively. Most jet quenching models are unable to simultaneously reproduce the R AA and v 2 measurements [22][23][24]. Nevertheless, recent attempts to solve this puzzle have shown promise by considering initial-state collision geometry asymmetries and fluctuations [25,26], which are predicted to strongly affect the high-p T v n coefficients, but not the R AA values. In particular, the fluctuations generate odd harmonics [27] and the measurement of the v 3 coefficient up to very high p T is expected to clarify the importance of considering initial-state fluctuations in the modeling of parton energy loss [25,26]. In this Letter, the azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV is measured up to p T \u2248 100 GeV/c. The scalar product (SP) method [28,29] is used to determine the v 2 and v 3 coefficients as a function of p T and collision centrality in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1. The unprecedented statistical reach of the \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV PbPb sample for high-p T particles allows for the first precise measurement of the v 2 and v 3 coefficients at high p T . Furthermore, v 2 is also measured with the multiparticle cumulant analysis method [30], using 4-, 6-and 8-particle correlations. ",

Within the solenoid volume there are a silicon pixel and strip tracker detector, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within |\u03b7| < 2.5 and provides a p T resolution of about 1.5% for 100 GeV charged particles. Furthermore, the track impact parameter resolution is about 25-90  \u03bcm in the transverse (longitudinal) dimension, depending on \u03b7 and p T [31]. Iron and quartz-fiber Cherenkov hadron forward (HF) calorimeters cover the range 2.9 < |\u03b7| < 5.2 on either side of the interaction region. The granularity of the HF towers is \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.175 \u00d7 0.175 radians, allowing an accurate reconstruction of the heavy ion event plane. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [32]. The detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the CMS detector response is based on Geant4 [33].",

Events were collected with several trigger algorithms, composed of a hardware-based level 1 (L1) trigger, followed by a software-based high-level trigger (HLT). The p T region up to 14 GeV/c is covered by a minimum-bias trigger, which requires energy deposits in both HF calorimeters above a predefined threshold of approximately 1 GeV. This minimum-bias trigger was prescaled during data taking. To extend the measurement to higher order coefficients and higher p T (e.g., up to 100 GeV/c), a dedicated trigger that selects events containing a high-p T particle was used. The L1 trigger requirement was based on the transverse energy (E T ) of the highest E T calorimeter region ( \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.348 \u00d7 0.348) in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.044). In the HLT farm, a fast version of the offline tracking algorithms was employed and the highest p T track was required to pass the strict selection criteria described hereafter, resulting in a trigger efficiency of nearly 100%. Different E T and p T thresholds [10] were used at L1 and HLT, respectively, to enrich the data sample with events that contain high-p T tracks.",

The real part is taken for all averages of Q -vector products over the events. Azimuthal asymmetries that arise from the acceptance and other detector-related effects are taken into account using a two-step process, where the Q -vector is first recentered and subsequently flattened [39]. These corrections and their effects on the results are negligible for the CMS detector. Since the measurements include correlations between low-and high-p T particles, the recently established event-plane decorrelation effect [40] cannot be neglected. It is expected to reduce the v n values in comparison to those determined if the event planes would be established exclusively using high-p T particles. The model calculations that include fluctuations in the initial state take into account this effect [26].",

Therefore, the v 2 systematic uncertainties, expressed in terms of relative values in %, are applied to v 3 , with the exception of the uncertainties due to the few-particle correlations, discussed below. The systematic uncertainties due to the vertex position selection and to the p T dependence of the tracking efficiency corrections are common to the SP and cumulant analyses. They are found to be less than 1% and independent of p T and centrality. The systematic uncertainties due to misreconstructed tracks are derived by changing the track selection criteria. The results are found to depend on p T but not centrality, and are also different for the cumulant and SP methods. The track selection uncertainties have been found to gradually increase from \u223c 2% at low p T to \u223c 50% for p T > 60 GeV/c for the SP method, and from \u223c 2% to \u223c 2% for the cumulant analysis.

A key difference between these two models is that the SHEE framework includes initial-state geometry fluctuations, while CUJET3.0 uses a smooth hydrodynamic background. The CUJET3.0 model uses perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations to describe the hard parton interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), complemented by a perfect-fluid hydrodynamic expansion of the medium. The SHEE calculations use viscous hydrodynamics including eventby-event fluctuations in the soft sector [26,45,46], in addition to an energy loss model [26,47,48]. They are performed with a low shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (\u03b7/s), less than or equal to 0.12 (although higher values do not affect the high-p T predictions), a chemical freezout temperature of 160 MeV, and a linear path-length dependence of the energy loss inspired by pQCD, similar to that in CUJET3.0. In addition, both model calculations are only valid for p T > 10 GeV/c. Over the full centrality range, the CUJET3.0 calculations describe qualitatively the trend observed in the v 2 data for p T > 10 GeV/c, but fail to quantitatively reproduce the results. For instance, in the centrality range 0-30% and for 10 < p T < 40 GeV/c, v 2 is overestimated by 10-50%, while the model largely underestimates it in the peripheral bins. The SHEE calculations of both v 2 and v 3 are in good agreement with the data for p T > 10 GeV/c over the full centrality range. The success of the SHEE framework suggests that modeling the initial-state fluctuations may be a crucial ingredient to describe the experimental data related to parton energy loss. Although not shown in the figure, a scenario in the SHEE framework with a quadratic path-length dependence of the energy loss, inspired by gauge-gravity duality [49,50], was also tested and seen to disagree with the data. As just one example, this alternative pathlength dependence is found to overestimate the data by 30-40% for p T > 20 GeV/c in the 20-30% centrality range.",

At higher p T , the difference between SP and multiparticle cumulant results shows a tendency to decrease. Nevertheless, the uncertainties are too large to draw a firm conclusion. This tendency might be due to p T dependence of flow vector fluctuations, which depends on the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio of the medium [26,54]. Therefore, the results presented in Fig. 2 provide important information to constrain the QGP shear viscosity in PbPb collisions. Fig. 3 shows the correlation between high-p T and low-p T v 2 values, for investigating the connection between the azimuthal anisotropies induced by hydrodynamic flow and the path-length dependence of parton energy loss [25,26]. The most peripheral  to be compatible within statistical uncertainties and to decrease when selecting higher p T particles.

A model calculation (SHEE) incorporating initialstate fluctuations with a linear path-length dependence of parton energy loss is found to be in good agreement with the data, over the wide p T and centrality ranges probed in this analysis.
