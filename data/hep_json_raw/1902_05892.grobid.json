The differential cross-section is measured for events containing two same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pairs. It exhibits a rich structure, with different mass regions dominated in the Standard Model by single Z boson production, Higgs boson production, and Z boson pair production, and nonnegligible interference effects at high invariant masses. The measurement is compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, which are found to be consistent with the data. These calculations are used to interpret the data in terms of gg \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 and Z \u2192 4 subprocesses, and to place constraints on a possible contribution from physics beyond the Standard Model.",

An analysis using \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV data [8] to determine the Z \u2192 4 branching fraction has also been published by ATLAS.

[3] and denoted by D ME in this paper) designed to distinguish the s-channel Higgs-mediated production process from all other processes.

Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7).

The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and includes three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector. The MS is based on a system of precision chambers providing tracking information up to |\u03b7| = 2.7 and fast detectors for triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [14]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and processes a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 100 kHz.

This background is negligible within the phase space of this measurement. The full list of selection criteria is given in table 1 and largely follows refs. [16,17]. The overall range in m 4 considered for this measurement is 70 GeV < m 4 < 1200 GeV and was chosen based on the yields predicted in MC simulation. All candidates observed in the collision data fall into this interval.",

The value of 0.1 is chosen to keep the peak of the distribution sufficiently distant from the maximum possible value of 0 while also limiting tails in the negative direction. The numerator represents the s-channel matrix element involving the Higgs boson produced via gluon-gluon fusion. The squared matrix elements are computed at leading-order QCD precision using the MCFM [18] program version 8.0. The strong coupling constant is evaluated at the scale of half the four-lepton invariant mass. The Higgs boson mass is set to m H = 125.0 GeV, and its width to the Standard Model prediction for this mass.

It must not contain more than one muon identified solely in the calorimeter or solely in the muon spectrometer. None of the leptons constituting the quadruplet may have a transverse impact parameter significance d 0 /\u03c3 d 0 > 5 (3) for electrons (muons). All leptons of the quadruplet are required to satisfy isolation criteria based on particle-tracks measured in the inner detector and energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter. When evaluating these criteria, tracks or deposits originating from leptons in the quadruplet are not considered in order to retain events with close-by prompt leptons. Finally, the four leptons of the quadruplet are required to be loosely compatible with originating from a common vertex, evaluated by means of the reduced-\u03c7 2 vertex fit using the four lepton trajectories.

It was modelled using Sherpa 2.2.2 [43], at LO precision for zeroand one-jet final states, and the NNPDF3.0NNLO PDF set was chosen. This sample includes the box diagram, the s-channel process proceeding via a Higgs boson, and the interference between the two. Recently, a NLO QCD calculation for the three components became available [44,45] allowing m 4 differential K-factors to be calculated with the 1/m t expansion below 2m t , and assuming a massless quark approximation above this threshold. This NLO QCD calculation was used to correct the s-channel process gg \u2192 H * \u2192 ZZ ( * ) \u2192 4 , the box diagram gg \u2192 4 and the interference with separate K-factors. These represent significant corrections of the order of +100% to the leading-order cross-section. There are, however, NNLO QCD precision calculations for the off-shell Higgs boson production cross-section [46,47] which show additional enhancement of the cross-section. Since these corrections are not known differentially in m 4 for all three components, the prediction for each component is scaled by an additional overall correction factor of 1.2, assumed to be the same for the signal, background and interference. This additional constant scale factor is justified by the approximately constant behaviour of the NNLO/NLO QCD prediction. In addition, a purely leading-order prediction for the gg \u2192 4 process was obtained using the MCFM program [18] with the CT10 PDF set [40], interfaced to Pythia 8 [41,42].",

In the case of the box diagram, the same combination of NLO QCD K-factor and a factor of 1.2 to account for higher-order effects, as described above, is applied to correct the cross-section. The Higgs production processes via gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) [48] (which dominates the on-shell Higgs production), via vector-boson fusion (VBF) [49] and in association with a vector boson (V H) [50] were all simulated at NLO precision in QCD using Powheg-Box v2 with the PDF4LHC next-to-leading-order (NLO) set of parton distribution functions [51] and interfaced to Pythia 8.186. The decay of the Higgs and Z bosons was performed within Pythia. The description of the gluon-gluon fusion process was further improved by reweighting to NNLO QCD accuracy using the HNNLO program [52][53][54], referred to as the NNLOPS method [55], and the resulting prediction was normalised using cross-sections calculated at N3LO precision in QCD [47]. For VBF production, full NLO QCD and EW calculations were used with approximate NNLO QCD corrections. The VH production was calculated at NNLO in QCD and NLO EW corrections are applied. Production in association with a top-quark pair was simulated to NLO accuracy in QCD using MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [56,57] configured with the CT10 PDF set and interfaced to Herwig++ [58,59]. The contribution from this process is very small in the analysis.",

Then, an iterative Bayesian procedure [60], using the particle-level predicted distribution as the initial prior and the migration matrix, is used to correct for bin migration. The iteration procedure reduces the dependence on the initial prior. The number of iterations is used as a regularisation parameter and controls the statistical uncertainty. Two iterations are found to be optimal for all distributions by MC studies aiming to minimise both the statistical uncertainty and the bias. Finally, the resulting estimate of the particle-level distribution is divided by the reconstruction efficiency bin by bin to obtain the final result. This approach represents a compromise between accounting for the small migration effects that occur and minimising the effect of small fluctuations in the detector-level distributions through the regularisation approach.",

It also indicates that, at least for this observable, an analogous reweighting of Sherpa events is not required due to this generator's intrinsic higher accuracy. The fixed-order NNLO QCD prediction by MATRIX shows an expected underestimation at and below the on-shell m ZZ threshold. This underestimation is mainly due to missing real, wide-angle QED emission effects in events where both Z bosons are on-shell, and amounts to several tens of percent of the total population in the region just below the on-shell threshold [36]. For the Sherpa 2.2.2 and Powheg + Pythia 8 samples, QED effects are included from estimates taken from QED shower programs. Moreover, the fixedorder MATRIX prediction is equivalent to having leading-order precision for the continuum gg \u2192 4 process and on-shell Higgs boson production, while the event generator samples include sizeable higher-order contributions. The predictions from Sherpa, Powheg-Box and MATRIX agree at the level of a few percent, outside the region of resonant Higgs boson production, if the comparison is performed prior to QED showering and without both the additional NLO electroweak corrections and the application of higher-order corrections to the gg \u2192 4 contribution. 200 300 500 900   ",

To explore and demonstrate this potential, a range of interpretations are presented in this paper. The production rate of gg \u2192 4 is extracted with respect to the SM prediction using the differential cross-section measured as a function of m 4 . The Z \u2192 4 branching fraction is estimated from the measured fiducial cross-section in the mass bin corresponding to m Z . Constraints on the rate of off-shell Higgs boson production (gg \u2192 H * \u2192 4 ) are derived using the double-differential cross-section measured as a function of m 4 and the D ME discriminant, which greatly enhances sensitivity to this type of process. Constraints on modified couplings of the Higgs boson to top quarks and gluons in the off-shell region are also derived, using the measured differential cross-section as a function of m 4 . All interpretations use a common statistical approach. A multivariate Gaussian likelihood function is used to quantify the level of agreement between a given prediction and observed data simultaneously across all bins of a measurement, taking into account correlations due to bin migration. The \u03c7 2 function defining the exponential component of the likelihood takes the form: Prediction / Observation Figure 10.

They are allowed to float within the associated theoretical uncertainties discussed in section 7. The observed 95% CL upper limit on the signal strength obtained in this way is 6.5. This agrees with the expected 95% CL upper limit of 5.4 within the range of [4.2, 7.2] for \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainty. This extraction demonstrates the degree to which an interpretation of measured cross-sections can approach the precision of dedicated measurements performed at detector level. The result can be compared to the upper limit of 4.5 obtained by the dedicated detector-level measurement [9] in the 4 final state using the same dataset and the same model. The sensitivity of this interpretation is slightly lower in comparison, due to the restrictions the unfolding procedure imposes on the binning of observables, the D ME discriminant in particular.",

Finally, the detector-corrected fourlepton mass distribution is used to constrain possible BSM modifications of the couplings of the Higgs boson to top quarks (c t ) and gluons (c g , zero in the SM) [71]. On-shell rates for Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion are only sensitive to |c t + c g | 2 , but measurements at higher mass (> 180 GeV) can be used to probe these parameters independently, as the partonic centre-of-mass energy of the process becomes larger than the top-quark mass. This provides an interesting test of the off-shell behaviour beyond dedicated measurements based on the rare ttH production mode [72]. Again, the yield from qq \u2192 4 is set to the Standard Model prediction and allowed to float within the associated theoretical uncertainties, while the yield from gg \u2192 4 is parameterised as a function of c t and c g using the procedure described in ref.

The signal strength of the gluon-gluon fusion production process is measured to be \u00b5 gg = 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 compared to an expected value of 1.0 \u00b1 0.4. A value for the Z \u2192 4 branching fraction of [4.70\u00b10.32(stat)\u00b10.25(syst)]\u00d710 \u22126 is obtained, consistent with existing measurements and exceeding the precision of previous ATLAS results. An upper limit on the signal strength for the off-shell Higgs production process of \u00b5 OS H < 6.5 is obtained at 95% CL. Finally, limits on anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to gluons and top quarks are derived.
