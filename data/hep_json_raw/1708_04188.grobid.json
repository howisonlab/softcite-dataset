The analyses are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within uncertainties. For the standard model HH hypothesis, the data exclude at 95% confidence level a product of the production cross section and branching fraction larger than 72 fb, corresponding to 79 times the standard model prediction. Constraints are placed on different scenarios considering anomalous couplings, which could affect the rate and kinematics of HH production. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of narrowwidth spin-0 and spin-2 particles decaying to Higgs boson pairs, the latter produced with minimal gravity-like coupling.",

At the CERN LHC, Higgs boson pairs are predominantly produced through gluon-gluon fusion via two destructively interfering diagrams, shown in figure 1. In the SM the destructive interference between these two diagrams makes the observation of HH production extremely challenging, even in the most optimistic scenarios of energy and integrated luminosity at the future High Luminosity LHC [10,11]. The SM cross section for HH production in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV is \u03c3 HH = 33.5 fb at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for the gluon-gluon fusion process [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21].",

The appearance of new contact-like interactions, not considered in this paper, could also result in an enhancement of HH production. Extensions of the scalar sector of the SM postulate the existence of additional Higgs bosons. An explored scenario is the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [25], where a second doublet of complex scalar fields is added to the SM scalar sector Lagrangian. The generic 2HDM potential has a large number of degrees of freedom, which can be reduced to six under specific assumptions. In case the new CP-even state is massive enough (mass larger than 2m H ) it can decay to a pair of Higgs bosons. Models inspired by warped extra dimensions [26] predict the existence of new heavy particles that can decay to pairs of Higgs bosons. Examples of such particles are the radion (spin 0) [27][28][29][30] or the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the graviton (spin 2) [31,32]. In the following, we will use X to denote a generic state decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons.",

The search is based on LHC proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The analysis focuses on the invariant mass distribution of the b jet pairs, searching for a resonant-like excess compatible with the Higgs boson mass, in combination with an artificial neural network discriminator based on kinematic information. The dominant background is tt production, with smaller contributions from Drell-Yan (DY) and single top quark production. and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionisation chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [40].",

The signal samples of gluon fusion production of two Higgs bosons, and of spin-0 or spin-2 narrow resonances decaying into two Higgs bosons, have been generated at leading order (LO) in QCD using MadGraph5 amc@nlo version 2.2.2.0. The spin-2 narrow resonance is produced as a KK-graviton with minimal coupling [49], leading to spin projection \u00b12 on the beam axis. The mass of the Higgs boson has been fixed to 125 GeV [50], and its branching fractions to those in the SM. One of the Higgs bosons is required to decay into a pair of b quarks, while the second one is required to decay to final states containing two leptons and two neutrinos of any flavour. This implies that the signal samples contain both H \u2192 Z( )Z(\u03bd\u03bd) and H \u2192 W( \u03bd)W( \u03bd) decay chains, leading to a total branching fraction B(HH \u2192 bbVV \u2192 bb \u03bd \u03bd) of 2.7% [12].

Additionally, electrons from photon conversions are rejected [62]. Muons are reconstructed from tracks found in the muon system, associated with tracks in the silicon tracking detectors. They are identified based on the quality of the track fit and the number of associated hits in the different tracking detectors [63]. The lepton isolation, defined as the scalar p T sum of all particle candidates in a cone around the lepton, excluding the lepton itself, divided by the lepton p T , is required to be <0.04 for electrons (with a cone of radius \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 = 0.3) and <0.15 for muons (with a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.4). Lepton identification and isolation efficiencies in the simulation are corrected for residual differences with respect to data. These corrections are measured in a data sample, enriched in Z \u2192 events, using a \"tag-and-probe\" method and are parameterised as a function of lepton p T and \u03b7.",

Left: expected (dashed) and observed (continuous) 95% CL upper limits on the product of the Higgs boson pair production cross section and branching fraction for HH \u2192 bbVV \u2192 bb \u03bd \u03bd as a function of \u03ba \u03bb /\u03ba t . The inner (green) band and the outer (yellow) band indicate the regions containing 68 and 95%, respectively, of the distribution of limits expected under the backgroundonly hypothesis. Red lines show the theoretical cross sections, along with their uncertainties, for \u03ba t = 1 (SM) and \u03ba t = 2. Right: exclusions in the (\u03ba \u03bb , \u03ba t ) plane. The red region corresponds to parameters excluded at 95% CL with the observed data, whereas the dashed black line and the blue areas correspond to the expected exclusions and the 68 and 95% bands (light and dark respectively). Isolines of the product of the theoretical cross section and branching fraction for HH \u2192 bbVV \u2192 bb \u03bd \u03bd are shown as dashed-dotted lines. The diamond marker indicates the prediction of the SM. All theoretical predictions are extracted from refs. [12][13][14][15][16][17]84].",

The LHC proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 are used. Masses are considered in the range between 260 and 900 GeV for the resonant search, while anomalous Higgs boson self-coupling and coupling to the top quark are considered in addition to the standard model case for the nonresonant search. The results obtained are in agreement, within uncertainties, with the predictions of the standard model. For the resonant search, the data exclude a product of the production cross section and branching fraction of narrow-width spin-0 particles from 430 to 17 fb, in agreement with the expectations of 340 +140 \u2212100 to 14 +6 \u22124 fb, and narrow-width spin-2 particles produced with minimal gravity-like coupling from 450 to 14 fb, in agreement with the expectations of 360 +140 \u2212100 to 13 +6 \u22124 fb. For the standard model HH hypothesis, the data exclude a product of the production cross section and branching fraction of 72 fb, corresponding to 79 times the SM cross section. The expected exclusion is 81 +42 \u221225 fb, corresponding to 89 +47 \u221228 times the SM cross section.",
