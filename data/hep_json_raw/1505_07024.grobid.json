The dominant uncertainty on these predictions reflects the uncertainties on the PDFs, which vary as functions of the kinematic variables studied. The forward acceptance of the LHCb detector allows the PDFs to be constrained at Bjorken-x values down to 10 \u22124 [6]. Ratios of the W and Z cross-sections provide precise tests of the SM as the sensitivity to the PDFs in the theoretical calculations is reduced and many of the experimental uncertainties cancel.",

This increases statistical precision and allows better control of systematic uncertainties, with the result that the total uncertainties on the measurements are significantly reduced. Measurements are performed for muons with transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV/c and pseudorapidity in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5. In the case of Z boson measurements, the invariant mass of the two muons is required to be in the range 60 < M \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 120 GeV/c 2 . These kinematic requirements define the fiducial region of the measurement and in this article are referred to as the fiducial requirements. Total cross-sections are presented as well as differential cross-sections as functions of the Z boson rapidity y Z , p T,Z and \u03c6 * Z . Here \u03c6 * Z is defined as [13] \u03c6 * Z \u2261 tan (\u03c6 acop /2) cosh (\u2206\u03b7/2) .",

Five background sources are investigated: decays of heavy flavour hadrons, hadron misidentification, Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays, tt and W + W \u2212 production. Unlike muons from signal, muons arising from decays of heavy flavour hadrons are neither directly produced at the primary interaction vertex, nor are they isolated particles. Using the techniques from ref. [7], the contribution from this background is estimated from the data to be 227 \u00b1 32 events, which amounts to 0.4% of the candidate sample. The contribution from hadrons that decay in flight or have sufficient energy to traverse the calorimeters and be detected in the muon stations is studied in randomly triggered data, as described in ref. [7], and determined to be 116 \u00b1 45 events, which is 0.2% of the candidate sample. Other electroweak and QCD backgrounds are estimated using Pythia simulation [25] and normalised to the measured total cross-sections for Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays [57,58], tt [59,60] and W + W \u2212 [61,62] production. The estimate for these sources is 66 \u00b1 6 events, or 0.1% of the candidate sample. In total, the background is estimated to be 409 \u00b1 56 events, or 0.7% of the candidate sample.",

The tag and probe tracks are required to satisfy the fiducial requirements. The tag must be identified as a muon and be consistent with triggering the event, while the probe is defined so that it is unbiased by the requirement for which the efficiency is being measured. The efficiency is studied as a function of several variables, which describe both the muon kinematics and the detector occupancy. In this analysis the efficiency as a function of muon \u03b7 is used. The efficiency in each bin of \u03b7 is defined as the fraction of tag-and-probe candidate events where the probe satisfies a track reconstruction, identification or trigger requirement. The tracking efficiency is determined using probe tracks that are reconstructed by combining hits from the muon stations and the large-area silicon-strip detector.

As the data sets are identical, the largest single source of uncertainty on the individual cross-sections, due to the luminosity determination, is removed. The trigger used to select both samples is identical and most of the uncertainty on the determination of the trigger efficiency cancels. In particular, the GEC is common to both the W and Z boson analyses and it is expected that the size of the efficiency correction is similar for W and Z events. Crosschecks in data and simulation support this assumption with a precision of approximately 0.3%, which is included as a systematic uncertainty. The GEC efficiency was determined for the previous W boson measurement [10] to be (95.9 \u00b1 1.1)%, whereas an improved precision of (94.0 \u00b1 0.2)% is obtained in the current analysis. Consequently, the W boson cross-section results are updated to benefit from the more precise value. These results are listed in tables 6, 7 and 8 of appendix A, along with the muon charge ratios and asymmetries, and supersede those in ref. [10]. The uncertainties on the tracking and muon identification partially cancel in the ratios of W and Z bosons. The uncertainty on the W + (W \u2212 ) cross-section due to beam energy is 1.06(0.91)% and most of this uncertainty also cancels in the ratios. The uncertainties on the purities of the W and Z boson selections are uncorrelated. The FSR uncertainties are taken to be uncorrelated.

            "text": "A measurement of the forward Z boson production cross-section at \u221a s = 7 TeV is presented, where the Z bosons are reconstructed in the decay Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The total cross-section in the fiducial range of the selection is in agreement with NNLO pQCD calculations. Normalised differential cross-sections as a function of y Z , \u03c6 * Z and p T,Z are compared to the predictions of various generators. The increased precision on the determination of the event trigger efficiency motivates a re-evaluation of the recently measured W boson production cross-section. These are presented here and supersede the values given in ref. [10]. Combining the Z boson cross-section with updated W boson cross-sections measured in a similar fiducial volume allows for precision measurements of electroweak boson cross-section ratios. In particular, the W to Z boson ratio is determined with a relative precision of 0.8%. The measured ratios are consistent with SM predictions but are sensitive to the particular choice of PDF. Consequently, these results are expected to provide significant constraints on PDFs.",
