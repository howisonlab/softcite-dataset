All the results are presented as a function of the centrality of the collision, estimated with a Glauber Monte Carlo fit to multiplicity distributions reconstructed in various detectors. The applicability of the Glauber model at LHC energies, the precision of the centrality determination and the related systematic uncertainties are discussed in detail. Particles are tracked in the pseudorapidity window |\u03b7| 0.9 with the silicon Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), over the range 0.15 < p T 50 GeV/c. The low-p T cut-off is further reduced in the multiplicity measurement using \"tracklets\", reconstructed in the 2 innermost layers of the ITS.",

Its evolution with centrality shows a pattern strikingly similar to the one measured at RHIC. Intermediate (5 p T 15 GeV/c) transverse momentum particles are found to be most strongly suppressed with respect to pp collisions, consistent with a large energy loss of hardscattered partons in the hot and dense medium.

            "text": "The ALICE experiment took data at the LHC in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. Measurements of charged particles are very important early studies which allow for a first characterization of the system produced in such collisions and provide basic constraints to theoretical models. In this paper we present results obtained in Pb-Pb collisions for charged primary particles, defined as all charged particles produced in the collision, including their decay products, but excluding products of weak decays of strange particles. The ALICE detector is mainly composed of a central barrel and of a forward muon spectrometer [1]. The main tracking elements in the central barrel are a large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and a six-layered silicon detector, the Inner Tracking System (ITS). They are embedded in a 0.5 T solenoidal field and cover the pseudorapidity window |\u03b7| 0.9. The material budget for a track going through the TPC is about 10% of a radiation length. The small material budget and moderate field lead to a low p T cut-off of about 150 MeV/c for full tracks reconstructed with the combined information of the ITS and TPC [2]. The p T resolution in the present analysis is about 10% up to p T = 50 GeV/c. The resolution on the transverse impact parameter relative to the primary vertex is about 200 \u00b5m at p T = 300 MeV/c and 35 \u00b5m at p T = 5 GeV/c. This allows for a good separation of primary and secondary particles, an important requirement for charged particle measurements at low p T . The multiplicity measurements employed track segments made of 2 hits in the 2 SPD layers pointing to a common vertex (\"tracklets\") as the default estimator [3,4]. As compared to full-fledged tracks, the tracklets have the advantage of a lower p T cutoff (\u223c 50 MeV/c) and of an extended \u03b7 coverage (|\u03b7| 2). For triggering purposes, two forward scintillator hodoscopes, the VZERO detectors, covering the pseudorapidity windows 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 were used. The present analyses use data collected with a minimum bias trigger requiring a combination of hits in the two innermost layers of the ITS (made of silicon pixel detectors, SPD) and in the VZERO.",

            "text": "The determination of the \"centrality\" of a collision, that is a measurement of the transverse overlap of the two nuclei, is one of the first important steps towards a full characterization of heavy-ion collisions. The data are divided in several centrality bins corresponding to well-defined percentiles of the total hadronic cross-section. The bins are defined using cuts on the multiplicity distributions measured in one of the sub-detectors. Our main estimate is based on the VZERO detector information [5]. Other estimators are used as cross-checks: clusters reconstructed in the SPD, tracks reconstructed in the TPC and energy deposited in the Zero Degree Calorimenters (ZDC, see below). In order to translate a cut in any of the above estimators into a given centrality percentile, the knowledge of the total hadronic cross-section is needed. This can be extracted from the data in two ways: i) fitting the experimental distribution with a Glauber model [6,7], ii) correcting the experimental distribution for the trigger efficiency and subtracting any background from non-hadronic interactions. The two approaches yield consistent results, with the former used as the default. The Glauber fit was done using a Monte Carlo calculation, which assumed Woods-Saxon nuclear density profiles (with parameters constrained by low energy electron-nucleus scattering measurements) and a nucleon-nucleon inelastic cross-section of \u03c3 inel NN = 64 \u00b1 5 mb, as interpolated from cosmic rays and pp data at different energies. This value is also consistent with the measured \u03c3 inel pp [8]. From the Glauber model calculation, one can extract the number of participants N part and the number of binary collisions N coll . It is then assumed that the number of particle production centers (\"ancestors\") is related to the number of participants and binary collisions as",

The R AA is also compared in Fig. 2 (left) to a similar measurement by the CMS experiment [15]. The results from the two experiments are consistent with each other [11]. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the centrality dependence of the R AA in different p T regions, as a function of N part . The data are also compared to previous measurements by the PHENIX experiment in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [13] for the region around the minimum (4 < p T < 7 GeV/c). The suppression increases with N part (and hence with centrality) at all p T . The strongest centrality dependence is observed for the region around the minimum [11]. As compared to the lower energy result we observe that the suppression is stronger at the LHC at all centralities (expressed in terms of N part ). If central RHIC results are compared to LHC results at a similar dN ch /d\u03b7 700, however, it is found that the suppression is comparable at the 2 energies.  The comparison with the theoretical calculations depicted in Fig. 2 (left) [16,17,18,19,20] shows that many models can reproduce the trend and level of suppression above p T 6 GeV/c. Due to the uncertainties in several of the input parameters to the model, different approaches are reproducing in a satisfactory way the R AA results. The uncertainty on the initial conditions will be better constrained with the upcoming p-A run at the LHC, with a measurement of the nuclear modification factor R pA and a measurement of the charged particle multiplicity over a large pseudorapidity range. Additional constraints [16] on the models come from the recently-released ALICE results on identified light flavour hadrons up to p T = 20 GeV/c [21].",
