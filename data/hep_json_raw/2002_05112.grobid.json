However, quantum chromodynamcs that lies in the origin of the quark model, being a nonperturbative theory, does not predict hadron properties, namely masses and decay widths, from first principles. Alternative theoretical approaches are developed, such as heavy quark effective theory or lattice calculations. These approaches require verification with experiment in various regimes, e.g. testing the agreement with data for hadrons with different quark content and quantum numbers. Baryons, containing a beauty quark form a particular family of hadrons, where the experimental data are still scarce.",

The measured masses and widths of these states are compatible with the expectations for the \u039b b (1D) 0 doublet [11][12][13][14]. Recently, the CMS collaboration reported an evidence for a broad excess of events in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum in the region of 6040 \u2212 6100 MeV corresponding to a statistical significance of four standard deviations [15]. 1 The existence of additional states in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 spectrum is predicted by the quark model [16][17][18], notably, in the region between the established narrow doublet states, with masses around 6.1 GeV. Quark-model predictions for the masses of the lightest \u039b b and \u03a3 ( * ) b states are shown in table 1. This paper reports the observation of a new structure in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, as well as updated measurements of the masses and widths of the \u039b b (5912) 0 and \u039b b (5920) 0 states with improved precision. The analysis uses pp collision data recorded by LHCb in 2011-2018 at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1, 2 and 6 fb \u22121 , respectively.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The momentum scale of the tracking system is calibrated using samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays collected concurrently with the data sample used for this analysis [25,26].

At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high transverse momentum, p T , or a pair of opposite-sign muons with a requirement on the product of muon transverse momenta, or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with at least one charged particle with a large p T and inconsistent with originating from any reconstructed primary pp collision vertex (PV) [30,31] or two muons of opposite charge forming a good-quality secondary vertex with a mass in excess of 2.7 GeV.",

            "text": "Further suppression of the background is achieved by using a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier [39,40] implemented in the TMVA toolkit [41]. Two separate BDTs are used for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 selections. The multivariate estimators are based on the kinematic properties, the reconstructed lifetime and vertex quality of the \u039b 0 b candidate and on variables describing the overall consistency of the selected candidates with the decay chain obtained from the kinematic fit described below [43]. In addition, the reconstructed lifetime and vertex quality of the \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + candidate is used for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 decay. The PID quality, transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the proton and kaon candidates (for \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 ) or \u03c0 \u2212 candidate (for \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 ) are also used. The BDT is trained using data, where the signal sample is obtained by subtracting the background using the sPlot technique [44], and the background sample is taken from the range 5.70 \u2212 5.85 GeV in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 mass distributions. A k-fold cross-validation technique is used to avoid introducing a bias in the evaluation [45]. A kinematic fit [43] is performed in order to improve the \u039b 0 b mass resolution. The momenta of the particles in the full decay chain are recomputed by constraining the \u039b + c or J/\u03c8 mass to their known values [4] and the \u039b 0 b baryon to originate from the associated PV. The mass distributions for the selected \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 candidates are shown in figure 1.

For the high-mass region, the p T of the dipion system is required to exceed 250 MeV. Simulated samples of excited \u039b 0 b baryons decaying into the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state are used as signal training samples, while the background training sample is taken from the same-sign \u039b 0 b \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 combinations in data.

If the observed broad peak corresponds to the \u03a3 b (1P) ( * )0 state, two peaks with similar masses and widths and significantly larger yields should be visible in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 \u00b1 mass spectra due to decays of the charged isospin partners \u03a3 b (1P) ( * )\u00b1 \u2192 \u039b 0 b \u03c0 \u00b1 .
