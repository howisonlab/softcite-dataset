            "text": "The Daya Bay experiment has observed correlations between reactor core fuel evolution and changes in the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum. Four antineutrino detectors in two experimental halls were used to identify 2.2 million inverse beta decays (IBDs) over 1230 days spanning multiple fuel cycles for each of six 2.9 GWth reactor cores at the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power plants. Using detector data spanning effective 239 Pu fission fractions F239 from 0.25 to 0.35, Daya Bay measures an average IBD yield, \u03c3 f , of (5.90 \u00b1 0.13) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission and a fuel-dependent variation in the IBD yield, d\u03c3 f /dF239, of (\u22121.86 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission. This observation rejects the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino flux as a function of the 239 Pu fission fraction at 10 standard deviations. The variation in IBD yield was found to be energy-dependent, rejecting the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino energy spectrum at 5.1 standard deviations. While measurements of the evolution in the IBD spectrum show general agreement with predictions from recent reactor models, the measured evolution in total IBD yield disagrees with recent predictions at 3.1\u03c3. This discrepancy indicates that an overall deficit in measured flux with respect to predictions does not result from equal fractional deficits from the primary fission isotopes 235 U, 239 Pu, 238 U, and 241 Pu. Based on measured IBD yield variations, yields of (6.17\u00b10.17) and (4.27\u00b10.26)\u00d710 \u221243 cm 2 /fission have been determined for the two dominant fission parent isotopes 235 U and 239 Pu. A 7.8% discrepancy between the observed and predicted 235 U yield suggests that this isotope may be the primary contributor to the reactor antineutrino anomaly.",

            "text": "Electron antineutrinos are produced in commercial nuclear reactor cores as neutron-rich fission fragments of the fission isotopes 235 U, 238 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu beta decay successively toward the isotopic line of stability. The total electron antineutrino flux produced by a reactor core is the sum of thousands of individual beta-decay branches, each producing its unique antineutrino flux and spectrum. Daya Bay has recently reported measurements of this aggregate antineutrino flux and spectrum [1,2]. These measurements confirm the observed discrepancy of \u223c6% between the measured reactor antineutrino fluxes of past experiments and reactor model predictions [3,4], also known as the \"reactor antineutrino anomaly\" [5], and indicate a disagreement between the measured and predicted antineutrino energy spectrum in the energy range of 5-7 MeV. Similar results have also been reported by other current reactor experiments [6,7]. Existing interpretations for these flux and spectrum discrepancies include deficiencies in fission beta spectrum conversion inputs and nuclear databases [8][9][10][11] or the existence of sterile neutrinos [12]. If correct, these explanations could have implications for future neutrino experiments [13,14] and nuclear applications [15].",

Since fission yields and beta-decay branches from each fission parent isotope are not identical, antineutrino fluxes and spectra produced from the various fission isotopes differ [16]. Thus, when a reactor experiences a change in the percent contribution to fission rates from each fissioning isotope (fission fractions), a measurable change in the reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum may also be produced. Previous experiments have demonstrated variations in the total reactor antineutrino flux with fuel evolution [17,18], while providing indications that a change in spectral shape with fuel evolution may be present [18]. In this Letter, we report the direct observation of a change in the reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum with reactor fuel evolution. This result is then used to determine the reactor antineutrino flux produced by 235 U and 239 Pu and to perform new tests of reactor antineutrino models.",

Only the data acquired with the four ADs in EH1 and EH2 in a period covering 1230 days from 2011 to 2015 were utilized in this analysis. This includes a period of 217 days with only three ADs present in the near halls, before the second AD was installed in EH2. EH1 is situated at a distance of about \u223c360 m from two cores, while EH2 is \u223c500 m away from the other four.

The definition in Eq. 3 allows expression of the measured IBD yield per nuclear fission \u03c3 f as a simple sum of IBD yields from the individual isotopes, \u03c3 f = i F i \u03c3 i . Weekly effective fission fraction values for each detector were produced using thermal power and fission fraction data for each core, which were provided by the power plant and validated by the collaboration using the APOLLO2 reactor modeling code [2]. The baselines and the mean survival probabilities used are the same as in Ref. [20], while e i values were taken from Ref. [21]. Throughout the Letter, changes in the IBD yield and spectrum per fission will be represented as a function of the effective fission fraction F 239 , which increases as nearby reactors' fuel cycles progress. At the beginning of each core's fuel cycle, when 1/3 (1/4) of fuel rods in Daya Bay (Ling Ao) cores are fresh, 239 Pu fission fractions f 239 are \u223c15%. This fraction then rises to \u223c40% by the end of the cycle. Effective 239 Pu fission fractions F 239 are shown for the EH1 and EH2 ADs in Fig. 1. The F 239 values for ADs at the same EH are identical to <0.1%. Periods of constant positive slope correspond to continuous running and evolution of fuel in the cores, while sharp drops in F 239 correspond to the shut-down and start-up of a reactor. For EH1 (EH2), \u223c80% of the antineutrinos originate from the two Daya Bay (four Ling Ao) cores. As ADs receive fluxes from multiple cores with differing fuel compositions, variations in the effective fission fractions at an AD are smaller than variations in the fission fractions within a single core. The relationships between F 239 and the effective fission fractions of the other fissioning isotopes for the same dataset are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. The average effective fission fractionsF i for i = (235, 238, 239, 241) for the combined EH1 and EH2 ADs were (0.571,0.076,0.299,0.054).",

Dominant uncertainties in this calculation arise from limitations in the accuracy of water flow rate measurements. Since these measurement techniques are independent of core composition, this uncertainty was treated for a single core as fully correlated at all fission fraction values. Fission fraction uncertainties of \u03b4f i /f i =5% were determined by comparing measurements of isotopic content in spent nuclear fuel to values obtained by the APOLLO2 reactor modeling code [2,22].

The statistical errors in \u03c3 f values are the leading uncertainty in the measurement, with reactor data systematics also providing a non-negligible contribution; errors arising from assuming linear trends in IBD yield with F 239 (Eq. 4) are negligible. The fit also provides a total IBD yield\u03c3 f of (5.90 \u00b1 0.13) \u00d710 \u221243 cm 2 /fission with the error dominated by uncertainty in the estimation of the ADs' IBD detection efficiency. This result was then compared to a constant reactor antineutrino flux model, where d\u03c3 f /dF 239 = 0. This model, depicted by the horizontal green line in Fig. 2, provides a best fit with \u03c7 2 /NDF = 115/7. The best-fit d\u03c3 f /dF 239 value is incompatible with this constant flux model at 10 standard deviations (\u03c3). Observed IBD yields were compared to those predicted by recent reactor antineutrino models, generated according to Eqs. 1 and 2. Among many available models [9,[25][26][27], 235 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu antineutrino spectrum per fission predictions from Huber [3] and 238 U predictions from Mueller et. al [4] were used to enable a direct comparison to the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The predicted total IBD yield\u03c3 f , (6.22 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d710 \u221243 cm 2 /fission, differs from the measured \u03c3 f by 1.7\u03c3. This 5.1% deficit is consistent with previous measurements reported by Daya Bay [1,2], as well as with the \u223c6% deficit observed in global fits of past reactor experiments. The predicted d\u03c3 f /dF 239 from the Huber-Mueller model, (\u22122.46 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission, is represented in Fig. 2 after scaling by the 5.1% difference in predicted and measured\u03c3 f from this analysis. This predicted d\u03c3 f /dF 239 differs from the measurement by 3.1\u03c3, indicating additional tension between flux measurements and models beyond the established differences in total IBD yield\u03c3 f . In particular, it suggests that the fractional difference between predicted and measured antineutrino fluxes may not be the same for all fission isotopes. If measured fractional yield deficits from all isotopes are equal, the ratio of the slope d\u03c3 f /dF 239 to the total yield\u03c3 f will be identical for measurement and prediction. These ratios, -0.31 \u00b1 0.03 and -0.39 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, are incompatible at 2.6\u03c3 confidence level.",

If the anomaly is produced solely via incorrect predictions of 235 U, the measured \u03c3 235 should deviate from its predicted value while \u03c3 238,239,241 remain at their predicted values; enforcement of this additional constraint in Eq. 7 produced a best fit higher by \u2206\u03c7 2 /NDF= 0.17/1 (twosided p-value 0.68). A similar test of 239 Pu as the sole source of the anomaly yielded a best-fit value higher by \u2206\u03c7 2 /NDF = 10.0/1 (p-value 0.00016). Requiring all isotopes in Eq. 7 to exhibit an equal fractional deficit with respect to prediction, the best-fit was found to be higher by \u2206\u03c7 2 /NDF= 7.9/1 (p-value 0.0049).

While the measured evolution of the IBD energy spectrum is generally consistent with this model, measured\u03c3 f and d\u03c3 f /dF 239 values are incompatible with predictions at 1.7\u03c3 and 3.1\u03c3 confidence levels. These discrepancies indicate issues in modeling the reactor antineutrino flux. One can invoke a model including only eV-scale sterile neutrino oscillations to explain the observed deficit in \u03c3 f . Such a model requires an equal fractional flux deficit from all fission isotopes and a ratio of d\u03c3 f /dF 239 to\u03c3 f unchanged from the prediction, which is incompatible with Daya Bay's observation at 2.6\u03c3. Comparison of measured and predicted 235 U and 239 Pu IBD yields instead indicates preference for incorrect prediction of the 235 U flux as the primary source of the reactor antineutrino anomaly. Improvement in Daya Bay's measurements of \u03c3 235 and \u03c3 239 can be achieved with increased statistics and with reduction of AD-correlated IBD detection efficiency systematic uncertainty. Future short-baseline experiments at highly-enriched uranium reactors [34][35][36] may also provide the capability to probe this apparent over-prediction via precise new measurements of the 235 U antineutrino flux.",
