The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. For T quarks with large mass values the top quarks and Higgs bosons can have significant Lorentz boosts, so that their individual decay products often overlap and merge. Methods are applied to resolve the substructure of such merged jets. Upper limits on the production cross section of a T quark with mass between 500 and 1000 GeV/c 2 are derived. If the T quark decays exclusively to tH, the observed (expected) lower limit on the mass of the T quark is 745 (773) GeV/c 2 at 95% confidence level. For the first time an algorithm is used for tagging boosted Higgs bosons that is based on a combination of jet substructure information and b tagging.",

The mechanism that stabilizes the mass of the Higgs particle is not entirely clear and could be explained by little Higgs models [3,4], models with extra dimensions [5,6], and composite Higgs models [5][6][7]. These theories predict the existence of heavy vector-like quarks that may decay into top quarks and Higgs bosons. This article presents a search for exotic resonances decaying into Higgs bosons and top quarks. A model of vector-like T quarks with charge 2/3 e, which are produced in pairs by the strong interaction, is used as a benchmark for this analysis.",

This allows direct mass terms in the Lagrangian of the form m\u03c8\u03c8 that do not violate gauge invariance. As a consequence, vector-like quarks do not acquire their mass via Yukawa couplings, in contrast to the other quark families. A fourth generation of chiral fermions, replicating one of the three generations of the SM with identical quantum numbers, is disfavoured by electroweak fits within the framework of the SM [8]. This is because of the large modifications to the Higgs production cross sections and branching fractions, if a single SM-like Higgs doublet is assumed. Vector-like heavy quarks are not similarly constrained by the measurements of the Higgs boson properties [9].",

            "text": "While searches for T quarks have been performed in leptonic final states [10][11][12][13][14], this article presents the first analysis that exploits the all-hadronic final state in the search for vector-like quarks. In the SM the Higgs boson decays predominantly into b quark pairs with a branching fraction of 58% for a mass of 125 GeV/c 2 , while the top quark decays almost exclusively into a bottom quark and a W boson, which in turn decays hadronically 67.6% of the time. The main final state is therefore the all-hadronic final state T \u2192 tH \u2192 (bjj)(bb), where j denotes the light-flavour jets of the W boson decay and b denotes the b-flavour jets from the top quark or Higgs boson decays. For sufficiently large T quark mass values, the decay products can be highly Lorentz-boosted, leading to final states with overlapping and merged jets. In the extreme case, all top quark decay products are merged into a single jet. A similar topology may arise for the Higgs boson decaying into b quarks. A related analysis concept has been proposed in ref. [15]. In recent years, the methodology of jet substructure analysis has proved to be very powerful in resolving such boosted topologies [16][17][18][19]. For example, the analysis of high-mass Z' resonances decaying into top quark pairs became feasible in the all-hadronic final state as a result of the application of jet substructure methods [20][21][22]. A similar strategy is followed in this analysis by applying algorithms for the identification of boosted top quarks (t tagging) and boosted Higgs bosons (H tagging) in combination with algorithms for the identification of b quark jets (b tagging). In particular, the application of b tagging in subjets has enhanced the identification of boosted bb final states, for instance H \u2192 bb decays. This is the first analysis to apply an algorithm for tagging boosted Higgs bosons that is based on a combination of jet substructure information and b tagging.",

Daughter particles of these top quarks are therefore not well separated. In many cases all of the top quark decay products are clustered into a single, large jet by the event reconstruction algorithms. The approximate spread of a hadronic top quark decay can be determined on simulated events from the \u2206R distances between the quarks produced during its decay. The four-momenta of the two quarks with the smallest \u2206R distance, \u2206R(q 1 , q 2 ), are vectorially summed and the \u2206R distance between the vector sum and the third quark, \u2206R(q 1+2 , q 3 ), is evaluated. The maximum distance between \u2206R(q 1 , q 2 ) and \u2206R(q 1+2 , q 3 ) indicates the approximate size \u2206R bij needed to cluster the entire top quark decay within one single CA jet. For the boosted decays of a Higgs boson in H \u2192 bb events, the corresponding quantity can be defined as the angular distance \u2206R bb = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 between the two generated b quarks. Figure 1 shows the distributions of these quantities plotted as a function of the transverse momentum of the top quark and of the Higgs boson, generated from the decay of a T quark with a mass of 1000 GeV/c 2 .

Selections are applied in the two-dimensional plane defined by the ratio m 23 /m 123 and the arctangent of m 13 /m 12 . Here m 23 is the pairwise mass of the second and third leading subjets. The variables m 12 , m 13 , and m 123 are defined in a similar fashion. The distribution of events in this plane is shown for simulated tt events in figure 6 (left) and for a mixture of background (boson+jets, di-boson, single top quark, tt all-hadronic, and tt leptonic) events in figure 6 (right). A region with a well enhanced structure is only present for tt events. The region is highlighted by the thick black lines in figure 6. This structure can be used to suppress backgrounds that do not contain boosted top quarks by rejecting events that lie outside of this region. Additionally, a selection on the top candidate mass, 140 < m 123 < 250 GeV/c 2 , is applied. Another populated region shows up below and to the left of the selected region because of unmerged top decays. This contribution disappears for boosted top quarks above p T > 300 GeV/c.",

A binned likelihood method is used where the values for the P variables are taken from histograms. The distribution of this variable is shown in figure 12 for data compared to the background prediction and signal hypotheses, for both the single and multiple H tag categories. As the signal model is included in the discriminator, each signal mass hypothesis has its own definition of L. The mass points 500, 700, and 1000 GeV/c 2 are shown in these figures. The spikes in these distributions are due to the likelihood definition, that is obtained by taking values from binned distributions. No signal-like excess is observed in data. Bayesian upper limits [52] on the T quark production cross section are obtained with the Theta framework [53].

Results are presented for exclusive T quark decay modes as well as for non-exclusive branching fractions. If the heavy T quark has a branching fraction of 100% for T \u2192 tH, the observed (expected) exclusion limit on the mass of the T quark is 745 (773) GeV/c 2 at 95% confidence level.
