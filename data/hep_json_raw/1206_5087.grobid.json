We observe a clear signal of the \u03b7c(1S) and measure its mass and width to be M (\u03b7c(1S)) = (2982.7 \u00b1 1.8(stat) \u00b1 2.2(syst) \u00b1 0.3(model)) MeV/c 2 and \u0393(\u03b7c(1S)) = (37.8 +5.8   \u22125.3 (stat) \u00b1 2.8(syst) \u00b1 1.4(model)) MeV/c 2 . The third error is an uncertainty due to possible interference between the \u03b7c(1S) and a non-resonant component. We also report the first evidence for \u03b7(1760) decay to \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; we find two solutions for its parameters, depending on the inclusion or not of the X(1835), whose existence is of marginal significance in our data. From a fit to the mass spectrum using coherent X(1835) and \u03b7(1760) resonant amplitudes, we set a 90% confidence level upper limit on the product \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) for the X(1835).",

However, even its main parameters, such as the mass, width and two-photon width, have not been well measured and the measurements that have been reported show a large scatter of values [1]. Discrepancies among measurements for the \u03b7 c (1S) product of the two-photon width and decay branching fraction into four-meson final states were confirmed earlier [2]. A recent measurement of the \u03b7 c (1S) that found a significant interference between the \u03b7 c (1S) and the non-resonant background [3] may have clarified the reason for discrepancies among \u03b7 c (1S) parameter measurements [4]. Significant model-dependent uncertainty in the measurement of the \u03b7 c (1S) product branching fractions due to interference between the \u03b7 c (1S) and a non-resonant component has also been studied in B \u2192 K\u03b7 c (1S) decays [5].",

            "text": "The X(1835) resonance was observed and confirmed recently by the BES collaboration in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X(1835) decays where X(1835) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [6], with mass M = (1836.5 \u00b1 3.0 +5. 6 \u22122.1 ) MeV/c 2 and width \u0393 = (190 \u00b1 9 +38 \u221236 ) MeV/c 2 . A variety of speculations on the nature of the X(1835) have been reported, including baryonium [7] with sizable gluon content [8], glueball [9][10][11], and a radial excitation of the \u03b7 \u2032 [12,13]. The BES experiment has suggested that the X(1835) may be related to the pp threshold enhancement seen in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp decays [14,15]. An additional structure, the \u03b7(1760), was observed in the radiative J/\u03c8 decays to \u03b3\u03c1\u03c1 and \u03b3\u03c9\u03c9 by MARKIII [16] and DM2 [17] and to \u03b3\u03c9\u03c9 and \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by BES [18]. The \u03b7(1760) state has been proposed as a mixture of a gluonic meson with a conventional qq state [19], rather than a pure qq meson, and this hypothesis is supported by a BES analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9\u03c9 decays [18]. Hence, an investigation of the nature of both the X(1835) and \u03b7(1760) is of interest [20]. In radiative J/\u03c8 decays, hadrons are produced via two gluons; thus, the production of final states with a gluon-enriched component is expected to be enhanced. In light of the similar structure of the two-photon and two-gluon couplings, a comparison of the \u03b3\u03b3 width of a meson to its production rate in radiative J/\u03c8 decays can provide information on its quark and gluon composition. The two-photon coupling to the gluonic component is expected to be very weak so measurements of two-photon widths can help clarify the nature of the X(1835) and \u03b7(1760).",

The upper limit for the signal yield at 90% confidence level is determined by integrating the likelihood distribution convolved with a Gaussian function to include the systematic error. Another fit without interference between the resonances is performed to examine the significance of the X(1835) signal. The statistical significance from the fit with two incoherent resonances is found to be 3.2\u03c3 for the X(1835) and 4.4\u03c3 for the \u03b7(1760).

Indeed, a large f 2 (1270) signal is observed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events selected in that region, as shown in Fig. 6. The dominant \u03b7 \u2032 f 2 (1270) component in the upper sideband region shows interesting dynamics with a broad structure with favored quantum numbers J P = 2 + . A nearly isotropic distribution in the mass region below 2.04 GeV/c 2 after the efficiency correction (with \u03c7 2 /N dof = 9.9/9) is compatible with the assumption of pseudoscalar quantum numbers for the \u03b7(1760) and X(1835). However, a possible non-flat distribution for the N R will influence the distribution for the R component; thus, a plausible J P value for each R should be examined with the N R component subtracted once the existence of the \u03b7(1760) and X(1835) production is clarified. No significant intermediate state is seen in the mass region below 2.04 GeV/c 2 . However, a minor contribution from another J P = 2 \u2212 resonance [30] cannot be ruled out. ",

A precise description of the data in this case is impossible without a good understanding of the background. As discussed in section V-C, the N R component in the mass region above 2.2 GeV/c 2 has a contamination of events from non-0 \u2212 production via two-photon processes. Although contamination is evident even in the \u03b7 c (1S) mass region, our data sample is insufficient to determine the type and rate of production of the non-0 \u2212 states in this mass region. The N R component in our analysis can be subdivided into two types: one for the nonresonant final state (denoted as N R1) that interferes with R and the other for production of various non-0 \u2212 states (denoted N R2) that do not interfere with the R.

The insensitivity of the maximum likelihood value for the fits in the full \u03b1 N R region between zero and 100% and a strong correlation between \u03b1 N R and \u03c6 imply large uncertainties in the determination of \u03b1 N R , \u03c6 and the strength of the interference term. With an additional error source from the interference term, the \u03b7 c (1S) yield has also a large uncertainty ranging from 264 \u00b1 22 to 486 \u00b1 40 for constructive interference and from 486 \u00b1 40 to 854 \u00b1 59 for destructive interference depending on the true \u03b1 N R and \u03c6 values. Our fit results, as well as the absence of any visual asymmetry in the \u03b7 c (1S) line shape in the data, indicate that the interference term cannot be determined without independent information on the N R1 component such as its angular distribution in the \u03b7 c (1S) sideband mass region. The measured mass and width of the \u03b7 c (1S) have a marginal dependence on the interference, while the yield is strongly correlated with the interference component and, thus, cannot be determined precisely with the existing data sample. The situation would improve if the interference effect were determined independently with a much larger data sample.",

The D 0 mass resulting from a fit of the invariant mass spectrum of \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 S is lower than its nominal value by 1.4 MeV/c 2 , which is taken as an uncertainty of the mass scale after a linear correction for mass value. The uncertainty in the width determination can arise from a difference in the mass resolution between data and MC simulation. This is estimated by changing the mass resolution by \u00b11 MeV/c 2 and is found to be 2.0 MeV/c 2 for the \u03b7 c (1S) and 10 MeV/c 2 for the \u03b7(1760). Systematic errors on the mass, width and \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 B product due to uncertainties in the N R background estimation are determined by varying the fit mass interval and | p * t | requirement separately. The error contributions from uncertainties in determination of the b 1 and b 2 backgrounds are minor for the \u03b7 c (1S) but are sizable in the mass region below 2 GeV/c 2 . The uncertainties in the resonance parameters, estimated by varying the shape parameters and yields of the b 1 and b 2 backgrounds by \u00b11\u03c3 and added in quadrature, are taken as the corresponding errors for the X(1835) and \u03b7(1760), respectively.",

The trigger efficiency for four-track events is relatively high because of redundant two-track and multi-track triggers in the Belle first-level trigger. From the trigger simulation program, the difference in the efficiency with and without both trigger conditions satisfied is found to be 1% (2.7%) at an invariant mass of 2.98 (1.84) GeV/c 2 ; this is included as a systematic error. The efficiency for the pion identification, determined by using the inclusive D * sample, is lower than that from MC simulation by (1.40 \u00b1 0.64)% for the \u03b7 c (1S) and (0.02 \u00b1 0.60)% for the \u03b7(1760), and the corresponding contributions to the systematic error are 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively. The reconstruction efficiency for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is studied with an inclusive \u03b7 sample, and its deviation from the MC simulation plus its error in quadrature is 4.9%. The uncertainty in the track reconstruction efficiency is 5.5% and that of the \u03c0 0 -veto requirement is 3%. The accuracy of the twophoton luminosity function calculated by the TREPS generator is estimated to be about 5% including the error from neglecting radiative corrections (2%), the uncertainty from the form factor effect (2%), and the error of the total integrated luminosity (1.4%) [23]. The background contribution from the initial-state radiation processes is negligible [2]. Furthermore, the run-dependent background conditions add an additional uncertainty of 3% in the yield determination. A dominant source of systematic errors for the X(1835) yield is the uncertainty of its decay width. It is estimated to be 18% by changing the width by \u00b11\u03c3 \u0393 in the fit for the yield extraction.",

If we assume that there is no interference, the directly measured product for the \u03b7 c (1S) decay width to \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is determined to be \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 B(\u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (50.5 +4.2 \u22124.1 \u00b1 5.6) eV/c 2 , which is marginally consistent with the existing value (194 \u00b1 97) eV/c 2 from the indirect measurements [1]. Instead of a direct reference to the worldaverage value for \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03b7 c (1S)), we determine it from the ratio of \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 \u0393(KK\u03c0)/\u0393 total = (0.407 \u00b1 0.027) keV/c 2 to TABLE I: Summary of systematic uncertainty contributions to the mass and width for the \u03b7c(1S) and \u03b7(1760) and to \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 B for the \u03b7c(1S), \u03b7(1760) and X(1835). 1-R and 2-R denote one and two resonances in the fit, respectively.  \u0393(KK\u03c0)/\u0393 total = (7.0 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10 \u22122 [1], and obtain the width \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03b7 c (1S)) = (5.8 \u00b1 1.1) keV/c 2 with a smaller relative error. With that as an input, the branching fraction is calculated to be B(\u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (0.87 \u00b1 0.20)%, where both statistical and systematic errors are included. We report the first evidence for \u03b7(1760) decay to \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and find two solutions for its parameters, depending on the inclusion or not of the X(1835), whose existence is marginal in our fits. The decay \u03b7(1760) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is found with a significance of 4.7\u03c3 including systematic error, with the assumption that the X(1835) is not produced; the \u03b7(1760) mass and width are determined to be M = (1768 +24 \u221225 \u00b1 10) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (224 +62 \u221256 \u00b1 25) MeV/c 2 . The fitted \u03b7(1760) mass is consistent with the existing measurements [17,18]. The product of the two-photon decay width and the branching fraction for the \u03b7(1760) decay to \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is determined to be \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 B(\u03b7(1760) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (28.2 +7.9 \u22127.5 \u00b1 3.7) eV/c 2 . When the mass spectrum is fitted with two coherent resonances, the \u03b7(1760) and X(1835), the \u03b7(1760) mass and width are found to be M = (1703 +12 \u221211 \u00b1 1.8) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (42 +36 \u221222 \u00b1 15) MeV /c 2 , and the signal significances including the systematic error estimated to be 4.1\u03c3 for the \u03b7(1760) and 2.8\u03c3 for the X(1835).

The function f , including the f int term, is convolved with a mass resolution function after corrections for dL \u03b3\u03b3 /dW and efficiency. The f s and f N R PDFs are normalized; the function f int is fully determined by the fit parameters.To investigate the possible effect of interference with the N R component, a fit to the \u03b7 c (1S) signal with interference with N R1 but without interference with N R2 is performed for various initial input values for the \u03b1 N R and \u03c6 parameters.For the \u03b7 c (1S), the fit gives two solutions with almost the same maximum likelihood value; the mass and width of the \u03b7 c (1S) are M = 2982.7 (2983.0) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 36.4 MeV/c 2 at \u03b1 N R = 0.01% (100%); these are quite consistent with the result of the fit without interference. The differences in the \u03b7 c (1S) mass and width with and without interference, \u2206M = 0.3 MeV/c 2 and \u2206\u0393 = 1.4 MeV/c 2 , are taken as model-dependent uncertainties in the determination of the mass and width. However, the fits give very different values for the \u03b7 c (1S) yield. If, for example, \u03b1 N R is fixed at 100% in the fit with interference, the yields obtained are Y 1 = 854 \u00b1 59 with \u03c6 1 = (\u221292 \u00b1 5) \u2022 for destructive interference and Y 2 = 264 \u00b1 22 with \u03c6 2 = (91 \u00b1 8) \u2022 for constructive interference, while the \u03b7 c (1S) yield of the incoherent fit is 486 +40 \u221239 . A strong correlation between \u03b1 N R and \u03c6 is observed from the fits: \u03c6 1 and \u03c6 2 are close to 180 \u2022 and \u2212180 \u2022 (90 \u2022 and \u221290 \u2022 )",
