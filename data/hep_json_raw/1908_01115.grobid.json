The data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Final states with one or two charged leptons are considered. The invariant mass of the reconstructed top quark pair system and variables that are sensitive to the spin of the particles decaying into the top quark pair are used to search for signatures of the H or A bosons. The interference with the standard model top quark pair background is taken into account. A moderate signal-like deviation compatible with an A boson with a mass of 400 GeV is observed with a global significance of 1.9 standard deviations. New stringent constraints are reported on the strength of the coupling of the hypothetical bosons to the top quark, with the mass of the bosons ranging from 400 to 750 GeV and their total relative width from 0.5 to 25%. The results of the search are also interpreted in a minimal supersymmetric standard model scenario. Values of m A from 400 to 700 GeV are probed, and a region with values of tan \u03b2 below 1.0 to 1.5, depending on m A , is excluded at 95% confidence level.",

Multiple extensions of the SM predict new spin-0 states. These include two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) [4], of which the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [5,6] is a particular realization, models predicting a new electroweak singlet [7], and other models with a combination of singlet and doublet fields [8]. The additional bosons may also provide a portal to dark matter, by acting as a mediator between SM and dark matter particles [9,10].",

Provided that additional Higgs bosons couple to fermions via a Yukawa interaction, the top quark's high mass suggests the size of the coupling to these new bosons to be large as well. Hence, assuming the masses of the JHEP04(2020)171 new \u03a6 bosons are sufficiently high, their possible decay to a top quark pair is particularly interesting. Decays of CP-odd Higgs bosons to weak vector bosons, A \u2192 WW and A \u2192 ZZ, are forbidden (at tree level) if the CP symmetry is assumed. Such decays are also strongly suppressed for H bosons in the vicinity of the alignment limit of 2HDMs, in which the properties of the h boson approach those of the SM Higgs boson [11]. The aligned scenario may naturally occur as a result of a broken symmetry, and such models imply the existence of additional Higgs bosons at relatively low mass ( 550 GeV) [12]. In this paper, however, we do not rely on the assumption of alignment and its naturalness, and probe masses between 400 and 750 GeV.",

When the heavy Higgs boson decays into a top quark pair, this mode interferes at the quantum level with the SM production of top quark pairs. Example Feynman diagrams are shown in figure 1. As a consequence, the signal consists of a resonant and an interference component. The resonant component corresponds to the square of the amplitude given by the signal diagram, and results in a Breit-Wigner peak in the distribution of the invariant mass of the tt system, m tt . The interference component may be either destructive or constructive, depending on the phase space region and signal model. The sum of the components may result in a peak-dip structure in the m tt distribution [14][15][16]. It is worth noting that the shape and magnitude of the interference depends on the specific signal model, and can be significantly modified by new particles appearing in the loop of the production diagram [17,18].",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [25].",

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings, referred to as pileup, can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet momentum corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon + jet, Z + jet, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events (consisting uniquely of jets produced through the strong interaction), are used to account for any residual differences in jet p T scale in data and simulation [29]. The relative jet p T resolution amounts typically to 15-20% at 30 GeV, 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [30].",

The generator employs the NNPDF3.0 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [39], and is interfaced with pythia 8.212 [40] for fragmentation and hadronization, with the CUETP8M1 underlying event tune [41,42]. Signal event samples are produced for (pseudo)scalar boson masses of 400, 500, 600, and 750 GeV, with relative total decay widths \u0393 \u03a6 /m \u03a6 of 2.5, 5, 10, and 25% for each mass scenario. The factorization and renormalization scales, \u00b5 F and \u00b5 R , are set on an event-by-event basis to m tt /2, following the choice in ref. [43]. The top quarks from the heavy Higgs boson decay are decayed in MadGraph5 amc@nlo, preserving their spin correlations. Samples are generated for JHEP04(2020)171 events corresponding to the resonant heavy boson signal, and for events corresponding to interference terms in the matrix element calculation between the signal and SM tt background. Events in the interference samples can receive negative weights, which reflects the sign of the corresponding part of the squared matrix element in the presence of a destructive interference. Since the heavy Higgs boson is produced via gluon fusion with a top quark loop, the coupling between the boson and the top quark appears twice in the matrix element. As a result, events originating from the resonance (interference) matrix element terms correspond to a cross section that is proportional to g 4 \u03a6tt (g 2 \u03a6tt ).",

The ratio of the NNLO cross section over the LO cross section computed with MadGraph5 amc@nlo determines the K factor, typically of size \u22482, applied to the resonant part of the signal. The K factors applied to the interference component of the signal are obtained as the geometric mean of the K factors of the resonant signal and the SM tt process [43]. The SM tt K factor is 1.6, calculated as the ratio between the NNLO cross section used for the simulated tt sample, as described below, and the LO cross section obtained in a similar setup. The K factors for the resonant part of the signal and the interference are applied throughout this analysis. In the hMSSM interpretation, we also use the 2hdmc program [45] to calculate, for given m A and tan \u03b2, the mass of the H boson and the widths of both heavy Higgs bosons, as well as other MSSM parameters.",

The Z/\u03b3 * + jets, W + jets, and ttV event samples are generated using MadGraph5 amc@nlo. For the single boson production processes, events with up to four additional partons are generated at LO, and the MLM matching scheme [61] is employed to combine the different parton multiplicities. The single-boson production cross sections are calculated at NNLO [62,63]. In the dilepton analysis, the normalization of the Z/\u03b3 * + jets contribution is determined from a control region in data. The ttV events are generated at NLO, applying mc@nlo [64] merging, and are normalized using NLO cross section predictions. Events simulating the diboson processes are generated using pythia and normalized to the respective NNLO (for WW production) [65] or NLO (for WZ and ZZ production) [66] cross sections. The modeling of QCD multijet events is obtained from a control region in data, but events simulated with pythia are used to validate the modeling. All events are interfaced with pythia for the fragmentation and hadronization, using the CUETP8M2T4 (single top processes) or CUETP8M1 (others) tunes.",

A correct jet-quark assignment exists for 44% of such events that pass the event selection. For those events where a correct assignment exists and a solution can be found for the neutrino momentum, the probability that all four jets are correctly assigned to the quarks varies from around 60 to 80%, depending on the value of the invariant mass of the generator-level top quark pair, m gen tt . The relative m tt resolution, as computed with all selected events with targeted decays, changes from about 17 to 21%, depending on m gen tt . The tt reconstruction results in a solution in about 85% of observed events, and only the events with a solution are considered for further analysis. The search for the \u03a6 \u2192 tt signal is performed using two observables. The first one is the invariant mass m tt , as obtained from the tt reconstruction algorithm, and probes the mass of the heavy (pseudo)scalar boson. The second observable is |cos \u03b8 * t |, where \u03b8 * t denotes the angle between the momentum of the semileptonically decaying top quark in the tt rest frame and the momentum of the tt system in the laboratory frame, as illustrated in figure 2. In a \u03a6 \u2192 tt signal process, the heavy Higgs boson would decay into top quarks isotropically, resulting in a flat distribution of cos \u03b8 * t at the generator level. The SM tt production, on the other hand, yields a distribution peaking at \u00b11. As a result, the distribution of |cos \u03b8 * t | is relatively enriched in signal events towards |cos \u03b8 * t | = 0. The QCD multijet background is estimated from dedicated control regions in the data, independently in the electron and muon channels. The total event yield for this background -8 - is obtained from data using a variant of the ABCD method [69]. Four regions are defined, based on the relative isolation of the lepton (smaller or greater than the isolation threshold imposed on the tight lepton), and the m W T variable (smaller or greater than 50 GeV). The three regions complementary to the signal region are relatively enriched in the multijet background. The overall rate of QCD multijet background in the signal region is estimated with a simultaneous fit to the numbers of events observed in the four regions, exploiting the factorization of the distribution of this background in (m W T , I rel ). The shape of the multijet distribution of the observables m tt and |cos \u03b8 * t | is determined from data using events with an inverted lepton isolation selection applied, after subtracting the contributions from other backgrounds.",

The effect on the acceptance is considered, but the effect on the cross section is ignored as it is already included in the considered uncertainty in the cross section. The renormalization scales used in the parton shower simulation of initial-state radiation (ISR) and final-state radiation (FSR) are also varied independently by a factor of 2 in each direction. The effect of the uncertainty in the amount of ISR, as well as in the underlying event tune used in the simulation, was found not to be statistically significant. The uncertainty in the top quark mass is considered by shifting m t in the simulation by \u00b13 GeV and rescaling the induced variations by a factor of 1/6 to emulate a more realistic top quark mass uncertainty of 0.5 GeV [74]. The uncertainty in the matching scale between the matrix element and the parton shower is evaluated by varying the powheg parameter, h damp , that controls the suppression of radiation of additional high-p T jets [50]. The nominal value of h damp in the simulation is 1.58 m t , and the varied values are 0.99 m t and 2.24 m t . The uncertainty arising from the choice of the PDF set is evaluated by reweighting the simulated tt events using 100 replicas of the NNPDF3.0 set. A principal component analysis is performed on the variations from the PDF replicas to construct two base variations, such that the deviation from the nominal distribution given by each replica can be described as a linear combination of the base variations. The uncertainty in the \u03b1 S parameter used in the PDF set induces a third independent PDF variation. The uncertainty accounting for the mismodeling of the p T spectrum of top quarks is evaluated by varying the two parameters used in the top quark p T reweighting function.",

The uncertainty in the ttV production is taken to be 30%, which covers the uncertainties of the experimental measurements [78,79].

The up and down deviations for each independent uncertainty are assumed to be symmetric in shape, but allowed to differ in the overall size. The symmetrized deviation is smoothed using a version of the LOWESS algorithm (LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing) [81,82]. In the vicinity of each bin of the 2D distribution, the symmetrized deviation is fitted with a plane using a weighted least squares fit, in which nearby bins receive larger weights. The smoothed deviation obtained in this way is rescaled to account for the overall size of the input up or down deviation, and applied to the nominal background expectation in the given bin. A similar procedure is also applied to all signal distributions. The resulting distributions are then used in the subsequent analysis to evaluate the systematic uncertainty under consideration.",

Figure 7 shows scans of \u22122 ln[L(g Att )/L SM ] for this hypothesis, as a function of the coupling modifier g Att . The likelihoods L(g Att ) and L SM are given by eq. (6.1).
