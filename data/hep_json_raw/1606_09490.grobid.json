The events were selected in the dilepton e\u00b5 decay channel with two identified b-jets. The numbers of additional jets for various jet transverse momentum (p T ) thresholds, and the normalised differential cross-sections as a function of p T for the five highest-p T additional jets, were measured in the jet pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.5. The gap fraction, the fraction of events which do not contain an additional jet in a central rapidity region, was measured for several rapidity intervals as a function of the minimum p T of a single jet or the scalar sum of p T of all additional jets. These fractions were also measured in different intervals of the invariant mass of the e\u00b5bb system. All measurements were corrected for detector effects, and found to be mostly well-described by predictions from next-to-leading-order and leading-order tt event generators with appropriate parameter choices. The results can be used to further optimise the parameters used in such generators.",

            "text": "The top quark plays a special role in the Standard Model and in some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The large top quark mass and large tt pair-production crosssection in pp collisions (242 \u00b1 10 pb at \u221a s = 8 TeV [1]) make top quark production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a unique laboratory for studying the behaviour of QCD at the highest accessible energy scales. The decays of top quarks to charged leptons, neutrinos and b-quarks also make such events a primary source of background in many searches for new physics. Therefore, the development of accurate modelling for events involving top quark production forms an important part of the LHC physics programme. Measurements of the activity of additional jets in tt events, i.e. jets not originating from the decay of the top quark and antiquark, but arising from quark and gluon radiation produced in association with the tt system, have been made by ATLAS [2,3] and CMS [4] using pp data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, and by CMS [5] at \u221a s = 8 TeV. These data are typically presented as particlelevel results in well-defined fiducial regions, corrected to remove detector efficiency and JHEP09(2016)074 resolution effects, and compared to the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC) generators through tools such as the Rivet framework [6]. Such comparisons indicate that some state-of-theart generators have difficulties in reproducing the data, whilst for others agreement with data can be improved with an appropriate choice of generator parameter values or 'tune', including those controlling QCD factorisation and renormalisation scales, and matching to the parton shower [7][8][9][10][11].",

The renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to the generator default value of m 2 t + p 2 T , the sum in quadrature of the top quark mass m t and transverse momentum p T , the latter evaluated for the underlying Born configuration before radiation. The Powheg parameter h damp , used in the damping function that limits the resummation of higher-order effects incorporated into the Sudakov form factor, was set to infinity, corresponding to no damping. The top quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. The total tt production cross-section, used when comparing predictions from simulation with data, was taken to be 253 +13 \u221215 pb, based on the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) calculation including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic soft gluon terms as described in refs.

This process is distinct from tt production when considered at leading order. But at NLO in QCD the two processes cannot be separated once the top quarks decay to W b: the resulting W bWb final state can appear for example through both gg \u2192 tt \u2192 W bWb and gg \u2192 W tb \u2192 W bWb, and the two processes interfere to an extent depending on the kinematics of the final state. However, the currently available generators do not allow a full treatment of this interference; instead they consider tt and W t production as separate processes. Within this approximation, the 'diagram removal' and 'diagram subtraction' schemes have been proposed as alternatives for approximately handling the interference between the tt and W t processes [47,48]. For this paper, W t production was simulated as a process separate from tt, using Powheg + Pythia6 with the CT10 PDFs and the P2011C tune. The diagram removal scheme was used as the baseline and the diagram subtraction scheme was used to assess systematic uncertainties. A cross-section of 22.4 \u00b1 1.5 pb was assumed for W t production, determined by using the approximate NNLO prediction described in ref. [49].",

In contrast, the differential jet cross-section measurements require an explicit jet-by-jet matching of particle-level to reconstructed jets. This was achieved by first calculating the \u2206R between each particlelevel jet passing a looser requirement of p T > 10 GeV and each reconstructed b-tagged jet, considering the two with highest MV1 weight if more than two reconstructed jets were b-tagged. Ordering the b-tagged jets by MV1 weight was found to give a greater fraction of correct matches than the jet p T ordering used for the gap fraction measurements, where no jet matching is needed. If the closest reconstructed b-tagged jet was within \u2206R < 0.4, the particle-level and reconstructed jets were considered matched. The procedure was then repeated with the remaining particle-level and reconstructed jets, allowing each particlelevel and reconstructed jet to be matched only once. Reconstructed jets which remained unassociated with particle-level jets after this procedure are referred to as 'unmatched' jets; these originate from single particle-level jets which are split in two at reconstruction level (only one of which is matched), and from pile-up (since particles from pile-up collisions are not considered in the particle-level jet clustering). The contributions from such unmatched jets are shown separately in figure 2.",

The matrix is largely diagonal, showing that jets are most likely to be reconstructed with the correct p T and rank.

The response matrix M is not unitary because in mapping from particle to reconstruction level, some events and objects are lost due to inefficiencies and some are gained due to misreconstruction or migration of objects from outside the fiducial acceptance into the reconstructed distribution. This results in the response matrix being almost singular, and it is therefore not possible to obtain stable unfolded results by inverting the response matrix and applying it to the measured data. Instead, an assumed particle-level distribution (the 'prior') was chosen, the response matrix applied and the resulting trial reconstruction set was compared to the observed reconstruction set. A new prior was then constructed from the old prior and the difference between the trial and the observed distributions. The procedure was iterated until the result became stable. For this analysis, two iterations were found to be sufficient, based on studies of the unfolding performance in simulated samples with reweighted jet p T distributions and from different generators.",

The values of the correction factor C(Q 0 ) (and similarly for Q sum ) deviate by at most 5 % from unity at low Q 0 and Q sum , and approach unity at higher threshold values. The small corrections reflect the high selection efficiency and high purity of the event samples; at each threshold Q 0 , the baseline simulation predicts that around 80 % of the selected reconstructed events that do not have a jet with p T > Q 0 also have no particle-level jet with p T > Q 0 .

The measurements were corrected to the particle level and defined in a fiducial region corresponding closely to the experimental acceptance, facilitating comparisons with the predictions of different Monte Carlo tt event generators. The additional-jet multiplicity for various jet p T thresholds has been measured in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 4.5, together with the normalised differential cross-sections as a function of the first to the fourth jet p T . The gap fraction, the fraction of events with no additional jet above a certain p T threshold, has also been measured in the central rapidity region |y| < 2.1, for subsets of this y region, and as a function of the invariant mass of the e\u00b5bb system. Taken together, these measurements can help to characterise the production of additional jets in tt events, an important test of QCD and a significant source of systematic uncertainty in many measurements and searches for new physics at the LHC. The results will be made available in the HepData repository and through the Rivet analysis framework.",

Both Powheg (interfaced to Pythia6, Pythia8 or Herwig) and MC@NLO + Herwig give good descriptions of the p T spectrum of the first additional jet, although MC@NLO + Herwig does not describe higher jet multiplicities, or the gap fraction as a function of a threshold on the sum of the p T of all additional jets. The leading-order multi-leg generators Alpgen, interfaced to Pythia6 or Herwig, and MadGraph interfaced to Pythia6, are also generally compatible with the data. The predictions of these generators are sensitive to the choice of QCD scale and parton shower parameters, and tuning to the precise measurements presented here offers considerable scope for reducing the range of parameter variations which need to be considered when evaluating tt modelling uncertainties, compared to the ranges derived from previous analyses based on smaller \u221a s = 7 TeV ATLAS data samples.",
