The total production cross-sections and spin configurations of these heavy quarkonium states are currently not reproduced by the theoretical models. These include the colour singlet model [1][2][3][4][5], recently improved by adding higher-order contributions [6,7], the colourevaporation model [8], and the non-perturbative colour octet mechanism [9][10][11], which is investigated in the framework e-mail: Dmytro.Volyanskyy@cern.ch of non-relativistic QCD. The first complete next-to-leading order calculation of \u03d2 production properties [12], based on the non-relativistic QCD factorisation scheme, provides a good description of the measured differential cross-sections at large transverse momentum, p T , but overestimates the data at low p T .",

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4 % at 5 GeV/c to 0.6 % at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with large transverse momentum. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [24].

The distribution is described by a function similar to the one used in the previous studies on \u03d2 production [21,22]. It models the signal component using the sum of three Crystal Ball functions [36], one for each of the \u03d2(1S), \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) signals, and includes an exponential component to account for combinatorial background. The position and width of the Crystal Ball function describing the \u03d2(1S) meson are allowed to vary, while the mass differences between \u03d2 states are fixed to their known values [37] along with parameters describing the radiative tail, as determined from simulation studies. The widths of the \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) peaks are constrained to the value of the width of the \u03d2(1S) signal scaled by the ratio of their masses to the \u03d2(1S) mass. In total, five parameters are extracted from the fit for the signal component: the yields of \u03d2(1S), \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) states, the \u03d2(1S) mass resolution and its peak position. The latter is found to be consistent with the known mass of the \u03d2(1S) meson [37], while reasonable agreement is observed between the data and simulation for the \u03d2(1S) mass resolution.",

            "text": "The single differential cross-sections times dimuon branching fractions are shown as functions of p T and y in Fig. 2 and summarised in Table 2. The total uncertainties of the results are dominated by statistical effects in all p T and y bins. In addition to the data, Fig. 2 reports theoretical predictions, based on the next-to-leading order non-relativistic QCD calculation [18], for the \u03d2 differential cross-sections in the kinematic region 6 < p T < 15 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5. The long-distance matrix elements used in the calculations are fitted to CDF [50] and D0 [51] results for \u03d2(1S) production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.8 and 1.96 TeV. The predictions include the feed-down contributions from higher excited S-wave and P-wave bb states. Good agreement between the data and predictions is found for all three \u03d2 states. The dependence of the \u03d2 cross-sections on y is found to be more pronounced than at higher collision energies [21,22], which is in line with theoretical expectations presented for example in Ref. [52]. Figure 3 illustrates the ratios of the \u03d2(2S) to \u03d2(1S), R 2S/1S , and \u03d2(3S) to \u03d2(1S), R 3S/1S , cross-sections times dimuon branching fractions as functions of p T and y. Here, most of the systematic uncertainties on the cross-sections cancel, while the statistical uncertainties remain significant. The ratios are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding results obtained in the previous analyses on \u03d2 production at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [21,22]. The measured R 2S/1S and R 3S/1S are also consistent with theoretical predictions presented in Refs. [52][53][54], where the \u03d2(3S) meson is considered as a mixture of normal bb and hybrid bbg states. Table 3 lists R 2S/1S and R 3S/1S for each p T and y bin.",
