In the data, the muons are removed from reconstructed \u00b5\u00b5 events and replaced with simulated tau leptons with the same kinematic properties. In this way, a set of hybrid events is obtained that does not rely on simulation except for the decay of the tau leptons. The challenges in describing the underlying event or the production of associated jets in the simulation are avoided. The technique described in this paper was developed for CMS. Its validation and the inherent uncertainties are also discussed. The demonstration of the performance of the technique is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions collected by CMS in 2017 at \u221a s = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb \u22121 .

            "text": "An important background for many measurements at the CERN LHC is the decay of Z bosons into pairs of tau leptons (Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4). Among those measurements are studies of Higgs boson events in the \u03c4\u03c4 [1][2][3][4][5] and WW [6,7] decay channels, and searches for additional supersymmetric and charged Higgs bosons [3,[8][9][10][11][12][13]. This background can be estimated from observed events, using selected Z boson events in the \u00b5\u00b5 final state (Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5). Initially, the method was only used to model events originating from Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decays, which are the most prominent source of \u03c4\u03c4 background events at the LHC. However, all statements made throughout this paper are equally true for other standard model (SM) background processes that decay into two tau leptons. The aim of this method is to model all such processes. In the embedding technique, all energy deposits of the recorded muons are removed from the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events collected by CMS and replaced by the energy deposits of simulated tau lepton decays with the same kinematic properties for the tau leptons as for the removed muons. In this way, a hybrid event is created, comprised of information from both observed and simulated events. The parts of an event that are challenging to describe in the simulation, such as the underlying event or the production of additional jets, are taken directly from observed data. Only the tau lepton decay, which is well understood, relies on the simulation. In Higgs boson analyses, the small coupling strength of the muon with respect to the tau lepton guarantees a negligible contamination by signal events. The Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 selection thus serves as a sideband region for those analyses that rely on this technique, referred to as target analyses in the following. In this picture, the simulation of the tau leptons in place of the removed muons corresponds to the extrapolation into the signal region.",

All lepton flavors are embedded for the validation of the technique. The corresponding application is referred to as e-, \u00b5-, or \u03c4-embedding throughout the text. The \u00b5-embedding holds the special role of validating the technique itself. The e-embedding serves to validate the sophisticated electron identification in CMS, which relies on many detector quantities. Reconstruction efficiencies are determined from each application, using the \"tag-and-probe\" method, as described in ref. [14]. This monitors the level of understanding of the reconstruction of each lepton flavor, and allows us to derive residual correction factors for final use in the target analyses. Since these correction factors are derived for the simulated leptons that have been embedded into the event, they are expected to be similar to the correction factors obtained without the embedding technique. The branching fractions for Z \u2192 ee, Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5, and Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 are equal so the normalizations for all the decays are equal.",

The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [18]. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution, for muons with p T up to 100 GeV, of 1% in the barrel and 3% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 7% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [19]. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of better than 2.5% for |\u03b7| \u2264 1.4. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3 and 4% [20].

Alternatively, the electron track is matched to a PF cluster, while at each intersection with a layer or disc of the tracker a straight line is extrapolated to the ECAL surface, tangent to the electron trajectory, to identify further PF clusters due to bremsstrahlung emission. This approach improves the reconstruction for low p T electrons and electrons in jets. To increase their purity, the reconstructed electrons are required to pass a multivariate electron identification discriminant [18], which combines information on the quality of the differently reconstructed tracks, shower shape, and kinematic quantities.

In the first approach inner and outer tracks are matched by comparing their parameters propagated to a common surface. If a match is found, a global-muon track is fitted combining the hits from both tracks. In a second approach, tracks from the inner tracker are extrapolated to the muon system taking into account the magnetic field, the average expected energy losses, and multiple Coulomb scattering in the detector material. If at least one muon segment (i.e., a short track stub made of drift tube or cathode strip chamber hits) matches the extrapolation, the corresponding track is identified as a muon track. The second approach improves the reconstruction efficiency for muons with p T \u2264 5 GeV, which are unlikely to traverse the entire muon system. For muons within the geometrical acceptance and with sufficiently high p T to reach the muon system, the reconstruction efficiency reaches up to 99%. It is supplemented by specialized algorithms for muons with a p T of several hundreds of GeV. The presence of hits in the muon chambers already leads to a strong suppression of particles misidentified as muons. Additional identification requirements on the track fit quality and the compatibility of individual track segments with the fitted track can reduce the misidentification rate further.

The \u03c4 h reconstruction is performed by further exploiting the substructure of the jets, using the hadrons-plus-strips algorithm described in refs. [31,32]. The decay into three charged hadrons, and the decay into a single charged hadron, accompanied by up to two neutral pions with p T > 2.5 GeV, are used for the target analyses. The neutral pions are reconstructed as strips, i.e., clusters of electron or photon constituents of the seeding jet with stretched energy deposits along the azimuthal direction. The strip size varies as a function of the p T of the electron or photon candidate. The \u03c4 h decay mode is then obtained by combining the charged hadrons with the strips. High-p T tau leptons are expected to be isolated from any hadronic activity in the event, as are high-p T electrons and muons. Furthermore, in accordance with its finite lifetime, the charged decay products of the tau lepton are expected to be slightly displaced from the PV. To distinguish \u03c4 h decays from jets originating from the hadronization of quarks or gluons, a multivariate \u03c4 h identification discriminant is used [32]. It combines information on the hadronic activity in the detector in the vicinity of the \u03c4 h candidate with the reconstructed properties related to the lifetime of the tau lepton. Of the predefined working points given in ref. [32], the tight, medium, and very loose working points are used in the target analyses. These have efficiencies between 27% (tight) and 71% (very loose) for genuine tau leptons, e.g., from Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decays, for quark/gluon misidentification rates of less than 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (tight), and 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 (very loose). Finally, additional discriminants are imposed to reduce the misidentification probability for electrons and muons as \u03c4 h candidates, using predefined working points from ref. [32]. For the discrimination against electrons these working points have identification efficiencies for genuine tau leptons ranging from 65% (tight) to 94% (very loose) for misidentification rates between 6.2\u00d710 \u22124 (tight) and 2.4\u00d710 \u22122 (very loose). For the discrimination against muons the typical \u03c4 h identification efficiency is 99% for a misidentification rate of O(10 \u22123 ).",

To increase the number of simulated events in phase space regions with high jet multiplicity, supplementary samples are generated with up to four outgoing partons in the hard interaction. For diboson production M G 5_a @ is used at next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. For tt and single t quark production samples are generated at NLO precision using v2 [35][36][37][38][39][40][41]. For the generation of all processes the NNPDF3.0 parton distribution functions [42] are used. The simulation of the underlying event is parametrized according to the CUETP8M1 tune [43]. Hadronic showering and hadronization, as well as the \u03c4 decays, are modeled using 8.212 [44]. For all generated events the effect of the PU is included by generating additional inclusive inelastic pp collisions with and adding them to the simulated events according to the expected PU distribution profile in data. Differences between this expectation and the observed PU profile are mitigated by reweighting the simulated events. All events generated are passed through a G 4based [45] simulation of the CMS detector and reconstructed using the same version of the CMS event reconstruction software as used for the data.",

Smaller contributions are expected from Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events, mostly where both tau leptons subsequently decay into muons, and from QCD multijet, tt, and diboson production. Without further correction, the presence of QCD multijet and Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events in the selected event sample leads to an overestimate of the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 event yield and a bias of the m and p T distributions of the embedded leptons towards lower values. This can be inferred from figure 2, where the accumulation of these events is visible for m \u00b5\u00b5 < 70 GeV and p \u00b5 T < 20 GeV. The fraction of QCD multijet and Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events can be significantly suppressed by raising the requirement on m \u00b5\u00b5 to be higher than 70 GeV, at the cost of a loss of \u224813% of selected Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events.

These conditions are met, e.g., in searches for additional Higgs bosons in models beyond the SM [15]. A large fraction of this contribution originates from events where the W bosons e.g., from both t quark decays subsequently decay into a muon and neutrino (tt(\u00b5\u00b5)). The contribution from tt and diboson production in all other modes is below the current accuracy requirements of the method. The substitution of the -9 -JINST 14 P06032 muons by tau leptons provides an additional estimate for tt and diboson production with two tau leptons in the final state from data. This class of events needs to be removed from simulation in the target analyses to prevent double counting.

The broadening of the kinematic distributions of the embedded muons, due to the repeated reconstruction and the finite angular and p T resolution of the detector, and the effects of FSR, have already been discussed in section 5.3. For the following discussion, the simulation of FSR is switched off in the simulation step of the embedding procedure. In this way FSR is simulated only once, during the initial simulation of the validation sample, and all FSR effects are the same for the simulated and the embedded event. Figure 5 shows the \u03b7 and p T distributions of the leading muon in p T , the p miss T , the invariant mass of the two leading jets in p T , m jj , the number of jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.7, and the number of b jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The blue dots correspond to the \u00b5-embedded event sample and the red histogram to the original simulation. The red-shaded bands represent the statistical uncertainty of the simulated event sample that is a reference for the comparison. All distributions are based on exactly the same events, so that the observed differences can exclusively be attributed to the removal and repeated simulation and reconstruction of the embedded muons. The uncertainty bands are added to facilitate the assessment of the observed differences between the compared samples. These differences are considered acceptable if they are compatible with the statistical uncertainty of the validation sample, which is chosen with 10 times more events than the expected number of events in the target analyses.",

The structure in the distributions of the muon \u03b7 follows the geometry of the detector. The Jacobian peak corresponding to the Z boson decay is clearly visible in the p T distribution of the muon. A 5% effect in the ratio is visible for low values of p miss T , which is caused by the finite angular and p T resolution of the detector that can lead to small residual values of p miss T for events with little or no p miss T . Corrections due to the finite momentum resolution of the detector, as described in section 5.3, are not propagated to the p miss T . For \u03c4-embedded events this effect is negligible compared to the kinematic fluctuations related to the neutrinos involved in the decays, as will be discussed in section 6.3. Another 5% effect in the ratio for p miss T > 100 GeV is explained by rare reconstruction effects, where muons of high p T may create additional track segments, e.g., due to multiple scattering in the outer tracker, which are not associated with the initially reconstructed global muon track. After the cleaning step of the embedding procedure, such track segments may be picked up in a different way and thus lead to a different assignment of p miss T . Since the validation is based on simulated Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events, without genuine p miss T , it is clear that such events point to a poor reconstruction of the original event. The fact that this is a 5% effect only for a small fraction of events, and that the size of the effect is small compared to the statistical uncertainty of the validation sample, indicates that it is subdominant to the effect at low p miss T . Figure 6 shows the mean transverse momentum flux per muon, \u2206p T , from all reconstructed particles within the distance R from the muon, split by charged hadrons originating from the PV and PU vertices, photons, and neutral hadrons. It is defined as the average sum of the p T (transverse energy in case of neutral particles) of all corresponding particles between two cones with radii R and R+\u2206R in the distance R from the muon, where \u2206R corresponds to the widths of the histogram bins.

The larger slope for charged hadrons from PU vertices, photons, and neutral hadrons is related to the simulated PU profile and may vary in data. The displayed distributions are shown for the simulated PU profile between 40 and 70 additional inelastic pp collisions. For charged hadrons and photons, the progression from the simulation is well reproduced, apart from small regions close to the muon, -18 -which show a small excess in \u2206p T for charged hadrons from the PV and photons, and a small deficit in \u2206p T for charged hadrons from PU vertices. A larger difference is observed for neutral hadrons, which is due to an incomplete removal of energy deposits of the muon in the HCAL, as discussed in section 5.2. When integrated over R, and all reconstructed particle types, the additional hadronic energy in the predefined isolation cone adds up to less than 200 MeV.",

As discussed in sections 5.3 and 5.4 the simulation of the embedded lepton pair takes place in an otherwise empty detector with no other particles from PU, underlying event, or additional jet production. The tight relation of the electron reconstruction and identification to closely related detector quantities poses an extra challenge to the embedding technique for this lepton flavor, which therefore requires a unique validation procedure. To monitor the success in simulating the distribution of this discriminator and its inputs, e-embedded events are created and compared to a statistically independent sample of simulated Z \u2192 ee events. Figure 7 shows, for the leading electron in p T , the energy-weighted standard deviation of the position of a 5\u00d75 ECAL crystal array in \u03b7 (\u03c3 i\u03b7i\u03b7 ) and \u03c6 (\u03c3 i\u03c6i\u03c6 ), and N GSF , the number of detector hits used for the Gaussian Sum Filter algorithm [27] that is introduced in section 3. The quantities i\u03b7 and i\u03c6 are measured in integer crystal units, such that in a 5\u00d75 array a peripheral crystal can be one or two units away from the central crystal in the array. All quantities are in reasonable agreement given their high sensitivity to the exact geometry, intercalibration, and level of noise suppression of the detector. Also shown is the multivariate discriminator itself (output of the electron-ID boosted decision tree (BDT)), which, among others, has the discussed quantities as input. The vertical arrow added to figure 7 (lower right) corresponds to the 80% working point for the electron identification. Residual differences in the distributions of the electron-ID BDT are comparable to the differences between data and simulation. Correction factors for these differences are derived and applied to the \u03c4-embedded event samples, and are described in section 7.1. In figure 8, the distributions of m ee and the p T of the leading electron are shown. The observed differences are explained by differences in FSR, as discussed in section 5.3. Also shown is the effect of a variation of the electron energy scale by \u00b11%, which is usually applied to the target analyses and fully covers the effect.",

Also shown for these distributions are the effects of a shift of the electron energy scale by \u00b11% and a shift of the tau lepton energy scale by \u00b11.2%, corresponding to the uncertainties usually applied to the target analyses. Differences in the electron and muon \u03b7 are covered by the additional uncertainties in the correction for the geometrical \u00b5\u00b5 detector acceptance.

The effect of a corresponding shift in the electron energy scale is also shown in the corresponding subfigure. The same is true for the p T of the \u03c4 h candidate. More pronounced deviations are visible in the I \u00b5 rel distribution. These are explained by an incomplete removal of the energy deposits of the initially selected muons.

The fact that similar effects are not visible in I e rel can be explained by the different reconstruction of electrons that may associate parts of the remaining energy deposits of the initially selected muons in the calorimeters to the electron clusters, thus removing them from the objects taken into account for the calculation of I e rel . A 20% difference in the highest bin of the \u03c4 h -ID BDT distribution is explained by the reconstruction of tracks in the otherwise empty detector in the simulation step, for \u03c4 h decays with one or three charged and no additional neutral hadrons.

The time needed to produce the \u03c4-embedded event sample is of the order of time necessary to reprocess the collected \u00b5\u00b5 data set. The size of the \u03c4-embedded event sample is 5 to 60 times the size of the data sample used for the target analyses. These are advantages over the simulation that will become even more important for the planned High-Luminosity LHC upgrade, where typically between 140 and 200 PU collisions are expected.",

This signal can be an SM process, such as the SM Z or Higgs boson production in the \u03c4\u03c4 final state, or any other process of physics beyond the SM. In figure 13 the distributions of m vis , as such a variable, in the e\u00b5, e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states are shown, after the event selections, as described above, and after applying a maximum likelihood fit to the observation with the \u03c4-embedded event sample as signal. For this purpose, a likelihood model has been adapted from ref. [46]. It incorporates O(100) uncertainties in form of nuisance parameters that may be correlated across the processes contributing to the input distributions, and across final states. Within a single input distribution -28 -the nuisance parameters may allow for correlated shifts across bins, such as process normalization or energy scale uncertainties, and for shifts of individual bins, within the statistical precision of the template distributions used in the model. The ability of the model to describe the data can be quantified using a goodness-of-fit test, based on a saturated likelihood model (SAT) described in ref. [48], which corresponds to a generalization of a \u03c7 2 test including all systematic uncertainties of the model and their correlations. The SAT test indicates the overall statistical compatibility of the model with the observation, treating each bin of the input distributions as an independent measurement. Goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical distribution function are usually more sensitive than a \u03c7 2 -like test to small deviations that are correlated across several bins of a single histogram. A classical test of this kind that is mostly sensitive to deviations correlated across bins in the center of a given binned distribution is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [49,50]. A variant of this test that gives more emphasis to the edges of the given input distribution is the Anderson-Darling (AD) test [51]. The p-values for each of these tests, split by final state, are shown in table 3. They have a one-to-one correspondence to the distributions shown in figure 13, with the small difference that these distributions are shown for a fit to the observation in all final states combined. The p-values are obtained from the comparison of the observed value for the corresponding test statistic with the outcome of pseudo-experiments based on the expectation. Their statistical precision is better than 0.5%. The actual values range from 17%, for the p-value of the AD test in the e\u03c4 h final state, to 82%, for the p-value of the AD test in the \u00b5\u03c4 h final state. All tests reveal good compatibility of the statistical model with the observation, which implies a successful description of the data with the given template distributions, especially with the \u03c4-embedded event samples. The fit to the observation in all final states combined reveals a p-value of 51% and a normalization of 1.00\u00b1 0.05 0.05 for the \u03c4-embedded event samples, which is in good agreement with the observations of ref. [46] that have been made on an independent data set. Also a good compatibility of the normalization across all final states is observed. The normalization of the \u03c4-embedded samples is obtained from the data. Figures showing distributions of more quantities relevant for the analysis of \u03c4\u03c4 events are given in appendix A.

The 13 TeV proton-proton collisions collected by CMS in 2017 are used to demonstrate the performance of the technique with the data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb \u22121 . The main goal of the procedure is to estimate the background from Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events using recorded Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events. The estimate also includes events from tt and diboson production with two tau leptons in the final state. Recorded \u00b5\u00b5 events are selected, the muons are removed from the reconstructed event record, and replaced with simulated tau leptons with the same kinematic properties as the removed muons. In that way hybrid events are obtained, which rely on the simulation only for the decay of the tau leptons. Challenges in describing the underlying event or the production of associated jets in the simulation, as well as the costly simulation of PU events thus are avoided. The embedding technique decreases the uncertainties inherent in a typical simulation process, such as the uncertainties in the missing transverse momentum, jet energy scale and resolution, b tagging efficiency, and misidentification probability.",
