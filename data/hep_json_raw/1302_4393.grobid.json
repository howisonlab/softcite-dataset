The analysis is an evolution of the process documented in the initial ATLAS luminosity publication [2] and includes an improved determination of the luminosity in 2010 along with a new analysis for 2011. Table 1 highlights the operational conditions of the LHC during 2010 and 2011. The peak instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC at the start of a fill increased from L peak = 2.0 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in 2010 to L peak = 3.6 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 by the end of 2011. This increase results from both an increased instantaneous luminosity delivered per bunch crossing as well as a significant increase in the total number of e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch bunches colliding. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of these two parameters as a function of time. As a result of these changes in operating conditions, the details of the luminosity measurement have evolved from 2010 to 2011, although the overall methodology remains largely the same.",

The luminosity can then be written as L = \u03bc vis n b f r \u03c3 vis (3) where \u03c3 vis = \u03b5\u03c3 inel is the total inelastic cross-section multiplied by the efficiency \u03b5 of a particular detector and algorithm, and similarly \u03bc vis = \u03b5\u03bc. Since \u03bc vis is an experimentally observable quantity, the calibration of the luminosity scale for a particular detector and algorithm is equivalent to determining the visible cross-section \u03c3 vis . The majority of the algorithms used in the ATLAS luminosity determination are event counting algorithms, where each particular bunch crossing is categorized as either passing or not passing a given set of criteria designed to detect the presence of at least one inelastic pp collision. In the limit \u03bc vis 1, the average number of visible inelastic interactions per bunch crossing is given by the simple expression \u03bc vis \u2248 N/N BC where N is the number of bunch crossings (or events) passing the selection criteria that are observed during a given time interval, and N BC is the total number of bunch crossings in that same interval. As \u03bc vis increases, the probability that two or more pp interactions occur in the same bunch crossing is no longer negligible (a condition referred to as \"pile-up\"), and \u03bc vis is no longer linearly related to the raw event count N . Instead \u03bc vis must be calculated taking into account Poisson statistics, and in some cases instrumental or pile-up-related effects. In the limit where all bunch crossings in a given time interval contain an event, the event counting algorithm no longer provides any useful information about the interaction rate.",

Rather than counting how many bunch crossings pass some minimum criteria for containing at least one inelastic interaction, in hit counting algorithms the number of detector readout channels with signals above some predefined threshold is counted. This provides more information per event, and also increases the \u03bc vis value at which the algorithm saturates compared to an event-counting algorithm. The extreme limit of hit counting algorithms, achievable only in detectors with very fine segmentation, are particle counting algorithms, where the number of individual particles entering a given detector is counted directly. More details on how these different algorithms are defined, as well as the procedures for converting the observed event or hit rate into the visible interaction rate \u03bc vis , are discussed in Sect. 4.",

            "text": "A fundamental ingredient of the ATLAS strategy to assess and control the systematic uncertainties affecting the absolute luminosity determination is to compare the measurements of several luminosity detectors, most of which use more than one algorithm to assess the luminosity. These multiple detectors and algorithms are characterized by significantly different acceptance, response to pile-up, and sensitivity to instrumental effects and to beam-induced backgrounds. In particular, since the calibration of the absolute luminosity scale is established in dedicated vdM scans which are carried out relatively infrequently (in 2011 there was only one set of vdM scans at \u221a s = 7 TeV for the entire year), this calibration must be assumed to be constant over long periods and under different machine conditions. The level of consistency across the various methods, over the full range of single-bunch luminosities and beam conditions, and across many months of LHC operation, provides valuable cross-checks as well as an estimate of the detectorrelated systematic uncertainties. A full discussion of these is presented in Sects. 6-8. The information needed for most physics analyses is an integrated luminosity for some well-defined data sample. The basic time unit for storing luminosity information for physics use is the Luminosity Block (LB). The boundaries of each LB are defined by the ATLAS Central Trigger Processor (CTP), and in general the duration of each LB is one minute. Trigger configuration changes, such as prescale changes, can only happen at luminosity block boundaries, and data are analysed under the assumption that each luminosity block contains data taken under uniform conditions, including luminosity. The average luminosity for each detector and algorithm, along with a variety of general ATLAS data quality information, is stored for each LB in a relational database. To define a data sample for physics, quality criteria are applied to select LBs where conditions are acceptable, then the average luminosity in that LB is multiplied by the LB duration to provide the integrated luminosity delivered in that LB. Additional corrections can be made for trigger deadtime and trigger prescale factors, which are also recorded on a per-LB basis. Adding up the integrated luminosity delivered in a specific set of luminosity blocks provides the integrated luminosity of the entire data sample.",

Sixteen mechanically polished aluminium tubes filled with C 4 F 10 gas surround the beampipe on each side of the IP at a distance of 17 m, covering the pseudorapidity range 5.6 < |\u03b7| < 6.0. The Cherenkov photons created by charged particles in the gas are reflected by the tube walls until they reach photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) situated at the back end of the tubes. Additional Cherenkov photons are produced in the quartz window separating the aluminium tubes from the PMTs. The Cherenkov light created in the gas typically produces 60-70 photoelectrons per incident charged particle, while the quartz window adds another 40 photoelectrons to the signal. If one of the LUCID PMTs produces a signal over a preset threshold (equivalent to 15 photoelectrons), a \"hit\" is recorded for that tube in that bunch crossing. The LUCID hit pattern is processed by a custom-built electronics card which contains Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This card can be programmed with different luminosity algorithms, and provides separate luminosity measurements for each LHC bunch crossing.",

These FPGA-based front-end electronics run autonomously from the main data acquisition system, and in particular are not affected by any deadtime imposed by the CTP. 2 The Inner Detector vertex data and the MBTS data are components of the events read out through the data acquisition system, and so must be corrected for deadtime imposed by the CTP in order to measure delivered luminosity. Normally this deadtime is below 1 %, but can occasionally be larger. Since not every inelastic collision event can be read out through the data acquisition system, the bunch crossings are sampled with a random or minimum bias trigger. While the triggered events uniformly sample every bunch crossing, the trigger bandwidth devoted to random or minimum bias triggers is not large enough to measure the luminosity separately for each bunch pair in a given LHC fill pattern during normal physics operations. For special running conditions such as the vdM scans, a custom trigger with partial event readout has been introduced in 2011 to record enough events to allow bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurements from the Inner Detector vertex data.",

Both the LUCID and BCM detectors observe some small activity in the BCIDs immediately following a collision which tends to die away to some baseline value with several different time constants. This \"afterglow\" is most Fig. 3 Average observed luminosity per BCID from BCMV_EventOR in the May 2011 vdM scan. In addition to the 14 large spikes in the BCIDs where two bunches are colliding, induced \"afterglow\" activity can also be seen in the following BCIDs. Single-beam background signals are also observed in BCIDs corresponding to unpaired bunches (24 in each beam) likely caused by photons from nuclear de-excitation, which in turn is induced by the hadronic cascades initiated by pp collision products. The level of the afterglow background is observed to be proportional to the luminosity in the colliding BCIDs, and in the vdM scans this background can be estimated by looking at the luminosity signal in the BCID immediately preceding a colliding bunch pair. A second background contribution comes from activity correlated with the passage of a single beam through the detector. This \"singlebeam\" background, seen in Fig. 3 as the numerous small spikes at the 10 26 cm \u22122 s \u22121 level, is likely a combination of beam-gas interactions and halo particles which intercept the luminosity detectors in time with the main beam. It is observed that this single-beam background is proportional to the bunch charge present in each bunch, and can be considerably different for beams 1 and 2, but is otherwise uniform for all bunches in a given beam. The single-beam background underlying a collision BCID can be estimated by measuring the single-beam backgrounds in unpaired bunches and correcting for the difference in bunch charge between the unpaired and colliding bunches. Adding the single-beam backgrounds measured for beams 1 and 2 then gives an estimate for the single-beam background present in a colliding BCID. Because the single-beam background does not depend on the luminosity, this background can dominate the observed luminosity response when the beams are separated.",

Comparing Figs. 4 and 5 for the May 2011 scans, it is clear that some of the variation seen in \u03c3 vis is not statistical in nature, but rather is correlated by BCID. As discussed in Sect. 6, the RMS variation of \u03c3 vis between BCIDs within a given scan is taken as a systematic uncertainty in the calibration technique, as is the reproducibility of \u03c3 vis between scans. The yellow band in these figures, which represents a range of \u00b10.9 %, shows the quadrature sum of these two systematic uncertainties. Similar results are found in the final scans taken in 2010, although with only 6 colliding bunch pairs there are fewer independent measurements to compare.",

Since this quantity depends only on the convolved beam sizes, consistent results should be measured by all methods for a given scan. Figure 6 shows the measured L spec values by BCID and scan for LUCID and BCMV algorithms, as well as the ratio of these values in the May 2011 scans. Bunch-to-bunch variations of the specific luminosity are typically 5-10 %, reflecting bunch-to-bunch differences in transverse emittance also seen during normal physics fills. For each BCID, however, all algorithms are statistically consistent. A small systematic reduction in L spec can be observed between scans VII and VIII, which is due to emittance growth in the colliding beams.  Figures 7 and 8 show the \u03a3 x and \u03a3 y values determined by the BCM algorithms during scans VII and VIII, and for each BCID a clear increase can be seen with time. This emittance growth can also be seen clearly as a reduction in the peak specific interaction rate \u03bc MAX vis /(n 1 n 2 ) shown in Fig. 9 for BCMV_EventOR. Here the peak rate is shown for each of the four individual horizontal and vertical scans, and a monotonic decrease in rate is generally observed as each individual scan curve is recorded. The fact that the \u03c3 vis values are consistent between scan VII and scan VIII demonstrates that to first order the emittance growth cancels out of the measured luminosity calibration factors. The residual uncertainty associated with emittance growth is discussed in Sect. 6.",

The statistical uncertainty on each measurement is approximately the size of the marker Each beam is also monitored by two fast beam-current transformers (FBCT) which have the ability to measure bunch currents individually for each of the 3564 nominal 25 ns slots in each beam. The relative fraction of the total current in each BCID can be determined from the FBCT system, but this relative measurement must be normalized to the overall current scale provided by the DCCT. Additional corrections are made for any out-of-time charge that may be present in a given BCID but not colliding at the interaction point. The DCCT baseline offset is the dominant uncertainty on the bunch population product in early 2010. The DCCT is known to have baseline drifts for a variety of reasons including temperature effects, mechanical vibrations, and electromagnetic pick-up in cables. For each vdM scan fill the baseline readings for each beam (corresponding to zero current) must be determined by looking at periods with no beam immediately before and after each fill. Because the baseline offsets vary by at most \u00b10.8 \u00d7 10 9 protons in each beam, the relative uncertainty from the baseline determination decreases as the total circulating currents go up. So while this is a significant uncertainty in scans I-III, for the remaining scans which were taken at higher beam currents, this uncertainty is negligible.",

To determine this beam-separation length scale, dedicated length scale calibration measurements are performed close in time to each vdM scan set using the same collision-optics configuration at the interaction point. Length scale scans are performed by displacing the beams in collision by five steps over a range of up to \u00b13\u03c3 b . Because the beams remain in collision during these scans, the actual position of the luminous region can be reconstructed with high accuracy using the primary vertex position reconstructed by the ATLAS tracking detectors.

The five different scans taken in 2010 have different systematic uncertainties, and the combination process used to determine a single \u03c3 vis value is described in Sect. 6.2.

This simulation, which allows for a crossing angle in both planes, is performed for each scan step to predict the geometry of the luminous region, along with the produced luminosity. Since the position and shape of the luminous region during a beam-separation scan varies depending on the single-beam parameters [21], the simulation parameters are adjusted to provide a reasonable description of the mean and RMS width of the luminous region observed at each scan step in the May 2011 scans VII-IX (including the offset scan). Luminosity profiles are then generated for simulated vdM scans using these tuned beam parameters, and analysed in the same fashion as the real vdM scan data, which assumes factorization. The impact of a small non-factorization in the single-beam distributions is determined from the difference between the 'true' luminosity from the simulated overlap integral at zero beam separation and the 'measured' luminosity from the luminosity profile fits. This difference is 0.1-0.2 % for the May 2011 scans, depending on the fitting model used. The number of events with vertex data recorded during the 2010 vdM scans is not sufficient to perform a similar analysis for those scans.",

Because the same covariance matrix is used in all combinations aside from the small statistical component, the relative weighting of the five scan points is almost identical for all methods. Here detailed results are given for the LUCID_EventOR combination. Because most of the uncorrelated uncertainties were significantly reduced from scans I-III to scans IV-V, the values from the last two vdM scans dominate the combination. Scans IV and V contribute a weight of 45 % each, while the other three scans make up the remaining 10 % of the weighted average value. The total uncertainty on the LUCID_EventOR combination represents a relative error of \u00b13.4 %, and is nearly identical to the uncertainty quoted for scans IV-V alone in Table 6. Applying the beam-beam corrections described in Sect. 5.8, which only affect scans IV-V in 2010, changes the best estimate of \u03c3 vis by +1.9 % compared to making no corrections to the 2010 calibrations. Figure 11 shows the agreement among the algorithms within each scan in 2010 by plotting the deviations of the ratios \u03c3 vis /\u03c3 vis (LUCID_EventOR) for several algorithms from the mean value of these ratios, \u03c3 vis /\u03c3 vis (LUCID_ EventOR). By construction, any variation between scans related to the bunch population product n 1 n 2 cancels out, and the remaining scatter reflects the variation between algorithms in measuring \u03bc MAX vis \u03a3 x \u03a3 y . The observed variation is mostly consistent with the statistical uncertainties, and the observed variation of up to \u00b12 % is consistent with the systematic uncertainty assigned to scans I-III for \u03bc dependence. No evidence for any additional source of significant systematic uncertainty between the algorithms is apparent. The \u03c3 vis values determined in Sect. 6 allow each calibrated algorithm to provide luminosity measurements over the course of the 2010 and 2011 runs. Several additional effects due to the LHC operating with a large number of bunches and large \u03bc values must be considered for the 2011 data, however, and additional uncertainties related to the extrapolation of the vdM scan calibration to the complete data sample must be evaluated. Several specific corrections are described in this section for the 2011 data, while more general uncertainties, related to the agreement and stability of the various luminosity methods applicable to both 2010 and 2011, are described in Sect. 8.",

It is observed that the simple afterglow subtraction over-corrects for the afterglow background in the BCMH_EventOR algorithm by approximately 0.2 %, although for the BCMV_EventOR algorithm the method works better. A systematic uncertainty of \u00b10.2 % is assigned to cover any possible bias on the BCMV_EventOR luminosity. The LUCID_EventOR algorithm is over-corrected by around 0.5 %, and this bias is removed by applying a constant scale factor to the LUCID luminosity measurements.

The TileCal pedestals are explicitly measured using data taken at the start of the fill before the beams are put into collision, and the pedestal-corrected Tile-Cal currents are assumed to be directly proportional to the luminosity (with no constant offset). The LUCID luminosity at the peak of the vdM scan, which is itself calibrated by the scan at that point in time, is simply used to set the proportionality constant for each TileCal cell. These few calibrated cells are then compared to other TileCal cells in a fill shortly after the vdM scan when the luminosity is in the range 100-200 \u00d7 10 30 cm \u22122 s \u22121 which is high enough to produce a reasonable current in all cells. The proportionality constants for these remaining cells are determined by comparing the pedestal-corrected currents to the luminosity measured by the subset of cells which were directly calibrated during the vdM scan. This two-stage calibration is necessary because the total luminosity during the vdM scan is too low to provide reasonable currents to all of the TileCal cells used to measure luminosity.

Because the number of colliding bunches increased rather monotonically during both the 2010 and 2011 data-taking periods, it is not possible to disentangle these two effects, so the tests of long-term stability should be viewed as covering both possibilities. Figure 14 shows the interaction rate ratio of a given algorithm to the reference algorithm as a function of time in 2011. Each point shows the average number of interactions per bunch crossing measured by a particular algorithm divided by the number measured by BCMV_EventOR, averaged over one ATLAS run. The average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \u03bc , is the number of interactions per bunch \u03bc averaged over all BCIDs with colliding bunch pairs, and must be used for any comparison with TileCal or FCal. The figure shows the relative variation of this ratio over time compared to a single fill in September which is used to provide a reference point, and comes approximately four months after the vdM scan in May.

The TileCal luminosity is observed to undergo a slow drift with respect to BCMV_EventOR at the level of 1 % over the course of 2011. In contrast to the FCal, this variation has been shown not to be dependent on luminosity, but rather is likely due to residual PMT gain variations which are not corrected by the TileCal laser calibration system.",

The linearity consistency is assessed by looking for a slope in the luminosity ratio with respect to the reference algorithm BCMV_EventOR. All of the algorithms show good linearity from the \u03bc value where the vdM scan is performed (around \u03bc = 2) up to the \u03bc value observed Fig. 16 Fractional deviation of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing \u03bc (averaged over BCIDs) obtained using different algorithms from the BCMV_EventOR value as a function of \u03bc . Data shown are taken during a \u03bc-scan, where the beams are purposely separated to sample a large \u03bc range under similar conditions. Statistical uncertainties are shown per point, but generally are negligible for \u03bc > 2 in nominal physics operations (here around \u03bc = 10). A deviation of around 1 % is observed in the FCal luminosity over this range, which is consistent with the dependence on total luminosity also observed in Fig. 15. The TileCal data agree very well with BCM, which is significant since the TileCal luminosity scale is cross-calibrated to LUCID_EventOR during the vdM scan taken four months earlier. The LUCID_EventOR data also agree with BCM at the \u00b10.5 % level, while LUCID_EventAND deviates by a few percent at the lowest luminosity values. This is interpreted as an imperfect subtraction of the single-beam background which is complicated by the presence of afterglow in this physics-based LHC filling pattern. Deviations of LU-CID_EventAND are not observed at low luminosity in the vdM scan, shown in Fig. 10, where the background correction can be performed more accurately. The vertex counting data are also shown in Fig. 16 for the two BCIDs which were recorded with a special trigger during this time. The vertex luminosity increases by about 1 % over the range of this figure, which is consistent with the additional systematic uncertainties on the vertex counting technique. These uncertainties, related to the vertex masking and fake vertex corrections, grow with the interaction rate and are estimated to reach \u00b12 % by an interaction rate of \u03bc = 10.",

The vdM scan calibration uncertainty has been separated into the uncertainty on the bunch population product and the uncertainties from all other sources der Meer (vdM) scans. Systematic uncertainties on the absolute luminosity calibration have been evaluated. For the 2010 calibrations, the uncertainty is dominated by the understanding of the bunch charge product, while for 2011 the uncertainty is mostly due to the accuracy of the vdM calibration procedure. Additional uncertainties are evaluated to assess the stability of the calibrated luminosity scale over time and over variation in operating conditions, most notably the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The combination of these systematic uncertainties results in a final uncertainty on the ATLAS luminosity scale during pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV of \u03b4L/L = \u00b13.5 % for the 47 pb \u22121 of data delivered to ATLAS in 2010 and \u03b4L/L = \u00b11.8 % for the 5.5 fb \u22121 delivered in 2011. These results include explicit corrections for beam-beam effects in the vdM calibration scans that were not understood until late in the luminosity analysis and were therefore not applied to the luminosity scale used in any ATLAS publication prior to July of 2013. Consequently, the luminosity scale used in previous ATLAS results should be scaled down by 1.9 % in 2010 and 1.4 % in 2011.",
