The analysis [14] is based on the same data sample, events selection and jet reconstruction used for the previously described dijet resonances search [3]. Figure 3 shows the predicted and observed values of R \u03b7 a a function of the dijet mass m jj . The measured R \u03b7 is nearly flat with a value of about 0.5, as predicted by QCD, while the presence of quark contact interactions would lead to an increase of R \u03b7 above a value of m jj that depends on the compositeness energy scale \u039b.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of heavy (quasi-)stable charged particles (HSCPs), that would travel across the size of typical particle detector [2], and could be observable as high momentum (p) particles with exceptional ionization energy loss (dE/dx).  The CMS search [17] is based on an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb \u22121 , and has two approaches. A \"tracker-only\" selection looks for charged particles in the inner tracker with large dE/dx and p T . A \"tracker-plus-muon\" selection additionally requires associated hits in the outer muon detectors. For both selections, the mass of the candidate is estimated from the measured p and dE/dx. For candidate tracks with |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 15 GeV/c, an estimator I as of the degree of compatibility of the observed charge measurements in the silicon detector with the minimumionizing particle (MIP) hypothesis is used to point out non-relativistic HSCP candidates. The data and Monte Carlo (MC) normalized distributions of p T and I as for pre-selected trackeronly candidates are shown in Figure 7. One MC sample contains events from standard QCD processes, while the second MC sample contains signal events from pair-production of stable g with a mass of 200 GeV/c 2 . Both samples are generated with PYTHIA [6]. The mass of the candidates is extracted from the measured dE/dx and p values, inverting a parametrized Bethe-Bloch fitted from data. The search is performed as a counting experiment with candidates required to have I as and p T greater than threshold values, and the candidates mass to be in the range of 75 to 2000 GeV/c 2 .",

Therefore cross section upper limits at the 95% CL are set on the HSCP production for two benchmark scenarios: direct production of g pairs andt 1 pairs. The signal efficiencies depend on the hadronization fractions and interactions of the resulting signal R-hadrons. A summary of cross section upper limits, set with a Bayesian method, are shown in Figure 8. The trackerplus-muon selection set a 95% CL lower mass limit of 398 GeV/c 2 for long-lived g with a f = 0.1 fraction of R-gluonball states, and of 202 GeV/c 2 for long-livedt 1 .
