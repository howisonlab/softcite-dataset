The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018. The production cross-section for the process pp \u2192 + \u2212 \u03b3 + X ( = e, \u00b5) is measured within a fiducial phase-space region defined by kinematic requirements on the photon and the leptons, and by isolation requirements on the photon. An experimental precision of 2.9% is achieved for the fiducial cross-section. Differential crosssections are measured as a function of each of six kinematic variables characterising the + \u2212 \u03b3 system. The data are compared with theoretical predictions based on next-toleading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations. The impact of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections is also considered.",

The analysis of the neutrino channel allowed improved limits to be placed on anomalous ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings which can arise in extensions of the SM [18]. The analysis presented here uses the full ATLAS Run 2 dataset, with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 , to measure the Z\u03b3 production crosssection for events in which the Z boson decays into an electron or muon pair, Z \u2192 + \u2212 ( = e, \u00b5). Compared with the neutrino channel, the + \u2212 \u03b3 channel allows cross-section measurements to be made over a wider range of E \u03b3 T and with lower background, but with reduced sensitivity to anomalous gauge-boson couplings [2,19].",

The m( ) distribution for selected + \u2212 \u03b3 events thus displays a dominant resonant peak centred on the Z boson mass, above a smaller, non-resonant component due to the presence of virtual photon exchange. The contribution from events in which the selected photon is produced from the fragmentation of a quark or a gluon, as illustrated in figures 1(c) and 1(d), is suppressed experimentally by requiring that the photon be unaccompanied by significant activity from other particles in the event (isolation), and removed theoretically by imposing smooth-cone isolation criteria on the photon at parton level [20].",

The simulated samples were produced with various MC event generators, processed through a full ATLAS detector simulation [29] based on Geant4 [30], and reconstructed with the same software as used for the data. All MC samples are corrected with data-driven correction factors to account for differences in photon and lepton trigger, reconstruction, identification and isolation performance between data and simulation. Additional pp interactions (pile-up) occurring in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings were modelled by overlaying each MC event with minimum-bias events generated using Pythia 8.186 [31] with the A3 set of tuned parameters [32] and the NNPDF2.3 LO [33] set of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The MC events were then reweighted to reproduce the distribution of the number of pp interactions per bunch crossing observed in the data.",

[20]. This removes contributions in which the photon is produced from quark or gluon fragmentation (figures 1(c) and 1(d)) in a way which is infrared safe to all orders of perturbation theory. The smooth-cone isolation prescription considers a cone of variable opening angle \u03b4, with maximum opening angle \u03b4 0 , centred around the photon direction, and requires that the summed transverse energy of partons inside the cone is always less than a specified fraction of E \u03b3 T .

The probability that a photon converts in the pixel detector and is reconstructed as a pixel conversion is expected to be approximately independent of whether the photon is produced in the primary or a pile-up interaction. However, the reconstruction efficiency for conversions is weakly dependent on the photon energy [59], and differences between the prompt photon energy spectra for pile-up and single-pp processes could result in a difference between the corresponding fractions of pixel conversion events.

The Matrix, Sherpa and MadGraph NLO predictions, although formally of the same order, cannot be compared directly as the latter two are based on multi-leg MC event generators which include additional LO processes producing hard QCD radiation. The measured cross-section is about 3% higher than the prediction from Matrix at NNLO, and consistent with it within about 0.7\u03c3. The correction to the predicted Matrix crosssection at NNLO compared to NLO is about +17%, and is significantly larger than the scale uncertainty estimated at NLO. Such an effect is discussed in ref. [73], where it is noted that, due to LO kinematic effects, the higher-order correction is enhanced by increasing the requirement on E \u03b3 T . Table 6 also gives the Matrix NNLO cross-sections as modified by the multiplicative and additive NLO EW corrections, as discussed in section 7. NLO EW radiative corrections are predicted to reduce the Matrix NNLO cross-section by as much as about \u22121%, although with a large uncertainty, as illustrated by the difference between applying the qq component of the EW corrections multiplicatively or additively, which produce shifts of \u22128.2 fb and \u22123.4 fb respectively, in addition to smaller shifts of +2.5 fb and +0.3 fb from \u03b3\u03b3-and q\u03b3-induced production.

The relative precision of the differential cross-section measurements is in the range 3-7% in all bins, except for the highest two bins in E \u03b3 T where, due to the limited number of events in data, it approaches about 15%.
