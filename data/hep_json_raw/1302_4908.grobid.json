The data used for this measurement were taken in 2010 and 2011, with a total of 10.8 \u00d7 10 19 protons-on-target. The analysis is performed on 4485 inclusive charged current interaction candidates selected in the most upstream fine-grained scintillator detector of the near detector. The flux-averaged total cross section is \u03c3CC \u03c6 = (6.91 \u00b1 0.13(stat) \u00b1 0.84(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u221239 cm 2 nucleon for a mean neutrino energy of 0.85 GeV.",

Many modern neutrino oscillation experiments like SciBooNE, MiniBooNE and T2K use heavier targets rich in carbon (and/or oxygen). Nuclear effects are important for those targets and, consequently, the neutrino interaction cross sections are not well known. It is therefore important to measure and understand these interactions to minimize systematic uncertainties for the oscillation measurement.",

An unfolding method that corrects for detector resolution, efficiencies and backgrounds is used to extract the fluxaveraged total cross section and differential cross section in muon momentum and angle. The cross-section extraction technique requires a detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation including the neutrino flux prediction (Sec. II B), a complete neutrino interaction model (Sec. III), full description of the near detector and accurate simulation of the readout electronics. The neutrino event generator NEUT [4] is used in the calculations of the selection efficiency for signal events and the rate of background events in the analysis. Additionally, a different event generator, GENIE [5], is used for cross-checks and for fake data studies. Finally, the results of this analysis are compared with the predictions of the NEUT and GENIE generators.",

The proton beam has 8 bunches (6 before June 2010) with a 581 ns spacing. The protons in the spill are extracted and directed toward a 91.4 cm long graphite target aligned 2.5 \u2022 off-axis angle from Kamioka. The target is installed inside a magnetic horn that collects and focuses the positively charged mesons (mainly pions and kaons) generated by proton interactions in the target. Two additional magnetic horns are used to further focus the charged mesons before they enter a 96 m long steel decay volume filled with helium. The mesons decay predominately into highly boosted muons and muon neutrinos, which propagate roughly in the direction of the decaying mesons. A beam dump stops most of the particles in the beam that are not neutrinos. Some high-energy muons pass through the beam dump and are observed by the muon monitor, providing information used to track the beam direction and stability. The analysis presented in this paper uses the data taken before March 2011, comprising a total of 10.8\u00d710 19 protons-on-target (POT).",

Some specific interactions such as NC elastic scattering, charm production and neutrino-electron elastic scattering are not discussed in this paper due to their irrelevance to this analysis. We refer to [4,5] for the details. Both generators use the Llewellyn Smith formalism [19] for quasi-elastic (QE) scattering. In this model the hadronic weak current is expressed in terms of the most general Lorentz-invariant form factors which do not violate G-parity: namely two vector form factors, one pseudo-scalar form factor and one axial form factor. The vector form factors are measured over a broad range of kinematics in electron elastic scattering experiments and are fixed by the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis. The pseudo-scalar form factor is assumed to have the form suggested by the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) hypothesis [19]. This leaves the axial form factor F A (Q 2 ) as the sole remaining unknown quantity. The value of the axial form factor at Q 2 = 0, F A (0), is well known from measurements of neutron beta decay and the Q 2 dependence of this form factor can only be determined in neutrino experiments. In both generators, a dipole form factor is assumed with an axial mass, M QE A , of 0.99 GeV/c 2 for GENIE and 1.21 GeV/c 2 for NEUT.",

The values of p F and E B are measured from electron scattering for each target nucleus species individually. While NEUT uses the analytical expressions from the Smith-Moniz [20] model, GENIE incorporates short range nucleon-nucleon correlations in the RFG model and handles kinematics for off-shell scattering according to the model of Bodek and Ritchie [21]. For GENIE, the Rein-Sehgal model is used up to a hadronic invariant mass of 1.7 GeV/c 2 , while the analogous cutoff is 2 GeV/c 2 for NEUT.

In both generators, Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling [33] is used to determine the charged hadron multiplicity. Below 1.7 GeV/c 2 , GENIE uses the Andreopoulos-Gallagher-Kehayias- Yang (AGKY) hadronization model [34] to decompose the Bodek and Yang model into single pion and two pion production contributions. A fraction of these CC-1\u03c0 and CC-2\u03c0 contributions are added to the Rein-Sehgal resonance model. The fractions are derived from fits to CC inclusive, CC-1\u03c0 and CC-2\u03c0 bubble chamber data. The corresponding fractions for NC are worked out from the CC fractions using isospin arguments.",

The major contribution to the SF comes from the shell model and the remaining \u223c20% from correlated pairs of nucleons. The latter part accounts for a high momentum tail in the nucleon momentum distribution, which extends far beyond the Fermi momentum. The effective binding energy (equivalent to E B in the Fermi gas model) is on average larger which makes the cross section smaller for the SF implementation as compared to RFG. The fractional difference in CCQE event yields calculated with the RFG model and the SF is used to set the uncertainty in each bin of reconstructed muon momentum and angle. Because the uncertainty on the Fermi momentum is large enough to have a non-negligible effect on the shape of the Q 2 spectrum for CCQE events, a systematic error on the Fermi momentum is added over and above the systematic uncertainty assigned using the spectral function comparison. In this case, the uncertainty on the Fermi momentum is taken from electron scattering data [20] and increased to cover MiniBooNE data at low Q 2 .

In this analysis, however, we assume them to be independent, as a first approximation. Therefore, the uncertainty on the FSI contribution is added in quadrature to the other sources in the reported cross section (see Sec. V A). The uncertainties on the parameters that scale the microscopic interaction probabilities are shown in Table V. They have been estimated from comparison to external \u03c0 \u2212 12 C scattering data [37]. At the core of this analysis is the reconstruction and event selection in the MC and the data, as described in detail in this section. In this analysis, we select CC inclusive candidates by identifying negatively charged muoncandidate tracks in the tracker. The number of selected events in reconstructed bins is used to infer the number of true events and, consequently, the CC inclusive cross section, as described in Sec. V. The selected events in each bin are dependent on the reconstruction and detection efficiency. Below, in Sec. IV A, we first review how the various pieces of MC simulation are included in the final MC. Sec. IV B explains in more detail how the tracks are reconstructed in the TPCs and FGDs. The event selection, described in Sec. IV C, relies on these reconstructed tracks. The performance of the event selection and reconstruction is provided in Sec. IV D along with a data-MC comparison. Finally, a discussion of the detector response systematic uncertainty is given in Sec. IV E, while Sec. V describes how the detector uncertainties are then propagated to the final cross section.",

In Figs. 6 and 7, the efficiency as a function of muon momentum and angle are shown as estimated from NEUT and GENIE MC simulations. The efficiency for backward-going muons is very low since the reconstruction does not attempt to reconstruct backwardgoing tracks. The non-zero efficiency for backward-going muons arises from the reconstruction of events with a forward-going pion possessing a negative charge that is misidentified as a negatively charged muon, while the real muon is going backwards. This effect is included in the cross-section determination of Sec. V B.",

As demonstrated in [50], reconstructed and true bins do not necessarily have to be the same. As seen previously, this analysis does not attempt to reconstruct backward-going muons and all events in the cos \u03b8 interval between \u22121 and 0.84 have been placed into a single bin (see Table X). As shown in Fig. 7, there is almost no efficiency for the backward-going angle. We therefore split the true cos \u03b8 bins into a truly backward bin [-1,0] and a more forward bin [0,0.84]. We will determine the double differential cross section in the forward direction only, while the total cross section is extrapolated into the backward direction using the MC and Bayes' theorem.

In addition, these results have been used to calculate a flux-averaged total CC inclusive cross section that is consistent with previous measurements in this energy range. The data related to this measurement can be found electronically in [53]. The predictions for SciBooNE have been done for a C8H8 target [51] which is comparable to the mixed T2K target.
