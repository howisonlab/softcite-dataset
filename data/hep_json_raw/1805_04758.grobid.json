            "text": "A search is presented for pair production of heavy vector-like T and B quarks in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. Pair production of T quarks would result in a wide range of final states, since vector-like T quarks of charge 2e/3 are predicted to decay to bW, tZ, and tH. Likewise, vector-like B quarks are predicted to decay to tW, bZ, and bH. Three channels are considered, corresponding to final states with a single lepton, two leptons with the same sign of the electric charge, or at least three leptons. The results exclude T quarks with masses below 1140-1300 GeV and B quarks with masses below 910-1240 GeV for various branching fraction combinations, extending the reach of previous CMS searches by 200-600 GeV.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] (H) has further encouraged searches for new physics at the CERN LHC. Potentially divergent loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass require either significant fine tuning of the standard model (SM) parameters or new particles at the TeV scale. The existence of heavy top quark partners is particularly well motivated to cancel the largest corrections from SM top quark loops. In supersymmetric theories bosonic partners of the top quark serve this purpose, but in several other theories, such as little Higgs [4,5] or composite Higgs [6][7][8][9] models, this role is filled by fermionic top quark partners. These heavy quark partners interact predominantly with the third generation of the SM quarks [10,11] and have vector-like transformation properties under -1 -JHEP08(2018)177  the SM gauge group SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y \u00d7 SU(3) C , inspiring the name \"vector-like quarks\" (VLQs). A heavy fourth generation of chiral quarks has been excluded by precision electroweak measurements from electron-positron collisions [12,13] and by the measurement of Higgs-boson-mediated cross sections [14,15], but VLQs are not excluded by these experimental data.",

Our search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector in 2016. Many models in which VLQs appear assume that T quarks may decay to three final states: bW, tZ, or tH [16], as illustrated by the diagrams in figure 1. The partial decay widths depend on the particular model [17], but for VLQ masses significantly larger than the W boson mass, as considered here, an electroweak singlet T quark is expected to have branching fractions (B) of 50% for T \u2192 bW, and 25% for both T \u2192 tZ and tH [17,18]. A doublet T quark decays only to tZ and tH, each with 50% branching fraction. Although this search is optimized for TT production, vector-like bottom (B) quark decays can produce similar final state signatures, as illustrated in figure 1 (right), and are also considered. A B quark with charge \u2212e/3 is expected to decay to tW, bH, or bZ with branching fractions equal to those of the corresponding T quark decays to the same SM boson. In the interpretation of this search we assume that only one type of new particle is present, either the T or the B quark. The singlet branching fraction scenario is used as a benchmark for both T and B quarks.",

            "text": "Searches for pair-produced T and B quarks have been performed by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at \u221a s = 7 TeV [19][20][21], 8 TeV [22][23][24][25] and at 13 TeV (with 2.6 fb \u22121 and 36 fb \u22121 of data) [26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. Previous searches by CMS in single lepton final states have excluded T quark masses below 1295 GeV for B(bW) = 100% [29], and masses below 790 to 900 GeV for any possible choice of branching fractions to the three decay modes [28]. This search focuses on channels with exactly one lepton, a same-sign (SS) dilepton pair, and at least three leptons (trilepton). For background categorization, the latter two channels JHEP08 (2018)177distinguish between leptons produced directly in decays of W, H, or Z bosons (prompt) and leptons produced from other sources (nonprompt), such as heavy flavor hadron decays. This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the CMS detector and how events are reconstructed, section 3 describes the simulated background samples, and section 4 describes the physics objects. In sections 5-7 we describe strategies for the three channels of the search, and in section 8 we describe the systematic uncertainties. Lastly, in sections 9-10 we present our results and give a summary.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [33].",

Jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5-15% of the true momentum over the whole transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (\"pileup\") can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction [37] is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, and photon/Z (\u2192 e + e \u2212 /\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) + jet events. A smearing of the jet energy is applied to simulated events to mimic detector JHEP08(2018)177 resolution effects observed in data [38].

Using the Theta program [78], we calculate Bayesian credible intervals [79] to set 95% CL upper limits on the production cross section of TT at each simulated mass point, for various branching fraction scenarios. Limits are calculated in a simultaneous fit to binned marginal likelihoods from the min[M ( , b)] and S T distributions for the 16 single-lepton signal-region categories, H T distributions for the 6 single-lepton aggregate control regions, event yields for the SS dilepton channel, and S T distributions for the 4 trilepton categories. Statistical uncertainties in the background estimates are treated using the Barlow-Beeston light method [80,81]. Other systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters, as listed in table 3. Normalization uncertainties are given log-normal priors, and shape uncertainties with shifted templates are given Gaussian priors with a mean of zero and width of one. The signal cross section is assigned a flat prior distribution.",

Numbers of predicted and observed events for lepton flavor categories in the trilepton channel before the fit to data. Uncertainties include both statistical and systematic components. Figure 8 shows 95% CL upper limits on the production of T and B quarks in the benchmark branching fraction scenarios. We exclude singlet T quark masses below 1200 GeV (1160 GeV expected), doublet T quark masses below 1280 GeV (1240 GeV expected), singlet B quark masses below 1170 GeV (1130 GeV expected), and doublet B quark masses below 940 GeV (920 GeV expected). Masses below 800 GeV were excluded in previous searches. For T and B quark masses in the range 800-1800 GeV, cross sections smaller than 30.4-9.4 fb (21.2-6.1 fb) and 40.6-9.4 fb (101-49.0 fb) are excluded for the singlet (doublet) scenario. Figure 9 shows the expected and observed limits for scans over many possible T and B quark branching fraction scenarios. Based on the branching factions, lower limits on T and B quark masses range from 1140 to 1300 GeV, and from 910 to 1240 GeV.  Figure 7.

The search is performed in channels with one lepton, two same-sign leptons, or at least three leptons in the final state and makes use of techniques to identify Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying W and Higgs bosons. Combining these channels, we exclude T (B) quarks at 95% confidence level with masses below 1200 (1170) GeV in the singlet branching fraction scenario and 1280 (940) GeV in the doublet branching fraction scenario. For other branching fraction scenarios this search excludes T (B) quark masses below 1140-1300 GeV (910-1240 GeV). This represents an improvement in sensitivity of typically 200-600 GeV, compared to previous CMS results.",
