The statistical estimates include cases with background events and different data sample sizes, graphical plots to interpret results and methods to combine p-values from different experiments. These estimates are useful for optimizing the search for CP violation with different amounts of neutrino and antineutrino beam running, comparing results from different experiments and for simple cross checks of more elaborate statistical estimates that use likelihood fitting of neutrino parameters.",

This search can be performed using long baseline neutrino experiments by measuring the neutrino and antineutrino appearance oscillation probabilities, P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) and P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ), respectively.

CP conservation (CPC) predicts while travelling in vacuum that the neutrino probability and the antineutrino probability are equal. If these probabilities are not equal, then there is CP violation (CPV) in the neutrino sector. In the case of neutrinos travelling in dense matter over very long distances, these probabilities can differ due to the MSW effect [4]. The purpose of this paper is to examine various p-value hypothesis tests of CP conservation (called the null hypothesis) in long baseline neutrino test measurements",

The main statistical errors will come from the limited sample size of the appearance events. A simple test statistic [5] can be formed that is the difference of the two numbers of appearance events with an assumed known value of the CPC oscillation probabilities. Measurements of this difference can be used to calculate the p-value probability that a null hypothesis (CP conservation) could obtain at least this difference or more extreme values. In the next two sections simple examples are presented and then neutrino and antineutrino measurements are introduced. This is followed by sections describing specific neutrino cases.",

More complex methods to determine CPV include fitting the E/L distributions to determine the Pontecorvo, Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata (PMNS) neutrino parameters[1], but due to the expected small statistics from neutrino long baseline neutrino experiments in the near term, the methods presented here should be adequate to predict p-value tests of CP violation. The difference test statistic \u2206 will not be affected by uncertainties of the PMNS neutrino parameters that include the mixing angles, CP phase and the mass hierarchy, however the magnitude of the probability depends on these PMNS parameters and this can affect the resulting p-value using aSkellam distribution. The aim in this paper is to test for CPV in Eqn. 1, independent of the values of the PMNS parameters. In the following sections, different cases are presented with pedagogical examples. The material is presented in order of complexity and include cases; (I) equal data samples with no background, (II) equal data samples with background, (III) different data sample sizes, (IV) different sample sizes with backgrounds and (V), where the oscillation probabilies are assumed to be unknown. Finally a method to combine p-values from 2 different experiments is presented. Simple calculations and formulae are provided so the reader can replicate the results.",

In the limit that the Poisson distribution becomes a Normal distribution it is noted that the p-value boundaries are in units of standard deviations and the p-value will not depend on a particular value of \u03bb.Reconsider Case I, by assuming the observed events are N e = 65 and N e = 37 and using the test statistic -value boundary point is at N e / N e + N e = 6.44 and N e / N e + N e = 3.66 which has a difference of 2.772. The p-value is now estimated by assuming the unknown CP conserving probability is given by the estimate \u03bb = N e + N e /2 or 51.",
