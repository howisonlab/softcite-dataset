We analyze the kinematically underconstrained dilepton events by integrating over their neutrino rapidity distributions. We reduce the dominant systematic uncertainties from the calibration of jet energy using a correction obtained from tt events with a final state of a single lepton plus jets. We also correct jets in simulated events to replicate the quark flavor dependence of the jet response in data. We measure mt = 173.7 \u00b1 2.8 (stat) \u00b1 1.5 (syst) GeV and combining with our analysis in 1 fb \u22121 of preceding data we measure mt = 174.0\u00b12.4 (stat)\u00b1 1.4 (syst) GeV. Taking into account statistical and systematic correlations, a combination with the D0 matrix element result from both data sets yields mt = 173.9 \u00b1 1.9 (stat) \u00b1 1.6 (syst) GeV.",

The Yukawa coupling of the top quark corresponds to unity within uncertainties, and this value is constrained by a measurement of the top quark mass (m t ). In direct searches at the LHC for the SM Higgs boson, both the CMS and ATLAS experiments observe local excesses above the background expectations for a Higgs boson * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, mass (m H ) of approximately 125 GeV/c 2 [1,2], decaying to diboson final states. Combined results in searches from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron show evidence for events above background expectation in bb final states [3]. It is therefore important to sharpen the measurement of m t , as its precise value, along with the mass of the W boson (m W ), constrain the SM prediction for m H through well defined radiative corrections.",

            "text": "In pp collisions, top quarks (t) are primarily produced in tt pairs, with each top quark decaying with BR(t \u2192 W b) \u223c 100%. These events yield final states with either 0, 1, or 2 leptons from decays of the two W bosons. We consider the dilepton channels (2\u2113) that contain either electrons or muons of large transverse momentum (p T ) and at least two jets. We analyzed such events previously [4,5] using the neutrino-weighting (\u03bdWT) approach [6]. While the 2\u2113 channels have low background, the small decay branching ratio into leptons means that m t measurements from these events remained statisti-cally limited unlike in channels with one lepton and four or more jets (\u2113+jets). This situation has changed recently (e.g., Ref. [7]). Now, dominant systematic uncertainties from jet energy calibration, which have been larger [4] in the dilepton channel compared to \u2113+jets, are limiting precision of the m t measurement. In \u2113+jets events, two quarks originate from W boson decay and yield a dijet mass signature that permits a precise calibration of jet energies for the measurement of m t in tt events [8]. While this calibration has greatly improved measurements in the \u2113+jets channels, it has not been carried over to the calibration in other analyses. This is primarily due to differences in event topologies that can affect the details of the jet energy scale.",

[11] in that we do not use the \u2113+jets scale as a constraint in a combined fit of \u2113+jets and dilepton events. Instead, we use this constraint as a calibration, and estimate the uncertainties of transferring that calibration to the dilepton event topology. This procedure demonstrates how the calibration obtained using the dijet constraint from m W can be applied to different final states, and has wide applicability beyond the measurement of m t in 2\u2113 events. We also employ flavor-dependent corrections to jet energies for the first time in a dilepton analysis that substantially reduce the uncertainties on jet energy resulting from jet flavor. The presented m t measurement is performed using the same data as Ref. [7], and is correlated with it as discussed below.",

Data and simulated events are reconstructed to provide the momenta of tracks, jets, and lepton candidates. Charged leptons are required to be isolated from other calorimeter energy deposits, and to have an associated track in the inner detector. Calorimeter and tracking information are combined to identify electrons. Track parameters in the muon and inner detector system are used to identify muons. We reconstruct jets with an iterative, midpoint cone algorithm with radius R cone = 0.5 [17]. Jets are calibrated with the standard D0 jet energy correction which is derived from data [18]. The method corrects the measured jet energy to the value obtained by applying the reconstruction cone algorithm to particles from jet fragmentation before they interact with the detector. We establish the efficacy of the method in the MC, where we compare the measured jet and the jet reconstructed from fragmentation particles. The jets in data and MC are calibrated independently so that their relative response is close to unity. This corrects for detector response, energy deposited outside of the jet cone, electronics noise, and pileup. The largest correction compensates for the detector response, and is extracted using \u03b3+jet events in data and MC. We also correct jets for the p T of any embedded muon and that of the associated neutrino. We initially apply this standard calibration [18] because it provides detailed p T and \u03b7 dependent corrections. It also provides distinct corrections to jets and the imbalance in event transverse momentum ( E T ) because several components (e.g., noise and out-ofcone effects) result from the jet reconstruction algorithm rather than any undetected energy. In the p T range of jets found in tt events, the uncertainty of the standard D0 jet energy calibration averages 2%, and is dominated by systematics. Because the flavor dependence of jet energy calibration can yield one of the largest systematic uncertainties on our measurement [4], we have improved our analysis by accounting for this dependence. We use responses of single particles from data and MC to determine the energy scale for different jet flavors. We correct MC jets by the ratio of data response to MC response according to their flavor to ensure that the MC reflects the flavor dependence in data, as in Ref. [10]. We calculate E T as the negative of the vector sum of all transverse components of calorimeter cell energies and muon track momenta, corrected for the response to electrons and jets.",

The invariant mass of this jet pair can be used to improve the calibration for all jets in these events. Complications arise because the four jets in the \u2113+jets events can be incorrectly assigned to the initial four quarks. Energy from different partons is also mixed in the same jet due to a high jet multiplicity. Observed jet energies are also affected by color flow effects, which are different for the b-quark jets and for jets from the decay of color singlet W bosons. These attributes are specific to a particular event topology such as \u2113+jets. Nevertheless, a scale factor based on the dijet invariant mass that is correlated with m W can be extracted. The most recent analysis of this kind by D0 used 2.6 fb \u22121 of data and obtained a calibration factor of 1.013 \u00b1 0.008 (stat) [10]. The uncertainty of 0.8% is smaller than that of the standard jet energy correction and will decrease with additional data. There are additional systematic effects on this energy scale that one must account for when applying it to b-quark jets in the \u2113+jets analysis. These also affect our analysis, and we similarly evaluate the flavor dependence and residual energy scale systematic uncertainties directly on the measured m t to avoid double counting. These are quoted in Table II and discussed below. Beyond this, we have the possible difference between b-quark jets in dilepton events and b-quark jets in \u2113+jets events and the effect of using a calibration based on a subset of the total data, each of which we discuss now in detail.",

This has prevented significant progress in reducing the large standard jet energy scale uncertainties in dilepton analyses. To overcome this challenge and carry over the \u2113+jets calibration, we must account for the possibility that the energy scale of the b-quark jets in the two channels can differ. We calculate the energy scale, R 2\u2113 , for b-quark jets in the dilepton sample using responses for single particles that fall within the reconstructed jet cone. This is done by scaling single particle responses in MC to reproduce the energy response of jets in data [9], giving R 2\u2113 data , and using particle responses from MC, giving R 2\u2113 MC . We calculate the ratio of these two responses in the dilepton channel and the analogous ratio for b-quark jets in the \u2113+jets sample. The corresponding double ratio",

            "text": "The consequence of two neutrinos in dilepton events is an underconstrained kinematics. We employ the \u03bdWT technique to extract m t [6] due to its weak sensitivity to the modeling details of tt events. We integrate over the \u03b7 distributions predicted for both neutrinos, solve the event kinematics, and calculate E T from the neutrino momentum solutions. The expected neutrino \u03b7 distribution in the dilepton channel is symmetric around \u03b7=0 and found to be well-described by a Gaussian distribution. The width of the distribution decreases gradually with increasing m t (i.e., as the neutrinos become more central). Hence, we model the neutrino \u03b7 distributions with a Gaussian probability distribution using a width parameterized as a linear function of m t . Several more sophisticated parametrizations were tested, but provided negligible improvement in expected precision in pseudoexperiments. By comparing the calculated E T to the measured E T for each event, we calculate a weight for a given choice of m t . For each neutrino rapidity sampling, we sum the weights calculated from all combinations of neutrino momentum solutions and jet assignments. We therefore arrive at a distribution of relative weight for a range of m t for each event. We found in Ref. [4] that most of the statistical sensitivity to m t is obtained from the first two moments of this weight distribution, the mean (\u00b5 w ) and RMS (\u03c3 w ). A coarse granularity of our sampling of the \u03b7 distribution causes these moments to be unstable. To reduce this variation, we have increased the sampling for this integration by an order of magnitude relative to our previous analysis [4]. This improves the expected statistical uncertainty on m t by 4%. Requiring the integral of this distribution to be nonzero excludes events with a measured E T that is incompatible with coming from neutrinos from tt decay. This introduces a small inefficiency for the tt signal and reduces the background contamination in the final sample. Our  49,190, and 80 events in the ee, e\u00b5, and \u00b5\u00b5 channels, respectively. Probability distributions for \u00b5 w and \u03c3 w are constructed for background in each channel. Each background component is normalized to its expected event yield. We generate distributions of tt signal probability as a function of \u00b5 w , \u03c3 w , and m t . We use a binning that provides the minimum expected statistical uncertainty, as checked in pseudoexperiments. We perform a binned maximum likelihood fit to the probability distributions, fixing the total signal and background yields expected in our data. The signal is normalized to the cross section calculated for tt production [20], evaluated at m t = 172.5 GeV. For all measurements, we obtain a likelihood (L) vs. m t . We fit a parabola to the dependence of \u2212 ln L vs. m t , and the fitted mass, m fit t , is defined as the lowest point of the parabola. Point-topoint fluctuations mean that the initial placement of the window may result in an non-convergent fit. We therefore iterate the fit around the current fit minimum. This results in a significant improvement in fitting efficiency, particularly in the dimuon channel. The final \u2212 ln L vs. m t for data is shown in Fig. 1. The statistical uncertainty for each measurement is taken as the half-width of the parabola at 0.5 units in \u2212 ln L above the minimum at m fit t . The above procedure is followed for the extraction of m t from data and is used to calibrate the result as follows. We construct pseudoexperiments from signal and background MC samples according to their expected yields and allow fluctuations in each such that the total equals the number of observed events. We perform 1000 pseudoexperiments for each channel, and measure m fit t in each. A linear fit of m fit t vs. the input m t provides a calibration for our method. We also calculate the pull width of the average estimated statistical uncertainty vs the RMS of m fit t values. The resulting slopes, offsets, and pull widths are given in Table I. The m fit t and estimated statistical uncertainty are corrected with these parameters. We obtain a calibrated mass measurement for the 4.3 fb \u22121 sample in the ee, e\u00b5, and \u00b5\u00b5 channels.",

We change the \u2113+jets energy scale factor by \u00b11.1%, and perform our analysis to obtain a systematic uncertainty on m t of 0.9 GeV. The result of the \u2113+jets analysis is a single scale factor averaged over all jet p T s that are utilized in the dijet mass, i.e. dominated by light quark jets from W boson decay. As in Ref. [10], we estimate an uncertainty due to the difference in p T distributions of b-quark jets, in our case in dilepton events, vs. the calibrating jets from the W \u2192 jj sample. To estimate an uncertainty from this difference, we treat the p T and \u03b7 dependence of the uncertainty in the standard jet energy scale as a possible dependence of the residual energy scale following the calibration to \u2113+jets. We calculate the average of the energy scale uncertainty for jets in the W \u2192 jj sample. For each jet in the dilepton sample, we apply a shift corresponding to the difference between its uncertainty in energy scale and the W \u2192 jj sample's average uncertainty in energy scale. Propagating this difference through the mass analysis yields a 0.3 GeV uncertainty on m t . The flavor-dependent jet energy corrections described earlier provide MC-based mass templates that accurately reflect the data. As in [10], we propagate the uncertainty in these corrections and obtain a systematic uncertainty on m t of 0.5 GeV. The uncertainties due to flavor dependence and residual scale together with the uncertainty originating from the carry over of the jet energy scale from the \u2113+jets sample account for the difference between b-quark jets in dilepton events and jets from W \u2192 jj in \u2113+jets events.",
