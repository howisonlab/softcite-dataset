The KLOE detector consists of two main parts: a drift chamber [4] and a barrel shaped electromagnetic calorimeter [5], both inserted into a magnetic field (0.52 T). Around 60% of K L mesons reach the electromagnetic calorimeter and can be identified by their energy deposition inside it. The selection of K S \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd decays requires a vertex reconstructed near the Interaction Point with two tracks that belong to two oppositely charged particles. These particles must reach the calorimeter and deposit energy inside it in order to use Time of Flight technique. This technique aims at rejecting background, which consists mainly of K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 events, and at identifying the final charged states (\u03c0 + e \u2212\u03bd and \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd). The distribution of the difference between missing energy and momentum (\u2206E(\u03c0, e)) shows the remaining background components (see Figure 3.1). Based on an integrated luminosity of 1.7fb \u22121 around 10 5 of K S \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd decays were reconstructed and will be used to determine the charge asymmetry and branching ratio for K S semileptonic decays. A preliminary analysis shows a potential of reaching a two times better statistical error determination with a sample four times bigger than the previous KLOE analysis. The analysis is still in progress and preliminary results will be available soon. ",

The improvement on kaon vertex reconstruction and acceptance for tracks with low transverse momentum in the region near the Interaction Point crucial for K S decays, will be ensured by the newly installed Inner Tracker subdetector [7]. KLOE-2 is also equipped with low-and high-energy taggers that allow to identify e + e \u2212 originated from e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 X reactions for \u03b3\u03b3 physics [8,9]. Reconstruction of neutral particles at low polar angles will be improved due to the installation of CCALT [10] and QCALT [11] extra calorimeters. It should be emphasised that KLOE-2 aims to significantly improve the sensitivity of tests of discrete symmetries, through studies of K S charge asymmetry or quantum interferometry effects in the kaon decays, beyond the presently achieved results [6,12].",
