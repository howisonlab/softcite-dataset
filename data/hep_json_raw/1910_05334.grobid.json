The decay to two muons allows for an efficient identification of this state and its narrow peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the muons is a powerful probe of the momentum resolution of the detector. Only 6% of the J/\u03c8 states decay to a clean final state of \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with another 6% decaying to e + e \u2212 . The remaining 88% is decaying to hadronic states and are usually ignored. The other charmonium states are even harder to identify with a small fraction having a clean decay like \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 .",

For the 1P charmonium states (\u03c7 c0,1,2 ) the process with the photon is not available and we use the (gg2ccbar(3PJ)g, qg2ccbar(3PJ)q and qq2ccbar(3PJ)g processes which produce an additional gluon or quark. We have verified on the 1S samples that the distributions of the relevant charmonium variables are the same when the cc state is produced with a photon or a gluon. In Pythia 8 the minimum transverse momentum in the hard process is set to 30 GeV and the invariant mass of the hard process to within 2.5 GeV of the Z 0 mass. This produces jets with very similar momentum distributions as quark jets from Z 0 decays. Background gluon jets are taken from the charmonium samples, since they have very similar kinematics as the signal charmonium jets. Background quark jets are taken from a sample of simulated Z 0 decays. Long lived particles are allowed to decay if c\u03c4 < 100 cm. All samples are simulated without additional pile-up interactions except the sample used to estimate the effects of pile-up.",

To these variables we add the absolute values of the total charge and the jet-charge (p T weighted charge sum [10]), which are expected to peak at zero for charmonium and gluon jets, but to have a higher average value for jets originating from quarks.

To measure the performance we use independent samples with an equal amount of J/\u03c8, Z 0 \u2192 qq and gluon jets.  Figure 2 shows the output distribution for our classifier for both signal and background and the ROC curves. A good separation can be observed with an area under the curve of 0.930. This corresponds to a signal efficiency of 36(15)% at a background rejection factor of 100(1000). It should be noted that the performance of the classifier is significantly better against a background of gluon jets only (AuC = 0.966, signal efficiency of 55(23)% at 100(1000) times background rejection) than against quarks jets (AuC = 0.894, efficiency of 28(11)% at factor 100(1000) background rejection). For gluons the performance against a single background can be further improved to an AuC of 0.975 by using a gluon only background training sample.  GeV and p T > 50 GeV. We notice a maximum drop of 0.009 for the gluon sample and 0.016 for the quark sample in the AuC value, showing that the effect of jet p T is limited. We also investigate the stability of the network performance under variations of the simulation parameters. For this we applied the recommended variations [15] of the Pythia 8 parton shower and multiple parton interaction parameters based on the NNPDF23LO tune. These variations cover a range of data observables from ATLAS Run 1. Variation 1 is related to the underlying event activity, variation 2 is covering the jet shapes and substructure and the three variations 3 cover the effects of initial and final state radiation. As can be seen in table 4, the network performance is very stable for different tunes. Finally we discuss the effect of concurrent proton-proton interactions or pile-up. Our setup is not very well suited to evaluate its effects. The LHC experiments have been able to mitigate the effects of pile-up by using additional tracking and vertexing information, which is not available in DELPHES and our estimate is in this sense a worst case scenario. We simulate a sample with a pile-up of \u00b5 = 35, on average 35 concurrent interactions, the average of the recent LHC run. The retrained network, without further optimization, shows a drop of 0.05 in the AuC. This shows that pile-up has a significant impact but that our method still works in the presence of pile-up. We would expect that some of the performance loss can be recovered in a full simulation and reconstruction chain.",

            "text": "We have presented an algorithm to identify jets from hadronic decay of charmonium states and have demonstrated that it works with a good efficiency of 36% for signal at a 100 times rejection of a background of quarks and gluons. Against a background of only gluons the algorithm works even better. The method also works for J/\u03c8 and heavier charmonium states and is relatively insensitive to the simulation parameters. The algorithm works in the presence of pile-up but at a significant loss of performance. This opens the possibility to use hadronic decay modes of charmonium in the search for rare decays to cc states that suffer from low statistics.",

Gluon jets of around 40 GeV often extend beyond a \u2206R of 0.4 and not all objects are included in its energy measurement. For jets from b and c quarks the neutrinos in semileptonic decays cause a low energy tail to the jet energy spectrum. Some of the variables we use, like the width, correlate with the jet energy. We verify that the network performance does not depend strongly on jet energy by splitting the test sample in three bins: p T < 35 GeV; 35 < p T < 50 Funding information SC would like to acknowledge support from the Duke REU Program through NSF Grant No. NSF-PHY-1757783.",
