            "text": "The production of jets with large transverse momenta p T \u226b \u039b QCD \u2248 0.2 GeV in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions originates from the scattering of partons, a process described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), through the convolution of the parton-parton cross section with the density of partons inside the protons. Jet production in pp collisions at the LHC, at transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV and in the pseudorapidity range j\u03b7j < 3, is well described by next-to-leading-order pQCD calculations [1][2][3]. However, most of the final-state hadrons produced in pp collisions arise from the hadronization of quarks and gluons scattered through \"semihard\" interactions with exchanged momenta of O\u00f01-3 GeV\u00de. At such low values of p T , the theoretical partonic cross section, d\u03c3=dp 2 T \u221d \u03b1 2 S \u00f0p T \u00de=p 4 T , where \u03b1 S is the strong coupling, becomes very large, and the integrated cross section \u03c3\u00f0p min T \u00de \u00bc R p min T dp 2 T d\u03c3=dp 2 T exceeds the total inelastic pp cross section, \u03c3 inel . At ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, where \u03c3 inel \u2248 70 mb [4], this occurs at p min T values of O\u00f03 GeV\u00de, much larger than the QCD scale, \u039b QCD , at which the strong coupling diverges [5,6].",

The advantage of jets is that they include more particles originating from the outgoing partons, while single charged hadrons carry only a fraction of the parent parton momentum. On the other hand, jets are sensitive to the underlying event (UE) activity, consisting of particles originating from multiple partonic interactions (MPIs) and initial-and final-state radiation, while single leading tracks are not. The measurements based on leading particles and leading jets are therefore complementary. Throughout the text, the term \"track jets\" refers to detectorlevel jets, reconstructed from charged-particle tracks observed in the detector, while \"charged-particle jets\" or just \"jets\" denotes corrected, stable-particle level jets, consisting of stable charged particles from the final state.",

Perturbative parton-parton processes are obtained via \"cut (hard) pomeron\" diagrams, and multiscattering phenomena (saturation, MPI) are implemented through various procedures [24]. The two models differ in their approximations for the collision configurations (with exact energy sharing imposed in the case of EPOS) and the treatment of diffractive and perturbative contributions (the effective soft-hard transition occurs at p T;0 \u223c 1.6 GeV for QGSJET-II and at p T;0 \u223c 2 GeV for EPOS). Finally, in contrast to other MCs, EPOS includes also collective expansion effects in the final state that boost the final p T distribution of the produced hadrons. It is worth highlighting that, for all MC models, the (center-of-mass energy dependent) p T;0 cutoff plays a very similar role to the \"saturation scale\" (Q sat ), which controls the onset of gluon fusion effects in the parton densities [25].",

Pileup events are rejected by requiring exactly one vertex, following the method described in Ref. [28]. Minimum bias events were selected online with the TOTEM T2 telescopes [29] that are placed symmetrically at about 14 m on both sides from the interaction point (IP). Single tracks are reconstructed in these telescopes with almost 100% efficiency for p T > 20 MeV=c, but because of multiple scattering and the effect of the magnetic field, tracks can be identified as coming from the IP with an efficiency that increases as a function of p T and is greater than 80% for p T > 40 MeV=c [30]. The minimum bias trigger, defined by the requirement of the presence of at least one track candidate in either of the T2 detectors [31], has an efficiency close to 100% [28] for events where a charged particle is produced within the T2 acceptance.

Its effect is studied by randomly rejecting 3.9% of the tracks and then repeating the analysis. In the jet analysis, for tracks with low p T , the rejection probability is taken as 15% for p T < 1 GeV. However, since the measurement is integrated over p T , it is nearly insensitive to even such large values of the rejection probability. The resulting uncertainty varies between 0.4% and 3.7% for the leading charged-particle analysis and between 2% and 12% for the leading jet analysis. The larger uncertainties correspond to higher p min T . The p T distribution of leading track jets is unfolded to the stable-particle level by applying the iterative procedure [38] implemented in ROOUNFOLD [39] in order to correct for the jet reconstruction efficiency and for migrations in jet p T . Thanks to the good p T resolution of the reconstructed tracks, a simple correction for the track-finding efficiency is found to be sufficient for obtaining the p T distribution of leading charged particles. The PYTHIA 6 and PYTHIA 8 MC models are used to generate the response matrices and efficiency corrections, and the average correction from the two generators is used to obtain the p T distributions at the stable-particle level. The corrections vary between 5% and 10% at p T \u2248 1 GeV, to 10% and 40% at p T \u2248 45 GeV, for the charged particle and the jet measurements, respectively. The deviation from the average is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty related to the correction procedure. This uncertainty varies from 0.6% to 3% for the leading charged-particle analysis, and from 2% to 10% for the leading jet analysis, depending on p min T .

The turnover from a relatively flat to a steeply falling distribution takes place between 1 and 10 GeV.

The exact choice of the normalization point is arbitrary-r\u00f0p lead T > 9.0 GeV\u00de for the leading charged particle and r\u00f0p lead T > 14.3 GeV\u00de for the leading jet-and the conclusions from this study are drawn from the shape of the distributions alone. The predictions at small p lead T thus give information on the modelling of the transition region from large to small p lead T . In Fig. 1 (left plots), the yields r\u00f0p min T \u00de as a function of p min T are compared to the predictions of the event generator PYTHIA 6 with tunes Z2\u00c3 and CUET, as well as with the default version of PYTHIA 6, both with and without MPI. Also shown is the impact of turning off the regularization of the cross section, labeled \"PYTHIA 6 (default, MPI off, no sat).\" At low p min T , the distribution predicted by this latter model differs by more than 1 order of magnitude from predictions with the regularized cross section.",

            "text": "The integrated yields of events with a leading charged particle or a leading charged-particle jet with p T above a given p min T threshold, starting at p min T \u00bc 0.8 and 1 GeV, respectively, have been measured in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 45 \u03bcb \u22121 . The particles and jets are measured in the pseudorapidity ranges j\u03b7j < 2.4 and 1.9, respectively. The yields are found to be relatively flat in the p min T region around 1 GeV-where the fixed-order perturbative parton-parton cross section diverges in the absence of any mechanism that saturates or unitarizes the pQCD scattering-followed by a steep decrease for p min T > 10 GeV. The flattening behavior observed at very low p min T is best described by EPOS, which deviates by at most 10% from the data. The comparison of the data with different phenomenological predictions of hadronic interaction models may help to improve the description of the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative QCD regimes, which is dominated by the effects of parton density saturation and multiple partonic interactions.",
