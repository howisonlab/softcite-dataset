GeV, a clear \u03c9\u03c7c1 signal is seen, and the cross section is measured to be (9.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 1.3) pb, while evidence is found for an \u03c9\u03c7c2 signal. The first errors are statistical and the second are systematic. Due to low luminosity or low cross section at other energies, no significant signals are observed. In the \u03c9\u03c7c2 cross section, an enhancement is seen around \u221a s = 4.42 GeV. Fitting the cross section with a coherent sum of the \u03c8(4415) Breit-Wigner function and a phase space term, the branching fraction B(\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7c2) is obtained to be of the order of 10 \u22123 . In recent years, charmonium physics gained renewed strong interest from both the theoretical and the experimental side, due to the observation of charmoniumlike states, such as X(3872) [1,2], Y (4260) [3][4][5], Y (4360) [6,7] and Y (4660) [7]. These states do not fit in the conventional charmonium spectroscopy, and could be exotic states that lie outside the quark model [8]. Moreover, charged charmonium-like states Z c (3900) [9][10][11][12], Z c (3885) [13,14], Z c (4020) [15,16] and Z c (4025) [17,18] or their neutral partners were observed, which might indicate the presence of new dynamics in this energy region. Searches for new decay modes and measurements of their line shapes may help us gain a better understanding of the nature of charmonium(-like) states.",

As the line shape is incompatible with that of Y (4260) in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, the authors of Ref. [21] suggest the excess of \u03c9\u03c7 c0 events due to a missing charmonium state, while Ref. [22] attributes it to the tail of the \u03c8(4160). A similar pattern could be expected for the other spin triplet P -wave states \u03c7 c1,2 . It is therefore very interesting to search for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0,1,2 in the BESIII data collected at \u221a s > 4.4 GeV. The \u03c9transition may help us to establish connections between these charmonium(-like) states.",

Due to the limited integrated luminosity, the \u03c9\u03c7 c1,2 signals at the other energy points ( \u221a s = 4.467, 4.527 and 4.574 GeV) are not significant, and upper limits at the 90% C.L. are derived. The signal yields are obtained by counting events in the \u03c7 c1,2 signal regions and subtracting the backgrounds which are estimated from the \u03c7 c1,2 sidebands. The peaking backgrounds here are negligible. For the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 decay mode, signals are not significant at any of the energy points. We construct a likelihood function by assuming that the observed events follow a Poisson distribution and the background events follow a Gaussian distribution, where the signal yields are limited to be positive. From the likelihood distribution, the signal yields and uncertainties are determined.",

Near \u221a s = 4.6 GeV a clear \u03c9\u03c7 c1 signal is observed in 567 pb \u22121 of data, with a cross section of (9.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 1.3) pb; evidence for an \u03c9\u03c7 c2 signal is found. The \u03c9\u03c7 c1,2 signals at other energies and the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 signals are not significant, the upper limits on the Born cross section at 90% C.L. are calculated. Interesting line shapes are observed for \u03c9\u03c7 cJ . There is an enhancement for \u03c9\u03c7 c2 around 4.42 GeV, which doesn't appear in the \u03c9\u03c7 c0,1 channels. A coherent sum of the \u03c8(4415) BW function and a phase-space term can well describe the \u03c9\u03c7 c2 line shape, and the branching fraction B(\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c2 ) is found to be in the order of 10 \u22123 . The cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c1 seems to be rising near 4.6 GeV. The \u03c9\u03c7 c0 is refitted with the higher energy points included, and the fit results remain almost unchanged. The different line shapes observed for \u03c9\u03c7 cJ might indicate that the production mechanism is different, and that nearby resonances (e.g. \u03c8(4415)) have different branching fractions to the \u03c9\u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) decay modes. Further studies based on more data samples at higher energy will be helpful to clarify the nature of charmonium(-like) states in this region.",
