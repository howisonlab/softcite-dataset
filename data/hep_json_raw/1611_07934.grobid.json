Using a full data sample collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e + e \u2212 collider, we report searches for a light non-Standard Model Higgs boson, dark photon, and a new muonic dark force mediated by a gauge boson (Z ) coupling only to the second and third lepton families. Our results significantly improve upon the current bounds and further constrain the remaining region of the allowed parameter space.",

            "text": "Many astrophysical and cosmological observations indicate that a fraction of energy density in the universe is due to non-baryonic matter. The microscopic nature of dark matter is currently unknown. Models of physics beyond Standard Model predict the existence of a new non-Abelian gauge group Higgs with gauge boson masses below 10 GeV [1]. The WIMP hypothesis suggested that dark matter is assumed to consist of stable particle with low masses. Such new gauge bosons can typically interact with other Standard Model elementary particles. The new gauge boson, Z , can couple to the Standard Model field. SM fields can be directly charged under new gauge boson or the Z may couple with the SM hypercharge boson [2].",

The gauge L \u03bc \u2212 L \u03c4 model portal to the Z has all features of being coupled only to the leptons of the second and third generation. The L \u03bc \u2212 L \u03c4 model has been studied in the neutrino mass model. It has also been studied in the (g-2) current discrepancy. Consequently it was found that the tentative explanation of the (g-2) anomaly in models with large electron coupling is now excluded at least for multi-GeV and heavier Z bosons. The model explains the possible production of Z gauge boson production via e + e \u2212 \u2192\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 Z , Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 that primarily comes from the radiation of heavy-flavor leptons and is shown in the following Fig. 1  ",

At the low mass of the four-muon invariant mass, m(4\u03bc) < 9 GeV, is well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation including direct decays of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , however, the Monte Carlo simulation overestimates the full energy peak by \u223c 30% and fails to reproduce the radiactive tail.

To estimate the potential ISR emission we select e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events by requiring a four-muon invariant mass distribution within 500 MeV of the nominal center-of-mass energy.

The reduced dimuon mass is calculated using the following equation m R = m 2 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u2212 4m 2 \u03bc in linear scale as shown in Fig. 3 and in log scale as shown in Fig. 4. The most dominant samples is coming from the direct decay of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 process. The contribution from the decay of \u03a5(2S ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 as shown around 3 GeV. The reduced dimoun mass distribution has a better behavior near threshold and it is also easier to model compare to the dimuon mass distribution. The signal efficiency at low masses is about 35% and it rises to about 50% around higher mass of the reduced dimuon mass. We exclude the J/\u03c8 region when calculating the correction factors by fitting the simulated and reconstructed reduced dimuon  masses in the range of 1 < m R < 9 GeV. We obtain a correction factor of 0.82 as shown in Fig. 3. It includes the ISR emission and differences in the trigger efficiency, charged particle identification, and track and photon reconstruction efficiencies. We assign a systematic uncertainty of 5% to cover the small variations between the uncertainties on the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and data taking period. We calculate the ISR contribution based on the quasi real electron approximation [15]. We assess the sidebands of the four dimuon mass distribution in the range of 5.0 -8.0 GeV. In this region the process of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b3) is dominant. The correction factors are in agreement with the correction factors obtain from the reduce dimuon mass spectrum. The signal yield is extracted bu a series of unbinned likelihood fits to the reduced dimuon mass spectrum within the range of 0.212 < m R < 10 GeV and 0.212 < m R < 9 GeV for the \u03a5(4S ) resonance data and \u03a5(2S ) and \u03a5(3S ) resonances data, respectively. We exclude a region of \u00b130 MeV around the nominal known J/\u03c8 mass. We probe a total of 2219 mass hypothesis. The cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 Z , Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 is extracted as a function of Z mass as shown in Fig. 5. The gray band indicates the excluded region. We find the largest local significance is 4.3\u03c3 around Z mass of 8.2 GeV that is corresponding to the global significance of 1.6\u03c3 and it is consistent with the zero-hypothesis. We also derive 90% confidence level (CL) Bayesian upper limit on the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 Z , Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 as shown in Fig. 6.",

No significant signal is observed for Z masses in the range of 0.212 -10 GeV. We set limits on the coupling parameters g down to 7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . We set a strongest bounds for many parameter space below 3 GeV. We exclude most of the remaining parameter space preferred by the discrepancy between the calculated and measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon above the dimuon threshold [16].  ",
