The anisotropic transverse flow is one of the key observables to study the properties of dense matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The MPD performance for anisotropic flow measurements is studied with Monte-Carlo simulations of gold ions at NICA energies \u221a s NN = 4 \u2212 11 GeV using different heavy-ion event generators. Different combinations of the MPD detector subsystems are used to investigate the possible systematic biases in flow measurements, and to study effects of detector azimuthal non-uniformity. The resulting performance of the MPD for flow measurements is demonstrated for directed and elliptic flow of identified charged hadrons as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum in different centrality classes.",

Transverse anisotropic flow measurements are one of the key methods to study the time evolution of the strongly interacting medium formed in nuclear collisions. In non-central collisions, the initial spatial anisotropy results in an azimuthally anisotropic emission of particles. The magnitude of the anisotropic flow can be defined via the Fourier coefficients v n {\u03a8 m } of azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles with respect to the reaction plane [2]:",

The difference between LAQGSM and UrQMD is due to the fact, that the first model simulates nuclear fragments, while in the second one the spectators consist of neutrons and protons only. Hence, in the case of LAQGSM, more particles go through the beam hole in the center of FHCal detectors. Apart from that, the results show good performance in a wide centrality range from 0 to 80% for all energies. In Fig. 2 the resolution correction factor for both flow harmonics using LAQGSM is presented.
