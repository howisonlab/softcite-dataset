The search is based upon proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and up to 19.7fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Several final states of the H \u2192 WW and H \u2192 ZZ decays are analyzed. The combined upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction exclude a Higgs boson with standard model-like couplings and decays in the range 145 < m H < 1000 GeV. We also interpret the results in the context of an electroweak singlet extension of the standard model.",

The mass of the boson is not predicted by the theory. In 2012 the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC reported the observation of a new boson with a mass of about 125 GeV [10][11][12][13][14]. Throughout this paper, we denote the observed Higgs boson as h(125). Subsequent studies of the production and decay rates [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] and of the spin-parity quantum numbers [18,19,26,27] of the new boson show that its properties are compatible with those expected for the SM Higgs boson.",

Based on a dataset of 4.7 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and up to 5.9 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, and combining all channels listed in ref. [10], ATLAS excludes a SM-like heavy Higgs boson of 131 < m H < 559 GeV at 95% CL [10]. The CMS collaboration reported a search in the WW and ZZ decay channels using an initial dataset of 5.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 5.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, searching in the mass range 145 < m H < 1000 GeV, and excluding Higgs boson masses up to 710 GeV at 95% CL [64]. In this paper, we report on an extension of this search using the complete 7 and 8 TeV dataset. In addition, the search is interpreted in the context of the SM expanded by an additional EW singlet. Both the SM-like heavy Higgs boson as well as the EW singlet are denoted as H here.",

Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and the muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the detector as well as the definition of the coordinate system and relevant kinematic variables can be found in ref. [65].",

The qq \u2192 ZZ production process is simulated at NLO with powheg, and the gg \u2192 ZZ process is simulated at LO using gg2zz 3.1 [79]. Other diboson processes (WZ, Z\u03b3 ( * ) , W\u03b3 ( * ) ), Z+jets, and W+jets are generated with pythia and MadGraph. The tt and tW events are generated at NLO with powheg. For all samples, pythia is used for parton showering, hadronization, and underlying event simulation. For LO generators, the default set of parton distribution functions (PDF) used to produce these samples is CTEQ6L [80], while CT10 [81] is used for NLO generators. The tau lepton decays are simulated with tauola [82]. The detector response is simulated using a detailed description of the CMS detector, based on the Geant4 package [83], with event reconstruction performed identically to that of recorded data. The simulated samples include the effect of multiple pp interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The pythia parameters for the underlying events and pileup interactions are set to the Z2 (Z2 * ) tune [84] for the 7 (8) TeV simulated data sample, with the pileup multiplicity distribution matching the one observed in data. The data are analysed to search for both a beyond the standard model (BSM) case in the form of an EW singlet scalar mixed with the recently discovered Higgs boson, h(125), as well as a heavy Higgs boson with SM-like couplings. The couplings of the two gauge eigenstates (h(125) and EW singlet) are phenomenologically constrained by unitarity and the coupling strength of the light Higgs boson is therefore reduced with respect to the SM case. The unitarity constraint is ensured by enforcing C 2 + C 2 = 1, where C and C are defined as the scale factors of the couplings with respect to the SM of the low-and highmass Higgs boson, respectively. The EW singlet production cross section is also modified by a factor \u00b5 and the modified width is \u0393 ; they are defined as",

For the ggF production mode, the weights are calculated using either the gg2zz generator for the ZZ channel, or the powheg and mcfm 6.2 [86] generators for the interference calculation for the WW channel. For the VBF production mode, the interference weights are computed using the Phantom 1.2 [87] generator, where the signal-only lineshape at LO is weighted based on results obtained with MadGraph generator predictions. The weights are defined as the ratio of the sum of a narrow resonance signal plus interference and the standard model signal lineshape as generated. The contribution from the interference term between the BSM Higgs boson and the background is furthermore assumed to scale according to the modified coupling of the Higgs boson as (\u00b5 + I) BSM = \u00b5 SM C 2 + I SM C , where \u00b5(I) is the signal strength (interference) in the BSM or SM cases. This assumption is based on the hypothesis that the couplings are similar to the SM case and simply rescale due to unitarity constraints. Systematic uncertainties considered for this procedure are detailed later.",

Additional requirements are applied to reject electrons originating from photon conversions in the tracker material. Electron identification relies on a multivariate discriminant that combines observables sensitive to the bremsstrahlung along the electron trajectory, the geometrical and momentum-energy matching between the electron trajectory and the associated supercluster, as well as ECAL shower shape observables. Electron candidates with a pseudorapidity \u03b7 of their ECAL supercluster in the transition region between ECAL barrel and endcap (1.4442 < |\u03b7| < 1.5660) are rejected, because the reconstruction of electrons in this region is compromised [94].",

We require that the isolation sum is smaller than 20% (15%) of the muon (electron) transverse momentum. To account for the contribution to the isolation sum from pileup interactions and the underlying event, a median energy density is determined on an event-by-event basis using the method described in ref. [96]. For electron candidates, an effective area that is proportional to the isolation cone, is derived to renormalize this density estimate to the number of pileup interactions, and is subtracted from the isolation sum. For muon and tau candidates, the correction is done by subtracting half the sum of the transverse momenta of the charged particles not associated to the primary vertex in the cone of interest. Soft muons do not need to fulfill isolation requirements.",

Any reconstructed jet overlapping with isolated leptons within a distance of 0.5 (0.8) for AK5 (CA8) jets is removed in order to avoid double counting the lepton as a jet. AK5 (CA8) jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 4.7 (2.4). At hadron level, the jet momentum is defined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found in the simulation to be within 5-10% of the true momentum over the whole p T range and detector acceptance. A correction is applied to the jet p T to take into account the extra energy clustered in jets due to additional proton-proton interactions within the same bunch crossing [96,101]. Other jet energy scale (JES) corrections applied are derived from the simulation, and are calibrated with in situ measurements of the energy balance of dijet and Z/\u03b3+jets events. For some of the channels in this analysis, a combinatorial background arises from low-p T jets from pileup interactions, which get clustered into high-p T jets. At \u221a s = 8 TeV the number of pileup events is larger than at \u221a s = 7 TeV, and a multivariate selection is applied to separate jets stemming from the primary interaction and those reconstructed due to energy deposits associated with pileup interactions [102]. The discrimination is based on the differences in the jet shapes, on the relative multiplicity of charged and neutral components, and on the different fraction of transverse momentum, which is carried by the hardest components. Within the tracker acceptance, the tracks belonging to each jet are also required to be compatible with the primary vertex.",

Events with E miss T, pr > 20 GeV are selected for this analysis. The backgrounds are suppressed using techniques described in refs. [11,12].

According to simulation over 85% of signal events are assigned the correct p z value, thus improving the mass resolution, especially at low Higgs mass. The contribution of each background in the signal region (66 < m jj < 98 GeV) is described by an expected shape and normalization. The distribution of the W+jets contribution is parameterized with a polynomial functional form determined through simulation. The parameters of the function are determined from the observed data spectrum in the binned likelihood fit, which is also used to determine the exclusion limits. The other background shape distributions are parameterized using simulation, and their normalizations and uncertainties are included as nuisance parameters. Figure 2 depicts the m WW distribution for the muon category for two different Higgs boson mass hypotheses. The observed data are compared to background and signal expectations.  Experimental effects, theoretical predictions, and uncertainties due to the choice of fit functions are considered as sources of systematic uncertainty. Because of the large background, the dominant source of systematic uncertainty is the shape uncertainty of the W+jets m WW distribution, followed by the normalization uncertainty that is extracted from the m jj fit.

In the 0-or 1-jet category the p T spectrum of the four-lepton system is exploited to distinguish between ggF and vector boson induced production modes, such as VBF and associated production with a vector boson (VH). The events selected with two or more jets potentially come from several sources: background (predominantly ZZ+2 jets), VBF signal, VH signal (with V\u21922 jets), and ggF signal gg \u2192 H+2 jets. In order to isolate the production mechanism, we use a matrix-element-based probability [71,117] for the kinematics of the two jets and the Higgs boson to come either from the VBF process or from the gg \u2192 H+2 jets process. This discriminant is equally efficient to separate VBF from either H+2 jets signal or ZZ+2 jets background, because both processes show very similar jet kinematics.",

Upper limits on the model parameters are set for different m H hypotheses using a modified frequentist method referred to as the CL s method [122,123], where a likelihood ratio test statistic is  used in which the nuisance parameters are profiled. In the likelihood ratio, the total number of observed events is compared to the signal and background predictions by means of a product of Poisson probabilities. The predictions are subject to the multiple uncertainties described in the previous section, and are handled by introducing nuisance parameters with probability density functions. The nuisance parameters modify parametrically the expectations for both signal and background processes. Furthermore, a signal strength modifier (\u00b5) is used to scale the Higgs boson cross sections of all production mechanisms by the same factor with respect to their SM predictions while keeping the decay branching fractions unchanged.",
