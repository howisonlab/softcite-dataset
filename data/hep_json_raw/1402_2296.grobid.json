The reaction \u03b3 \u00fe p \u2192 K \u00fe \u00fe \u039b\u00f01405\u00de is analyzed in the decay channel \u039b\u00f01405\u00de \u2192 \u03a3 \u00fe \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 , where the decay distribution to \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 and the variation of the \u03a3 \u00fe polarization with respect to the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de polarization direction determines the parity. The \u039b\u00f01405\u00de is produced, in the energy range 2.55 < W < 2.85 GeV and for 0.6 < cos \u03b8 c:m: K \u00fe < 0.9, with polarization P \u00bc 0.45 AE 0.02\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.07\u00f0syst\u00de. The analysis shows that the decays are in S wave, with the \u03a3 \u00fe polarized such that the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de has spin-parity J The \u039b\u00f01405\u00de has long been a peculiar state in the spectrum of excited hyperons. Lying just below the NK threshold, there is no universal agreement on the nature of this state. The constituent quark model for P-wave baryons [1], which has had success in describing the nonstrange low-mass baryons, has difficulty in computing the correct mass. More recently, the chiral unitary approach [2] describes the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de as a dynamically generated state of two overlapping isospin-zero poles in the rescattering of the octet meson and baryon states that couple to it. Another theory describes the state as a quasibound state of NK embedded in a \u03a3\u03c0 continuum [3].",

Previous experiments [4,5,8] showed that the spin was consistent with 1 2 , but insufficient statistics and lack of polarization of the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de made the parity determination impossible. Recently, the results of a photoproduction experiment by the CLAS Collaboration at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) were presented [9,10]. The exclusive reaction \u03b3 \u00fe p \u2192 K \u00fe \u00fe \u039b\u00f01405\u00de was produced using an unpolarized beam and target and analyzed for the three \u03a3\u03c0 decay channels.

The nine bins of energy and angle we select have c.m. energy W centered at 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 GeV, and for each energy bin, the three forwardmost kaon angle bins were used. The detected particles were K \u00fe , p, and \u03c0 \u2212 , with a kinematic fit applied to select events with a missing \u03c0 0 . Figure 2(a) shows the \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass M\u00f0\u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de for these nine bins combined, where the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de and \u039b\u00f01520\u00de are seen, along with background contributions from K \u00fe \u03a3 0 \u00f01385\u00de and K \u00c30 \u03a3 \u00fe production. In the present analysis, the backgrounds could not be removed event by event. Events were selected based on the \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass range of 1.30-1.45 GeV=c 2 , where the spectrum is dominated by the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de. Backgrounds due to non-\u039b\u00f01405\u00de production were estimated in previous works, where beside the channels listed above, a Y \u00c3 \u00f01670\u00de background was used to parametrize the higher-mass data. We estimate these backgrounds as approximately 16% total, mostly from the \u03a3 0 \u00f01385\u00de. Figure 2(b) shows a Dalitz-like plot of the \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass M\u00f0\u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de versus the mass M\u00f0K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de, where a slight overlap of the K \u00c30 \u03a3 \u00fe events (vertical band) with the \u039b\u00f01405\u00de and \u039b\u00f01520\u00de events (horizontal bands) is seen. Due to the kinematics of the reaction, the overlap is not significant and has little influence in these kinematic bins.  For each of the nine bins of W and kaon angle, each spinparity hypothesis was tested with maximum likelihood fits to the data using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the data that was matched to have the same \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution as the data but generated without any angular correlations. The fit functions used joint probability distributions of the \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 angular decay distribution and the p\u03c0 0 weak decay distribution. The \u03a3 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 distribution was isotropic for spin 1 2 and as given in Eq. (1) for spin 3 2 . The p\u03c0 0 weak decay distribution used I\u00f0\u03b8 p \u00de \u221d 1 \u00fe \u03b1 0 Q z cos \u03b8 p , with the Q z as a fit parameter, and \u03b8 p is the proton decay angle in the \u03a3 \u00fe rest frame. Figure 3 shows sample distributions of data and MC events for cos \u03b8 \u03a3 \u00fe (our specific cos \u03b8 Y ) and cos \u03b8 p . The nonflatness of the cos \u03b8 \u03a3 \u00fe distribution reflects the CLAS acceptance, which varies significantly depending not only on cos \u03b8 \u03a3 \u00fe and cos \u03b8 p but also the azimuthal angles for each distribution. We see from Fig. 3 that the unweighted MC that was generated with isotropic distributions is able to reproduce the data well for the cos \u03b8 \u03a3 \u00fe distribution, lending support to the spin 1 2 hypothesis. However, the cos \u03b8 p distribution requires a reweighting of MC events with a polarization to match the data, and it is this polarization of the data that allows a strong discrimination among the different hypotheses.",
