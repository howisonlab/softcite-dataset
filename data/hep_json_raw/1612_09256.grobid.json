            "text": "A measurement of electroweak-induced production of W\u03b3 and two jets is performed, where the W boson decays leptonically. The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment in \u221a s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions produced at the LHC. Candidate events are selected with exactly one muon or electron, missing transverse momentum, one photon, and two jets with large rapidity separation. An excess over the hypothesis of the standard model without electroweak production of W\u03b3 with two jets is observed with a significance of 2.7 standard deviations. The cross section measured in the fiducial region is 10.8 \u00b1 4.1(stat) \u00b1 3.4(syst) \u00b1 0.3(lumi) fb, which is consistent with the standard model electroweak prediction. The total cross section for W\u03b3 in association with two jets in the same fiducial region is measured to be 23.2 \u00b1 4.3(stat) \u00b1 1.7(syst) \u00b1 0.6(lumi) fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction from the combination of electroweakand quantum chromodynamics-induced processes. No deviations are observed from the standard model predictions and experimental limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings f M,0\u22127 /\u039b 4 , f T,0\u22122 /\u039b 4 , and f T,5\u22127 /\u039b 4 are set at 95% confidence level.",

Additionally, the non-Abelian nature of gauge interactions was tested by the measurements of diboson production (e.g., refs. [5-13]). The CERN LHC allows the measurement of many novel processes predicted by the SM, especially those that involve pure electroweak (EW) interactions with relatively small cross sections compared with QCD-induced production of EW final states. Typical examples include triple gauge boson production [14] and vector boson scattering (VBS) or vector boson fusion (VBF) processes [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22].",

This process is expected to have one of the largest cross sections of all the VBS processes and thus is expected to be one of the first VBS processes observable at a hadron collider. As shown in figure 1, W\u03b3 production includes several different classes of diagrams: bremsstrahlung of one or two vector bosons and the more interesting VBS EW processes such as in figure 1c. The cross sections of EW-induced only and EW+QCD total W\u03b3 processes are measured in a VBS-like fiducial region, where the two jets have a large separation in pseudorapidity. The signal structure of the weak boson scattering events makes VBS processes a good probe of quartic gauge boson couplings. Instead of measuring the SM gauge couplings, which are completely fixed by the SM SU(2) L \u2297 U(1) Y gauge symmetry, we keep the SM gauge symmetry while setting limits on a set of higher dimensional anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs).

Because these processes can have the same set of initial and final states, these three contributions interfere. One can suppress this interference by choosing an appropriate phase space for the measurements. The WV\u03b3 events reside mainly in the W or Z boson mass window; we require m jj > 200 GeV to eliminate most of this contribution. The EW W\u03b3+2 jets events favor a larger m jj region than the QCD W\u03b3+2 jets events do. Calculations using the MadGraph program show the interference decreases with increasing m jj and |\u2206\u03b7(j1, j2)|, and can change from constructive to destructive at \u223c1 TeV in m jj depending on the choice of renormalization and factorization scales. In the analysis we consider the phase space region with m jj > 700 GeV and |\u2206\u03b7(j1, j2)| > 2.4 to suppress the interference. The interference effect in the fiducial region is estimated to be 4.6% of the total W\u03b3+2 jets cross section.",

The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of 75 848 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage in |\u03b7| < 1.48 in the barrel region (EB) and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.00 in the two endcap regions (EE). A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with three radiation lengths of lead is located in front of the EE. Photons are identified as ECAL energy clusters not linked to the extrapolation of any charged particle trajectory to the ECAL. These energy clusters are merged to form superclusters that are five crystals wide in \u03b7, centered around the most energetic crystal, and have a variable width in the azimuthal angle \u03c6. The HCAL consists of a set of sampling calorimeters that utilize alternating layers of brass as absorber and plastic scintillator as active material. It provides coverage for |\u03b7| < 3.0. Combined with the forward calorimeter modules, the coverage of hadronic jets is extended to |\u03b7| < 5.0. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum and the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energies, corrected for the combined response function of the calorimeters. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. The muon system includes barrel drift tubes covering JHEP06(2017)106 the range |\u03b7| < 1.2, endcap cathode strip chambers (0.9 < |\u03b7| < 2.5), and resistive-plate chambers (|\u03b7| < 1.6) [33]. The CMS detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for measurements of the missing transverse momentum vector p miss T , which is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event.",

Jets are required to satisfy a set of loose ID criteria designed to eliminate jets originating from noisy channels in the calorimeter [60]. Pileup collisions and the underlying event can contribute to the energy of the reconstructed jets. A correction based on the projected area of a jet on the front face of the calorimeter is used to subtract the extra energy deposited in the jet coming from pileup [61,62]. Furthermore, the energy response in \u03b7 and p T is corrected, and the energy resolution is smeared for simulated samples to give the same response as observed [63].

The estimation is based on events similar to the ones selected with the baseline selection described in section 4, except that the photon must fail the tight photon ID and satisfy a looser ID requirement. This selection ensures that the photon arises from a jet, but still has kinematic properties similar to a genuine photon originating from the primary vertex. The selected events are then normalized to the number of events satisfying the tight photon ID and weighted with the probability of a jet to be misidentified as a photon. The misidentification probability is calculated as a function of photon p T in a manner similar to that described in ref. [66]. The method uses the shapes of the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 and PF charged isolation distributions, which differ for genuine and misidentified photons. The fraction of the total background in the signal region contributed by this source decreases with p \u03b3 T , from a maximum of 33% (p T \u2248 22 GeV) to 6% (p T > 135 GeV). The \u03b3+jets events contribute to the background when the jet is misidentified as a muon or electron. The contribution is found to be negligible in the muon channel, but can be significant in the electron channel, especially in the low-m jj region. A control data sample is selected, in a similar way to that discussed in the previous paragraph, from the PF relative isolation sideband with a very loose electron ID requirement. Events in this control sample are then normalized to the events with signal selection and weighted with the misidentification probability for a jet to satisfy the electron selections. This probability is determined from a three-component fit to the | p miss T | distribution considering the \u03b3+jets JHEP06 (2017)106misidentified events, QCD W\u03b3+jets events, and misidentified photon events, as explained in more detail in ref. [64]. The \u03b3+jets background contribution in electron channel is estimated to be 7% of the total yield for the baseline selections and negligible in the EW signal region.",

In addition, when extrapolating from the control region to the signal region, the shape dependence on theoretical parameters affects the normalization of the QCD W\u03b3+jets distribution at high m jj . This extrapolation uncertainty is calculated by using different MC samples with matching and renormalization/factorization scales varied up and down by a factor of two.

There are three contributions to the uncertainties in the misidentified photon background: the statistical uncertainty, the variation in the choice of the charged isolation sideband, and the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 shape in the sample of events with objects misidentified as photons. The combined uncertainty, calculated in p \u03b3 T bins, increases from 13% at p \u03b3 T \u2248 25 GeV to 54% for p \u03b3 T \u2248 135 GeV. The uncertainty in the measured value of the integrated luminosity is 2.6% [35]. Jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties contribute via selection thresholds for the jet p T and m jj . We consider the uncertainties in different intervals of m jj , giving a combined uncertainty varying from 12 to 31% with increasing m jj in the signal region. A small difference in | p miss T | resolution [67] between data and simulation affects the signal selection efficiency by less than 1%. The uncertainties due to the lepton trigger efficiency and JHEP06 2017  reconstruction and the selection efficiencies are estimated to be 1% and 2%, respectively. Photon reconstruction efficiency and energy scale uncertainties contribute to the signal selection efficiency at the 1% level. The uncertainty from the b jet veto procedure is 2% in the data/simulation efficiency correction factor [65]. This uncertainty has an effect of 8% on the tt\u03b3 background, 23% on the single top quark background, and a negligible effect on the signal. The theoretical uncertainty in the tt\u03b3 and Z\u03b3+jets production cross section is 20% [14]. The theoretical uncertainty is evaluated with vbfnlo by varying the renormalization and factorization scales, each by factors of 1/2 and 2 with the requirement that the two scales remain equal. The envelope of all the variations is taken as the uncertainty. The JHEP06 2017  Figure 3.

The L M,5 operator is found to be non-Hermitian and needs to be replaced by a summation of the original and its Hermitian conjugate (see appendix A for the definition). The presence of aQGCs should lead to an enhancement of the EW W\u03b3+2 jets cross section, which should become more pronounced at the high-energy tails of some distributions. As shown in figure 4, the p W T distribution is sensitive to the aQGCs and therefore is used to set limits. We choose a p W T distribution binned over the range 50-250 GeV, with the overflow contribution included in the last bin. The shape of the distribution at high p W",

This test statistic is assumed to follow a \u03c7 2 distribution [73,74]. One can therefore extract the limits directly by using the delta log-likelihood function \u2206NLL = t \u03b1 /2 [75]. Table 4 lists 95% CL exclusion limits for all parameters. Because of the nonrenormalizable nature of higher-dimensional operators, any nonzero aQGC parameter violates unitarity at high energies. An effective theory is therefore only valid at low energies, and we need to check that the energy scale we probe is less than a new physics scale and does not violate unitarity. Sometimes a form factor is introduced to unitarize the high-energy contribution within that energy range; however, the form factor complicates the limit-setting procedure and makes it difficult to compare results among experiments. We use vbfnlo without any form factors to calculate the unitarity bound corresponding to the maximum aQGC enhancements, which would conserve unitarity within the range of energies probed at the 8 TeV LHC [53,76].
