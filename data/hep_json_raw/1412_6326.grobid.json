            "text": "The strong coupling constant \u03b1 s is one of the three fundamental gauge coupling constants of the Standard Model of particle physics and it is thus of utmost importance to measure it with high precision. Hadronic \u03c4 decays provide an especially clean environment for the study of QCD effects and in particular the determination of \u03b1 s . At the \u03c4 mass scale, its value is predicted to be larger than that at higher energy due to the energy dependence based on the renormalization group equations. Consequently, the hadronic branching ratio of the tau decays B(\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 ) is expected to be much larger than the predicted value of 3/5 at the quark-parton level and ignoring quark masses. The sizable deviation is indeed measured and this has been used together with the measured spectral functions of the \u03c4 hadronic decays to determine \u03b1 s (m 2 \u03c4 ) as well as small non-perturbative contributions using a method proposed in [1].",

The second one in 2013 [5] updated the non-strange spectral functions by using a new and more robust method [15] to unfold the measured mass spectra from detector effects. The procedure also corrected a problem in the correlations between the unfolded mass bins missing in the previous spectral functions [16].  The comparison of the new spectral functions with the old one is shown in Fig. 1 for two example cases. Reasonable agreement is found everywhere except for differences at the few percent level in the \u03c0\u03c0 0 mode near threshold and in the 0.8 \u2212 1.0 GeV 2 region.",

The dashed line depicts the naive parton model prediction while the solid line shows the massless perturbative QCD prediction using \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.120. Although the statistical power of the data is weak near the kinematic limit, the trend of the spectral functions clearly indicates the asymptotic region is not reached for V and A. On the other hand, the oscillating behavior of the V + A does approximately reach the asymptotic limit. This implies that the non-perturbative effects in V + A are smaller than those from V or A as it was observed indeed from the individual fits to these spectral functions. Consequently, the \u03b1 s (m 2 \u03c4 ) determination from V + A is believed to be the most robust one among the three spectral functions.",

Only two recent determinations [25,26] were obtained using the spectral functions of OPAL. One major difference of the latter determinations with the others is the introduction of duality violation with a model containing four additional parameters. This together with the limited precision of the OPAL data explained larger uncertainties on these \u03b1 s determinations. 1 1 During the workshop, another determination based on the same method was reported using the new spectral functions of ALEPH [5], details of the analysis are available after the workshop in [27].

The impact of the revised spectral functions of ALEPH on \u03b1 s (m 2 \u03c4 ) is found to be small. It is one of the few \u03b1 s measurements performed with perturbative predictions known at fourth-order. Because the \u03b1 s uncertainty scales with \u03b1 2 s , when it is extrapolated to the Z mass, it yields one of the most precise \u03b1 s determinations. The good agreement with the other independent measurements at the Z mass pole also tests the asymptotic freedom of the QCD with unprecedented precision.",
