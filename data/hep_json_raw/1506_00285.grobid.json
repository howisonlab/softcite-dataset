The decay products of each Higgs boson are reconstructed as a highmomentum bb system with either a pair of small-radius jets or a single large-radius jet, the latter exploiting jet substructure techniques and associated b-tagged track-jets. No evidence for resonant or non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is observed. The data are interpreted in the context of the Randall-Sundrum model with a warped extra dimension as well as the two-Higgs-doublet model. An upper limit on the cross-section for pp \u2192 G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb of 3.2 (2.3) fb is set for a Kaluza-Klein graviton G * KK mass of 1.0 (1.5) TeV, at the 95 % confidence level. The search for non-resonant Standard Model hh production sets an observed 95 % confidence level upper limit on the production cross-section \u03c3 ( pp \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb) of 202 fb, compared to a Standard Model prediction of \u03c3 ( pp \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb) = 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 fb.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson (h) [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) [3,4] motivates an enhanced effort to search for new physics via the Higgs sector. Many new physics models predict rates of Higgs boson pair production significantly higher than the SM rate [5][6][7]. For example, TeV-scale resonances such as the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the graviton, G * KK , predicted in the bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [8,9] or the heavy neutral scalar, H , of two-Higgsdoublet models (2HDM) [10] can decay into pairs of Higgs bosons, hh. Enhanced non-resonant pp \u2192 hh production can arise in models such as those with new, light, coloured scalars [11], or direct tthh vertices [12,13]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch ATLAS has carried out a search in the bb\u03b3\u03b3 final state [14], setting limits on both resonant (masses between 260 GeV and 500 GeV) and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. CMS has searched in the multi-lepton and multilepton + photons final-states in the context of 2HDM extensions of the Higgs sector [15]. CMS has also searched for narrow resonances in the bbbb channel [16].",

            "text": "Recent phenomenological studies have demonstrated that despite the fully hadronic final state being subject to a large multijet background, searches for new physics in the pp \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb process have good sensitivity for both resonant [17,18] and non-resonant signals [19]. One contributing factor to this sensitivity is the high expected branching ratio for h \u2192 bb. The analysis presented in this paper is designed to search for two high-momentum bb systems with masses consistent with m h , where each bb system contains two jets identified as containing b-hadrons (the jets are \"btagged\"). Compared to a more inclusive bbbb final-state analysis, this topology has many benefits due to the large required momentum and angular separation between the two bb systems: (i) excellent rejection of all backgrounds; (ii) highly efficient triggering using b-tagged multijet triggers; and (iii) negligible combinatorial ambiguity in forming Higgs boson candidates.",

            "text": "Two Higgs boson reconstruction techniques, which are complementary in their acceptance, are presented. The first -\"resolved\" -technique reconstructs Higgs boson candidates from pairs of nearby anti\u2212k t jets [20] with radius parameter R = 0.4, each b-tagged with a multivariate b-tagging algorithm [21]. This resolved technique offers good efficiency over a wide range of Higgs boson momenta and so can be used to reconstruct di-Higgs-boson resonances with mass m X in the range between 500 and 1500 GeV. The sensitivity is best for this technique in the range 500 \u2264 m X 1100 GeV. It can be seen in Fig. 1 however, that the acceptance for four b-tagged anti\u2212k t R = 0.4 jets decreases for m X 1200 GeV. This loss of acceptance is due to the increased boost of the Higgs boson, which reduces the average separation between the b-andb-quarks from the Higgs boson decay, R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 , to values below 0.4. This motivates the use of a second -\"boosted\" -Higgs boson reconstruction technique that maintains acceptance for these higher-mass resonances through the use of jet substructure techniques. The Higgs boson candidate is reconstructed as a single, trimmed [22] anti\u2212k t R = 1.0 jet which must be associated with two b-tagged anti\u2212k t R = 0.3 trackjets [23]. The use of track-jets with a smaller R parameter allows Higgs bosons with higher transverse momentum ( p T ) to be reconstructed.",

It consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip tracker, and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker. The system is surrounded by a solenoid that produces a 2 T axial magnetic field.

The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with liquid-argon calorimeters for both electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer is operated in a magnetic field provided by air-core superconducting toroids and includes tracking chambers for precise muon momentum measurements up to |\u03b7| = 2.7 and trigger chambers covering the range |\u03b7| < 2.4. A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events [25]. The Level-1 trigger reduces the event rate to below 75 kHz using hardware-based trigger algorithms acting on a subset of detector information. Two software-based trigger levels, referred to collectively as the High-Level Trigger (HLT), further reduce the event rate to about 400 Hz using information from the entire detector.",

Signal samples for both models studied are generated with Madgraph v1.5.1 [27,28], interfaced to Pythia v8.175 [29] for parton showering, hadronization and underlying-event simulation. The Higgs boson mass is set to 125 GeV. The CTEQ6L1 [30] leadingorder (LO) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used. Table 1 provides the calculated cross-sections and widths for different signal model parameters. The bulk RS model predictions are calculated at LO using Madgraph. The 2HDM prediction corresponds to the cross-section for gluon-fusion production plus b-associated production plus vector-bosonfusion production. The gluon-fusion cross-section is calculated using SusHi v1.3.0 [31][32][33][34][35][36] at next-to-next-to-leadingorder (NNLO) accuracy in QCD. For b-associated production, an empirical matching of the four-and five-flavour scheme is used [37]. The four-flavour cross-section is calculated at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD following Refs. [38,39], while the five-flavour cross-section is calculated at NNLO in QCD using SusHi. The vector-bosonfusion cross-section at NNLO accuracy in QCD and NLO in electroweak is taken from Ref. [40] and corrected by a multiplicative factor of cos 2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) [10]. The 2HDM branching ratios are calculated using 2HDMC v1.6.4 [41]. For the G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb signal, three sets of MC samples are generated for each of the three coupling values, k/M Pl = 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. The variation in these couplings alters both the total G * KK production cross-section and its width. Samples cover a range of G * KK masses 500 \u2264 m G * KK \u2264 2000 GeV. For the H \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb signal, samples are generated covering the range 500 \u2264 m H \u2264 1500 GeV. Since the width of H , H , varies non-trivially with the 2HDM parameters, the samples are generated with fixed H = 1 GeV. In order to make 2HDM interpretations of the results obtained with these fixed width samples, they are corrected to account for the true resonance width at each point in parameter space, as described in Sect. 6.",

The effects of pile-up on jet energies are accounted for by a jet-area-based correction [64]. The jets are then calibrated using p T -and \u03b7-dependent calibration factors based on MC simulations and the combination of several in situ techniques applied to data [65]. Following this, the jets undergo Global Sequential calibration [63] which reduces flavour-dependent differences in calorimeter response. If a muon with p T > 4 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 is found within a cone of R = 0.4 around the jet axis, the four-momentum Table 2 Summary of MC event generators, PDF sets, parton shower and hadronization used in the analysis for both signal and background processes. \u2020 Madgraph was modified [62] to use the exact top-loop form-factors from HPAIR [5,42]  of the muon is added to that of the jet (after correcting for the expected energy deposited by the muon in the calorimeter). Such muons are reconstructed by combining measurements from the inner tracking and muon spectrometer systems, and are required to satisfy tight muon identification quality criteria [66]. Jets with a significant energy contribution from pileup interactions [67] are removed using tracking information. For jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, the p T sum of tracks matched to the jet is calculated and it is required that at least 50 % of this p T sum is due to tracks originating from the primary vertex. 2 Jets with |\u03b7| < 2.5 are b-tagged using the properties of the tracks associated with them, the most important being the impact parameter (defined as the track's distance of closest approach to the primary vertex in the transverse plane) of each track, as well as the presence and properties of displaced vertices. The MV1 b-tagging algorithm [21] used in this analysis combines the above information using a neural network and is configured to achieve an efficiency of 70 % for tagging b-jets, 3 with a charm-jet rejection of approximately 5 and a light-quark or gluon jet rejection of around 140, as determined in an MC sample of tt events. The b-tagging efficiency in the simulation is scaled to reproduce the one measured in data [68].",

The event selection begins with the requirement of at least four b-tagged jets, each with p T > 40 GeV (shown in Fig. 2 as \"4 b-tagged jets\"). SM non-resonant Higgs boson pair production has a softer Higgs boson p T spectrum than the m X = 500 GeV resonances, resulting in a lower 2 Proton-proton collision vertices are reconstructed requiring that at least five tracks with p T > 0.4 GeV are associated with a given vertex. The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest summed track p 2 T . 3  A \u00d7 \u03b5 = 4.9 % for this requirement. The four highestp T btagged jets are then used to form two dijet systems, demanding that the angular distance, R, between the jets in each of the dijets is smaller than 1.5. The transverse momentum of the leading (in p T ) dijet system, p lead T , is required to be greater than 200 GeV, while the subleading dijet system must have p subl T > 150 GeV. In the rare case that a jet could be used to create more than one dijet which satisfies the above kinematic requirements, the dijet with the highest mass is chosen. Thus two unique dijet systems, with no jets in common, are selected (shown as \"2 dijets\" in Fig. 2). For SM nonresonant Higgs boson pair production, after this requirement, A \u00d7\u03b5 = 1.2 %. The impact of different decay kinematics can be seen by comparing Fig. 2b to Fig. 2a: the decay of spin-0 H bosons gives a softer Higgs boson p T spectrum than in the case of the spin-2 G * KK decay (due to the differing angular distributions of hh), resulting in lower acceptance for these kinematic requirements at low resonance mass.",

The t is measured using an independent \"semileptonic tt\" data sample that has a high tt purity. Events in this sample are selected by requiring one dijet candidate to pass the nominal selection with p T >150 GeV and one \"leptonic top-quark\" candidate. The leptonic top quark candidate is defined using a reconstructed muon and one b-tagged jet. This b-tagged jet is required to be distinct from jets in the dijet candidate, and the muon is required to have p T >25 GeV, be isolated, and fall within a cone of radius 1.2 around the b-tagged jet. The leptonic top quark candidate is required to have p T >180 GeV, where the leptonic top p T is defined as the vector sum of the b-jet p T , the muon p T , and the missing transverse momentum in the event. The latter is reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeter, including corrections for identified jets, electrons and muons.

The JER uncertainty is evaluated by smearing jet energies according to the systematic uncertainties of the resolution measurement performed with data [65]. For b-jets with p T < 300 GeV the uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency is evaluated by propagating the systematic uncertainty in the measured tagging efficiency for b-jets [68], which ranges from 2 % to 8 % depending on b-jet p T and \u03b7. However, for the higher resonance masses considered in this analysis, there are a significant number of events containing at least one b-jet with p T > 300 GeV. The systematic uncertainties in the tagging efficiencies of these jets are derived from MC simulation and are larger, reaching 24 % for p T > 800 GeV. Systematic uncertainties in the normalization and shape of the multijet background model are assessed in the control region. Table 3 shows the estimated background yields in the control and sideband regions. The control region background prediction agrees with the observed data within the data statistical uncertainty of \u00b13.5 %. To further test the robustness of the background estimation and the assumptions behind it, predictions are made with different sideband and control region definitions and different b-tagging requirements on the 2-tag sample. Redefinitions of the sideband and control region changed the kinematic composition of these regions, enhancing the sideband region in either high mass or low mass dijets and therefore altering the kinematic corrections that are applied. These variations induce a maximum change of \u00b16 % in the estimated multijet yield and so the uncertainty is set to this value. Different b-tagging requirements on the b-tagged dijet in the 2-tag sample are used in order to change the composition of the sample and to vary the degree of btagging-related kinematic bias.

Due to the large statistical uncertainties of the 4-tag tt sample, the assigned shape uncertainty is large: \u223c30 % and \u223c100 % in the event yield at m 4j = 400 GeV and 1500 GeV, respectively. Table 4 shows the relative impact of the uncertainties in the event yields. Figure 5 shows the relative impact on the expected limit for \u03c3 pp \u2192 G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb . The calculation of the expected limit is described in Sect. 6. It can be seen that for resonance masses below 700 GeV, the effect on the limit is dominated by the multijet description, with a small contribution from the tt background since both backgrounds are predominately at low mass. Above m X = 700 GeV, the uncertainty associated with the modelling of the b-tagging efficiency has the largest impact, since the larger highp T uncertainties have an increasingly important effect with mass. Table 5 shows the predicted number of background events in the signal region, the number of events observed in the data, and the predicted yield for two potential signals. The  KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb 95 % confidence level exclusion limit, as a function of graviton mass. The calculation of the expected limit is described in Sect. 6. Only the mass-dependent uncertainties are shown. The impact is the ratio of the limit calculated using all systematic uncertainties sources to the limit calculated using all systematic uncertainty sources excluding those under investigation numbers of predicted background events and observed events are in excellent agreement. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the predicted m 4j background distribution to that observed in the data. The predicted background agrees with the observed distributions, with no significant deviation.",

Those large-radius jets, denoted by the subscript J in the remainder of this paper, are reconstructed from locally calibrated topological clusters of calorimeter cells [63] using the anti\u2212k t jet clustering algorithm with a radius parameter of R = 1.0. To minimize the impact of energy depositions due to pile-up and the underlying event, the jets are trimmed [22]. This trimming algorithm reconstructs subjets within the large-R jet using the k t algorithm with radius parameter R sub = 0.3, then removes any subjet with p T less than 5 % of the large-R jet p T . Further calibration of both the energy and mass scales is applied as a function of p T and \u03b7 as determined from simulation and in situ measurements [65]. A novel aspect of the boosted technique presented here is the use of track-jets [23] to identify the presence of b-quarks inside the large-R jet. Such track-jets are built solely from The selection efficiency as a function of resonance mass at each stage of the event selection for a G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb events and b H \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb events in the boosted analysis tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, satisfying a set of hit and impact parameter criteria to make sure that those tracks are consistent with originating from the primary vertex, thereby reducing the effects of pile-up. Track jets are reconstructed using the anti\u2212k t algorithm with R = 0.3. Flavour-tagging of those track-jets proceeds in the same way as for the R = 0.4 calorimeter jets used in the resolved analysis described in the previous section, except for a slightly looser requirement on the output of the MV1 neural network for a track-jet to be b-tagged. This leads to b-jets being btagged with an efficiency of 74 %, with a charm-jet rejection factor of approximately 4 and a light-quark or gluon jet rejection factor of around 65, as determined in an MC sample of tt events. The b-tagging efficiency for track-jets in the MC simulation is adjusted based on studies of tt events in the data (Sect. 5.4).",

In this fit, the multijet distribution is extracted from the 2+3-tag data sample, after subtraction of the tt and Z +jets contributions predicted by the MC simulation. The tt and Z +jets distributions in the sideband region of the 4-tag data sample are taken from the MC simulation, but the Z +jets contribution is very small and its distribution is added to the multijet distribution for the fit. The resulting fit values are \u03bc QCD = 0.0071 \u00b1 0.0007 and \u03b1 tt = 1.44 \u00b1 0.50 with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.67 between these two parameters. Figure 10a shows the dijet mass distribution for the 4-tag data sample in the sideband region with the background estimated using the above method. This figure indicates that the 2 + 3-tag sample provides a valid description of the background kinematics in the 4-tag sample. The modelling of the background yield and kinematics is further validated by testing in the control region of the 4-tag data sample. Good agreement is observed between the data and the predicted background in various kinematical distributions for leading and subleading large-R jets, as well as for the dijet mass, as shown in Fig. 10b. The shapes of the tt kinematical distributions in the signal region are determined from the MC simulation requiring only three b-tagged track-jets instead of four due to the limited MC sample size. The number of tt events is then normalized to the expected yield in the 4-tag Data / Bkgd Fig. 9 Leading large-R jet mass distribution for 4-tag events in the sideband region for data (points) and the two dominant sources of background for the boosted analysis. The normalization for each of those two background components is obtained with a fit to the data as described in the text sample times \u03b1 tt . It was checked that this does not introduce a bias discernible with the statistical precision of the tt MC sample.",

            "text": "The signal modelling is affected by two main sources of experimental uncertainty. One is related to large-R jets and the other is related to the efficiency for b-tagging track-jets. For large-R jets, the following uncertainties are accounted for: jet energy scale and resolution, as well as jet mass scale (JMS) and resolution (JMR). In the kinematic region relevant to this analysis, the JES uncertainty is below 2 % and that for JMS is \u223c2-5 %. The JES uncertainty is derived with the \u03b3 -jet balance method for p T < 800 GeV and the trackjets double-ratio method for p T > 800 GeV, as described in Ref. [72]. The latter method is also used for the derivation of JMS uncertainties in the full p T range. An uncertainty of 20 % is applied to account for modelling of the jet energy and mass resolutions. The magnitude of this resolution uncertainty is estimated from studies of boosted W boson production performed using the 2012 data. Jet energy and mass uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated in the statistical analysis. The uncertainty in modelling the b-tagging efficiency for the track-jets used in this analysis is applied to the signal and Z +jets MC samples. It is extracted as a function of p T using the tag-and-probe method on a sample of dilepton events from semileptonic tt decays. The resulting uncertainty varies between 2 % and 7 %, with the largest value obtained for track-jets with p T > 100 GeV. This uncertainty includes the following effects: statistical precision of the calibration data sample, choice of event generator and parton shower for the simulated tt sample, initial-and finalstate radiation, and flavour composition. For p T > 250 GeV, the uncertainties must be evaluated using MC simulation due to the small number of data events. Consequently, the uncertainties increase, reaching 14 % for p T > 600 GeV. Studies in a tt data sample with a single-lepton+jets final state indicate that the presence of nearby jets does not have a measurable effect on the b-tagging efficiency and thus no additional uncertainty is required for nearby jets.",

Similarly, the uncertainty in the shape of other tt kinematical distributions is extracted from those samples. The uncertainty in the shape of the multijet background extracted from the sideband region of the 2 + 3-tag sample is constrained by the level of agreement between the background prediction and the observed data in the control region following the procedure described in Sect. 4.4. Good agreement is observed between the data and the predicted background in both the sideband and control regions of the 4-tag sample as shown in Table 6.

Using the SM hh non-resonant production as the signal model, the observed 95 % CL upper limit is \u03c3 ( pp \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb) = 202 fb. This can be compared to the inclusive SM For the resonant Higgs boson pair production search, the resolved and boosted analyses offer their best sensitivity in complementary resonance mass regions. Figure 13 shows the expected and observed cross-section upper limits from each analysis for pp \u2192 G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb within the bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 1. The resolved analysis can be seen to give a more stringent expected exclusion limit for resonance masses up to 1100 GeV, while the boosted analysis offers better sensitivity beyond that mass. This motivates a simple combination of the separate exclusion limits from the resolved and boosted analyses. For each of the signal models, the limit for each mass point is taken from the analysis which offers the most stringent expected exclusion. Figure 14 shows the combined 95 % CL upper limits for three signal models: pp \u2192 G * KK \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb within the bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 1 and 2, and the pp \u2192 H \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb with a fixed H = 1 GeV. The most stringent limits of \u03c3 pp \u2192 X \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb \u223c 3 fb are set in the range 900 < m X < 1600 GeV, where there is little expected background and either the resolved or boosted analysis provides good signal acceptance. The excluded mass ranges for the bulk RS KK graviton are shown in Table 9.",
