The fiducial region studied contains exactly one lepton with transverse momentum p T > 30 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | < 2.1, with exactly two b jets with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 and no other jets with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.7.

            "text": "The measurement of W or Z boson production in association with b quarks in proton-proton collisions provides important input for refinement of calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics and is also relevant for searches and measurements. In particular, these processes constitute a background to the experimental measurement of a standard model (SM) Higgs boson in which the Higgs boson decays into a bb pair in association with a vector boson. The discovery by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC of a neutral boson with a mass of about 125 GeV [1][2][3][4] motivates further studies to establish the nature of the boson and determine its coupling to bottom quarks. Furthermore, different models based on extensions of the Higgs sector are being compared with LHC data using final states composed of leptons and b jets. In this context, a better understanding of the b hadron production mechanism and the kinematic properties of associated jets is required to refine the background predictions and increase the sensitivity to new physics. Throughout this paper,hadronic showers originating from bottom or antie-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch bottom quarks are referred to as b jets, and b-tagged jets are the reconstructed objects either in simulation or data that have been identified as such.",

The CSV algorithm combines information about impact parameter significance, secondary vertex kinematic properties, and jet kinematic properties in a likelihood-ratio discriminator. The identification of b jets (b tagging) is made by imposing a minimum threshold on the CSV discriminator value. In this analysis, b-tagged jets are required to pass a threshold with an efficiency of 40% in the signal phase space and a misidentification probability of 0.1% (1%) for light (charm) jets. Jets are corrected for the difference in efficiency between data and simulation using scale factors dependent on the p T of the jet.",

These samples are interfaced with pythia 6.4 [33] for hadronization using the Z2* tune for the underlying event. The most recent pythia Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [34], which uses the CTEQ5L PDF set, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L [32]. The k T -MLM [35,36] matching scheme is used. For the signal distributions, the shapes are taken from a dedicated high-statistics generated sample of exclusive W+bb. The normalization is obtained from the W+bb component of an inclusive W+jets sample by separating the W+jets simulated sample into three subsamples labeled as W+bb, W+cc, and W+udscg, which are defined below. If an event contains a bottom jet from the matrix element or parton shower, it is categorized as W+bb. A bottom quark at generator level requires the presence of a bottom hadron within a cone of radius \u0394R = 0.4 with respect to the jet axis. The jets are constructed using generator-level information using all stable particles in the event, excluding neutrinos. Jets with a distance smaller than \u0394R = 0.5 with respect to a lepton are removed from the event. If an event does not contain any b jet, but an even, nonzero number of charm jets, again from the matrix element or parton shower, it is categorized as W+cc. The remaining events are categorized as W+udscg. The energy of the selected leptons at the generator level is cor-rected for final-state radiation by summing the four-momenta of all the photons generated within a cone of radius \u0394R = 0.1 around the lepton. Leptons that do not originate from the primary vertex are not considered for selection.",

The column labeled \"Variation\" indicates the bounds on the normalization change of a given sample due to a variation of the uncertainty by one standard deviation. The last column indicates the contribution of the given systematic to the overall uncertainty in the measured cross section. The uncertainty labeled \"b tag eff rescaling\" is the uncertainty associated with the rescaling of the b tagging efficiency. UES refers to the scale of energy deposits not clustered into jets, and MES and EES refer to the muon and electron energy scales. The uncertainty labeled as \"Id/Iso/Trg\" is the uncertainty associated with the efficiency of the lepton identification, isolation, and trigger.  where L is the integrated luminosity, N data reconstructed is the number of observed signal events, N MC reconstructed is the number of expected signal events from simulation reconstructed in the fiducial region, N MC generated is the number of generated events in the fiducial region, A and are the acceptance and efficiency, \u03b1 is the measured signal strength in the given lepton channel, and \u03c3 gen is the simulated fiducial cross section of the signal sample. The signal strength is the scale factor in the W+bb cross section predicted by the fit, after factoring out contributions to the overall change in normalization due to systematic effects which are correlated across samples. In this analysis, the fiducial cross section is calculated as follows: MadGraph is used to compute the W+bb cross section with fiducial selections applied. Then a k-factor for inclusive W production is applied that is obtained from the ratio of the inclusive W cross section calculated with fewz 3.1 (at NNLO using the five-flavour CTEQ6M PDF set) and to that with MadGraph. The product A is 10 to 15% and results from the combined effects of the efficiency of the lepton identification requirements (80%) and b tagging efficiency (40% per jet) and has an uncertainty of 10%, arising from scale and PDF choices as indicated in the bottom of Table 1. The W+bb cross section is measured within a fiducial volume, which is defined by requiring leptons with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1 and exactly two b-tagged jets of p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.

In the four-and five-flavour approaches, the four and five lightest quark flavours are used in the proton PDF sets. In the fiveflavour scheme, the PDF set CTEQ6L is used and interfaced with pythia 6 using the Z2* tune. The two four-flavour samples are produced using an NNLO PDF set interfaced with Table 3 Measured cross sections in the muon, electron, and combined lepton channels.

Comparisons between the results of calculations performed under different assumptions provide important feedback on the validity of the techniques employed. Differences in predictions arising from the modelling of b quarks as massive or massless are possible, as are variations in predictions arising from the use of different showering packages (pythia 6 vs. pythia 8) or matrix element generators (MadGraph vs. mcfm 7.0). In the phase space explored here, these predictions are all very close in their central value and agree with each other well within their respective uncertainties.",
