The measurement uses a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected during a special low-luminosity running that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.4 \u00b1 0.5 pb \u22121 . The production of W bosons is studied in both electron and muon decay modes, while the production of Z bosons is studied using only the dimuon decay channel. The ratios of W \u2212 to W + and Z to W differential cross sections are also measured. The measured differential cross sections and ratios are compared with theoretical predictions up to next-to-next leading order in QCD.",

In a fixed-order perturbation theory, such a description shows a divergent behaviour of the p T spectrum in the low-p T region, which is sensitive to initial-state radiation and nonperturbative effects [1]. The high-p T region is more sensitive to perturbative effects [2]; thus the experimental measurement of p V T constitutes a crucial test for both nonperturbative and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations.",

The D0 Collaboration measured the differential cross sections of Z/\u03b3 * production in the muon channel [8] and the p T distribution of Z/\u03b3 * production in the electron or muon channel in proton-antiproton collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [9][10][11]. The high yield of W and Z boson events at the CERN LHC enables detailed studies of weak vector boson production mechanisms in different kinematic regions. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have performed several measurements of W and Z boson production via leptonic decays measured at both \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. Measurements have been made of the inclusive W and Z boson cross sections in both electrons and muons [3,12,13] and of the Drell-Yan (DY) production differential cross section d\u03c3/dm, where m is dilepton invariant mass [14,15]. The cross sections as a function of p T are measured for Z bosons [4,[16][17][18] and W bosons [19], but the latter has only been measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The LHCb Collaboration has measured the forward W and Z boson production cross sections and spectra for various kinematic variables at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV using decays to lepton pairs [20][21][22][23][24][25]. All of the results are consistent with standard model (SM) expectations.",

A correction is included in the isolation variables to account for the neutral particles from pileup and underlying events. For electrons, the average transverse-momentum density \u03c1 is calculated in each event by using the \"jet area\" A jet [51], where \u03c1 is defined as the median of the p jet T /A jet distribution for all jets coming from pileup in the event, where p jet T is the transverse momentum of a jet. This density is convolved with the effective area A eff of the isolation cone, where the effective area A eff is the geometric area of the isolation cone times an \u03b7-dependent correction factor that accounts for the residual dependence of the isolation on pileup. For muons, the correction is applied by subtracting p PU T multiplied by a factor 0.5. This factor corresponds approximately to the ratio of neutral to charged particle production in the hadronization process. The W boson events are selected if I e PF < 0.15 or I \u00b5 PF < 0.12.",

They include the determination of the correction factors for the lepton efficiency (reconstruction, isolation, and trigger), the electron or muon momentum resolution parameters, and the construction of the response matrices for unfolding the detector resolution and FSR effects. The simulated distributions are corrected for the efficiency differences between data and simulation using scale factors obtained from the tag-and-probe method. The variation of the measured scale factors due to different choices of signal and background models and the p T and \u03b7 binnings for the measured lepton are treated as sys- tematic uncertainties. The momentum resolution is estimated by comparing data and the simulated Z boson mass distribution. The uncertainties in the parameterization of the mass distribution are propagated in the resolution calculation. The uncertainty in the modeldependent FSR simulation is estimated by reweighting the simulated data samples. We are using event-dependent weights from a soft collinear approach [56] and higher-order corrections in \u03b1(p 2 T ) [57]. The difference in signal yields before and after reweighting is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty in the luminosity measurement is completely canceled out since the results are presented as normalized distributions.",

A set of pseudo-experiments is generated by varying all parameters of the equation within their uncertainties. The bias in the measured values with the pseudo-experiments provides the systematic uncertainty in the parameterization of the shape. An additional uncertainty is assigned due to the simultaneous fit procedure by floating the tail parameter \u03c3 1 in the extraction of the signal yields.

The ratios with the total uncertainty are listed in table 5. The powheg calculation shows good agreement with the data in the low-and high-p V T regions, but overestimates the ratio by up to 10% in the transition region at around p V T = 10 GeV. The ResBos expectation also shows behavior similar to powheg, but it has larger than expected uncertainties because it employs different strategies in terms of the scale and PDF variations for the W and Z boson generation, which technically results in no cancellation for their ratio. fewz predictions describe the data well for p V T > 20 GeV. In figure 8 the ratio of differential cross sections for the Z boson production measured at two different centre-of-mass energies, 7 and 8 TeV [18], are shown for the muon channel, separately for low-and high-p Z T regions. The theoretical predictions describe the data well within the experimental uncertainties.",
