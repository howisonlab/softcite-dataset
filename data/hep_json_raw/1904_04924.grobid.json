In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial neural networks can be used to reconstruct the mass of a di-system and compare this procedure to an algorithm used by the CMS Collaboration for this purpose. We find that the neural network output shows a smaller bias and better resolution of the di-mass reconstruction and an improved discrimination between a Higgs boson signal and the Drell-Yan background with a much shorter computation time.",

            "text": "Tau leptons can be produced singly or in pairs through the decay of heavier mesons and baryons, or through the decay of Standard Model bosons that are created in particle collisions. The 0 \u2215 * and Higgs (H) bosons are the only particles that can mediate resonant di-production, and Higgs boson production has been recently observed in this decay by the CMS and ATLAS experiment at CERN [1,2]. The reconstruction of the di-system invariant mass is fundamental in distinguishing between the Z and the Higgs boson. The dominant background in identifying the H \u2192 \u2212 + signal is the Drell-Yan (DY) process of di-production, therefore, it is important to distinguish between the two processes. However, the reconstruction of the mass of the disystem is challenging. The lepton decays after a short time into leptons or hadrons, both accompanied by neutrinos. Charged leptons and hadrons can be observed in the detector, thus they are called visible particles in this paper. Neutrinos, on the other hand, interact very weakly with matter and escape the experiment undetected, but can be identified in a relatively hermetic detector as used in the CMS and ATLAS experiments [3,4] as an imbalance in the measured momentum calculated in the transverse plane. The missing transverse momentum (MET) is defined as the negative vectorial sum of momenta in the transverse plane of all the visible particles produced in the collision. The momentum of the neutrinos in the beam direction, on the other hand, cannot be quantified, because it depends on the momentum of the quarks and gluons within the proton before the collision, which is only known statistically and not in any individual event.",

One is based on a likelihood method to reconstruct the mass on an event-by-event basis [5], while the second, improved algorithm employs a likelihood function of arbitrary normalization [6]. The latter algorithm is additionally able to reconstruct the kinematic properties of the di-system. The ATLAS and CDF Collaborations use a Missing Mass Calculation (MMC) method that is based on minimizing a likelihood function in the kinematically allowed detector phase space [7]. The method presented in this paper is based on an artificial neural network (called neural network or NN from now on) to reconstruct the mass of the di-system. The neural network is implemented with the Python deep learning library ''Keras'' [8] and can be trained with a data set of simulated di-events, which contain all the known parameters of the visible particles and missing energy from neutrinos as input, and the mass of the simulated di-system as a training target. After the training, the neural network is able to calculate an approximate value of the mass of the di-system using the known parameters of the visible particles and the missing energy for any event with two leptons.",

The MET must be greater than 20 GeV for all events, in order to make sure that the neutrino momenta are not pointing in opposite directions. For events where both leptons decay leptonically, the \u2215 with the higher T must satisfy T > 20 GeV and | | < 2.4, with the other \u2215 satisfying T > 10 GeV and | | < 2.4. For events where only one lepton decays leptonically, the \u2215 must satisfy T > 20 GeV and | | < 2.1, with the vectorial sum of the visible decay products of the hadronically decaying lepton having T > 30 GeV and | | < 2.3. For the case of events with two leptons decaying hadronically, both vectorial sums must have T > 20 GeV and | | < 2.1. Fig. 1 shows the generated mass and visible mass spectrum for the simulated Higgs boson decaying to leptons. The mass corresponds to the true value of the mediator, while the visible mass is obtained by summing the momenta of the final state decay particles, not including the neutrinos. The digen mass spectrum is not flat due to selection requirements that are related to detector acceptance and identification effects. The visible mass of the di-system (visible digen mass) shows a much different spectrum. In order to separate signal from background, it is desirable to achieve a di-mass as close to the generated value as possible, and so information about the neutrino products must be inferred to improve the mass resolution. To prevent the neural network from learning the mass distribution of the training sample instead of the relationship between the inputs and the training target, the training sample consists of events from all the different Higgs boson masses, with the same number of events for each mass value.",

Because there are more events in the higher mass range, this effect can most significantly be seen in the range of 250 GeV to 300 GeV. The deviations at the mass range limits are most probably caused by the distribution of events in the training sample, which does not contain any events below 80 GeV or above 300 GeV.

The Higgs boson signal and the DY background have the same number of events and are not normalized according to their cross section. The signal to background significance in the range of 115-135 GeV for SVfit is 11.2 \u00b1 0.1 and for the neural network 16.5\u00b10.2, where the cross section taken for the DY background is = 1418 \u00b1 1 pb and the cross section assumed for the production of a 125 GeV mass Higgs boson is = 0.7002 \u00b1 0.0006 pb for a centerof-mass energy of 13 TeV, both as obtained with MadGraph [9]. The integrated luminosity is set to a value of \ue238 = 100 fb \u22121 , similar to the data sets collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments until the end of 2017. The efficiency is the number of events in the signal range divided by the total number of events passing the requirements in Section 2. The DY background events are slightly biased towards higher masses since the neural network is only trained for masses of 80 GeV and above. Using a larger mass range of the training sample would lead to a smaller deviation for the DY background and therefore to an even larger signal to background significance. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the resolution per di-mass using either the neural network or SVfit.

The computation time, once the neural network is trained, is much shorter than using SVfit, as shown in Section 4.3. Despite those advantages, the neural network has a few drawbacks. The construction of a neural network model, which delivers predictions close to the target values, is time consuming because a slight modification in the model can change the predictions drastically. This is due to the fact that the neural network is trained multiple times with a large sample of events.

The predictions of the neural network are compared to the results using the SVfit likelihood technique, which is currently used by the CMS Collaboration to reconstruct the di-mass. For the neural network, the bias in the reconstructed mass is \u22120.1% and the mass resolution is 8.4%, whereas SVfit has a bias of 6% and a mass resolution of 17%. The signal to background significance of a Higgs boson signal with a mass of 125 GeV and Drell-Yan background using the neural network is 16.5\u00b10.2 and shows an improvement with respect to SVfit, which has a signal to background significance of 11.2 \u00b1 0.1. Using a neural network instead of SVfit improves the performance of the di-mass reconstruction significantly. The neural network predicts the di-mass approximately fifty thousand times faster than SVfit. With the neural network technique, one must factor a few hours of retraining each time the detector reconstruction or data conditions change in order to ensure that it performs without bias. This extra computing time is not significant, and is commonplace in other machine learning software algorithms in today's experiments. Using a carefully-optimized neural network for reconstruction of the invariant mass of di-resonances has significant advantages over common approaches, delivering better mass resolution, reduced bias, and a much faster computation time.",
