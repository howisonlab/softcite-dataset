The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction.

Cosmological observations demonstrate that around 85% of the matter in the universe is comprised of DM [4] and they are largely consistent with the hypothesis that DM is composed primarily of weakly interacting massive particles. If nongravitational interactions exist between DM and SM particles, DM could be produced by colliding SM particles at high energy. Assuming the pair production of DM particles in hadron collisions occurs through a spin-0 or spin-1 bosonic mediator coupled to the initial-state particles, the DM particles leave the detector without measurable signatures. If DM particles are produced in association with a detectable SM particle, which could be emitted as initialstate radiation from the interacting constituents of the cole-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch liding protons, or through new effective couplings between DM and SM particles, their existence could be inferred via a large transverse momentum imbalance in the collision event.",

As the bb decay mode has the largest branching fraction of all Higgs boson decay modes allowed in the SM, it provides the largest signal yield. The search is performed using the data set collected by the CMS experiment [11] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 35.9 fb \u22121 . Similar searches have been conducted at the LHC by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, analyzing data collected at 8 [12] and 13 TeV [13,14]. Results are interpreted in terms of two simplified models predicting this signature. The first is a type-2 two-Higgs doublet model extended by an additional light pseudoscalar boson a (2HDM+a) [15]. The a boson mixes with the scalar and pseudoscalar partners of the observed Higgs boson, and decays to a pair of DM particles, \u03c7 \u03c7. The second is a baryonic Z model [10], in which a \"baryonic Higgs\" boson mixes with the SM Higgs boson. In this model, a vector mediator Z is exchanged in the s-channel and, after the radiation of an SM Higgs boson, decays to two DM particles. Representative Feynman diagrams for the two models are presented in Fig. 1.",

            "text": "In the 2HDM+a model, the DM particle candidate \u03c7 is a fermion that can couple to SM particles only through a spin-0, pseudoscalar mediator. Since the couplings of the new spin-0 mediator to SM gauge bosons are strongly suppressed, the 2HDM+a model is consistent with measurements of the SM Higgs boson production and decay modes, which so far show no significant deviation from SM predictions [16]. In contrast to previously explored two-Higgs doublet models [9,12,13,17], the 2HDM+a framework ensures gauge invariance and renormalizability. In this model there are six mass eigenstates. Two are charge-parity (CP)-even scalars: the light h, assumed to be the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson, and the heavy H. These are the result of the mixing of the neutral CP-even weak eigenstates with a mixing angle \u03b1. The two CP-odd pseudoscalar mass eigenstates are the light a and the heavy A, which are linear combinations of the CP-odd weak eigenstates, with a mixing angle \u03b8 . Finally, there are two heavy charged scalars H \u00b1 with identical mass. The masses of a and A, the angle \u03b8 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of h and H, tan \u03b2, are varied in this search. The mixing angle \u03b1 changes with \u03b2 following the relation \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c0/2. Perturbativity and unitarity put restrictions on the magnitudes and the signs of the three quartic couplings \u03bb 3 , \u03bb P1 , \u03bb P2 , and we set their values to \u03bb 3 = \u03bb P1 = \u03bb P2 = 3 [15]. The masses of the charged Higgs bosons and of the heavy CP-even Higgs boson are assumed to be the same as the mass of the heavy pseudoscalar, i.e., m H = m H \u00b1 = m A . When performing a scan in the m Am a plane, tan \u03b2 is assumed to be 1 and sin \u03b8 is assumed to be 0.35, following the recommendations in Ref. [18]. The DM particle \u03c7 is assumed to have a mass of m \u03c7 = 10 GeV. For tan \u03b2 1, the coupling strengths of both a and A to b quarks are enhanced, and effects from bb-initiated production are included in the signal simulation for all values of tan \u03b2.",

Thus, the search strategy followed imposes requirements on the mass of the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate, which is also required to be Lorentz-boosted. Together with the identification of the hadronization products of the two b quarks produced in the Higgs boson decay, these requirements define a data sample that is expected to be enriched in signal events. Several different SM processes can mimic this topology, the most important of which are top quark pair production and the production of a vector boson (V) in association with multiple jets. For each of these SM processes that constitute the largest sources of background, statistically independent data samples are used to predict the hadronic recoil distributions.

To model the contributions from SM Higgs boson processes as well as from the tt and single top quark backgrounds, we use the powheg v2 [22][23][24] generator. These processes are generated at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. The tt production cross section is further corrected using calculations at the next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD including corrections for soft-gluon radiation estimated with next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy [25]. Events with multiple jets produced via the strong interaction (referred to as QCD multijet events) are generated at LO using MadGraph5_amc@nlo v2.2.2 with up to four partons in the matrix element calculations. The MLM prescription [26] is used for matching these partons to parton shower jets. Simulated samples of Z+jets and W+jets processes are generated at LO using MadGraph5_amc@nlo v2.3.3. Up to four additional partons are considered in the matrix element and matched to their parton showers using the MLM technique. The V+jets (V = W, Z) samples are corrected by weighting the p T of the respective boson with NLO QCD corrections obtained from large samples of events generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo and the FxFx merging technique [27] with up to two additional jets stemming from the matrix element calculations. These samples are further corrected by applying NLO electroweak corrections [28][29][30] that depend on the boson p T . Predictions for the SM diboson production modes WW, WZ, and ZZ are obtained at LO with the pythia 8.205 [31] generator and normalized to NLO accuracy using mcfm v6.0 [32].",

The energy of photons is obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. The PF candidates are then used to construct the physics objects described in this section. At large Lorentz boosts, the two b quarks from the Higgs boson decay may produce jets that overlap and make their individual reconstruction difficult. In this search large-area jets clustered from PF candidates using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [40] with a distance parameter of 1.5 (CA15 jets) are utilized to identify the Higgs boson candidate. The large cone size is chosen in order to select signal events where the Higgs boson has a medium Lorentz-boost and hence its decay products begin to merge for p T (h) 200 GeV. To reduce the impact of particles arising from pileup interactions, the four-vector of each PF candidate is scaled with a weight calculated with the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [41] prior to the clustering. The absolute jet energy scale is corrected using calibrations derived from data [42]. The CA15 jets are also required to be central (|\u03b7| < 2.4). The \"soft-drop\" (SD) jet grooming algorithm [43] is applied to remove soft wide-angle radiation from the jets. We refer to the mass of the groomed CA15 jet as m SD .",

Identification criteria [47] based on the ECAL shower shape and the consistency of the electron track with the primary vertex are imposed. Muon candidates are selected by two different reconstruction approaches [48]: one in which tracks in the silicon tracker are matched to a track segment in the muon detector, and another in which a track fit spanning the silicon tracker and muon detector is performed starting with track segments in the muon detector. Further identification criteria are imposed on muon candidates to reduce the number of hadrons and poorly measured mesons misidentified as muons [48]. These additional criteria include requirements on the number of hits in the tracker and in the muon systems, the fit quality of the global muon track, and the track's consistency with the primary vertex. Muon candidates with |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered in this analysis. A minimum p T of 10 GeV is required for electron and muon candidates.

The \u03c4 had candidates with p T > 18 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3 are considered [47,49,50]. Photon candidates, identified by means of requirements on the ECAL energy distribution and its distance to the closest track, must have p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The missing transverse momentum p miss T is defined as the negative vectorial sum of the p T of all the reconstructed PF candidates. Its magnitude is denoted as p miss T . Corrections to jet momenta are propagated to the p miss T calculation, and event filters are used to remove spurious high p miss",
