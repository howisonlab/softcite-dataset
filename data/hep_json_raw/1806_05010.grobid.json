In the field of flavour physics, a number of anomalies have been observed when comparing measurements to the Standard Model (Standard Model (SM)) expectation; from which a coherent and conclusive picture emerges. Those anomalies could, if they persist, point towards certain New Physics (NP) models such as leptoquarks or Z bosons. In this review, we will give a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art of exclusive rare b decays from both experimental and theoretical perspective. We will present the current experimental landscape with a focus of the observed anomalies and discuss potential new physics interpretations.",

These rare decay processes are CKM-, GIM-and loop-suppressed, wherefore potential new physics effects can be large compared to the SM amplitude. Such indirect searches allow to probe NP models at much higher mass scales as are currently accessible through direct searches. In the past, exclusive decays with muons in the final state have been measured extensively by the LHC experiments, most notably by LHCb, as well as the B factories. We review the status of these measurements, discuss their theoretical description in the SM and model-independently in the presence of review Status of rare exclusive B hadron decays in 2018 3 new physics. A special focus is set on the anomalies seen in angular distributions of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and in the branching fraction measurements of all exclusive b \u2192 s + \u2212 decays as well as to the tensions observed in tests of lepton flavour universality in this class of decays.

As a consequence, any FCNC-mediated quark-flavor transitions, such as b \u2192 s, emerge only from virtual loop corrections, in which a W is first emitted and subsequently re-absorbed. The emergence at the loop level naturally suppresses the rate at which these processes occur. In the SM, the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix introduces an additional suppression mechanism that renders b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions very rare. 1 Moreover, descriptions of these rare b decays in the SM are further complicated since they pose a multiscale problem: as weak decays they are mediated through the exchange of W and Z bosons, which are much heavier than the remaining particles (with the exception of the t quark). The use of an Effective Field Theory (EFT) helps our understanding of such multi-scale dynamics. In the following, we will discuss the EFT used for predictions of rare b decays below the electroweak breaking scale \u039b EW 80 GeV. Within the SM, this EFT captures the effects of the t quark as well as the W and Z bosons, which are no-longer dynamical degrees of freedom for scales \u00b5 < \u039b EW .",

Angular observables P 4 (left) and P 5 (right) depending on q 2 for B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays with theory predictions overlaid from DHMV 52 and JC. 58,59 Figures from. 57 angular analysis, and has determined the set of angular observables by employing three different methods: by a maximum likelihood fit, by exploiting the angular principal moments, 60 and in addition the zero-crossing points of S 4,5 and A F B were determined from a fit to the decay amplitudes. 50 The full angular analysis gives access to the correlation matrices, which provide crucial input for global fits to theoretical models. The results of the maximum likelihood and the method of angular principal moments are found to be compatible. As the maximum likelihood yields the most precise results, we restrict the discussion to this approach. However, we note in passing that the angular principal moments allow for smaller bin widths in q 2 and therefore provide more information of the q 2 shape of the angular observables compared to the maximum likelihood method. In this analysis performed by the LHCb collaboration, the fraction of the S-wave component was taken into account. Neglecting theoretical correlations, the S i observables appear to be compatible with the SM predictions. The theory correlations can be displayed best in the space of the P ( ) observables with the most notable deviation of the SM in P 5 as can be seen from Fig. 9: in the regions 4 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 6 GeV 2 /c 4 and 6 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 8 GeV 2 /c 4 , deviations of the measured values from the SM prediction 61 of 2.8\u03c3 and 3.0\u03c3 can be observed, respectively. This confirms the tension seen in a previous LHCb analysis 49 in the region 4.30 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 8.68 GeV 2 /c 4 , which had a local significance of 3.7\u03c3. A fit to the complete set of CP -averaged observables, namely F L , A FB and S 3 \u2212 S 9 , as determined from the maximum likelihood fit is performed by the LHCb collaboration 50 using the EOS software package 62,63 for observables in the q 2 ranges below 8 GeV 2 /c 4 and 15.0 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 19.0 GeV 2 /c 4 . The fit result illustrated in Fig. 10 indicates a tension of 3.4\u03c3 between the measurements and the SM prediction of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 alone.",

A slight excess of \u223c 2\u03c3 is observed in the high q 2 region of the partial branching fraction measurement shown in Fig. 14 for both electron and muon final states. From the branching fractions, which are determined for both electron and muon final states as well as the flavour-averaged combination, the direct CP asymmetry is extracted. By integrating over the q 2 region, the flavour-averaged CP asymmetry is found to be A CP (B \u2192 X s + \u2212 ) = 0.04 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.01, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively, 76 and A CP is consistent with the SM prediction as are the CP asymmetries in bins of q 2 .  A similar analysis was published by the Belle collaboration on its full dataset, in which the first measurement of A FB as a function of q 2 was reported, 77 where the reconstruction of the hadronic system extends over ten final states. The sum-ofexclusive results are compatible with SM predictions as can be seen from Fig. 15. For q 2 > 10.2 GeV 2 /c 4 , A F B < 0 is excluded at a level of 2.3\u03c3. b baryons. Their decay to a ground state \u039b baryons offers a rich phenomenology with ten angular observables in the case of an unpolarised \u039b 0 b baryon. 78 The LHCb collaboration has measured the differential branching fraction of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays along with the forward-backward asymmetries of the dimuon and the p\u03c0 systems denoted by A FB and A h FB , respectively, as well as the fraction of the longitudinally polarised dimuons, f L . 79 The first significance of a signal is reported in the two regions 0.1 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 2.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and between the charmonium resonances in the range 11.0 GeV 2 /c 4 < q 2 < 12.5 GeV 2 /c 4 . The angular observables f L and A FB are extracted from a fit to the one-dimensional angular distributions as a function of cos \u03b8 , which is defined as the angle between the positive (negative) muon and dimuon flight direction in the \u039b 0 b (\u039b 0 b ) rest frame. Similarly, the hadronic forwardbackward asymmetry is determined from the one-dimensional distribution of cos \u03b8 h , where \u03b8 h is the angle between the proton and \u039b directions. The results on A h FB are in good agreement with the SM prediction, whereas the leptonic forward-backward asymmetry lies systematically above the prediction. The results on A FB along with the differential branching fraction are depicted in Fig. 16. The interpretation of these data is challenging and no convincing simultaneous theory explanation of these data and the anomalies in the mesonic modes has been found. 80 For a subset of the angular observables the impact of all dimension-six NP contributions has been worked out in. 82 With the future dataset of the LHCb detector, a novel test of the SM could be carried out by studies of polarised versus unpolarised b \u2192 \u039b + \u2212 decays, 83 where the number of angular observables increases from 10 in the unpolarised case to 34 in the case of a non-zero production polarisation of the \u039b 0 b baryons.",

Here, the prediction of lepton flavour universality (LFU) is probed, i.e. the SM prediction that weak couplings to all lepton flavours are identical. At the current experiments, b \u2192 s + \u2212 decays with electrons and muons in the final state are accessible. For q 2 larger than 1 GeV 2 both muons and electrons are sufficiently relativistic such that uncertainties in the hadronic form factors cancel to a very good approximation leaving a SM prediction with uncertainties well below 1%. 84 Log-enhanced radiative corrections for the decay rates are discussed in 85 yielding a larger uncertainty \u223c 1%. In recent years, the interest in lepton flavour universality tests has increased, mainly driven by two measurements of the LHCb collaboration: the ratio of B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 to B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 , called R(K), 86 and the ratio of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 to B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 , called R(K * ). 87 The LHCb collaboration uses basically the same strategy for both analyses, that is discussed here for general b \u2192 s + \u2212 decays with the corresponding hadron H.

Leptonic rare B 0 (s) \u2192 + \u2212 decays In 1985, the CLEO collaboration published the first limit on B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , whereas UA1 should follow four years later with the first limit in the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channel; the timeline of limits and measurements is shown in Fig. 19 . In recent years, the interest in the decays B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 increased as the SM rate came into experimental reach. The SM prediction for the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is known with a precision better than 5% as discussed in detail in Section 4.3 and lies at B SM (B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = (3.57\u00b1 0.17) \u2022 10 \u22129 . 94 It has to be noted that the experimentally accessible observable is the time integrated branching fraction, which differs from the theoretical branching fraction at t = 0 95 due to B 0 s mixing effects. The B 0 s \u2192 + \u2212 branching fractions discussed in this chapter are all the time integrated quantities. Due to the very small width difference, this effect is negligible for B 0 decays.",

In the tauonic decay channel, the decays of the \u03c4 leptons render the measurement challenging as they involve at least two neutrinos, and hence can only be reconstructed if additional information on the B momentum is available.",

Following 124 and later work, these properties can be incorporated into the parametrization of the form factors by virtue of a conformal mapping from q 2 to a variable z(q 2 ; t + , t 0 ). The mapping automatically accounts for the first cross-channel branch cut when equating t + \u2261 (M B + M K ) 2 . A suitable choice of t 0 minimizes the value of |z| in the physical q 2 phase space for semileptonic decays. 125 The common paradigm 42,123 to parametrize the form factors is then to first remove the subthreshold poles through an explicit factor; and second to expand the remaining functions as a Taylor series around z = 0.

The authors were able to show that all contributions to leading power in a combined expansion of local operators in 1/m b and 1/E, with E the hadron energy in the B rest frame, can be expressed either through local hadronic form factors or convolutions of hard-collinear kernels with B-meson and light-meson LCDAs. Note here that the restriction on the allowed q 2 phase space arises both from the requirements of the power expansion in QCDF, and from estimating a breakdown of the local OPE close to the J/\u03c8 pole. The latter estimate has been questioned more recently in. 142,143 By using a Light-Cone OPE (LCOPE), the authors estimate that formally power-suppressed soft contributions become numerically relevant for q 2 4m 2 c 4 GeV 2 . The leading-power contribution to the LCOPE corresponds to the local OPE such that the QCDF results are completely recovered. At next-toleading power, corrections to the local OPE from operators involving one soft gluon field can be incorporated. The relevant non-local hadronic matrix elements were estimated from LCSRs. The approximate symmetry of the QCDF results between the two transverse polarization states, arising in the limit of large K * energy in the B-meson rest frame, can be exploited phenomenologically. A large number of optimised observables have been designed that exhibit a reduced dependence on the local form factors . 30,[144][145][146] The now standard basis of optimised observables is {P 1,2,3 , P 4,5,6 }. 45 For the phase space with q 2 m 2 b , the four-quark operators can be treated in a local OPE, 35,147 commonly referred to as the Low Recoil OPE (LROPE). Due to the universality of the LROPE results for the various K * and dimuon polarisation states, it gives rise to a rich phenomenology and a set of optimised observables. 23,31,40,52,62,148,149 In contrast to the theory approaches below the J/\u03c8, the LROPE results can only be used for sufficiently inclusive q 2 -integrated quantities. The small size of the available phase space in B \u2192 K ( * ) decays above the open charm threshold bring into question the LROPE predictions (see e.g. 150 ). Possible relief is an item of active research, and includes: an update to the Kr\u00fcger/Sehgal model for the resonances including matching onto the LROPE without 150 and with 151 the use of endpoint relations among the amplitudes; 149 and explicit models for the violation of quark-hadron duality in rare D decays. 152 Rare D decays might be an interesting laboratory to test our understanding of the long-distance effects, due to their larger hierarchy between long-distance and short-distance effects when compared to the rare B decays.",

            "text": "The first question has one definite answer: with larger datasets and more complementary data comes greater confidence in the fit results. In addition, the large number of phase space bins allows to perform consistency checks amongst the data. It has been shown that the constraints from individual experiments are in mutual agreement. 27 Moreover, removing individual q 2 bins from the analysis allows to extensively check the results for stability against mismodelling of the non-local charm effects. These checks indicate that the results for C 9 obtained from subsets of the q 2 bin are mutually compatible, and no explicit q 2 dependence of the result is found. (see e.g. 14,27 ). Beside fitting for only the short-distance information encoded in the WC, it has also been demonstrated that information on the form factors and non-local matrix elements can be inferred alongside the WC. 12,139,160 By fitting an explicit parametrisation of the non-local matrix elements to data, it was shown that the non-local effects can explain the anomalies, but then fail to explain the q 2 behaviour of the non-local effects as imposed by the dispersion relations and require corrections to the leading-power theory results beyond what is naively expected based on power-counting arguments. 15,53 While fits to the mesonic modes B \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are by now part of the standard global fits, the inclusion of the baryonic mode \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b ( * ) + \u2212 is much more complicated and will require future work to be viable. A first study to that effect concluded that exploitation of the data at low hadronic recoil is possible. 80 However, the positive shift to C 9 which emerges in this study is at odds with the consistent picture of a negative shift in all other processes. Moreover, even this positive shift required large duality-violating effects due to non-local charm effects that are incompatible with our present understanding of the LROPE. 80 The second question has no definite answer: no amount of data, neither from present nor from upcoming experiments, will allow to constrain the entire set of WC simultaneously. The common paradigm is to restrict the fits to the WC of operators of mass dimension six. This is a reasonable restriction, since dimension-eight operators are generically suppressed by factors M 2 B /M 2 W \u223c 0.5%.  Fig. 21. Plots of the allowed region in the C 9 -C 10 plane based of four competing analyses. Even though the four analysis use different approaches for the hadronic matrix elements, they all find a substantial tension with respect to the SM value for the parameter C 9 .",

With the upcoming upgrade of the LHCb detector in 2019-2020 and the start of the Belle II experiment later this year, a confirmation or exclusion of those present-day anomalies is to be expected within the next years. The current available datasets of the LHCb and Belle collaboration correspond to integrated luminosities of 6.7 fb \u22121 at the beginning of 2018 and 0.7 ab \u22121 , respectively. The Belle II experiment is expected to collect 5 ab \u22121 (50 ab \u22121 ) by 2020 (2024). With the LHCb detector, an increase to 8 fb \u22121 for this year before the second long shutdown is foreseen. After the scheduled major upgrade of the LHCb detector 164 datasets corresponding to 22 fb \u22121 in 2024 and to 50 fb \u22121 by 2029 will be accumulated. 165 In, 163 the impact of the future sensitivities at those well-defined milestones in 2020, 2024 and 2029 are estimated and their impact on global fits to the Wilson Coefficients is discussed. An illustration of the impact of future sensitivities of the Belle II and LHCb experiments and their complementarity is shown in Fig. 22. As can be seen from Fig. 22, the primed semileptonic operators as well as the electromagnetic dipole operators are currently consistent with the SM hypothesis. However, the current measurements exhibit a tension from the SM in C 9 (see Section 5.1), which",
