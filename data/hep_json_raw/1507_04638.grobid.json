The study is performed using 469 fb \u22121 of data collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e + e \u2212 collider at center-of-mass energies near 10.6 GeV. The form factor is found to decrease with energy faster than 1/E 2 , and approaches the asymptotic QCD prediction. Production of the K + K \u2212 final state through the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) intermediate states is observed. The results for the kaon form factor are used together with data from other experiments to perform a model-independent determination of the relative phases between electromagnetic (singlephoton) and strong amplitudes in J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays. The values of the branching fractions measured in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 are shifted relative to their true values due to interference between resonant and nonresonant amplitudes. The values of these shifts are determined to be about \u00b15% for the J/\u03c8 meson and \u00b115% for the \u03c8(2S) meson.",

At higher energies, there are precise measurements at 3.671 GeV [8], 3.772, and 4.170 GeV [9], and there is a scan that extends to 5 GeV [3]. The energy dependence of these higher-energy data is consistent with the asymptotic form predicted by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), but their magnitude is about a factor of four higher than the predicted asymptotic value [10] ",

This gives good precision near threshold, but the cross section decreases rapidly with increasing energy, limiting that measurement to energies below 5 GeV. In this paper we utilize small-angle (SA) ISR events, in which the ISR photon is emitted close to the e + e \u2212 collision axis, and so is undetected. This allows us to perform an independent and complementary measurement of the charged-kaon form factor, which has better precision in the range 2.6-5 GeV, and extends the measurements up to 8 GeV.",

The M 2 miss interval is extended to negative values to increase the sensitivity to e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 background and thus to better determine its contribution. The distribution for signal events is taken from simulation and is centered at zero. The distribution for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 background is obtained using data events with at least one identified muon, and is shifted to negative M 2 miss values because of the muon-kaon mass difference. We also include the small contributions from ISR and two-photon events estimated as described below in Secs. IV B and IV C.

The resulting K + K \u2212 mass spectra in the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mass regions are shown in Fig. 13. Each of these spectra is fitted with the sum of a signal probability density function (PDF) and a linear background. The signal PDF is a Breit-Wigner (BW) function convolved with a double-Gaussian function describing signal resolution. In each fit, the BW mass and width are fixed to their known values [11] and the nominal resolution parameters are taken from simulation. In order to account for deficiencies in the simulation, a mass shift \u2206M is allowed, and an increase in both Gaussian widths by a term \u03c3 G added in quadrature is introduced. The free parameters in the J/\u03c8 fit are the numbers of signal and background events, the slope of the background function, \u2206M , and \u03c3 G .

They are corrected to correspond to the nominal selection |M 2 miss | < 1 GeV 2 /c 4 as described in Sec. IV A. The first uncertainty in N sig is statistical; the second is systematic due to background subtraction. The value of the ISR luminosity L i is obtained by integrating W (s, x) from Refs.[12,13] over mass interval i and is listed inTable III. The formulas from Refs.[12,13] include higher-order radiative corrections. However, we do not include in W (s, x) corrections for leptonic and hadronic vacuum polarization in the pho-",
