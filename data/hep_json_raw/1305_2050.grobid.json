[25] are the favoured D \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and the suppressed D \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final states. In a similar manner to the twobody GLW/ADS analysis, seven observables are defined as ratios of decay rates. Their relations to \u03b3 and the hadronic parameters are fully analogous and given by Eqs. (10), (14), and (16), with f = K \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 and f sup = \u03c0 K \u03c0\u03c0 . The CP-violating effects are diluted due to the D decay proceeding through a range of resonances that can only interfere in limited regions of the four-body phase space. This dilution is accounted for by multiplying each interference term by a coherence factor \u03ba = \u03ba K 3\u03c0 . The D decay time acceptance and resolution model is identical to that present in the two-body GLW/ADS analysis of Ref. [24]. The seven observables, taken from the four-body analysis reported in Ref. [25], are Statistical correlations of the B \u00b1 \u2192 Dh \u00b1 , D \u2192 K \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 analysis [25].",
