            "text": "Measurements of the production cross section of a Z boson with one or more jets in hadron collisions, hereafter Z \u00fe jets, can be compared with predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). Analyses of data collected during the first run of the CERN LHC have used two main theoretical approaches, developed in the last decade, for the complete description of the associated production of vector bosons and jets up to stable particles in the final state. Multileg matrix elements, computed at leading order (LO) in pQCD, have been combined with parton showers (PS), merging different final jet multiplicities together. Alternatively, next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix elements have been interfaced with parton showers for final states of fixed jet multiplicity. CMS has relied on MADGRAPH [1] and POWHEG-BOX [2][3][4] as main implementations of the former and latter approaches, respectively. In the last few years, novel techniques have been developed in order to merge NLO calculations for several final-state multiplicities in a theoretically consistent way, and interface them with PS, as formerly done for LO matrix elements. This approach may provide a NLO accuracy for a range of complex topologies, overcoming the limitations of fixed order NLO calculations, which cannot in general describe completely inclusive distributions receiving contributions by final states of different jet multiplicity. Furthermore, a description of these final states up to stable particles is possible, since hadronization models can be used in combination with these calculations. The Z \u00fe jets final state provides jet kinematic distributions that are ideal for testing these different options for theoretical predictions.",

Searches for phenomena beyond the standard model may also be sensitive to this process, which plays a particularly important role as the main background in the study of supersymmetric scenarios with large missing transverse momentum. This has been one of the main motivations for a previous analysis of the angular distributions in Z \u00fe jets events presented by CMS [7], and the study presented in this paper is complementing it with the measurement of jet spectra.",

ATLAS has reported an updated measurement at the same center-of-mass energy with a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 [12]. In this paper, we update and expand upon the results obtained by the CMS Collaboration at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 AE 0.1 fb \u22121 [13] collected in 2011. We present fiducial cross sections for Z \u00fe jets production as a function of the exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicity, where the Z bosons are identified through their decays into electron or muon pairs. The contribution from Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 interference is considered to be part of the measured signal. We measure the differential cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum p T and pseudorapidity \u03b7 of the four highest-p T jets in the event. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 \u00bc \u2212 ln tan\u00bd\u03b8=2, where \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the counterclockwise-rotating proton beam. We also present results for the distribution of H T , the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, measured as a function of the inclusive jet multiplicity. The jet p T and \u03b7 differential cross sections are sensitive to higher order QCD corrections. H T is an observable characterizing globally the QCD emission structure of the event, and it is often used as a discriminant variable in searches for supersymmetric scenarios, to which Z \u00fe jets contribute as a background. The measurement of its distribution is therefore of great interest.",

The magnet flux-return yoke is instrumented with gas-ionization tracking devices for muon detection. In addition to the barrel and end cap detectors, CMS has an extensive forward calorimetry system. CMS uses a twolevel trigger system. The first level is composed of custom hardware processors, and uses local information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger is a processor farm that further decreases the event rate from a maximum of 100 kHz to roughly 300 Hz, before data storage.

The inner tracker, which consists of silicon pixel and silicon strip detectors, reconstructs chargedparticle trajectories within the range j\u03b7j < 2.5. The tracking system provides an impact parameter resolution of 15 \u03bcm and a p T resolution of 1.5% for 100 GeV particles. Energy deposits in the ECAL are matched to tracks in the silicon detector and used to initiate the reconstruction algorithm for electrons. The tracking algorithm takes into account the energy lost by electrons in the detector material through bremsstrahlung. In the energy range relevant for Z -boson decays, the electron energy resolution is below 3%. Muon trajectories are reconstructed for j\u03b7j < 2.4 using detector planes based on three technologies: drift tubes, cathodestrip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching outer muon trajectories to tracks measured in the silicon tracker provides an average p T resolution of 1.6% for the p T range used in this analysis. For the jets reconstructed in this analysis, the p T resolution is better than 10% and the energy scale uncertainty is less than 3% [15].",

Simulated Drell-Yan Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 , tt, and W \u00fe jets events are generated using the MADGRAPH 5.1.1 [1] event generator. The package provides a tree level matrix-element calculation with up to four additional partons in the final state for vector boson production, and three additional partons for tt events. The leading-order CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDF) [16] are used with MADGRAPH. The residual QCD radiation, described by a parton shower algorithm, and the hadronization, which turns the partons into a set of stable particles, are implemented with PYTHIA 6.424 [17] using the Z2 underlying event and fragmentation tune [18]. The default \u03b1 S value of the PDF set used is adopted for the event generator. The matrix-element and parton shower calculations are matched using the k T -MLM algorithm [19]. Decays of the \u03c4 lepton are described by the TAUOLA 1.27 [20] package. Diboson events (WW, WZ, ZZ) are modeled entirely with PYTHIA. Single-top events in the Wt channel are simulated using POWHEG-BOX [2][3][4]21], and followed by PYTHIA to describe QCD radiation beyond NLO and hadronization. An alternative description of the Drell-Yan signal is used for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties that is based on the SHERPA 1.4 [22][23][24][25] tree level matrixelement calculation, which has up to four additional partons in the final state, and uses the NLO CTEQ6.6M [26] PDF set.",

The corrections are parametrized in terms of the uncorrected p T and \u03b7 of the jet, and applied as multiplicative factors scaling the four-momentum vector of each jet.

The correction is determined as a function of p T and \u03b7 of the leptons, and background components are resolved using a binned extended maximum-likelihood fit of the dilepton invariant-mass distribution between 60 and 120 GeV. The signal component of the distribution, which is taken from the Drell-Yan simulated sample, is convolved with a Gaussian function to account for the resolution difference between data and simulation.

The error bars on the plotted data points represent the statistical uncertainty, while crosshatched bands represent the total experimental uncertainty (statistical and systematic uncertainties summed in quadrature) after the unfolding procedure. Uncertainties in the theoretical predictions are shown in the ratio of data to simulation only. For the NLO prediction, theoretical uncertainties are evaluated by varying simultaneously the factorization and renormalization scales up and down by a factor of two (for SHERPA and POWHEG). For the SHERPA prediction only, the resummation scale is changed up and down by a factor ffiffi ffi 2 p and the parton shower matching scale is changed by 10 GeV in both directions. The effect of the PDF choice is shown for SHERPA, by comparing the results based on CT10 PDF set with those based on the alternative NLO PDFs MSTW2008 and NNPDF2.1 [56]. The theoretical part of the plotted uncertainty band for each PDF choice includes both the intrinsic PDF uncertainty, evaluated according to the prescriptions of the authors of each PDF set, and the effect of the variation of AE0.002 in the value of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S around the central value used in the PDF. Figure 2 shows the measured cross sections as a function of the exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicities, for a total number of up to six jets in the final state. Beyond the sixth jet, the measurement is not performed due to the statistical limitation of the data and simulated samples. The trend of the jet multiplicity represents the expectation of the pQCD prediction for a staircaselike scaling, with an approximately constant ratio between cross sections for successive multiplicities [57]. This result confirms the previous observation, which was based on a more statistically limited sample [11]. Within the uncertainties, there is agreement between theory and measurement for both the inclusive and the exclusive distributions.",

The pQCD prediction by MADGRAPH provides a satisfactory description of data for most distributions, but shows an excess in the p T spectra for the first and second leading jets at p T > 100 GeV. SHERPA tends to underestimate the high p T and H T regions in most of the spectra, while remaining compatible with the measurement within the estimated theoretical uncertainty. POWHEG predicts harder p T spectra than those observed in the data for the events with two or more jets, where the additional hard radiation is described by the parton showers and not by matrix elements. This discrepancy is also reflected in the H T distribution. Figures 6-9 show no significant dependence of the level of agreement between data and the SHERPA prediction on the PDF set chosen.
