The J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons are reconstructed in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay mode and the signal yields are determined with a fit to the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass distributions. The analysis is performed in the rapidity range 2.0 < y < 4.5 and transverse momentum range 0 < p T < 14 (15) GeV/c of the J/\u03c8 (\u03a5 ) mesons. The J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 production crosssections and the fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons from b-hadron decays are measured as a function of the meson p T and y.",

            "text": "Successfully describing heavy quarkonium production is a long-standing problem in QCD. An effective field theory, non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1,2], provides the foundation for much of the current theoretical work. According to NRQCD, the production of heavy quarkonium factorises into two steps: a heavy quark-antiquark pair is first created at short distances and subsequently evolves non-perturbatively into quarkonium at long distances. The NRQCD calculations depend on the colour-singlet (CS) and colour-octet (CO) matrix elements, which account for the probability of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in a particular colour state to evolve into a heavy quarkonium state. The CS model (CSM) [3,4], which provides a leading-order description of quarkonium production, was initially used to describe experimental data. However, it underestimates the observed cross-section for single J/\u03c8 production at high transverse momentum (p T ) at the Tevatron [5]. To resolve this discrepancy, the CO mechanism was introduced [6]. The corresponding matrix elements were determined from the high-p T data, as the CO cross-section decreases more slowly with p T than that predicted by CS. More recent higher-order calculations [7][8][9][10] close the gap between the CS predictions and the experimental data [11], reducing the need for large CO contributions.",

The prompt component of the signal function and that from b hadron decays are convolved with a resolution function modelled by the sum of two Gaussian functions. The background distribution is parameterised with an empirical function based on the shape of the t z distribution observed in the J/\u03c8 mass sidebands.

This function is convolved with a resolution function modelled by the sum of two Gaussian functions. All parameters of the background component are determined independently in each (p T , y) bin from the distribution of the pseudo decay time and are fixed in the final fit.

The peak values of the \u03a5 (1S), \u03a5 (2S) and \u03a5 (3S) mass distributions are allowed to vary in the fit and are consistent with the known values [28].

The J/\u03c8 polarisation has been measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV JHEP06(2013)064 by the LHCb [42] and ALICE [43] collaborations, in a kinematic range similar to that used in this analysis, and the \u03a5 polarisation has been measured by CMS [44] at large p T and central rapidity. They were both found to be small. Therefore, in this paper results are quoted under the assumption of zero polarisation and no corresponding systematic uncertainty is assigned on the cross-section for this effect. All other systematic uncertainties are summarised in table 2. Uncertainties related to the mass model describing the shape of the dimuon mass distribution are estimated by fitting the invariant mass distributions for the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons with the sum of two Crystal Ball functions. The relative difference in the number of signal events (0.7-2.2%) is taken as a systematic uncertainty. A fraction of events has a lower invariant mass because of the energy lost through bremsstrahlung. Based on simulation studies, about 4% of the signal events are estimated to be outside the analysis JHEP06(2013)064 mass windows and are not counted as signal. The fitted signal yields are corrected for this effect and an uncertainty of 1% is assigned to the cross-section measurement based on a comparison between the radiative tail observed in data and simulation.",

This model predicts the b-quark production crosssection, and includes the fragmentation of the b-quark into b-hadrons and their decay into J/\u03c8 mesons. In figure 10 the data for the differential production cross-section as a function of p T and y at \u221a s = 8 TeV are compared to the FONLL predictions. Good agreement is observed. The prediction for the total cross-section in the fiducial range of this measurement is 1.  Figure 9. Comparison of the differential cross-section for the production of prompt J/\u03c8 meson (under the assumption of zero polarisation) as a function of p T with direct production in an NLO NRQCD model [47,48] (orange diagonal shading), an NNLO* CSM [10] (solid yellow) and an NLO CSM [7] (blue vertical shading). The points show the measurements reported in this analysis. that this model can produce reliable predictions for the b-hadron cross-section at the higher energies expected at the LHC.",
