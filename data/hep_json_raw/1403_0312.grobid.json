            "text": "Introduction Positronium (Ps) [1][2][3] is a bound state of an electron and a positron. Ground-state positronium has two spin eigenstates: ortho-positronium (o-Ps, spin = 1, 3\u03b3 -decay, lifetime = 142 ns [4][5][6][7]) and para-positronium (p-Ps, spin = 0, 2\u03b3 -decay, lifetime = 125 ps [8]). The energy level of o-Ps is higher than that of p-Ps by the hyperfine structure ( Ps HFS ). Compared with the hyperfine structure of hydrogen (about 1.4 GHz), Ps HFS is very large, about 203 GHz (wavelength = 1.5 mm), due to light mass of Ps and an s-channel contribution (87 GHz). Since the transition from o-Ps to p-Ps is forbidden, high-power (over 10 kW) millimeter-wave radiation is required to measure the resonance around the hyperfine structure. Many technological difficulties regarding the use of millimeter waves have prevented direct measurement of this resonance. Measurements using the Zeeman effect in a static magnetic field (\u223c1 T) have been intensively studied instead of direct measurements. However, it is highly desirable to directly examine the Breit-Wigner resonance from free o-Ps to p-Ps because the properties of Ps are derived in a fundamental way by quantum electrodynamics without any external fields.",

The power of the output beam was thus stabilized to within \u223c10% during each measurement (lasting a few days). The frequency of the gyrotron is tuned between 201 GHz and 205 GHz by using gyrotron cavities of different radii (R 0 ). The values of the frequency and cavity radius are summarized in Table 1. A far off-resonance point (180.56 GHz) is obtained by using a different operating mode (TE 42 mode). When a cavity of 2.467 mm was used, we changed the strength of the gyrotron's magnetic field so that the oscillation frequency moved within the Q-value of the cavity. The frequency is precisely measured (\u00b11 kHz) using a heterodyne detector (Virginia Diodes Inc., WR5.1 even harmonic mixer).

Thanks to this high effective power, we can obtain enough signals of the transition from o-Ps to p-Ps to determine the resonance shape. One disadvantage of the silicon is severe interference of millimeter waves between the mesh mirror and the silicon plate due to its high refractive index (3.45). In order to reduce this effect, CST Microwave Studio [14] is used to simulate the interference and to optimize the structure of the mesh mirror.

            "text": "Positronium is formed in the gas chamber in which the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity is placed (Fig. 1). A positron emitted from a 22 Na source (1 MBq) is tagged by a thin plastic scintillator (thickness = 0.1 mm, NE-102 equivalent), and the \u03b3 rays produced in its annihilation are detected by four LaBr 3 (Ce) crystals. The time spectrum of Ps is obtained as the time difference between the positron and \u03b3 -ray signals. Photomultipliers (HAMAMATSU R5924-70) are used to detect optical photons from the scintillators, and charge-sensitive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used to measure the energy. The temperature of the chamber is maintained at less than 30 \u2022 C using water cooling.  There has been a long-standing problem of an increasing ratio of Ps production in gas when irradiated by electromagnetic waves. It was first reported by Ref. [16], and was studied in a static electric field using the Boltzmann equation [17,18]. We have also observed the same phenomenon using millimeter waves [12]. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we measured the time spectra of o-Ps and slow positrons (positrons with energies below the threshold for Ps production [19,20]) in pure N 2 . The spectra in N 2 shown in Fig. 3(a) clearly demonstrate the increase of o-Ps and decrease of slow positrons. This phenomenon is due to a slow positron accelerated by the strong millimeterwave fields [21]. The accelerated slow positrons collide randomly with gas molecules with a rate comparable to 203 GHz and finally exceed the threshold of Ps production (the Ore gap). Figure 3(b) shows that an increasing ratio of Ps is almost proportional to the stored power. This phenomenon does not strongly depend on frequency and causes fake signals at off-resonance points; therefore, it would distort the Breit-Wigner resonance by the level of a few %.",

            "text": "The cause of this phenomenon is an elastic scattering of slow positrons with N 2 gas molecules. The target gas is required to have many vibrational and rotational modes because its cross-section of inelastic scattering is large and drastically decelerates the accelerated slow positrons, as indicated in Refs. [17,18]. We selected pure neopentane (C-(CH 3 ) 4 ) gas (25 \u2022 , 1 atm), which has many more internal degrees of freedom than N 2 . No increase of o-Ps in neopentane (Fig. 3(b)) justifies our hypothesis. The use of neopentane also provides high stopping power and efficient Ps production. Furthermore, neopentane does not absorb millimeter waves, unlike isobutane (mixed with N 2 in Ref. [12]), which has an absorption line at 202.5 GHz [22,23]. To confirm that the use of neopentane definitely eliminates the problem in Ps production, a far off-resonance point (180.56 GHz) was measured.  Analysis To enhance o-Ps events, we require that the time difference between the plastic scintillator signal and the coincidence signal of the LaBr 3 (Ce) detectors is between 50 ns and 250 ns. Pileup events, in which two different positrons signal the plastic scintillator, are reduced by requiring that the charges measured by long (1000 ns) and short (60 ns) gate ADCs are consistent. The number of accidental coincidences is estimated using a time window between 850 ns and 900 ns, and is subtracted from the signal sample. We also apply an energy selection, between 494 keV and 536 keV, to select the two back-to-back \u03b3 rays. Figure 4 shows the measured time spectra at a frequency of 203.51 GHz and accumulated power of 67.4 kW. Data are shown separately for events in beam-ON or beam-OFF of gyrotron pulses. The beam-OFF spectrum consists of pick-off annihilation (quenching by an electron in a gas molecule [24]) and 3\u03b3 -decays of o-Ps. The lifetime shortened by the transition from o-Ps to p-Ps (\u03c4 OFF = 131.3 \u00b1 2.7 ns \u2192 \u03c4 ON = 108.2 \u00b1 3.1 ns) is observed as shown in Fig. 4. This decrease in lifetime is consistent with the theoretical prediction, and results in an enhancement of the event rate during the beam-ON period. The event rates in beam-ON and beam-OFF periods are R ON = 548 mHz and R OFF = 455 mHz, respectively.",

This ratio is nothing but the pick-off annihilation probability of beam-OFF events, given by fitting the time spectra. The lifetime of o-Ps decreases from 142 ns to approximately 131 ns due to this effect (the pick-off annihilation probability is about 8%).

            "text": "Discussion In this paper, we first demonstrate that Ps HFS can be directly determined with millimeter-wave spectroscopy. A conventional method uses Zeeman-shifted levels caused by a static magnetic field. In a static magnetic field (\u223c1 T), one of the o-Ps states is mixed with p-Ps and the energy level of the mixed o-Ps state rises by about 3 GHz compared with the original state. This Zeeman splitting can be precisely measured by an radio frequency, being scanned by strength of magnetic field. The value of Ps HFS is calculated via the Breit-Rabi formula [39,40]. In the 1970s and 1980s, measurements with the Zeeman effect reached accuracies at ppm level [26,27]. It should be noted that the obtained Ps HFS significantly differs by 13 ppm from theoretical predictions calculated in the 2000s [31][32][33][34][35]. This may be due to underestimated systematic errors in the previous measurement. For example, non-uniformity of the static magnetic field is a candidate for systematic uncertainty. Some independent experiments (using quantum interference [41][42][43][44], optical lasers [45], and a new method using a precise magnetic field [30]) have been performed. All of them are measurements using Zeeman intervals. It is of great importance to re-measure Ps HFS using a method totally different from the previous experiments. Determination of Ps HFS by directly measuring the transition from free o-Ps to p-Ps is a complementary approach to the measurements using the Zeeman effect.",

The statistical error becomes smaller than 10 ppm. (2) Positronium will be formed in vacuum using an efficient Ps converter (conversion efficiency is around 20-50% [47][48][49]). The Stark effect (460 ppm at 1 atm) and non-thermalization effect of Ps (about 10-20 ppm) can be eliminated. Since there is no pick-off annihilation in vacuum, S/N will also be improved significantly by a factor of two. (3) Using a megawatt (MW) class gyrotron [50,51] would enable us to precisely (better than 0.3%) monitor the real power with a calorimeter. The present accuracy (20%) of the power estimation is mainly limited by uncertainty of the effective power in the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity. The systematic error due to the power can be better than 10 ppm.",

(b) Power dependence of the increasing ratio of o-Ps in N 2 gas and neopentane. The solid line shows a linear fit for the o-Ps data, the dashed line does the same for neopentane. The origin of the neopentane data is defined as zero due to the lack of data at low power.",
