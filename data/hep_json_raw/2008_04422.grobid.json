The analyzed proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 , were recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search utilizes the substructure of jets with large radius to identify quark pairs from Z boson decays. Backgrounds from standard model processes are suppressed by requirements on the jet mass and the missing transverse momentum. No significant excess in the event yield is observed beyond the number of background events expected from the standard model. For a simplified supersymmetric model in which the Z bosons arise from the decay of gluinos, an exclusion limit of 1920 GeV on the gluino mass is set at 95% confidence level. This is the first search for beyond-standardmodel production of pairs of boosted Z bosons plus large missing transverse momentum.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [1][2][3] at the CERN LHC fulfilled the predicted particle content of the standard model (SM). However, within the SM as a quantum field theory, the measured Higgs boson mass of around 125 GeV presents a special challenge as the calculated mass is unstable against corrections from loop processes when the theory is extended to higher mass scales. In the absence of extreme fine tuning [4][5][6][7] that would precisely cancel the divergent terms, the mass value can run up to the ultraviolet cutoff of the model at the Planck scale. This instability of the Higgs boson mass and the entire electroweak scale is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. One widely studied extension of the SM is supersymmetry (SUSY) [8][9][10], which posits a partner for each SM particle differing in spin by one-half unit. For example, squarks q and gluinos g are the SUSY partners of quarks and gluons, respectively. Depending on the mass hierarchy of these new particles, they could resolve the gauge hierarchy problem by providing necessary radiative corrections to partly cancel the SM contributions. Furthermore, in R-parity conserving models [11,12], SUSY particles are produced in pairs, while the lightest of them is neutral, stable, and weakly interacting.

            "text": "(LSP) provides a suitable candidate for dark matter [12], which is not described in the SM. The typical experimental signatures of pair-produced SUSY particles with R-parity conserving decay chains are jets, leptons, and large missing transverse momentum (p miss T ). As gluinos and squarks carry color charge, like their SM partners, they can be produced via the strong interaction; therefore among SUSY particles they have the highest production cross sections at hadron colliders for a given mass. Searches for direct decays of gluinos to quarks and the LSP have excluded m( g ) 2 TeV [13][14][15][16], depending on the model. The search described in this paper focuses on gluino decay cascades to Z bosons and the LSP via the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP). We consider a picture in which the NLSP and LSP are respectively the neutralinos \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 , mixed states of SUSY partners of the neutral Higgs and gauge bosons. Such a situation arises in SUSY scenarios like those described in ref. [17] that seek to preserve \"naturalness,\" that is, minimal fine tuning of the SM to solve the gauge hierarchy problem, by admitting large mass splittings among the neutralinos (and charginos), leading to experimental signatures with vector bosons and p miss T in the final state. Figure 1 shows our signal process, expressed within the framework of simplified models [18][19][20][21], and referred to as T5ZZ. We further assume a heavy \u03c7 0 2 , (with mass below that of the g ), and a light \u03c7 0",

The isolation criterion is based on a variable I, which is the scalar p T sum of charged hadron, neutral hadron, and photon PF candidates within a cone of radius \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 around the lepton direction, divided by the lepton p T . The expected contributions of neutral particles from pileup are subtracted [64,66]. The radius of the cone, in radians, is 0.2 for lepton p T < 50 GeV, 10 GeV/p T for 50 \u2264 p T \u2264 200 GeV, and 0.05 for p T > 200 GeV. The decrease in cone size with increasing lepton p T accounts for the increased collimation of the decay products from the lepton's parent particle as the Lorentz boost of the latter increases [72]. The isolation requirement is I < 0.1 (0.2) for electrons (muons).",

The same offline criteria are also applied, with the exception that the p miss T requirement is relaxed to 200 GeV to gain a longer lever arm for the p miss T shape comparison, and the lepton vetoes are applied only after selecting exactly one electron or muon. Figure 7 shows the p miss T shape comparison for the photon and single-lepton data. Both ratios are consistent with being independent of p miss T , as expected from the MC closure test, albeit within the limited statistical precision of the data. To account for possible shape differences between the search and control regions, we apply a systematic uncertainty in the p miss T shape calculated using the photon and single-lepton samples. The uncertainty is the difference with respect to a uniform distribution of a fit to the SR/CR distribution with a linear function having a free slope parameter. This results in uncertainties ranging from 0-33% in the Z+jets background based on the photon validation sample, and 1-14% in the combined tt and W+jets background based on the single-lepton validation sample. Weighting these by the proportions of those components in the total background yields uncertainties of 2-30%, depending on the p miss distributions f data (p miss T ) in the two regions, while the lower panels show the ratio of the number of events in the search region to that in the control region. A fit to a constant is included in the lower panels to show the average ratio. The horizontal bars on the markers indicate the widths of the search bins. In the lower panel the statistical uncertainties in the search and control region yields are denoted by the shading and vertical bars, respectively.",

The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 . The signature for a Z boson candidate is a wide-cone jet having a measured mass compatible with the Z boson mass. Yields from standard model background processes, which are small for events with the largest transverse momentum imbalance, are estimated from the data in JHEP09(2020)149 jet mass sidebands. No evidence for physics beyond the standard model is observed. The reach of the search is interpreted in a simplified supersymmetric model of gluino pair production in which each gluino decays to a low-momentum quark pair and the next-tolightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), and the latter decays to a Z boson and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). With the further assumption of a large mass splitting between the NLSP and LSP, the data exclude gluino masses below 1920 GeV at 95% confidence level. This is the first search for beyond-standard-model production of pairs of boosted Z bosons plus large missing transverse momentum.",

The observed (expected) gluino mass limits reach as high as 1920 (2060) GeV. The observed limit is 1.4 standard deviations weaker than the expected one due to the mild excesses observed in the two highest p miss T bins. The sensitivity of the search is independent of m( \u03c7 0 1 ) values that are small compared with m( \u03c7 0 2 ), and of m( \u03c7 0 2 ) values large enough to ensure Lorentz-boosted Z boson daughters.
