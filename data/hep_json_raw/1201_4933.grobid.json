Within the large theoretical uncertainties, NLO QCD predictions are seen to be consistent with the data, the uncertainty on which is dominated by the statistical error.   The inclusive lifetime measurement gives the average lifetime of the admixture of B-hadrons produced at the LHC and decaying to final states including a J/\u03c8. As discussed above, J/\u03c8 mesons produced from the decays of B-hadrons are non-prompt, having a displaced decay vertex due to the B-hadron lifetime. The average B-lifetime is thus extracted from the data by performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit simultaneously to the J/\u03c8 invariant mass and the pseudo-proper decay time. In order to extract the real lifetime of the B-hadrons, which are not fully reconstructed, a correction for the smearing introduced by the use of the pseudo-proper decay time in the fit is required. This correction (\"F-factor\") is obtained from Monte Carlo, with the J/\u03c8 spectrum in B-hadron decays re-weighted to match BaBar data.
