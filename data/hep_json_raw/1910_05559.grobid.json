We have performed this analysis using two independent techniques; a vectoral analysis of the vector graphics files and a bitmap analysis of the raster graphic files of the exclusion plots from various physics searches. In both procedures, the aim is to compute the percentages of the data points scattered within 1-sigma and 2-sigma bands of the plots and verify whether the measured percentages agree with statistical norms assuming unbiased estimations of the uncertainties.",

While many of these publications are on measurements of the Standard Model and the Higgs Boson, a large fraction relates to searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), mainly supersymmetry and other exotic models. None of those searches have yet yielded positive results, but provided constraints on the masses of hypothetical particles, their production cross-sections, and the coupling constants amongst them.",

The extraction of these limits are quite often a major portion of the analysis as they require a good deal of statistical modelling and a detailed understanding of the behaviour of the detectors. As such, the LHC collaborations form subgroups to set policies regarding which statistical analysis libraries to use and regarding handling of a myriad of different systematic uncertainties from a multitude of sub-detectors.",

Are the statistical analysis libraries indeed bug-free? Do the various assumptions underlying the statistical techniques hold? For example, how reliable are the \"asymptotic approximations\" used in many of these analyses [1]? (See for instance the comparison of exclusion limits derived from ensemble tests vs. asymptotic formulae in Figure 7 of [2].) In general, biased estimations can lead to premature rejection of theoretical models or inflate the significance of statistical Sevim A\u00e7\u0131ks\u00f6z, Bilal \u00c7 ark, Selim Mert K\u0131rp\u0131c\u0131, and Veysi Erkcan\u00d6zcan. In this work, we present the preliminary results of a meta-analysis of 56 articles (Table 1), mostly on exotic BSM physics, from ATLAS and CMS Collaborations published between 2016 and 2018. Our analysis is conducted through two independent methods in order to minimize the possibility of introducing any unintentional biases ourselves. We re-digitize 141 ATLAS and 117 CMS exclusion plots, either in vector graphics form or in the form of bitmaps and then extract the percentages of the observed data points scattered within 1\u03c3 (green) and 2\u03c3 (yellow) uncertainty bands. We find that while the fraction of points falling into the 2\u03c3 band is consistent with 95%, the fraction is higher than 68% for the 1\u03c3 band, particularly for the CMS plots.",

The observed limit is commonly plotted with a dark (black or dark blue) solid curve, and in the mass vs. cross-section plots it divides the parameter space into two regions with the above region excluded.

It is worth noting that quite often the curves are not smooth, with visible kinks at a number of locations. The reason for this is the way the analyses are conducted: during the production of Monte Carlo signal samples, a finite number of mass (or other model parameter) values are picked for the searched-for hypothetical particle, the cross-section limits are extracted for those discrete samples, and the final exclusion curves are constructed by extrapolation (so they are really piecewise linear functions). Our vector-graphics analysis focuses only on the data points at those kinks, while the bitmap analysis runs on all the pixels making up the exclusion curves.

After extracting the paths for the boundaries of the 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 bands and the paths for the observed exclusion data points (Figure 1), the rest of the analysis reduces down to comparison of y-coordinates of the data points with those of the color boundaries in order to decide where each data point lands: 1\u03c3/2\u03c3 regions or beyond. The coordinate information is extracted from the path properties. There is no matching point on the sigma bands for every point on the experimental data line so only the points which have matching counterparts on the three curves are taken into consideration.",

In the publications, the collaborations occasionally show exclusion plots obtained from one particular set of data, but interpreted for modified versions of the signal Monte Carlo samples. (A good example is 1606.03833, which contains multiple copies of Figure 1 prepared for various different values of the decay width of resonance X.)

After this treatment, the effective count of data points is roughly halved. The cumulative results of the vector analysis can be found in Table 3. While the fraction of points within the 2\u03c3 region is consistent with 95% for both experiments, the 1\u03c3 results are somewhat higher than 68%.

As a very striking example, both of 1606.03977 and 1706.04786 are ATLAS searches for W \u2032 candidates in final states with a charged lepton and missing transverse momentum. The latter paper appears to describe the same kind of analysis as the former but run on a superset of the data. Our default treatment is to neglect all cross-paper correlations, since either the amount of data, or the generated Monte Carlo samples, or the analysis technique, or the list of specific final states vary significantly enough to keep the correlations weak. While we believe this is mostly justified, we have also implemented an alternative treatment: Using python, we extract \"refers-to\" lists for each of the analysed publications from arXiv.org and create network maps that display which of a given experiment's publications cites any other publication of that experiment in our list. Most publications are singletons in the map, but some produce small clusters. Then we repeat our metaanalysis either by averaging of results for members of each cluster, or by removing publications from our list until the maps consist of singleton papers only. The second method removes 4 CMS and 8 ATLAS publications, but we are still left with over 5000 data points for each experiment. The final results obtained either way are compatible with the results reported in Table 3.",

As the LHC collaborations use one set of Monte Carlo background events for all the different values of a given signal's paramaters (like a new particle's mass) and since those parameters have resolutions possibly larger than inter-point separations in the plots, the closeby data points on each plot are likely to be somewhat correlated. We intend to carefully model such correlations in a future publication. Yet, as a quick self-test, we have repeated the analysis by randomly picking no more than 3 data points per plot, with each point located far from each other to keep the correlations negligible. The results are again compatible with those reported in Table 3, but with much larger uncertainties due to limited statistics. Such an analysis will become more interesting as we include more papers and plots in the future.",
