We derived constraints on neutrino nonstardard interaction couplings depending on modelindependent approaches which are described by a four-Fermi pointlike interaction and unparticle physics model with tensorial components. Data on\u03bde \u2212 e and \u03bde \u2212 e scattering from the TEXONO and LSND experiments, respectively, are used. The upper limits and the allowed regions of scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensorial nonstandard interaction couplings of neutrinos are derived at 90% confidence level in both one-parameter and two-parameter analysis. New upper limits for tensorial unparticle physics coupling constants and mass parameters are also placed.",

There are intense experimental efforts to study their properties and interactions with matter. Therefore, they are keystones for completeness of the Standard Model (SM) [1]. Solar and atmospheric experimental data have confirmed that neutrinos do oscillate, thereby they are massive and can be mixed. Extra new interactions due to nonstandard properties of neutrinos which are often called nonstandard interactions (NSIs) of a neutrino have not been observed experimentally yet, mainly due to poor experimental sensitivities.",

Nonoscillation experiments that have measured a neutrino cross section with high accuracy may provide profound information for neutrino interactions resulting in direct measurements of NSIs. These interactions are important not only for phenomenological [4] but also for the experimental points of view since the measurements and found evidence can suggest new physics or favor one of the existing new physics theories beyond the SM (BSM).",

NSI of neutrinos is first considered as an alternative mechanism for neutrino oscillation. However, NSI is now only allowed for lower pioneers effects to the neutrino oscillation and can be used to improve the sensitivities of oscillation experiments. In this paper, investigation of some of the BSM new physics scenarios via \u03bd e (\u03bd e )\u2212e elastic scattering is introduced and the results will be given in subsequent sections. In these new physics scenarios, the NSI of neutrinos is considered as a model-independent interaction, which is described as a four-Fermi pointlike or so called zero-distance interaction. Feynman diagram of different NSI for neutrino-electron scattering is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Both neutrino oscillation and non-oscillation experiments are sensitive to NSI parameters and can give complementary results. Non-oscillation neutrino experiments provide direct measurement of NSI while neutrino oscillation experiments are more sensitive to propagation of NSI parameters due to matter effects [4]. NSI can simply be considered as a modification of chiral coupling constants of g L,R with additional new physics terms, in general.",
