Sensitivity to this parameter can be obtained by measuring CP-violating and associated observables in the decay B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 , where D indicates a neutral charm meson reconstructed in final states common to both D 0 and D 0 , of which K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 are significant examples [1,2]. A straightforward approach to such an analysis is to reconstruct the four-body D-meson decays inclusively, which was performed by the LHCb collaboration in a recent measurement [3]. Alternatively, additional sensitivity can be sought by studying the variation of the observables across the phase space of the D decays, a strategy that requires knowledge of the variation of the decay amplitudes of the charm mesons.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors.

The complexvalued vector function,P, has one component for each of the coupled channels, and describes the coupling between the initial state and either one of the poles or a direct coupling to one of these channels. The generic P-vector for the isoscalar K-matrix therefore has 10 complex parameters. An additional complexity in the four-body case is that there are several initial states that couple to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave, each of which has its own P vector. Several simplifying assumptions are therefore made to the P vector to avoid introducing an unreasonable number of degrees of freedom. The only direct production terms included in the P vector are to the \u03c0\u03c0 and K K states, as the production of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state via a direct coupling to another channel all have similar structure below their corresponding production thresholds. The couplings to poles 3, 4 and 5 (where the numbering of the poles is defined in Ref. [29]) are also fixed to zero, as production of these poles only has a small effect within the phase space. This choice reduces the number of free parameters per S-wave production mechanism to four complex numbers. The couplings to the poles are described by \u03b2 0 and \u03b2 1 , while the direct couplings to each channel by f \u03c0\u03c0 and f K K . The production vectors used here should therefore be considered as a minimal simplified model. For production of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave states via resonances, such as the decay chain a 1 (1260) + \u2192 [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] L=0 \u03c0 + , improved sensitivity to the structure of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 state can be achieved by studying a decay mode that produces the a 1 (1260) + with a larger phase space. In several cases, one or more of these couplings are found to be negligible for a given production mode, and therefore are fixed to zero. The K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 S-wave is modelled using the K matrices from the analysis of D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + by the FOCUS collaboration [28]. The I = 1/2 K matrix considers two channels, K \u03c0 and K \u03b7 , and a single pole which is responsible for generating the K * (1430) 0 resonance. Additionally, the K matrix includes polynomial terms that describe nonresonant scattering between the hadrons. The K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 S-wave also contains a I = 3/2 component. No poles or inelasticity are expected with this isospin, and therefore the associated amplitude can be modelled using a K matrix consisting of a single scalar term.",

All parameters in the fit have a systematic uncertainty originating from the limited size of the integration sample used in the likelihood minimisation. This effect is reduced by importance sampling. The remaining uncertainty is estimated using a resampling technique. Half of the integration sample is randomly selected, and the fit performed using only this subsample. This procedure is repeated many times, and the systematic uncertainty from the finite integration statistics is taken to be 1/ \u221a 2 of the spread in fit parameters. There is an additional systematic uncertainty due to the imperfect simulation, which affects the efficiency corrections. The RS data are divided into bins in the D 0 transverse momentum, in which the efficiency corrections may be expected to vary, and the fit is performed independently in each bin. The results of these fits are combined in an uncertainty-weighted average, including the correlations between the different parameters, and the absolute difference between the parameters measured by this procedure and the usual fitting procedure is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. Additionally, the data is divided by data-taking year and software trigger category and independent fits performed using these subsamples. The fit results are found to be compatible within the assigned uncertainties between these samples, hence no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned.",

In the RS decay, the axial kaons are not produced by the external weak current, and hence there is no reason to expect either quark state to be preferred.
