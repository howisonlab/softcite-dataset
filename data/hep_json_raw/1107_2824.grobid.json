            "text": "After the J/\u03c8 discovery, a search for other narrow resonances was performed in several experiments. The energy range between J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons was explored with MARK-1 at SPEAR [1], LENA at DORIS [2], and MD-1 at VEPP-4 [3]. The upper limit on the leptonic width of narrow resonances obtained in these analyses varied between 15 and 970 eV depending on energy. Searches in the energy range below J/\u03c8 mass and down to 1.42 GeV were performed only in experiments at ADONE [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] with upper limits of about 500 eV. Recently the latter energy region was revisited by the KEDR collaboration [11] in view of a discovery of unexpected exotic states above the charm threshold, including the narrow X(3872) state, which proved that surprises are still possible even at low energies [12]. This paper reports results of a search for narrow resonances in e + e \u2212 annihilation in the center-of-mass (c.m.) energy range 1.85-3.1 GeV. The experiment was performed at the VEPP-4M e + e \u2212 collider in Novosibirsk in 2009 and 2010.",

The accuracy of VEPP-4M energy determination with resonant depolarization reaches \u224310 keV in the J/\u03c8 region [15]. However, such measurement is time-consuming and requires dedicated calibration runs without data taking. A new technique developed at the BESSY-I and BESSY-II synchrotron radiation sources [16,17] was adopted for VEPP-4M in 2005. It employs the infrared light Compton backscattering and has worse precision compared to the resonant depolarization (50\u00f770 keV in the J/\u03c8 region), but unlike the latter can be used during data taking [14].",
