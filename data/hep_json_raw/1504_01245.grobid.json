The data were accumulated at the center-of-mass energy of 957.78 \u00b1 0.06 MeV with an integrated luminosity of about 2.9 pb \u22121 . For reconstruction of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson five decay chains have been used: \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 followed by the \u03b7 decays to \u03b3\u03b3 and 3\u03c0 0 , and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 followed by the \u03b7 decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , \u03b3\u03b3, and 3\u03c0 0 . As a result, the upper limit has been set on the \u03b7 \u2032 electronic width: \u0393 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192e + e \u2212 < 0.0020 eV at the 90% confidence level.",

            "text": "This article is devoted to a search for the rare leptonic decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . In the Standard model this decay proceeds through the two-photon intermediate state ( Fig. 1) and, therefore, is suppressed as \u03b1 2 relative to the \u03b7 \u2032 two-photon decay. An additional suppression of (m e /m \u2032 \u03b7 ) 2 arises from helicity conservation. The imaginary part of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay amplitude can be expressed in terms of the known two-photon width \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3). Neglecting the real part of the amplitude one can obtain the model-independent lower limit (unitary limit) on the decay probability B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) > 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u221211 [1]. Calculation of the real part requires knowledge of the transition form factor F (q 2 1 , q 2 2 ) for the \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 vertex, where q 2 1 and q 2 2 are the photon virtualities in the loop. The real part may increase the decay probability by a factor of 3-5 as compared with the unitary limit [2,3]. Due to the small probability, the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay may be sensitive to contributions not described by the Standard Model [4,5].",

            "text": "The dominant sources of background for this decay mode after applying the selection criteria are the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The number of background events is estimated using MC simulation to be 0.7\u00b10.1 and 0.10\u00b10.05 for the first and second processes, respectively. The values of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 cross sections were taken from the measurements [13][14][15]. The background can be also estimated from the two-dimensional distribution shown in Fig. 3 using the assumption that the \u03c7 2 \u03b7 and E 2+3,char distribution are independent. The number of background events in the signal rectangle (\u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 30, E 2+3,char < 60 MeV) is estimated as n 2 n 3 /n 4 \u2248 1 \u00b1 1, where n 2 , n 3 and n 4 are the numbers of data events in the regions (30 < \u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 60, E 2+3,char < 60 MeV), (\u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 30, E 2+3,char > 60 MeV) and (30 < \u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 60, E 2+3,char > 60 MeV), respectively. There is also the nonresonant reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 having the same final state as the process under study. This reaction proceeds through the \u03c1\u03b7 intermediate state and, therefore, is suppressed due to the small phase space of the final particles. Interpolating the result of the fit to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 cross section measured at higher energies [12], we estimate that the nonresonant cross section at E cm = 960 MeV is about 1.7 pb. Assuming the same detection efficiencies for the resonant and nonresonant processes, the nonresonant contribution is estimated to be 0.2 events.",
