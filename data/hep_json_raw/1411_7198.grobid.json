The inclusive branching fraction for M X s < 2.8 GeV=c 2 , which corresponds to a minimum photon energy of 1.9 GeV, is measured to be B\u00f0B \u2192 X s \u03b3\u00de \u00bc \u00f03.51 AE 0.17 AE 0.33\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.",

            "text": "The b \u2192 s\u03b3 transition is a flavor-changing neutral current process forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM). It proceeds at low rate through radiative penguin loop diagrams. Since the loop diagram is the only contribution, effects of new particles within the loop predicted by many new physics models (NP) can be investigated by a precise measurement of the branching fraction [1][2][3]. The inclusive branching fraction of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 transition is sensitive to NP as it is theoretically well described in the SM. The SM calculation for the branching fraction has been performed at next-to-next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion; for a photon energy above 1.6 GeV in the B meson rest frame, the calculations predict a branching fraction of B\u00f0B \u2192 X s \u03b3\u00de \u00bc \u00f03.15AE 0.23\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 [1] or \u00f02.98 AE 0.26\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 [4], where B is eitherB 0 or B \u2212 , and X s denotes all the hadron combinations that carry strangeness of \u00fe1. Charge conjugation is implied throughout this article. The dominant uncertainty of the expectation comes from the nonperturbative corrections. The increase in background with decreasing photon energy limits the ability to make measurements below a minimum photon energy. The measured branching fraction is extrapolated to a photon energy threshold of 1.6 GeV to compare with the theoretical expectation. The current measured world average is B\u00f0B \u2192 X s \u03b3\u00de \u00bc \u00f03.40 AE 0.21\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 [5]. This value is consistent with the SM prediction within the uncertainties.",

In the inclusive signal MC, various resonances and final states are simulated. The photon energy spectrum is produced following the Kagan-Neubert model [9] in the inclusive signal MC. This model has two parameters: the b quark mass (m b ) and the Fermi-motion parameter of the b quark inside the B meson (\u03bc 2 \u03c0 ). The nominal values of these parameters are determined from a best fit to the Belle inclusive photon energy spectrum [10]: m b \u00bc 4.440 GeV=c 2 and \u03bc 2 \u03c0 \u00bc 0.750 GeV 2 . In the inclusive X s mass region, the generated light quark pair is fragmented into final state hadrons in PYTHIA [11]. The signal reconstruction efficiency depends on the particle content in the final state; thus, it is important to determine the breakdown of the final state using data.

D meson candidates of the major decay modes are reconstructed with combinations of particles used in the X s reconstruction. The event is rejected if any of the D meson candidates falls in a veto window around the D mass. We set the central value and the width of the veto window depending on the charge of the D candidate and whether or not the D candidate is reconstructed in a mode with a \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 meson. Consequently, 90% (23%) of the signal (background) is kept. The second and dominant category is continuum. We reduce this background by applying a selection criterion based on the event shape. We perform a multivariate analysis with a neural network [13] that uses the following input variables: (1) the likelihood ratio of modified Fox-Wolfram moments [14,15], (2) the cosine of the angle between the B candidate and the z axis, (3) the angle between the thrust axis of the B candidate's decay particles and that of the remaining particles in the event, (4) the thrust calculated with the remaining particles in the event, (5) the sphericity, (6) the aplanarity, (7) the flavor dilution factor of the accompanying B meson that ranges from zero for no flavor information to unity for unambiguous flavor assignment [16] and (8) the signal probability density for the \u0394E value. Variables (1)- (6) are calculated in the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de rest frame. The neural network is trained with signal and qq-background MC events with 2.2 GeV=c 2 < M X s < 2.8 GeV=c 2 . The neural network output classifier (NN classifier) is also optimized in this region since the measurement here is difficult and incurs a large systematic uncertainty, while the signal in the low M X s region is observed relatively easily. We obtain a NN classifier between \u22121 and \u00fe1, shown in Fig. 1, which achieves good separation between the signal and the qq background.

The final states are divided into ten categories, defined in Table II  [19], to calibrate the MC selection efficiencies to those of data. In Table III, we compare the expected relative proportion of each category in data and MC. We find that the MC overestimates the fraction of the low multiplicity final-state K\u03c0 by more than a factor of two (i.e., mode categories 1 and 2). In order to calibrate the proportions in the MC, we vary four relevant parameters in the nominal PYTHIA fragmentation model: the suppression factor of s-quark pair production compared with uor d-quark pair production [PARJ(2)], the probabilities for forming a spin-1 meson [PARJ (11), PARJ(15)], and an extra suppression factor for \u03b7 production in fragmentation [PARJ(25)]. The proportions in the calibrated MC are given in the rightmost column of Table III. The total \u03c7 2 is improved from 826 to 47 using this calibration technique over the 10 degrees of freedom corresponding to the 10 decay mode categories. There are several decay-mode categories whose proportions in the MC deviate significantly from those in data, especially in category 5 (K3\u03c0 without \u03c0 0 ). We investigated the fragmentation proportions in four M X s regions (1.15-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-2.4 and 2.4-2.8 GeV=c 2 ) in the data and the calibrated MC shown in Table IV. However, several mode categories in the calibrated MC have large deviations from those in the data. We find that the fine-tuning of the PYTHIA fragmentation is insufficient to accurately describe the data and, therefore, we calibrate directly using the ratio of the proportion for each mode category in data to that in the MC in the four mass regions shown in Table V. The uncertainty on the ratio is the statistical uncertainty in fitting each mode category in data. Measurements of the K2\u03c0 0 signals (mode category 8) with 2.0 GeV=c 2 < M X s < 2.8 GeV=c 2 are difficult. Thus, the calibration by the factors in Table V is not applied to mode category 8 in the range 2.0 GeV=c 2 < M X s < 2.8 GeV=c 2 . The signal efficiencies in each M X s bin before and after the calibration are reported in Table VI.  ",

To mimic the conditions of a B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decay, one of the leptons from the J=\u03c8 is combined with the X s candidate to ensure that the X s mass lies within the D-veto region. This lepton is chosen such that the electric charge of X s is \u22121, 0 or 1 after the lepton is added; if the original X s is neutral, the lower-energy lepton is chosen. The invariant-mass distribution of the D meson candidate in the X s J=\u03c8 control sample has a broad peak at the nominal D mass region for M X s > 2.0 GeV=c 2 , just as in the signal sample. The difference in the D-veto efficiency between the MC and data is evaluated by this control sample.",
