The study is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions recorded by the LHCb experiment. The spectrum of excited \u039b + c states that decay into D 0 p is studied. The masses, widths and quantum numbers of the \u039b c (2880) + and \u039b c (2940) + resonances are measured. The constraints on the spin and parity for the \u039b c (2940) + state are obtained for the first time. A near-threshold enhancement in the D 0 p amplitude is investigated and found to be consistent with a new resonance, denoted the \u039b c (2860) + , of spin 3/2 and positive parity.",

Studies of direct CP violation in these decays can help constrain the parameters of the Standard Model and New Physics effects in a similar way as in decays of beauty mesons [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Studies of the decay dynamics of beauty baryons can provide important information on the spectroscopy of charmed baryons, since the known initial state provides strong constraints on the quantum numbers of intermediate resonances. The recent observation of pentaquark states at LHCb [8] has renewed the interest in baryon spectroscopy. .

A measurement of the branching fraction of this decay with respect to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 mode was reported by the LHCb collaboration using a data sample corresponding to 1.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity [9]. The \u039b 0 b \u2192 D 0 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay includes resonant contributions in the D 0 p channel that are associated with intermediate excited \u039b + c states, as well as contributions in the p\u03c0 \u2212 channel due to excited nucleon (N ) states. The study of the D 0 p part of the amplitude will help to constrain the dynamics of the Cabibbo-suppressed decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 D 0 pK \u2212 , which is potentially sensitive to the angle \u03b3 of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix [10,11]. The analysis of the D 0 p amplitude is interesting in its own right. One of the states decaying to D 0 p, the \u039b c (2940) + , has a possible interpretation as a D * N molecule [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. There are currently no experimental constraints on the quantum numbers of the \u039b c (2940) + state.",

In addition to the ground state \u039b + c and to the \u039b c (2595) + and \u039b c (2625) + states, which are identified as the members of the P -wave doublet, a D-wave doublet with higher mass is predicted. One of the members of this doublet could be the state known as the \u039b c (2880) + , which is measured to have spin and parity J P = 5/2 + [22,23], while no candidate for the other state has been observed yet. Several theoretical studies provide mass predictions for this state and other excited charm baryons [21,[24][25][26][27][28][29]. The BaBar collaboration has previously reported indications of a structure in the D 0 p mass spectrum close to threshold, at a mass around 2.84 GeV, 1 which could be the missing member of the D-wave doublet [30].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

The convention Im(a \u2212 ) \u2261 0 for the \u039b c (2880) + is used.

The overall efficiency is then given by the average of the two profiles, weighted according to the ratio of yields of the two classes of events in data.

For the limited-size sample of background events this approach appears more suitable than a kernel-based technique. The parametrisation is obtained using an iterative procedure where Gaussian components are added to the model one by one; at each iteration the parameters of all components are adjusted using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit. The result of the procedure is shown in figure 5(b). The baseline parametrisation is a sum of 25 two-dimensional Gaussian components.

Differences between the helicity and the covariant formalism are mainly associated with the broad amplitude components and are therefore treated as a part of the uncertainty due to the nonresonant model.

The mass of the \u039b c (2860) + state is consistent with recent predictions for an orbital D-wave \u039b + c excitation with quantum numbers 3/2 + based on the nonrelativistic heavy quark-light diquark model [24] and from QCD sum rules in the HQET framework [26].",

Finally, the fit in region 4, M (D 0 p) < 3.00 GeV, which includes the \u039b c (2940) + state, gives information about the properties of this resonance and the relative magnitudes of the resonant and nonresonant contributions.

Since the behaviour of the slowly-varying D 0 p amplitude is consistent with the presence of a resonance in the J P = 3/2 + wave and nonresonant amplitudes in the 1/2 + , 1/2 \u2212 , and 3/2 \u2212 waves, the same model is used to describe those parts of the amplitude in the extended fit region. The \u039b c (2940) + resonance is modelled by a Breit-Wigner lineshape. The masses and widths of the \u039b c (2940) + and \u039b c (2860) + states are floated in the fit, while those of the \u039b c (2880) + resonance are fixed to their nominal values[23]. Several variants of the fit are performed in which the spin of \u039b c (2940) + is assigned to be 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 or 7/2, with both positive and negative parities considered. Two different parametrisations of the nonresonant components are considered: the exponential model (taken as the baseline) and a second-order polynomial (eq. (3.14)).The results of the fits are given in table 8. For both nonresonant parametrisations, the best fit has a \u039b c (2940) + spin-parity assignment of 3/2 \u2212 . The results of the fit with this hypothesis and an exponential model for the nonresonant amplitudes, which is taken as the baseline for fit region 4, are shown in figure 13.
