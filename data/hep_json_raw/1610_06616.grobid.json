            "text": "We report the first measurement of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ALL for mid-rapidity di-jet production in polarized pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 200 GeV. The dijet cross section was measured and is shown to be consistent with next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD predictions. ALL results are presented for two distinct topologies, defined by the jet pseudorapidities, and are compared to predictions from several recent NLO global analyses. The measured asymmetries, the first such correlation measurements, support those analyses that find positive gluon polarization at the level of roughly 0.2 over the region of Bjorken-x > 0.05. Determining the helicity distribution of the gluons within a proton as a function of momentum fraction, \u2206g(x), remains an important challenge in high-energy nuclear physics. We do not yet understand the decomposition of the proton's spin into contributions from the spins and orbital angular momenta of its internal quarks and gluons, although high-precision, polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments [1] have shown that less than a third is due to the summed intrinsic spins of the quarks and anti-quarks for x 10 \u22123 [2][3][4][5]. These fixed-target polarized DIS data only weakly constrain the gluon polarization from inclusive measurements through scaling violations due to the limited coverage of photon virtuality Q 2 . The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has enabled more direct studies of gluons by colliding beams of high-energy polarized protons [6], which directly involve gluons via the quark-gluon (qg) and gluon-gluon (gg) scattering processes that dominate at RHIC pp energies [7]. While leading-order analyses of DIS data with high-p T hadron pairs have shown hints of positive gluon polarization [8,9], the tightest constraints on \u2206g(x) and its integral over moderate gluon momentum fractions, x > 0.05, are provided by next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) global analyses that incorporate the inclusive jet [10][11][12][13] and \u03c0 0 [14][15][16] longitudinal double-spin asymmetries measured by STAR and PHENIX, respectively, at RHIC. The most recent such analyses [17,18] now find compelling evidence for positive gluon polarization of roughly 0.2 over the range x > 0.05; they also demonstrate the importance of the RHIC data in reaching this conclusion.",

The polarization of each of the two colliding proton beams, denoted blue (B) and yellow (Y), was determined for each RHIC fill using proton-carbon-based Coulomb-Nuclear Interference polarimeters [19], which were calibrated using a polarized hydrogen gas-jet target [20]. The luminosity-weighted average polarizations of the two beams were P B = 56% and P Y = 57%. The A LL analysis took into account the decay of beam polarization over the course of a RHIC fill. The product P B P Y used in the asymmetry measurement had a relative uncertainty of 6.5% [21].",

These jets were required to be more than 120 \u2022 apart in azimuth. Further conditions were placed on the di-jets in order to ensure they reflected the partonic hard scattering and to reduce the contributions from background. This required that at least one jet contained energy from charged tracks, and di-jets containing tracks with p T above 30 GeV/c, where TPC momentum resolution is poor, were removed from the analysis. The later cut was implemented to eliminate di-jets with highly imbalanced jet transverse momenta. These events arose when one track in the event was misreconstructed to have an artificially high p T . To facilitate comparison with theoretical predictions, an asymmetric condition was placed on the transverse momenta of the jets [7], such that one jet in the pair had p T \u2265 8.0 GeV/c and the other had p T \u2265 6.0 GeV/c. Finally, it was required that at least one jet in the pair points to a jet patch that fired the JP2 or AJP (asymmetry and cross section) or JP1 (asymmetry only) trigger.",

The corrected yield was obtained by unfolding the raw di-jet yield to the particle level using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method as implemented within the RooUnfold package [29], which corrects for bin migration effects due to finite detector resolution and acceptance. The input to SVD is a simulated 'response matrix', which relates the mass of di-jets found at the detector level to the mass of the corresponding di-jets at particle level on an event-by-event basis. Di-jet matching between detector and particle level was done by finding the closest particle-level jet in \u03b7-\u03c6 space to each detector-level jet in the event, and requiring these jets to be within \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c6 2 \u2264 0.5. There is a modest but systematic tendency for the detector-level di-jet mass to fall below the particle-level mass due to finite track reconstruction efficiency. The mass migration and detector-level purities encoded in the response matrix are given in the supplemental materials [31]. Once the raw yield had been unfolded back to the particle level, a correction for the detector, reconstruction, and trigger efficiencies was applied. Figure 2 shows the measured di-jet cross section, indicating the associated systematic uncertainty (solid green band) and a theoretical prediction (single-hatched blue bar) obtained from the NLO di-jet production code of de Florian et al. [7] using the CT10 parton distribution function (PDF) set [30] (see supplementary material for values [31]). The theoretical predictions were generated using the same jet algorithm and resolution parameter as the data. The systematic uncertainty budget of the data contains contributions from uncertainties on track reconstruction efficiency and calorimeter tower energy scale (each ranging from 3% to 15%) as well as uncertainties on track p T resolution and the unfolding procedure. The detector uncertainties were propagated to the cross section by altering the simulated detector response when creating the response matrix, and then using this modified matrix to extract a new cross section. The systematic uncertainty is the difference between the nominal and modified cross sections. In addition to the above (strongly correlated) point-to-point systematics, a systematic of 8.8% common to all points due to uncertainty in the extraction of the integrated luminosity is quoted, but not included in the height of the systematic uncertainty boxes.",

The factorization and renormalization scales were also varied independently between the limits above, but the resulting deviation was always less than the simultaneous case.

The asymmetry A LL is presented for two distinct topologies: 'same-sign' in which both jets have either positive or negative pseudorapidity, and 'opposite-sign' in which one jet has positive and the other negative pseudorapidity. The opposite-sign topology selects events arising from relatively symmetric (in x) partonic collisions, whereas same-sign events select more asymmetric collisions. The most asymmetric, high-p T collisions are preferentially between a high momentum (high x and therefore highly polarized) quark and a low momentum gluon. The control over initial kinematics achievable with di-jets can be seen in Fig. 3 which presents the partonic momentum fraction distributions (weighted by partonic A LL ) of the gluons as obtained from PYTHIA for a sample of detector level di-jets with 19.0 < M < 23.0 GeV/c 2 , as well as for inclusive jets with 8.4 < p T < 11.7 GeV/c. The increase in x resolution achievable with di-jets compared to inclusive jets is evident from the much narrower di-jet x distributions. The asymmetric nature of the collisions in the samesign events (upper plot) can be seen in the separation of the high-and low-x distributions, whereas the oppositesign events (lower plot) sample an intermediate x range. Other di-jet mass bin choices sample different gluon x regions.",

The STAR trigger is more efficient for certain sub-processes [13], altering the sub-process fractions in the data-set and thereby shifting the measured A LL . Further distortions can arise due to systematic shifts caused by the finite resolution of the detector coupled with a rapidly falling invariant mass distribution. Corrections were applied to the raw A LL values to compensate for these effects. A trigger and reconstruction bias correction was determined by comparing A LL from simulation at the detector and parton levels using several polarized PDFs which predict asymmetries that 'bracket' the measured A LL values. Although PYTHIA does not include parton polarization effects, asymmetries could be reproduced via a re-weighting scheme in which each event was assigned a weight equal to the partonic asymmetry as determined by the hard-scattering kinematics and (un)polarized PDF sets. The trigger and reconstruction bias correction in each mass bin was determined by evaluating \u2206A LL \u2261 A detector PDFs, then taking the average of the minimum and maximum values found. These corrections to A LL varied from 0.0006 at low mass to 0.0048 at high mass. Half of the difference between the minimum and maximum \u2206A LL was taken as a systematic uncertainty on the correction. Figure 4 presents the final di-jet A LL measurement for the same-sign (top) and opposite-sign (bottom) topological configurations as a function of di-jet invariant mass, which has been corrected back to the parton level. The correction to parton level is achieved by shifting each point by the average difference between the detector and parton-level di-jet masses for a given detector-level bin. The heights of the uncertainty boxes represent the systematic uncertainty on the A LL values due to the trigger and reconstruction bias (3-32 \u00d710 \u22124 ) and residual transverse polarization components in the beams (3-26 \u00d710 \u22124 ). The relative luminosity uncertainty (5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) also results in an uncertainty in the vertical dimension that is common to all points and is represented by the gray band on the horizontal axis. This uncertainty was evaluated by comparing relative luminosity values obtained using the STAR BBCs and ZDCs, as well as from quantitative inspection of a number of single-and double-spin asymmetries expected to yield null results. The widths of the boxes represent the systematic uncertainty associated with the corrected di-jet mass values and, in addition to contributions from the uncertainty on the correction to the parton level, include uncertainties on calorimeter tower gains and efficiencies as well as TPC momentum resolution and tracking efficiencies. A further uncertainty was added in quadrature to account for the difference between the PYTHIA parton level and NLO pQCD di-jet cross sections. This PYTHIA vs. NLO pQCD uncertainty dominates in all but the lowest mass bin, rendering the di-jet mass uncertainties highly correlated. The A LL values and associated uncertainties can be found in Tab. I with more detail in the supplemental materials [31].",

However, for both topological configurations, the measured asymmetries tend to lie above the theoretical predictions at low invariant mass. This suggests the di-jet data may prefer a somewhat higher gluon polarization at low x than the current global analyses. The di-jet asymmetry results presented here represent an important advance in the experimental investigation of the gluon polarization and will be the basis for future high statistics di-jet measurements at STAR. Correlation measurements capture a more complete picture of the hard scattering kinematics and therefore, as shown in Fig. 3, offer better determination of the gluon momentum fraction than is possible with inclusive jet measurements. This improvement in x resolution will allow global analyses to constrain better the behavior of \u2206g(x) as a function of x, thus reducing the uncertainty on extrapolations to poorly measured x regions and, ultimately, the integrated value of \u2206g(x).",

The A LL results support the most recent DSSV and NNPDF NLO global analyses, which included 2009 RHIC data and found the first non-zero \u2206G value for x > 0.05, and may indicate a slightly higher gluon polarization at lower x values.",
