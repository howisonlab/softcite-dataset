Results are derived from the complete Tevatron Run II dataset, with a measured integrated luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 of proton-antiproton data. The searches are performed for assumed Higgs masses between 90 and 200 GeV/c 2 . We observe an excess of events in the data compared with the background predictions, which is most significant in the mass range between 115 and 135 GeV/c 2 , consistent with the Higgs-like particle recently observed by ATLAS and CMS. The largest local significance is 2.7 standard deviations, corresponding to a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations. We also combine separate searches for H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 W + W \u2212 , and find that the excess is concentrated in the H \u2192 bb channel, although the results in the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 channel are still consistent with the possible presence of a low-mass Higgs boson.",

Understanding the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, especially by testing for the presence or absence of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, has been a major goal of particle physics and a central part of the Fermilab Tevatron physics program. Both CDF and D0 collaborations have performed new combinations of multiple direct searches for the standard model Higgs boson [2]. The new searches include more data, additional channels, and improved analyses techniques compared to previous analysis. Results are derived from the complete Tevatron Run II dataset, with a measured integrated luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 of proton-antiproton data.

The direct searches from LEP [6], Tevatron [2], and LHC results [7,8] set the Higgs mass between 116.6 and 119.4 GeV/c 2 or between 122.1 and 127 GeV/c 2 at the 95% CL. Recently both LHC experiments [9,10] observed local excesses above the background expectations for a Higgs boson mass of approximately 125 GeV/c 2 . Much of the power of the LHC searches comes from gg \u2192 H production and Higgs boson decays to \u03b3\u03b3, W + W \u2212 , and Z + Z \u2212 , which probe the couplings of the Higgs boson to other bosons. In the allowed mass range, the Tevatron experiments are particularly sensitive to the association production of the Higgs boson with a weak vector boson in the bb channel, which probes the Higgs boson's couplings to b quarks.",

The cross section for W H production is twice that of ZH and is about a factor of 10 smaller than gg \u2192 H. The Higgs boson decay branching fraction is dominated by H \u2192 bb for the low-mass Higgs (m H < 135 GeV/c 2 ) and by H \u2192 W + W \u2212 or ZZ * for the high-mass Higgs (m H > 135 GeV/c 2 ). A search for a low-mass Higgs boson in the gg \u2192 H \u2192 bb channel is extremely challenging because the bb QCD production rate is many orders of magnitude larger than the Higgs boson production rate. Requiring the leptonic decay of the associated W or Z boson greatly improves the expected signal over background ratio in these channels.",

The search strategies employed by the CDF and D0 collaborations are quite similar and have been evolving constantly over time. We first maximize the signal acceptances by using efficient triggers, excellent lepton identifications, and powerful b-tagging, which can improve the signal to the background ratio up to the 1% level. Then we use multivariate analysis (MVA) to exploit the kinematic differences between the signal and background, which can further enhance the signal to the background ratio up to the 10% level in the high score regions. The same strategies have been used to help discover the single-top and diboson processes at the Tevatron, which provide a solid ground for how to isolate a small signal out of the huge background.",

The W H \u2192 lvbb is the most sensitive channel that gives one high P T lepton, large / E T , and two b-jets.

Because of the missed neutrinos in the final state, the Higgs mass can not be reconstructed. We have to rely on the event kinematic that distinguishes signal from background. For example, the \u2206\u03c6 of two leptons from the Higgs decay prefers a smaller \u2206\u03c6 than the background due to the fact that the Higgs is a scalar particle.

Both CDF and D0 use MVA b-tagging to exploit the decay of long-lived B hadron as displaced tracks/vertices. The typical efficiency is about 40-70% with a mistag rate of 1-5% per jet. Recently CDF combined their existing b-taggers into a Higgs Optimized b-tagger (HOBIT) [14] using a neural network tagging algorithm, based on sets of kinematic variables sensitive to displaced decay vertices and tracks within jets with large transverse impact parameters relative to the hard-scatter vertices. Using an operating point which gives an equivalent rate of false tags, the new algorithm improves upon previous b-tagging efficiencies by \u2248 20%. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of b-tag efficiency vs mistag rejection for the existing taggers and HOBIT b-tagger as shown in the black curve. The b-tag efficiency is calibrated using the tt events selected in the W + three or more jets sample and the b-enriched inclusive electron data, while the mistag rate is determined using the W + one jet sample. The ratio of b-tag efficiency per b-jet measured from the data and the Monte Carlo is used as a scale factor to correct for the differences in the Monte Carlo modeling, To discriminate Higgs signal events against background, using MVA would improve the background rejection with a sensitivity gain of 25%, compared to using a single variable alone, such as the dijet mass. We can further improve MVA by training different backgrounds, splitting events into sub-channels based on S/B, e.g. lepton type, number of jets.

It provides a clean signature, but has a low event yield due to a small branching fraction of Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . We select events with two high P T leptons from Z decay and two or three jets. Events are further divided based on lepton type, jet multiplicity, and the number of b-tagged jets, similar to W H \u2192 l\u03bdbb. To increase signal accepance D0 loosens the selection criteria for one of the leptons to include an isolated track not reconstructed in the muon detector or an electron from the inter-cryostat region of the D0 calorimeter. CDF uses neural networks to select loose dielectron and dimuon candidates. D0 applies a kinematic fit to optimize reconstruction while CDF corrects jet energies for the missing E T using a neural network approach. D0 uses random forests of decision trees to provide the final discriminant for sitting limits. CDF utilizes a multi-layer discriminant based on neural networks where separate discriminant functions are used to define four separate regions of the final discriminant function. Fig. 5 shows the final discriminant optimized for a Higgs signal (m H = 115 GeV/c 2 ) in the b-tagged events from CDF and the double b-tagged events from D0, respectively. There seem to be some excess of events in the high score signal region, but not statistically significant yet.

We require / E T > 50 GeV and two b-tagged jets. Both CDF and D0 use a track-based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false / E T . In addition both CDF and D0 utilize multivariate technique, a neural network for CDF and a boosted decision tree for D0, to further discriminate against the multi-jet background. The final discriminant is obtained for a Higgs signal (m H = 115 GeV/c 2 ) by combining dijet mass, track / E T , and other kinematic variables, which are shown in Fig. 6 for CDF and D0, respectively.

The most sensitive channel is both W decaying leptonic that gives an opposite-signed dilepton pair, large missing Et, and some jets from the initial state radiation. The presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the precise reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass. We have to rely on the event kinematic that distinguishes signal from background based on the scalar nature of the Higgs boson. We also include the processes W H \u2192 W W + W \u2212 and ZH \u2192 ZW + W \u2212 that give rise to like-sign dilepton and trilepton in the final states. Fig. 7 shows the \u2206\u03c6 distribution of two opposite-signed leptons in the zero jet bin. The red line is for the signal, which prefers a smaller \u2206\u03c6 than most backgrounds. By combining the \u2206\u03c6 with other kinematics we obtain a multivariate discriminant shown in Fig. 7 that improves the analysis significantly. We set a 95% upper limit on the production cross section times branching ratio over the standard model prediction as a function of the tested Higgs mass after combing all H \u2192 W + W \u2212 channels including the low mass dileptons, the same sign, and trileptons from W H and ZH, as shown in Fig. 8.

When corrected for the look-elsewhere effect (LEE), which accounts for the possibility of selecting the strongest of several random excesses in the range 115 < m H < 200 GeV/c 2 , the global significance of the excess is 2.2 sigma.

            "text": "In clusion, with a full dataset and many years of hard work, the Tevatron has finally achieved the SM Higgs sensitivity over most of the mass range up to 185 GeV/c 2 . We observe an excess of events in the data compared with the background predictions, which is most significant in the mass range between 115 and 135 GeV/c 2 , consistent with the Higgs-like particle recently observed by ATLAS and CMS. The largest local significance is 2.7 standard deviations, corresponding to a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations. We also combine separate searches for H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 W + W \u2212 , and find that the excess is concentrated in the H \u2192 bb channel, although the results in the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 channel are still consistent with the possible presence of a low-mass Higgs boson.
