The distributions were constructed using charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5 and with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV, in events with at least one such charged particle with transverse momentum above 1 GeV. These distributions characterise the angular distribution of energy and particle flows with respect to the charged particle with highest transverse momentum, as a function of both that momentum and of charged-particle multiplicity. The results have been corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, experimentally establishing the level of underlying-event activity at LHC Run 2 energies and providing inputs for the development of event generator modelling. The current models in use for UE modelling typically describe this data to 5% accuracy, compared with data uncertainties of less than 1%.",

As the UE is an intrinsic part of the same proton-proton collision as any \"signal\" partonic interaction, accurate description of its properties by Monte Carlo (MC) event generators is important for the LHC physics programme.",

As it is significantly influenced by physics not currently calculable from first principles, the measurement of the UE's properties is crucial not only for better understanding of the mechanisms involved but also to provide input for empirical tuning of the free parameters of phenomenological UE models in MC event generators.",

This measurement follows the fiducial particle definition used in the ATLAS 13 TeV minimum-bias measurement [14] excluding particle species with \u03c4 in the range 30 ps to 300 ps and their decay products. The charged particles falling in this range are strange baryons with a very low reconstruction probability, whose decays are inconsistently modelled in MC generators. Their exclusion from the fiducial acceptance definition hence avoids the need to apply large and poorly defined corrections to particle level for these species, making the measurement more accurate.",

An ansatz is used to regularise cross-section growth at low p T , with a weak power-law evolution of the regularisation parameter with \u221a s. The current form of the model also interleaves MPI emissions with parton shower evolution, allows several forms of matter overlap parameterisation, and interacts with a non-perturbative annealing procedure for reconfiguration of colour strings during hadronisation (the \"colour reconnection\" mechanism).",

For the profile distributions, a weight proportional to the inverse of tracking efficiency (as above) was applied in each HBOM iteration step, k, to make the effect on the observable less dramatic and more easily parameterisable. To avoid correlations between observables with different k values, each X obs k was calculated independently, using a distinct random seed and k iterations of track discarding starting -11 -",

Figure 6 shows, for the transverse and trans-min/max azimuthal regions, the correlations of the average per-event mean transverse momentum, mean p T , with the transverse region's charged-particle multiplicity and the event's p lead T . The correlation with transverse charged-particle multiplicity N ch is a correlation between two different \"soft\" properties. This distribution is modelled to within 5% for all N ch by most of the generators and in all transverse region variants, but in all cases an underestimation of mean p T is visible until N ch 15. The best modelling is from Epos, whose maximum undershoot is \u223c3% at low N ch but which follows the data closely in all region definitions for higher transverse multiplicities. The Monash tune is the bestperforming Pythia 8 configuration, with a performance similar to that of Epos, while Pythia 8 A14 undershoots in the low-multiplicity events and Pythia 8 A2 overshoots at high-multiplicities -notably the regions not included in each tune's construction. Herwig 7 shows the largest variations, from a \u223c7% undershoot at low N ch to a 5% overshoot at N ch \u2248 30.",

The measured observables are defined using charged tracks and have been corrected to the level of primary charged particles. Correction of the results for detector effects was performed via a combination of tracking and vertexing efficiency weighting and HBOM unfolding, with the latter accounting for re-orientation and similar indirect effects not accounted for by the reweighting. Systematic uncertainties are included for the effects of all data processing steps, including the unfolding.",

This construction produces a set of observables collectively sensitive to each of the components of the underlying event. The observables in this study characterise the correlations of a) each azimuthal region's mean p T and mean charged-particle multiplicity densities with the transverse momentum, p lead T , of the event's leading charged particle; and b) the per-event mean charged-particle p T with both p lead T and the transverse azimuthal region's charged-particle multiplicity. The correlations with p lead T characterise the degree of connection between the underlying event and the hardest partonic scattering in the pp collision, while correlations with the transverse regions' charged-particle multiplicities probe the particle production mechanisms between underlying-event components.",

Comparisons against predictions from several commonly used MC generator configurations indicate that for most observables the models describe the underlying-event data to better than 5% accuracy. But this level of variation is far greater than the experimental uncertainty of the measurements, and there is evidence of systematic mismodelling. The model defects are particularly acute in the transition from generic soft inelastic interactions -so-called \"minimum bias\" scattering -to secondary interactions in the presence of hard partonic scattering. Some improvement to MC tunes in light of these data will hence be of benefit to physics studies in LHC Run 2. The Epos MC generator, specialised for simulation of inclusive soft QCD processes, displays particularly discrepant features as the p lead T scale increases, casting doubt on its suitability for modelling LHC multiple pp interactions despite currently providing the best description of minimum-bias data.",
