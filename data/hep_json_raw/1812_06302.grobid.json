Supersymmetry extends space-time symmetry such that every fermion (boson) in the standard model (SM) has a bosonic (fermionic) partner [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Supersymmetric extensions of the SM yield solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem without the need for large fine tuning of fundamental parameters [13][14][15][16][17][18], exhibit gauge coupling unification [19][20][21][22][23][24], and can provide weakly interacting particle candidates for dark matter [25,26].",

To enhance sensitivity to specific types of SUSY signatures, the events are categorized according to the presence of jets consistent with high transverse momentum (p T ) hadronically decaying W bosons or top quarks, the number of identified charged leptons, the number of jets, and the number of b-tagged jets. The search is performed in bins of the razor variables M R and R 2 [1][2][3]. The result presented in this paper is the first search for SUSY from the CMS experiment that incorporates both Lorentz-boosted and \"non-boosted\" (resolved) event categories. This search strategy provides broad sensitivity to gluino and squark pair production in R-parity [27] conserving scenarios for a large variety of decay modes and branching fractions. The prediction of the SM background in the search regions (SRs) is obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation calibrated with data control regions (CRs) that isolate the major background components. Additional validation of the assumptions made by the background estimation method yields estimates of the systematic uncertainties.",

Compared to those searches, the razor kinematic variables explore alternative signal-sensitive phase space and add robustness to the understanding of the background composition and the potential systematic uncertainties in the background models. To give a characteristic example, for squark pair production with a squark mass of 1000 GeV and a neutralino mass of 100 GeV, we find that the overlap of signal events falling in the most sensitive tail regions of the razor kinematic variables and of other kinematic variables used in alternative searches described in ref.

Jets are clustered from PF candidates using the anti-k T algorithm [50,51] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and confirmed by in-situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, photon+jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [52]. Further details of the performance of the jet reconstruction can be found in ref. [53]. Jets used in any selection of this analysis are required to have p T > 30 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.4. To identify jets originating from b quarks, we use the \"medium\" working point of the combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) b jet tagger, which uses an inclusive vertex finder to select b jets [54]. The efficiency to identify a bottom jet is in the range of 50-65% for jets with p T between 20 and 400 GeV, while the misidentification rate for light-flavor quark and gluon jets (charm jets) is about 1 (10)%. We also use the \"loose\" working point of the CSVv2 b jet tagger to identify b jets to be vetoed in the definition of various CRs. The loose b jet tagging working point has an efficiency of 80% and a misidentification rate for light-flavor and gluon jets of 10%.",

The N -subjettiness variable is used to evaluate the consistency of a jet with having N subjets. To enhance discrimination, the ratios \u03c4 21 = \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 and \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 are used for the W boson and top quark tagging, respectively, with the criteria of \u03c4 21 < 0.40 and \u03c4 32 < 0.65. For tagging top quarks (\"t tagging\"), an additional requirement is imposed on the subjet b tagging discriminant based on the multivariate CSVv2 algorithm [54]. The efficiencies for W boson and top quark tagging are on average 66 and 15%, respectively, with mistagging rates of 4.0 and 0.1% [53]. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates on the plane perpendicular to the beams. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . Events containing signatures consistent with beam-induced background or anomalous noise in the calorimeters sometimes results in events with anomalously large values of p miss T and are rejected using dedicated filters [57,58]. The performance of the p miss T at CMS may be found in ref. [59]. Electrons are reconstructed by associating an energy cluster in the ECAL with a reconstructed track [60], and are identified on the basis of the electromagnetic shower shape, the ratio of energies deposited in the ECAL and HCAL, the geometric matching of the track and the calorimeter cluster, the track quality and impact parameter, and isolation. To improve the efficiency for models that produce a large number of jets, a so-called \"miniisolation\" technique is used, where the isolation cone shrinks as the momentum of the object increases. Further details are discussed in ref. [2]. Muons are reconstructed by combining tracks found in the muon system with corresponding tracks in the silicon tracking detectors [61], and are identified based on the quality of the track fit, the number of detector hits used in the tracking algorithm, the compatibility between track segments, and isolation. Two types of selections are defined for electrons and muons: a \"tight\" selection with an average efficiency of about 70-75%, and a \"loose\" selection with an efficiency of about 90-95%. The loose selections are required to have p T > 5 GeV, while the tight selections are required to have p T > 30 and 25 GeV for electrons and muons, respectively. Similarly electrons (muons) are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.5 (2.4), and electrons with |\u03b7| (of 1.442-1.556) in the transition region between the barrel and endcap ECAL are not considered because of limited electron reconstruction capabilities in that region.",

The variable R quantifies the degree of imbalance between the visible and invisible decay products and helps to suppress backgrounds which do not produce any weakly interacting particles. The combination of the two variables provide powerful discrimination between the SUSY signal and SM backgrounds. Single-electron or single-muon triggers are used to collect events in the one-lepton categories, with a total trigger efficiency of about 80% for reconstructed p T around 30 GeV, growing to 95% for reconstructed p T above 50 GeV. Events in the boosted category are collected using triggers that select events based on the p T of the leading jet and the scalar p T sum of all jets, H T . The trigger efficiency is about 50% at the low range of the M R and R 2 kinematic variables and grows to 100% for M R > 1.2 TeV and R 2 > 0.16. For the zero-lepton non-boosted event categories, dedicated triggers requiring at least two jets with p T > 80 GeV and loose thresholds on the razor variables M R and R 2 are used to collect the events.

For event categories with zero b-tagged jets, the background is primarily composed of the W( \u03bd)+jets and Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+jets processes, while for categories with two or more b-tagged jets it is dominated by the tt process. There are also small contributions at the level of a few percent from single top quark production, production of two or three electroweak bosons, and production of tt in association with a W or Z boson. The background prediction strategy relies on the use of CRs to isolate each background process, address deficiencies of the MC simulation using control samples in data, and estimate systematic uncertainties in the expected event yields. The CRs are defined such that they have no overlap with any SRs. For the dominant backgrounds discussed above, the primary sources of mismodeling come from inaccuracy in the MC prediction of the hadronic recoil spectrum and the jet multiplicity. Corrections to the MC simulation are applied first in bins of M R and R 2 , and then subsequently in the number of jets (N jets ) to address these modeling inaccuracies.

In the leptonic analysis SRs, the m T requirement suppresses lepton+jets tt events, and the dominant remaining tt background consists of tt events where both top quarks decayed leptonically, and one of the two leptons is not identified. It is therefore important to validate that the corrections to the tt simulation derived in the tight lepton CR also describe dileptonic tt events well. We perform this check by selecting an event sample enriched in dileptonic tt events, applying the corrections on the tt simulation prediction derived in the tight lepton CR, and evaluating the consistency of the data with the corrected prediction. This check is performed separately for each jet multiplicity category used in the analysis SRs. The dilepton tt-enriched sample consists of events with two tight electrons or muons with p T > 30 GeV and invariant mass larger than 20 GeV, at least one b-tagged jet with p T > 40 GeV, and p miss T > 40 GeV. Events with two same-flavor leptons with invariant mass between 76 and 106 GeV are rejected to suppress Drell-Yan background. The p miss T and the m T variables are computed treating one of the leptons in each event as visible and the other as invisible, and the requirement on the m T is subsequently applied. A systematic uncertainty in the dilepton tt background is assessed by comparing data with the MC prediction in the M R distribution for each jet multiplicity category.

To enhance sensitivity to a broad range of signal models, the events are categorized according to the number of leptons, the presence of jets consistent with hadronically decaying W bosons or top quarks, and the number of jets and b-tagged jets. The analysis uses \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Standard model backgrounds were estimated using control regions in data and Monte Carlo simulation yields in signal and control regions. Background estimation procedures were verified using validation regions with kinematics resembling that of the signal regions and closure tests. Data are observed to be consistent with the standard model expectation. The results were interpreted in the context of simplified models of pair-produced gluinos and direct top squark pair production. Limits on the gluino mass extend to 2.0 TeV, while limits on top squark masses reach 1.14 TeV. The combination of a large variety of final states enables this analysis to improve the sensitivity in various signal scenarios. The analysis extended the exclusion limit of the gluino mass from the CMS experiment by \u2248100 GeV in decays to a low-mass top squark and a top quark, and the exclusion limit of the top squark mass by \u224820 GeV in direct top squark pair production.
