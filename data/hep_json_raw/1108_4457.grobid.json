This beam is delivered to the target station where it strikes the carbon target, resulting in the production of pions and kaons; the pions and kaons are bent toward the direction of SK by a magnetic field produced by magnetic horns. Neutrinos are produced as decay products of pions and kaons. All particles except neutrinos and high-energy (> 5 GeV) muons are absorbed by a beam dump located 110 m downstream of the target. The most important feature of the T2K neutrino beamline is the off-axis beam, which was originally proposed in [12]. The details of the concept of the off-axis angle in T2K have been reported in [13]. When the beamline construction was started, the off-axis angle was tunable [13] because the optimum off-axis angle was unknown. The value of \u2206m 2 23 from other experiments [5,14] was considered, and the off-axis angle was accordingly adjusted to be 2.5 \u2022 in 2007. The corresponding peak energy of the neutrino flux is approximately 600 MeV, and the oscillation study is the most sensitive around \u2206m 2 23 = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 .",

            "text": "The history of proton beam delivery is shown in Figure 3. The beam duration of the T2K beam is \u223c5 \u00b5s. In early 2010, the beam cycle was 3.52 s, and each pulse contained 6 bunches. This was changed to a beam cycle of 3.04 s, and 8 bunches per pulse in order to increase the beam power. The number of protons per pulse (ppp) was improved from \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 13 ppp to \u223c 9 \u00d7 10 13 ppp. The last beam power corresponds to about 150 kW. This value is about 1/5 of the design value, 750 kW. We have accumulated 1.43\u00d710 20 protons on target (pot) until March 11, 2011. This is about 2% of our goal, i.e., \u223c 78\u00d710 20 pot, which can be attained by the beam operation for 5 years with 750 kW.",

The earthquake and followed tsunamis resulted in the death of more than 15000 people. In addition, the Fukushima nuclear power stations, which was damaged by the tsunamis, were found to have crucial radiation leaks. J-PARC is located about 260 km from the seismic center, and about 100 km from the Fukushima nuclear power stations. No one at J-PARC was injured by the earthquake and tsunamis, but some of the accelerator and beamline components were damaged. After the radiation leak from Fukushima, the radiation dose in the J-PARC area was considerably higher than the normal value. However, the radiation dose has already returned to the normal value, and recoveries of the accelerator/beamline components are in progress. We will resume the J-PARC operation in December 2011 and restart the T2K data-taking as soon as possible.",
