If these peaks are meson resonances, they would have a minimal quark substructure of ccd\u016b and be unmistakeably exotic. However, even though the Belle signals have more than 5\u03c3 statistical significance, the experimental situation remains uncertain in that none of these peaks have yet been confirmed by other experiments. An analysis by the BABAR Collaboration of B \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 K neither confirms nor contradicts the Belle claim for the Z(4430) \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 [5]. In the BABAR analysis, B \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 K decays were also studied, and no evidence for Z(4430) \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 was found.",

This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the histogram shows the distribution of cos \u03b8 \u03c0 \u2212 values for a MC sample of B \u2192 Z(4430) \u2212 K, Z(4430) \u2212 \u2192\u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 events where the Z(4430) \u2212 mass and width closely correspond to Belle's reported values [3].

The search was performed using the full BABAR data set equivalent to integrated luminosity of 413 fb \u22121 (455\u00d710 6 BB candidates) collected at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. The BABAR search covered two additional decay modes (B \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 K) that were not considered in the Belle study. The J/\u03c8 modes contain about six times (see Table II in Ref. [5]) more data than those with the \u03c8 \u2032 and provide a powerful, high statistics tool for understanding the background. The Dalitz plots for the four decay modes are shown in Fig. 4. The K\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution shows a clear K * (892) signal in all decay modes, and a visible K * 2 (1430) signal in the modes with a J/\u03c8 but less significant in the modes with \u03c8 \u2032 . Since the K\u03c0 \u2212 system dominates the Dalitz plot, the BABAR Collaboration studied the K\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution and the angular dependence. Similar contributions from the different wave intensities are obtained in the modes with K 0 S and K + (see Table III in Ref. [5]) and, therefore, the modes with K 0 S and K + are combined. The K\u03c0 \u2212 mass distributions are fitted 12 and 13 in Ref. [5]). The BABAR mass resolution at the Z(4430) \u2212 mass is 7 (4) MeV/c 2 for the modes with J/\u03c8 (\u03c8 \u2032 ) (see Fig. 6 in Ref. [5]). Each event is efficiency corrected, and the conclusions are based on distributions obtained after background subtraction. The average efficiency varies slightly as a function of the K\u03c0 \u2212 mass but can differ significantly between the different \u03c8 decay modes (see Fig. 7 in Ref. [5]), however there are significant variations in efficiency with cos \u03b8 K for certain regions of K\u03c0 \u2212 mass (see Fig. 36 in Ref. [5]).",

            "text": "The comparison between the \u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution and the relevant K\u03c0 \u2212 reflection was performed (see section 9 in Ref. [5]). This comparison is essential to investigate the need for a Z(4430) \u2212 signal above the K\u03c0 \u2212 reflection. Following the five K\u03c0 \u2212 regions (see section 10.D in Ref. [5]) defined in the Dalitz plots for the final samples in the decay modes (a) Belle analysis [3], the projection is implemented in each K\u03c0 \u2212 interval as shown in Fig. 6. In each figure, a comparison (not a fit) between the data and the K\u03c0 \u2212 reflection is shown. Note that only one normalization factor for the K\u03c0 \u2212 regions is used for each \u03c8 mode. The K\u03c0 \u2212 reflections onto the \u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 mass distributions describe well the data, with a small statistical fluctuation at m K\u03c0 \u2212 < 0.795 GeV/c 2 . The \u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution and the overall K\u03c0 \u2212 projection are shown in Fig. 7. No significant evidence for Z(4430) \u2212 has been obtained. The K\u03c0 \u2212 projection onto the \u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution is used as a nonpeaking background. With such a background shape and a BW function for a Z(4430) \u2212 signal, a signal is obtained for the overall K\u03c0 \u2212 region, but with shifted mass value. A similar small signal is obtained in the K * (892) and K * 2 (1430) combined regions. A \u223c 2\u03c3 peak is obtained when the K * (892) and K * 2 (1430) regions are vetoed. No (or a negative) signal for Z(4430) \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 was found.  Although the Belle Collaboration used a data sample equivalent to 1.46 times that of BABAR's, because of different selection criteria BABAR has more events per fb \u22121 . A direct comparison between the two m \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 distributions is shown in Fig. 8. For comparison purposes, the BABAR distribution is not corrected for efficiency, however both Belle and BABAR distributions are background subtracted and shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b), respectively. The BABAR distribution is scaled up by the factor 1.18 in order to normalize to the Belle data between the crosshatched regions of Fig. 8(c). The difference plot is shown in  Belle's Dalitz analysis of B \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 K After the BABAR Collaboration did not confirm the Z(4430) \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 mass peak in their analysis of B \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 K decays [5], the Belle Collaboration performed a reanalysis [9] of their data that took detailed account of possible reflections from the K\u03c0 \u2212 channel. Specifically, they modeled the B \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 K process as the sum of two-body decays B \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 K * i , where K * i denotes all of the known K * \u2192K\u03c0 \u2212 resonances that are kinematically accessible, and both with and with- . Figure 9 shows the \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution in different K\u03c0 \u2212 intervals as obtained from the Dalitz-plot analysis by the Belle Collaboration [9]. In the region between the K * (892) and the K * 2 (1430) (0.982 < m K\u03c0 < 1.332 GeV/c 2 , Fig. 9(c)), a Z(4430) \u2212 peak is present. The data points in Fig. 10 ",

It is therefore important that the Belle results are confirmed statistics. However, both experiments have completed data taking and the BABAR analysis used their complete dataset while the Belle analysis used about 75% of their final total data sample. Approximately 3 ab \u22121 of integrated luminosity would be necessary to bring the \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c0 \u2212 sample to the statistical level of BABAR's current J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 sample, and this amount of data will not be available until the operation of one of the Super-B factories, which will not happen for at least a few years. In the meantime, it would be valuable if BABAR performed a search for the Z 1 (4050) \u2212 and Z 2 (4250) \u2212 in the \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 \u2212 channel and Belle reproduced BABAR's study of the J/\u03c8 \u03c0 \u2212 channel using the existing data sets. The D0 and CDF experiments at the Tevatron have data on hand that could be used to carry out searches for inclusive production of the Z(4430) \u2212 and we hope that results will be available from them in the near future.",
