The CEP processes provide an ideal test ground for the proposed approach -here a pair of coincident final state protons, exiting the LHC beam vacuum chamber, are used to tag the event candidates. The fractional momenta of the final state protons are directly related to the invariant mass of the centrally produced system. The proposed approach [1,2] is independent of the particular decay modes of a centrally produced system, and substantially enhances the potential of observing new heavy particle states at the LHC. Performance of the customary Roman Pot technology is limited by the location of the pots, and the allowed transversal access to the beam.",

A measurement of the invariant mass of the decay products would be required to match the missing mass condition available by the measurement of the pair of final state proton fractional momentum losses. At higher central masses, M X \uf0b3 200 GeV, the photon-photon process (1a) dominates. The following example processes are considered: (1) Magnetic monopolium: Numerous experimental searches for magnetic monopoles have been carried out but all have met with failure. These experiments have led to a lower mass limit in the range from 350 \u2212 500 GeV. A way out of this impasse is the above old idea of Dirac [5], namely, monopoles are not seen freely because they are confined by their strong magnetic forces forming a bound state called monopolium [6]. Here the CEP produced monopolium states [7] are searched for by registering the pair of final state protons exiting the beam vacuum chamber at the distance of some \uf0b1230 meters from IP8 (MoEDAL/LHCb experiment); (2) Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCCs): Bjorken et al. proposed [8] that high energy hadron collisions could form disoriented chiral condensates (DCCs): regions of pseudo-vacuum, where the chiral order parameter is misaligned from its vacuum orientation in isospin space. The formation of DCCs occurs when the highly Lorentz contracted nuclei collide and leave behind baryon free plasma in the central rapidity region where the chiral symmetry is subsequently restored. The plasma cools down through rapid hydrodynamic expansion via non-equilibrium chiral phase transition. Detection of such disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) would probe the chiral structure of the QCD vacuum and/or the chiral phase transition of strong interactions at high temperature.",

            "text": "(3) W + Wpairs and anomalous couplings: Central exclusive production (CEP) of W + W \u2212 (Z 0 Z 0 ) pairs can be used both as a luminosity monitoring process [10] and as a process for studying basic physics questions beyond the Standard Model, such as anomalous vector boson couplings. In a recent publication the contribution of the \uf020\uf067\uf067 \u2192 W + W \u2212 (Z 0 Z 0 ) mechanism is compared to the gluon induced CEP process gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 [11]. The phase space integrated gluon induced CEP cross section is found to be considerably smaller (less than 1 fb), while the photon induced CEP is calculated to have a cross section of 115 fb. The photo-production process dominates at small fourmomentum transfers for a wide range of W + W \u2212 (Z 0 Z 0 ) invariant masses, and allows efficient analyses of anomalous triple-boson (WW/ZZ) and quartic-boson (WW/ZZ) couplings together with tests of the models beyond the Standard Model. The \uf020\uf067\uf067 \u2192 W + W \u2212 cross section peaks at M X \uf0bb 200 GeV yielding (in a symmetric case) a pair of protons exiting the beam vacuum chamber at \uf0b1 330 meters from the interaction point. All four LHC experiments have sufficient luminosity for studying the process; (4) The Standard Model (SM) and BSM Higgs bosons: The Higgs boson observations at the LHC are almost exclusively based on the \uf067\uf067 decay mode [12]. Measurement of the Higgs boson production in Central Exclusive Process (CEP) was first analysed by some of the authors, and the process pp \uf0ae p + (gg \uf0ae h 0 ) + p (1c) provides important complementary information concerning the spin-parity state of Higgs since J PC = 0 ++ state is strongly favoured in CEP. By tagging the Higgs event candidates independently of the Higgs decay products enables detailed analysis of the production mechanism and Higgs couplings. A measurement of the azimuthal angle between the final state protons can be used to discriminate between different Higgs production scenarios [13]. The Standard Model Higgs boson, when produced in the CEP process (1c), has a proton pair exiting the LHC beam vacuum chamber at a distance of \uf0b1 427 meters from the IP. ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments are here relevant counterparts due to their sufficiently high integrated luminosities; (5) Gluon jets: The jets produced in the CEP process: pp \uf0ae p + X + p, are practically always gluon jets, the purity vs. light quark jets is of the order of 10 3 [14]. The CEP jet final states can therefore be used for investigating gluon jets in detail, thereby turning the LHC into a gluon factory. Observables such as jet multiplicities, flavour and baryon number suppression can be accurately measured and compared to the inclusive minimum bias interactions. The uniquely pure gluon jet final states are available via the CEP process in all LHC experiments. The ALICE experiment, with its relatively low pile-up rates, has access to CEP produced gluon jets in the mass range of some 40-60 GeV; these events are tagged by the final state proton pairs exiting at \uf0b1 400 meters and beyond from IP2; (6) Gravitational waves: Fast transients caused by the gravitational waves have been recently observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) [3] in the frequency range of 35 to 250 Hz as predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Gravity will influence the storage rings used in particle physics accelerator systems, as shown earlier for the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) [15] at CERN and for the SPRing-8 in Japan [16]. According to [17], the change \uf044C of the reference value of the machine circumference changes due to the gravitational interaction induced by the tidal and seasonal forces. An overall change of the storage ring circumference can be expressed as",

The band widths reflect smearing in proton transverse momentum, p T . The following steps are taken in tagging the CEP event candidates for each IP (IP1/ATLAS, IP2/ALICE, IP5/CMS, and IP8/LHCb): (i) The candidate CEP events are scanned by locating pairs of coincident proton exits on the opposite sides of the interaction point (IP) in question (Figure 1.3, right panel), (ii) The tagged events are correlated with the LHC Beam Cross Overs (BCOs) within the time window for the chosen IP, (iii) The tagged LHC BCOs are analysed as candidates for the CEP events with central masses, M X , corresponding to a registered pair of exit points (Figure 1.3, right panel).",
