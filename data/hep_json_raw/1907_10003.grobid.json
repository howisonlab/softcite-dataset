            "text": "A measurement of the time-dependent CP-violating asymmetry in B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays is presented. Using a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 7 TeV in 2011, 8 TeV in 2012 and 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016, a signal yield of around 9000 B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays is obtained. The CP-violating phase \u03c6 sss s is measured to be \u22120.073 \u00b1 0.115(stat) \u00b1 0.027(syst) rad, under the assumption it is independent of the helicity of the \u03c6\u03c6 decay. In addition, the CP-violating phases of the transverse polarisations under the assumption of CP conservation of the longitudinal phase are measured. The helicity-independent direct CP-violation parameter is also measured, and is found to be |\u03bb| = 0.99 \u00b1 0.05(stat) \u00b1 0.01(syst). In addition, T -odd triple-product asymmetries are measured. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis of CP conservation in b \u2192ssss transitions. Finally, a limit on the branching fraction of the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay is determined to be B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) < 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90 % confidence level.",

            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM) the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay, where the \u03c6(1020) is implied throughout this paper, is forbidden at tree level and proceeds predominantly via a gluonic b \u2192 sss loop (penguin) process. Hence, this channel provides an excellent probe of new heavy particles entering the penguin quantum loops [1][2][3]. In the SM, CP violation is governed by a single phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix [4,5]. Interference caused by the resulting weak phase difference between the B 0 s -B 0 s oscillation and decay amplitudes leads to a CP asymmetry in the decay-time distributions of B 0 s and B 0 s mesons. For B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, which proceed via b \u2192 scc transitions, the SM prediction of the weak phase is \u22122 arg (\u2212V ts V * tb /V cs V * cb ) = \u22120.0369 +0.0010 \u22120.0007 rad according to the CKMfitter group [6], and \u22122 arg (\u2212V ts V * tb /V cs V * cb ) = \u22120.0370 \u00b1 0.0010 rad according to the UTfit collaboration [7]. The LHCb collaboration has measured the weak phase in several decay processes: B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 , B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 for the K + K \u2212 invariant mass region above 1.05 GeV/c, B 0 s \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c6 and B 0 s \u2192 D + s D \u2212 s , corresponding to the combined result of \u22120.041 \u00b1 0.025 rad [8]. These measurements are consistent with the SM prediction and place stringent constraints on CP violation in B 0 s -B 0 s oscillations [9]. The CP -violating phase, \u03c6 sss s , in the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay is expected to be small in the SM. Calculations using quantum chromodynamics factorisation (QCDf) provide an upper limit of 0.02 rad for its absolute value [1][2][3]. The previous most accurate measurement is \u03c6 sss s = \u22120.17 \u00b1 0.15 (stat) \u00b1 0.03 (syst) rad [10]. CP violation can also be probed by time-integrated triple-product asymmetries. These are formed from T -odd combinations of the momenta of the final-state particles. These asymmetries complement the decay-time-dependent measurement [11] and are expected to be close to zero in the SM [12]. Previous measurements of the triple-product asymmetries in B 0 s decays from the LHCb and CDF collaborations [10,13] have shown no significant deviations from zero.",

            "text": "The B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay is a P \u2192 V V decay, where P denotes a pseudoscalar and V a vector meson. This gives rise to longitudinal and transverse polarisation of the final states with respect to their direction of flight in the B 0 s reference frame, the fractions of which are denoted by f L and f T , respectively. In the heavy quark limit, f L is expected to be close to unity at tree level due to the vector-axial structure of charged weak currents [2]. This is found to be the case for tree-level B decays measured at the B Factories [14][15][16][17][18][19]. However, the dynamics of penguin transitions are more complicated. Previously LHCb reported a value of f L \u2261 |A 0 | 2 = 0.364 \u00b1 0.012 in B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays [10]. The measurement is in agreement with predictions from QCD factorisation [2,3]. The observed value of f L is significantly larger than that seen in the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 decay [20,21]. In addition to the study of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay, a search for the as yet unobserved decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 is made. In the SM this is an OZI suppressed decay [22,23], with an expected branching fraction in the range (0.1 \u2212 3.0) \u00d7 10 \u22128 [1,2,24,25]. However, the branching fraction can be enhanced, up to the 10 \u22127 level, in extensions to the SM such as supersymmetry with R-parity violation [25]. The most recent experimental limit was determined to be 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90 % confidence level [26].",

This paper reports a time-dependent analysis of B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays, where the \u03c6 meson is reconstructed in the K + K \u2212 final state, that measures the CP -violating phase, \u03c6 sss s , and the parameter |\u03bb|, that is related to the direct CP violation. Results on helicity-dependent weak phases are also presented, along with helicity amplitudes describing the P \u2192 V V transition and strong phases of the amplitudes. In addition, triple-product asymmetries for this decay are presented. The analysis also includes a search for the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6. Results presented here supersede the previous measurements based on data collected in 2011 and 2012 [10].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [29], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [30] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [31]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [27].",

In the software trigger, B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 candidates are selected either by identifying events containing a pair of oppositely charged kaons with an invariant mass within 30 MeV/c 2 of the known \u03c6 meson mass, m \u03c6 = 1019.5 MeV/c 2 [32], or by using a topological b-hadron trigger. This topological trigger requires a three-track secondary vertex with a large sum of the p T of the charged particles and significant displacement from the PV. At least one charged particle should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP with respect to any primary vertex greater than 16, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV fitted with and without the considered track.

The decay modes considered include B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 , \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c6pK \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c6K + , where the last decay mode could contribute if an extra kaon track is added. The B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c6K + decays do not contribute significantly. The B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 decay, resulting from a misidentification of a pion as a kaon, is vetoed by rejecting candidates which simultaneously have K + \u03c0 \u2212 (K + K \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) invariant masses within 50 (30) MeV/c 2 of the known K * 0 (B 0 ) masses. The K + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant masses are computed by taking the kaon with the highest probability of being misidentified as a pion and assigning it the pion mass. These vetoes reduce the number of B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * 0 candidates to a negligible level. Similarly,  the number of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c6pK \u2212 decays, resulting from a misidentification of a proton as a kaon, is estimated from data by assigning the proton mass to the final-state particle that has the largest probability to be a misidentified proton based on the particle-identification information. This method yields 241 \u00b1 30 \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c6pK \u2212 decays in the total data set. In order to determine the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 yield in the final data sample, the four-kaon invariant-mass distributions are fitted with the sum of the following components: a B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 signal model, which comprises the sum of a Crystal Ball [43] and a Student's t-function; the peaking background contribution modelled by a Crystal Ball function, with the shape parameters fixed to the values obtained from a fit to simulated events, and the combinatorial background component, described using an exponential function. The yield of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c6pK \u2212 peaking background contribution is fixed to the number previously stated. Once the MLP requirements are imposed, an unbinned extended maximumlikelihood fit to the four-kaon invariant mass gives a total yield of 8843\u00b1102 B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays and 2813 \u00b1 67 combinatorial background candidates in the total data set. The fits to the four-kaon invariant-mass distributions, after the selection optimised for the CP -violation measurement, separately for each data taking year, are shown in figure 1.",

The CP -violating asymmetry in B 0 s mixing, which can be characterised by the semileptonic asymmetry, a s sl is small [45]. Thus, to good approximation |q/p| = 1, and |\u03bb k | quantifies the level of CP violation in the decay. Two different fit configurations are performed, one in which the CP -violation parameters are assumed to be helicity independent and the other in which CP -violation parameters are allowed to differ as a function of helicity. The helicity independent fit assumes one CP -violating phase, \u03c6 sss s , which takes the place of all \u03c6 s,k contained in the coefficients of appendix A, and likewise one parameter that describes direct CP violation, |\u03bb|, which takes the place of all \u03bb k coefficients. Due to the small sample size, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced for the case of the helicity-dependent CPviolation fit. This involves assuming CP conservation for the case of the direct CP -violation parameters, \u03bb = 1, and also for the phase of the longitudinal polarisation, \u03c6 sss s,0 = 0. The longitudinal polarisation has been theoretically calculated as close to zero in the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay [1].",

The reason for the change in control channel is related to changes to the software-trigger selection between the two data-taking periods. The decay-time acceptances of the control modes are weighted by a multivariate algorithm based on simulated kinematic and topological information, in order to match more closely those of the signal B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay. Cubic splines are used to model the acceptance as a function of decay time in the PDF. The PDF can then be computed analytically with the inclusion of the decay-time acceptance following ref. [48]. Example decay-time acceptances are shown for the case of the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decays in figure 4. To simplify the measurement of the triple-product asymmetries, the decay-time acceptance is not applied in the fit to determine the triple-product asymmetries.

The kaon charge therefore allows for the identification of the flavour of the signal B 0 s meson. This principle is exploited by the SSK flavour-tagging algorithm [50], which is calibrated with the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decay mode. A neural network is used to select fragmentation particles, improving the flavour-tagging power quoted in the previous decay-time-dependent measurement [10].

Uncertainties due to the calibration of the flavour tagging algorithms are applied as Gaussian constraints in the decay-time-dependent fit.  where W e are the signal sPlot weights calculated using the four-kaon invariant mass as the discriminating variable.

This is accounted for by performing multiple alternative weighting schemes for the weighting procedure, based on different kinematic variables in the decay. The largest variation is then assigned as the uncertainty. Further checks are performed to verify that the angular acceptance does not depend on the way in which the event was triggered. Two sources of systematic uncertainty are considered concerning the decay-time acceptance. These are the statistical uncertainty from the spline coefficients, and also the residual disagreement between the weighted control mode and the signal decay acceptances (see section 6.2). The former is evaluated through fitting the signal data set with 30 different spline functions, whose coefficients are varied according to the corresponding uncertainties. This study is performed with the three different choices of the knot points. The RMS of the fitted parameters is then assigned as the uncertainty. The residual disagreement between the control mode and the signal mode is accounted for with a simulation-based correction. Simplified simulation is used with the corrected acceptance and then fitted with the nominal acceptance. This process is repeated and the resulting bias on the fitted parameters is used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty.",

The P -wave amplitudes are defined such that|A 0 | 2 + |A \u22a5 | 2 + |A | 2 = 1,hence only two of the three amplitudes are free parameters. This normalisation effectively means the S and SS components are measured relative to the Pwave. The polarisation-dependent fit allows for a perpendicular, parallel and longitudinal component of \u03c6 sss s and |\u03bb|. The measurement of the parameters of interest is performed through an unbinned negative log likelihood minimisation. The log-likelihood, L, of each candidate is weighted using the sPlot method [52, 53], to remove partly reconstructed and combinatorial background. The negative log-likelihood then takes the form \u2212 ln L = \u2212\u03b1 e\u2208candidates W e ln(S e TD ), (8.1)",
