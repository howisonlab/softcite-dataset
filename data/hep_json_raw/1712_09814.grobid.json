The measurement is performed in the jj final state with including electrons and muons, and the jets j corresponding to the quarks produced in the hard interaction. The measured cross section in a kinematic region defined by invariant masses m > 50 GeV, m jj > 120 GeV, and transverse momenta p Tj > 25 GeV is \u03c3 EW ( jj) = 534 \u00b1 20 (stat) \u00b1 57 (syst) fb, in agreement with leading-order standard model predictions. The final state is also used to perform a search for anomalous trilinear gauge couplings. No evidence is found and limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are given in the framework of an effective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are \u22122.6 < c W W W /\u039b 2 < 2.6 TeV \u22122 and \u22128.4 < c W /\u039b 2 < 10.1 TeV \u22122 . The additional jet activity of events in a signal-enriched region is also studied, and the measurements are in agreement with predictions.",

This production is governed by a mixture of electroweak (EW) and strong processes of order \u03b1 2 EW \u03b1 2 S , where \u03b1 S is the strong coupling and \u03b1 EW is the EW coupling strength.",

In this paper the electroweak production is referred to as EW Zjj, and the two jets produced through the fragmentation of the outgoing quarks are referred to as \"tagging jets\". Figure 1 shows representative Feynman diagrams for the EW Zjj signal, namely VBF (left), bremsstrahlung-like (center), and multiperipheral (right) production. Gauge cancellations lead to a large negative interference between the VBF process and the other two processes, with the interferences from the bremsstrahlung-like production being larger. Interference with multiperipheral production is limited to cases where the dilepton mass is close to the Z boson peak mass [2].",

The NNPDF30 (nlo_as0130) [27] parton distribution functions (PDF) are used to generate the events. The underlying event (UE) is modelled using the CUETP8M1 tune [28]. The simulation does not include extra partons at matrix element (ME) level. The signal is defined in the kinematic region with dilepton invariant mass m > 50 GeV, parton transverse momentum p Tj > 25 GeV, and diparton invariant mass m jj > 120 GeV. The cross section of the jj final state (with = e or \u03bc), applying the above fiducial cuts, is calculated to be \u03c3 LO (EW jj) = 543 +7 \u22129 (scale) \u00b1 22 (PDF) fb, where the first uncertainty is obtained by changing simultaneously the factorization (\u03bc F ) and renormalization (\u03bc R ) scales by factors of 2 and 1/2, and the second reflects the uncertainties in the NNPDF30 PDFs. The LO signal cross section and relevant kinematic distributions estimated with Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo are found to be in agreement within 5% with the next-to-leading order (NLO) predictions of the vbfnlo generator (v.2.7.1) [29][30][31] that includes NLO QCD corrections. For additional comparisons, signal events have also been simulated with the herwig++ (v2.7.1) [32] PS, using the EE5C [33] tune.",
