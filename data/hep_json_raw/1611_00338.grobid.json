The analysed data sample, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . Several kinematic variables are employed to suppress the dominant background, multijet production, as well as to discriminate between other standard model and new physics processes. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of new-physics models that yield a stable weakly interacting massive particle. The number of observed candidate events is found to agree with the expected contributions from standard model processes, and the result is interpreted in the mass parameter space of fourteen simplified supersymmetric models that assume the pair production of gluinos or squarks and a range of decay modes. For models that assume gluino pair production, masses up to 1575 and 975 GeV are excluded for gluinos and neutralinos, respectively. For models involving the pair production of top squarks and compressed mass spectra, top squark masses up to 400 GeV are excluded.",

            "text": "Experimentally, SUSY is testable through the prediction of an extensive array of new observable states (of unknown masses) [5,6]. In the minimal supersymmetric extension to e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch the SM [6], the gluinos g, light-and heavy-flavour squarks q, b, t, and sleptons are, respectively, the superpartners to gluons, quarks, and leptons. An extended Higgs sector is also predicted, as well as four neutralino \u03c7 0 1,2,3,4 and two chargino \u03c7 \u00b1 1,2 states that arise from mixing between the higgsino and gaugino states, which are the superpartners of the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons. The assumption of Rparity conservation [7] has important consequences for cosmology and collider phenomenology. Supersymmetric particles are expected to be produced in pairs at the LHC, with heavy coloured states decaying, potentially via intermediate SUSY states, to the stable lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The LSP is generally assumed to be the \u03c7 0 1 , which is weakly interacting and massive. This SUSY particle is considered to be a candidate for dark matter (DM) [8], the existence of which is supported by astrophysical data [9]. Hence, a characteristic signature of R-parity-conserving coloured SUSY production at the LHC is a final state containing an abundance of jets, possibly originating from top or bottom quarks, accompanied by a significant transverse momentum imbalance, p miss T . The proposed supersymmetric extension of the SM is also compelling from a theoretical perspective, as the addition of superpartners to SM particles can modify the running of the gauge coupling constants such that their unification can be achieved at a high energy scale [10][11][12]. A more topical perspective, given the recently discovered Higgs boson [13][14][15], is the possibility that scale-dependent radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass from loop processes can be largely cancelled through the introduction of superpartners, thus alleviating the gauge hierarchy problem [16,17]. Alternatively, these radiative corrections can be accommodated through an extreme level of fine tuning of the bare Higgs boson mass. A \"natural\" solution from SUSY, with minimal fine-tuning, implies that the masses of the \u03c7 0 1 , third-generation squarks, and the gluino are at or near the electroweak scale [18].",

Earlier searches using the same technique have been performed in pp collisions at both \u221a s = 7 [28][29][30] and 8 TeV [31,32] by the CMS Collaboration. The increase in the centre-of-mass energy of the LHC, from \u221a s = 8 to 13 TeV, provides a unique opportunity to search for the characteristic signatures of new physics at the TeV scale. For example, the increase in \u221a s leads to a factor 35 increase in the parton luminosity [33] for the pair production of coloured SUSY particles, each of mass 1.5 TeV, which were beyond the reach of searches performed at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS [34,35] (and references therein) and CMS [36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] Collaborations.

The search is based on an examination of the number of reconstructed jets per event, the number of these jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, and the scalar and vector p T sums of these jets. These variables provide sensitivity to the different production mechanisms (squark-squark, squarkgluino, and gluino-gluino) of massive coloured SUSY particles at hadron colliders, third-generation squark signatures, and both large and small mass splittings between the parent SUSY particle and the LSP. However, the search is sufficiently generic and inclusive to provide sensitivity to a wide range of SUSY and non-SUSY models that postulate the existence of a stable, only weakly interacting, massive particle. In addition to the jets+ p miss T topology, the search considers final states containing a \"monojet\" topology, which is expected to improve the sensitivity to DM particle production in pp collisions [51,52].",

The \u03c6 * min [28] variable exploits azimuthal angular information and also provides strong rejection power against multijet events, including rare energetic events in which neutrinos carry a significant fraction of the energy of a jet due to semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour mesons. Very restrictive requirements on the \u03b1 T and \u0394\u03c6 * min variables are employed in this search to ensure a low level of contamination from the multijet background.",

The bore of the solenoid is instrumented with several particle detection systems. A silicon pixel and strip tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, extend over a range |\u03b7| < 3.0. Outside the bore of the solenoid, forward calorimeters extend the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0, and muons are measured within |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gasionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A two-tier trigger system selects pp collision events of interest. The first level of the trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. The CMS detector is nearly hermetic, which allows for momentum balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam axis. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [54].",

Hence, Fig. 1 (top) demonstrates the combined performance of several variables that are employed to suppress multijet events. For both distributions, the events are recorded with a set of inclusive trigger conditions that are independent of the \u03b1 T and \u0394\u03c6 * min vari-ables. The distributions for the QCD multijet background are determined from simulation while all other SM backgrounds (vector boson production in association with jets, tt, and other residual contributions from rare SM processes) are estimated using a \u03bc + jets data control sample, described in Sect. 6.2. The contribution from multijet events is observed to fall by more than five orders of magnitude for both variables. The \u03b1 T and \u0394\u03c6 * min requirements described above, in conjunction with the common preselection requirements H miss T > 130 GeV and H miss T /E miss T < 1.25, provide strong rejection power against the multijet background for events that satisfy n jet \u2265 2. For monojet events, a modification to the \u0394\u03c6 * min variable, which considers soft jets with p T > 25 GeV (\u0394\u03c6 *  25 min ), is utilised. No \u03b1 T requirement is imposed, and \u0394\u03c6 * 25 min > 0.5 is sufficient to suppress contributions from multijet events to a negligible level.

For W boson decays that yield an electron or muon (possibly originating from leptonic \u03c4 decays), the background contributions result from events containing an e or \u03bc that are not rejected by the lepton vetoes. The veto of events containing at least one isolated track further suppresses these backgrounds, including those from single-prong \u03c4 -lepton decays. At higher jet or b-quark jet multiplicities, single top quark and tt production, followed by semileptonic top quark decay, also become an important source of background. The method to estimate the nonmultijet backgrounds in the signal region relies on the use of a transfer (T ) factor determined from simulation that is constructed per bin (in terms of n jet , n b , and H T ) per control region. Each T factor is defined as the ratio of the expected yields in the same (n jet , n b , H T ) bins of the signal region N SR MC and one of the control regions N CR MC .

The SM expectations for different n jet and n b categories exhibit a nonnegligible level of covariance within the same H T bin, primarily as a result of the systematic uncertainties evaluated from closure tests, described in Sect. 6.2, that integrate yields over n jet and n b . Bins adjacent and next-to-adjacent in n jet and/or n b can have correlation coefficients in the range 0.2-0.4, and, infrequently, as large as \u223c0.5.

The excluded region extends to higher masses for the gluino-mediated production of lightflavour squarks (T1qqqq), with respect to direct pair production when assuming an eightfold degeneracy in mass (T2qq_8fold), due to a combination of a higher gluino pair production cross section and a final state characterised by higher jet multiplicities, which are exploited to provide better signal-to-background separation. The excluded mass region is significantly reduced when assuming only a single light squark (T2qq_1fold), with limits weakening due to the lower production cross section, compounded by the reduced signal-to-background ratios achieved in the core of distributions in the discriminating variables. Figure 7 (lower) shows the exclusion contours for models that assume the gluino-mediated pair production of off-shell third-generation squarks.

The excluded mass regions differ significantly for these topologies, primarily due to the different number of (onshell) W bosons in their final states, resulting in the highest A \u03b5 for T1bbbb and lowest for T1tttt. Further, A \u03b5 has a strong dependence on jet multiplicity, which is highest for T1tttt, due to the \u0394\u03c6 1 (and hence \u03c7 0 1 ) is not highly Lorentz boosted relative to the top quark resulting from the three-body decay of the gluino. Hence, two \u03c7 0 1 SUSY particles do not carry away significant p miss T , which is instead realised through W boson decays to neutrinos and \"lost\" leptons or \u03c4 leptons that decay to neutrinos and hadrons. The observed mass limits for these topologies are up to \u223c2 standard deviations weaker than the expected limits. These differences are due to upward fluctuations in data for two contiguous bins that satisfy the requirements n jet \u2265 5, n b \u2265 2, and H T > 800 GeV. This region has the highest sensitivity to models involving gluino production and decays to third-generation quarks (via on-or offshell squarks).

The events are distributed in H miss , are less compatible with the data counts in this high-n jet , n b , and H T region.

In addition to the signal region, \u03bc + jets, \u03bc\u03bc + jets, and \u03b3 + jets control regions are included in the likelihood fit. The observed yields are found to be in agreement with the expected contributions from standard model processes. The search result is interpreted in the mass parameter space of fourteen simplified SUSY models, which cover scenarios that involve the gluino-mediated or direct production of light-or heavy-flavour squarks, intermediate SUSY particle states, as well as natural and nearly mass-degenerate spectra.",

The excluded mass regions differ significantly for the T2bb, T2tb, and T2tt topologies, in an analogous way to the T1bbbb, T1ttbb, and T1tttt models described above. The difference in the mass exclusions is due primarily to the different number of (on-shell) W bosons in the final states, which affects A \u03b5 through the presence of leptons from the decay of the W boson.
