Diboson resonances with masses in the range from 1.3 to 3.0 TeV are sought after using the invariant mass distribution of dijets where both jets are tagged as a boson jet, compatible with a highly boosted W or Z boson decaying to quarks, using jet mass and substructure properties. The largest deviation from a smoothly falling background in the observed dijet invariant mass distribution occurs around 2 TeV in the W Z channel, with a global significance of 2.5 standard deviations. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching ratio for the W Z final state of a new heavy gauge boson, W , and for the W W and ZZ final states of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton in a bulk Randall-Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass. W bosons with couplings predicted by the extended gauge model in the mass range from 1.3 to 1.5 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

This paper presents a search for narrow diboson resonances (W W , W Z and ZZ) decaying to fully hadronic final states. The fully hadronic mode has a higher branching fraction than leptonic and semileptonic decay modes, and is therefore used to extend the reach of the search to the highest possible resonance masses.",

The W is required to decay to a W and a Z boson, which are both forced to decay hadronically. The cross section times branching ratio as well as the resonance width for the samples listed in table 1 are calculated by Pythia 8 assuming EGM couplings [12] for the W . In particular, the W coupling to W Z is equal to that of the W coupling scaled by c \u00d7 (m W /m W ) 2 , where c is a coupling scaling factor of order one which is set to unity for the samples generated here. The partial -3 - width of W \u2192 W Z decays thus scales linearly with m W , leading to a narrow width over the entire accessible mass range. Because of the anti-quark parton distribution functions involved in the production, a significant part of the W cross section for large W masses is due to off-shell interactions which produce a low-mass tail in the W mass spectrum. The relative size of the low-mass tail increases with the W mass: the fraction of events with a diboson mass below 20% of the pole mass of the W increases from 10% for m W = 1.3 TeV to 22% for m W = 2.0 TeV and to 65% for m W = 3.0 TeV. An extended RS model with a warped extra dimension is used for the excited graviton benchmarks. In this model the SM fields are allowed to propagate in the warped extra dimension [16], avoiding the constraints on the original RS model from limits on flavour-changing neutral currents and electroweak precision measurements. The model is characterised by a dimensionless coupling constant k/M Pl \u223c 1, where k is the curvature of the warped extra dimension andM Pl is the reduced Planck mass. The RS excited graviton samples are generated with CalcHEP 3.4 [33] setting k/M Pl = 1, covering the resonance mass range 1.3 \u2264 m G RS \u2264 3.0 TeV in 100 GeV intervals. The graviton resonance is decayed to W W or ZZ, and the resulting W or Z bosons are forced to decay hadronically. The cross section times branching ratio as well as the resonance width calculated by CalcHEP for the RS model are listed in table 1. Events are generated using CTEQ6L1 [34] PDFs, and use Pythia 8 for the parton shower and hadronisation.",

To improve the discrimination in this analysis, the remaining jets are also tagged with three additional boson tagging requirements. First, a more stringent subjet momentumbalance criterion ( \u221a y \u2265 0.45) is applied to the pair of subjets identified by the filtering algorithm at the stopping point before the reclustering stage, since jets in QCD dijet events that survive grooming tend to have unbalanced subjet momenta characteristic of soft gluon radiation. Figure 1a shows the subjet momentum-balance distribution for jets in signal and QCD dijet background simulated events. Unlike jets from massive boson decays in which the hadron multiplicity is essentially independent of the jet p T , energetic gluon jets are  typically composed of more hadrons, so the number of charged-particle tracks associated with the original, ungroomed jet is required to be small (n trk < 30). Figure 1b shows the number of tracks matched to jets for selected jets in signal and background simulated events. The efficiency of this selection requirement must be corrected by a scale factor derived from data, as explained in section 7. Finally, a selection window is applied to the invariant mass of the filtered jet, m j , since this quantity is expected to be small for jets in QCD dijet events and to reflect the boson mass for jets from hadronic boson decays. The expected mass distribution of jets in G RS simulated events and the dijet background simulation is illustrated in figure 1c. Narrow mass windows with a width of 26 GeV are chosen to optimise sensitivity to signal events and are centred at either 82. ",

The two jets with the highest transverse momentum must have |\u03b7| < 2.0 to ensure sufficient overlap with the inner tracking detector, since associated charged-particle tracks are used in the boson tagging requirements and for estimating systematic uncertainties. In addition, a requirement on the rapidity difference between the two leading jets, |y 1 \u2212 y 2 | < 1.2, is imposed to improve the sensitivity. This rapidity difference is smaller for s-channel processes such as the W and G RS signal models than for the t-channel processes dominating the QCD dijet background. The combined efficiency of these three cuts in W signal events is between 72% and 81% depending on the resonance mass, for events from each signal sample in which the true diboson mass lies within 10% of the nominal value. For G RS signal events, the combined efficiency is between 82% and 87%. The difference in the expected efficiencies between the W and G RS signals is related to the different event topologies expected for spin-1 and spin-2 resonances affecting acceptance.",

Figure 3 shows fits to the Herwig++ and Pythia simulated dijet events that pass the full event selection and tagging requirements on both jets, where the predictions from these leading-order generators are corrected by reweighting the untagged leading-jet p T distributions to match the untagged distribution in data. Figure 4 shows the results of fitting the dijet mass spectrum before tagging, and in otherwise tagged events where both the leading and subleading jet have masses falling below the boson-tagging mass windows, in the range 40 < m j < 60 GeV. For the data selected before boson tagging, the trigger efficiency as a function of the dijet mass is taken into account in the fit, because in the untagged jet sample the trigger is not fully efficient in the first dijet mass bin displayed. The fitted background functions in figures 3 and 4 are integrated over the same bins used to display the data, and labelled \"background model\" in the figures. The size of the shaded band reflects the uncertainties of the fit parameters. In figure 4a the background model is shown, but the size of the uncertainty band is too small to be seen. The lower insets in the figures show the significance, defined as the signed z-value of the difference between the distribution being modelled and the background model's prediction [49]. The significance with respect to the maximum-likelihood expectation is displayed in red, and the significance when taking the uncertainties on the fit parameters into account is shown in blue. Table 3 summarises the results of these fits, as well as fits to data where one jet mass falls in the low-mass sideband (40 < m j \u2264 60 GeV) and the other falls in a high-mass sideband from 110 < m j < 140 GeV, and where both jet masses fall in the high-mass sideband.

The jet p T resolution in the simulation is 5% in this kinematic region, and a 20% systematic uncertainty on this resolution is implemented by applying a multiplicative smearing factor, r E , to the p T of each reconstructed jet with a mean value of unity and a width |\u03c3 r E |. The nuisance parameter \u03c3 r E represents the uncertainty in the p T resolution - The n trk variable is not modelled sufficiently well in simulation [50], so it is necessary to apply a scale factor to the simulated signal to correct the selection efficiency of the n trk requirement. A scale factor of 0.90\u00b10.08 is derived from the ratio of the selection efficiency of this cut in a data control region enriched with W/Z + jets events, where a high-p T W or Z boson decays hadronically, to the selection efficiency of this cut in simulation. The data control region is defined by selecting events in the kinematic range where the jet trigger used in the search is fully efficient, and where only the leading-p T jet passes the tagging requirement on \u221a y. Fits to the jet mass spectrum of the leading-p T jet determine the number of hadronically decaying W and Z bosons reconstructed as a single jet that pass the n trk requirement as a function of the selection criteria on n trk . The dominant uncertainty on these yields is the mismodelling of the jet mass spectrum for non-W or non-Z jets, and is evaluated by comparing the yields obtained when using two different background models in the fit. The resulting scale factor is 0.90 \u00b1 0.08. Since the n trk requirement is applied twice per event in the selections used in the search, a scale factor of 0.8 is applied per selected signal event, with an associated uncertainty of 20%. A 5% uncertainty on the signal efficiency due to uncertainties on the parton shower and hadronisation model is also included. The uncertainty is estimated by comparing the selection efficiencies obtained in simulated signal samples generated and showered with Pythia 8 to the selection efficiencies obtained in samples generated with Pythia 8 and showered with Herwig++. An additional 3.5% uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to uncertainties on the PDFs is considered. This uncertainty is estimated according to the PDF4LHC recommendations [51]. Table 4 summarises the systematic uncertainties affecting the signal shape and the pdf constraining the associated nuisance parameter. The largest uncertainty on the shape of the reconstructed signal is due to the jet p T scale and resolution; the uncertainty in the scale introduces an uncertainty on the scale of the mass of the reconstructed resonant signal, and the resolution introduces an uncertainty of the width. The jet mass scale uncertainty also has an effect on the scale of the reconstructed mass, but this effect is less significant. Table 5 summarises the systematic uncertainties affecting the signal normalisation. The jet mass scale uncertainty affects both the shape and the normalisation.",

In this figure, the fitted background functions, labelled \"background model\", are again integrated over the same bins used to display the data, and the size of the shaded band reflects the uncertainties on the parameters propagated to show the uncertainty on the expectation from the fit. Figure 5 also displays the fitted dijet mass distribution of events passing any of the three tagging selections. The lower panels in the figure show the significance of the difference between data and the expectation in each bin. Table 6 gives the fitted values of the parameters for the data selected before tagging, displayed in figure 4a, and after the W Z, W W and ZZ selections, as well as the number of events observed. The dijet mass distributions after all three tagging selections are well-described by the background model over the entire mass range explored, with the exception of a few bins near m jj = 2 TeV which contain more events than predicted by the background model. Approximately 20% of the events selected by either the W W , W Z, or ZZ selection are shared among all three signal regions. The fraction of events common to the W Z and the W W or the W Z and the ZZ selections are 49% and 43% respectively. After requiring that m jj > 1.75 TeV, 5 out of 25 events are common to all three signal regions. The statistical interpretation of these dijet mass distributions is discussed in the following section.  Figure 5. Background-only fits to the dijet mass (m jj ) distributions in data (a) after tagging with the W Z selection, (b) after tagging with the W W selection, (c) after tagging with the ZZ selection, and (d) for events passing any of the three tagging selections. The significance shown in the inset for each bin is the difference between the data and the fit in units of the uncertainty on this difference. The significance with respect to the maximum-likelihood expectation is displayed in red, and the significance when taking the uncertainties on the fit parameters into account is shown in blue. The spectra in the three signal regions are compared to the signals expected for an EGM W with m W = 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 TeV or to an RS graviton with m GRS = 1.5 or 2.0 TeV.",
