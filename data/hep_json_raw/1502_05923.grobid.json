These differential cross-sections are presented in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 . The differential cross-sections are presented in terms of kinematic variables, such as momentum, rapidity and invariant mass, of a top-quark proxy referred to as the pseudo-top-quark as well as the pseudo-top-quark pair system. The dependence of the measurement on theoretical models is minimal. The measurements are performed on tt events in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one charged lepton and at least four jets with at least two of them tagged as originating from a b-quark. The hadronic and leptonic pseudo-top-quarks are defined via the leptonic or hadronic decay mode of the W boson produced by the top-quark decay in events with a single charged lepton. Differential cross-section measurements of the pseudo-top-quark variables are compared with several Monte Carlo models that implement next-to-leading order or leading-order multi-leg matrix-element calculations.",

Hence there are three tt signatures that correspond to different decay modes of the W bosons. The signal for this study is in the single-lepton channel. It corresponds to the case where one W boson decays directly, or via an intermediate \u03c4 decay, into an electron or muon and at least one neutrino, and the other into a pair of quarks. The neutrino(s) will escape the detector unseen, leading to missing transverse momentum whose magnitude is denoted by E miss T . The model dependence tt differential cross section measurements presented at the level of top quarks, i.e. corrected for parton shower effects and hadronisation, has been an ongoing concern. This paper presents differential tt cross-section measurements using a definition where the variables are constructed from an object that is directly related to detectorlevel observables. This top-quark proxy object is referred to as the pseudo-top-quark (t). The goal of presenting measurements using a definition where the variables are constructed from reconstructed charged lepton, jet and missing transverse momentum objects, is to allow precision tests of QCD in final states with top-quarks, using reconstructed objects that avoid large model-dependent extrapolation corrections to the parton-level top-quark but remain well correlated with corresponding objects reconstructed from the partons.",

Observables based on stable particles can be unambiguously compared to MC generator predictions and therefore provide useful benchmarks to test and further develop MC models and to adjust free model parameters.",

The use of particlebased definitions in cross-section measurements is a standard methodology in high-energy physics [25,26] to reduce the model dependence. Standardised tools exist to compare theory predictions for such measurements [27][28][29]. In tt events, such measurements were published for the inclusive cross-section [3, 4] and for differential cross-section measurements as a function of the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the final-state leptons and jets [17,[30][31][32]. In this paper the concept of the particle-based cross-section definition is extended to the kinematic properties of the top-quark decay products that when correctly combined are closely related to the kinematic properties of the top-quark. An operational definitiont that is defined from measured observables as described below has been introduced to reduce the model dependence of the measurements. 1 This operational definition should result in a good correlation between thet object and the top parton for a given Monte Carlo generator. However, it is not necessary that the algorithms lead to the best possible correlation to the parton-level kinematics or the best signal to background ratio.",

The larger phase space of the parton-level distribution results in a softer p T distribution when compared with the pseudo-top-quark distribution where fiducial cuts are applied. In addition, with increasing p T , the decay products tend to be more collimated due to their large boost resulting in a reduced pseudo-top reconstruction efficiency. Using the same Monte Carlo sample, figure 2(a) shows the correlation between the generated parton-level p T distribution and the particle-level hadronic pseudo-top-quark p T . About 50% of the events show a strong correlation between the top quark parton and the particle-levelt h . These are the cases where the correct combination of the final state object was found to reconstruct the particle-levelt h . Despite the good correlation, there remains a significant bin migration in the region populated by the majority of top-quarks. These migrations can be affected by a change in the modelling of tt production. This makes any measurement extrapolated to the JHEP06(2015)100 Simulated event distribution of the parton-level top-quark p T distribution for all events (green), and the particle-level pseudo-top-quark p T (t h ) for events within the fiducial region (blue). In both cases the top-quark that decays hadronically is chosen. The distributions are evaluated for the same event sample based on powheg+pythia at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The upper figure is made for an arbitrary integrated luminosity. The lower figure shows the ratio of the particle-level t h over the parton-level top-quark normalised distributions to emphasise the difference in shape between the two. parton level model-dependent. However, there is a much stronger correlation between the the hadronic particle-level and detector-level pseudo-top-quark p T distributions as shown in figure 2(b).

These samples are referred to as alpgen+pythia(\u03b1 S Up) and alpgen+pythia(\u03b1 S Down), respectively. The selected \u03b1 S values are found to produce variations that are similar to the uncertainty band of crosssection measurements for tt events with additional jet activity, as described in ref.

The resulting data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59 \u00b1 0.08 fb \u22121 [72]. During this period, the LHC delivered instantaneous luminosities that were sufficient to produce several pp interactions within the same bunch crossing (in-time pile-up).

The mean number of in-time pile-up interactions, \u00b5 , was measured by averaging over all pp bunch crossings in a given luminosity block.

The normalisation was separately obtained for each of the MC systematic uncertainty evaluations listed in section 6. The normalisation of the heavy-flavour fractions within the W +jets sample was determined by measuring the number of W +2-jet events, without a b-tagging requirement and with the requirement of at least one b-tag. To make this measurement, the charge asymmetry technique described above was applied to both sets of selected events. The number of events that have one or more b-tags is related to the number of events before the b-tagging requirement, the b-tagging probability and the flavour fractions in the W+jets sample. The simulated fractions for the heavy-flavour processes (W bb+jets, W cc+jets and W c+jets) are determined with the ratio W cc/W bb taken from simulation. The measurement used the number of events after requiring at least one b-tag where the overall normalisation of W +jets events was fixed using the values previously determined by the charge asymmetry method. The heavy-flavour fractions are then extrapolated from the W +2-jet selection to W+ \u2265 4-jet events using the heavy-flavour fractions from the MC simulation.

Additional sources of the JES uncertainty are also estimated. The main contributions are the intercalibration of the forward region detector response from the central regions of the detector, effects from the correction of additional pp interactions, jet flavour composition, b-jet JES calibration and the presence of close-by jets. Uncertainties due to different detector-simulation configurations used in the analysis and in the calibration are added as one additional uncertainty parameter (\"relative non-closure\").

Similar studies are also performed for the lepton energy and momentum scales and resolutions. Since the two channels require different lepton flavours, the electron uncertainty affects only the electron channel, and similarly for the muon channel. The electron uncertainty is approximately double the muon uncertainty. In both cases the uncertainty is small with little variation between bins. The uncertainty on E miss T is determined by propagating all the uncertainties associated with the energy scales and resolutions for leptons and jets to the calculation of E miss T . Two additional uncertainties that are included originate from the calorimeter cells not associated with any physics objects and the pile-up modelling. The systematic uncertainties associated with tagging jets originating from b-quarks are separated into three categories. These are the efficiency of the tagging algorithm (b-quark tagging efficiency), the efficiency with which jets originating from c-quarks pass the btag requirement (c-quark tagging efficiency) and the rate at which light-flavour jets are tagged (misidentified tagging efficiency factors used to correct the differences between simulation and data in each of the categories. The uncertainties in the simulation modelling of the b-tagging performance are assessed by studying b-jets in dileptonic tt events [88]. The b-tagging efficiency is another major contributor to the overall systematic uncertainty and tends to slightly increase with p T . The c-quark efficiency uncertainty is approximately constant at \u2248 2% while the misidentification uncertainty contributes at the percent level for all distributions.",

To ensure a one-to-one relationship between the particle-level and the detector-level observables, the response matrix is constructed from events where for each detector-level pseudo-top-quark object a particle-level pseudo-top-quark object can be matched. The matching is based on the angular differences between the components of the pseudo-top-quarks. Detector-level and particle-level jets (jet/jet \u2032 ) and leptons (\u2113/\u2113 \u2032 ) are considered matched if they satisfy \u2206R(jet, jet \u2032 ) < 0.35 and \u2206R(\u2113, \u2113 \u2032 ) < 0.02.

The distributions provide complementary information and show some sensitivity to the selected PDF set, the parton shower procedure, and to a lesser extent the matrix element and parton shower matching scheme. The larger acceptance for the alpgen MC models resulted in an excess of events reconstructed within the fiducial region. The higher \u03b1 S variation is seen to be disfavoured at higher p T (t lth ) and m(t lth ) values. Among the several tt MC models used, the powheg(herapdf)+pythia sample provides the best representation for all of the distributions, except for low m(t lth ) where many of the MC models predict a higher cross-section than the data at low mass values. The mc@nlo prediction is seen to produce a recoil distribution that is too soft with respect to the data. These measurements are currently limited by the systematic uncertainty, the main components being the b-tagging uncertainty, the jet energy measurement uncertainty and the modelling uncertainty of the initial and final state parton showers.",
