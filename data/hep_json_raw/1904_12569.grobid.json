It is interesting that these measurements are not just limited to small (forward) angles, but in particular cover also low-p T , exclusive final states and in particular minimum bias results. The type of measurements discussed here cover up to 14 orders of magnitude in cross section, ranging from very rare exclusive W + W \u2212 pair production in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s =8 TeV with a cross section on the order of O(10 fb) up to the inclusive cross section in proton-lead collisions at \u221a s NN =5.02 TeV on the order of O(barn). Some of the measurements described have a relation to very high energy cosmic ray interactions and can be of use to further improve the understanding of the modelling of those.",
