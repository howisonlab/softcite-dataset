            "text": "Precision spectroscopy of the Muonium Lamb shift and fine structure requires a robust source of 2S Muonium. To date, the beam-foil technique is the only demonstrated method for creating such a beam in vacuum. Previous experiments using this technique were statistics limited, and new measurements would benefit tremendously from the efficient 2S production at a low energy muon (< 20 keV) facility. Such a source of abundant low energy \u03bc + has only become available in recent years, e.g. at the Low-Energy Muon beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Using this source, we report on the successful creation of an intense, directed beam of metastable Muonium. We find that even though the theoretical Muonium fraction is maximal in the low energy range of 2-5 keV, scattering by the foil and transport characteristics of the beamline favor slightly higher \u03bc + energies of 7-10 keV. We estimate that an event detection rate of a few events per second for a future Lamb shift measurement is feasible, enabling an increase in precision by two orders of magnitude over previous determinations.",

Therefore, and in contrast to hydrogen, theory and experiment with M can be compared free of finite-size and nuclear effects [1]. Testing bound state quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the muonic sector is highly motivated by the inconsistencies which have arisen there, e.g. the deviation of the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from its theoretical value [2], and the difference between the proton radius as measured by laser spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen [3] and several experiments in electronic hydrogen [4][5][6]. However, the puzzle is arguably nearing its solution [7][8][9]. a e-mail: crivelli@phys.ethz.ch (corresponding author)",

            "text": "To this day, precision experiments with M only utilized its ground-state [10,11]. The 1S-2S transition was measured by pulsed laser spectroscopy [12,13], putting tight bounds on the muon-electron charge ratio. A future precision measurement using a CW laser is planned by the Mu-MASS experiment [14]. The measurement of the ground-state hyperfine structure currently determines the muon magnetic moment with the highest precision [15], with an improvement underway by the MUSEUM collaboration [16,17]. However, the methods used for M production in these measurements do not produce sufficient M(2S) in vacuum, and so cannot be used to study transitions from long-lived excited states. These include the n = 2 Lamb shift [18,19] and fine-structure [20], which were measured previously in M. Other transitions probed in hydrogen with fast beams may be considered as well [21][22][23][24]. Similar to hydrogen, metastable M can be formed with the beamfoil technique [25], and indeed M(2S) was first observed at the TRIUMF cyclotron accelerator using sub-surface \u03bc + at 2.1 MeV, impinging on gold and aluminum foils [26], followed by an observation at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) [27]. In the Born approximation, production of M with this beam-foil technique is expected to be comparable to hydrogen with protons at the same velocity [28], favouring energies of several keV [29,30]. For this reason, the TRIUMF and LAMPF muon beams had to be significantly lowered in energy by degrader foils with the price of losing roughly half of the beam intensity. This resulted in a wide angular distribution for the emitted M [31]. The broad energy distribution of the degraded muon beam, extending from keVs to MeVs, resulted in a wide M energy distribution peaking at low energy and extending up to 20 keV, which severely limited the overall M yield.",

In this communication, we report on the efficient creation and detection of a nearly collinear M(2S) beam by the beam-foil technique. Employing the slow \u03bc + from the Low-Energy-Muon (LEM) beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) [33,34] with energies < 10 keV allowed us to directly use a thin (\u223c 15 nm) carbon foil as a conversion target without the necessity of any prior beam degradation. By tagging each muon and measuring its time-of-flight (TOF), we report for the first time the M creation efficiency over well-defined exit energies ranging from 2 to 8 keV. Through quenching the metastable 2S state to the short-lived 2P state in a static electric field and detecting the emitted Lyman-\u03b1 photons, we extract the 2S fraction and compare with estimation from the literature. Combining our results with particle tracing simulations, we were able to quantify the M(2S) beam parameters. These parameters enable a realistic estimation of the achievable event rate for a future Lamb shift measurement.

The field at the center is 400 V/cm. Unlike the metastable 2S state, the 2P state is shortlived (\u03c4 2P \u2248 1.6 ns) and relaxes to the ground state within a few nanoseconds, emitting a photon of 122 nm (Ly-\u03b1). This photon can be detected by four CsI-coated MCPs (Ly\u03b1-MCP) surrounding the quenching area. The beam exiting the quenching region, now containing predominantly M(1S) and \u03bc + , reaches a rejection electrode at high voltage (E inc + 1 kV) that only allows passage of M(1S) by blocking \u03bc + . The surviving M(1S) impinge onto an MCP (Stop-MCP), providing the stop signal. An extension stage can be added between the carbon foil and the quenching region to extend the travelling distance. The resulting increase in TOF allows the extraction of the velocity and thus energy distributions of both \u03bc + and M after the foil, which are not known a priori. Additionally, the extension stage ensures that all 2P states, as well as higher lying states produced in the foil [42], decay prior to reaching the quenching region. For 10 keV incident \u03bc + , the spectra were measured with and without the extension stage (Fig. 3).",

We find that a thickness of 15 nm is most probable, which is more than the 10 nm specified by the manufacturer. This fact is not surprising considering the differences between the nominal and derived carbon foil thicknesses determined in [43]. From our knowledge of the M fractions and residual energy distributions, we can determine the M conversion rate of our foil in this low incident muon energy range. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The errors in the fractions are dominated by statistics, and those in the mean residual energy are correlated and arise from the uncertainty of t 0 .

The quenching and geometrical efficiency of the Ly-\u03b1 detection stage are correlated, and depend on the M velocity, since the position the M(2S) reaches before quenching affects the solid Fig. 7 Results of Monte-Carlo simulation for the quenching and geometrical efficiency as a function of energy. The inset portrays a simulated valid event where M(2S) enters the detection region, is quenched by the static field created by the two circular electrodes, and emits a photon which reached one of the detectors angle. To determine \u03b5 QG , we performed a full 3D Monte-Carlo simulation of the particle motion and photon emission inside the static electric field using the SIMION 8.1 package [44]. The position distribution of the particles at the detector entrance was taken from the GEANT4 beamline simulation with the calibrated foil thickness, taking into account the coincidence detection in the Stop-MCP. Additionally, the anisotropy of the photon emission relative to the electric field direction [45], and the transparency of the grids on the detectors, were included. The total efficiency is shown in Fig. 7. Folding it with the measured energy distributions, we get \u03b5 QG = 36.4 \u00b1 0.3% and \u03b5 QG = 37.0 \u00b1 0.3%, for E inc of 7.5 and 10 keV, respectively. The MCP detection efficiency for Ly-\u03b1 can be estimated through \u03b5 MCP = OAR \u2022 \u03b5 CsI , where OAR stands for the openarea-ratio of the MCP itself and is 0.45 in our case. The quantum yield of the conversion from Ly-\u03b1 to an electron in the CsI, \u03b5 CsI , is in the range of 0.45 \u2212 0.55 [46,47]. This leads to \u03b5 MCP = 0.22 \u00b1 0.02. The f 2S/M values, calculated according to Eq. 1, are summarized in Table 1 for E inc of 7.5 and 10 keV. Stronger scattering of the muon beam by the foil at 5 keV E inc prevented us from obtaining the reliable triplecoincidence signal needed to extract the 2S fraction. Assuming, in accordance with hydrogen in a comparable velocity range (see Fig. 3.1 of [32]), that the 2S fraction is nearly constant above 1 keV, we obtain a weighted average value of f 2S/M = 10 \u00b1 2%. This value agrees with estimations in the literature which span 10-13% in this energy range [18,26,32]. moderated \u03bc + emerging was 18 kHz. Using the LEM beamline simulation [39,40], with the same conditions as in our experiment, we estimate the rate of \u03bc + passing the foil, R \u03bc + , for each E inc . The rate of metastable M is obtained by multiplying with the measured formation efficiencies,",

Nevertheless, the angular distribution of the beam emerging from the foil at 10 keV is narrower, thus, the transmission of the beamline increases, such that the final metastable rates are comparable. Therefore, we concentrate on this energy for considering the rates available for future experiments. In Fig. 1, the main missing component for precision spectroscopy experiments of the Muonium Lamb shift and fine structure is a broadband microwave apparatus that we would place in the extension stage. By mixing the population with the 2P states, this could then resonantly quench the 2S beam. In this 'opt-out' scheme, the Ly-\u03b1 signal decreases near to the resonance.",

Based on minor improvements to the setup presented here, the expected rate of detected M(2S) states will be 8/s. This is four orders of magnitude larger than the rate of 5/h measured at TRIUMF [48], and 4/h at LAMPF [27].

With an estimation of the \u03bc + rate as well as the measurement of the neutral and 2S fractions (see Table 1), we determined a conversion rate of (3 \u00b1 1)% M(2S) per incoming \u03bc + at 10 keV. This opens up the possibility to conduct precision measurements of laser and microwave transitions from the M(2S) state. For a measurement of the n = 2 Lamb shift, arguably the most promising of these transitions, an uncertainty on the order of 100 kHz is projected, which constitutes an improvement by two orders of magnitude over the best determination from the literature [18].",
