The underlying event is characterised through measurements of the average value of the sum of the transverse energy at large pseudorapidity downstream of one of the protons, which are reported here as a function of hard-scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering is characterised by the average transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the two highest transverse momentum jets in the event. The dijet kinematics are used to estimate, on an event-by-event basis, the scaled longitudinal momenta of the hard-scattered partons in the target and projectile beam-protons moving toward and away from the region measuring transverse energy, respectively. Transverse energy production at large pseudorapidity is observed to decrease with a linear dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton and to depend only weakly on that in the projectile proton. The results are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, which qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in data but generally underpredict the overall level of transverse energy at forward pseudorapidity.",

Previous studies of the underlying event mainly focused on probing the region transverse to final-state jets at mid-rapidity [1][2][3][4]. This Letter presents a study of the transverse energy produced at small angles with respect to the proton beam, a region where particle production may be particularly sensitive to the colour connections between the hard partons and the beam remnants. Such measurements are needed to constrain particle production models, which systematically underpredict the total transverse energy at forward rapidities in hard-scattering events [4].",

The recent results found that single and dijet production rates in the proton-going (forward, or projectile) direction are related to the underlying-event activity in the nucleus-going (backward, or target) direction in a way that contradicts the models of how jet and underlying-event production should correlate. Specifically, the average transverse energy produced in the backward direction was found to systematically decrease, relative to that for low-energy jet events, with increasing jet energy. This decrease resulted in an apparent enhancement of the jet rate in low-activity, or peripheral, events and a suppression of the jet rate in high-activity, or central, events.",

Alternatively, other authors have argued that in the constituent nucleon-nucleon (N N) collisions, energy production at backward rapidities naturally decreases with increasing x in the forward-going proton, either through the suppression of soft gluons available for particle production [8] or from a rapidity-separated energy-momentum conservation be-tween the hard process and soft production [9]. More generally, the modification of soft particle production in N N collisions in the presence of a hard process is expected to affect estimates of the collision geometry of p + Pb collisions with a hard scatter [10][11][12].",

The top panel in Fig. 1 shows the convention used in p + Pb collisions at ATLAS, in which the proton beam is the \"projectile\" and has positive rapidity, while the nuclear beam is the \"target\" and has negative rapidity. The centrality of the p + Pb collision, an experimental quantity sensitive to the collision geometry, is characterised by the E T in the forward calorimeter situated in the nucleus-going direction.

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). reported in this Letter, in which the proton beam with positive rapidity is considered to be the analogue of the projectile proton in p + Pb collisions, while the target proton with negative rapidity is the analogue of a single nucleon within the Pb nucleus, and the E T is measured in the forward calorimeter downstream of the target proton. Due to the symmetric nature of pp collisions, each event can also be interpreted by exchanging the roles of the target and projectile between the two protons, and measuring the E T in the opposite forward calorimeter module. To keep the same convention in this case, the z-axis (and thus the pseudorapidity) is inverted and the kinematic variables are determined within this new coordinate system as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. The full analysis was performed separately using each forward calorimeter side, one at a time, and the final results were obtained by averaging the E T measurements from each side. This increased the number of E T measurements by a factor of two and also provided an important cross-check on the detector energy scale. For simplicity, all \u03b7 values in the selection cuts and \u03b7 dijet values in the results described below are always presented according to the convention where E T is measured at negative pseudorapidity.",

The forward calorimeter is composed of two modules situated at opposite sides of the interaction region and provides the E T measurement. The modules consist of tungsten and copper absorbers with LAr as the active medium, which together provide ten interaction lengths of material, and are segmented into one electromagnetic and two hadronic sections longitudinal in the shower direction. The 1782 cells in each forward calorimeter module are aligned parallel to the beam axis and therefore are not projective, but have a segmentation corresponding to approximately 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 in \u03b7 and \u03c6.",

Three MC programs were used to generate event samples with the leading-jet p T in the range from 20 GeV to 1 TeV: the Pythia 6 generator [19] with parameter values chosen to reproduce data according to the AUET2B set of tuned parameters (tune) [20] and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution function (PDF) set [21]; the Pythia 8 generator [22] with the AU2 tune [23] and CT10 PDF set [24]; and the Herwig++ generator [25] with the UE-EE-3 tune [26] and CTEQ6L1 PDF set.

The results have a number of implications. They demonstrate that the average level of transverse energy production at large pseudorapidity is sensitive mainly to the Bjorken-x of the parton originating in the beam-proton which is headed towards the energy-measuring region, and is largely insensitive to x in the other proton. Specifically, the decrease in the mean transverse energy downstream of a beam-proton is approximately linear in the longitudinal energy carried away from that beam-proton in the hard scattering. Monte Carlo event generators generally underpredict the overall value of the transverse energy but properly model with varying accuracy the trend in how this quantity depends on hard-scattering kinematics. These results provide counter-evidence to claims that the observed centrality-dependence of the jet rate in p + Pb collisions simply arises from the suppression of transverse energy production at negative rapidity in the hard-scattered N N sub-collision. In the p + Pb data, the deviations from the expected centrality dependence are observed to depend only on, and increase with, x in the proton. Therefore, for this effect to be consistent with arising from a feature of N N collisions, transverse energy production at small angles should decrease strongly and continuously with increasing x in the proton headed in the opposite direction (corresponding to x proj in this measurement). The results presented in this Letter do not obviously support such a scenario.",
