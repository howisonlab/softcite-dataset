A sample of 4919 candidates with 4.9% background contamination allows the determination of the branching ratio in the full kinematic region, B R(K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) = (4.24 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u22126 . The study of the kinematic space shows evidence for a structure dependent contribution in agreement with predictions based on chiral perturbation theory. Several P-and CP-violating asymmetries are also evaluated.",
