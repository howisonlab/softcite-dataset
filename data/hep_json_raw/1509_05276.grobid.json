The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 collected by the ATLAS detector in 2012 at the LHC. Final states with two, three or four leptons are considered. A fit to the data considering the ttW and ttZ processes simultaneously yields a significance of 5.0\u03c3 (4.2\u03c3) over the background-only hypothesis for ttW (ttZ) production. The measured cross sections are \u03c3 ttW = 369 +100 \u221291 fb and \u03c3 ttZ = 176 +58 \u221252 fb. The background-only hypothesis with neither ttW nor ttZ production is excluded at 7.1\u03c3. All measurements are consistent with next-to-leading-order calculations for the ttW and ttZ processes.",

Despite the fact that the top quark was discovered two decades ago [1,2] some of its properties, in particular, its coupling to the Z boson, have never been directly measured. Several extensions of the Standard Model, such as technicolour [3][4][5][6][7] or other scenarios with a strongly coupled Higgs sector [8] modify the top quark couplings.",

Measurements of the ttZ, tt\u03b3 and ttH processes provide a means of directly determining top quark couplings to bosons [9][10][11], while the ttW process is a Standard Model (SM) source of same-sign dilepton events, which are a signature of many JHEP11(2015)172 models of physics beyond the SM. Example leading-order Feynman diagrams for ttW and ttZ production at the LHC are shown in figure 1.

Depending on the decays of the top quarks, W and Z bosons, between zero and four prompt, isolated leptons 1 may be produced. Channels with two (both with same-sign and opposite-sign charge), three, and four leptons are considered in this analysis. The opposite-sign (OS) dilepton, trilepton and tetralepton channels are mostly sensitive to ttZ production, while the same-sign (SS) dilepton channel targets ttW production. Table 1 lists the analysis channels and the targeted decay modes of the ttW and ttZ processes. Each channel is divided into multiple analysis regions in order to enhance the sensitivity to the signal. A simultaneous fit is performed to all signal regions and selected control regions in the four channels to extract cross sections for ttW and ttZ production.",

Prior to jet finding, a local cluster calibration scheme [62,63] is applied to correct the topological cluster energies for the effects of non-compensating calorimeter response, dead material and out-of-cluster leakage. The jets are calibrated to restore the jet energy scale to that of jets reconstructed from stable simulated particles, using energy-and \u03b7-dependent calibration factors derived from simulations. Additional corrections to account for residual differences between simulation and data are applied [64]. After calibration, jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To avoid selecting jets from pile-up interactions, an additional requirement, referred to as the jet vertex fraction criterion (JVF), is imposed on jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. It requires that at least 50% of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of tracks with p T > 1 GeV, associated with a jet, comes from tracks compatible with originating from the primary vertex. During jet reconstruction, no distinction is made between identified electrons and jet energy deposits. Therefore, if any of the jets lie within \u2206R = 0.2 from an electron, the closest jet is discarded in order to avoid double counting of electrons as jets. After this overlap removal, electrons and muons which lie within \u2206R = 0.4 from any remaining jet are removed.",

This requirement on E miss T is relaxed by 40 GeV for the 4 -SF-2b region. The impact of events with fake leptons decreases with the number of reconstructed b-tagged jets. To suppress these backgrounds, additional requirements on the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the third and fourth leptons (p T34 ) are imposed in the lower b-tag multiplicity regions. In the 4 -SF-1b, 4 -DF-1b and 4 -DF-0b regions events are required to satisfy p T34 > 25 GeV, p T34 > 35 GeV and p T34 > 45 GeV, respectively. In the 4 -DF-0b region the requirement on the fourth lepton is raised to p T > 10 GeV and at least two jets must be reconstructed in the event. In all regions, the invariant mass of any two reconstructed OS leptons is required to be larger than 10 GeV. The definitions of the signal regions are summarised in table 6.",
