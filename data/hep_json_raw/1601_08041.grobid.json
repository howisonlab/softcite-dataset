Prof. McDonald's study was identifying the transformation of the flavors of solar neutrinos [2] and measurement of \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 21 . The Double Chooz (DC) experiment detects another type of neutrino oscillation using reactor neutrinos at a \u223c 1 km baseline and is measuring a neutrino mixing parameter, \u03b8 13 . This article is to explain the Double Chooz experiment as a part of the special issue of the Nuclear Physics B, for celebrating the Nobel prize.

Therefore, the measurement of CP asymmetry in the lepton sector is particularly important now. \u03b4 CP in (6) was obtained assuming the standard three flavor oscillation scheme. However, the CP violation effect has to be measured model-independently, from the difference between an oscillation and its CP-inverted oscillation.

Daya Bay experiment published high precision \u03b8 13 result using near and far detectors, sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.096 \u00b1 0.017, in March 2012 [30] and the RENO experiment followed it showing sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.113 \u00b1 0.023 [31]. Since then, the accuracy of \u03b8 13 is being improved and its value is playing an important role in the neutrino oscillation studies. Fig. 1 shows an example of the strong synergy effect of the reactor and accelerator experiments. The overlap of the allowed regions indicates that the normal hierarchy and sin \u03b4 CP = \u22121 are slightly preferred. This kind of discussion could not be made if there were only one type of experiment. Using the measured \u03b8 13 , it has become possible to calculate the baseline dependence of the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance probability with the matter effect at the oscillation maximum (E/L = \u2206m 2 32 /2\u03c0) as shown in Fig. 2. The relation of T2K and NOvA results can be clearly comprehended from this figure. A similar calculation can be made for A CP as shown in Fig. 3. The data from long-baseline accelerator experiments with different baselines can be combined along a line to measure sin \u03b4 CP and the mass hierarchy at once.  Figure 2: Baseline dependence of the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance probability at the \u2206m 2 32oscillation maximum. The horizontal axis is the baseline and the vertical axis is the \u03bd e appearance probability. The four lines correspond to sin \u03b4 = \u00b11 and mass hierarchy cases. The thin error bars on the sin \u03b4 = \u22121 lines show uncertainty from the \u03b8 23 degeneracy. The data are 1\u03c3 range of T2K [33] and NOvA [34] results.

The central part (i) is the neutrino target which consists of a Gadolinium (Gd)-loaded liquid scintillator [36], with a 10 m 3 volume, contained in an acrylic vessel. The second liquid layer (ii) is Gd-free liquid scintillator nicknamed \u03b3-catcher, which detects \u03b3-rays escaping from the target region. The light output efficiency is tuned to be the same as the neutrino target in order to reconstruct the neutrino and Gd signal energy precisely. The volume is 23 m 3 and it is contained in the second acrylic vessel. The third liquid layer (iii) is a non scintillating oil called the buffer oil, which shields the background neutrons and \u03b3-rays from outside and PMT glass. The volume is 110 m 3 and it is contained in a stainless steel vessel. (iv) 390 10 inch low-background PMTs [37], which is mounted inside the stainless steel vessel, detect the scintillation lights from the neutrino target and the \u03b3-catcher. The set of the subdetectors: (i) to (iv) defines the Inner Detector (ID). The forth liquid layer (v) is another liquid scintillator, which actively vetoes the cosmic-ray background. Its volume is 90 m 3 and contained in a stainless steel vessel. This layer is named the Inner Veto (IV) and it is optically separated from the ID [38]. There are 15 cm thick demagnetized iron shields outside the tank. Finally the whole upper part of the detector is covered by a large-area plastic scintillator array (vi), called Outer muon Veto (OV), which vetoes the cosmic rays that do not hit the active detector region. The readout system [39] uses 500 MHz 8 bit flash ADC to keep wave forms for later detailed analyses.",

To predict the number of IBD events, all the simulation chain from the nuclear fission process in the reactor core, to the interaction in the liquids, until the event read out by the electronics is performed. At the reactor level, the MURE code, fed by the\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France S.A. (EdF) parameters, such as the thermal power, computes the fissile isotope composition and evolution through time [44]. The fission rates are then used together with the measured and calculated neutrino spectra [45] and IBD cross section to draw the neutrino energy. Then, both positron and neutron energy deposition, interaction process and light emission by the scintillator are simulated with a Geant4 based code with a custom neutron scattering model. A custom made package deals with the electronic pulse, which is the output signal from the PMTs, passing by the front-end electronics and recorded by the flash-ADC boards [35,37,39]. The final MC information has the same format as the data and all the reconstruction (pulse, vertex position, and energy) algorithms are applied in the same way to both sets. A high precision in this prediction is sought for since in the first phase of the experiment, only the far detector is used. Finally, to avoid uncounted factors on the reactor neutrino flux (such as model imprecision and/or short-ranged oscillations), DC uses the Bugey4 mean cross-section per fission measurement as an anchor point [46], where the difference of the reactor fuel compositions are taken into account.",

Its rate is easily estimated by the combination of the prompt and delayed single signal rates. Moreover, it can be precisely measured by an off-time method, where after the prompt event, an offset time window of one second is applied to search for the delayed candidate (adding more windows for this offset increases the statistics of the method).

The second achievement is the use of the IV, as explained above, to tag environmental high energy gammas (mainly from the 206 Thallium isotope) coming from the rocks that contaminates the prompt and delayed signals in case of n-H candidates.

Although similar results were reported by other experiments, this one from DC remains the only one published by the time of writing this paper 7 . DC uses another method of oscillation analysis, the so called Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM) fit [50]. A fit is performed comparing the predicted IBD rate with the measured one, at different reactor power regimes. It is comparable to a linear-fit, where the mixing angle is given by the slope angle and the total background rate by the intercept, i.e., where none IBD is expected. Therefore, this method is independent of spectral shape information but can still constrain the background rate in the fit. In addition, the RRM fit is robust against the spectrum distortion with a constraint from the Bugey4 measurement. The left plot of Fig. 9 shows this method used to fit both the n-Gd and n-H samples simultaneously, which gives sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.088 \u00b1 0.033.",

The shaded region represents the range of improvements expected by the reduction in the systematic uncertainties. While dominated by statistic uncertainty, the Double Chooz experiment will decrease considerably the systematic uncertainty in the Near+Far phase. In addition, DC is the best candidate to have the lowest reactor flux related uncertainty involved, given that the detectors are placed at nearly equal reactors iso-flux position [51].

In that workshop, the four layers detector concept was proposed by Double Chooz and KASKA groups and methodology of the high precision reactor \u03b8 13 experiment was mostly established.In March, 2004, at the midst of the Low Energy Neutrino Workshop in Niigata, the Double Chooz project was approved by the French funding agency. At that time there were six proposed projects world-wide, Double Chooz [19], Kr2Det[20] in Russia, KASKA [21] in Japan, Diablo Canyon [22] and Braidwood [23] in the U.S.A., Daya Bay [24] in China. Eventually, Daya Bay and newly proposed RENO [25] in Korea were funded also. By the year of 2006, Kr2Det, Braidwood",

It is a regular \u03c7 2 method where covariances matrices for the systematic shape uncertainties and pull terms for the known rates and variables. On the last n-Gd DC publication (Gd-III), this method resulted in sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.090 +0.032 \u22120.029 . Table 3 shows the normalization uncertainties for this measurement, and also for all the other data-set released so far by the DC collaboration. An interesting feature is illustrated on the left plot of Fig. 8, that shows the ratio between the best fit and the non-oscillated spectra. A \"bump\" is present on the 4 to 6 MeV and as the figure shows, this feature is also presented in the independent n-H sample. So far, there is no known background model that could accommodate this difference. Comparing data with the MC model of the energy response at this range, also using n-C captures and 12 B decay, did not show any energy reconstruction misbehaviour as well. However, as shown in the right plot of Fig. 8, a correlation between the excess and the reactor power was observed, giving an evidence that the current models of reactor neutrino flux might be insufficient. For the Gd analysis, such excess deviates from the prediction with a significance of 3\u03c3, and has a rate of 0.60 \u00b1 0.  Figure 10: Summary of the sin 2 2\u03b8 13 main measurements released by reactor and accelerator experiments since 2011.

The number of days represents the live-time of each data-release and when the detectors have different live-time in a same release, the biggest value was taken. The yellow band represents the result with lowest uncertainty delivered by DC so far, the Gd-III analysis. For each value, its arXiv number is given for quick reference.",
