            "text": "We report a new limit on a possible short range spin-dependent interaction from the precise measurement of the ratio of Larmor precession frequencies of stored ultracold neutrons and 199 Hg atoms confined in the same volume. The measurement was performed in a \u223c1 \u03bcT vertical magnetic holding field with the apparatus searching for a permanent electric dipole moment of the neutron at the Paul Scherrer Institute. A possible coupling between freely precessing polarized neutron spins and unpolarized nucleons of the wall material can be investigated by searching for a tiny change of the precession frequencies of neutron and mercury spins. Such a frequency change can be interpreted as a consequence of a short range spin-dependent interaction that could possibly be mediated by axions or axion-like particles. The interaction strength is proportional to the CP violating product of scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants g S g P . Our result confirms limits from complementary experiments with spin-polarized nuclei in a model-independent way. Limits from other neutron experiments are improved by up to two orders of magnitude in the interaction range of 10 \u22126 < \u03bb < 10 \u22124 m.",

The ratio R = f n f Hg (1) constitutes a sensitive tool for the control of systematic effects during the measurement of the nEDM. By correcting R properly for known differences of the Larmor precession of the two species neutrons and 199 Hg, respectively, the ratio of magnetic moments \u03b3 n /\u03b3 Hg can be extracted. A data set of R taken in 2012 was independently analysed in [1] and in [4], where we additionally examined its sensitivity to hypothetical short range spin-dependent interactions. Possible force mediators are axions, or axion-like particles and the interaction strength is proportional to the product of scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants g S g P . It has been proposed in [5,6] to use an nEDM apparatus for the investigation of such a force. A motivation to search for an interaction involving g S g P is given in Section 2. The influence of a short range spin-dependent interaction on the observable R is explained and derived in Section 3, where additionally some related details about the experiment are shown. Our result is compared to other current limits on the product g S g P in Section 4.",

An intrinsic feature of the Peccei-Quinn model is a fixed relation between mass and interaction strength of the axion. The originally assumed symmetry breaking scale (corresponding to the electroweak scale) was ruled out, leaving only higher energy scales possible. For the axion one thus expects a small mass and a feeble interaction with other particles. The possible mass of the axion is constrained by cosmology and astro-particle physics measurements to the so-called axion window [11].",

Therefore, we expect no shift in the Larmor frequency of the Hg atoms which sample the volume homogeneously. However, UCNs have such low energies that they are significantly affected by gravity and their density increases towards the bottom of the storage vessel. Thus, the vessel is inhomogeneously sampled and the effect of a pseudomagnetic field at the bottom of the chamber will not cancel out completely.

Experiments using free neutrons are depicted by solid lines. Experiments with precessing atoms, such as e.g. 3 He, 129 Xe, or 131 Xe, are depicted by dashed lines.

The big grey arrow indicates the main magnetic holding field B 0 . The blue shaded region is the inside of the chamber and indicates the inhomogeneous UCN density distribution. The red shapes depict Cs magnetometers[22] which are mounted above and below the storage chamber: four on top and seven at the bottom. These consist of a Cs-vapour filled glass bulb inside a shielded housing and serve to measure the vertical main magnetic field B 0 and also vertical magnetic field gradients G. The measures are the thickness d of the top and bottom plates of the vessel (coated with diamond-like carbon for improved UCN storage properties[18]), distance D between top and bottom Cs magnetometers, height H of the vessel, and radius C of the vessel. UCN are filled through a guide from below. The lateral wall of the vessel is a polystyrene ring with a deuterated coating for improved UCN storage properties[19]. The vacuum tank (VT) of the apparatus is enclosed by a four-layer magnetic shielding (MS) made from \u03bc-metal[20] and a surrounding field compensation (SFC) which actively stabilises the external magnetic field[21].
