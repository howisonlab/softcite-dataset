Cross sections are measured as functions of a variety of observables, including angular correlations and invariant masses of the objects in the final state, \u03b3 + jet + jet. Measurements are also performed in phase-space regions enriched in each of the two underlying physical mechanisms, namely direct and fragmentation processes. The measurements cover the range of photon (jet) transverse momenta from 150 GeV (100 GeV) to 2 TeV. The tree-level plus parton-shower predictions from Sherpa and Pythia as well as the next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from Sherpa are compared with the measurements. The next-to-leading-order QCD predictions describe the data adequately in shape and normalisation except for regions of phase space such as those with high values of the invariant mass or rapidity separation of the two jets, where the predictions overestimate the data.",

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

Measurements of the final state \u03b3 + jet + jet have the advantage that the second jet is explicitly identified and the interplay between the two underlying production mechanisms can be tested more directly than in the \u03b3 + jet final state. The two underlying production mechanisms exhibit distinct features in kinematic variables as well as in angular correlations or invariant masses of the objects in the final state. For example, the spectrum in E \u03b3 T (p jet T , m jet-jet ) is expected to be harder (softer) for direct processes than for fragmentation processes; as another example, angular correlations such as \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet are expected to be different for the two processes, with the two jets being closer to each other in direct processes than in fragmentation processes. These distinct features arise from the matrix elements of the two processes and the fraction of the centre-of-mass energy of the colliding partons carried away by the finalstate photon [16]. In order to enhance the sensitivity to the two underlying mechanisms, measurements are performed in two complementary regions of phase space, in addition to the inclusive phase space, by selecting those events in which E \u03b3 T is larger (smaller) than the leading (sub-leading) jet p T . 3 This separation allows a more in-depth study of the direct and fragmentation contributions since it is performed in terms of kinematic variables and, therefore, does not rely on distinguishing between direct and fragmentation processes using a MC generator. Furthermore, the photon is required to be isolated and the distance in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane between the photon and each of the jets is required to be larger than 0.8; the region of phase space in which a jet is close to the photon is removed to avoid a bias in the photon isolation energy as well as to suppress the dependence on the modelling of the fragmentation component in that region. The analysis is performed using 36.1 fb \u22121 of ATLAS data at \u221a s = 13 TeV taken during 2015 and 2016. The predictions of the tree-level plus parton shower models of Pythia [17] and Sherpa [18], as well as the next-to-leadingorder (NLO) QCD predictions from Sherpa [19][20][21][22][23], are compared with the measurements.",

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroidal magnets. The innerdetector system is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector is closest to the interaction region and provides four measurements per track; the innermost layer, known as the insertable B-layer [25,26], provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking performance. The pixel detector is followed by a silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four three-dimensional space-point measurements per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The calorimeter system covers the range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) EM calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters; for |\u03b7| < 2.5, the EM calorimeter is divided into three layers in depth. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid-angle coverage is completed out to |\u03b7| = 4.9 with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are optimised for EM and hadronic measurements, respectively. Events are initially selected using a first-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event-acceptance rate from the maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [27].",

Photon candidates are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter and classified [34] as unconverted photons (those candidates without a matching track or reconstructed conversion vertex in the inner detector) or converted photons (those candidates with a matching reconstructed conversion vertex or a matching track consistent with originating from a photon conversion). The photon identification is primarily based on shower shapes in the calorimeter [34]. The information from the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral shower shape in the second layer of the EM calorimeter are used in an initial selection. The final 'tight' selection comprises more stringent criteria for these variables as well as requirements on the shower shapes in the first layer of the EM calorimeter. Small differences are observed in the average values of the shower-shape variables between data and simulation and are corrected for in simulated events before applying the photon identification criteria. The photon identification efficiencies are measured to be above 90% (95%) for unconverted (converted) photon candidates with E \u03b3 T > 150 GeV. The measurement of the photon energy is based on the energy collected in calorimeter cells in an area of size \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.075 \u00d7 0.175 in the barrel and 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 in the endcaps. The photon energy calibration procedure is described in ref. [35]. The uncertainty in the photon energy scale at E \u03b3 T = 150 GeV is in the range 0.4%-3.1% (0.4%-2.8%) for unconverted (converted) candidates depending on |\u03b7 \u03b3 |, being largest in the region 1.81 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37.",

The four-momentum of jets is recalculated to point to the selected primary vertex of the event rather than the centre of the detector. The jet-area method is then used on a jet-by-jet basis [42] to subtract the contributions from the UE and pileup. Subsequently, a calibration of the jet energy and direction is applied that corrects the reconstructed jet four-momentum to the particle level. For this purpose, simulated events are employed and the same jet algorithm used on data is applied to the generated stable particles. Stable particles are defined as those with a decay length c\u03c4 > 10 mm. Muons, neutrinos and particles from pile-up interactions are excluded. The resulting jets are referred to as particle-level jets. Following the previous calibration, residual dependencies of the reconstructed jet energy on the longitudinal and transverse characteristics of the jet are observed. Corrections to reduce these dependencies are derived from simulated events, using global properties of the jet obtained from tracking information, calorimeter energy deposits and muon spectrometer information. These corrections are applied sequentially to the jet four-momentum while conserving the average jet response in the sample of dijet simulated events used to derive the corrections. These corrections improve the jet energy resolution and account for differences in energy response between quark-and gluon-initiated jets. Since the jet flavour composition of the final state \u03b3 + jet + jet is, in principle, different from that used for the calibration (dijet events), the corrections help to reduce the dependence on the jet flavour composition assumed. In addition, systematic uncertainties due to the jet flavour response and composition are considered. A final correction is applied to account for differences in the jet response between data and simulations. The final correction is derived in situ from a combination of dijet, \u03b3 + jet, Z + jet and multi-jet p T -balance methods. Dijet events are used to correct the average response for forward jets to that for well-measured central jets. The other three in situ calibrations correct for differences between the average responses for central jets and well-measured reference objects. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale at p jet T = 100 GeV varies in the range 1.5%-2% depending on the jet pseudorapidity.",

The bremsstrahlung component was modelled by final-state QED radiation arising from calculations of all 2 \u2192 2 QCD processes. The Sherpa samples were generated with LO matrix elements for photon-plus-jet final states with up to three additional partons (2 \u2192 n processes with n from 2 to 5); the matrix elements were merged with the Sherpa parton shower [49] using the ME+PS@LO prescription. The bremsstrahlung component is accounted for in Sherpa through the matrix elements of 2 \u2192 n processes with n \u2265 3. In the generation of the Sherpa samples, a requirement on the photon isolation at the matrix-element level was imposed using the criterion defined in ref. [50].

A requirement on the photon isolation at the matrix-element level is imposed using Frixione's criterion with R = 0.1, n = 2 and = 0.1; for the Sherpa NLO calculations the parameters are fixed to looser values than for the LO calculations to further minimise any possible bias from the application of the photon isolation requirement at particle level. The NNLO NNPDF3.0 PDFs [55] are used in conjunction with the corresponding Sherpa default tuning. Dynamic factorisation and renormalisation scales are adopted and set equal to E \u03b3 T , as well as a dynamical merging scale withQ cut = 20 GeV [56]. The strong coupling constant is set to \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.118. Fragmentation into hadrons and simulation of the UE are made using the same models as for the LO Sherpa samples of simulated events (see section 4.1).

The multi-jet background estimation relies on an in situ method based on signal-suppressed control regions. The method uses the same two-dimensional sideband technique as in previous analyses [7, 8, 37, 57-59] and it is described briefly in the following. The background subtraction procedure is performed bin by bin for each distribution. Two variables, the photon identification quality and E iso T , are used to define the control regions for the background estimation. The photon candidate is classified as 'isolated' if E iso T < E iso T,cut and as 'nonisolated' if E iso T,cut + 2 GeV < E iso T < 50 GeV. The non-isolated region is separated by 2 GeV from the isolated region to reduce the contamination from signal events. The upper bound in E iso T is applied to avoid highly non-isolated photons; in this way, the determination of the signal yield does not depend on the description by the MC generators of the distribution of E iso T for prompt photons with high values of E iso T . A photon candidate is classified as 'tight' if tight identification criteria are satisfied. It is classified as 'non-tight' if it fails at least one of four tight requirements on the shower-shape variables computed from the energy deposits in the first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, but satisfies the tight requirements listed below: the tight requirement on the total lateral shower width in the first layer, all the other tight identification criteria in other layers and the tight requirement on the leakage into the hadronic calorimeter [34].",

In this method, an unfolding matrix is constructed using the samples of simulated events. The unfolding matrix encapsulates the migrations across bin boundaries of the observable when switching between particle and reconstruction levels. The binning of the distributions is chosen according to the resolution in those variables and in some cases, such as at high E \u03b3 T or p jet T , larger bin sizes are used to reduce the statistical uncertainties in the data. There are observables that are filled once per event, such as E \u03b3 T , m jet-jet , \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet , |\u2206y jet-jet | and m \u03b3-jet-jet , and observables which are filled twice per event, such as p jet T , |y jet |, \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3-jet and |\u2206y \u03b3-jet |. The unfolding matrix is filled with those events that pass the selection requirements at both the reconstruction and particle levels. In addition, the reconstructed jet (photon) is required to be matched to a particle-level jet (photon) within \u2206R = 0.4 (0.2). Corrections are also applied to take into account the fractions of events for which there is no matching either at particle or reconstruction level; the fraction of unmatched particle-level (reconstruction-level) events is typically in the range 20%-40% (5%-25%). In the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties (see section 7.1), modifications of the unfolding matrix and of the corrections are applied simultaneously in a consistent way. Four iterations of the unfolding procedure are performed. The nominal cross sections are measured using the signal leakage fractions and unfolding matrices from LO Sherpa since these simulations describe the shape of the distributions of the signal yield better than those of Pythia. The results obtained by unfolding the data with Pythia are used to estimate the model dependence and their deviations from the nominal results are taken as systematic uncertainties, as explained in section 7.1.5. The results of the Bayesian unfolding procedure are checked with a bin-by-bin method based on LO Sherpa simulations, giving consistent results; the systematic uncertainty due to the unfolding procedure is negligible.",

Figures 2 and 3 show the total systematic uncertainty, excluding the uncertainty of the luminosity determination, for each measured cross section for the total phase space. The dominant components, namely the jet energy scale, the photon energy scale and the photon identification, are shown separately in these figures. There are variables such as \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet for which the systematic uncertainties due to the jet and photon energy scales depend on the variable itself. These dependencies arise from the event topology: at low \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet the two jets are close together and recoil against the photon whereas at high \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet the two jets recoil against each other and the photon has lower p T . Thus, the populations in jet and photon p T vary with \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet . In the total phase space, the systematic uncertainty dominates the total experimental uncertainty for E \u03b3 T 1 TeV, p jet T 1.5 TeV and m \u03b3-jet-jet 4 TeV. For higher E \u03b3 T , p jet T and m \u03b3-jet-jet values, the statistical uncertainty of the data limits the precision of the measurements. For other observables, the systematic uncertainty dominates in the whole measured range. In particular, in the tails of the distributions of p jet T , |\u2206y \u03b3-jet | and m \u03b3-jet-jet the contributions from the statistical uncertainties of the MC samples and the systematic uncertainty in the unfolding correction due to the parton-shower and hadronisation model dependence can be as large as the systematic uncertainty due to the jet energy scale.",

The uncertainty in the NLO pQCD predictions from Sherpa due to terms beyond NLO is estimated by repeating the calculations using values of the renormalisation (\u00b5 R ) and factorisation (\u00b5 F ) scales multiplied by the factors 0.5 or 2. The two scales are varied either simultaneously or individually. In all cases, the condition 0.5 \u2264 \u00b5 R /\u00b5 F \u2264 2 is imposed. The largest deviation from each nominal prediction among the six possible variations is taken as the uncertainty. The uncertainty in the predictions due to the proton PDFs is estimated by using 100 replicas from the NNPDF3.0 analysis [55]. The uncertainty in the predictions due to the uncertainty in \u03b1 s is estimated by repeating the calculations using two additional sets of proton PDFs from the NNPDF3.0 analysis, for which different values of \u03b1 s (m Z ) were assumed in the fits, namely 0.117 and 0.119; in this way, the correlation between \u03b1 s and the PDFs is preserved.",

First, since Pythia uses 2 \u2192 2 matrix elements, the second jet necessarily originates from the parton shower; Sherpa incorporates matrix elements for the processes 2 \u2192 n with n = 2 to 5 and thus the second jet is better simulated. Second, the fragmentation component in Pythia is overestimated for the parameter settings used here. This is particularly visible in the cross section for the total phase space as a function of p jet T in the region p jet T > 300 GeV, where the prediction overestimates the data by 50% or more. It is also visible in the cross section for the total phase space as a function of m jet-jet and m \u03b3-jet-jet , where the predictions of Pythia overestimate the data by up to an order of magnitude. The overestimation of the fragmentation component is also supported by the fact that the normalisation factor for the predictions from Pythia is 1.2 (0.7) for the total (fragmentation-enriched) phase space. The inclusion of higher-order tree-level matrix elements for the processes 2 \u2192 n with n = 3 to 5 in Sherpa significantly improves the description of the data for all observables and phase-space regions.",

The NLO Sherpa predictions describe the data adequately in shape and normalisation within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties except for ranges at high values of |\u2206y \u03b3-jet |, |\u2206y jet-jet |, m jet-jet and m \u03b3-jet-jet , where the predictions overestimate the data in the total and fragmentation-enriched phase-space regions. In those ranges, the overestimation of the predictions relative to the data is larger in the fragmentation-enriched phase space than when considering the total phase space. These discrepancies might be attributable to unaccounted higher-order corrections given the fact that the variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales leads to relatively large uncertainties in the predictions. In particular, the use of E \u03b3 T as the scale might not be optimal in the ranges where p jet T is much larger than E \u03b3 T . A mismodelling of the high tail in m jet-jet is also observed for the measurements of the final state V + jet + jet with V = W \u00b1 or Z boson [64][65][66]. In addition, decorrelation effects from multiple parton emission might be present at large values of |\u2206y \u03b3-jet | and |\u2206y jet-jet |. The comparison of the predictions based on different parameterisations of the proton PDFs shows that the description of the data does not depend significantly on the specific PDF used. The theoretical uncertainties are much larger than the experimental ones and, therefore, more precise calculations are needed, either in the form of resummed calculations or through the inclusion of higherorder terms. Once the size of the uncertainties of the predictions is reduced significantly, a meaningful comparison with predictions including electroweak effects will be possible.",

These measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 of ATLAS data recorded at the LHC. The photon is required to have E \u03b3 T > 150 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, excluding the region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.56. The jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4. The cross sections are measured as functions of E \u03b3 T , p jet T , |y jet |, \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3-jet , |\u2206y \u03b3-jet |, m jet-jet , \u2206\u03c6 jet-jet , |\u2206y jet-jet | and m \u03b3-jet-jet in three different regions of phase space, namely the total phase space, the fragmentation-photon enriched phase space where E \u03b3 T < p jet2 T and the direct-photon enriched phase space where E \u03b3 T > p jet1 T . The measurements extend up to values of 2 TeV in E \u03b3 T and p jet T . The dependence of the cross sections on m jet-jet and m \u03b3-jet-jet is measured up to values of 4 TeV and 5.5 TeV, respectively. The measured cross sections in the fragmentation-photon and direct-photon enriched phase-space regions exhibit the features expected from the two underlying production mechanisms, each of which dominates in one of the two regions, and for some observables, from the effects of the kinematical constraints that define the two phase-space regions.",
