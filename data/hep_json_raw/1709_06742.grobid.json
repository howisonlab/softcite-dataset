The ratio of the two-photon widths between helicity-zero and helicity-two components in the decay \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is also measured to be f 0/2 = \u0393 \u03bb=0 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7c2)/\u0393 \u03bb=2 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7c2) = (0.0 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.

            "text": "Any discrepancy from this lowest order prediction can arise due to QCD radiative corrections or relativistic corrections. The measurement of R provides useful information on these effects. Theoretical predictions on the decay rates are obtained using a non-relativistic approximation [4,5], potential model [6], relativistic quark model [7,8], non-relativistic QCD factorization framework [9,10], effective Lagrangian [11], as well as lattice calculations [12]. The predictions for the ratio R \u2261 \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7 c2 )/\u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7 c0 ) cover a wide range of values between 0.09 and 0.36. The decay \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is forbidden by the Landau-Yang theorem [13]. Precise measurements of these quantities will guide the development of theory. The two-photon decay widths of \u03c7 c0,2 have been measured by many experiments [14]. Using the decay of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,2 , \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, both CLEO-c and BESIII experiments reported results of the two-photon decay widths \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7 c0,2 ) [15,16]. BESIII has now collected the largest \u03c8(3686) data sample in e + e \u2212 collisions, which provides a good opportunity to update and improve these measurements.",

The GEANT4based [22] simulation software BOOST [23] includes the geometric and material description of the BESIII detectors, the detector response and digitization models, as well as the tracking of the detector running conditions and performance. The production of the \u03c8(3686) resonance is simulated by the MC event generator KKMC [24], while its decays are generated by EVTGEN [25] for known decay modes with branching ratios being set to the world average values in Particle Data Group (PDG) [14], and by LUNDCHARM [26] for the remaining unknown decays. For the simulation of the continuum process, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3), the Babayaga [27] QED event generator is used.",

This requirement is used to suppress continuum background, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3), where the two energetic photons have high probability of distributing in the forward and backward regions. The average interaction point of each run is assumed as the origin for the selected candidates. A four-constraint (4C) kinematic fit is performed by constraining the total four momentum to that of the initial e + e \u2212 system, and events with \u03c7 2 4C \u2264 80 are retained. The energy spectrum of the radiative photon, E(\u03b3 1 ), which has the smallest energy among the three photon candidates, is shown in Fig. 1, where structures associated with the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 are clearly observed over substantial backgrounds.",

[33]. On average, the efficiency difference between data and MC simulation is less than 1%. The average momenta of the two high-energy photons are about 1.7 GeV/c. The corresponding systematic uncertainty on its reconstruction is determined to be 0.25% per photon as described in Ref. [34], which is estimated based on a control sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 . The total uncertainty associated with the reconstruction of the three photons is 1.5%. To suppress the background, the number of selected photon candidates is required to be exactly three. An alternative analysis is performed by requiring at least three photons. Looping over all the three photon combinations in the 4C kinematic fit, we take the combination with the minimum \u03c7 2 for this fit as the final photon candidates. We then perform the same procedure to extract the final results, and the resultant changes with respect to the nominal values are less than 0.1%. Thus the uncertainty associated with the requirement of exactly three photons is negligible.",

The shape of the \u03c7 c1 signal is parameterized using a smoothed MC histogram convolved with a Gaussian function, G(0, \u03c3), where \u03c3 is fixed to the resolution difference between data and MC simulation of the \u03c7 c0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 process.

The inconsistency consists of the discrepancy associated with the energy resolution and detection efficiency for photon, the kinematic fit, the trigger efficiency, selection efficiency, and the method to subtract the background. The reliability of this method has been validated by many analyses [16,36,37]. Since the \u03c7 c0 is pure helicity-zero, the x and y parameters in Eq. 4are expected to be zero. For the \u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay, the helicity value difference between the two photons is also expected to be zero, which means only the \u03bb = 0 term in Eq. (4) remains.

This is larger than the theoretical calculation taking into consideration the first order radiative correction [38], which obtains a reduction from the nominal 4/15 = 0.267 by a multiplicative factor of (1 \u2212 5.51\u03b1 s /\u03c0). This may indicate an inadequacy of the calculation; higher-order radiative correction calculations are desirable. Alternatively, as noted by Buchm\u00fcller [39], a different scheme or scale of the the renormalization is necessary to obtain better convergence for the radiative corrections. Moreover, the precise R values obtained can help to calibrate the different theoretical potential models [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12].",
