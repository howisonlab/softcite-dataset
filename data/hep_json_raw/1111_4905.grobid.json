            "text": "Exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons takes place through a virtual photon \u03b3 * by means of the process \u03b3 * p \u2192 Vp. At large values of the centre-of-mass energy, W , this is usually viewed as a three-step process; the virtual photon \u03b3 * fluctuates into a qq pair which interacts with the proton through a two-gluon ladder and hadronizes into a vector meson, V . The production of ground-state vector mesons, V = \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J /\u03c8, \u03a5 , which are 1S triplet qq states, has been extensively studied at HERA, particularly in several recent publications [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. As the virtuality, Q 2 , of the photon increases, the process becomes hard and can be calculated in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). Furthermore, by varying Q 2 , and thus the size of the qq pair, sensitivity to the vector-meson wavefunction can be obtained by scanning it at different qq distance scales. Expectations in the QCD framework vary from calculations based only on the mass properties and typical size of the qq inside the vector-meson [11,12], to those based on the details of the vector meson wave-function dependence on the size of the qq pair [13][14][15][16][17]. The approaches differ in their predictions for the Q 2 dependence of the cross sections for excited vector-meson states and their ratio to their ground state.",

The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution shows a complex structure in the mass range 1-2 GeV. Evidence for two excited vector-meson states has been established [21,22]; the \u03c1 (1450) is assumed to be predominantly a radially excited 2S state and the \u03c1 (1700) is an orbitally excited 2D state, with some mixture of the S and D waves [23]. In addition there is also the \u03c1 3 (1690) spin-3 meson [24] which has a \u03c0\u03c0 decay mode. The two-pion decay mode of these resonances is related [25,26] to the pion electromagnetic form factor, F \u03c0 (M \u03c0\u03c0 ).",

The masses and widths of the three resonances were fixed to the values found in the overall fit and listed in Table 1. The results are shown in Fig. 8. A reasonable description of the data is achieved in all three Q 2 regions. The corresponding values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 are given in Table 2. The absolute value of \u03b2 increases with Q 2 while the value of \u03b3 is consistent with no Q 2 dependence, within large uncertainties.  Table 2 The Q 2 dependence of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 parameters. Masses and widths are fixed to the values given in Table 1.

Also shown are results obtained in the time-like regime from the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In general, the features of the |F \u03c0 (M \u03c0\u03c0 )| 2 distribution observed here are also observed in e + e \u2212 , i.e., the prominent \u03c1 peak, a shoulder around the \u03c1 and a dip followed by an enhancement in the \u03c1 region. Above the \u03c1 region, where the interference between the \u03c1 and the \u03c1 starts to dominate, there is a dependence of |F \u03c0 (M \u03c0\u03c0 )| 2 on Q 2 , with the results from the lowest Q 2 range closest to those from e + e \u2212 . However, in the region of the \u03c1 peak, shown in Fig. 10, the pion form-factor |F \u03c0 (M \u03c0\u03c0 )| 2 is highest at the highest Q 2 , as in the \u03c1 -\u03c1 interference region, while the e + e \u2212 data are higher than those in the highest Q 2 range.
