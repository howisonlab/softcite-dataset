Conventional approaches select B meson decay products that are significantly displaced from the B meson production vertex. As a consequence, B mesons with low decay times are suppressed, introducing a bias to the decay time spectrum which must be corrected. This analysis uses a technique that explicitly avoids a lifetime bias by using a neural network based trigger and event selection. Using 1.0 fb \u22121 of data recorded by the LHCb experiment, the effective B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 lifetime is measured as 1.455 \u00b1 0.046 (stat.) \u00b1 0.006 (syst.",

Adopting the approach of Ref. [3] and using the world averages of \u0393 s and \u0393 s [10] and the SM prediction of A \u0393 s , the effective lifetime is predicted to be \u03c4 KK = 1.40 \u00b1 0.02 ps. However, the B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay is dominated by penguin diagrams and so is sensitive to physics beyond the SM entering at loop level, which may affect A \u0393 s . The measurement is also sensitive to new physics contributions to the B 0 s mixing phase which in turn affects \u0393 s [11]. Deviations from this prediction will therefore provide evidence of new physics. Conventional selections exploit the long lifetimes of b-hadrons by requiring that their decay products are significantly displaced from the primary interaction point. However, this introduces a time-dependent acceptance of the selected b-hadron candidates which needs to be taken into account in the analysis. This Letter describes a technique based on neural networks which avoids such acceptance effects. Only properties independent of the decay time are used to discriminate between signal and background.

The LHCb detector [12] is a single arm spectrometer with a pseudorapidity acceptance of 2 < \u03b7 < 5 for charged particles. The detector includes a high precision tracking system, which consists of a silicon vertex detector and dedicated tracking planes. The tracking planes consist of silicon microstrip detectors in the region with high charged-particle flux close to the beam pipe and straw tube detectors which provide coverage up to the edge of the LHCb geometrical acceptance. The tracking planes are located either side of the dipole magnet to allow the measurement of the momenta of charged particles as they traverse the detector. Excellent particle identification capabilities are provided by two ring imaging Cherenkov detectors which allow charged pions, kaons and protons to be distinguished from each other in the momentum range 2-100 GeV/c. The energy of particles traversing the detector is measured using a calorimeter system which is sensitive to photons and electrons, as well as hadrons. Muons are identified using a dedicated detector system.

Combinatorial background candidates, produced by the random combination of tracks, tend to have low momentum and originate from a primary pp collision vertex. These features are typically exploited to select b-hadrons and reject background. The distance of closest approach (impact parameter) of b-hadron decay products to any primary vertex is a particularly important discriminant in the trigger because it is an order of magnitude faster to compute than the momenta of the same decay products. For this reason, the majority of triggers for hadronic b-hadron decays begin by selecting tracks with a significant displacement from any primary vertex. However, such requirements introduce a time-dependent acceptance which biases the decay time distribution of the selected b-hadron candidates and a significant investment of effort is often required to correct for this bias.",
