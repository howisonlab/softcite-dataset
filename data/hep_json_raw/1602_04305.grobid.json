Events consistent with the topology of associated VH production, where the Higgs boson decays to a pair of bottom quarks and the vector boson decays leptonically, are analyzed. The consistency of data with a potential pseudoscalar contribution to the HVV interaction, expressed by the effective pseudoscalar cross section fractions f a 3 , is assessed by means of profile likelihood scans. Results are given for the VH channels alone and for a combined analysis of the VH and previously published H \u2192 VV channels. Under certain assumptions, f ZZ a 3 > 0.0034 is excluded at 95% confidence level in the combination. Scenarios in which these assumptions are relaxed are also considered.",

The ultimate LHC sensitivity to a potential pseudoscalar interaction in these channels is expected to greatly exceed that of H \u2192 VV [19]. Due to the highly off-shell nature of the propagator in VH production, small anomalous couplings can lead to significant modifications of cross sections and kinematic features. In particular, the propagator mass, measured by the VH invariant mass, m (VH), is highly sensitive to anomalous HVV couplings [20].",

The qq \u2192 VH \u2192 Vbb and gg \u2192 H \u2192 VV processes involve the Yukawa fermion coupling Hff and the same HVV coupling, assuming gluon fusion production is dominated by the top-quark loop. The dominance of the gluon fusion production mechanism of the Higgs boson at the LHC is supported by experimental measurements [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. It is interesting to consider models where the ratio of the Hbb and Htt coupling strengths in the VH and H \u2192 VV processes is not affected by the presence of anomalous contributions [21]. In such a case, it is possible to relate the cross sections of the two processes for arbitrary anomalous HVV couplings and perform a combined analysis of the VH and H \u2192 VV processes, exploiting both kinematics and the relative signal strengths of the two processes. The H \u2192 VV signal strength is relatively well measured and can provide a strong constraint on the VH signal strength. For modest values of f ZZ a 3 , the VH signal strength is constrained to large values. The added constraint http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.004 0370-2693/\u00a9 2016 The Author.

The triangle diagram mediated by a CP-odd HVV interaction is completely anti-symmetric under the reversal of the direction of loop momentum flow; the diagrams with opposite loop momentum flow therefore perfectly cancel one another. As the a HZZ 1 coupling varies within a profile likelihood scan, the box contribution remains fixed while the triangle contribution and the interference must be varied accordingly. This is accomplished by reweighting the simulated gg \u2192 ZH event sample to have the correct m (VH) distribution at the generator level, including interference effects.

In the W \u2192 \u03bd (Z \u2192 ) channels, Higgs boson candidates are constructed from the pair of jets (referred to as j 1 and j 2 ) with the largest vector p T sum among jets with p T > 30 (20) GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The Z boson candidates are constructed from lepton pairs whose invariant mass is consistent with the Z boson mass. The W boson candidates are constructed by combining the momentum of the identified lepton with the event E miss T , and calculating the neutrino momentum along the beam axis based on a W boson mass constraint. To suppress contributions from QCD multijet events, in the W \u2192 \u03bd channels the magnitude of the E miss T vector must exceed 45 GeV and it must be separated in direction from the charged lepton by less than \u03c0/2 radians in azimuth. In addition, the Higgs boson candidate p T must exceed 100 GeV.The analysis sensitivity is increased further by categorizing events into medium-and high-boost regions based on the p T of the vector boson candidate. The bulk of the sensitivity comes from the high-boost region. These regions are later combined statistically. In the W \u2192 \u03bd channels, the medium-and high-boost regions are defined by 130 < p T (W) < 180 GeV and p T (W) > 180 GeV, respectively. In the Z \u2192 channels, the regions are instead defined by 50 < p T (Z) < 100 GeV and p T (Z) > 100 GeV. The low-boost region described in Ref.[23]  is not included because of its negligible sensitivity to anomalous couplings.
