            "text": "where \u2113 \u2212 is an electron or a muon, to be in excess of standard model (SM) predictions [1]. The use of charge conjugate reactions is implied throughout this article. After combining the results for R and R * , the excess is inconsistent with lepton universality at the 3.4\u03c3 level. The Belle Collaboration [2] and the LHCb Collaboration [3] conducted similar measurements with comparable results. A measurement of B(B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 ) using \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bd \u03c4 decays, normalized to B(B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ), may yield the observation of a further deviation from the SM. Such a measurement has not been done before and may make use of a clean kinematic signature. This possibility relies in part on a measurement of B(B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ), for which the current world average value is (7.0 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [4]. The LHCb Collaboration measured this value to be (7.27 \u00b1 0.11(stat.) \u00b1 0.36(syst.) \u00b1 0.34(norm.))\u00d710 \u22123 [5], where the final uncertainty is due to using B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + decays for normalization purposes. This measurement has not been included in the world average value as yet. In this article, we report on a measurement of B(B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ). We use data recorded with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider at SLAC. The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [6,7]. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 424.2 \u00b1 1.8 fb \u22121 collected at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance [8], which corresponds to the production of (470.9\u00b12.8)\u00d710 6 BB pairs. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to understand background processes and signal reconstruction efficiencies. The EvtGen event generator [9] is used to simulate particle decays. This includes a sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq(\u03b3) events, where q is a u, d, s, or c quark, with an equivalent luminosity of 2,589 fb \u22121 and a sample of 1, 427 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs. The detector response is simulated with the Geant4 [10] suite of programs.",

We require D 0 candidates to have an invariant-mass value within \u00b120 MeV/c 2 of the nominal D 0 mass [4], which corresponds to 3 standard deviations in its mass resolution. Each D 0 candidate is combined with a charged-particle track with momentum less than 0.45 GeV/c in the e + e \u2212 center-of-mass (CM) frame to form a D * \u2212 candidate. We require the difference between the reconstructed mass of the D * \u2212 candidate and the reconstructed mass of the D 0 candidate to lie between 0.1435 and 0.1475 GeV/c 2 . The D * \u2212 candidate is combined with three other chargedparticle tracks to form a B 0 candidate. We do not explicitly apply particle identification to select charged pions, but assign the pion mass hypothesis to all tracks other than the K + daughter of the D 0 . All other reconstructed tracks and neutral clusters in the event are collectively referred to as the rest of the event (ROE). We use a neural network classifier [11] to suppress non-BB backgrounds.",

Each of the peaking backgrounds from B + B \u2212 and B 0 B 0 is modeled by a Gaussian distribution for which the normalization, mean, and width, are determined by a fit to the corresponding simulated event sample.

The cutoff parameter for the ARGUS function is fixed to \u221a s/2, and the peaking background PDF shapes and normalizations are fixed to their MC-estimated values. The peaking background contributions are estimated to be 590 \u00b1 120 and 1450 \u00b1 130 candidates from B + B \u2212 and B 0 B 0 decays, respectively; some originate from signal decays where one or more pion is misreconstructed even when there is a correctly reconstructed B 0 candidate.

The values we used are shown in Table II. These values are obtained entirely from studies of MC-simulated background samples. Therefore, we consider varying the mean and width of the m ES distributions for the peaking B + B \u2212 and B 0 B 0 backgrounds, the number of B 0 B 0 and B + B \u2212 peaking background events, and the Crystal Ball PDF cutoff and power-law parameter values for the signal. These values are sampled from an eight-dimensional Gaussian function with means, widths, and correlations that correspond to the fit results for the PDF's for signal and peaking backgrounds from simulated events. The systematic uncertainty is taken as the standard deviation of the distribution of the number of signal events from an ensemble of fits, and is found to be 2.4%. The systematic uncertainty due to track-finding consists of two components: 1.54% for laboratory momenta less than 0.18 GeV/c, a region dominated by tracks from the decay D * \u2212 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , and 0.26% for greater than this value [17]. The two components are added in quadrature. The pion from the D * \u2212 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 decay has momentum less than 0.180 GeV/c 62% of the time. The corresponding fraction for other pions in the signal B 0 decay is 5%. The 3\u03c0 invariant-mass of the D + s contamination has the same mass location and width in the data and MC-simulated events. However, there are differences between the full reconstructed 3\u03c0 invariant-mass spectrum for the data and that obtained from MC-simulated events. We studied the signal yield before and after reweighting the 3\u03c0 invariantmass spectrum in the MC-simulated events to match the data. The observed change due to the reweighting of the 3\u03c0 mass distribution is 1.7%, which we assign as the associated systematic uncertainty. This also accounts for uncertainties in the relative contributions of the different decay modes and the mass and width of the a + 1 reso- nance. We use the D * \u2212 and D 0 decay branching fraction uncertainties from Ref. [4]. We use the value of B(\u03a5 (4S) \u2192 B 0 B 0 ) = 0.486 \u00b1 0.006 from Ref. [4] for the branching fraction of the decay \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 B 0 B 0 , which has a relative uncertainty of 1.2%. The kaon identification uncertainty is estimated by comparing the number of D * \u2212 events in data and MC simulations with and without implementing identification requirements. According to dedicated studies using BABAR data control samples, we correct for kaon-identification efficiency differences between data and MC simulation by a factor of 0.978 \u00b1 0.011, where the uncertainty is chosen to be half the difference from unity. The signal efficiency MC statistical uncertainty is 0.9%. Nominally, we subtract the 3\u03c0 mass distribution in the sideband from that of the signal region. However, the 3\u03c0 mass distribution of both peaking and non-peaking backgrounds in the signal region may not necessarily be the same as that in the sideband. To estimate the associated systematic uncertainty, we test the sideband subtraction procedure using only MC-simulated background events. After applying efficiency corrections to the resulting distribution, we obtain an integral of 571. Dividing this by the number of efficiency-corrected signal in the data, this translates to a 0.7% difference, which we assign as the associated systematic uncertainty. The number of B mesons produced is uncertain to 0.6% [8]. We studied the MC modeling of decay angle correlations, and found the associated systematic uncertainty to be negligible. As described earlier in the text, there is a peaking background contribution in the m ES distribution due to signal events that are misreconstructed. The rate of this background depends on the branching fraction of signal events. Using our measured branching fraction value, we apply corrections to the expected number of B 0 B 0 peaking background and repeat the signal extraction procedure on the data. There is a small bias on the branching fraction value but it is negligible compared to the systematic uncertainty due to the other peaking backgrounds. From the number of fitted signal events, corrected for efficiency and normalized to the total number of produced B 0 mesons in the data sample, and taking into account the D * \u2212 and D 0 branching fractions we derive B(B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (7.26 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The result is consistent with the current world average and is 2.4 times more precise. This result can be used as input for measurements of R ( * ) using hadronic \u03c4 decays in the search for deviations from the SM. The inclusive branching fraction value without removing the D + s contamination is (7.37 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",
