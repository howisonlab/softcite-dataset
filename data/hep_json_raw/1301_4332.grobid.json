In this work, the Toy Monte Carlo, based on an extended unbinned likelihood ratio test statistic, was used. The effect of each model and detector parameter, as well as the required detector exposure, was then studied. While uncertainties on the Earth density and atmospheric neutrino flux profiles were found to have a minor impact on the mass hierarchy discrimination, the flux normalization, as well as some of the oscillation parameter (\u2206m 2 31 , \u03b8 13 , \u03b8 23 , and \u03b4 CP ) uncertainties and correlations resulted critical. Finally, the minimum required detector exposure, the optimization of the low energy threshold, and the detector resolutions were also investigated.",

Last but not least, the recent observation of \u03bd e disappearance in several short-baseline reactor experiments [5][6][7] has provided the first high significance measurement of the mixing angle \u03b8 13 which drives the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd e transition amplitude. The relatively large value of this parameter, JHEP04(2013)008 sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) \u2243 0.1, is an asset for the subsequent searches for the remaining major unknowns of the model, in particular the possible presence of a CP-violating phase in the neutrino sector, and the neutrino mass hierarchy (NMH). The ordering of neutrino mass eigenstates is indeed not univocally determined so far; two solutions remain possible, usually dubbed as normal hierarchy (NH: m 1 < m 2 < m 3 , with \u2206m 2 21 \u2261 \u03b4m 2 and \u2206m 2 32 \u2243 \u2206m 2 31 \u2261 \u2206m 2 ) and inverted hierarchy (IH: m 3 < m 1 < m 2 , with \u2206m 2 21 \u2261 \u03b4m 2 and \u2206m 2 23 \u2243 \u2206m 2 13 \u2261 \u2206m 2 ). The question of NMH discrimination is on the agenda of most current and nextgeneration neutrino experiments in the GeV energy domain. 1 Its determination at high confidence level (5 \u03c3 or more), however, remains challenging and could take as long as 15 to 20 years even within optimistic estimates [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. The reach of accelerator experiments is indeed strongly dependent on the still unknown value of \u03b4 CP [21], while atmospheric neutrino experiments suffer from the large uncertainties in the fluxes and from the relatively low statistics. The latter experiments have nonetheless the advantage of probing \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd e oscillations over a wide range of propagation distances (or baselines) and neutrino energies, accessing thereby the richness of matter effects that arise in the propagation of neutrinos through the Earth [22] (see also collective references in ref. [17] for example).",

These instruments were primarily designed for the detection of extra-terrestrial neutrinos in the TeV to PeV energy range, but they also measure atmospheric neutrinos. They consist in 3-dimensional arrays of photomultipliers (PMTs) that detect the Cherenkov light originating from the products of the neutrino interaction in and around the instrumented volume. The arrival direction of the parent neutrino and its energy can be inferred from the timing, position and amplitude of the hits recorded by the PMTs. The directional accuracy is best for \u03bd \u00b5 -induced muon tracks, which can be reconstructed even if they are not fully contained inside the detector volume. The detection of contained showers is also possible, with a relatively accurate estimation of the neutrino energy based on the measurement of the total amount of light deposited in the detector. The optimization of such instruments for a given neutrino energy range is therefore a trade-off between the total target volume and the density of photosensors. Although they do not have charge identification capabilities, these detectors could observe the imprint of the NMH in the pattern of events of a given flavor detected at different energies and baselines, provided their angular and energy accuracies are sufficient.",

Muons with energies of a few GeV indeed travel distances of the order of ten meters. For this reason the distance between the optical modules has to be of the order of a few meters, much less than in currently operating detectors. A denser array provides better energy and angular resolution; however, for the same total number of PMTs, the fiducial volume gets reduced. Therefore a compromise for an optimal spacing of the optical modules has to be found. Such optimization studies are underway for both detector sites.",

Throughout this paper, the effective mass normalization has been anchored at 40 GeV, meaning that all results will be presented in terms of effective exposure defined in units of megaton year (Mt \u00d7 year) at 40 GeV. With this convention, the effective volume quoted for PINGU in ref. [24] corresponds to 34.1 Mt. The intrinsic detector capabilities are not the only factor that could spoil the measurement of NMH. Uncertainties in the incident atmospheric neutrino flux will affect the initial \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd e ratio, while those related to the neutrino oscillation parameters and the Earth density profile can further modify the flavor content of oscillated neutrinos that are observed at the detector level. Last but not least, at such low energies the kinematics of neutrino interaction also induces an intrinsic uncertainty on the incident neutrino direction, even for \u00b5-like events. All these effects have to be carefully studied in order to evaluate their potential impact on the NMH measurement. In addition, an appropriate statistical method has to be used to properly estimate the confidence level with which one can hope to discriminate between NH and IH.",

For this ideal case, perfect energy and angle resolutions, the reference conditions, mentioned in the previous JHEP04(2013)008 As already mentioned, there is no currently available detailed studies on ORCA/PINGU mass profiles. Other references, e.g. [33], quote different profiles with respect to eq. (1.1) [24]. To understand the impact of the mass profile, the optimal case with neutrino detection efficiency equal to 1, independently on the energy, was tested. The corresponding effective exposure profile and p-value are shown in figure 6 and 7, respectively. In this case, the required effective exposure, for a p-value equal to 0.5 at 5 \u03c3 C.L., is reduced by a factor \u223c3.  This result demonstrates the significant impact of the detection efficiency in the lower energy region, namely at 5-10 GeV, where the NMH asymmetry is large, as shown in figure 4, and the expected flux is high. Future Monte Carlo studies should focus on identifying the detector configuration able to optimize the efficiency at lower energies. In order to better appreciate the impact of the model uncertainties and of the detector resolutions, discussed in the next sections, an effective exposure of 170 Mt \u00d7 year, corresponding to a p-value \u223c1 at 5 \u03c3 C.L. is hereafter assumed.",

To study their effects, both the true and the model hypotheses were modified the same way, according to the angular and energy resolutions. A smearing was introduced on the energy and the zenith angle for each generated event in the Monte Carlo simulations, using Gaussian distributions. Events falling outside the analysis range, with cos \u03b8 > 0 or muon energy < 5 or > 40 GeV, were discarded. Since no Monte Carlo based prediction has been published so far with dedicated simulations on ORCA or PINGU detectors in the 5 to 40 GeV energy range, the following resolutions were arbitrarily tested: \u03c3 \u03b8 = 5, 10 and 15 degrees, and \u03c3 E /E = 15%, 30% and [deg] In figure 16 the NH-IH asymmetry is shown for \u03c3 \u03b8 = 10 degrees and \u03c3 E /E = 30%. Even if the asymmetry has a pattern similar to the ideal case (see figure 4), the p-value JHEP04(2013)008  Another way to increase the p-value, when reduced by detector resolutions, would be the reconstruction of low energy muons below the 5 GeV threshold. The p-values obtained when the analysis range is 1 to 40 GeV are shown in figure 15. A maximum increase of \u223c28% and \u223c34% on the p-value can be reached at 3 and 5 \u03c3 C.L. respectively. Nonetheless, in the low energy region between 1 and 5 GeV, degradations of the resolution are expected. In addition, as mentioned in section 3, systematics coming from the cross sections uncertainty should be considered below 5 GeV.",

In this work, a Toy Monte Carlo, based on an unbinned likelihood ratio test statistic, was developed to quantitatively investigate their discrimination potential. This approach allows to compute the probability of NMH discrimination, at a given C.L., while keeping track of possible misidentifications between hierarchies. For this purpose, a complete simulation chain, from neutrino generation to propagation and interaction, was implemented based on GLoBES and GENIE software tools.",

Assuming the same energy dependence of the detector effective mass as in ref.

This number JHEP04(2013)008 can be significantly reduced by improving the detection efficiency in the 5-10 GeV muon energy region. Another way to increase the discrimination power, although with a weaker impact, relies on the lowering of the detection energy threshold down to 1 GeV. However, achieving the needed resolutions might be challenging below 5 GeV. A critical improvement could come from the reconstruction of the associated hadronic shower, not considered in this work.",

The effects of the uncertainties of the cross sections were not investigated in this study, since they are well constrained above 5 GeV. Uncertainties on the Earth density profile were shown to have a negligible impact on the NMH determination. The effect of differences in the predictions for the energy and angular dependence of the neutrino flux, from the Honda, Bartol, and FLUKA models, was also demonstrated to be small. However, these models significantly differ in the overall flux normalization, which can result in a critical reduction of the discrimination power. This loss can be attenuated by anchoring the flux at high energies (> 20 GeV), where the dependence on the NMH is small, or by removing the dependence of the likelihood ratio test statistic on the flux normalization.",
