            "text": "Production of six pions in e + e \u2212 annihilation, studied at DM2 [1][2][3], showed a \"dip\" in the cross section at about 1.9 GeV, confirmed later by the Fermilab E687 experiment in photoproduction [4,5], and with a much larger effective integrated luminosity at BaBar [6] using initial-state radiation (ISR). Even earlier, a narrow structure near the proton-antiproton threshold was also observed in the total cross section of e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons in the FENICE experiment [7]. A measurement of the CMD-3 Collaboration [8] confirmed these observations and demonstrated that the drop in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) cross section occurred in the narrow energy range of less than 10 MeV width. The origin of the \"dip\" remains unclear, but one of the explanations suggests the presence of a below-threshold proton-antiproton (pp) resonance [9]. Alternatively, according to Refs. [10][11][12][13] the \"dip\" is due https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.05.032 0370-2693/\u00a9 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore we decided to repeat a scan of this energy range with a larger data sample and a fine step in an attempt to measure the width of the dip. In this paper we present the analysis of 50 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected with the CMD-3 detector [18] at 29 c.m. energy points at the VEPP-2000 collider with the upgraded injection complex [19][20][21][22]. While the data have been collected in the 1.5-2.0 GeV center-of-mass energy (E c.m. ) range, the scope of this paper is a detailed study of the NN threshold region. The scan of the NN-threshold energy range was performed with a fine step, corresponding to the c.m. energy spread. The beam energy and energy spread have been monitored by the back-scattering-laserlight system [23,24], providing an absolute energy measurement with better than 0.1 MeV uncertainty in every single measurement. During data taking the E c.m. variations around a central value did not exceed 0.1 MeV at each energy point: this value is taken as the systematic uncertainty estimate. The energy spread, \u03c3 E c.m. , is measured to be 0.95\u00b10.10 MeV at the NN threshold: the added uncertainty is our estimate of a systematic effect with a negligible contribution of the statistics.",

[8], we have a background-free sample of the six-track signal events, and use the ratio of the five-and six-track events to correct the efficiency. With the new data sample, the number of signal events with six charged tracks increased to 10155 (compared to 2887 events in the previous analysis) and that with one missing track to 17822 (5069) events. The cross section obtained from the new data is shown in Fig. 1 by squares, while the BaBar [6] and previous CMD-3 [8] data are shown by open and closed circles, respectively. Our previous result is confirmed with better statistical accuracy, while a systematic uncertainty is estimated at the same 6% level, mostly dominated by the uncertainties in the efficiency and background estimate. The \"dip\" at the NN threshold is also confirmed and is studied in more detail (see below).",

For the new data we have reproduced all steps for selection of four charged tracks, pion-kaon separation procedure, and the calculation of the efficiency and radiative corrections. A specially designed likelihood function is used to separate kaons and pions. In this analysis we use events with exactly four charged tracks which have practically no background. In contrast to the previous analysis, the events with one missing kaon or events with a missing pion are not used to reduce the uncertainty in the background subtraction. Nevertheless, the same overall statistical accuracy is achieved since the scan around the NN threshold is performed with large integrated luminosity that allows us to select about 1500 signal events per energy point. The cross section obtained from the new data is shown in Fig. 2 by squares, while the BaBar [27] data are shown by open circles.

At the energies near threshold, for E c.m. < 1900 MeV, protons and antiprotons from the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp stop in the material of the beam pipe because of very low momentum. To select such events, we look for the products of antiproton annihilation with more than two charged tracks coming from the aluminum beam pipe. Comparison of the calorimeter response for such events below and above the NN threshold yields the number of pp events. Points below the production thresholds, where we assume no signal from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp reaction, are used for background normalization and we obtain 490\u00b130 signal events in the energy range from the production threshold to 1900 MeV. Starting from E c.m. =1900 MeV, protons have enough energy to penetrate the beam pipe, and above this energy no annihilation of antiprotons at the beam pipe is observed. Protons and antiprotons are detected as collinear tracks with large specific energy losses, dE/dx, in the drift chamber (DC) of the CMD-3: we detect 4770 signal events. At each energy a visible cross section is calculated as the number of selected events divided by the detection efficiency and integrated luminosity. The obtained e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp visible cross section is shown in Fig. 3. We estimate the systematic uncertainty as about 10%, dominated by the uncertainty in the efficiency calculation: a special study was performed to estimate data-MC difference in the reconstruction efficiency.",

A detailed study of the NN threshold region confirms a fast drop (rise) in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) (e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp) cross section observed previously. For the first time a width of this structure is measured in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp reaction: the \u03c3 thr = 0.76 \u00b1 0.28 MeV value is smaller than the difference between the pp and nn production thresholds. The energy position of the \"dip\" in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross sections, observed for the first time, is consistent with the nn production threshold, while that for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) reaction is close to the pp threshold. No structures in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) cross section have been found at the NN threshold suggesting for a more complicated dynamics at the microscopic level, which cannot be summarized by the simple rise of the virtual nucleon-antinucleon production.",

The fit yields E thr = 1877.1 \u00b1 0.2 MeV, consistent with the pp production threshold within uncertainties in the energy measurement, and \u03c3 thr = 0.18 \u00b1 0.27 MeV.

In both cases the \u03c3 thr value and its uncertainty are smaller than the energy difference between the neutron and proton production thresholds.Fig. 3shows the visi-ble e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp cross section with the fit result (solid curve) when E thr in Born cross section (dashed curve) is fixed at 1876.54 MeV.
