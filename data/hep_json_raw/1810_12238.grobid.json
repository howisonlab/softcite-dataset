While DM has gravitational interactions with normal matter, DM particles are dark (see the sidebar titled Particle Properties of Dark Matter); nongravitational interactions of DM must be relatively rare. DM is very stable, with a lifetime comparable to that of the Universe (e.g., 2). It is also nonrelativistic and collisionless. But most striking is its abundance at the present day [relic abundance (3)], extracted from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (4). There is approximately five times as much DM as the matter described by the Standard Model. This fact provides one of the few quantitative clues about BSM physics, and suggests that the complexity of the DM particle sector could match or exceed that of ordinary matter.",

This is one of the main signatures of DM in colliders. 2. Very long lifetime: If DM is a particle, it does not seem to decay. Conservation laws, such as those implied by Z2 symmetry [e.g., R parity in supersymmetry (SUSY)], can prevent the DM particle from decaying into any lighter even-parity Standard Model particle.

In some situations, such as when a BSM mediator is heavy compared with the collision energy, the DM-Standard Model interaction appears to be a contact interaction. All observables are completely determined by one rate parameter, the contact interaction scale, that controls the production rate, and a Lorentz structure, which has a modest effect on the transverse momentum (pT) distributions of the invisible particles. In this case, effective field theories (EFTs) (20-23) describe the production of invisible particles. Figure 1a depicts an EFT process. One may hope that such a description is sufficient for the LHC; the unknown high-energy details of a complicated interaction are conveniently integrated out. Moreover, since EFTs do not fix a mediation mechanism, they provide a framework to systematically explore a wide range of possible physics. If, instead, the interaction physics is kinematically accessible (e.g., the mediator mass is within reach of the typical momentum transfer in the collision), one should replace the EFT description with a model specifying further details of the DM-Standard Model matter interactions (24). Without those details, however, one can still use the EFT language to obtain results for later reinterpretation once its high-energy completion is known (25, 26).",

Although these simplified models often have to be embedded in a larger theory to satisfy theory constraints (31), in many cases they are sufficient to describe the leading-order collider phenomenology. The most common models include neutral mediator particles singly produced at the LHC and decaying both to pairs of invisible particles and to pairs of Standard Model particles (Figure 1b,c). These two-body mediator decays offer simple, attractive benchmarks. Colored mediators allow vertices involving only one DM particle and phenomenology akin to that of SUSY models with a squark mediator (33)(34)(35). For additional decay signatures, for so-called dark sectors of many additional particles, and for LHC data sets far larger than at present, many more simplified models become interesting. Models of BSM mediation can be classified according to the spin of the mediator: spin-1 vector or axial-vector mediators (Z ), scalar mediators (referred to as \u03c6 below), and spin-2 mediators (36).",

The couplings of the Z boson (gq to all quarks, g to leptons, and g\u03c7 to invisible particles), the mass of the invisible particle m\u03c7, and the Z mass M med are free parameters. Lepton decays, if not included explicitly at tree level, arise through the quark coupling at loop level (see Reference 37 and references therein). Decays of the spin-1 mediator into neutrinos are also required by gauge invariance, and add an invisible decay channel that can enhance signatures of missing transverse momentum, depending on the size of the couplings (37). The spin structure of the Z couplings does not significantly change the LHC phenomenology, but it has a much greater effect in signals in noncollider searches. Figure 1b,d depicts an example process for this model for the case of invisible and visible decays, respectively. The rate of visible decays will increase quickly with increasing gq. In order to show the interplay between the constraints from visible and invisible searches in different decay channels of the mediator, LHC searches adopt different benchmark coupling scenarios (described in Reference 37 and discussed in Section 3.5.1), where the coupling to DM is set to unity, the coupling to quarks is set to either 0.25 or 0.1, and the coupling to leptons is set to 0, 0.1, or 0.01. Those choices are made on the basis of the current LHC search sensitivity (see Section 3.5.1). These coupling values also ensure that the model is still perturbative in most of the parameter space tested by LHC searches (for a discussion of unitarity and gauge invariance for these models, see Reference 31) and that the mediator width is small compared with its mass.",

Models including color-neutral scalar and pseudoscalar mediators (referred to as scalar mediators below) are analogous to the Higgs portal model, but with a BSM mediator. Figure 2c,d shows example Feynman diagrams for these cases. In comparison to the Z models, a scalar mediator model (42) has some additional peculiarities. Under MFV, the couplings of the scalar bosons to fermions are mass dependent. As with the Higgs boson, there are three consequences: (a) mediator production through loop-induced couplings to gluons (43) and associated with heavy-flavor quarks (42), (b) production cross sections that are smaller than those for vector mediators, and (c) visible decays that are dominantly to third-generation quarks.

Because the set of such models grows quickly with the number of components, and because there is no broad consensus on which models should be a priority, very few of them have been explicitly considered by LHC searches. Here, we highlight a few such models with signatures different from those of the simplified models described above.  Models with more complex flavor violation structure than the Standard Model are just as motivated as those assuming MFV. But when constructing viable non-MFV models one must carefully evaluate many experimental constraints on flavor-violating processes (49). Mediators that couple to DM and a top quark appear in one category of flavor-violating model that remains least constrained by low-energy measurements (50).

A much larger step beyond that is to consider an extended Higgs sector such as a 2HDM, in which one or more of the scalars acts as the mediator between DM and ordinary matter (44,53,54). In such models, the new mediator mixes with the Higgs partners rather than with the Standard Model Higgs boson, so the model remains compatible with Higgs measurements. Some models developed for LHC searches focus on one Yukawa structure (type II) (55). Their particle content includes two CP -even bosons (of which one is the Standard Model Higgs boson), two CP -odd bosons (of which one is the pseudoscalar DM mediator), two charged Higgs bosons, and the invisible particle.

As a result, neutrino production via the Z boson is often the largest background to searches for new invisible particles and is important to understand well. The rate of events with considerable pT is predicted by the Standard Model. The data would show a significant deviation from this prediction if the Z boson were coupled to additional invisible particles lighter than approximately half its mass. The most precise measurement of the invisible Z boson's width, 499.1 \u00b1 1.5 MeV, has been inferred from the total Z width at LEP (74). This value can be used to constrain the parameters of models such as Z portals (19,75), where the coupling between the Z boson and an invisible Dirac fermion, lighter than the Z mass, is constrained to be significantly smaller than the values necessary for a thermal relic. A less precise direct measurement of the Z boson's invisible width, also by LEP, uses invisible decays with a photon emitted as initial-state radiation (ISR), selecting events with a single photon, the total missing transverse momentum inferred from momentum balance with the visible particles ( / E T ), and little other event activity. At the LHC, precision measurements continue to test the production and decay of Z bosons for the effects of invisible particles. For example, ATLAS has measured the ratio of cross sections for jet and / E T production, dominated by invisibly decaying Z bosons, to the production of Z bosons decaying to dilepton pairs, a ratio that is sensitive to the production of additional invisible particles (76).",

One way to reduce the model dependence of DM searches at colliders is to require that the recoiling visible particles be governed by Standard Model processes, not by the dark interaction, so their relative rates and spectra are predictable with no model assumptions. ISR meets this criteria. Standard Model bosons are likely to be present in any BSM process, radiated from initial-state partons at rates fixed by the Standard Model. Because gluon ISR is far more prevalent at hadron colliders than the other forms, the jet+ / E T search is key in this approach. LHC jet+ / E T searches (91,92) typically selects collision events with a moderate amount of / E T (above roughly 200 GeV in the 13 TeV analyses in order to trigger at a manageable rate; see the sidebar titled Challenges for Triggering Low-Mass Resonances at Hadron Colliders in Section 3.5) and at least one jet with pT higher than 100-200 GeV in the central region of the detector (with pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.4). From this sample, further restrictions on additional hadronic jets and other visible particles are used to suppress contributions from Standard Model processes and from instrumental backgrounds causing spurious / E T . These requirements reduce the generality of the analysis but also better isolate signal-like events. For example, contributions from W bosons decaying to leptons are reduced by vetoing events with leptons, and top quark pair production is reduced by limiting the number of jets present. The remaining Standard Model multijet processes can exhibit high / E T when one or more jets are mismeasured. Such mismeasurements often result in / E T along the axis of a jet, and this feature is used to reduce the background to approximately 1% of the total. Noncollision events (e.g., intersecting cosmic rays, beam-gas interactions, and calorimeter problems) can also produce spurious / E T . Figure 4 shows that such events dominate a high-/ E T data sample unless they are rejected with criteria tailored to the expected collision time and detector hardware.",

The remaining uncertainties arise mainly from the identification of leptons (CMS) and the understanding of jet and / E T calibration (ATLAS). With no excesses observed, these searches set 95%-CL limits on the production cross section of invisible particles, typically ranging from 0.5 pb to 2 fb, depending on the / E T threshold. ATLAS and CMS report constraints for a selection of mediator models and parameters. These constraints are strong enough to probe (axial-)vector mediated processes, but searches are only becoming sensitive to lower cross-section scalar mediated processes. These constraints can be interpreted as limits on the interactions between the mediator and the Standard Model (e.g., gq) under specific sets of model assumptions, not on the mass and other properties of the invisible particles per se. As an example, for the simplified model with (axial-)vector mediators, mediator masses of up to 1.5-1.9 TeV are ruled out for an invisible coupling of g\u03c7 = 1 and gq = 0.25. For mediators lighter than this bound, the search can exclude Standard Model couplings of order 0.1 or, alternatively, lower g\u03c7 values than unity. With this amount of data, the searches are also becoming sensitive to lower-rate interactions mediated by scalar mediators, and the ATLAS search (91) sets explicit constraints on colored scalar mediators, where, for unit couplings and invisible particle masses of up to 100 GeV, the mass of the mediator is constrained to be above 1.7 TeV.

In models where the recoil arises from ISR, the rates for photon and electroweak boson radiation are much smaller than for gluon radiation. Nevertheless, searches in photon+ / E T and Z + / E T channels can play a complementary role alongside jet+ / E T searches, with a smaller and different mix of backgrounds and different systematic uncertainties. Both ATLAS and CMS have performed searches in each channel. With lower backgrounds, events can be recorded with lower kinematic thresholds, resulting in lower / E T and visible-pT selections. For example, the lowest / E T value probed by the Z + / E T search, where the Z decays into leptons (104,105), is around 100 GeV, versus 200 GeV for the jet+ / E T searches (e.g. (92)). These searches can play a much more powerful role when the recoil arises from the dark interaction itself rather than ISR. In these cases, photon or vector boson recoil (e.g., 82,106,107), rather than gluon recoil, may be the dominant signature. The event selection and the background estimation strategies generally mirror those of the jet+ / E T search, but vary with the type of recoil, taking advantage of the special features of the signal. Photon+ / E T searches (108,109) has lower backgrounds with respect to the jet+ / E T searches and therefore retains a comparable albeit lower sensitivity.",

This signature is similar to that of third-generation quark superpartners and can be part of dedicated SUSY searches or used for reinterpretation (117,118). SUSY searches suppress most of the tt background, matching specific models to specific, low-background signal regions.

More luminosity also provides access to new regions of parameter space for specific signatures, such as so-called compressed regions where small mass differences between superpartners cause the signals to lie buried in large backgrounds at low / E T (129,130). Small mass differences can also suppress superpartner decays, resulting in long lifetimes that can be exploited to study regions with a mass difference as low as 0.2 GeV for higgsino models (131). Other mechanisms of decay suppression can do this as well [e.g., split SUSY (132)].",

This search can use the entire sample of dimuon decays delivered to LHCb, recorded at the full collision rate directly at the trigger level (96), also placing constraints on dark bosons with longer lifetimes. Below 10 GeV, experiments at electron-positron colliders have searched for dilepton resonances or missing mass produced in association with ISR photons (e.g., 143, 144). LHCb also searches dimuon events for scalar bosons with masses between 250 MeV and 4.7 GeV (145), for a range of lifetimes. Dark bosons can also arise in Higgs decays via a hidden-sector mechanism. For example, the searches described in References 146 and 147 look for exotic Higgs decays into collimated lepton jets, constraining the decay rate to be below 10% for a range of dark photon lifetimes.

For dielectron and dimuon searches, the main backgrounds arise from Drell-Yan processes, which are estimated with simulations corrected for next-to-next-to-leading-order effects and normalized to the Z boson yield in the data. Figure 6 illustrates constraints from the dijet resonance searches mentioned above, on the quark coupling of the mediator in an axial-vector simplified model, as a function of the mediator mass, for a model that assumes no tree-level couplings to leptons. This plot is made for a particular choice of DM mass, but would look similar for other DM masses. Searches for boosted mediator decays are sensitive to masses as low as 50 GeV and quark couplings gq as low as 0.06 at 60 GeV. Jets from the mediator decay are spatially separated for mediator masses above 250-300 GeV, where the \u03b3 and gluon ISR+dijet channel constrains gq to be greater than 0.15-0. Summary of constraints from searches for narrow, light dijet resonances from ATLAS and CMS available as of July 2018, where discrete points are taken from the coupling-mass limits (as the best limit for each of the points) on a simplified model mediated by an axial-vector Z coupling exclusively to quarks from the searches mentioned in the text, and interpolated at the crossings. The coupling to leptons (g l ) is set to zero and the coupling to DM (g DM , also termed as g\u03c7 in the text) is set to unity. For this comparison of dijet searches, the Z is not allowed to decay on-shell to DM particles since the mass of the DM particle is set to 10 TeV. Couplings above the lines are excluded at 95% CL, up to the values where larger couplings yield a resonance width larger than 10-15% (roughly gq > 0.5). Abbreviation: DM, dark matter.

Recent ATLAS and CMS results depict results in a twodimensional plane of mediator mass and DM mass, following the recommendations of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group. 4  Figure 7 shows a sample of recent ATLAS plots. The remaining coupling parameters are fixed to one of several benchmark sets that are selected on the basis of the sensitivity of early Run 2 searches, precision constraints, and the complementarity of different types of searches. Figure 7 displays the constraints from dijet, dilepton, and X + / E T searches on the interaction model as excluded regions of the model parameter space. Figure 7a shows the LHC constraints in a scenario that privileges dijet decays, for couplings gq = 0.25, g = 0, and g\u03c7 = 1. In this case, dijet searches exclude mediators between approximately 200 GeV and 2.6 TeV, while X + / E T searches can constrain even lighter mediators. Figure 7b shows the exclusions for smaller quark couplings, gq = 0.1, and a nonzero lepton coupling, g = 0.01, chosen as indicative of the possible size of loop-induced lepton couplings. With lower quark couplings, and thus lower dijet production and decay rates, the regions of masses excluded by the several dijet searches shrink. For mediators heavier than 150 GeV, the exclusions from the recent dilepton search fare better but do not extend very far into the (smaller) region excluded by the jet+ / E T search, where mediator decays to DM dominate.",

One advantage of searches for invisible particles is their sensitivity to models with very light mediators (<50 GeV) and on-shell decays to DM, since the reach of dijet and dilepton searches to low-mass resonances is still ultimately limited by data-taking constraints, but they are also stronger than direct mediator searches in the case of supersymmetric models (148). Further examples of complementarity can be found in other types of models, for example, in SUSY, where striking signatures of visible particle decays (e.g. same-sign dileptons or multiresonance final states) allow for discovery before more generic multijet + / E T signatures (165). Since we do not know what DM model is realized in nature, all of these search channels are potentially relevant, and have different strengths. They are all necessary for a thorough search program.",

The LHC Dark Matter Working Group (see Reference 41 and references therein) has provided instructions for how to perform these extrapolations. For the first, partial Run 2 LHC search results, generic searches have only selected models that had an early chance of discovery for these comparisons. But many other models can be used, 5 and published searches typically provide some form of modelagnostic results for this purpose. For example, CMS and ATLAS have extrapolated the parameter exclusions obtained by a recent set of searches to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section of a DD experiment. The result for CMS is depicted in Figure 8, which shows a selection of DD results for comparison. The figure illustrates general features of many such comparisons.",

Making this link, however, requires extrapolating from the present day to the early Universe along an increasingly tenuous chain of assumptions. For simplified models, this is especially problematic, because the model is designed to describe collider-scale processes; it may not even contain higher-scale interactions relevant in the early Universe.",

For example, for the general simplified models discussed in Section 2.2.2, one can use programs such as MadDM and Mi-crOMEGas (163,184) to compute the DM abundance for a standard thermal relic, assuming that the interaction described by the simplified model is the one responsible for setting the relic density. Often (e.g., Figure 7), ATLAS and CMS supplement their results with contours indicating where within a model this procedure obtains the correct DM density of \u03c9c = 0.12h 2 . These lines should be regarded as guidance rather than as strict requirements for the models considered. When the model cannot reproduce the correct abundance indicates either that the model requires additional components beyond those included in the simplified model or that the chain of assumptions is incorrect (12).",

Our understanding of collider search targets is also rapidly improving.
