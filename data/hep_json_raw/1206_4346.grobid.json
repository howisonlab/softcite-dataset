            "text": "In ep collisions at HERA beauty quarks are mainly produced as bb pairs via the fusion of a quasi-real photon emitted by the incoming electron (or positron) and a gluon of the proton as depicted in Fig. 1a. This process is referred to as direct or pointlike and can be calculated using perturbative  Fig. 1 Generic leading order diagrams for bb production in ep collisions. The diagram (a) is referred to as direct or pointlike, the diagram (b) is referred to as resolved or hadronlike quantum chromodynamics (QCD) due to the large scale provided by the mass of the heavy b-quark and the correspondingly small coupling \u03b1 s . Resolved processes where the photon fluctuates into a hadronic state before undergoing a hard collision, as indicated in Fig. 1b, are expected to be largely suppressed compared to the direct production process, because of the large b-quark mass. Due to the dominance of the direct process over the resolved process, the production of b-quarks in ep collisions at HERA is an excellent testing ground for QCD predictions.",

In general the predictions using the factorisation and renormalisation scale \u03bc R = \u03bc F = m 2 b + P T (b) 2 do not agree well with the data. In particular at low values of the transverse momentum of the beauty quarks P T (b) \u2248 0 GeV, i.e. in the phase space region where the only hard scale involved is the b-quark mass m b , the measurements show a tendency to lie above the prediction. The choice of a lower scale, \u03bc R = \u03bc F = 1/2 m 2 b + P T (b) 2 , leads to a better agreement of the prediction with the data [16].",

Jet-based b-tagging algorithms are in general very efficient at high transverse momenta of b-quarks, P T (b) > 6 \u2212 7 GeV, but degrade significantly for lower values due to the absence of the boost and the short decay length. In addition b-quarks almost at rest lead to isotropic decay topologies of the final state where jet finders usually fail. A second class of analyses used double tags to select bb pairs either by reconstructing two muons [8] or a muon and a D * meson [3,10], utilising the semileptonic decay channel b \u2192 \u03bcX and the decay channel b \u2192 D * X , respectively. Lower values of the transverse momentum of the b-quarks become accessible by the use of lepton tags without requiring jets, where the minimum P T (b) value is determined by the minimum transverse momentum cut on the lepton. For muons this cut is typically at P T (\u03bc) \u2248 2 GeV, and therefore too high to measure efficiently the production cross sections of b-quarks near threshold.",

Two estimators, D calo and D dE/dx , are defined to discriminate electrons from background. The background, which is mainly due to pions misidentified as electrons and to a lesser extent due to kaons and anti-protons, is largely suppressed by combining the two independent estimators into a combined estimator D ele , as explained in Appendix A. The three estimators are defined such that D = 1 for genuine electrons and D = 0 for pion background. The calorimeter based electron identification [61] is track seeded, which means the cluster shape estimators are calculated from energy deposits in LAr calorimeter cells lying within a cylinder of 30 cm around the extrapolated track trajectory. The cluster energies are corrected for energy losses in the dead material in front of the LAr calorimeter. Electron candidates with energy depositions close to inactive regions between LAr calorimeter modules are rejected. Five estimators are defined: four cluster shape variables and the ratio of the energy deposited in the electromagnetic part of the LAr calorimeter to the momentum of the corresponding track. These estimators together with the logarithm of the total energy and the z position of the cluster, are mapped onto one single estimator D calo using the artificial neural network Multilayer Perceptron [64].",
