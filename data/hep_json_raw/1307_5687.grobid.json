            "text": "Recently we have published a short paper on upper limits on an additional neutrino mass eigenstate in 2 to 100 eV region [1] obtained after reanalysis of our data on the direct electron antineutrino mass measurements in Tritium \u03b2-decay in the Troitsk nu-mass experiment [2]. The group led by V. M. Lobashev took these data in the period of 1997-2004. The same file set and the same analysis framework as for the electron anti neutrino mass were used. A search was performed for any sign of an additional neutrino mass state in the \u03b2-electron spectrum. Such a state with a finite mass would exhibit itself as a kink in the spectrum. The analysis drew much attention to the fact how data were analyzed, how systematic errors were estimated and why our limits appeared to be by a factor of 2-3 better than those from the similar analysis for Mainz data [3]. Here we present all details of the analysis and make a direct comparison with Mainz results.",

For small \u2206E (the difference between the upper and lower boundaries \u00b14\u03c3 for parameter E 0 is about 0.4 eV for each single run) the dependence on the endpoint energy E 0 can be described as I(E, E 0 ) = I(E + \u2206E, E 0 + \u2206E).

In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the difference of the integrated likelihood functions for masses 2 eV, 3 eV and 10 eV are shown at nominal and shifted by a +3% source thickness, thus it gives a conservative estimation. Doing a \u00b13% variation of the source thickness we select the largest variation. The average shift of the upper limit in systematics estimation procedure is about 12%. At 95% the shift of the upper limit of the confidence level (the curve crossing with the horizontal line at 0.95) is rather small even for a conservative systematic influence estimation. The effect of other systematic parameters is even less. It is clearly seen in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, where changes of the likelihood function by varying systematic parameters are shown for two experimental runs. The reasonable question is why systematic effect from the source thickness has little influece on the upper limit of an additional heavy mass while for the electron antineutrino mass, m e , published in ref. [2] it is comparable with the statistical errors (in ref. [2] for the square of the effective mass we got a statistical error of 1.89 eV 2 and a systematical error from the source thickness of the order of 1.68 eV 2 )? The general answer is that we use two different functions to describe the spectrum shape for the case of electron neutrino mass and for the case when light mass is assigned to zero with an additional component for the heavy mass admixture. All systematic errors contribute differently and therefore the effect, say, of the source thickness can be different.",

The direct fit approach is somewhat easier to use in most cases because it requires to calculate likelihood or \u03c7 2 functions only few times instead of covering the whole many-dimensional region of parameters. The weakness of such a method is that one needs to add an additional information by providing fit function extension to the unphysical region. Another flaw is that most of frequentist methods provide correct estimations for errors only in the case of Gaussian likelihood shape. As it was demonstrated in Fig. 2, sometimes distributions are well beyond any reasonable shape. The Bayesian method is preferred because of its transparency from a mathematical point of view and its additional flexibility (for example it allows one to work with non-Gaussian distributions).",

In Fig. 12 Bayesian upper limits are plotted next to similar estimates by Feldman and Cousins procedure. Point by point results for standard Gaussian fit are plotted in Fig. 15 by solid dots. In Fig. 12 we also presented the sensitivity limit calculated in the same way as it was estimated in Ref. [2]: in case when the fit gives a negative value, the sensitivity limit is simply estimated by setting that value at zero and keeping the same error bars. The influence of systematic errors in calculating Feldman and Cousins upper limit is shown in Fig. 13. In this case the total span of systematic parameters (\u00b1 3% for source thickness and \u00b1 20% for trapping) was taken as a standard deviation of its distribution. The drop of systematic error for a squared mass 400 is caused by the fact that the influence of systematic parameters changes its sign in this region (for small masses an increase at source thickness causes an increase in U 2 , but for higher masses the effect is reverse). As one can see, the systematic uncertainly is in the range of 0.8-0.9 of the statistical error. Thus, the total uncertainty increases by factor 1.3-1.35.",

The reasonable question is why our heavy neutrino results are so different while the estimations of light electron neutrinos are similar. The first reason is that we have set of dissimilar systematic uncertainties. The systematic error of our experiment comes mostly from the uncertainty of the effective thickness of our gaseous source. As we have already shown the change of the spectrum shape due to the change of the source thickness does not give a large effect on heavy mass mixing estimations. We can't speculate about the systematics of the Mainz experiment but from the resulting figure and table 1 in [3] their errors seem to come mostly from some uncertainties in the quench-condensed source. The spectrum distortion from these sources is definitely different compared to that from a change of gaseous source thickness. The second reason is some difference in statistical errors. Again, we can not make any assumption on the amount of data in Mainz analysis but we have also performed frequentist analysis and present the results in terms of Gaussian average values and errors. We reanalyzed Troitsk data in the same manner as the Mainz Neutrino group [3] did, Fig. 15. Comparing our statistical and systematic errors with those taken from Figure 4 in [3], we see that in most cases we have better a statistical precision and lower systematic influence. To make an exact comparison, in Fig. 16 the 90% C. L. upper limits obtained by Feldman and Cousins approach are plotted for both experiments using points from Fig. 15. It confirms that the difference is still there, regardless of the analysis method which has been used.",

The same data set and the analysis framework of the direct electron antineutrino mass measurements in tritium \u03b2-decay in Troitsk were used. The maximum likelihood method was applied to evaluate a possible contribution of the heavy extra mass state m 4 and its amplitude U 2 e4 . Smallness in difference for three active neutrino masses allows one to assume that all three active neutrinos have zero masses. We constructed a four-dimensional likelihood function L(U 2 e4 , E 0 , N, bkg), which evaluates the \u03b2-electron spectrum. Then, likelihood function was marginalized over all nonessential parameters by integrating them over 3-dimensions:",

The final posterior probability L for parameter U 2 e4 is calculated as a product of probabilities L k for different experimental runs. To estimate a 95% C.L. for parameter U 2 e4 , L was then integrated over a U 2 e4 to find the range containing 0.95 of the total area under L. Systematic errors were estimated for three major sources of the experimental uncertainties: effective thickness of the gaseous tritium source, usage of different final states spectrum for decay daughter molecule of T 3 He, uncertainty of 20% in the electron trapping effect in the tritium source parameter. Interestingly, contributions from these systematic errors are small and do not exceed 15-20% (for a normal systematic estimation procedure). Finally, all likelihood functions for U 2 at different values of additional mass eigenstate m 4 were presented and relevant upper limits at a 95% C.L. were calculated. At the range of m 4 from 20 eV to 100 eV the upper limit stays between 0.01 and 0.005. As expected, for masses 2-3 eV the sensitivity is poor, at larger masses the limit goes down. To check consistency of the maximum likelihood method with the previously used analysis method, we evaluated an upper limit for electron antineutrino mass with the current method and found a good agreement with the previously published value. Current errors for U 2 e4 were also estimated based on our previous measurements for electron antineutrino mass. At small m 2 4 good agreement was observed. In the end, a comparison with recent Mainz result has been done. There can be at least two reasons why our result is about two times better. In our case, under assumption that active neutrino mass is zero, systematic uncertainties have smaller effect on an additional heavy mass. At the same time, in analysis for Mainz data systematic uncertainties almost double the total error bars. The comparison of statistical errors also gives some favor to our result.",
