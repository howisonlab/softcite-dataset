The CLEO-c detector is described in detail elsewhere [8]. Monte Carlo simulated samples of signal decays are used to estimate selection efficiencies. Possible background contributions are determined from a generic D 0 D 0 simulated sample corresponding to approximately fifteen times the integrated luminosity of the data set. The EVTGEN generator [9] is used to simulate the decays. The detector response is modelled using the GEANT software package [10]. Table 1 lists the D-meson final states considered in the analysis. Double-tag candidates are reconstructed in which one D meson decays into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and the other into a CP eigenstate, or where one D meson decays into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 or K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and the other into one of the mixed-CP modes",

The result, F 4\u03c0 + = 0.737 \u00b10.028, when considered alongside the relatively high branching fraction, indicates that this channel is a valuable addition to the suite of D decays that can be harnessed for the measurement of the unitarity-triangle angle \u03b3 through the process B \u2213 \u2192 D K \u00b1 . The decays D \u2192 K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 have also been employed as a tag to measure the CP contents of the modes D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and D \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The results confirm the conclusion of a previous analysis [1], based on CP-eigenstate tags, and also suggested by earlier amplitude-model studies [24][25][26], that the CP-even content of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state is very high, and therefore this decay too is a powerful mode for the measurement of \u03b3 . Combining the two sets of measurements yields F \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 0 + = 0.973 \u00b1 0.017 and F K K \u03c0 0 + = 0.732 \u00b1 0.055. Now that their CP-even fractions have been measured, all three decay modes may also be used for studies of indirect CP violation and mixing in the D 0 D 0 system [5].",

The K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 measurements confirm the results of the earlier analysis. A combination is performed, accounting for the sole source of correlated uncertainties, which is that arising from the non-uniform acceptance over the Dalitz plots. Results of F \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 0 + = 0.973 \u00b1 0.017 and F K K \u03c0 0 + = 0.732 \u00b1 0.055 are obtained. The K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 tags improve the relative precision on F \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 0 + by 6% and on F K K \u03c0 0 + by 10%.",

The m bc and E distributions of correctly reconstructed D-meson candidates peak at the nominal D 0 mass and zero, respectively. Neither E nor m bc distributions exhibit any peaking structure for combinatoric background. The double-tag yield is determined from counting events in signal and sideband regions of m bc after placing requirements on E [1,11-13]. The selection criteria of candidates involving the modes D \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 do not include the cosmic ray muon and radiative Bhabha vetoes that are described in Ref. [1]. This is because these sources of background do not contaminate the double-tag sample, and the vetoes are found to perturb the selection efficiency of the other D meson in the event.
