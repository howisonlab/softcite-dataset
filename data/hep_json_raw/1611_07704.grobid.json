For example, in minimal supersymmetric models (MSSM), the decay can proceed via new scalar S and pseudoscalar P sgoldstino particles, which both decay into a dimuon final state as shown in figure 1(b). There are two types of couplings between sgoldstinos and SM fermions. Type-I couplings describe interactions between a sgoldstino and two fermions, where the coupling strength is proportional to the fermion mass. Type-II couplings describe a four-particle vertex, where a scalar and a pseudoscalar sgoldstino interact with two fermions. Branching fractions up to B(B 0 s \u2192 SP ) \u2248 10 \u22124 and B(B 0 \u2192 SP ) \u2248 10 \u22127 are possible [2]. Sgoldstinos can decay into a pair of photons or a pair of charged leptons [3]. In this analysis the muonic decay is considered, as the coupling to electrons is smaller and the large \u03c4 -lepton mass limits the available phase space. The branching fractions of the sgoldstino decays strongly depend on the model parameters such as the sgoldstino mass and the supersymmetry breaking scale. In the search for \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays the HyperCP collaboration found an excess of events, JHEP03(2017)001  which is consistent with the decay \u03a3 + \u2192 P p with P \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and a pseudoscalar mass of m(P ) = 214.3 \u00b1 0.5 MeV [4].",

Potentially contributing sgoldstinos are assumed to be short lived, such that they do not form a displaced vertex. The analysed data correspond to integrated luminosities of 1 and 2 fb \u22121 collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The branching fraction is measured relative to the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K + , which gives a clean signal with a precisely measured branching fraction [6]. This yields a significant improvement compared to the previous measurement, where the use of the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decay as normalisation mode resulted in a large systematic uncertainty originating from the S-wave fraction and the less precisely measured branching fraction. The advantage of normalising to a well-known B meson decay is that dominant systematic uncertainties originating mainly from the bb cross-section cancel in the ratio.",

Extrapolating and integrating the fitted function in \u00b140 MeV/c 2 wide windows around the B 0 (s) meson masses yields the number of expected background events, The statistical uncertainty is the combination of the Poissonian uncertainty originating from the limited size of the data sample and the uncertainty on the fit parameters. As an alternative fit model a second-order polynomial is used and the difference between these background expectations is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.",

In addition, the sensitivity to a specific MSSM scenario has been probed. The applied selection focuses on finding four muon tracks that form a common vertex. For the SM scenario and the MSSM decay through short-lived scalar and pseudoscalar new particles, the limits set by the previous measurement performed by LHCb on a subset of the present data, are improved by a factor of 6.4 (7.3) for the SM (MSSM) mode in the case of the B 0 s decay and by a factor of 9.5 (10.5) in the case of the B 0 decay.
