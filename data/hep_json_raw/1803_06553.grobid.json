The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), using the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes production of the Higgs boson in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into \u03c4 leptons and the cross section for the production via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks. These limits range from 18 pb at 90 GeV to 3.5 fb at 3.2 TeV for gluon fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5 fb (at 3.2 TeV) for production in association with b quarks, assuming a narrow width resonance. In the m mod+ h scenario these limits translate into a 95% CL exclusion of tan \u03b2 > 6 for neutral Higgs boson masses below 250 GeV, where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets. The 95% CL exclusion contour reaches 1.6 TeV for tan \u03b2 = 60.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson at the CERN LHC in 2012 [1][2][3] has provided evidence that spontaneous symmetry breaking, as proposed by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism [4][5][6][7][8][9], may indeed be realized in nature. The determination of the properties of the new particle, based on the complete LHC Run-1 data set [10,11], has revealed its consistency with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, within the experimental accuracy. However several questions remain, concerning, for example, the underlying mechanism responsible for the symmetry breaking, or the exact form of the potential that breaks the symmetry. To address these questions one of the main tasks of the LHC is the further exploration of the Higgs sector. This includes the search for more complex structures, for example, in the form of more than one Higgs doublet. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [12,13] is an example of a -1 - Diagrams for the production of neutral Higgs bosons (left) via gluon fusion and (middle and right) in association with b quarks. In supersymmetric extensions of the SM, the super-partners also contribute to the fermion loop, shown in the left panel. In the middle panel a pair of b quarks is produced from two gluons (the LO process in the four-flavor scheme). In the right panel the Higgs boson is radiated from a b quark in the proton (the LO process in the five-flavor scheme).",

In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [14,15] each particle of the SM is complemented by a SUSY partner, which has the same properties apart from its spin. The Higgs sector of the MSSM consists of two complex Higgs doublets, H u and H d , to provide masses for up-and downtype fermions. In the CP-conserving MSSM this leads to the prediction of five physical Higgs bosons: two charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 , two neutral scalar Higgs bosons h and H (with masses m h < m H ) and one neutral pseudoscalar Higgs boson A. At tree-level in the MSSM, the masses of these five Higgs bosons and their mixing can be expressed in terms of the gauge boson masses and two additional parameters, which can be chosen as the mass of the A, m A , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets",

The enhanced coupling to down-type fermions makes searches for additional heavy neutral Higgs bosons that exploit final states containing such fermions particularly interesting. It also has consequences for the production: firstly, the production in association with b quarks dominates over the production via gluon fusion for large values of tan \u03b2. Secondly, in gluon fusion production the kinematic properties of the Higgs boson change as a function of tan \u03b2 due to the increasing contribution of b quarks in the fermion loop.

The analysis is performed in four different \u03c4 \u03c4 final states: e\u00b5, e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , where e, \u00b5 and \u03c4 h indicate \u03c4 lepton decays into electrons, muons and hadrons respectively. For this analysis the most significant backgrounds are estimated from data, by using new techniques with respect to previous publications by CMS. Upper limits are presented on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into \u03c4 leptons and the cross section for the production of a single narrow resonance via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks. In addition, exclusion contours in the m Atan \u03b2 plane in selected MSSM benchmark scenarios are provided.",

During the 2016 data taking period the CMS experiment was operating with, on average, 23 inelastic pp collisions per bunch crossing. The fully recorded data of a bunch crossing defines an event for further processing. Collision vertices are obtained from reconstructed tracks using a deterministic annealing algorithm [40]. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects for this purpose are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [41,42], as described below, with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. Any other collision vertices in the event are associated with additional soft inelastic pp collisions called pileup.",

To increase their purity, reconstructed electrons are required to pass a multivariate electron identification discriminant, which combines information on track quality, shower shape, and kinematic quantities. For this analysis working points with an efficiency between 80 and 90% are used to identify electrons. Muons in the event are reconstructed by performing a simultaneous track fit to hits in the tracker and in the muon chambers [35]. The presence of hits in the muon chambers already leads to a strong JHEP09(2018)007 suppression of particles misidentified as muons. Additional identification requirements on the track fit quality and the compatibility of individual track segments with the fitted track can reduce the misidentification rate further. For this analysis muon identification requirements with an efficiency of \u224899% are chosen. The contribution from backgrounds to the electron (muon) selection is further reduced by requiring the corresponding lepton to be isolated from any hadronic activity in the detector. This property is quantified by a relative isolation variable I e(\u00b5) rel , which starts from the sum of the transverse momentum (energy) of all charged (neutral) particles, I e(\u00b5) abs = ( p T,i + E T,i ) in a predefined cone of radius \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 around the lepton direction at the primary collision vertex, where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 (measured in radians) correspond to the angular distance of the particle to the lepton in the \u03b7 and \u03c6 directions. The chosen cone size is \u2206R < 0.3 (0.4) for electrons (muons). The lepton itself is not included in this calculation. To mitigate any distortions from pileup only those charged particles whose tracks are associated with the primary collision vertex are taken into account. The presence of neutral particles from pileup is estimated by summing the p T of charged particles in the isolation cone whose tracks have been associated to pileup vertices, and multiplying this quantity by a factor of 0.5 to account for the approximate ratio of neutral to charged hadron production. The value obtained is subtracted from I e(\u00b5) abs and the result set to zero in case of negative values. Finally, I",

For further characterization of the event all reconstructed PF objects are clustered into jets using the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm as implemented in fastjet [41,42] with a distance parameter of 0.4. To identify jets resulting from the hadronization of b quarks a re-optimized version of the combined secondary vertex b tagging algorithm, which exploits information from the decay vertices of long-lived hadrons, and the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, in a combined discriminant, is used [43]. In the analysis a working point corresponding to a b jet identification efficiency of \u224870% and a misidentification rate for light quarks and gluons of 1% is chosen. Jets are also used as seeds for the reconstruction of hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays. This is done by further exploiting the substructure of the jets, using the hadrons-plus-strips algorithm, as described in refs. [44,45]. For the analysis the decay into three charged hadrons and the decay into a single charged hadron accompanied by up to two neutral pions with p T > 2.5 GeV are used. The neutral pions are reconstructed as strips with dynamic size from reconstructed electrons and photons contained in the seeding jet, where the strip size varies as a function of the p T of the electron or photon candidate. The hadronic \u03c4 decay mode is then obtained by combining the charged hadrons with the strips. Since they do not carry color charge, high-p T \u03c4 leptons are expected to be isolated from any hadronic activity in the event as are high-p T electrons and muons. Furthermore, in accordance with its finite lifetime the charged decay products of the \u03c4 lepton are expected to be slightly displaced from the primary collision vertex. To distinguish hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays from jets originating from the hadronization of quarks or gluons a multivariate \u03c4 h identification discriminant is used [44]. It combines information on the hadronic activity in the detector in the vicinity of the \u03c4 h candidate with the reconstructed lifetime information from the tracks of the charged decay products. Of the predefined working points in ref. [44] this analysis makes use of the Tight, Medium, and -5 -",

The most obvious background originates from Z boson production in the \u03c4 \u03c4 final state (Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ). Since the analysis is not sensitive to the CP-eigenvalue or spin of the Higgs boson, the signal can be distinguished from this background only by the difference in mass of the associated bosons. The same is true for Z \u2192 events, where refers to an electron or muon, if one of the leptons is misidentified as a hadronic \u03c4 lepton decay. Similar arguments hold for tt production (a dominant background especially in the e\u00b5 final state), the production of single t quarks and vector boson pair production (WW, WZ, and ZZ). Common to all these backgrounds in the e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states is that they can be misinterpreted as signal events in two ways: firstly, if the final state contains one or more genuine \u03c4 leptons or if an electron or muon in the final state is misinterpreted as a hadronic \u03c4 lepton decay, and secondly, if one or more jets are misinterpreted as hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays. In table 2 the former is labeled as \"\u03c4 / \u2192 \u03c4 h \", whilst the latter is labeled as \"jet \u2192 \u03c4 h \". Typical misidentification probabilities are given in section 3.

The further splitting of the processes in the second column refers only to final states that contain a \u03c4 h candidate. The label \"MC\" implies that the process is taken from simulation; the label \"F F \" implies that the process is determined from data using the fake factor method, as described in section 5.2. The label \"CR\" implies that both the shape and normalization of QCD multijet events are estimated from control regions in data. The symbol corresponds to an electron or muon. signal purity supplementary samples are generated with up to four outgoing partons in the hard interaction. For diboson production MadGraph5 amc@nlo is used at next-toleading order (NLO) precision. For tt and single t quark production samples are generated at NLO precision using powheg 2.0 [49][50][51][52][53][54]. For the interpretation of the results the expected contribution of the SM Higgs boson is taken into account; this process is simulated using powheg separately for the production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion (VBF), or in association with a Z (ZH) or W (WH) boson. When compared to data and not modified by a control measurement in data, Drell-Yan, W+jets, tt, and single t quark events in the tW-channel are normalized to their cross sections at next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) precision [55][56][57]. Single t quark production in the t-channel and diboson events are normalized to their cross sections at NLO precision [57,58]. The gluon fusion signal process is simulated at LO precision using pythia 8.212 [59]. For the statistical analysis the Higgs boson p T distribution is weighted to NLO precision using powheg. To account for the multiscale nature of the process in the NLO plus parton shower powheg prediction, the p T spectra corresponding to the contributions from the t quark alone, the b quark alone and the tb-interference are each calculated separately, using a powheg damping factor set to the individual scales as discussed in refs.

For the signal extraction, the shape and normalization of these backgrounds are estimated from control regions in data, using the \"fake factor\" method, as described in ref. [67]. In this approach the number of events for a certain background i due to jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification is estimated from a region that only differs from the signal region (SR) by modifying the \u03c4 h identification requirement. This region is referred to as the application region (AR). For this purpose the \u03c4 h identification is required to fulfill the VeryLoose but not the Tight (Medium) working point of the discriminant in the e\u03c4 h /\u00b5\u03c4 h (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h ) final state. This region is primarily populated by events with jets misidentified as hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays, with typical fractions of genuine \u03c4 lepton decays at the level of a few percent or below. To arrive at an estimate for the number of events from background i due to jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification in the SR the number of events in the AR is then multiplied by the ratio   working point of the \u03c4 h identification discriminant. The number of events appearing in eq. (5.1) is obtained from a dedicated determination region (DR i ), which is orthogonal to the AR and SR, and dominated by background i. The contributions from backgrounds other than i are estimated from simulation and subtracted from the numerator and denominator of eq. (5.1). For this purpose all corrections as described in section 5.3 are applied to the simulation. The F i F can be different for different processes, for example, if the misidentified jet predominantly originates from a heavy flavor quark, a light flavor quark or gluon fragmentation.",

This can be ensured by determining F i F differentially as a function of several variables taking the most important kinematic or topological dependencies into account. Residual biases can be removed by adequate corrections, which can be determined from independent control regions or from simulation. For the analysis the F i F are estimated from a fit to the measured values of F i F , as a function of the p T of the \u03c4 h candidate in categories of the \u03c4 h decay mode, and the jet multiplicity, in bins of N jet = 0 or N jet \u2265 1. This is in general done in three dedicated and exclusive DR i for the backgrounds due to QCD multijet, W+jets, and tt events. From the individually determined F i F a weighted factor F F is then obtained on an event-by-event basis from 2) where N i AR corresponds to the expected number of events for background i in the AR. The factor F F is then applied to all events in the AR to obtain an estimate for the number and shape of the sum of QCD multijet, W+jets, and tt events due to jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification. For this purpose the subdominant contributions from Z \u2192 , diboson and single t quark events are subsumed into the W+jets estimate. The estimates for N W+jets AR and N tt AR are taken from the simulation. The estimate for N QCD AR is obtained from the events in the AR after subtracting all other backgrounds. These estimates are cross-checked using a template fit to the data in the AR equivalent to the fit described in section 6, but with the p \u03c4 h T distribution as the input shape. From the resulting distributions, the expected contribution from events with genuine hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays or electrons or muons misidentified as hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays are subtracted using the simulation. The principle of the method is outlined in figure 4. The final state specific parts of the application of this method in the e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states are described in the following.",

Therefore only DR QCD is defined from the single requirement that the electric charges of the \u03c4 \u03c4 pair should be of the same sign. The F QCD F are then also used to estimate the background from W+jets and tt events. Secondly, misidentified \u03c4 h candidates from QCD multijet production usually originate from jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification. In this way a combinatorial effect arises for the determination of F QCD F from the fact that each event can enter the AR in one of two mutually exclusive ways, either if the leading \u03c4 h candidate fulfills the nominal \u03c4 h identification requirement and the subleading \u03c4 h candidate the inverted requirement or vice versa. This combinatorial effect is taken into account by assigning a weight of 0.5 to these types of events. For the backgrounds from W+jets and tt events typically only one of the reconstructed \u03c4 h candidates originates from a misidentified jet and the other one from a genuine \u03c4 lepton decay. The fraction of events with two misidentified jets is at most a few percent and thus well below the associated systematic uncertainties.

These corrections are usually not larger than 10 to 15%. Residual data-to-simulation corrections are applied to the simulated samples. They usually range between sub-percent level at high jet p T in the central part of the detector to a few percent in the forward region. A correction is applied to the direction and magnitude of the p miss T vector based on the differences between the estimates of the hadronic recoil in Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events in data and simulation. This correction is applied to Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , W+jets, and signal events, where a well-defined direction and magnitude of genuine p miss T can be defined. The efficiency for genuine and misidentified b jets to pass the Medium working point of the b tagging discriminator is determined from data, using tt events for genuine b jets and Z+jets events for jets predominantly originating from light-flavor quarks. Data-to-simulation corrections are obtained for these efficiencies and used to correct the number of b jets in the simulation, which translates into the number of events in the global b-tag and no b-tag event categories. In the e\u00b5 final state data-to-simulation corrections are derived for the rate at which jets are misidentified as an electron or muon. These are determined as a function of the jet p T from Z+jets events in the Z \u2192 decay. They are applied to W+jets and diboson events, which form more than 90% of the expected background due to jet \u2192 misidentification in the e\u00b5 final state, and where the flavor composition of jets is similar to that in the region in which the corrections are determined. Corrections are further applied to Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events in the \u00b5\u03c4 h and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states in which a muon is reconstructed as a \u03c4 h candidate and in Z \u2192 ee events in the e\u03c4 h and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states in which an electron is reconstructed as a \u03c4 h candidate, to account for residual differences in the \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification rate between data and simulation.

From the events in this control region all other expected backgrounds are subtracted using the normalization and shape information for the final discriminating variable distribution from simulation, with the exception of the normalization of W+jets events, which is obtained as described above. The extrapolation factors (f OS/SS QCD ) from the SS to OS selection are obtained from control regions, where in addition, to the corresponding charge requirement, the isolation requirement on the electron or muon is inverted. The extrapolation factors JHEP09 (2018)007are then obtained from a fit to the data in the control regions similar to the one described in section 6. To control the normalization of the W+jets and QCD multijet events the eight additional control regions per final state, as introduced above, are added to the fit for the signal extraction and the corresponding normalization uncertainties are incorporated into a modified uncertainty model. In a second cross-check the background from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events in the main analysis is replaced with the prediction obtained from the \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 embedding method as used during the LHC Run-1 analyses and described, for example, in refs. [70,71]. In this process Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events are selected in data. The muons are then replaced by simulated \u03c4 lepton decays with the same kinematic properties as the reconstructed muons. In this way the method relies only on the simulation of the well understood \u03c4 lepton decay while all other parts of the event are obtained from data. As a consequence several data-to-simulation corrections as described in section 5.3, which are of particular importance for the event categorization as well as for the shape of the final discriminating variable distribution, do not need to be applied for this process. This applies, for example, to corrections of the jet energy scale, b tagging efficiency, and p miss T . This cross-check is applied in the e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states individually. Both the extrapolation factors from the inclusive event selection into the event subcategories, as well as the shapes of the final discriminating variable distribution for the signal extraction, as obtained from the simulation, are found to be in good agreement with the estimates as obtained from the embedding method, within the estimated uncertainties. In addition the uncertainties that are related to the experimental aspects of the \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 embedding, which are orthogonal to the uncertainties in the estimate from simulation, are incorporated into a modified uncertainty model to replace several uncertainties for the estimate based on the simulation.",

In figure 7 these limits are shown as a function of m \u03c6 . For the determination of the limit on one process, e.g., gluon fusion, the normalization for JHEP09(2018)007 the corresponding other process, e.g., associated production with b quarks, is treated as a freely varying parameter in the signal-plus-background fit that is performed prior to the limit calculation. The expectation for an SM Higgs boson at 125 GeV is taken into account in the SM backgrounds. For both production modes the p T spectrum of the \u03c6 is estimated at NLO precision in \u03b1 s , as described in section 5.1. Differences in the sensitivity of the analysis only occur at low masses, where the p T of the \u03c6 significantly contributes to the p T of its decay products. In the figure this is emphasized by adding the median for the expected limit using either only the b quark or only the t quark for the modeling of the \u03c6 p T spectrum. For the production via gluon fusion the expected limits range between 18 pb at m \u03c6 = 90 GeV and 3.5 fb at m \u03c6 = 3.2 TeV. For the production in association with b quarks they range between 15 pb (at m \u03c6 = 90 GeV) and 2.5 fb (at m \u03c6 = 3.2 TeV). In both cases, the excluded cross section falls with increasing mass, before becoming constant at around 1 TeV. No significant deviation from the expectation is observed. When restricted to the e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , or \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state, the results obtained from the cross-checks summarized in section 5.4 are compatible with the results obtained from the main analysis described in this paper. A scan of the likelihood for this signal model is also performed, as a function of the gluon fusion cross section and the cross section for the associated production with b quarks, for the tested mass points. A representative subset of this likelihood scan at six mass points is shown in figure 8.",

Apart from small phase space regions, the m mod+ h scenario is compatible with the observation of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, which is interpreted as the h within the theoretical uncertainties in m h of \u00b13 GeV [87,88]. The phenomenological hMSSM also incorporates the observed Higgs boson with a fixed mass of 125 GeV, interpreting it as the h. The uncertainties in the mass measurement are then used in turn to estimate the main radiative corrections to predict the masses and couplings of the remaining MSSM Higgs bosons. For the determination of the exclusion contours the model predictions as provided by the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [76,89] are used. Inclusive cross sections for the production via gluon fusion are calculated using the program SusHi (v1.4.1) [90], including NLO QCD corrections in the context of the MSSM [91][92][93][94][95][96], as well as NNLO QCD corrections for the top quark contribution to the fermion loop in the heavy top quark limit [97][98][99][100][101], and electroweak effects from light quarks [102,103]. For associated production with b quarks four-flavor scheme NLO QCD calculations [104,105] and five-flavor scheme NNLO QCD calculations, as implemented in SusHi based on bbh@nnlo [106], are combined using the Santander matching scheme [107]. The Higgs boson masses and mixing, and the effective Yukawa couplings for the m mod+ h scenario, are calculated using the FeynHiggs 2.10.2 [87,[108][109][110][111] code. The branching fraction of the MSSM Higgs bosons to \u03c4 leptons is calculated with FeynHiggs for the m mod+ h scenario and using the program hdecay 6.40 [112] for the hMSSM scenario.",

For each value of m A and tan \u03b2, using a fine-grain scan, a maximum likelihood fit to the data is performed under the background-only and the signal-plusbackground hypotheses using the likelihood of eq. (8.1) with a test statistic that is slightly different from eq. (8.2). The numerator remains the same, with a fixed value of \u00b5 = 1, and corresponds to the signal prediction for the given value of m A and tan \u03b2. However no signal strength parameter is included in the denominator; the model is thus fixed to the background-only prediction. Note that the SM Higgs boson is added to the non Higgs boson background processes. This turns the likelihood ratio into a comparison between the MSSM and the SM Higgs sector hypotheses, and ensures a well defined problem even when the analysis becomes sensitive to the observed Higgs boson at 125 GeV. In such a situation a test of the MSSM hypothesis against a background hypothesis ignoring the SM Higgs boson would be based on a wrong null-hypothesis. The median and confidence intervals for the expected exclusion contour are determined from pseudo-experiments. In figure 9 the observed and expected 95% CL exclusion contours for the MSSM m mod+ h and the hMSSM scenarios are shown. The exclusion contours reach up to 1.6 TeV, extending the excluded mass range by almost a factor of two in m A compared to the previous CMS publication using the same final state [18]. In both scenarios the exclusion contours extend down to values of tan \u03b2 \u2248 6 for values of m A 250 GeV. For the m mod+ h scenario, those parts of the parameter space in which m h deviates by more then \u00b13 GeV from the mass of the observed Higgs boson at 125 GeV are indicated by a red hatched area. These results are compatible with the findings of a similar search performed by the ATLAS collaboration, based on an equivalent dataset [17].",

This can be attributed to three main factors: the choice of single lepton triggers in the e\u03c4 h and \u00b5\u03c4 h final states together with the higher instantaneous luminosity leads to the need for higher p T thresholds at the trigger level and therefore reduced signal acceptance; the change of the discriminating variable from the estimate of the fully reconstructed \u03c4 \u03c4 mass to m tot T provides more sensitivity for high masses, but slightly less sensitivity for lower masses; and finally the prediction of the kinematic distributions of the signal at NLO precision reveals a generally softer p T spectrum for the gluon fusion production mode, which dominates for low values of tan \u03b2. Over the whole mass range the observed exclusion contours follow the expectation with the largest deviations still contained in the 95% confidence interval for the variation of the expected exclusion.",

No signal has been found. Modelindependent limits at 95% confidence level have been set for the production of a single narrow resonance decaying into a pair of \u03c4 leptons. These range from 18 pb at 90 GeV to 3.5 fb at 3.2 TeV for production via gluon fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5 fb (at 3.2 TeV) for production in association with b quarks. Finally 95% confidence level exclusion contours have been provided for two representative benchmark scenarios, namely the m mod+ h and the hMSSM scenarios. In these two scenarios the presence of a neutral heavy MSSM Higgs boson up to m A 250 GeV is excluded for tan \u03b2 values above 6. The exclusion contour reaches 1.6 TeV for tan \u03b2 = 60.",
