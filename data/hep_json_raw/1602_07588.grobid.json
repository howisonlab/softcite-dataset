This is evidence for the first instance of a hadronic state with valence quarks of four different flavors. The mass and natural width of this state are measured to be m = 5567.8 \u00b1 2.9 (stat) +0.9 \u22121.9 (syst) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 21.9 \u00b1 6.4 (stat) +5.0 \u22122.5 (syst) MeV/c 2 . If the decay is X(5568) \u2192 B * s \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 B 0 s \u03b3\u03c0 \u00b1 with an unseen \u03b3, m(X(5568)) will be shifted up by m(B * s ) \u2212 m(B 0 s ) \u223c 49 MeV/c 2 . This measurement is based on 10. During the last few years several resonant states that cannot be conventional quark-antiquark mesons or threequark baryons have been observed [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Taking into account the decay modes and charges of these states they may be interpreted as four-quark or five-quark states. These states have one common feature: they consist of a combination of heavy and light quarks. These discoveries open up a new era of multi-quark hadron spectroscopy. Various combinations of heavy and light mesons may be tested. One such system is the combination of the heavy B 0 s or B [bu], or a \"molecule\" of the loosely bound B and K mesons. This Letter presents a study of the B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 invariant mass spectrum using a data sample of 10.4 fb \u22121 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.",

We see a tendency for data to exceed background for m(B s \u03c0 \u00b1 ) > M X [13]. We perform a fit in the restricted range m(B 0 s \u03c0 \u00b1 ) < 5.7 GeV/c 2 (Fig. 3b) and find the fitted number of signal events to be 106 \u00b1 23, with a corresponding local statistical significance of 4.8\u03c3. The difference in yields with and without the cone cut is not fully explained by statistical fluctuations. In a subsidiary study we used empirical functions [15] for the background fitted to the sidebands in data below the X(5568) region and above the signal region up to 5.9 GeV/c 2 and found signal yields that are greater than those with the default background function and comparable to or greater than that found in the cone cut analysis. These results confirm that using a background function that agrees with data for masses above 5.7 GeV can increase the fitted signal yield above that obtained using the default background model. Additional background processes not present in our MC such as B c \u2192 B s n\u03c0 with n > 1, or other new states at higher mass, would thus have the effect of reducing the X(5568) yield for the no-cone cut case.",

The results for \u03c1 are (9.1 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b1 1.6)% and (8.2 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b1 1.6)%, respectively, with an average of (8.6 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 1.4)%. The systematic uncertainties due to B 0 s reconstruction efficiency cancel out in the ratio. The combined factor of the soft pion kinematic acceptance, reconstruction efficiency, and selection efficiency is obtained from a simulated samples of events with a spinless particle of mass equal to 5568 MeV/c 2 decaying to B 0 s and a charged pion. The pion efficiency increases with p T (B 0 s ) from (26.1 \u00b1 3.2)% to (42.1 \u00b1 6.5)% for the two p T (B 0 s ) ranges. The systematic uncertainty due to a potential difference of the soft pion reconstruction efficiency in MC and data of \u00b15% is accounted for in systematics. Within uncertainties, the production ratio \u03c1 does not depend on p T (B 0 s ). A possible interpretation of the observed structure is a four-quark state made up of a diquark-antidiquark pair. With the B 0 s \u03c0 + produced in an S wave, its quantum numbers would be J P = 0 + . Thus, the state may be a heavy analogue of the isotriplet scalar state a(980), with an s quark replaced by a b quark. Such open charm and open bottom scalar mesons are predicted in Ref. [17]. On the other hand, the state can decay through the chain B * s \u03c0 \u00b1 , B * s \u2192 B 0 s \u03b3, where the low-energy photon is not detected. In this case, the quantum numbers of this state would be J P = 1 + that would make it a counterpart to other heavy tetraquark candidates. The mass of the new state would be shifted by addition of the nominal mass difference m(B * s ) \u2212 m(B 0 s ), while its width would remain unchanged. The large difference between the mass of this state and the sum of the B d and K \u00b1 masses implies [18] that X(5568) is unlikely to be a molecular state composed of loosely bound B d and K \u00b1 mesons.",
