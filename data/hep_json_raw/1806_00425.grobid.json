Using data corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 79.8 fb \u22121 , and considering Higgs boson decays into bb, W W * , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , \u03b3 \u03b3 , and Z Z * , the observed significance is 5.8 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 4.9 standard deviations. Combined with the tt H searches using a dataset corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb \u22121 at 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV, the observed (expected) significance is 6.3 (5.1) standard deviations. Assuming Standard Model branching fractions, the total tt H production cross section at 13 TeV is measured to be 670 \u00b1 90 (stat.) +110 \u2212100 (syst.) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.",

            "text": "After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [1,2], many measurements of its properties were performed [3][4][5][6][7][8]. No significant deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions were found. A probe of fundamental interest to further explore the nature of the Higgs boson is its coupling to the top quark, the heaviest particle in the SM. Indirect measurements of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark were made by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [3], assuming no contribution from unknown particles in the gluongluon fusion (ggF) loop. A more direct test of this coupling can be performed through the production of the Higgs boson in association with a top quark pair, tt H. Using a proton-proton (pp) dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 \u00b1 0.8 fb \u22121 [9], at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV, evidence of this production mode was found in 2017 by the ATLAS Collaboration [10], with an observed (expected) significance relative to the background-only hypothesis of 4.2 (3.8) standard deviations. Combining data at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, the CMS Collaboration reported an observed (expected) significance of 5.2 (4.2) standard deviations [11]. This Letter presents results of the search for the tt H process and the measurement of the tt H production cross section using data produced in pp collisions by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded with the ATLAS detector. The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Refs. [12,13]. Compared to Ref. [10], the E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch.

Improved lepton and photon reconstruction algorithms [14] and analysis techniques are used. The updated analyses are combined with the H \u2192 bb and multilepton analyses from Refs.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Funded by SCOAP 3 .  . Two dedicated boosted decision trees (BDTs) are trained using the XGBoost package [25] to discriminate the tt H signal from the main background processes. These are non-resonant diphoton production processes, including tt production together with a photon pair. The background processes also include non-tt H Higgs boson production: mainly associated production with a single top quark t H and ggF in the Had region, and t H and associated production with a vector boson V H, where V = W , Z , in the Lep region. The tt H, ggF, vector-boson fusion (VBF), and V H production processes were simulated with Powheg+Pythia8 [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. The production of a Higgs boson in association with two b-quarks, bbH, and t H were modelled using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 [35,36]. The BDT in the Lep region is trained with simulated tt H events, and with background events from a data control region that differs from the Lep region by requiring exactly zero b-tagged jets, at least one jet, and at least one photon failing either identification or isolation requirements. This BDT uses the transverse momentum p T , the pseudorapidity \u03b7, the azimuthal angle \u03c6, and the energy E of up to four (two) leading jets (leptons) in p T . It was verified that the BDT is not sensitive to the value of the jet mass. Furthermore, the BDT uses the magnitude and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of the missing transverse momentum E miss T , the transverse momentum of each of the two photons divided by the diphoton invariant mass p T /m \u03b3 \u03b3 , as well as the \u03b7 and \u03c6 of each photon. The BDT in the Had region is also trained with simulated tt H signal events, and with background events from a data control region with the same selection as the Had region, except that at least one photon has to fail either identification or isolation requirements. This BDT uses the p T , \u03b7, \u03c6, E and the b-tagging decision of up to six leading jets, plus the E miss T information and the same photon observables as used by the BDT in the Lep region. In the Had region, the E miss T information adds discriminating power due to semileptonic top-quark decays with undetected leptons. The data control regions for the Had and Lep BDT training are chosen with the goal to maximise the expected sensitivity, which is affected by the number of events in the training sample and background composition. Events with low values of the BDT response are removed: about 85% (97%) of the tt H signal events are selected and about 89% (43%) of the non-resonant background events are rejected in the Had (Lep) region. The remaining events are categorised into four (three) bins in the Had (Lep) region depending on the value of the BDT response. The number and boundaries of the BDT bins are chosen to optimise the expected sensitivity to the tt H signal. The functional form used to model the continuum background distribution in each BDT bin is chosen using simulated background events for the Lep region and a dedicated data control region for the Had region, following the procedure described in Refs. [1,6]. This procedure imposes stringent conditions on potential biases in the extracted signal yield, in order to avoid losses in sensitivity. No evidence of such a bias is observed within the statistical accuracy of the available control samples. Depending on the BDT bin, either a power-law or an exponential function is chosen, each with one parameter determining the functional shape, and one accounting for the overall background normalisation. The parameters of the continuum background model are left free in the fit. The contributions from the non-tt H production modes are fixed to their SM expectations [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. The predicted ggF, VBF and V H (both qq \u2192 Z H and gg \u2192 Z H) yields are each assigned a conservative 100% uncertainty, which is due to the theoretical uncertainty in the radiation of additional heavy-flavour jets in these Higgs boson production modes. This is supported by measurements using H \u2192 Z Z * \u2192 4 [38], ttbb [39], and V b [40,41] events. The impact of this uncertainty on the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and combined results is small.",

The improvements include new reconstruction algorithms, the relaxed requirements on jets and b-tagged jets, and a BDT-based instead of a cut-based selection for the Lep region. The largest sensitivity improvement (about 30%) is achieved by using four-momentum information of photons, jets and leptons, as well as b-tagging information of jets, as input to the BDT. Both the Had BDT and the Lep BDT use the scaled photon p T /m \u03b3 \u03b3 observable to prevent the diphoton mass being used as a discriminating variable by the BDT. This is further verified using fits of the functional forms chosen in each BDT bin in several additional control regions in data and simulation, and no evidence of a bias is found.

The four-lepton invariant mass is required to be in a window of 115 GeV < m 4 < 130 GeV. To search for tt H events, at least one jet is required, with p T > 30 GeV and containing a b-hadron identified using a b-tagging algorithm with an efficiency of 70%. The event selection is described in more detail in Ref. [5]. The current analysis improves the expected tt H significance by defining two signal regions, and by applying a BDT in one of them. A 'Had' region enriched in hadronic top-quark decays is formed by requiring at least three additional jets and zero additional isolated leptons, and a 'Lep' region enriched in semileptonic top-quark decays is formed by requiring at least one additional jet and at least one additional isolated lepton. The main backgrounds in both regions are ttW , tt Z , and non-tt H Higgs boson production (ggF and t H for the Had and t H for the Lep region), estimated from simulation. The same event generators and cross sections are used as in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis. Uncertainties due to parton distribution functions (PDF) and \u03b1 S , and missing higher-order corrections are considered. To account for the theoretical uncertainty in the radiation of additional heavy-flavour jets, a 100% uncertainty is assigned to the predicted ggF yields. In the Had region, a BDT [53] is employed to separate the tt H signal from the background. Eleven observables are used, including the invariant mass, the dijet p T , and the difference in pseudorapidity \u03b7 of the two leading jets, as well as the difference between the \u03b7 of the four-lepton system and the average \u03b7 of the two leading jets. Further input observables are E miss T , the angular separation R between the four-lepton system and the leading jet, as well as between the dilepton pair with invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass and the leading jet, the scalar sum of the p T of the jets in the event, the number of jets, the number of b-tagged jets, and the value of the leading-order matrix element describing the Higgs boson decay [5]. This matrixelement value will be larger for the leptons from the Higgs boson decay than for those from the tt Z and ttW background. The output discriminant of this BDT is divided into two bins, which are chosen to maximise the expected tt H significance in the Had region. The bin with the higher values of the BDT discriminant and the Lep region are expected to have a tt H signal purity of more than 80%. The other BDT bin is expected to have a tt H signal purity of about 35%.",

All Higgs boson production processes other than tt H, including Higgs boson production in association with a single top quark, are considered as background and their cross sections are fixed to the SM predictions [37]. The respective cross-section uncertainties are considered as systematic uncertainties. The total tt H cross section is extracted assuming SM branching fractions and using the detector acceptance and efficiencies predicted from the tt H simulation  [37], while their uncertainties are not changed. Theoretical uncertainties in the SM cross-section prediction for tt H are included in the signalstrength extraction. The branching-fraction uncertainties and the uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections in the tt H cross-section prediction are correlated between the 7 and 8 TeV and 13 TeV analyses. Furthermore, the relevant uncertainties in the electron/photon energy scale and resolution are correlated. Table 2 shows a summary of the systematic uncertainties in the 13 TeV tt H production cross-section measurement. The dominant uncertainties arise from the modelling of the tt+ heavy-flavour processes in the H \u2192 bb analysis [15] and the modelling of the tt H process, which affects the acceptance of the selection in all Table 3 Measured total tt H production cross sections at 13 TeV, as well as observed (Obs.) and expected (Exp.) significances (sign.) relative to the background-only hypothesis. The results of the individual analyses, as well as the combined results are shown. Since no event is observed in the H \u2192 Z Z * \u2192 4 decay channel, an observed upper limit is set at 68% confidence level on the ttH production cross section in that channel using pseudo-experiments.",

The fake-lepton uncertainty is due to the estimate of leptons from heavy-flavour decay, conversions or misidentified hadronic jets. The jet, electron, and photon uncertainties, as well as the uncertainties associated with hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons, include those in reconstruction and identification efficiencies, as well as in the energy scale and resolution. The Monte Carlo (MC) statistical uncertainty is due to limited numbers of simulated events. More detailed descriptions of the sources of the systematic uncertainties are given in Refs.[10,15].",
