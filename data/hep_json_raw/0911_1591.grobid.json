            "text": "Although vector mesons are produced copiously in e + e \u2212 annihilation, the resonance parameters of them are not well measured [1]. In the ss sector, in a study of initial-state radiation (ISR) events of the type, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the BaBar and Belle Collaborations observed two clear structures near \u221a s = 1.68 GeV and 2.175 GeV, the latter was produced dominantly via a \u03c6f 0 (980) intermediate state, and was dubbed the Y (2175) [2,3]. The \u03c6(1680) was measured by the Belle Collaboration with its mass and width to be 1689 \u00b1 7 \u00b1 10 MeV/c 2 and 211 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 19 MeV/c 2 , respectively [3]. For the Y (2175), its mass and width measured by the BaBar Collaboration are 2175 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 15 MeV/c 2 and 58 \u00b1 16 \u00b1 20 MeV/c 2 , respectively, by fitting the \u03c6f 0 (980) cross section; while with more luminosity, the Belle experiment found that its mass and width are 2163 \u00b1 32 MeV/c 2 and 125\u00b140 MeV/c 2 , respectively. Examining closely the fitting to the \u03c6f 0 (980) cross section, we found that the fitted Y (2175) resonance parameters are sensitive to the background shape. So it is necessary to give a more sophisticated estimation of the resonance parameters of the Y (2175) for a better understanding of its nature. This goal can be reached by performing a combined fit to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) cross sections measured by the BaBar and Belle experiments since all the data are available via Durham database [2,3].",

The Y (2175) was firstly suspected to be an s-quark partner of the Y (4260) [4,5] since both are produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation and exhibit similar decay patterns. On the other hand, a number of different interpretations have been proposed, which include: an ssg hybrid [6]; a 2 3 D 1 ss state [7] with a width predicted to be in the range 120-210 MeV/c 2 ; a tetraquark state [8,9,10]; a \u039b\u039b bound state [11]; a conventional excited \u03c6 meson [12]; or a structure produced by final state interactions [13,14]. The possibility that the Y (2175) is a 3 3 S 1 ss state is disfavored by the rather large predicted width (\u0393 \u223c 380 MeV/c 2 ) [15]. A review [16] discusses the basic problem of the large expected decay widths into two mesons, which are in contrast to experimental observations.",

The fitted values of the \u03c6(1680) and Y (2175) resonance parameters only change a little compared to the two-incoherent-resonance fit, and the difference is quoted as one source of systematic errors. The fit result is shown in Fig. 2 We also fit with two coherent BW functions. Figure 3 shows the fit results. There are two solutions with equally good fit quality, with a goodness-of-the-fit of \u03c7 2 /ndf = 158/110, corresponding to a C.L. of 0.19%. The masses and the widths of the two resonances are identical but the partial widths to e + e \u2212 and relative phases are different in these two solutions, as shown in Table I ",
