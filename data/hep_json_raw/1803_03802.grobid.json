By analyzing the large angle Bhabha scattering events, we measure the integrated luminosity of the data sample at each center-of-mass energy point.

Amplitude analyses of these line-shapes of cross sections will provide crucial information to explore the anomalous line-shape observed by the BESII experiment in 2008 [2].

Most sources are the same as those in the luminosity measurement using Bhabha scattering events, and the corresponding systematic uncertainties are determined with the same approach.

The maximum relative change of the integrated luminosity with respect to the nominal value is taken as the systematic uncertainty.
