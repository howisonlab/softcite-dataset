The theory incorporates the observed masses of the W and Z bosons through a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In the SM, this mechanism relies on the interaction of the gauge bosons with a scalar doublet field and implies the existence of an additional physical state known as the Higgs boson [4][5][6][7]. The existence of the W and Z bosons was first established at the CERN SPS in 1983 [8][9][10][11], and the LHC collaborations ATLAS and CMS reported the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 [12,13]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch At lowest order in the electroweak theory, the W -boson mass, m W , can be expressed solely as a function of the Zboson mass, m Z , the fine-structure constant, \u03b1, and the Fermi constant, G \u03bc . Higher-order corrections introduce an additional dependence of the W -boson mass on the gauge couplings and the masses of the heavy particles of the SM. The mass of the W boson can be expressed in terms of the other SM parameters as follows:",

In the SM, r is in particular sensitive to the top-quark and Higgs-boson masses; in extended theories, r receives contributions from additional particles and interactions. These effects can be probed by comparing the measured and predicted values of m W . In the context of global fits to the SM parameters, constraints on physics beyond the SM are currently limited by the W -boson mass measurement precision [16]. Improving the precision of the measurement of m W is therefore of high importance for testing the overall consistency of the SM. Previous measurements of the mass of the W boson were performed at the CERN SPS proton-antiproton ( pp) collider with the UA1 and UA2 experiments [17,18] at centre-ofmass energies of \u221a s = 546 GeV and \u221a s = 630 GeV, at the Tevatron pp collider with the CDF and D0 detectors at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV [19][20][21] and \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [22][23][24], and at the LEP electron-positron collider by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, and OPAL collaborations at \u221a s = 161-209 GeV [25][26][27][28]. The current Particle Data Group world average value of m W = 80385 \u00b1 15 MeV [29] is dominated by the CDF and D0 measurements performed at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. Given the precisely measured values of \u03b1, G \u03bc and m Z , and taking recent top-quark and Higgs-boson mass measurements, the SM prediction of m W is m W = 80358 \u00b1 8 MeV in Ref. [16] and m W = 80362 \u00b1 8 MeV in Ref. [30]. The SM prediction uncertainty of 8 MeV represents a target for the precision of future measurements of m W .",

In particular, in proton-proton ( pp) collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, approximately 25% of the inclusive W -boson production rate is induced by at least one second-generation quark, s or c, in the initial state. The amount of heavy-quark-initiated production has implications for the W -boson rapidity and transverse-momentum distributions [33]. As a consequence, the measurement of the W -boson mass is sensitive to the strange-quark and charm-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. In contrast, second-generation quarks contribute only to approximately 5% of the overall W -boson production rate at the Tevatron. Other important aspects of the measurement of the W -boson mass are the theoretical description of electroweak corrections, in particular the modelling of photon radiation from the W -and Z -boson decay leptons, and the modelling of the relative fractions of helicity cross sections in the Drell-Yan processes [34].",

For W bosons at rest, the transverse-momentum distributions of the W decay leptons have a Jacobian edge at a value of m/2, whereas the distribution of the transverse mass has an endpoint at the value of m [36], where m is the invariant mass of the charged-lepton and neutrino system, which is related to m W through the Breit-Wigner distribution of Eq. (1). The expected final-state distributions, referred to as templates, are simulated for several values of m W and include signal and background contributions. The templates are compared to the observed distribution by means of a \u03c7 2 com-patibility test. The \u03c7 2 as a function of m W is interpolated, and the measured value is determined by analytical minimisation of the \u03c7 2 function. Predictions for different values of m W are obtained from a single simulated reference sample, by reweighting the W -boson invariant mass distribution according to the Breit-Wigner parameterisation of Eq. (1). The W -boson width is scaled accordingly, following the SM relation W \u221d m 3 W . Experimentally, the p T and p miss T distributions are affected by the lepton energy calibration. The latter is also affected by the calibration of the recoil. The p T and p miss T distributions are broadened by the W -boson transverse-momentum distribution, and are sensitive to the W -boson helicity states, which are influenced by the proton PDFs [37]. Compared to p T , the m T distribution has larger uncertainties due to the recoil, but smaller sensitivity to such physics-modelling effects. Imperfect modelling of these effects can distort the template distributions, and constitutes a significant source of uncertainties for the determination of m W .",

The determination of m Z from the lepton-pair invariant mass provides a first closure test of the lepton energy calibration. In addition, the extraction of m Z from the p T distribution tests the p T -dependence of the efficiency corrections, and the modelling of the Z -boson transverse-momentum distribution and of the relative fractions of Z -boson helicity states. The p miss T and m T variables are defined in Z -boson events by treating one of the reconstructed decay leptons as a neutrino. The extraction of m Z from the m T distribution provides a test of the recoil calibration. The combination of the extraction of m Z from the m , p T and m T distributions provides a closure test of the measurement procedure. The precision of this validation procedure is limited by the finite size of the Z -boson sample, which is approximately ten times smaller than the W -boson sample. The analysis of the Z -boson sample does not probe differences in the modelling of W -and Z -boson production processes. Whereas W -boson production at the Tevatron is charge symmetric and dominated by interactions with at least one valence quark, the sea-quark PDFs play a larger role at the LHC, and contributions from processes with heavy quarks in the initial state have to be modelled properly. The W + -boson production rate exceeds that of W \u2212 bosons by about 40%, with a broader rapidity distribution and a softer transversemomentum distribution. Uncertainties in the modelling of these distributions and in the relative fractions of the Wboson helicity states are constrained using measurements of W -and Z -boson production performed with the ATLAS experiment at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV [41][42][43][44][45]. The final measured value of the W -boson mass is obtained from the combination of various measurements performed in the electron and muon decay channels, and in charge-and |\u03b7 |-dependent categories, as defined in Table 1. The boundaries of the |\u03b7 | categories are driven mainly by experimental and statistical constraints. The measurements of m W used in the combination are based on the observed distributions of p T and m T , which are only partially correlated. Measurements of m W based on the p miss T distributions are performed as consistency tests, but they are not used in the combination due to their significantly lower precision. The consistency of the results in the electron and muon channels provide a further test of the experimental calibrations, whereas the consistency of the results for the different charge and |\u03b7 | categories tests the W -boson production model.",

Quality requirements are applied to the associated tracks in order to reject poorly reconstructed charged-particle trajectories. The energy of the electron is reconstructed from the energy collected in calorimeter cells within an area of size \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.075 \u00d7 0.175 in the barrel, and 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 in the endcaps. A multivariate regression algorithm, developed and optimised on simulated events, is used to calibrate the energy reconstruction. The reconstructed electron energy is corrected to account for the energy deposited in front of the calorimeter and outside the cluster, as well as for variations of the energy response as a function of the impact point of the electron in the calorimeter. The energy calibration algorithm takes as inputs the energy collected by each calorimeter layer, including the presampler, the pseudorapidity of the cluster, and the local position of the shower within the cell of the second layer, which corresponds to the cluster centroid. The kinematic properties of the reconstructed electron are inferred from the energy measured in the EM calorimeter, and from the pseudorapidity and azimuth of the associated track. Electron candidates are required to have p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 and to fulfil a set of tight identification requirements [38]. The pseudorapidity range 1.2 < |\u03b7| < 1.82 is excluded from the measurement, as the amount of passive material in front of the calorimeter and its uncertainty are largest in this region [39], preventing a sufficiently accurate description of non-Gaussian tails in the electron energy response. Additional isolation requirements on the nearby activity in the ID and calorimeter are applied to improve the background rejection. These isolation requirements are implemented by requiring the scalar sum of the p T of tracks in a cone of size R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 0.4 around the electron, p e,cone T , and the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter within a cone of size R < 0.2 around the electron, E cone T , to be small. The contribution from the electron candidate itself is excluded. The specific criteria are optimised as a function of electron \u03b7 and p T to have a combined efficiency of about 95% in the simulation for isolated electrons from the decay of a W or Z boson.",

Complete O(\u03b1) electroweak corrections to the pp \u2192 W + X , W \u2192 \u03bd process were initially calculated in Refs. [75,76]. Combined QCD and EW corrections are however necessary to evaluate the effect of the latter in presence of a realistic p W T distribution. Approximate O(\u03b1 s \u03b1) corrections including parton shower effects are available from Winhac, Sanc [77] and in the Powheg framework [78][79][80]. A complete, fixed-order calculation of O(\u03b1 s \u03b1) corrections in the resonance region appeared in Ref. [81].",

Higher-order corrections give rise to sizeable boson transverse momentum, and to azimuthal asymmetries in the angular distribution of the decay leptons. The angular distribution of the W -and Z -boson decay leptons is determined by the relative fractions of helicity cross sections for the vector-boson production. The fully differential leptonic Drell-Yan cross section can be decomposed as a weighted sum of nine harmonic polynomials, with weights given by the helicity cross sections. The harmonic polyno- mials depend on the polar angle, \u03b8 , and the azimuth, \u03c6, of the lepton in a given rest frame of the boson. The helicity cross sections depend, in their most general expression, on the transverse momentum, p T , rapidity, y, and invariant mass, m, of the boson. It is customary to factorise the unpolarised, or angular-integrated, cross section, d\u03c3/(d p 2 T dy dm), and express the decomposition in terms of dimensionless angular coefficients, A i , which represent the ratios of the helicity cross sections with respect to the unpolarised cross section [34], leading to the following expression for the fully differential Drell-Yan cross section:",

The dependence of the angular coefficients on m is neglected; the effect of this approximation on the measurement of m W is discussed in Sect. 6.4. For the calculation of the predictions, an optimised version of DYNNLO [86] is used, which explicitly decomposes the calculation of the cross section into the different pieces of the q T -subtraction formalism, and allows the computation of statistically correlated PDF variations.

Three QCD parameters were considered in the fit: the intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons, the value of \u03b1 s (m Z ) used for the QCD ISR, and the value of the ISR infrared cut-off. The resulting values of the Pythia 8 parameters constitute the AZ tune. The Pythia 8 AZ prediction was found to provide a satisfactory description of the p Z T distribution as a function of rapidity, contrarily to Powheg+Pythia 8 AZNLO; hence the former is chosen to predict the p W T distribution. The good consistency of the m W measurement results in |\u03b7 | categories, presented in Sect. 11, is also a consequence of this choice.",

Higher-order QCD corrections are expected to be largely correlated between W -boson and Z -boson production induced by the light quarks, u, d, and s, in the initial state. However, a certain degree of decorrelation between W -and Zboson transverse-momentum distributions is expected, due to the different amounts of heavy-quark-initiated production, where heavy refers to charm and bottom flavours. The physical origin of this decorrelation can be ascribed to the presence of independent QCD scales corresponding to the three-tofour flavours and four-to-five flavours matching scales \u03bc c and \u03bc b in the variable-flavour-number scheme PDF evolution [109], which are of the order of the charm-and bottomquark masses, respectively. To assess this effect, the variations of \u03bc F in the QCD ISR are performed simultaneously for all light-quark qq \u2192 W, Z processes, with q = u, d, s, but independently for each of the cc \u2192 Z , bb \u2192 Z , and cq \u2192 W processes, where q = d, s. The effect of the cq \u2192 W variations on the determination of m W is reduced by a factor of two, to account for the presence of only one heavy-flavour quark in the initial state. The resulting uncertainty in m W is 5.0 MeV for the p T distribution, and 6.9 MeV for the m T distribution. Since the \u03bc F variations affect all the branchings of the shower evolution and not only vertices involving heavy quarks, this procedure is expected to yield a sufficient estimate of the \u03bc c,b -induced decorrelation between the W -and Z -boson p T distributions. Treating the \u03bc F variations as correlated between all quark flavours, but uncorrelated between W -and Z -boson production, would yield a systematic uncertainty in m W of approximately 30 MeV.",

In addition, the p T and m T distributions are broadened by the electron-energy and muonmomentum resolutions. Finally, the lepton-selection efficiencies depend on the lepton pseudorapidity and transverse momentum, further modifying these distributions. Corrections to the detector response are derived from the data, and presented below. In most cases, the corrections are applied to the simulation, with the exception of the muon sagitta bias corrections and electron energy response corrections, which are applied to the data. Backgrounds to the selected Z \u2192 samples are taken into account using the same procedures as discussed in Sect. 9. Since the Z samples are used separately for momentum calibration and efficiency measurements, as well as for the recoil response corrections discussed in Sect. 8, correlations among the corresponding uncertainties can appear. These correlations were investigated and found to be negligible.",

The uncertainty due to the choice of fitting range is estimated by varying the range by \u00b1 10%, and repeating the procedure. The uncertainty due to the fit methodology is estimated by comparing the template fit results with an alternative approach, based on an iterative \u03c7 2 minimisation.

The corresponding systematic uncertainty in m W is defined assuming, in each bin of |\u03b7|, a momentum non-linearity given by the larger of the fitted value of p 1 and its uncertainty. This source of uncertainty is considered uncorrelated across muon pseudorapidity given that p 1 is dominated by statistical fluctuations. The effect of the imperfect knowledge of the material in the ID is studied using simulated event samples including an increase of the ID material by 10%, according to the uncertainty estimated in Ref. [114]. The impact of this variation is found to be negligible in comparison with the uncertainties discussed above. Two methods are used for the determination of the sagitta bias \u03b4. The first method exploits Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events. Muons are categorised according to their charge and pseudorapidity, and for each of these categories, the position of the peak in the dimuon invariant mass distribution is determined for data and simulation. The procedure allows the determination of the charge dependence of the momentum scale for p T values of approximately 42 GeV, which corresponds to the average transverse momentum of muons from Z -boson decays. The second method exploits identified electrons in a sample of W \u2192 e\u03bd decays. It is based on the ratio of the measured electron energy deposited in the calorimeter, E, to the electron momentum, p, measured in the ID. A clean sample of W \u2192 e\u03bd events with tightly identified electrons [38] is selected. Assuming that the response of the electromagnetic calorimeter is independent of the charge of the incoming particle, charge-dependent ID track momentum biases are extracted from the average differences in E/ p for electrons and positrons [113]. This method benefits from a larger event sample compared to the first method, and allows the determination of charge-dependent corrections for p T values of approximately 38 GeV, which corresponds to the average transverse momentum of muons in W -boson decays. The sagitta bias correction factors are derived using both methods separately in 40 \u03b7 bins and 40 \u03c6 bins. The results are found to agree within uncertainties and are combined, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. The combined correction uncertainty is dominated by the finite size of the event samples. Figure 6 shows the dimuon invariant mass distribution of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays in data and simulation, after applying all corrections. Table 4 summarises the effect of the muon momentum scale and resolution uncertainties on the determination of m W . The dominant systematic uncertainty in the momentum scale is due to the extrapolation of the correction from the Z -boson momentum range to the W -boson momentum range. The extrapolation uncertainty \u03b4\u03b1 is (2-5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 for |\u03b7 | < 2.0, and (4-7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 for |\u03b7 | > 2.0. Systematic uncertainties from other sources are relatively small. The systematic uncertainty of the resolution corrections is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the Z -boson event sample, and includes a contribution from the imperfect closure of the method. The latter is defined from the residual difference between the standard deviations of the dimuon invariant mass in data and simulation, after applying resolution corrections.  The selection of muon candidates in W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events requires an isolated track reconstructed in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer. In addition, the events are required to pass the muon trigger selection. Differences in the efficiency of the reconstruction and selection requirements between data and simulation can introduce a systematic shift in the measurement of the W -boson mass, and have to be corrected. In particular, the extraction of m W is sensitive to the dependence of the trigger, reconstruction and isolation efficiencies on the muon p T and on the projection of the recoil on the lepton transverse momentum, u . For muons with p T larger than approximately 15 GeV the detector simulation predicts constant efficiency as a function of p T , both for the muon trigger selection and the track reconstruction. In contrast, the efficiency of the isolation requirement is expected to vary as a function of p T and u . The efficiency corrections also affect the muon selection inefficiency, and hence the estimation of the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc background, which contributes to the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd selection when one of the decay muons fails the muon reconstruction or kinematic selection requirements.",

The average number of interactions per bunch crossing is defined, for each event, as \u03bc = L\u03c3 in / f BC , where L is the instantaneous luminosity, \u03c3 in is the total pp inelastic cross section and f BC is the average bunch-crossing rate. The distribution of \u03bc in the simulated event samples is reweighted to match the corresponding distribution in data. The distribution of \u03bc is affected in particular by the uncertainty in the cross section and properties of inelastic collisions.

The procedure described above is used to correct the recoil response from Powheg+Pythia 8 to Powheg+Herwig 6, where the latter is treated as pseudodata. As shown in Fig. 13, the corrected W recoil distributions in Powheg+Pythia 8 match the corresponding distributions in Powheg+Herwig 6. For this study, the effect of the different particle-level p W T distributions in both samples is removed by reweighting the Powheg+Pythia 8 prediction to Powheg+Herwig 6. This study is performed applying the standard lepton selection cuts, but avoiding further kinematic selections in order to maximize the statistics available for the test.",

In the muon channel, the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc background represents 4.8 and 6.3% of the W + \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd and W \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd samples, respectively. The W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd background represents 1.0% of the selected sample in both channels, and the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 background contributes approximately 0.12%. The normalisation of these processes relative to the W -boson signal and the corresponding uncertainties are discussed in Sect. 4. A relative uncertainty of 0.2% is assigned to the normalisation of the W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd samples with respect to the W -boson signal sample, to account for the uncertainty in the \u03c4 -lepton branching fractions to electrons and muons. In the determination of the W -boson mass, the variations of m W are propagated to the W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd background templates in the same way as for the signal.",

In each category, the value of m W is determined by a \u03c7 2 minimisation, comparing the p T and m T distributions in data and simulation for different values of m W . The templates are generated with values of m W in steps of 1 to 10 MeV within a range of \u00b1 400 MeV, centred around the reference value used in the Monte Carlo signal samples. The statistical uncertainty is estimated from the half width of the \u03c7 2 function at the value corresponding to one unit above the minimum. Systematic uncertainties due to physics-modelling corrections, detector-calibration corrections, and background subtraction, are discussed in Sects. 6-8 and 10, respectively.",

Leptoncalibration uncertainties are the dominant sources of experimental systematic uncertainty for the extraction of m W from the p T distribution. These uncertainties vary from about 15 MeV to about 35 MeV for most measurement categories, except the highest |\u03b7| bin in the muon channel where the total uncertainty of about 120 MeV is dominated by the muon momentum linearity uncertainty. The uncertainty in the calibration of the recoil is the largest source of experimental systematic uncertainty for the m T distribution, with a typical contribution of about 15 MeV for all categories. The determination of m W from the p T and m T distributions in the various categories is summarised in Table 10, including an overview of statistical and systematic uncertainties.

The value of m W used in the predictions is set to the overall measurement result presented in the next section. The \u03c7 2 values quantifying the comparison between data and prediction are calculated over the full histogram range and account for all sources of uncertainty. The bin-to-bin correlations induced by the experimental and physics-modelling systematic uncertainties are also accounted for. Overall, satisfactory agreement is observed. The deficit of data visible for p T \u223c 40-42 GeV in the W + \u2192 e\u03bd channel does not strongly affect the mass measurement, as the observed effect differs from that expected from m W variations. Cross-checks of possible sources of this effect were performed, and its impact on the mass determination was shown to be within the corresponding systematic uncertainties.",

Muonmomentum and electron-energy calibration uncertainties are uncorrelated between the different decay channels, but largely correlated between the p T and m T distributions. Recoil-calibration uncertainties are correlated between electron and muon decay channels, and they are small for p T distributions. The PDF-induced uncertainties are largely cor-  T distribution. Inconsistencies between the electron and muon channels could indicate problems in the calibration of the muon-momentum and electron-energy responses. Significant differences between results from the p T and m T distributions would point to either problems in the calibration of the recoil, or to an incorrect modelling of the transverse-momentum distribution of the W boson. Several measurement combinations are performed, using the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) method [119,120]. The results of the combinations are verified with the HERAverager program [121], which gives very close results. Table 11 shows an overview of partial m W measurement combinations. In the first step, determinations of m W in the electron and muon decay channels from the m T distribution are combined separately for the positive-and negativecharge categories, and together for both W -boson charges. The results are compatible, and the positively charged, negatively charged, and charge-inclusive combinations yield values of \u03c7 2 /dof corresponding to 2/6, 7/6, and 11/13, respec-tively. Compatibility of the results is also observed for the corresponding combinations from the p T distribution, with values of \u03c7 2 /dof of 5/6, 10/6, and 19/13, for positively charged, negatively charged, and charge-inclusive combinations, respectively. The \u03c7 2 compatibility test validates the consistency of the results in the W \u2192 e\u03bd and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay channels. The precision of the determination of m W from the m T distribution is slightly worse than the result obtained from the p T distribution, due to the larger uncertainty induced by the recoil calibration. In addition, the impact of PDF-and p W T -related uncertainties on the p T fits is limited by the optimisation of the fitting range. In the second step, determinations of m W from the p T and m T distributions are combined separately for the electron and the muon decay channels. The results are compatible, with values of \u03c7 2 /dof of 4/5 and 8/5 in the electron channel for the p T and m T distributions, respectively, and values of 7/7 and 3/7 in the muon channel for the p T and m T distributions, respectively. The m W determinations in the electron and in the muon channels agree, further validating the consistency of the electron and muon calibrations. Agreement between the m W determinations from the p T and m T distributions supports the calibration of the recoil, and the modelling of the transverse momentum of the W boson.",

The measurement is based on protonproton collision data recorded in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV at the LHC, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 . The measurement relies on a thorough detector calibration based on the study of Zboson events, leading to a precise modelling of the detector response to electrons, muons and the recoil. Templates for the W -boson kinematic distributions are obtained from the NLO MC generator Powheg, interfaced to Pythia8 for the parton shower. The signal samples are supplemented with several additional physics-modelling corrections allowing for the inclusion of higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections, and by fits to measured distributions, so that agreement between the data and the model in the kinematic distributions is improved. The W -boson mass is obtained from the transverse-momentum distribution of charged leptons and from the transverse-mass distributions, for positively and negatively charged W bosons, in the electron and muon decay channels, and in several kinematic categories. The individual measurements of m W are found to be consistent and their combination yields a value of m W = 80370 \u00b1 7 (stat.) \u00b1 11 (exp. syst.) \u00b1 14 (mod. syst.) MeV",

An overview of the different m W measurements is shown in Fig. 28. The compatibility of the measured value of m W in the context of the global electroweak fit is illustrated in Figs. 29 and 30. Figure 29 compares the present mea-surement with earlier results, and with the SM prediction updated with regard to Ref. [16] using recent measurements of the top-quark and Higgs boson masses, m t = 172.84 \u00b1 0.70 GeV [122] and m H = 125.09 \u00b1 0.24 GeV [123]. This update gives a numerical value for the SM prediction of m W = 80356 \u00b1 8 MeV. The corresponding two-dimensional 68 and 95% confidence limits for m W and m t are shown in Fig. 30, and compared to the present measurement of m W and the average of the top-quark mass determinations performed by ATLAS [122].",

            "text": "The determination of the W -boson mass from the global fit of the electroweak parameters has an uncertainty of 8 MeV, which sets a natural target for the precision of the experimental measurement of the mass of the W boson. The modelling uncertainties, which currently dominate the overall uncertainty of the m W measurement presented in this paper, need to be reduced in order to fully exploit the larger data samples available at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV. Better knowledge of the PDFs, as achievable with the inclusion in PDF fits of recent precise measurements of W -and Z -boson rapidity cross sections with the ATLAS detector [41], and improved QCD and electroweak predictions for Drell-Yan production, are therefore crucial for future measurements of the W -boson mass at the LHC. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
