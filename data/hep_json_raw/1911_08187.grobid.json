            "text": "Studies of semileptonic B meson decays have recently generated interest due to a number of anomalies in experimental results. Measurements of the observables R(D) and R(D * ) [1][2][3][4][5][6] have shown hints of lepton non-universality with a combined significance of over 3 \u03c3 [7]. To probe the flavour structure of possible new physics contributions to these decay modes, it is desirable to make analogous measurements for decays involving different quark-level processes, such as b \u2192 u transitions. To that end, the decay mode B + \u2192 pp + \u03bd is promising experimentally, particularly when performing the measurement at a hadron collider. The requirement of a proton anti-proton pair in the final state should significantly reduce combinatorial background, which would otherwise be significant for final states with pions.",

            "text": "Semileptonic decays of B mesons to a final state containing multiple baryons are as yet unobserved. A theoretical model of B + \u2192 pp + \u03bd decays has been constructed with perturbative QCD (pQCD) [8]. This model is based on studies of several fully hadronic B \u2192 Y Y X decays where Y and Y represent baryons and X one or more mesons. By fitting the angular distributions and decay rates of the hadronic modes the authors of refs. [8][9][10] estimate the differential rate of B + \u2192 pp + \u03bd decays. They also predict the total branching fraction of the B + \u2192 pp + \u03bd decay to be (1.04 \u00b1 0.38) \u00d7 10 \u22124 for l = \u00b5, e leptons. This prediction motivated a search by the Belle collaboration for this channel that lead to evidence for the B + \u2192 ppe + \u03bd e decay mode with 3.0 \u03c3 significance [11]. The branching fraction was measured to be (8.2 +3.7 \u22123.2 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , one order of magnitude smaller than the prediction.",

It is surprising that the branching fractions of decays of B mesons to final states comprising only two baryons are suppressed compared to those of two baryons and one or more extra final state particles [12]. For example, the branching fraction of B 0 \u2192 pp is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the similar B 0 \u2192 pp\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay [12,13]. Furthermore, the invariant-mass distributions of the baryon pair in B \u2192 Y Y X decays show a characteristic accumulation at low values, called the threshold enhancement effect [14][15][16][17]. Measurements of B + \u2192 pp + \u03bd semileptonic decays provide the ideal environment for understanding the Y\u0232 |(q b) V \u2212A |B matrix element that contributes to hadronic decay modes.",

Once a signal candidate has been constructed, the other tracks in the event close to the B decay vertex are examined. A BDT is used to identify those nearby tracks that can be associated with the signal candidate decay vertex. If the candidate is truly signal, there should be few other tracks that can be associated with it and the BDT should classify them with a low score. On the other hand, the extra track(s) from a partially reconstructed decay returns a high score if such tracks are found. The isolation algorithm returns the BDT output for the four tracks most likely to have come from the B vertex. These four numbers are themselves combined into a single BDT classifier, known as the charged-isolation BDT. This BDT is trained on simulation to discriminate signal from B + \u2192 \u039b \u2212 c p\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays, which is expected to be the largest mode with extra charged tracks. The efficacy of this BDT in reducing such background is shown in figure 1(a). The indicated requirement on the charged BDT score rejects 80% of the major background decay B \u2192 \u039b \u2212 c p\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 X (with all possible decay modes of the \u039b \u2212 c considered), whilst retaining 93% of the signal. For those partially reconstructed final states with only additional neutral particles, further suppression is achieved by considering the kinematics of the decays. An additional BDT, the so called part-reco BDT, considers 11 variables: the impact parameter significance of the three final-state tracks, the pp pair and the B + candidate with respect to the JHEP03(2020)146 PV; the impact parameters of the tracks with respect to the fitted B + decay vertex; the \u03c7 2 of the B + vertex fit; the angle between the B + candidate momentum and displacement vectors; and the difference between the p and p momenta. The part-reco BDT is trained on simulation in order to discriminate signal from a mixture of all the considered background modes. The result of this training is shown in figure 1(b). The selection on the part-reco BDT output removes 18% of the decays B \u2192 ppD and keeps 98% of the signal.",

The parameters of the BDT weighter used to correct these distributions are altered and the relative efficiencies recalculated, with the difference to the nominal relative efficiency being the assigned uncertainty.

New sets of weights for the simulation are created that sample extreme variations of the model parameters (\u00b15 \u03c3), and for each variation the efficiency is recalculated.

For those components that rely on kernel density estimators, a systematic uncertainty is assessed for the choice of smoothing parameter by varying it. The uncertainty due to the choice of model for the signal shape is found by replacing the nominal PDF with one constructed with kernel density estimators. The uncertainty due to the limited sizes of the simulation samples is determined by generating new simulation from the nominal fit PDFs with the same sample sizes and making alternative PDFs with those samples.

Combining these with the efficiency ratios from section 5, the differential branching fraction in each m(pp) bin is calculated. The results are presented in table 3. The relative differential branching fractions are summed over the bins, with the correlation of the systematic uncertainties between the bins accounted for, to give the total relative branching fraction of",
