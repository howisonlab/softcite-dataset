Because the leading-order decay rate of t \u2192 Wb is also quite large, the SM branching fraction B (t \u2192 Hq), where q is an up or charm quark, is predicted to be of O (10 \u221215 )  [6][7][8], far below the experimental sensitivity at the LHC. However, some extensions of the SM predict an enhanced t \u2192 Hq decay rate. Thus, observation of a large branching fraction would be clear evidence for new physics. The largest enhancement in B(t \u2192 Hq) is predicted in models that incorporate a two-Higgs doublet, where the branching fraction can be of O(10 \u22123 ) [8].",

This channel is sensitive to the Higgs boson decaying into WW, ZZ, or \u03c4 \u03c4 which have branching fractions of 21.5%, 2.6%, and 6.3%, respectively [12]. The diphoton analysis considers events with two photons, a bottom quark, and a W boson that decays either hadronically or leptonically. The two photons in this channel are used to reconstruct the Higgs boson which decays to diphotons with B (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = 0.23% [12]. Finally, events with at least four jets, three of which result from the hadronization of bottom quarks (b jets), and a leptonically decaying W boson are considered. The b jet + lepton channel takes advantage of the large Higgs boson branching fraction into bb pairs, B(H \u2192 bb) = 57% [13]. A summary of the enumerated final states is shown in table 1.",

Within the field volume there are several particle detection systems. Charged particle trajectories are measured by silicon pixel and strip trackers, covering 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the tracking volume. It is comprised of a barrel region |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| = 3. A brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) surrounds the ECAL and also covers the region |\u03b7| < 3. The forward hadron calorimeter (HF) uses steel as the absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. The HF extends the calorimeter coverage to the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2. A lead and silicon-strip preshower detector is located in front of the ECAL endcaps. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing momentum balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction.",

Prompt electrons and muons arising from W and Z decays are typically more isolated than nonprompt leptons arising from the decay of hadrons within jets. In order to distinguish between prompt and nonprompt lepton candidates, a relative isolation parameter is defined for each lepton candidate. This is calculated by summing the p T of all charged and neutral particles reconstructed using the particle-flow algorithm within a cone of angular radius \u2206R \u2261 \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the lepton candidate momentum, where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle (in radians) differences, respectively, between the directions of the lepton and the other particle [18,19]. This cone excludes the lepton candidate and the charged particles associated with the pileup vertices. The resulting quantity is corrected for additional underlying-event activity owing to neutral particles [3], and then divided by the lepton candidate's p T . The relative isolation parameter is required to be less than 0.15 for electrons and 0.12 for muons.",

The ECAL signals are calibrated [22], and a multivariate regression, developed for a previous H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 analysis [23], is used to estimate the energy of the photon. Clusters are formed from the neighboring ECAL crystals seeded around local maxima of energy deposits, and the collection of clusters that contain the energy of a photon or an electron is called a supercluster. Identification criteria are applied to distinguish photons from jets and electrons. The observables used in the photon identification criteria are the isolation variables, the ratio of the energy in the HCAL towers behind the supercluster to the electromagnetic energy in the supercluster, the transverse width in \u03b7 of the electromagnetic shower, and JHEP02 (2017)079the number of charged tracks matched to the supercluster. The photon efficiency identification is measured using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events in data by reconstructing the electron showers as photons [24], taking into account the shower shape and whether the electron probe is located in the barrel or endcap. The two highest p T photons must exceed 33 and 25 GeV,respectively. Jets are reconstructed from the candidates produced by the particle-flow algorithm. An anti-k T clustering algorithm [25] with a distance parameter of 0.5 is used for jet reconstruction. Jets with a significant fraction of energy coming from pileup interactions or not associated with the primary vertex are rejected. Remaining pileup energy in jets is subtracted using a technique that relies on information about the jet area [26][27][28]. Reconstructed jets are calibrated to take into account differences in detector response [29]. The jets in the multilepton and b jet + lepton selections are required to have p T > 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and to be separated from leptons such that \u2206R(lepton, jet) > 0.3. The selection of jets in the diphoton events differs by requiring the jet E T > 20 GeV and the jets be separated from both photons such that \u2206R(photon, jet) > 0.3.",

The differences between the nonprompt misidentification rates in the two measurement regions and the signal region are then used to estimate the systematic uncertainty of this background. To further assess the systematic uncertainty, the misidentification rates are also measured in simulated events that reproduce the background composition of events in the signal region and compared to the rates measured from data.",

As in the analysis of the inclusive SM Higgs boson decaying into diphotons [50], the signal shape of the diphoton invariant mass distribution is described by the sum of three Gaussian functions. Although the contribution from the SM Higgs boson background, dominated by the ttH process, is relatively small in comparison to the contribution of the nonresonant diphoton background, the resonant diphoton background cannot be ignored because it has a very similar m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution as the signal. A pull is then defined as (N fit \u2212 N gen )/\u03c3 N fit , where N fit is the fitted number of signal events in the pseudo-experiments, N gen is the number of generated signal events, and \u03c3 N fit is the corresponding uncertainty. In the case under consideration, N gen = 0. The procedure is verified by injecting signal in the pseudo-experiments. Several models are tried, and the chosen function for nonresonant diphoton background is the one whose bias (offset of the pull distribution) is less than 0.15 and with the minimum number of degrees of freedom for the entire set of tested models. A third-order Bernstein polynomial is selected as the functional form of the background for both the hadronic and leptonic channels. After determining the function to describe the nonresonant diphoton background, a function given by the sum of probability density functions of the resonant and nonresonant diphoton backgrounds and signal is fitted to the data. The normalization of the resonant diphoton background is allowed to vary within its uncertainties, while the normalization of the nonresonant component is unconstrained. Table 4 gives a summary of the observed and expected event yields for the two diphoton channels and figure 4 shows the fit result overlaid with the data.",

The topologies pp \u2192 tt \u2192 Hq + Wb events, where q = u, c and H is allowed to decay into WW, ZZ, \u03c4 \u03c4 , \u03b3\u03b3, and bb. No excess of events above the SM background is observed, and branching fractions of B(t \u2192 Hc) larger than 0.40% and B(t \u2192 Hu) larger than 0.55% are excluded at the 95% confidence level. These observed upper limits on B(t \u2192 Hq) and the corresponding constraints on the top quark flavor-changing Higgs boson Yukawa couplings are amongst the most stringent measured to date. ",
