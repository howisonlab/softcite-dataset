(charge-conjugate), as well as improved measurements for the \u03c7cJ hyperon decays \u03c7cJ \u2192pK + \u039b + c.c.. The branching fractions are measured to be B(\u03c8 \u2192pK + \u03a3 0 + c.c) = (1.67\u00b10.13\u00b10.12)\u00d710 \u22125 , B(\u03c7c0 \u2192pK + \u039b+c.c.) = (13.2\u00b10.3\u00b11.0)\u00d710 \u22124 , B(\u03c7c1 \u2192pK + \u039b+c.c.) = (4.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03c7c2 \u2192pK + \u039b + c.c) = (8.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , where the first error is statistical, and the second is systematic. In the decay of \u03c7c0 \u2192pK + \u039b + c.c., an anomalous enhancement near threshold is observed in the invariant mass distribution ofp\u039b + c.c., which cannot be explained by phase space.",

            "text": "The study of hadronic decays of the cc states J/\u03c8, \u03c8 , and \u03c7 cJ could provide valuable information on perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the charmonium-mass regime and on the structure of charmonia. The color-octet mechanism (COM), which successfully described several decay patterns of the P-wave \u03c7 cJ states [1], may be applicable to other \u03c7 cJ decays. Measurements of \u03c7 cJ hadronic decays may provide new input into COM and further assist in understanding the mechanisms of \u03c7 cJ decays. Hadronic decays of charmonia below the DD mass threshold are also a good place to search for previously unknown meson states [2]. The BES Collaboration has previously reported observations of near-threshold structures in baryon-antibaryon invariant-mass distributions in the radiative decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp [3] and the purely hadronic decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 p\u039bK \u2212 \u2020 [4]. It has been suggested theoretically that these states may be observations of baryonium [5], or caused by final state interactions [6]. Studying the same decay modes in other charmonia may provide complementary information to improve the knowledge on these unexpected enhancements. It is also interesting to search for potential structures formed by \u039b\u039b and p\u03a3 pairs, which could assist in extending the theoretical models.",

The BESIII [7] detector has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 and has four main components: (1) A small-cell, helium-based (40% He, 60% C 3 H 8 ) main drift chamber (MDC) with 43 layers providing an average single-hit resolution of 135 \u00b5m, and charged-particle momentum resolution in a 1 T magnetic field of 0.5% at 1 GeV/c. (2) An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consisting of 6240 CsI(Tl) crystals in the cylindrical structure barrel and two endcaps. The energy resolution at 1.0 GeV is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (endcaps), while the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) in the barrel (endcaps). (3) Particle Identification (PID) is provided by a time-of-flight system (TOF) constructed of 5-cm-thick plastic scintillators, with 176 detectors of 2.4 m length in two layers in the barrel and 96 fan-shaped detectors in the endcaps. The barrel (endcap) time resolution of 80 ps (110 ps) provides 2\u03c3 K/\u03c0 separation for momenta up to \u223c 1.0 GeV/c. (4) The muon system (MUC) consists of 1000 m 2 of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in nine barrel and eight endcap layers and provides 2 cm position resolution.",

Charmonium resonances, such as J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 , are generated by KKMC [9,10], which accounts for the effects of initial-state radiation and beam energy spread.

The branching fractions are listed in Table III. For thepK + \u039b + c.c. final state in the decays of \u03c7 c0 , an anomalous enhancement is observed in the invariantmass distribution ofp\u039b + c.c., which could correspond to the structure observed in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 p\u039bK \u2212 [4]. It is of great interest that the structure is located very close to the mass threshold ofp\u039b + c.c., and this may be accounted for as a quasibound dibaryon state or as an enhancement due to a final-state interaction, or simply as an interference effect of high-mass N * and \u039b * . Our new measurements may aid in the theory of charmonia decays, and also be a guide in the calculation of decay modes into strangeness dibaryon systems. A detail study on the near-threshold structure is expected with larger statistics in future BESIII running.  ",
