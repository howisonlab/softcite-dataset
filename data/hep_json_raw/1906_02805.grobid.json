            "text": "Many models of physics beyond the standard model (BSM) predict enhanced or modified couplings of top quarks to other particles. This is particularly relevant for processes that have small production cross sections and, therefore, are yet to be observed, such as the production of four top quarks, tttt. There is considerable interest in the measurement of the tttt cross section because of its sensitivity to BSM physics, including supersymmetry [1,2], composite models [3], top quark compositeness [4], two-Higgs-doublet models [5][6][7], and models with extra spatial dimensions [8,9]. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, the contribution of any BSM process to tttt production can be parameterized in terms of nonrenormalizable effective couplings of the standard model (SM) fields, if the characteristic energy scale, \u039b, of the BSM physics is much larger than the typical energy scale of tttt production at the LHC. A generic interpretation of the tttt production can be done using the EFT predictions [10].",

To facilitate comparison with published ATLAS and CMS analyses using comparable data sets, the NLO quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation with a value -1 -JHEP11(2019)082 of \u03c3 SM tt tt = 9.2 fb is used [12,13].

The CMS Collaboration measured the tttt production cross section in a search exploiting samesign dilepton and multilepton signatures [21,22] using 13 TeV data (35.9 fb \u22121 ) collected in 2016. The ATLAS Collaboration investigated anomalous tttt production in events with Lorentz-boosted top quarks identified with top quark tagging techniques [23] using 13 TeV data (36.1 fb \u22121 ) collected in 2015-2016. This paper presents a new search in the single-lepton (SL) (\u00b5, e)+jets and oppositesign dilepton (DL) (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 , or e + e \u2212 )+jets tttt decay channels using pp collisions at 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb \u22121 . For this analysis, only final states containing one or two leptons are considered, which constitute about 40% of all tttt decays. Compared to the previous analysis [20], we have implemented a number of important changes which combine to give a much improved analysis sensitivity. The training process and selection of the input variables for the event-discriminating MVA's (section 4.2) in both the SL and OS dilepton channels has been re-optimized. A new categorization of the signal sensitive regions at large jet and b-tag multiplicities has been introduced, and a revised binning scheme is used to decrease the statistical uncertainties, and improve the signal sensitivity. The categorisation provides additional discrimination against the rare tt+boson (H, Z, W, WW/WZ/ZZ) backgrounds. Lastly, a much larger simulated tt data set is used to populate the discriminant bins with high jet multiplicity and high b-tag multiplicity.",

The powheg-box simulations are interfaced with pythia 8.212 using the CUETP8M2T4 tune [39][40][41].

To allow for this, a parton-level reweighting of the tt simulation has been applied to match the predictions to the data [42,43]. The correction is applied as a function of the transverse momenta of the parton-level top quark and antiquark after initial-and final-state radiation.

Single-lepton events are required to have exactly one isolated muon with p T > 26 GeV or one isolated electron with p T > 35 GeV, either within |\u03b7| < 2.1. In the dilepton channel, events are required to contain exactly two isolated leptons of opposite sign with p T > 25 GeV for the leading and p T > 20 GeV for the subleading lepton, within |\u03b7| < 2.4. Muons must satisfy the criteria described in ref. [58] and have a relative isolation, I rel < 0.15. Electron candidates must satisfy stringent identification criteria, including I rel , which are described in ref. [59]. The I rel is defined as the scalar p T sum of the additional particles consistent with the same vertex as the lepton, within a cone of angular radius \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the lepton, divided by the p T of the lepton, where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 (in radians) are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, respectively, between the directions of the lepton and the additional particle. The sum is corrected for the neutral particle contribution from pileup on an event-by-event basis [58,59]. To suppress background events from decays of low-mass resonances and Z bosons, the lepton pairs are required to have an invariant mass greater than 20 GeV and be outside of a 30 GeV window centered on the Z boson mass in both the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 channels.

Jets are reconstructed from the PF candidates using the infrared-and collinear-safe anti-k T algorithm [60,61] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Pileup interactions can contribute tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, charged particles identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded and the jet is corrected for the remaining contributions [62,63]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulations to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale between real and simulated data [64].

The difference in the jet multiplicity is motivated by the need to reduce the residual contamination from multijet QCD background in the electron channel due to a higher lepton misidentification rate. In the selected events, at least two jets must be tagged as originating from the hadronization of bottom quarks (b jets) using the combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) algorithm at its medium working point [66]. Additional b jet candidates are identified using the CSVv2 algorithm at its loose working point. The two working points, loose and medium, provide different levels of purity and efficiency. The loose working point gives a misidentification rate of approximately 10% for light-quark and gluon jets, with a b tagging efficiency of about 80%. The medium working point has a misidentification rate of about 1% with a b tagging efficiency of about 68%. The efficiency to tag c quarks is 12%. To suppress the small residual QCD background, p miss T is required to be larger than 50 GeV. Studies on the estimation of non-prompt leptons from QCD multijet background by inverting lepton isolation selection criteria have verified that this background is negligible after applying the selection requirements. In addition, a requirement on the scalar sum of the p T of all jets, H T > 500 GeV, is applied. The H T requirement is used to suppress the tt background, while having little effect on the signal acceptance [20].",

The energy scale, \u039b, is the scale below which on-shell effects of BSM physics can be neglected and is typically related to the mass scale of the hypothetical BSM states. The EFT approach is generic and, in principle, experimental constraints obtained within the EFT framework can be recast into bounds on parameters of any ultraviolet-complete new physics model.

Dots represent data. Vertical error bars show the statistical uncertainties in data. The post-fit background predictions are shown as shaded histograms. Open boxes demonstrate the size of the pre-fit uncertainty in the total background and are centered around the pre-fit expectation value of the prediction. The hatched area shows the size of the post-fit uncertainty in the background prediction. The signal histogram template is shown as a solid line. The lower panel shows the relative difference of the observed number of events over the post-fit background prediction.",
