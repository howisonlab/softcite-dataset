The narrow X(3872) [1], and various vector mesons, in particular, the broad Y (4260) [2][3][4] resonance, were revealed by their dipion transitions to J/\u03c8 (and \u03c8 \u2032 ). By analogy with the Y (4260) discovery, it was suggested that a hidden-beauty counterpart, denoted Y b [5], could be sought in radiative return events from e + e \u2212 at center-of-mass energy on the \u03a5(10860) peak, or by an energy scan above it.",

The energy-dependent cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events are measured for the first time, and are found to differ from the shape of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb cross section. A Breit-Wigner resonance shape fit yields a peak mass of 10888.4 +2.7 \u22122.6 (stat) \u00b1 1.2 (syst) MeV/c 2 and a width of 30.7 +8.3 \u22127.0 (stat) \u00b1 3.1 (syst) MeV/c 2 . A fit excluding the \u221a s \u223c 11.02 GeV data point is consistent with the nominal fit, indicating no strong contribution of \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events from \u03a5(11020). The \u03a5(10860) shape parameters obtained from our R b hadronic cross section mea-surements are consistent with the measurements from BaBar.

The \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 partial widths were found to be much larger than the expectations for conventional \u03a5(5S) states. As an extension, energy-dependent \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production cross sections are measured; the observed structure deviates slightly from the \u03a5(10860) shape obtained from the hadronic cross sections.
