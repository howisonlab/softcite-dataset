This \u03bd s neutrino would not have a Standard Model charged lepton partner, so it could not couple to the W boson. Further, LEP measurements of the invisible decay of the Z 0 boson [14] are consistent with three neutrino flavors implying that any additional neutrino state \u03bd s is either very massive or it is sterile and does not participate in the weak interaction [15]. Identical arguments can be applied to scenarios with two or more \u03bd s states. The discovery of a new sterile neutrino state with a mass below half the Z 0 boson mass could help explain the smallness of neutrino masses [16]. In addition, \u03bd s 's are also dark matter candidates, as they may have a wide range of masses and have no mechanism to directly decay into lighter particles over timescales comparable to the age of the Universe due to their absence of non-gravitational interactions with matter [15]. Furthermore, \u03bd s 's may explain puzzling questions related to the fusion reaction rate during core-collapse supernovae [15]. Data from the short- * Deceased.",

            "text": "baseline experiments LSND and MiniBooNE [17,18] are compatible with active-sterile neutrino oscillations driven by a new \u2206m 2 of the order of 1 eV 2 , but this evidence is inconclusive [19,20]. A deficit of \u03bd e consistent with the same \u2206m 2 range has been observed in measurements with calibration sources used by the SAGE and GALLEX gallium experiments [21,22]. Several other short-baseline and long-baseline searches have found no evidence for these light \u03bd s states and place strong constraints on their existence [23][24][25][26][27]. Meanwhile, calculations of reactor\u03bd e fluxes [28,29] predict a value 3% larger on average larger on average than experiments have observed, which has been interpreted as\u03bd e disappearance; but recent measurements of the reactor core fuel evolution [30], and observation of spectral distortions independent of distance to reactor cores [31], disfavor this interpretation. The NOvA experiment can search for oscillations into \u03bd s 's by looking for disappearance of the active neutrino flux between the Near Detector (ND) and Far Detector (FD). In the analysis presented here, we focus on the neutral-current (NC) channel. Oscillations into a fourth light \u03bd s state would result in an energy-dependent suppression of the NC event rate, as the \u03bd s would not interact in the detector. This suppression contrasts with the effects of standard oscillations among the three active neutrinos, which leave the NC rate and spectrum unchanged. This paper presents the first NOvA results from a search for light \u03bd s mixing by looking for a depletion of the NC event rate at the FD with respect to the prediction derived from ND observations. The NOvA experiment consists of the Far and Near Detectors, placed 810 km and 1 km from Fermilab's NuMI beam source [32], respectively. The FD is located on the surface in northern Minnesota, 14.6 mrad off the beam axis, and the ND is located at Fermilab 100 m underground and samples the same off-axis angle as the FD, ensuring similarity in the energy spectra observed at the two detectors. The NuMI neutrino beam is produced using 120 GeV protons incident on a 1.2 m-long graphite target. The kaons and pions emerging from the target are focused by two magnetic horns and either decay in flight into neutrinos over a distance of 705 m, including a 675 m decay pipe, or are absorbed. The resulting neutrino beam has a narrow energy spectrum, with a full width half maximum of approximately 1 GeV peaked at 2 GeV. The ND sees a larger solid angle as it is closer to the beam source, and hence a wider energy distribution. The beam is extracted for 10 \u00b5s every 1.33 s and is composed primarily of \u03bd \u00b5 . Simulation predicts small contaminations of 1.8%\u03bd \u00b5 and 0.7% \u03bd e +\u03bd e in the 1 -3 GeV energy range.",

We define the calorimetric energy of an event as the sum of calibrated energy deposits of the cluster. To reconstruct individual particles within an event, a Hough transform [43] is applied to the cluster and a 3D vertex is determined from a fit to the resulting lines' most likely common origin. The spatial locations of energy deposits are clustered around the vertex into prongs (clusters with defined starting point and direction), each containing deposits attributed to a final-state particle.",

This hadronic recoil appears in the detector as an isolated cluster of energy deposits, distinguishable from the charged-current (CC) interactions by the lack of a charged track, or compact energy deposit, associated with the lepton. Backgrounds arise from both misidentified CC neutrino interactions and from external sources. NuMI beam \u03bd \u00b5 CC and \u03bd e CC events, typically with high momentum transfer to the hadronic system, can be produced where the lepton may be misidentified or not reconstructed, thus mimicking a NC neutrino interaction. Backgrounds due to \u03bd \u03c4 CC events are found to be negligible. External events are primarily cosmogenic neutrons produced in the FD overburden, and NuMI beam events interacting in the periphery of the ND and in the surrounding cavern. The predicted proportions of different event types differ substantially between the two detectors: \u03bd \u00b5 CC (\u03bd e CC) interactions at the FD are suppressed (enhanced) by oscillations as compared to the ND. On average, before applying additional selections, we reconstruct 74,000 cosmogenic events for each reconstructed neutrino event in the 10 \u00b5s beam spill window at the FD.

After all selections, the effective fiducial masses of the FD and ND are 8.83 kt and 34 t, respectively. The cosmogenic background rate is estimated from NuMI-triggered data, excluding a 30 \u00b5s window centered on the beam spill. This sample reproduces the detector configuration and quality conditions of the data within the beam spill. A rejection level where only 1 in every 1.7 million cosmogenic events is misidentified as a NC signal event is obtained, equivalent to 1 cosmogenic event every 60,600 spills. At the FD (ND), we achieve a 50% (62%) NC signal efficiency and 72% (70%) NC signal purity for contained events within the fiducial volume.

Though no spectral shape information is directly used for this comparison at the FD, the FD rate prediction does have a dependence on the ND calorimetric energy shape through our extrapolation procedures, as discussed below. The FD rate is predicted from the calorimetric energy spectrum for NC-selected events in the ND. The comparison of the ND spectra in data and simulation reveals discrepancies attributable to limitations in the simulation and detector response modeling. Results from \u03bd \u00b5 CC measurements in NOvA [48] and MINERvA [49] indicate that there are unmodeled nuclear effects in GENIE (2.10.2) at low hadronic recoil energy, caused by scattering of neutrinos from correlated nucleon pairs within the nucleus [50][51][52][53]. A parallel process is expected to result in similar NC interactions, which would also be unmodeled in the simulation. The energy threshold required ensures these have a minimal effect on this analysis. An excess in the simulation rate is seen at higher hadronic recoils, consistent with measurements of \u03bd \u00b5 CC(\u03c0 + ) from the MINERvA experiment [54], which observed a data rate 1 -2 \u03c3 below simulation. Improved agreement with the ND data was achieved by applying a 35% reduction in CC and NC deep inelastic scattering events with final-state invariant mass, W , less than 1.7 GeV. This reduction models the non-resonant single pion overproduction in GENIE suggested by a recent reanalysis of \u03bd \u00b5 -deuterium pion production data [52,55]. The calorimetric energy spectra obtained from data and simulation after this correction are displayed in Fig. 2.",
