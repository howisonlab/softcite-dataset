The same-sign dilepton pairs can be either two electrons (e \u00b1 e \u00b1 ), two muons (\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ), or one electron and one muon (e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ), and must have a transverse momentum (p T ) of at least 25 (20) GeV for the leading (subleading) lepton. After selection of these pairs the resulting invariant mass distributions are examined. The data are found to be consistent with the SM background predictions, and exclusion limits are set on the fiducial cross-section of new physics in the same-sign dilepton final state. Limits are also provided separately for two positively or negatively charged leptons as a function of the dilepton invariant mass. The analysis, using the 8 TeV dataset, provides significantly stronger constraints on new physics models than that presented in earlier ATLAS publications using 4.7 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV [26,27]. Exclusion limits are also presented for the mass of pair-produced doubly charged Higgs bosons (H \u00b1\u00b1 ) [27]. The CDF experiment has performed similar inclusive searches [28,29] without observing any evidence for new physics. This search is more inclusive than other similar searches at ATLAS and CMS in events with samesign dileptons with additional requirements on missing transverse energy, jets, and charged particles [30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. Recently, the ATLAS experiment published limits on doubly charged Higgs production in multi-lepton events [37] based on the \u221a s = 8 TeV data.",

For each process the table provides information on the generator, the chosen parton distribution function (PDF) and the order of cross-section calculations used for the normalisation. The irreducible background in the analysis comes mainly from the purely leptonic decays of W Z and ZZ production processes. A small contribution arises from W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production [38], which proceeds via the t-channel exchange of a gluon and results in at least two jets in the final state, in addition to the two W bosons. The small contributions from multiple parton interactions (MPI) for W W , W Z and ZZ are also considered. In these processes two hard scatterings occur in the same pp collision, each producing either a W or Z boson. Other smaller sources of background are the processes in which a W or Z boson is produced in association with a top-quark pair (ttW and ttZ). One of the reducible backgrounds arises from the opposite-sign lepton pairs where the charge for one of the leptons is wrongly reconstructed. In order to estimate the contribution, Drell-Yan (Z/\u03b3 * +jets), tt, W \u00b1 W \u2213 and W t simulations are used, and misidentification probabilities derived from data are applied to the MC samples (see section 6.2). The process W \u03b3, where the photon converts to an e + e \u2212 pair, is also simulated. The production of Z\u03b3 is included in the Z/\u03b3 * process.",

MadGraph is used to simulate the coloured Zee-Babu process, in JHEP03(2015)041 which a diquark (S DQ ) with charge \u00b12/3 or \u00b14/3 decays into two same-sign leptoquarks (S LQ ): pp \u2192 S DQ \u2192 S LQ S LQ \u2192 \u2113\u2113qq [24]. For this process, pythia-8.165 is utilised for the fragmentation and hadronisation. For all signal samples mentioned above, the MSTW2008LO PDF set is used and cross-sections are calculated at LO in QCD.",

The isolation selections were optimised using electron pairs with a mass compatible with the Z boson in the data, such that the application of both isolation criteria to electrons yields an efficiency that is pileup independent and more than 99% for electrons with p T > 40 GeV. The efficiency slowly decreases with diminishing p T to around 92% at p T = 20 GeV.

The charge measured in the ID and the MS must match as this reduces the small effect of charge misidentification to a negligible level. To reduce background from heavy-flavour hadron decays, each muon is required to be isolated in the calorimeter and the ID. The calorimeter-based isolation is chosen to be E T < 3.5 GeV + (p \u00b5 T \u2212 20 GeV) \u00d7 0.06 where the E T is calculated in a cone of size \u2206R = 0.3 and p \u00b5 T is the muon transverse momentum.

Prompt leptons originate from a decay of a W boson, Z boson, and include any leptonic products of a prompt \u03c4 lepton decay. Non-prompt leptons are from decays of long-lived particles and mainly arise from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons (containing b or c-quarks). Hadrons or overlapping hadrons within a jet which may be misidentified as an electron are also called non-prompt leptons in the following. The prompt background comes from SM processes producing two same-sign leptons from the primary vertex, and arises mainly from W Z, ZZ, W \u00b1 W \u00b1 , ttW , and ttZ production (see section 6.1). The method used to estimate the background from lepton charge misidentification is described in section 6.2. Background from non-prompt leptons can arise from various sources and is discussed in section 6.3. For electrons, the main sources are jets misidentified as electrons and semileptonic decays of hadrons containing bor c-quarks. For muons, the main contribution arises from semileptonic decays of heavyflavour hadrons. Small contributions also come from pions and kaons that decay in flight and misidentified muons from hadronic showers in the calorimeter which reach the MS and are incorrectly matched to a reconstructed ID track. The background from SM processes in which prompt same-sign lepton pairs are produced is determined from MC simulations. Processes other than those listed in table 1 do not contribute significantly to this type of background and are neglected. In all of these samples, only reconstructed leptons are considered that are matched to a lepton at generator level from a decay of a W boson, a Z boson, and include any leptonic products of a prompt \u03c4 lepton decay.

In principle, this charge misidentification can occur for muons as well as electrons. However, a study using muons from Z boson decays shows that this effect is negligible in this analysis. In the case of electrons, the dominant process that leads to charge misidentification is electrons emitting hard bremsstrahlung and subsequently producing electronpositron pairs by photon conversion, with one of these leptons having a high p T . Typically these conversions would be reconstructed as such, but in some asymmetric conversions only one of the tracks is reconstructed and the charge may be opposite to the charge of the original lepton that radiated the photon. The charge misidentification probability is measured using electrons from Z boson decays. This is done in a data-driven way using the same likelihood method as used in ref. [26]. The electrons are required to pass the same selection cuts as detailed in sections 4 and 5, and are selected by requiring same-sign electron pairs with an invariant mass between 80 GeV and 100 GeV. This results in a very pure sample of electron pairs for which the charge of one of the electrons is incorrectly assigned. A comparison between data and MC events shows that the charge misidentification rate as a function of E T is well modelled in the simulation. Simulation is used to predict the backgrounds from Drell-Yan, tt, and W \u00b1 W \u2213 production, correcting the event weights for events with a charge-misidentified electron by an |\u03b7|-dependent factor derived from these studies.

Since this background is closely related to the electron charge misidentification, the same correction factor is applied to the electrons from converted photons in the MC simulation. The contribution of conversions from Z\u03b3 events is implicitly accounted for in the simulation of the Z/\u03b3 * process and is included in the charge misidentification category.",

In general, good agreement is seen in both the total normalisation and shapes for all channels within the uncertainties. The last bin in the figures contains the overflow bin. There is no event in the overflow in the \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel, while the mass distribution extends up to around 1300 (1100) GeV in the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 (e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ) channel. The expected and observed numbers of events for several cuts on the dilepton mass for each final state are given in table 5, which also shows the contributions from the different background types. In the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 channel the dominant background contribution comes from charge misidentification of electrons from the Drell-Yan process. In the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 and \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel the prompt production dominates the background. The prompt background predominantly arises from W Z boson production, which amounts to around 70% of the prompt background. This fraction slightly decreases for high-mass dilepton pairs. Other contributions are from ZZ and W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production and a very small fraction comes from the ttW and ttZ production or from diboson production in MPI processes. For dilepton masses m \u2113\u2113 > 500 GeV, the contribution from W \u00b1 W \u00b1 and ZZ to the prompt",

Lepton isolation is implemented by requiring that the sum of the p T of the stable charged particles with p T > 1 (0.4) GeV in a cone of size \u2206R = 0.3 around the lepton is required to be less than 7% (10%) of the lepton p T for muons (electrons).

This model is considered for diquark masses between 2.5 TeV and 3.5 TeV and leptoquark masses between 1 TeV and 1.4 TeV. The third process is a production of a right-handed W R boson decaying into a lepton and a Majorana neutrino N R , with N R subsequently decaying into a lepton and two jets, for W R masses between 1 TeV and 2 TeV, and N R masses between 250 GeV and 1.5 TeV.

The lowest values of \u01eb fid are found in the case of the fourthgeneration down-type chiral quark model, and the highest for the production of W R bosons and N R neutrinos. The primary reason for this dependence is that the electron identification efficiency varies by about 15% over the relevant p T range [75]. For muons differences in the efficiencies arise due to the detector acceptances [82], which are populated differently depending on the kinematics of the leptons produced in the new physics process. Further differences of the order of 1% arise since the calorimeter-based isolation criterion is not emulated because the isolation energy has a poor resolution in the calorimeter.

The scatter between adjacent mass bins in the observed limits is due to fluctuations in the background yields derived from limited statistics. In general, good agreement is seen between observed and expected limits with maximum deviations of 2\u03c3. In the three final states, the cross-section limits vary between 11 fb for a H \u00b1\u00b1 mass of 50 GeV to around 0.3 fb for a H \u00b1\u00b1 mass of 600 GeV. The expected cross-section curves for the pair production of H L and H R are also shown in figure 4. The lower mass limits are given by the crossing point of the cross-section limit curve and the expected curve, and are summarised in table 9. The 1\u03c3 errors on the expected limits are symmetrised to reduce the effect from bin by bin statistical fluctuations. For this scenario the best limits are obtained for H \u00b1\u00b1 L in the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 channel with a limit around 550 GeV and for H \u00b1\u00b1 R in the \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel with a limit around 430 GeV. The limits are 10-20% worse in the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel due to the larger background at high invariant masses from W Z production. The W Z gives approximately twice as many events in the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel than in the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 or \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channel whereas the signal contributions are similar in all three -22 - Observed 95% CL Observed 95% CL  Figure 4.

To make this search as inclusive as possible, there are no additional requirements on missing transverse momentum, jets, or other final-state particles. The data agree with the SM expectation and no significant deviations are observed. Fiducial cross-section limits are derived for contributions from new physics beyond the SM, which give rise to final states with two same-sign isolated leptons. The 95% CL upper limits on the cross-section are given as functions of a threshold on the invariant mass of the lepton pair. For invariant mass cuts ranging between 15 GeV and 600 GeV, the observed fiducial cross-section upper limit varies between 0.48 fb and 32 fb depending on the dilepton invariant mass and flavour combination. Limits are also set for a model of doubly charged Higgs bosons, in which doubly charged Higgs bosons are pair produced. Assuming these Higgs bosons decay exclusively into e \u00b1 e \u00b1 , e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 or \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 pairs, 95% CL lower mass limits for left-handed Higgs bosons between 465 GeV and 550 GeV are obtained depending on the flavour of the lepton pair. The mass limits for right-handed Higgs bosons range between 370 GeV and 435 GeV. These results represent a significant improvement compared to the previous ATLAS results based on \u221a s = 7 TeV data.",
