The search considers hadronic decays of the vector boson, and Higgs boson decays to b quarks. The decay products are highly boosted, and each collimated pair of quarks is reconstructed as a single, massive jet. The analysis is performed using a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The data are consistent with the background expectation and are used to place limits on the parameters of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet. In the benchmark scenario with massdegenerate W and Z bosons decaying predominantly to pairs of standard model bosons, for the first time heavy resonances for masses as high as 3.3 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, setting the most stringent constraints to date on such states decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson.",

However, the degree of fine-tuning required to accommodate the observed mass of 125 GeV [4][5][6][7] suggests the presence above 1 TeV of new heavy particles beyond the SM (BSM), possibly lying within reach of the LHC. These resonances, denoted as X, are expected to be connected to the electroweak sector of the SM, with significant couplings to the SM bosons. Hence, these heavy resonances potentially could be observed through their decay into a vector boson (V = W or Z) and a Higgs boson.",

The heavy vector triplet (HVT) framework [17] extends the SM by introducing a triplet of heavy vector bosons, one neutral Z and two charged W s, collectively represented as V' and degenerate in mass. The heavy vector bosons couple to SM bosons and fermions with strengths g V c H and g 2 c F /g V , respectively, where g V is the strength of the new interaction, c H is the coupling between the HVT bosons, the Higgs boson, and longitudinally polarized SM vector bosons, c F is the coupling between the HVT bosons and the SM fermions, and g is the SU (2) L gauge coupling. In this paper, two different benchmark scenarios are considered [17]. In model A (g V = 1, c H = \u22120.556, c F = \u22121.316), the coupling strengths to the SM bosons and fermions are comparable, and the new particles decay primarily to fermions. In model B (g V = 3, c H = \u22120.976, c F = 1.024), the couplings to fermions are suppressed with respect to the couplings to bosons, resulting in a branching fraction to SM bosons close to unity.",

Use of the hadronic decay modes takes advantage of the large branching fractions, which compensate for the effect of the large multijet background. This search concentrates on the high mass region, as previous searches [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] have excluded m X in the region below a few TeV. As a result of the large resonance mass, the two bosons produced in the decay have large Lorentz boosts in the laboratory frame, and consequently the hadronic decay products of each boson tend to be clustered within a single hadronic jet. The jet mass, substructure, and b tagging information are crucial to identifying hadronically decaying vector bosons and Higgs boson candidates, and to discriminating against the dominant SM backgrounds.",

The algorithm identifies each reconstructed particle either as an electron, a muon, a photon, a charged hadron, or a neutral hadron. The PF candidates are clustered into jets using the anti-k T algorithm [43,44] with a distance parameter R = 0.8, after passing the charged-hadron subtraction (CHS) pileup mitigation algorithm [45]. For each event, a primary vertex is identified as the one with the highest sum of the p 2 T of the associated reconstructed objects, jets and identified leptons, and missing transverse momentum. The CHS algorithm removes charged PF candidates with a track longitudinal impact parameter not compatible with this primary vertex. The contribution to a jet of neutral particles originating from pileup interactions, assumed to be proportional to the jet area [46], is subtracted from the jet energy. Jet energy corrections as a function of the p T and \u03b7 are extracted from simulation and data in dijet, multijet, \u03b3 +jets, and leptonic Z+jets events. The jet energy resolution typically amounts to 5% at 1 TeV [47,48]. Jets are required to pass identification criteria in order to remove spurious jets arising from detector noise [49]. This requirement has negligible impact on the signal efficiency.",

Muons are reconstructed within the acceptance of the CMS muon systems, |\u03b7| < 2.4, using the information from both the muon spectrometer and the silicon tracker [57]. The isolation of electrons and muons is based on the summed energy of reconstructed PF candidates within a cone around the lepton direction. Hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons are reconstructed in the |\u03b7| < 2.3 region by combining one or three hadronic charged PF candidates with up to two neutral pions, the latter also reconstructed by the PF algorithm from the photons arising from the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay [58].

The parameter g V represents the coupling strength of the new interaction, c H the coupling between the HVT bosons and the Higgs boson and longitudinally polarized SM vector bosons, and c F the coupling between the heavy vector bosons and the SM fermions. The benchmark scenarios corresponding to HVT model A and model B are represented by a purple cross and a red point. The gray shaded areas correspond to the region where the resonance natural width is predicted to be larger than the typical experimental resolution (4%) and thus the narrow-width approximation does not apply with the hadronic decay modes of the vector boson and the decay mode of the Higgs boson to a bb pair. The data sample was collected by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV during 2016, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Within the framework of the heavy vector triplet model, mass-dependent upper limits in the range 0.9-90 fb are set on the product of the cross section for production of a narrow spin-1 resonance and the combined branching fraction for its decay to a vector boson and a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of b quarks. Compared to previous measurements, the range of resonance masses excluded within the framework of benchmark model B of the heavy vector triplet model is extended substantially to values as high as 3.3 TeV. More generally, the results lead to a significant reduction in the allowed parameter space for heavy vector triplet models. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
