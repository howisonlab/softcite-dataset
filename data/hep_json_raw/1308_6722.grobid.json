Experimentally, DD events are typically associated with a rapidity gap that is large compared to random multiplicity fluctuations. Rapidity gaps are exponentially suppressed in nondiffractive (ND) events [4]; however, when a detector is not able to detect particles with the transverse momentum (p T ) of a few hundred MeV, the identification of double diffractive events by means of rapidity gaps becomes very challenging. The excellent p T acceptance of the TOTEM detectors makes the experiment favorable for the measurement. Previous measurements of the DD cross section are described in Refs. [5,6].",

The DD events were selected by vetoing T1 tracks and requiring tracks in T2, hence selecting events that have two diffractive systems with 4:7 < jj min < 6:5, where min is the minimum pseudorapidity of all primary particles produced in the diffractive system. Although these events are only about 3% of the total DD , they provide a pure selection of DD events and the measurement is an important step towards determining if there is a rich resonance structure in the low mass region [9]. To probe further, the min range was divided into two subregions on each side, providing four subcategories for the measurement.",

In the first step, the raw rate of double diffractive events is estimated: the selected sample is corrected for trigger efficiency, pileup, and T1 multiplicity, and the amount of background is determined. In the second step, the visible cross section, i.e., the cross section for events that have at least one particle in both sides of 5:3 < jj < 6:5 and no particles within 3:1 < jj < 4:7, is calculated by correcting the raw rate up to the particle level. Because roughly half of neutral only events produce a charged secondary particle [10], the acceptance and efficiency of detecting both charged and neutral particles are considered in the corrections. In the last step, the visible cross section is corrected so that both diffractive systems have 4:7 < jj min < 6:5. This jj min range roughly corresponds to the diffractive mass range of 3:4 < M diff < 8:0 GeV. This measurement uses data collected in October 2011 at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV during a low pileup run with a special \u00c3 \u00bc 90 m optics. The data were collected with the T2 minimum bias trigger. The trigger condition was that three out of 10 superpads in the same r \u00c0 sector fired. A superpad consists of three radial and five azimuthal neighboring pads, and it is sufficient that one out of 15 pads registered a signal for a superpad to be fired.",

T2 tracks with a 2 -fit probability smaller than 2% and tracks falling in the overlap region of two T2 quarters, i.e., tracks with 80 < < 100 or 260 < < 280 , were removed. The tracks in the overlap region were removed because simulation does not model well their response. In the Letter, this full selection for a visible cross section is named I track . The four subcategories for the visible cross-section measurement were defined by the T2 track with minimum jj on each side, j \u00fe track j min and j \u00c0 track j min . The subcategory D11 track includes the events with 5:3 < j AE track j min < 5:9, D22 track the events with 5:9 < j AE track j min < 6:5, D12 track the events with 5:3 < j \u00fe track j min < 5:9 and 5:9 < j \u00c0 track j min < 6:5, and D21 track the events with 5:9 < j \u00fe track j min < 6:5 and 5:3 < j \u00c0 track j min < 5:9. Two additional samples were extracted for background estimation. A control sample for single diffractive (SD) events has at least one track in either of the T2 arms and no tracks in the opposite side T2 arm nor in T1 (1T2 \u00fe 0T1). A control sample for ND events has tracks in all arms of T2 and T1 detectors (2T2 \u00fe 2T1). Four additional exclusive data samples were defined for testing the background model validity: tracks in both arms of T2 and exactly in one arm of T1 (2T2 \u00fe 1T1), tracks in either of T2 arms and in both T1 arms (1T2 \u00fe 2T1), tracks in T2 and T1 in one side of the interaction point (1T2 \u00fe 1T1 same side), and tracks in T2 and T1 in the opposite side of the interaction point (1T2 \u00fe 1T1 opposite side).

The experimental correction E \u00bc 0:90 AE 0:10 for the I track selection. The correction E includes the acceptance, the tracking, and reconstruction efficiencies of the T2 detector (1.19 for the I track selection on either side of the IP), the correction of events with only neutral particles within the detector acceptance (1.10), bin migration (0.95), and veto efficiency (0.77). The correction E was estimated using PYTHIA, and the largest  difference with respect to QGSJET-II-03 [16] and PHOJET was taken as the uncertainty. The D12 track , D21 track , and D22 track subcategories have an additional correction factor related to the 5:3 < j track j min < 5:9 veto. Monte Carlo simulations underestimate the number of secondary particles [10], and therefore we checked the veto efficiency from data. 2T2 \u00fe 2T1 and 1T2 \u00fe 1T1 same side selections provide samples where a rapidity gap of 5:3 < j track j < 5:9 is not expected. We checked the ratio N 5:9<j track j min <6:5 =N total between data and MC in the 2T2 \u00fe 2T1 and 1T2 \u00fe 1T1 same side samples, and determined the additional correction factor in such a way that the MC ratio is consistent with data. The value of the correction factor is 1:22 AE 0:03 (1:24 AE 0:03) for the positive (negative) side, and it is an additional component to E of the D12 track , D21 track , and D22 track subcategories.",
