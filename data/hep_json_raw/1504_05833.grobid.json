            "text": "This Letter presents measurements of the total and differential cross sections of inclusive Higgs boson production using 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector [2]. The measured cross sections probe the properties of the Higgs boson and can be directly compared to the theoretical modeling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, such as the most recent gluon fusion (ggF) QCD calculations. They can also be used to constrain new physics scenarios, for example using the effective field theory framework as proposed in Refs. [3][4][5][6][7]. The analysis uses event yields measured in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l decays and detector efficiencies, both determined as described in Refs. [8,9]. The statistical uncertainties on the Higgs boson signal yields in both channels are larger than the systematic uncertainties, while the total uncertainties in the two channels are similar. Combining the analyses improves the precision of the cross-section measurements by up to 40%, and by 25%-30% on average, with respect to the corresponding measurements in the most precise individual channel. Distributions of the differential pp \u2192 H cross sections are reported as a function of the transverse momentum p H T and the rapidity jy H j of the Higgs boson, the jet multiplicity N jets , and the transverse momentum of the leading jet p j1",

The jy H j distribution furthermore offers a clean probe of the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) and will play a role in future PDF fits. The N jets and p j1 T observables probe the theoretical modeling of partonic radiation in ggF production as well as the overall rate and modeling of jets in vector-boson fusion (VBF) and associated Higgs boson production (VH and ttH). Jets produced in VBF, VH, and ttH processes tend to have higher transverse momenta than those produced via ggF production; however, the sensitivity to measuring these contributions is weak with the current amount of data.",

A complementary approach, using a separate likelihood, measures the shape of the differential distributions by imposing a unity normalization constraint, which removes the implicit SM assumption on the branching fractions. For the extraction of the signal yields and the corrections of detector efficiencies, it is assumed that the signal in both channels is due to a narrow resonance with a mass m H \u00bc 125.36 AE 0.41 GeV as measured by the ATLAS Collaboration [11]. The signal yield in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel is obtained from fits to the diphoton mass spectra [8], and from the background subtracted data yield in a m 4l mass window of 118 to 129 GeV for the H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l channel [9]. The fiducial acceptance in both channels [8,9] is derived using a set of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. POWHEG-BOX [12][13][14], interfaced with PYTHIA8 [15] for showering, is used to generate ggF and VBF events, while PYTHIA8 is used to simulate VH and associated production with top quarks (ttH) and b-quarks (bbH). The fiducial acceptance for events with jy H j < 1.2 is approximately 72% for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and 55%-59% for H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l. For higher jy H j, the acceptance decreases to 35%-38% in both channels. The fiducial acceptance is more constant as a function of the other variables and is in the range 56%-62% for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel and 44%-53% for the H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l channel [16].",

Experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties affecting the signal yields, detector efficiencies, branching fractions, and fiducial acceptance corrections are taken into account in the likelihood as constrained nuisance parameters. Nuisance parameters describing the same uncertainty sources are treated as fully correlated between bins and channels. Systematic uncertainties on the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l background estimates and efficiency correction factors, as well as the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity, are described in detail in Refs. [8,9]. The branching fraction uncertainty due to the assumed quark masses and other theoretical uncertainties are evaluated following the recommendations of Ref. [17], considering uncertainty correlations between the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l decay channels. Uncertainties on the acceptance correction related to the choice of PDF set are evaluated by taking the envelope of the sum in quadratures of eigenvector variations of the baseline (CT10 [18]) and the central values of alternative (MSTW2008NLO [19] and NNPDF2.3 [20]) PDF sets. Uncertainties on the acceptance correction associated with missing higher-order corrections are evaluated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales coherently and individually by factors of 0.5 and 2 from their nominal values, and by reweighting the p H T distribution from POWHEG-BOX to the prediction of the HRES 2.2 calculation [21,22]. The envelope of the maximum deviation of the combined scale variations and the p H T reweighting is used as the systematic variation. To account for the uncertainty in the mass measurement, the Higgs boson mass is varied by AE0.4 GeV. To assess the systematic uncertainty due to the assumption of SM cross-section fractions of the Higgs boson production modes, the VBF and VH fractions are varied by factors of 0.5 and 2 from the SM prediction and the fraction of ttH is varied by factors of 0 and 5. These factors are based on current experimental bounds [23][24][25][26][27].",

[10], is accurate to next-tonext-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and utilizes threshold resummation accurate to next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL). A significant effort has been undertaken by the theory community to provide ggF cross sections beyond this precision through various improvements in the perturbative calculations [28][29][30][31][32][33]. Recently, the ADDFGHLM group has provided a fixed-order calculation accurate to next-to-nextto-next-leading order (N 3 LO) [34][35][36][37]  [10].

The results of the two channels are compatible and have similar precision. The measurements indicate that the total production cross section of the Higgs boson is larger, and that it is produced with larger transverse momentum and more associated jets than predicted by the current most advanced SM calculations; however, more data is needed to confirm these observations.
