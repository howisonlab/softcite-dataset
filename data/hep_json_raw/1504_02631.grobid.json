The charged Zc(4020) is its decay into \u03c0 \u00b1 hc final state, and carries electric charge, thus it contains at least four quarks. The observation of both charge and neutral state makes Zc(4020) the first iso-spin triplet Zc state observed in experiment.",

            "text": "In quark model, hadrons are made up of quarks. At the lowest configuration, one quark and one anti-quark form meson while three quarks do baryon [1]. But hadrons with other configurations, called exotic states, are not excluded, such as deuteron, which is formed with a proton and a neutron [2,3]. The search for these exotic states has stimulated great interest. Although no convincible evidence has been found in experimental, strong evidence for mesons that do not fit into the simple qq-bar scheme of the quark model has been accumulating during the past decade, such as X(3872) [4][5][6][7], Y(4260) [8], Z(4430) + [9][10][11][12] in charmonium region.",

This state has not been confirmed from BaBar [11] using the same analysis method. Until the result reported by LHCb in 2014 [12], the Z(4430) + has been confirmed with ambitious significance, and the quantum number is determined to be 1 + . The first confirmed charged charmoniumlike state is Z c (3900) observed in \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 mass spectrum in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 process at BESIII using data sample taken at \u221a s = 4.26 GeV [13]. This state has been confirmed shortly by Belle experiment [14] and CLEO-c [15] using same decay mode. Besides, in CLEO-c data, an evidence of neutral Z c (3900) has also been reported in the neutral process. The observation of Z c (3900) has attracted great interest from both theoretical and experimental side. Different models have been proposed, such as tetraquark consisting of cu andcd diquarks [16], molecule consisting of D * and D [17], hadroquarkonium consisting of ud bound to a color-singlet cc core [18], or other configurations [19]. Almost in the same, the study of the (DD * ) \u00b1 and (D * D * ) \u00b1 system in (DD * ) \u00b1 \u03c0 and (D * D * ) \u00b1 \u03c0 states in the same data sample have been performed, and strong near-threshold peaks has been observed, which is named as Z c (3885) [20] and Z c (4025) [23], respectively.",

The mass of Z c (4020) is close to that of the mentioned Z c (4025) \u00b1 observed in (D * D * ) \u00b1 \u03c0 states.

The cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0hc at different energy points and the ratios (R \u03c0\u03c0hc )between charged and neutral modes. For the first three energy points, besides the upper limits, the central values and the statistical errors are also listed. The second errors are systematic errors and the third ones are from the measurement of branching fraction of hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c [26]. The process of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c was first observed by CLEO-c experiment using 586 pb The BESIII experiment, works at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC) II, is a tau-charm factory which can collect data from \u221a s = 2 GeV to 4.6 GeV [24]. Starting from the end of 2012 to 2013, BESIII detector collected about 3.3 fb \u22121 data samples at 13 CM energies from 3.900 to 4.420 GeV, which are listed in Table I. Based on these data samples, the process of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0h c has been studied using full reconstruction of the final state particles. Here the h c is reconstructed via its electric-dipole (E1) transition h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c with \u03b7 c reconstructed with its 16 hadronic decay modes: pp, \u03c0",

The comparison of the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c measured at BESIII with the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 measured at Belle experiment using initial state radiative (ISR) method [14] is shown in Figure1. The cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 h c is at the same order of magnitude of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 but with a different line shape. There is a possible broad structure at high energy with a local maximum around 4.23 GeV. Since the Y(4260) was established from the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, the different line shape e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c makes the understanding of Y states more complicate.  Combining the Born cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 h c with that of charged mode, the ratios of cross section between charged and neutral mode (R \u03c0\u03c0hc ) at each energy points are calculated, as listed in Table I. In the calculation, the common systematic uncertainties in the two measurements have been canceled. The combined ratio for the 3 energy points R \u03c0\u03c0hc , obtained with a weighted least squares method [27], is determined to be 0.63 \u00b1 0.09, which agrees with the expectation based on isospin symmetry within a systematic uncertainty of 0.5.",
