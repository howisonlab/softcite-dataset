            "text": "The top quark could play a central role in the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism of the standard model (SM) and in numerous physics models beyond the SM (BSM). Measurements of the differential production cross sections for top quark pair (tt) production test SM predictions, while also probing scenarios of BSM physics. Such measurements also allow determination of the top quark mass (m t ), the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ), and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. In this paper the dilepton decay JHEP02 (2019)149channel of the tt process is utilised. Although the dilepton channel has a relatively small branching fraction, it has significantly lower backgrounds than the other tt decay channels. As a consequence of the excellent lepton energy resolution, the precise measurement of kinematic observables based on lepton pairs is unique to the dilepton channel. However, because of the presence of two neutrinos in the final state, the measurement of top quark kinematic observables in the dilepton channel requires specialised kinematic reconstruction techniques.",

            "text": "Differential tt cross sections have been measured by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC in proton-proton (pp) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. In this paper, measurements of absolute and normalised differential tt cross sections are presented. The measurements are based on either particle-level objects and extrapolated to a fiducial phase space close to that of the detector acceptance or on parton-level top quarks extrapolated to the full phase space. In the absolute measurements, the integrated and differential cross sections are measured simultaneously. In the normalised measurements, the integrated cross sections are not measured and the uncertainties affecting only the normalisations of the differential cross sections in both data and predictions are reduced. The measurements represent the most comprehensive study of tt production in the dilepton channel to date. Furthermore, this work includes a more detailed treatment of the systematic uncertainties compared to previous CMS measurements of the tt differential cross sections in the dilepton channel at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, and approximately 17 times more data than the previous CMS measurement at 13 TeV using data recorded in 2015.",

The absence of signals of such new states in the LHC data recorded so far suggests that BSM physics might only be directly manifested at an energy scale that is large with respect to the typical scales probed at the LHC. In this case, the new states are only produced virtually at the LHC. These virtual effects can modify the rates and kinematic properties of tt events. Theoretically, these effects can be accommodated by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian in an effective field theory (EFT). The reduced model dependence of the particle-level results makes them particularly suitable to constrain BSM theories.",

In this paper, the measured particle-level differential tt cross section as a function of the azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons is used to constrain the CMDM in an EFT framework. Signals of BSM physics could also appear in tt production as anomalous top quark or leptonic charge asymmetries.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [30]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the highlevel trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimised for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [31].",

            "text": "The simulation of physics processes is important in order to estimate event reconstruction and selection efficiencies, resolutions of the event reconstruction, and to provide predictions for the tt signal and backgrounds. This motivates the use of MC generators interfaced to a detector simulation. The default simulation setup for the tt process is provided at NLO in QCD at the matrix-element (ME) level by the powheg (v.2) [32][33][34][35] generator (powheg). For this setup, the h damp parameter of powheg, which regulates the damping of real emissions in the NLO calculation when matching to the parton shower, is set to 1.58 m t = 272.72 GeV as a result of the tuning of this parameter from ref. [36]. The generated events are subsequently processed with the pythia (v. 8.219) [37] program (pythia), with the CUETP8M2T4 tune [36,38,39], for parton showering and hadronisation. In order to compare the predictive powers of alternative ME, parton shower, and hadronisation models, two additional samples are generated using different generator setups. Firstly, a sample is generated using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo [40] (v. 2.2.2) (mg5 amc@nlo) generator including up to two extra partons at the ME level with NLO precision. In this setup, referred to as \"mg5 amc@nlo+pythia [FxFx]\", MadSpin [41] is used to model the decays of the top quarks, while preserving their spin correlation, and events are matched to pythia for parton showering and hadronisation using the FxFx prescription [42]. Secondly, a sample is generated with powheg at NLO in QCD at the ME level and interfaced with herwig++ (v. 2.7.1) [43] with the EE5C tune [44] for parton showering and hadronisation. This setup is referred to as powheg+herwig++.",

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Pileup can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy deposits to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum imbalance in dijet, photon+jets, Z+jets, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy in data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied to remove badly reconstructed jets. Jets are selected if they have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets are rejected if the distance in \u03b7-\u03c6 space between the jet and the closest lepton, \u2206R(jet, lepton), is less than 0.4. Jets originating from the hadronisation of b quarks (b jets) are identified (b tagged) by combining information related to secondary decay vertices reconstructed within the jets and track-based lifetime information in an algorithm CSV (v.2) [60] that provides a b jet identification efficiency of \u224879-87% and a probability to misidentify light-flavour jets as b jets of \u224810%.",

The algorithm examines all combinations of jets and leptons and solves a system of equations based on the following constraints: p miss T is assumed to originate solely from the two neutrinos; the invariant mass of the reconstructed W boson must JHEP02(2019)149 equal 80.4 GeV [62]; and the invariant mass of each reconstructed top quark must equal 172.5 GeV. Effects of detector resolution are accounted for by randomly varying the measured energies and directions of the reconstructed lepton and b jet candidates by their resolutions as measured in simulation. This procedure is referred to in the following to as smearing. In addition, the assumed invariant mass of the W boson is smeared according to the Breit-Wigner distribution of W boson masses in simulation. For a given smearing, the solution of the equations for the neutrino momenta yielding the smallest invariant mass of the tt system is chosen. For each solution, a weight is calculated based on the spectrum of the true invariant mass of the lepton and b jet system from simulated top quark decays at particle level. The weights are summed over 100 smearings for each combination, and the kinematic observables of the top quark and antiquark are calculated as a weighted average. The smearing procedure increases the fraction of combinations in which a valid solution to the system of equations is found. Increasing the number of smearings beyond 100 did not significantly increase this fraction further. The top quark and antiquark candidates are distinguished according to the charge of the lepton in the chosen solution. The solution with the most b-tagged jets is chosen to represent the top quark momenta. If multiple combinations with the same number of b-tagged jets are found, the combination that yields the maximum sum of weights is chosen. The efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction, defined as the number of events where a solution is found divided by the total number of selected tt events, is about 90% in both data and simulation. Events with no valid solution for the neutrino momenta are excluded from further analysis.",

These effects are accounted for with a regularised unfolding method [8,63,64]. For each measured distribution, a response matrix that accounts for migrations and efficiencies is calculated using the default tt simulation. For the parton-level measurements in the full phase space, the response matrix also accounts for the branching fraction of tt events into two leptons excluding \u03c4 leptons. The generalised inverse of the response matrix is used to obtain the unfolded distribution from the measured distribution by applying a \u03c7 2 minimisation technique. Regularisation is applied to suppress nonphysical fluctuations. The regularisation level is determined individually for each distribution using the average squared global correlation method [65]. To keep the bin-to-bin migrations small, the width of the measurement bins are chosen according to their purity and stability. Purity is defined as the fraction of events in a given bin at the detector level that originate from the same bin at the generator level, and stability is defined as the fraction of events in a given bin at the generator level that are reconstructed in the same bin at the detector level. The purities and stabilities are typically \u224850%, except in the regions where the distributions are steeply rising or falling, where values of 30% are typical. The statistical uncertainty is small in comparison to the systematic uncertainties in all bins. The data in the three channels are combined before unfolding in order to model correlations between channels and reduce statistical uncertainties in poorly populated regions of the unfolding matrix.",

The efficiencies of the dilepton triggers in data are measured as the fraction of events passing triggers based on a p miss T requirement that also satisfy the dilepton trigger criteria. As the efficiency of the p miss T requirement is independent from the dilepton trigger efficiencies, the bias introduced by the p miss T requirement is negligible. The efficiencies are close to unity in both data and simulation. An uncertainty arising from the modelling of the trigger efficiencies in simulation is estimated by two variations of the scale factors. First, the scale factors are varied within their uncertainties coherently for all leptons. Second, to account for potential differential effects not covered by the coherent variations, simulated events are divided into categories according to the \u03b7 of the leptons, and the scale factors are varied in opposite directions for each category. A final trigger uncertainty is derived by taking the maximal deviation produced by the two variations in each bin.",

In order to probe the modelling of the top quark p T as thoroughly as possible, various differential cross sections related to the p T of top quarks are measured. These include: the separate p T of the top quarks and antiquarks in the laboratory frame and, in order to suppress the effects of JHEP02 (2019)149initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR), in the tt rest frame (RF), and the largest (leading) and second-largest p T (trailing) top quark or antiquark in an event. Similarly, the rapidity distributions are determined separately for top quarks and antiquarks, as well as the rapidity of the leading and trailing top quark or antiquark in an event. The differential cross sections as a function of the differences in absolute rapidities between the top quark and antiquark and in absolute pseudorapidities between the lepton and antilepton are measured to allow the extraction of the tt and leptonic charge asymmetries described in section 9. The p T of the tt system and N jets distributions are measured since they are especially sensitive to the higher-order terms in the perturbative calculations. The rapidity and invariant mass distributions of the tt system are measured because of their potential to reduce gluon PDF uncertainties at large fractions of the proton longitudinal momentum carried by the gluon. In addition, for small values of m tt , the m tt distribution is sensitive to m t , while for large values of m tt , it is sensitive to BSM scenarios in which heavy states decay to tt pairs. The measurements of the lepton kinematic observables test the modelling of the top quark decays and spin correlations in the tt pair. Measuring the b jet kinematic observables further tests the modelling of the top quark decays, while also testing the parton shower and hadronisation models.",

The powheg+herwig++ simulation provides a better modelling of the top quark p T distributions, where a deficit of data for high p T at the parton level is the only observed disagreement. For all MC-based predictions, the deficit at high p T is most pronounced for the p t T (trailing) distribution.

For the m tt distributions in figures 30 and 31, a significant excess of data with respect to all predictions in the lowest bin is observed.

            "text": "-49 - properties of tt production. The top quark may also have an anomalous chromoelectric dipole moment, however in this analysis it is assumed to be zero following the theoretical treatment presented in ref. [28]. Until recently, the effect of an anomalous CMDM on tt production was calculated only at LO in QCD. In ref. [28], predictions for tt production with anomalous CMDM at NLO in QCD in an EFT framework are provided. A comparison of the LO and NLO predictions reveals that the effect of the CMDM on tt production is underestimated at LO, and that the NLO predictions have reduced scale uncertainties with respect to those at LO. These two factors allow stronger constraints on the CMDM to be extracted using NLO predictions than with those at LO. In an EFT framework, the scale of new physics (\u039b) is assumed to be large with respect to the typical scales probed at the LHC. Under this condition, BSM effects can be modelled in an EFT by adding a fixed set of dimension-6 operators to the SM Lagrangian [80,81]. An operator commonly referred to as O tG is responsible for anomalous CMDM effects in the EFT [28]. The contribution of O tG to the Lagrangian is parameterized by the dimensionless Wilson coefficient divided by the square of the BSM scale (C tG /\u039b 2 ). The O tG operator results in a new ggtt vertex, and modifies the gtt vertex, resulting in altered rates and kinematic properties in tt production. Furthermore, changes in the chirality of the top quarks induced by O tG modify the spin correlation of the tt pair. Thus, both the rate of tt production and the difference in the azimuthal angle between the two leptons in dileptonic tt events, \u2206\u03c6( ,\u00af ), are sensitive to the value of C tG /\u039b 2 .

[28] is implemented in the mg5 amc@nlo generator for the ME calculation at NLO in QCD. The parton shower and hadronisation steps are performed by interfacing this setup with pythia. The rivet framework [82] is used to apply the object definitions and requirements in order to produce particle-level predictions in the fiducial phase space identical to that of the measurements presented in this paper. The normalisations of the predictions are scaled with a K factor to account for the NNLO+NNLL corrections to the inclusive tt cross section calculated in ref. [83]. However, as the acceptance of the fiducial phase space is calculated only at NLO precision, the normalisations of the predictions are not fully NNLO+NNLL precise. Since the p t T distribution is poorly modelled by the NLO generators, the predictions are additionally corrected in order to match the p t T prediction provided in ref. [74] that corresponds to NNLO precision in QCD and includes electroweak corrections up to \u03b1 3 EW .

The measured charge asymmetries and corresponding uncertainties are: A tt c (parton level) = 0.01 \u00b1 0.009, A tt c (particle level) = 0.008 \u00b1 0.009, and A \u00af c (particle level) = \u22120.005 \u00b1 0.004. In figure 55, the central values and the 68 and 95% CI bands are compared with the SM predictions produced with the powheg and mg5 amc@nlo generators interfaced with pythia, and a calculation at NLO precision in QCD and including corrections arising from mixing between QCD and electroweak diagrams, and between QCD and quantum electrodynamics (QED) diagrams taken from ref.

            "text": "Measurements of differential tt cross sections using events containing two oppositely charged leptons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are presented. The data were recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 and correspond to a integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The differential cross sections are presented as functions of numerous observables related to tt production and decay and are based on both particle-level objects in a phase space close to that of the detector acceptance and partonlevel top quarks in the full phase space. For each observable, absolute and normalised differential cross sections are presented. Most measured differential cross sections are well modelled by theoretical predictions. However, significant disagreement between the data and Monte Carlo simulation with next-to-leading-order (NLO) precision in quantum chromodynamics is observed for the transverse momentum of top quarks, leptons, b jets, tt, \u00af , and bb systems, and the invariant mass of the tt, \u00af , and bb systems. Predictions with beyond-NLO precision are generally in closer agreement with the data although some significant discrepancies remain. The jet multiplicity distribution is not well described by any of the Monte Carlo predictions.  Figure 55. The results of the A x c extraction (x = tt or \u00af ) from integrating the normalised partonand particle-level differential cross section measurements as a function of \u2206|y|(t, t) and \u2206\u03b7( ,\u00af ) are shown. The central values for the data are indicated by the solid lines with the 68 and 95% CIs represented by the dark and light shaded bands, respectively. The three types of dashed lines indicate the SM predictions produced with the mg5 amc@nlo and powheg generators, both interfaced with pythia, and a calculation at NLO precision in QCD and including corrections arising from mixing between QCD and electroweak diagrams, and between QCD and QED diagrams [90]. a function of \u2206\u03c6( ,\u00af ) is used to constrain the top quark chromomagnetic dipole moment at NLO precision in quantum chromodynamics using an effective field theory framework. The tt and leptonic charge asymmetries are measured using 13 TeV data for the first time and found to be in agreement with standard model predictions.",
