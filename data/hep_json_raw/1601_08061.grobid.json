The cross section is well described by the vector meson dominance model.

            "text": "Nowadays, great attention is paid to both experimental and theoretical studies of the \u03c0 0 \u03b3 ( * ) \u03b3 ( * ) transition form factor. This interest is mainly due to the problem of calculating the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 [1]. The theoretical uncertainty of this contribution is responsible for a sizable part of the uncertainty of the (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 calculation. Experimental data on the form factors needed for development of phenomenological models are derived from measurements of two-photon \u03c0 0 production e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 , two-photon and conversion decays \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3e + e \u2212 , and e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 , and the radiative process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3. Investigations of these processes are planned in various experiments (Belle-2, BES-III, KLOE-II, SND, CMD-3).",

The values of these probabilities for low-lying vector resonances \u03c1(770), \u03c9(782) and \u03c6(1020) are widely used in phenomenological models, in particular, to fix their quark content. The radiative decays of the excited states of light mesons have been studied very badly. Since these probabilities are sensitive to the quark content of the mesons, their measurements are important to search for exotic states (glueballs, hybrid mesons), which are predicted in the mass range between 1 and 2 GeV.",

From these data, only \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decay has been measured with a relatively high accuracy. The combined SND and CMD-2 result on the product B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) has an uncertainty of 2.6%. However, the value of this product differs by 7% from that calculated using B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3) and B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) given in the Particle Data Group (PDG) table [5]. This difference is caused by existing contradictions between the measured values of B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 )B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), and B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)/B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ). The two latter parameters have accuracies of 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively, and determine the current PDG value of B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3). To resolve or enhance this contradiction, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 cross-section measurement near the \u03c9-resonance peak.",

The formal accuracy of the PDG value for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 branching fraction is better than 5%. This PDG value is obtained by averaging the measurements [2,4] with a systematic error of about 8% each. The systematic error arises from the uncertainty in the nonresonant amplitude interfering with the amplitude of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decay. The nonresonant amplitude is determined by the tails of the \u03c1 and \u03c9 resonances, as well as by the contributions of higher excitations of the vector resonances. To reduce this systematic error, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 cross section in the wide energy range, from 0.6 up to at least 1.4 GeV.",

There are at least two clusters in the calorimeter with the energy deposition larger than 30 MeV, no tracks found by the FLT track finder in the tracking system, and no signal in the muon system. The total energy deposition in the calorimeter should exceed a threshold, which varies with energy, but is always below 0.4 \u221a s. The preliminary selection criteria for reconstructed events are also the same for the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 3\u03b3. There are no charged particles in an event.

The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 candidate events should have at least three reconstructed photons with the energy larger than 50 MeV. For these events we perform a kinematic fit with four constraints of energy and momentum balance. For events  with more than three photons, the fit uses parameters of three photons with highest energy. The distribution of \u03c7 2 of the kinematic fit (\u03c7 2 3\u03b3 ) is shown in Fig. 1.

In the region \u221a s > 1.06 GeV, where the signal-to-background ratio is low, a tighter condition \u03c7 2 3\u03b3 < 20 is used.

In the energy region near the \u03c6(1020) resonance the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 should be also taken into account. It increases background by about 40% in the resonance peak. The background composition outside the \u03c6-meson region is 30% from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and 70% from e + e \u2212 \u2192 3\u03b3. All background processes have the M rec distribution not peaked near the \u03c0 0 mass. The simulation shows that the shape of the M rec distribution in the chosen mass window 80 < M rec < 190 MeV/c 2 for the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 3\u03b3 is close to linear in the range 0.6 \u2264 \u221a s \u2264 1.06 GeV.

An inaccuracy of background-shape simulation in this energy range may be a serious source of the systematic uncertainty in determination of the number of signal events. We don't see any clear \u03c0 0 signal over background in the M rec spectrum for energies below 0.6 GeV. Since the total integrated luminosity collected at eight energy points between 0.36 and 0.58 GeV is lower than that for the energy point \u221a s = 0.6 GeV, we exclude these points from the current analysis. The simulation predicts the number of background events with an accuracy better than 5% in the \u03c6(1020) region and below, and with an accuracy of about 10-15% above. In the fit to the M rec spectrum, the background distribution is described by the distribution obtained from simulation plus a linear function.

Selection of e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 events described in detail in Ref. [13] fully removes background from \u03c9 decays. The N 2\u03b3 /N e + e \u2212 energy dependence is fitted by a sum of a linear function and a Breit-Wigner function describing the \u03c9-resonance contribution. The resonance background fraction is found to be (0.3 \u00b1 0.3)% at the \u03c9 peak. To take into account the contribution of this resonance, we multiply the \u03b5 2\u03b3 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 /\u03b5 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 ratio used in Eq. (1) by a factor of 1.04 \u00b1 0.04. A similar procedure is used to subtract e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 background in the \u03c6-meson energy region. It is found to be less than that in the \u03c9 energy region by a factor of 20. Another source of background near the \u03c6-resonance is the decay chain \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 \u2192 3\u03b3. To suppress the \u03b7\u03b3 background by a factor of about 4, the additional cut E \u03b3,min < 0.125 \u221a s is applied in the energy region 0.984 < \u221a s < 1.060 GeV for events with \u03c7 2 3\u03b3 < 100, where E \u03b3,min is the energy of the third, less energetic photon in an event. With this cut the fraction of the \u03b7\u03b3 background does not exceed 0.5%. Total resonance background in the \u03c6-meson energy region is about 0.8%.

For the cross sections, the systematic uncertainty includes the uncertainty of luminosity determination (1.2%), the uncertainty of the detection efficiency (0.6% for \u03c3 \u03c1 , \u03c3 \u03c9 , \u03c3 \u03c6 ), and uncertainties associated with the model of the V \u2032 energy-dependent width and inaccuracies of the resonance masses and widths. It should be noted that a systematic uncertainty on \u03c3 \u03c9 is determined by the errors of the luminosity and detection efficiency, and weakly depends on other sources. The main contribution to the \u03c3 \u03c1 systematic uncertainty comes from inaccuracy of \u0393 \u03c9 . The uncertainties of the V \u2032 parameters dominate in the \u03c3 \u03c6 , \u03d5 \u03c1 , and \u03d5 \u03c6 systematic errors. The fitted shift of the \u03c9 mass relative to the SND measurement in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 process [9] is consistent with zero. This parameter is allowed to float because its statistical uncertainty of 42 keV is lower than the systematic uncertainty of the \u03c9 mass (90 keV) quoted in Ref. [9]. To understand importance of the V \u2032 contribution, we perform a fit with \u03c3 V \u2032 = 0. The obtained \u03c7 2 value equal to 45.4 corresponds to a significance of 2.1 standard deviations for the V \u2032 contribution. Substituting the fitted cross section \u03c3(s) into Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), we calculate the radiative corrections and the experimental values of the Born cross section. They are listed in Table II. The radiative corrections are also calculated with the different models of the V \u2032 and with the fit parameters varied within their uncertainties. The maximum deviation of a radiative correction from its nominal value is taken as an estimate of its uncertainty. The quoted errors on the Born cross section are statistical and systematic. The latter includes the uncertainties in luminosity, detection efficiency, and radiative correction, as well as the uncertainty associated with inaccuracy in energy setting. The Born cross section measured in this work is shown in Fig. 5 in different energy regions in comparison with the previous most accurate measurements [2][3][4]. The obtained cross section is in reasonable agreement with the previous SND measurements [2,3], but is more precise. Above 0.76 GeV the CMD-2 and our data agrees within the 6% systematic uncertainty [4] for most data points. The exception is the point at 780.5 MeV with about 3\u03c3 deviation from the fitting curve. Below 0.76 GeV there is a systematic difference between our and CMD-2 measurements. ",

The accuracies of the products for the \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons are improved by a factor of about 2 compared with the most precise previous measurement by SND [3]. For the \u03c6 meson, our total uncertainty is about 20%. This is due to a strong correlation between \u03c3 \u03c6 and \u03d5 \u03c6 . Our uncertainty is significantly, by a factor of 2, larger than the uncertainty of previous measurements [2,4]. Since the accuracy of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 cross section measured in this work is better than that of the previous measurements, we conclude that the systematic uncertainty on B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)B(\u03c6 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) was previously underestimated. The phase \u03d5 \u03c1 can be calculated from B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [5] assuming that this decay is fully determined by electromagnetic \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing [21,22]. It is found to be (\u221213.5 \u00b1 0.6) \u2022 and agrees well with our measurement \u03d5 \u03c1 = (\u221212.8\u00b13.5\u00b13.0) \u2022 . It is expected that the phase \u03d5 \u03c6 is close to the same phase measured in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 reaction \u03d5 3\u03c0 \u03c6 = (163\u00b17) \u2022 [9]. Since our result on \u03d5 \u03c6 does not contradict this expectation, we can improve the accuracy of the \u03c6-meson peak cross section by fixing the parameter \u03d5 \u03c6 at the value obtained from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 .

This technique was suggested by the SND Collaboration [24]. The SND result B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)/B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.0994 \u00b1 0.0052 agrees well with Eq. (12) and differs from the KLOE measurement by 1.8\u03c3.

It should be noted that the PDG value is the average of eight measurements, which are in reasonable agreement with each other. The KLOE measurement strongly influences current PDG values of \u03c9 meson parameters. Therefore, we calculate \u03c9 meson parameters based on our measurement B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), the PDG values of B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), and branching fractions of other decays, which sum is equal to 0.0165 \u00b1 0.0013.

Our result for B(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3) is lower than the PDG value by 1.8\u03c3, but agrees with the branching fraction for the charged \u03c1 decay. For the \u03c9, the values of the three directly measured parameters, B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )B(\u03c9 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), and B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)/B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), contradict each other. With our measurement, the level of disagreement between them reaches 3.4\u03c3. The result for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 has an accuracy comparable with that of the PDG value [5]. It has been obtained assuming that the relative phase between the \u03c6 and \u03c9 meson amplitudes is equal to the phase determined in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 process, \u03d5 3\u03c0 \u03c1 = (163 \u00b1 7)",
