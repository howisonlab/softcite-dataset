The K * 0 meson is reconstructed in the final state K + \u03c0 \u2212 , which is required to have an invariant mass within 100 MeV/c 2 of the known K * (892) 0 mass. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 3 fb \u22121 , collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The ratio is measured in two regions of the dilepton invariant mass squared, q 2 , to be R K * 0 = 0.66 + 0.11 \u2212 0.07 (stat) \u00b1 0.03 (syst) for 0.045 < q 2 < 1.1 GeV 2 /c 4 , 0.69 + 0.11 \u2212 0.07 (stat) \u00b1 0.05 (syst) for 1.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 .",

Flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) processes, where a quark changes its flavour without altering its electric charge, provide an ideal laboratory to test LU. The SM forbids FCNCs at tree level and only allows amplitudes involving electroweak loop (penguin and box) Feynman diagrams. The absence of a dominant treelevel SM contribution implies that such transitions are rare, and therefore sensitive to the existence of new particles. The presence of such particles could lead to a sizeable increase or decrease in the rate of particular decays, or change the angular distribution of the final-state particles. Particularly sensitive probes for such effects are ratios of the type [1] ",

Some of the leading-order Feynman diagrams for the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 + \u2212 decays, where represents either a muon or an electron, are shown in figure 1 for both SM and possible New Physics (NP) scenarios. If the NP particles couple differently to electrons and muons, LU could be violated. The K * 0 represents a K * (892) 0 meson, which is reconstructed in the K + \u03c0 \u2212 final state by selecting candidates within 100 MeV/c 2 of the known mass [24]. No attempt is made to separate the K * 0 meson from S-wave or other broad contributions present in the selected K + \u03c0 \u2212 region. The Swave fraction contribution to the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode has been measured by the LHCb collaboration and found to be small [25]. Inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout the paper, unless stated otherwise. The analysis is performed in two regions of q 2 that are sensitive to different NP contributions: a low-q 2 bin, between 0.045 and 1.1 GeV 2 /c 4 , and a central-q 2 bin, between 1.1 and 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 . The lower boundary of the low-q 2 region corresponds roughly to the dimuon kinematic threshold. The boundary at 1.1 GeV 2 /c 4 is chosen such that \u03c6(1020) \u2192 + \u2212 decays, which could potentially dilute NP effects, are included in the low-q 2 interval. The upper boundary of the central-q 2 bin at 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 is chosen to reduce contamination from the radiative tail of the J/\u03c8 resonance.",

The experimental quantities relevant for the measurement are the yields and the reconstruction efficiencies of the four decays entering in the double ratio. Due to the similarity between the experimental efficiencies of the nonresonant and resonant decay modes, many sources of systematic uncertainty are substantially reduced. This helps to mitigate the significant differences in reconstruction between decays with muons or electrons in the final state, mostly due to bremsstrahlung emission and the trigger response. The decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 + \u2212 is measured to be consistent with LU [24]. In order to -2 -JHEP08(2017)055 avoid experimental biases, a blind analysis was performed. The measurement is corrected for final-state radiation (FSR). Recent SM predictions for R K * 0 in the two q 2 regions are reported in table 1. Note that possible uncertainties related to QED corrections are only included in ref. [26], and these are found to be at the percent level. The R K * 0 ratio is smaller than unity in the low-q 2 region due to phase-space effects. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes the LHCb detector, as well as the data and the simulation samples used; the experimental challenges in studying electrons as compared to muons are discussed in section 3; section 4 details how the simulation is adjusted in order to improve the modelling of the data; the selection of the candidates, rejection of the background and extraction of the yields are outlined in sections 5, 6 and 7; section 8 discusses the efficiency determination; the cross-checks performed and the systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement are summarised in sections 9 and 10, respectively; the results are presented in section 11; and section 12 presents the conclusions of the paper.",

Electrons emit a much larger amount of bremsstrahlung which, if not accounted for, would result in a significant degradation of the momentum resolution and consequently in a degradation of the B mass resolution. If the radiation occurs downstream of the dipole magnet, the photon energy is deposited in the same calorimeter cell as that of the lepton, and the momentum of the electron is correctly measured. If the photons are emitted upstream of the magnet, the electron and photon deposit their energy in different calorimeter cells, and the electron momentum is evaluated after bremsstrahlung emission. However, for both types of emissions, the ratio of the energy detected in the ECAL to the momentum measured by the tracking system, an important variable to identify electrons, remains unbiased.",

The bremsstrahlung recovery procedure is limited in three ways: the energy threshold of the clusters that are added; the calorimeter acceptance and resolution; and the presence of energy deposits wrongly interpreted as bremsstrahlung clusters.

The resolution on the reconstructed invariant mass of the B 0 and the background composition depends on the kinematics of the decay, as well as on the trigger category. For this reason, simultaneous fits to the four-body invariant mass of the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 channels are performed separately in the three trigger categories. Following the strategy of ref. [6], the K + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 signal PDF is observed to depend on the number of calorimeter clusters that are added to the dielectron candidate in order to correct for the effects of bremsstrahlung. Three bremsstrahlung categories are considered, depending on whether zero, one or more clusters are recovered. The PDF is described by the sum of a Crystal Ball function [56]   Data Simulation Figure 5. Fraction of (left) B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and (right) B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) candidates (in percent) with zero, one, and two or more recovered clusters per trigger category. The numbers are from (darker colour) data and (lighter colour) simulation. Due to the very low opening angle of the two electrons in B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) decays, the bremsstrahlung photon energy deposits overlap and only one bremsstrahlung cluster at most is resolved. sian function. The shape parameters and the fraction of candidates in each bremsstrahlung category are taken from simulation, the latter having been checked on data control channels (see figure 5). In order to account for possible data-simulation discrepancies, the mean (width) of the PDF for each trigger category is allowed to shift (scale). These shift and scale factors are common between the nonresonant and resonant PDFs. An additional scale factor is also applied to the parameter describing the tail of the CB functions. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function with different slope parameters for the resonant and nonresonant modes, and in each trigger category and q 2 region, that are free to vary in the fit. The shape of the partially reconstructed hadronic background, B \u2192 X(\u2192 Y K * 0 )e + e \u2212 (where the decay product Y is not reconstructed), is obtained from simulation using a sample that includes decays of higher kaon resonances, X, such as K + 1 (1270) and K * + 2 (1430). The mass distribution is modelled using a kernel estimation technique separately in each trigger category and q 2 region. The fraction of this background is free to vary in both q 2 intervals. Due to the requirement on the four-body invariant mass with a J/\u03c8 mass constraint (see section 5), there is no partially reconstructed background left to contaminate B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) candidates. Due to the long radiative tail of the dielectron invariant mass, B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) decays can contaminate the central-q 2 region and an additional background component is considered (see figure 2), however this contribution does not peak at the nominal B 0 mass. The distribution is modelled using simulated events, while the normalisation is constrained using a mixture of data and simulation. The contributions to the resonant modes from \u039b 0 b \u2192 K + pJ/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) decays are treated following the same procedure as for the muon channel. The normalisations are fixed to the yields returned by the muon fit after correcting for efficiency differences between the two final states.   Figure 6.

The K * 0 meson is reconstructed in the final state K + \u03c0 \u2212 , which is required to have an invariant mass within 100 MeV/c 2 of the known K * (892) 0 mass. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, recorded by the LHCb experiment during 2011 and 2012, are used.  Figure 9. Distributions of the R K * 0 delta log-likelihood for the three trigger categories separately and combined.  Table 5. Measured R K * 0 ratios in the two q 2 regions. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. About 50% of the systematic uncertainty is correlated between the two q 2 bins. The 95.4% and 99.7% confidence level (CL) intervals include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties. Figure 10. (Left) Comparison of the LHCb R K * 0 measurements with the SM theoretical predictions: BIP [26] CDHMV [27][28][29], EOS [30][31][32], flav.io [33][34][35] and JC [36]. The predictions are displaced horizontally for presentation. (right) Comparison of the LHCb R K * 0 measurements with previous experimental results from the B factories [4,5]. In the case of the B factories the specific vetoes for charmonium resonances are not represented.",
