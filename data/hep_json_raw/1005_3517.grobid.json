For low energy processes there are no direct predictions from SM and effective theories such as Chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7PT) are used. \u03c7PT gives quantitative predictions for most kaon decay modes. That is why radiative kaon decays provide a testing ground for \u03c7PT. Moreover, these decays are sensitive to New Physics.",

We will initially assume F V and F A constant and then test for their dependence on q 2 .    Experimentally, the decay K \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 \u03b3 was studied mostly in the IB dominated region (see [5], [6], [7]). There was only one formfactor measurement in E787 experiment [8]. In this study, SD + term was extracted and |F V + F A | was obtained to be [9]: F V \u2212 F A = 0.077 \u00b1 0.028. The goal of our study is to measure K \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212\u03bd \u00b5 \u03b3 decay in the kinematic region where INT \u2212 term (and hence F V \u2212 F A ) can be extracted. The experiment was performed at the IHEP 70 GeV proton synchrotron U-70. The experimental setup ISTRA+ ( Fig. 5) was described in details in [10]. The setup was located in the negative unseparated secondary beam. The beam momentum in the measurements was \u223c 26 GeV/c with \u2206p/p \u223c 1.5%. The admixture of K \u2212 in the beam was \u223c 3%. The beam intensity was \u223c 3 \u2022 10 6 per 1.9 sec U-70 spill. The track of a beam particle deflected by M 1 was measured by BP C 1 \u2212 BP C 4 (1mm step multiwire chambers), the kaon identification was done by\u010c 0 \u2212\u010c 2 threshold\u010c-counters. A 9 meter long vacuum decay volume was surrounded by 8 lead glass rings LG 1 \u2212 LG 8 used to veto low energy photons. SP 2 was a lead glass calorimeter to detect/veto large angle photons. Tracks of decay products deflected in M 2 with 1Tm field integral were measured by P C 1 \u2212 P C 3 (2mm step proportional chambers); DC 1 \u2212 DC 3 (1cm cell drift chambers) and finally by 2cm diameter drift tubes DT 1 \u2212 DT 4 . Wide aperture threshold Cerenkov counters\u010c 3 , C 4 were filled with He and were not used in the measurements. Nevertheless\u010c 3 was used as an extension of the decay volume. SP 1 (ECAL) was a 576-cell lead glass calorimeter, followed by HC (HCAL) -a scintillator-iron sampling hadron calorimeter. HC was subdivided into 7 longitudinal sections 7\u00d77 cells each. MH was a 11\u00d711 cell scintillating hodoscope used to improve the time resolution of the tracking system, MuH was a 7\u00d77 cell muon hodoscope.",

Besides that the second group of events has the vertex inside the decay volume filled with He. It could be a possible source of systematics. Repeating the whole procedure (simultaneous fit in x-stripes and final fit) we obtain two values for F V \u2212 F A which are averaged. The obtained values are compatible.
