            "text": "We report the double helicity asymmetry, A J/\u03c8 LL , in inclusive J/\u03c8 production at forward rapidity as a function of transverse momentum pT and rapidity |y|. The data analyzed were taken during \u221a s = 510 GeV longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the 2013 run using the PHENIX detector. At this collision energy, J/\u03c8 particles are predominantly produced through gluon-gluon scatterings, thus A J/\u03c8 LL is sensitive to the gluon polarization inside the proton. We measured A J/\u03c8 LL by detecting the decay daughter muon pairs \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 within the PHENIX muon spectrometers in the rapidity range 1.2 < |y| < 2.2. In this kinematic range, we measured the A J/\u03c8 LL to be 0.012 \u00b1 0.010 (stat) \u00b1 0.003(syst). The A J/\u03c8 LL can be expressed to be proportional to the product of the gluon polarization distributions at two distinct ranges of Bjorken x: one at moderate range x \u2248 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 where recent data of jet and \u03c0 0 double helicity spin asymmetries have shown evidence for significant gluon polarization, and the other one covering the poorly known small-x region x \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Thus our new results could be used to further constrain the gluon polarization for x < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 .",

The total angular momentum of the proton may be decomposed into quark and gluon contributions in several different frameworks [1][2][3][4][5][6]. For example, in the infinite momentum frame, the contributions to the proton spin can be classified according to the Manohar-Jaffe sum rule [1,7,8]:",

The simulation ( Fig. 1) illustrates that for the g + g \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X process in the forward rapidity of the PHENIX muon arm acceptance, the two gluons come from two very distinct x regions, with one gluon in the intermediate x range (3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 -2 \u00d7 10 \u22121 ) and the other gluon in the small x range (1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 -5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). Several sources contribute to the inclusive J/\u03c8 production, including decays from heavier states containing charm and/or bottom quarks. Previous studies in PHENIX [30] at midrapidity indicate that the excited states \u03c7 c and \u03c8 contribute a sizable (30%-40%) portion of the inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross section. The B \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X contribution is only important in the high p T > 10 GeV region, and it is estimated to be small, less than 10% [31] in our kinematics at forward rapidity.",

Because the low mass side band was used to estimate the background spin asymmetry under the J/\u03c8 mass peak, we need to estimate the bias introduced by this approximation. We studied the mass dependence of the background asymmetry by dividing the side band into two mass bins, 1.5 -2.0 GeV/c 2 and 2.0 -2.4 GeV/c 2 . We found no obvious mass-dependence beyond expected statistical fluctuation.
