Parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfer Q 2 (hard ) 1 occur in the early stages of the reaction, in heavy-ion collisions well before the formation of an equilibrated medium. And while in p+p collisions the partons evolve in the QCD-vacuum and fragment directly into jets of observable hadrons, the evolution in heavy-ion collisions is influenced by the presence of a medium with large density of color charges. Thus, scattered partons can lose energy via medium induced gluon radiation or elastic scattering, with the amount of energy loss depending on the color charge and mass of the parton, the traversed path length, and the medium-density 2,3 .",

            "text": "Indeed, already the first hadron measurements in Au+Au reactions at RHIC showed a hadron yield suppressed up to a factor of five and a suppression of jetlike correlation in central collisions 4,5,6,7 . This suppression can be explained by the energy loss of hard scattered partons via induced gluon bremsstrahlung in a medium with high color density, which is also supported by the absence of suppression in the yield of direct photons. 8 Up to date, most measurements of the medium modification of hard scattered partons are based on single particle measurements, which have been used to deduce jet-like properties such as back-to-back correlations, spectral shape/yield and their changes in heavy-ion collisions. This has the disadvantage that the population of each single particle p T -bin is highly biased towards a hard fragmentation. The bias can be largely reduced by reconstruction of full jets, which also allows for a detailed investigation of the expected modification of the jet structure 10 by comparing momentum distributions of particles in jets created in A + A and p+p reactions. However, the measurement of jets in heavy-ion collision is hindered by the presence of a large background and its fluctuation. It recently succeeded for the first time at RHIC energies of \u221a s NN = 200 GeV (see e.g. 9 ), but the potential of full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions for a more quantitative understanding of the medium properties will only be exploited at LHC energies where the increase in jet cross section allows for a better separation of the jet signal from the background in a larger kinematical range. However, for a clear interpretation of all high p T observables in heavy-ion collision a detailed understanding of p+p reactions is essential. The comparison to predictions for the new energy regime reached at the LHC in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, provides an important test of our theoretical understanding of the underlying processes in these elementary collisions. The ALICE detector with its excellent tracking and PID capabilities provides an ideal tool for the studies of jet structure and composition over a large dynamic range from jet transverse momenta of about 100 GeV/c during the first LHC run down to particle p T of 100 MeV/c. 11",

The variety is motivated by the different sensitivity to the background and different background subtraction schemes enabled by the various algorithms 14,15 . For the first period of data taking the jet reconstruction in ALICE is based on the information from reconstructed tracks, i.e. only charged particles. When comparing these reconstructed jets to full particle jets the momentum scale is shifted to lower values by roughly a factor of 0.6 due to the missing neutral energy and the jet resolution is dominated by charged-to-neutral fluctuations in addition to the instrumental momentum resolution. The raw jet spectrum (not corrected for the aforementioned effects) from reconstructed tracks is shown in Fig. 2 for different algorithms with a resolution parameter of R = 0.4 within |\u03b7| < 0.5, the input tracks are taken in the acceptance of |\u03b7| < 0.9. The results from all jet finders agree well in the region above p T = 20 GeV/c, where the effects of seed particles (UA1 cone algorithm) and splitmerge algorithm (SISCone) become negligible, illustrating that in p+p collisions As comparison the input raw track momentum spectrum (|\u03b7| < 0.9) is also shown.

In simulations for central Pb+Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.5 TeV the total amount of background energy is about 200 GeV in an area corresponding to R \u2248 0.4, this can be determined and subtracted on a event-by-event basis. The fluctuations in the background within one event have been estimated with a width of B A i = 12 GeV within the same area 14 . These can be corrected for in the inclusive jet measurement via an unfolding procedure, enabling the comparison of the jet spectra in p+p and Pb+Pb. The expected magnitude and precision of the nuclear modification factor for jets in one nominal year of data taking and including the EMCAL, is shown in Fig. 3 for different values of the medium transport coefficientq. 14 It is clearly seen that jet measurements in ALICE will be sensitive to the change of R jet AA with increasing energy loss. A more discriminative measure, which will help to verify the effect of jet broadening is the ratio of the jet yields obtained with different resolution parameters R. It is also shown in Fig. 3 and illustrates how the energy within the jet is redistributed to larger distances to the jet axis, in this particular model due to modified splitting functions for the parton shower evolution in the medium 16 .
