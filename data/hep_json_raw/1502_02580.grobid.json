            "text": "We present a search for a neutral, long-lived particle L that is produced in e + e \u2212 collisions and decays at a significant distance from the e + e \u2212 interaction point into various flavor combinations of two oppositely charged tracks. The analysis uses an e + e \u2212 data sample with a luminosity of 489.1 fb \u22121 collected by the BABAR detector at the \u03a5 (4S), \u03a5 (3S), and \u03a5 (2S) resonances and just below the \u03a5 (4S). Fitting the two-track mass distribution in search of a signal peak, we do not observe a significant signal, and set 90% confidence level upper limits on the product of the L production cross section, branching fraction, and reconstruction efficiency for six possible two-body L decay modes as a function of the L mass. The efficiency is given for each final state as a function of the mass, lifetime, and transverse momentum of the candidate, allowing application of the upper limits to any production model. In addition, upper limits are provided on the branching fraction B(B \u2192 XsL), where Xs is a strange hadronic system. Recent anomalous astrophysical observations [1][2][3] have generated interest in GeV-scale hidden-sector states that may be long-lived [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Searches for long-lived particles have been performed both in the sub-GeV [13][14][15] and multi-GeV [16][17][18][19][20][21] mass ranges. Dedicated experiments to search for such particles have been proposed [22] or are under construction [23]. However, the O(1 GeV/c 2 ) mass range has remained mostly unexplored, especially in a heavy-flavor environment. B factories offer an ideal laboratory to probe this regime. Previously, the only B-factory results were from a search for a heavy neutralino by the Belle collaboration [24].",

The events are produced with the EvtGen [31] event generator, taking the L spin to be zero. We generate two types of signal MC samples. In the first type, which is used to create the efficiency tables [25] for the model-independent presentation, the L is produced at 11 different masses, m MC = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 9.5 GeV/c 2 . For m MC 0 \u2264 4 GeV/c 2 , the L is created in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 BB, with one B meson decaying to L + N \u03c0 (N = 1, 2, or 3) and the other B decaying generically. At higher masses, the production process is \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 L + N \u03c0. In both cases, the L is produced uniformly throughout the available phase space, with an average transverse decay distance of 20 cm. The events are subsequently reweighted to obtain efficiencies for other decay lengths. Note that these specific processes do not reflect preferred hypotheses about the production mechanism, nor do the results depend on these processes. Rather, they are a convenient method to populate the kinematic range for the efficiency tables.",

The pion misidentification probability is less than 0.01 for the electron PID criteria, less than 0.03 for the muon criteria, and averages at 0.06 for the kaon criteria. A track may have different PID assignments and may appear in multiple pairs. Each track must satisfy d 0 /\u03c3 d0 > 3, where d 0 is the transverse distance of closest approach of the track to the e + e \u2212 interaction point (IP), and \u03c3 d0 is the d 0 uncertainty, calculated from the SVT and DCH hit position uncertainties during the track reconstruction. The two tracks are fit to a common vertex, and the \u03c7 2 value of the fit is required to be smaller than 10 for one degree of freedom. The two-dimensional vector r between the IP and the vertex in the transverse plane must have length r \u2261 | r| in the range 1 < r < 50 cm, and the uncertainty on r is required to satisfy \u03c3 r < 0.2 cm. We require the angle \u03b1 between r and the L-candidate transversemomentum vector to satisfy \u03b1 < 0.01 rad. The uncertainty \u03c3 m on the measured L-candidate mass m must be less than 0.2 GeV/c 2 . The L candidate is discarded if either of the tracks has SVT or DCH hits located between the IP and the vertex, or if the vertex is within the material of the beampipe wall, the DCH support tube, or the DCH inner cylinder. Candidates must satisfy the following decay-mode-specific invariant-mass criteria: 35 GeV/c 2 , and m K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 > 1.05 GeV/c 2 . These criteria reject background from K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays. In addition, other than in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode, they exclude low-mass regions in which the mass distributions of background MC events are not smooth, and therefore incompatible with the background description method outlined below. We require at least one of the tracks of L \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates with m \u2265 8 GeV/c 2 to have an SVT hit. This rejects candidates that decay into \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 within the material of the final-focusing magnets, and thus have poor mass resolution.

The second-highest significance of S = 4.2 occurs at m 0 = 1.24 GeV/c 2 , corresponding to a signal yield of 10 events. To obtain the p-values for these significances, we perform the scans on a large number of m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 spectra generated according to the background PDF, obtained from the data with a finer binning of n = 5. With this choice of n, the generated spectra are not sensitive to fluctuations of the order of the signal resolution (which correspond to n = 1), yet include features that are much smaller than the resolution of the PDF (n = 15). We find that the probability for S \u2265 4.7 (4.2) anywhere in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 spectrum with m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 0.37 GeV/c 2 (m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 > 0.5 GeV/c 2 ) is 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). The p-values are consistent with the naive expectation p(S)w/R, where p(S) is the p-value without the \"look-elsewhere effect\", w is the width of the mass region under study, and R is the average value of R i . We do not include the other modes in the calculation of the p-values. Doing so would naively multiply the p-values by about six. Further study provides strong indication for material-interaction background in the 0.212 GeV/c 2 region. Specifically, most of the 34 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 vertices with m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 0.215 GeV/c 2 occur inside or at the edge of detector-material regions, including 10 of the vertices that also pass the e + e \u2212 selection criteria and 10 that pass the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 criteria. Thus, the peak is consistent with misidentified photon conversions and hadronic interactions close to the mass threshold. We conclude that a significant signal is not observed.",

In region i, the value of the signal PDF for a candidate with hypothesis mass m 0 , measured mass m, and mass resolution uncertainty \u03c3 m isP i S (m) = H i S ((m \u2212 m 0 )/\u03c3 m ), where H i S (x)is the histogram of the mass pull x = (m MC \u2212m MC 0 )/\u03c3 MC m for signal MC events of true mass m MC 0 , measured mass m MC , and m MC uncertainty \u03c3 MC m . This PDF accounts correctly for the large variation in \u03c3 m with r and m. The background PDF P B (m) is obtained from the data, so as not to rely on the background simulation, with the following procedure. First, we create a variablebin-width histogram H D (m) of the data m distribution. The width of a histogram bin, whose lower edge is in m region i, is w i = nR i , where n = 15, and R i is the RMS width of the signal m \u2212 m MC 0 distribution in that region. The value of R i ranges from about 6 MeV/c 2 for m MC 0 = 0.5 GeV/c 2 to 180 MeV/c 2 for m MC 0 GeV/c 2 .",
