The search is optimised for pair production of vector-like top quarks in the Z(\u2192\u03bd\u03bd) t+X decay channel. LHC pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is seen and upper limits on the production crosssection of a vector-like T quark pair as a function of the T quark mass are derived. The observed (expected) 95% CL lower limits on the T mass are 870 GeV (890 GeV) for the weak-isospin singlet model, 1.05 TeV (1.06 TeV) for the weak-isospin doublet model and 1.16 TeV (1.17 TeV) for the pure Zt decay mode. Limits are also set on the mass as a function of the decay branching ratios, excluding large parts of the parameter space for masses below 1 TeV.",

            "text": "A number of theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics address the naturalness problem [1] and offer mechanisms through which the quadratic divergences, which arise from the radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass, are resolved. A straightforward extension of the SM is the inclusion of a heavy fourth generation. However, fourth-generation quarks with SM-like chiral couplings are excluded as they contribute through loops to the couplings of the Higgs boson, altering the Higgs boson production cross-sections to values incompatible with observation [2,3]. These constraints on chiral quarks can be evaded by vector-like quarks (VLQs) [4,5], hypothetical spin-1/2 coloured particles whose left-handed and right-handed states have the same electroweak coupling. Vector-like quarks could dampen the unnaturally large quadratic corrections to the Higgs boson mass by contributing significantly to loop corrections. They appear mainly in the \"Little Higgs\" [6,7] and \"Composite Higgs\" [8] classes of models.",

            "text": "In this analysis, a vector-like top quark partner (T ) with a charge of Q = + 2 /3 |e| is searched for. When assuming couplings to only the third generation of quarks [9], as favoured by their large masses [10], the three possible decay modes are T \u2192 Zt, T \u2192 Ht, and T \u2192 Wb. For T quark masses above about 0.8 TeV the branching ratios converge to B (T \u2192 Wb) 50% and B (T \u2192 Zt) B (T \u2192 Ht) 25% for a weakisospin singlet model and to B (T \u2192 Zt) B (T \u2192 Ht) 50% for a model with a weak-isospin doublet of vector-like quarks. The doublet prediction is valid for a (X 5/3 , T ) doublet, where the superscript refers to the charge of the particle, as well as for a (T, B \u22121/3 ) doublet, as long as the generalised CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix elements fulfil |V T b | |V Bt | [9,11]. In addition to these two models, the case of arbitrary branching ratios of the three possible decay modes is considered.  Vector-like top (VLT) quarks could be produced singly or in pairs at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [12]. This analysis targets the pair production pp \u2192 TT channel, as shown in Figure 1. The production cross-section is predicted to be 0.044 \u00b1 0.005 pb for a T quark mass of 1 TeV, calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) including next-to-next-toleading logarithmic (NNLL) soft-gluon resummation using Top++ 2.0 [13][14][15][16][17][18]. Previous searches for pair-produced vector-like T quarks by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at centre-of-mass energies of 8 TeV [19-22] and 13 TeV [23] set lower limits on the VLT mass in the range of 550-900 GeV, at the 95% confidence level (CL), depending on the branching ratio considered.",

This channel gives rise to a final state with one lepton, multiple jets and a high missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) mainly due to the invisibly decaying Z boson. A single-bin signal region (SR) is defined by an event selection that maximises the sensitivity to this particular channel. Control regions (CRs) and validation regions (VRs) are defined that are enriched in the various background processes. They are orthogonal to the SR and orthogonal to each other. The statistical interpretation is based on a simultaneous fit to the CRs and the SR, in which the background normalisations and a possible signal contribution are determined, while taking into account the experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties.",

During the LHC shutdown between Run 1 and Run 2, a new innermost layer of silicon pixels was added, which improves the track impact parameter resolution and vertex position resolution performance [25,26]. The ID is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, followed by an electromagnetic lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter and a hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter. The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The outer part of the detector consists of a muon spectrometer (MS) with high-precision tracking chambers for coverage up to |\u03b7| = 2.7, fast detectors for triggering over |\u03b7| < 2.4, and three large superconducting toroidal magnets with eight coils each.

Signal samples are generated at leading order (LO) with Protos v2.2 [9,11], interfaced with Pythia 8.186 [29] for the parton shower (PS) and hadronisation. The samples are produced assuming vectorlike T quark couplings according to the weak-isospin singlet model, but with equal branching ratios into each of the three decay modes (Zt, Ht, Wb). Desired branching ratios are obtained by reweighting the samples based on generator information. To test potential kinematic biases from the assumed couplings, a comparison to a sample in which the T quark is in a weak-isospin doublet was carried out. For a T quark mass of 950 GeV a relative acceptance increase of 10% is observed in the doublet case. This effect is neglected in the analysis and results in slightly more conservative limits for the doublet model. For the background samples, several matrix element event generators are combined with parton shower and hadronisation programs. Powheg-Box v2 [30][31][32][33] interfaced to Pythia v6.428 [34] is used to simulate tt production as well as single-top production in association with a W boson, while electroweak t-channel single-top quark events are generated using the Powheg-Box v1 generator. Events containing W bosons with associated jets (W+jets) are simulated using the Sherpa v2.2.0 event generator [35][36][37], while for diboson events Sherpa v2.1.1 is used. For the simulation of tt events with additional vector bosons (tt +V) the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.3.2 [38] event generator interfaced with Pythia 8 is used.",

The samples produced with Protos, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg-Box use EvtGen v1.2.0 [43] for the modelling of b-hadron decays. All simulated samples are processed with the full simulation of the ATLAS detector [44] using Geant 4 [45], and with varying numbers of simulated minimum-bias interactions generated with Pythia 8 overlaid on the hard-scattering event to account for the multiple pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pile-up). The average number of interactions per bunch crossing in simulation matches the distribution in data. Additional details of the simulation set-up can be found in Refs. [46][47][48][49].",

The am T2 variable is used to suppress dileptonic tt events where one lepton goes undetected. Thus, the sets of visible particles for the am T2 are combinations of the identified lepton and the two jets with the highest b-tagging weights, where the lepton is combined with either jet and the combination with the lowest resulting am T2 is taken.

This benchmark signal was chosen due to its mass being at the expected sensitivity reach of this analysis, and its high branching ratio into the required Zt decay mode, while at the same time allowing for decays into other final states. A summary of the SR selection is given in Table 1. Due to the invisible decay of the Z boson, a high-E miss T requirement of at least 350 GeV is set. As discussed above, the m W T and am T2 variables are used to reduce the tt and W+jets backgrounds. The properties of large-radius jets are used to exploit the structure of the high-mass VLT decay. At least two large-radius jets with high p T and large mass are required. These target a hadronically decaying top quark, or the subsequent hadronic W boson decay, as well as a second, hadronically decaying massive boson. At very high E miss T the backgrounds are sufficiently reduced to allow looser requirements on the large-radius jet p T . For the benchmark signal, 13.4 \u00b1 0.5 events are expected in the SR, with 95% of them containing an invisibly decaying Z boson. This number decreases to 75% for the singlet model with a T quark mass of 1 TeV, where B (T \u2192 Zt) 25%. The efficiency of the full event selection for the benchmark signal is 1%, taking all decay modes into account.

The uncertainties are not constrained further in the fits as the analysis has as many bins as free parameters. The uncertainties in the tt and W+jets backgrounds in the SR result from the relative difference of each systematic source in the SR to the respective CR due to the normalisation in the fit. In general the systematic uncertainties are smaller than the statistical uncertainties.    Dominant experimental uncertainties come from imperfect knowledge of the scale and resolution of both jet energies and masses as well as the modelling of the b-tagging efficiency for b-jets, c-jets and lightflavour jets. The jet energy scale uncertainty is split into three components [69]. The relative uncertainty in the estimated background yields in the SR from these sources is 1%-5%. In addition, the uncertainty in the mass scale and the resolution of the small-radius jets is considered. It has a small effect on the background, but affects the signal because hadronically decaying Z and W bosons can be reconstructed as a single small-radius jet. Additional small experimental uncertainties are due to the scale and resolution of the E miss T soft-term, which captures all tracks not associated with calibrated objects in the event, the modelling of lepton-related quantities, the trigger efficiency, as well as the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity and the pile-up profile.",

Comparing the cross-section limits to the theoretical expectation, lower limits on the T quark mass can be derived. The limits are summarised in Table 4: Number of events observed in the signal, control and validation regions, together with the estimated SM backgrounds. The normalisation factors determined in the simultaneous fit are applied. The uncertainties include all statistical and systematic sources. The individual uncertainties are correlated, and do not necessarily add in quadrature to the total background uncertainty.     Table 5. The sensitivity to the singlet model is lower due to the low B (T \u2192 Zt), which approaches 25% in the high-mass limit. Figure 7 shows the 95% CL observed and expected lower limits on the signal mass as a function of the decay branching ratios. The highest sensitivity is found in the region of B (T \u2192 Zt) 100%. The sensitivity to the mixed ZtHt decay mode is larger than to the ZtWb decay mode. As an example, masses of m T < 1 TeV are excluded for B (T \u2192 Ht) < 65% (70% expected) in the former decay mode and for B (T \u2192 Wb) < 45% (50% expected) in the latter.
