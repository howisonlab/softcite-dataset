QCD-motivated models for hadrons predict an assortment of \"Exotic Hadrons\" that have structures that are more complex than the quark-antiquark mesons and three-quark baryons of the original quark model, such as glueballs, hybrids and multi-quark states. Experimental search of these predictions and subsequent investigation of their properties would provide validation of and valuable input to the quantitative understanding of QCD.",

More recently, data were taken in the energy region above 4 GeV, where energies up to about 4.6 GeV are accessible.

            "text": "Recently, in the study of e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , a distinct charged structure, named the Z c (3900) \u00b1 , was observed in the J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u00b1 spectrum by BESIII [4] and Belle [5]. Its existence was confirmed shortly thereafter with CLEO-c data [6]. The existence of the neutral partner in the decay Z c (3900) 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 has also been reported in CLEO-c data [6] and by BESIII [7], thus complementing the isospin-triplet representation of isospin one, I = 1, resonances. The Z c (3900) is a good candidate for an exotic state beyond simple quark models, since it contains a cc pair and is also electrically charged. Noting that the Z c (3900) has a mass very close to the D * D threshold (3875 MeV), BESIII analyzed the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 (DD * ) \u2213 , and a clear structure in the (DD * ) \u2213 mass spectrum is seen, called the Z c (3885). The measured mass and width are (3883.9 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 4.2) MeV/c 2 and (24.8 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 11.0) MeV, respectively, and quantum numbers J P = 1 + are favored [8]. A neutral structure in the DD * system around the DD * mass threshold is observed with a statistical significance greater than 10\u03c3 in the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + D * \u2212 \u03c0 0 + c.c. and e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0D * 0 \u03c0 0 + c.c. at \u221a s = 4.226 and 4.257 GeV in the BESIII experiment [10]. Assuming the Z c (3885) \u2192 DD * and the Z c (3900) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 signals are from the same source, the ratio of partial widths \u0393(Z c (3885)\u2192DD * ) \u0393(Z c (3900)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0) is determined to be 6.2\u00b11.1\u00b12.7. This ratio is much smaller than typical values for decays of conventional charmonium states above the open charm threshold. BESIII also searched for the decay mode of Z c with the annihilation of cc in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [9]. The upper limits of the Born cross section are determined to be 0.26 and 0.18 pb, at E CM = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV, respectively. Figure 1 shows the Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 and its isospin-partner, Z c (3900) 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8. The results of Z c (3885) \u2192 (DD *  ) observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0(DD * ) processes are shown in Fig. 2.  [11]. Corresponding \u03c0 \u00b1 h c invariant mass distribution, when all energy points are combined, is shown in Fig. 3. The Z c (4020) \u00b1 signal has 8.9\u03c3 significance. And the inset represents a search for the Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c0h c , at E CM = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV. At the 90% confidence level (C.L.), the upper limits on the production cross-sections are set to \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 Z c (4020) \u2213 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c ) < 13 pb at 4.23 GeV and < 11 pb at 4.26 GeV. These are lower than those of Z c (4020) \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 [4] A structure that couples to D * D * is evident, in both charged and neutral decays, denoted as Z c (4025). Fig. 4 shows the results of Z c (4025). Assuming the Z c (4020) and the Z c (4025) signals are from the same source, the ratio of partial widths \u0393(Z c (4025)\u2192D * D * ) \u0393(Z c (4020)\u2192h c \u03c0) is determined to be 12 \u00b1 5.

The products of the Born cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 X(3823) and the branching ratio B[X(3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1,c2 ] are also measured. These measurements are in good agreement with the assignment of the X(3823) as the \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) charmonium state. The fitted results to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 recoil mass distributions for events in the \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 signal regions are shown in The production cross-sections of \u03c3 B (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 X(3823)) \u2022 B(X(3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 , \u03b3\u03c7 c2 ) were also measured at these c.m. energies.

In addition, an enhancement in the invariant pp mass at threshold, X(pp), was first observed by BESII in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp [27], and was later also seen by BESIII [28] and CLEO [29]. In a partial wave analysis(PWA), BESIII determined the J PC of the X(pp) to be 0 \u2212+ [30]. The mass of the X((pp) is consistent with X(1835), but the width of the X(pp) is significantly narrower. To understand the nature of the X(1835), it is crucial to measure its J PC and to search for new decay modes. Fig. ?? (a) shows the scatter plot of the invariant mass of K 0 S K 0 S versus that of K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7, indicating the structure around 1.85 GeV/c 2 is strongly correlated with f 0 (980). A partial wave analysis (PWA) of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 has been performed in the mass range [31]. Fig. 8 (b) and (c) are the invariant mass distributions of K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7, K 0 S K 0 S . Overlaid on the data are the PWA fit projections, as well as the individual contributions from each component. The PWA fit requires a contribution from X(1835) \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 with a statistical significance greater than 12.9\u03c3, where the X(1835) \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 is dominated by f 0 (980) production. The spin parity of the X(1835) is determined to be 0 \u2212+ . The mass and width of the X(1835) are measured to be 1844 \u00b1 9(stat) +16 \u221225 (syst) MeV/c 2 and 192 +20 \u221217 (stat) +62 \u221243 (syst) MeV, respectively. The corresponding product branching fraction B X(1835) is measured to be (3.31 +0.33 \u22120.30 (stat) +1.96 \u22121.29 (syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . The mass and width of the X(1835) are consistent with the values obtained from the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by BESIII [26]. These results are all first-time measurements and provide important information to further understand the nature of the X(1835). Another 0 \u2212+ state, the X(1560), also is observed in data with a statistical significance larger than 8.9\u03c3. The mass and width of the X(1560) are consistent with those of the \u03b7(1405) and \u03b7(1475) as given in Ref. [32] within 2.0\u03c3 and 1.4\u03c3, respectively.  Amplitude analysis of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system produced in radiative J/\u03c8 decays A mass independent amplitude analysis of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system in radiative J/\u03c8 decays is performed [33]. This analysis uses the world's largest data sample of its type, collected with the BESIII detector, to extract a piecewise function that describes the scalar and tensor \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes in this decay. While the analysis strategy employed to obtain results has complications, namely ambiguous solutions, a large number of parameters, and potential bias in subsequent analyses from non-Gaussian effects, it minimizes systematic bias arising from assumptions about \u03c0\u03c0 dynamics, and, consequently, permits the development of dynamical models or parameterizations for the data. The intensities and phase differences for the amplitudes in the fit are presented as a function of M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 in Ref. [33]. Additionally, in order to facilitate the development of models, the intensities and phases for each bin of M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 are given in supplemental materials of Ref. [33]. These results may be combined with those of similar reactions for a more comprehensive study of the light scalar meson spectrum. Finally, the branching fraction of radiative J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is measured to be (1.15 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where the error is systematic only and the statistical error is negligible. This is the first measurement of this branching fraction.",

Recently, the production rate of the pure gauge tensor glueball in J/\u03c8 radiative decays has been predicted by Lattice QCD [38], which is compatible with the large production rate of the f 2 (2340) in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6\u03c6 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 [39].
