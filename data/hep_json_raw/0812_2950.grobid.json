            "text": "Hard scattering processes play an important role in the understanding of the quark and gluon structure of hadrons. The important feature of hard reactions is the possibility of separating the perturbative (short distance) and nonperturbative (long distance) parts of the interaction. This so-called factorization property has been successfully used in inclusive measurements [e.g., in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of leptons] to study the internal structure of the nucleon. Until recently, very few exclusive processes could be treated in the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD) and compared to experimental data (typical examples are the \u03c0 0 \u03b3 \u03b3 * transition form factor [1] and the elastic form factors of the pion [2] and the nucleon [3]). The recently developed formalism of a QCD description of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) [4,5] and deeply exclusive meson production [6] provides a framework in which the amplitudes of these processes can be factorized into a hard-scattering part (exactly calculable in pQCD) and a nonperturbative nucleon structure part that can be parametrized at the amplitude level by means of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The GPDs contain information on quark/antiquark correlations, particularly the correlation of their transverse spatial and longitudinal momentum distributions, and on the quark angular momentum [7]. They provide a unifying picture for an entire set of fundamental quantities containing information on the hadronic structure, such as nucleon form factors (which are related to matrix elements of vector and axial vector currents), polarized and unpolarized parton distributions, and contributions to the spin of the nucleon due to orbital excitations of quarks and gluons.",

The Q 2 dependence of the helicity-dependent and helicity-independent cross sections was measured by the Hall A Collaboration at Jefferson Lab [17]. The beam charge asymmetry [18] and transverse targetspin asymmetry [19] have also been reported by the HERMES Collaboration. Recently, the CLAS Collaboration published measurements of the DVCS beam spin asymmetry over a wide kinematical range using high statistics data obtained with a 5.77 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam [20]. In this paper, new results on the beam spin asymmetry in DVCS at 4.8 GeV using the CLAS detector are presented. Measuring the same observables at the same (x B , Q 2 , t) but different energies will yield different combinations of the terms of interest and thus contribute to the determination of GPDs. In this analysis, the number of single photon events has been extracted using the method developed in Ref. [14]. A fit to the line shape of the missing mass squared distributions in the reaction ep \u2192 epX was employed in each kinematical bin.

In Fig. 2, the distribution of the number of photoelectrons detected in the CC, N p.e. , vs the ratio E EC /P is shown after the fiducial cuts have been applied. Here E EC is the electromagnetic shower energy detected in the EC and P is the momentum of the particle reconstructed in the DC. The lower horizontal band corresponds to negative pions.

In the graph for the Q 2 dependence, the previously published CLAS result on \u03b1 [14] is shown by an open cross. The solid and dashed-dotted lines are the Q 2 and t dependences of the sin \u03c6 p\u03b3 moments of the beam spin asymmetry calculated using a Regge trajectory exchange model for the interaction of the photon with the proton [23,24] using two treatments of the unitarity cuts. The dashed-dotted curves retain the contribution of the poles [23]   and the contribution of the \u03c1-p elastic cut [24]. They take into account the coupling between the \u03b3 -p and the \u03c1-p channels and are well under control since they rely on known on-shell matrix elements. The solid curves also take into account all of the inelastic diffractive cuts, under the assumption that diffractive dissociation saturates the photoabsorption cross section. This treatment leads to an excellent agreement with the unpolarized cross sections, as well as the helicity difference of the DVCS cross sections, recently measured in Hall A [17]. The other two curves in the graphs represent calculations of the sin \u03c6 p\u03b3 moments with a GPD-based model [25], using a Regge ansatz for the t distribution of the GPD [26]. The parametrization of GPDs includes the D term (to ensure the polynomiality of Mellin moments of GPDs [27]). Helicitydependent cross sections were calculated at the twist-3 level and include target mass corrections [25]. Calculations are done for two different skewedness parameter values for sea quarks, b sea = 1 (dashed line) and b sea = 2 (dotted line). In the calculations, the profile parameter for the valence quark was b val = 1 and the Regge slope parameter \u03b1 = 1.05 [26]. The data favor the GPD model with the sea quark skewedness parameter b sea = 2. The calculations include the DVCS contributions to both the numerator [Eq. (13)] and denominator [Eq. (12)] of A LU .",

The Q 2 and t dependences of the sin \u03c6 p\u03b3 moment are compared with theoretical calculations using the GPD-based model for DVCS [25,29] and the photon-proton interaction based on a Regge model [24]. The sensitivity of our results is not good enough to estimate small contributions from higher twists and the powersuppressed terms. However, the data put constraints on the model parameters used to calculate the beam spin asymmetry. Also, the data are reproduced by a model based on Regge poles and unitary cuts. Whether this is a consequence of the quark hadron duality remains to be investigated. Clearly, more data in a wide range of kinematics are needed to refine the parameters of the models. New experiments on DVCS and on deeply virtual meson production will provide further observables in the deeply exclusive production regime that can be used in a global fit to extract the GPDs.",
