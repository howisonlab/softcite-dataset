The Belle II program is based on the success of the BaBar and Belle experiments, which discovered and established [2] violation of charge-parity symmetry (CP) in B meson dynamics. The agreement with the expectations of the Standard Model of measurements related to CP violation (CPV) is limited to an accuracy of 10%-20%. Further studies of CP violation are therefore essential to over-constrain the dynamics in search for deviations from the Standard Model (SM). Belle II is complementary to the LHC experiments. If LHC experiments will find evidence of non-SM physics, precision flavour inputs might likely be essential to characterise in more detail the novel dynamics. If no evidence for non-SM physics is found at LHC, the large samples collected by Belle II will provide a powerful indirect probe for new physics beyond the TeV scale. Belle II and LHCb are largely complementary. LHCb collects large samples of both B 0 s and B mesons and will dominate measurements based on final states with charged particles. Belle II is expected to lead in B measurements of final states with neutrinos, or multiple photons. Belle II data taking will start at the beginning of 2019; the sample size equivalent to that of Belle will be reached in a few months, and in a couple of years it will reach 5 ab \u22121 . A data sample of 50 ab \u22121 is expected to be collected within 7 years.",

All this required substantial modifications of the trigger, data acquisition and offline computing system with respect to Belle. In addition many components of the Belle II detector have been upgraded or completely rebuilt ( Fig. 1). Belle II features an entirely novel tracking, consisting of a pixel vertex detector, a silicon strip vertex detector, a central drift chamber, and new particle identification systems as well as a faster signal processing in the outer detectors.

The new vertex detector system, thanks to the reduced radius of the new Berillium beam pipe made possible by superKEKB nano beam scheme, has its first layer located at \u21e012 mm radius from the interaction point and provides an impact parameter resolution of \u21e020\u00b5m. Recently a complete wedge of the PXD and SVD detectors has been assembled and exposed to a test beam at DESY, Hamburg, with all the final read out components and data acquisition chain in place. The test was very successful, in particular a major milestone was reached with the positive test of the Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm running online; this is needed to reduce the data trasfer bandwidth by identifying and reading out only the pixel that are found to be associated to SVD tracks extrapolated back to the PXD detector planes. In Fig. 3.1 we show a picture of the PXD and SVD assembly on the test beam line. The vertex detector system is on schedule to be installed on the Belle II detector during the summer of 2018, after the second commissioning phase starting in January 2018.",

Many sources of systematic uncertainties are expected in the wrong-tag fractions, possible fit biases, signal fractions, the background \u2206t distribution, B meson lifetime and mass difference. All depend on the simulated sample sizes and are therefore expected to be reducible. Two remaining irreducible uncertainties need a dedicated study, the tag side interference and the uncertainty due to the vertex reconstruction algorithm. Table 1 shows the expected results in 50 ab \u22121 [10]. They are expected to be dominated by systematic uncertainties. Three scenarios are considered, 'no improvement', where no improvements are assumed over the Belle irreducible systematic uncertainties; 'vertex improvement', where an improvement of 50% is assumed for the systematic uncertainty due to the vertex positions; and 'leptonic categories', where the analysis uses only leptonic categories for flavour tagging. A precision better than 1% is expected when combining all the b \u2192 ccs modes with the full Belle II data set. The decay-time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters S can be also measured in charmless decays to CP eigenstates governed by the b \u2192 sqq quark transition. These decays are particularly sensitive to non-SM physics because any unobserved heavy particle with compatible quantum numbers could contribute an additional penguin loop and alter the value of the observed weak phase. A significant deviation of the measured value of S in one or more charmless decays from the value from tree-dominated processes could indicate non-SM physics. Belle II performed a sensitivity study for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 and B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 K 0 modes. Both the BaBar and Belle experiments extracted the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 CP asymmetry parameters from the time-dependent analysis of the K + K \u2212 K 0 final state [5,6]. The Belle II decay-time-dependent study considers four benchmark final states in a quasi-two body approach, \u03c6(K Table 2 lists the expected sensitivity estimated for an integrated luminosity of 5 ab \u22121 .

Currently the |V ub | measurement is limited by the precision of the form factor calculated by lattice QCD and light-cone sum rules [7]. Two techniques for the measurement of the differential branching fraction exist, using high-purity hadronic B tag reconstruction [8], and low-purity untagged measurements [9]. In the tagged measurement, the B companion is fully reconstructed in one of the many hadronic decay modes. Then the rest of the event is required to be consistent with the signature of the signal decay (only two additional opposite charged particles, one being consistent with the pion and one with the lepton hypothesis). In untagged measurements, the signal B candidate is reconstructed by selecting quality pion and lepton candidates originating from the same space-point. As the Belle II detector covers hermetically a large portion of the full solid angle, we assume that all remaining tracks and clusters of the rest of the event came from the companion B meson, B comp . The B comp is then reconstructed by summing the four-momenta of the hypothetical particles from the remaining tracks and clusters. The precise measurement of the B comp momentum in the tagged analysis implies an improved determination of q 2 compared to the untagged measurement. The simulated reconstruction efficiency is 0.55%, which is considerably above the reconstruction efficiency (0.3%) of the tagged measurement reported by Belle. The expected precision of the exclusive |V ub | determination from the untagged (tagged) analysis is 1.7% (1.3%) on the 50 ab \u22121 data set assuming the expected factor of 5 improvement in the progress in lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations over the next decade.",

The Belle inclusive analysis shows significant systematic uncertainties related to modelling of the charmless semileptonic decay composition. These uncertainties might be reduced with more data through a better characterisation of B \u2192 X u l\u03bd in hadron-tagged samples. The background from B \u2192 X c l\u03bd decays, which is 50 times larger than the signal, makes the extraction of |V ub | from the inclusive measurement very challenging. For this measurement, kinematic selection criteria have to be applied to suppress B \u2192 X c l\u03bd decays, and |V ub | is extracted from the differential B \u2192 X u l\u03bd rate in various phase space regions. The full data sample at Belle II is expected to allow for more a precise characterisation of high mass B \u2192 X c l\u03bd modes, with more accurate background subtraction in low purity, high mass regions. Moreover the Belle II large data set is expected to allow precise, unfolded measurements of the kinematic spectra in B \u2192 X u l\u03bd decays. That will give important information about shape functions, weak annihilation and signal modelling, thus testing their validity. A projection to the first 5 ab \u22121 of Belle II data with two single differential spectra in the invariant mass of the hadronic part of the decay, and the lepton energy of B \u2192 X u l\u03bd, shows a factor 2 of improvement over current results.",

The plan is to reach five-fold the Belle sample size in a couple of years and a further factor of ten is expected to be collected within the subsequent five years. The large data set, together with substantial improvements in the detector, are expected to allow for significant improvements in many measurement of CKM parameters. The existing constraints, in fact, do not exclude the possibility of sizeable contributions from non-SM processes in various flavour physics observables that can be tested in the next few years. The parameter sin(2\u03c6 1 ) is expected to reach 1% a precision, remaining the most precise input associated with the Unitarity Triangle. The parameter sin(2\u03c6 2 ) will benefit from the inclusion of additional and improved isospin analysis inputs that will reduce ambiguities in the \u03c6 2 solution. The \u03c6 3 precision is expected to reach 1.6 \u2022 . |V ub | will be measured with a precision up to 1.3%(3%) in exclusive (inclusive) semileptonic measurements. Thanks to these and many other results, Belle II will drive a significant advance in our knowledge the quark flavour dynamics.",
