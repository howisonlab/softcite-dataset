The measurements are performed with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb \u22121 using the CMS detector at the LHC. The cross sections are measured differentially as a function of the kinematic properties of the leptons, jets from bottom quark hadronization, top quarks, and top quark pairs at the particle and parton levels. The results are compared to several Monte Carlo generators that implement calculations up to next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics interfaced with parton showering, and also to fixed-order theoretical calculations of top quark pair production up to next-to-next-to-leading order.",

            "text": "The measurement of tt differential cross sections can provide a test of perturbative quantum chromodynamic (QCD) calculations and also improve the knowledge of parton distribution functions (PDFs) [1]. Previous measurements of differential cross sections for tt production have been performed in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC at center-of-mass energies of 7 [2,3] and 8 TeV [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. The dilepton (electron or muon) final state of the tt decay helps in the suppression of background events. This paper presents the first CMS measurement at \u221a s = 13 TeV in the dilepton decay final state and includes the same-flavor lepton channels (e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb \u22121 . The statistical precision of the measurements is improved by the increased data sample from including the same-flavor lepton channels. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015, and this measurement complements other recent JHEP04 (2018)060measurements that have been reported in a different decay channel [13] and by a different experiment [14,15].",

Particle-level measurements use final-state kinematic observables that are experimentally measurable and theoretically well defined. Corrections are limited mainly to detector effects that can be determined experimentally. The particle-level measurements are designed to have minimal model dependencies. The visible differential cross section is defined for a phase space within the acceptance of the experiment. Large extrapolations into inaccessible phase-space regions are thus avoided in particle-level differential cross section measurements. In contrast, the parton-level measurement of the top quark pair production cross sections is performed in the full phase space. This facilitates comparisons to predictions in perturbative QCD.",

The cross sections as a function of the invariant mass and rapidity of the tt system are also measured to help in understanding the PDFs. The angular difference in the transverse plane between the top and anti-top quarks is provided to compare to predictions of new physics beyond the standard model [16].

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [17]. The particle-flow (PF) algorithm [18] is used to reconstruct objects in the event, combining information from all the CMS subdetectors. The missing transverse momentum vector ( p miss T ) is defined as the projection onto the plane perpendicular to the beam axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF candidates in an event [19]. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T .",

Events are selected using dilepton triggers with asymmetric p T thresholds. The low transverse momentum (p T ) threshold is 8 GeV for the muon and 12 GeV for the electron, and the high-p T threshold is 17 GeV for both muon and electron. The trigger efficiency is measured in data using triggers based on p miss T [40]. The reconstructed and selected muons [41] and electrons [42] are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Since the primary leptons that originated from top quark decays are expected to be isolated, an isolation criterion is placed on each lepton to reduce the rate of secondary leptons from non-top hadronic decays. A relative isolation parameter is used, which is calculated as the sum of the p T of charged and neutral hadrons and photons in a cone of angular radius \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 ) around the direction of the lepton, divided by the lepton p T , where \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206\u03b7 are the azimuthal and pseudorapidity differences, respectively, between the directions of the lepton and the other particle. Any mismodeling of the lepton selection in the simulation is accounted for by applying corrections derived using a \"tag-and-probe\" technique based on control regions in data [43]. Jets are reconstructed using PF candidates as inputs to the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm [44,45], with \u2206R = 0.4. The momenta of jets are corrected to account for effects from pileup, as well as nonuniformity and nonlinearity of the detector. For the data, energy corrections are also applied to correct the detector response [46]. We select jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 that pass identification criteria designed to reject noise in the calorimeters.",

The number of iterations is optimized for each distribution, using simulation to find the minimum number of iterations that reduces the bias to a negligible level.

The differential cross sections are measured as a function of several kinematic variables at particle level in a visible phase space corresponding to the detector acceptance and at parton level in the full phase space. The measurements are compared to the predictions from Monte Carlo simulations and calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. In general, the measurements are in fairly good agreement with predictions. We confirm that the top quark p T spectrum in data is softer than the Monte Carlo predictions at both particle and parton levels, as reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The present results are in agreement with the earlier ATLAS and CMS measurements. We also find that the measurements are in better agreement with calculations within quantum chromodynamics up to next-to-next-to-leadingorder accuracy at the parton level compared to previous next-to-leading-order predictions.

Normalized differential tt cross sections as a function of p tt T (upper left), y tt (upper right), and M tt (lower) for the top quarks or antiquarks, measured at parton level in the full phase space. The vertical bars on the data points indicate the total (combined statistical and systematic) uncertainties, while the hatched band shows the statistical uncertainty. The measurements are compared to different perturbative QCD calculations of an improved NLO+NNLL (NLO+NNLL') [65] and a full NNLO [66]. The lower panel gives the ratio of the theoretical predictions to the data.",
