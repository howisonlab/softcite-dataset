The present analysis is based on a total sample of 1995 events of CNGS neutrino interactions, which corresponds to an almost doubled sample of the previously published result. Four clear \u03bd e events have been visually identified over the full sample, compared with an expectation of 6.4 \u00b1 0.9 events from conventional sources. The result is compatible with the absence of additional anomalous contributions. At 90% and 99% confidence levels, the limits to possible oscillated events are 3.7 and 8.3 respectively. The corresponding limit to oscillation probability becomes consequently 3.4 x 10 -3 and 7.6 x 10 -3 respectively. The present result confirms, with an improved sensitivity, the early result already published by the ICARUS Collaboration.",

The event reconstruction is based on the signals recorded by the three TPC wire planes [2,10] at angles 60\u00b0 apart. After hit finding and fitting, the energy deposition is computed in the charge collecting view. A correction is introduced based on the (small) electron signal attenuation due to the drift distance directly measured with the help of cosmic ray muons. The high density of sampling -corresponding to ~ 2% of a radiation lengthand the remarkable signal/noise ratio of about 10/1 allow to measure the specific ionisation of each wire. It is also possible to perform precise calorimetry and particle identification for stopping particles [10] and obtain a powerful electron/\u03b3 separation [4]. The total visible energy of the events has been determined from the total charge collected by the TPC wires, corrected for the electronic response [2] and for the dE/dx recombination of the signals in LAr [11].",

[6]. The conversion has been extracted directly from the above graph of Ref. [6], converting the ratio of the excess events/MeV to the oscillation probability using their (also plotted) example of the two neutrino model case with sin 2 2\u03b8 ( ) = 0. The result is shown in Figure 4. There is tension between the limit sin 2 (2\u03b8 new ) < 6.8\u00d710 -3 at 90% CL and < 1.52\u00d710 -2 at 99% CL of the present experiment and the neutrino lowest energy points of MiniBooNE with 200 < E \u03bd QE < 475 MeV, suggesting an instrumental or otherwise unexplained nature of the low energy signal reported by Ref. [6]. Recently a similar search performed at the same CNGS beam by the OPERA experiment has confirmed our finding and the absence of anomalous oscillations with an independent limit sin 2 (2\u03b8 new ) < 7.2\u00d710 -3 [19].",

Figure 2 in Ref. [6] has been used in order to convert the observed number of excess events/MeV to their corresponding oscillation probabilities. In order to perform the conversion, the values sin 2 2\u03b8 ( ) = 0.2 and \u0394m 41 2 = 0.1 eV 2 from Figure 2 of Ref. [6] have been used. The resulting oscillation probability distribution for neutrino and for E \u03bd > 475 MeV (square red points) appears incompatible with the antineutrino LNSD effect. In the 200 < E \u03bd QE < 475 MeV region (triangular red points) -below the sensitive E \u03bd L region of LSND -the new MiniBooNE effect is widely incompatible with the averaged upper probability limits to anomalies from the present paper and from OPERA [19] in their E \u03bd L regions. An extrapolation from ICARUS (black curves marked as 1, 2 and 3) to larger values of E/L for two-neutrino oscillation parameters simultaneously compatible with LSND, MiniBooNe and Karmen is also shown as guidance.",
