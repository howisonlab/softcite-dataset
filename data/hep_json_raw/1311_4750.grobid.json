When combining the result with the current best knowledge of oscillation parameters including the world average value of \u03b8 13 from reactor experiments, some values of \u03b4 CP are disfavored at the 90% C.L. DOI Introduction.-The discovery of neutrino oscillations using atmospheric neutrinos was made by Super-Kamiokande in 1998 [1]. Since then, many other experiments have confirmed the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations through various disappearance modes of flavor transformations. However, to date, there has not been an observation of the explicit appearance of a different neutrino flavor from neutrinos of another flavor through neutrino oscillations. In 2011, the T2K collaboration published the first indication of electron neutrino appearance from a muon neutrino beam at 2.5\u03c3 significance based on a data set corresponding to 1.43 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target (POT) [2,3]. This result was followed by the publication of further evidence for electron neutrino appearance at 3.1\u03c3 in early 2013 [4]. This Letter presents new results from the T2K experiment that establish, at greater than 5\u03c3, the observation of electron-neutrino appearance from a muon-neutrino beam.",

The measurement of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations is of particular interest because this mode is sensitive to both \u03b8 13 and \u03b4 CP . The first indication of nonzero \u03b8 13 was published by T2K [3] based on the measurement of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations. More recently, indications of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations were also reported by the MINOS experiment [8]. The value of \u03b8 13 is now precisely known to be 9.1\u00b0AE 0.6\u00b0from measurements of\u03bd e disappearance in reactor neutrino experiments [9][10][11][12]. Using the reactor measurement of \u03b8 13 , the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e appearance mode can be used to explore CP violation, which has yet to be observed in the lepton sector. CP violation, as shown in Eq. 1, is governed by the second term and can be as large as 27% of the first term for the T2K experimental setup when using current values of the neutrino oscillation parameters. T2K experiment.-T2K operates at the J-PARC facility in Tokai, Japan. A muon neutrino beam is produced from the decay of charged pions and kaons generated by 30 GeV protons hitting a graphite target and focused by three magnetic horns. Downstream of the horns is the decay volume, 96 meters in length, followed by the beam dump and muon monitors (MUMON). The neutrino beam illuminates an on-axis detector and off-axis detectors positioned at an angle of 2.5\u00b0relative to the beam direction. The resulting energy spectrum, peaked at 0.6 GeV for the off-axis detectors, reduces the \u03bd e contamination and the feed-down backgrounds to the \u03bd e appearance signal from higher energy neutrinos. The near detector complex at 280 meters from the target is used to measure the neutrino beam direction, spectrum, and composition before oscillations and to measure neutrino cross sections. The complex consists of an on-axis detector (INGRID) and a suite of off-axis detectors (ND280) that reside within a 0.2 T magnet [2]. The Super-Kamiokande (SK) 50 kt water Cherenkov detector, situated 295 km away, is used to detect the oscillated neutrinos.",

Also in this category are normalizations for other CC and NC cross sections, the \u03bd e =\u03bd \u03bc CC cross section ratio, pion production parameters, and final state interactions of pions exiting the nucleus. External data sets, primarily from [22][23][24], are used to determine the initial values and prior uncertainties of the parameters [4]. The energy spectrum of the neutrino beam and the neutrino cross section parameters are constrained using \u03bd \u03bc CC interactions in ND280. The fine-grained detectors (FGDs) [25] are scintillator trackers that serve as the primary neutrino target, and the momentum and identity of the particles emerging from the interaction are determined by the time projection chambers (TPCs) [26] interleaved with the FGDs. The muon is assumed to be the highestmomentum, negative-curvature track that emerges from the FGD fiducial volume with an energy deposition consistent with a muon in the TPC downstream of the FGD. Tracks found in the TPC upstream of the FGD are used to veto external background events.",

The samples are defined by the number of pions in the observed final state. A \u03c0 \u00fe can be identified in one of three ways: an FGD \u00fe TPC track with positive curvature and a TPC charge deposition consistent with a pion, an FGD-contained track with a charge deposition consistent with a pion, or a delayed energy deposit due to a decay electron from stopped \u03c0 \u00fe \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe in the FGD. To tag a \u03c0 \u2212 , only negative curvature FGD \u00fe TPC tracks are used. A \u03c0 0 is identified if there exists a track in the TPC with a charge deposition consistent with an electron from a \u03b3 conversion. Events containing no pions are classified as CC-0\u03c0, events with exactly one \u03c0 \u00fe and no \u03c0 \u2212 or \u03c0 0 are classified as CC-1\u03c0 \u00fe , and all other CC events are classified as CC other.

The dominant detector uncertainties come from events occurring outside the FGD fiducial volume and from pion reinteractions in the detector. The ND280 measurements constrain the SK flux parameters due to the flux covariance derived from beam simulations. The predicted numbers of ND280 events in Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, using the best-fit parameters, are 17352, 4110, and 4119 for the CC-0\u03c0, CC-1\u03c0 \u00fe , and CC-other samples, respectively. A \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test returns a p value of 0.66, indicating no disagreement between the data and the prediction using best-fit parameters. Figure 1 shows the muon momentum distribution of the CC-0\u03c0 sample, and the improvement in data and MC calculations agreement when using the best-fit parameters. The fit to the ND280 data gives estimates for 22 beam flux parameters at SK, the 5 common cross section parameters, and their covariance.

The new algorithm is a maximum-likelihood fit in which charge and time probability density functions are constructed for every PMT hit for a given particle hypothesis with a set of 7 parameters: the vertex position, the timing, the direction, and the momentum. Multiple-particle fit hypotheses are constructed by summing the charge contributions from each constituent particle.
