These processes are forbidden at tree level and can proceed only via loops, hence are rare. An important set of FCNC processes involve the transition of a b-quark to an s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state mediated by electroweak box and penguin diagrams. If heavy new particles exist, they may contribute to FCNC decay amplitudes, affecting the measurement of observables related to the decay under study. Hence FCNC processes allow searches for contributions from sources of physics beyond the SM (hereafter referred to as new physics). This analysis focuses on the decay B 0 d \u2192 K * 0 (892)\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , where K * 0 (892) \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 .

Candidates are required to satisfy p T (K * ) > 3.0 GeV. As the ATLAS detector does not have a dedicated charged-particle identification system, candidates are reconstructed with both possible K\u03c0 mass hypotheses. The selection implicitly relies on the kinematics of the reconstructed K * meson to determine which of the two tracks corresponds to the kaon. If both candidates in an event satisfy selection criteria, they are retained and one of them is selected in the next step following a procedure described below. The K\u03c0 invariant mass is required to lie in a window of twice the natural width around the nominal mass of 896 MeV, i.e. in the range [846,946] MeV. The charge of the kaon candidate is used to assign the flavour of the reconstructed B 0 d candidate.  5, where the decay time uncertainty \u03c3 \u03c4 is calculated from the covariance matrices associated with the four-track vertex fit and with the primary vertex fit. Background from final states partially reconstructed as B \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X accumulates at invariant mass below the B 0 d mass and contributes to the signal region. It is suppressed by imposing an asymmetric mass cut around the nominal B 0 d mass, 5150 MeV < m K\u03c0\u00b5\u00b5 < 5700 MeV. The high-mass sideband is retained, as the parameter values for the combinatorial background shapes are extracted from the fit to data described in section 5. To further suppress background, it is required that the angle \u0398, defined between the vector from the primary vertex to the B 0 d candidate decay vertex and the B 0 d candidate momentum, satisfies cos \u0398 > 0.999. Resolution effects on cos \u03b8 K , cos \u03b8 L and \u03c6 were found to have a negligible effect on the ATLAS B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 analysis [28]. It is assumed to also be the case for B 0 d \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . On average 12% of selected events in the data have more than one reconstructed B 0 d candidate. The fraction is 17% for signal MC samples and 2-10% for exclusive background MC samples. A two-step selection process is used for such events. For 4% of these events it is possible to select a candidate with the smallest value of the B 0 d vertex \u03c7 2 /NDF. However, the majority, about 96%, of multiple candidates arise from four-track combinations where the kaon and pion assignments are ambiguous. As these candidates have degenerate values for the B 0 d candidate vertex \u03c7 2 /NDF, a second selection step is required. The B 0 d candidate reconstructed with the smallest value of |m K\u03c0 \u2212 m K * |/\u03c3(m K\u03c0 ) is retained for analysis, where m K\u03c0 is the K * candidate mass, \u03c3(m K\u03c0 ) is the per-event uncertainty in this quantity, and m K * is the world average value of the K * mass.",

They are not accounted for in the nominal fit to data, and are treated as systematic effects. A peak is found in the cos \u03b8 K distribution near 1.0 and appears to have contributions from at least two distinct sources. One of these arises from misreconstructed B + decays, such as B + \u2192 K + \u00b5\u00b5 and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5\u00b5. These decays can be reconstructed as signal if another track is combined with the hadron to form a K * candidate in such a way that the event passes the reconstruction and selection. The second contribution comes from combinations of two charged tracks that pass the selection and are reconstructed as a K * candidate. These fake K * candidates accumulate around cos \u03b8 K of 1.0 and are observed in the K\u03c0 mass sidebands away from the K * meson. They are distinct from the structure of expected S-, P -and D-wave K\u03c0 decays resulting from a signal B 0 d \u2192 K\u03c0\u00b5\u00b5 transition. The origin of this source of background is not fully understood. The observed excess may arise from a statistical fluctuation, an unknown background process, or a combination of both. Systematic uncertainties are assigned to evaluate the effect of these two background contributions, as described in section 7.",

The P 4 and P 5 parameters have statistical correlation of 0.37 in the q 2 \u2208 [4.0, 6.0] GeV 2 bin. The observed deviation from the SM prediction of P 4 and P 5 is for both parameters approximately 2.7 standard deviations (local) away from the calculation of DHMV for this bin. The deviations are less significant for the other calculation and the fit approach. All measurements are found to be within three standard deviations of the range covered by the different predictions. Hence, including experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the measurements presented here are found to agree with the predicted SM contributions to this decay.",

It is not possible to extract a full correlation matrix between fitted parameters obtained from different fits. In order to reconstruct the correlation matrix, ensembles of pseudo-experiments are simulated using the pdf corresponding to the nominal angular distributions. Each simulated ensemble has the four folding schemes applied to it and four fits are performed on the resulting samples. The distributions obtained for pairs of parameters obtained from fits to these ensembles are used to compute Pearson correlation coefficients for those pairs. Correlation matrices for F L and the S parameters are reconstructed from all possible pairings for a given q 2 bin. A similar method is used to extract the correlation matrices for the P ( ) parameters. This procedure is repeated for each q 2 bin studied in order to obtain correlation matrices given in the remainder of this appendix. The correlation matrices are statistical only.
