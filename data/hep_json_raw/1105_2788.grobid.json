            "text": "We present a model-independent measurement of t-channel electroweak production of single top quarks in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. Using 5.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, and selecting events containing an isolated electron or muon, missing transverse energy and one or two jets originating from the fragmentation of b quarks, we measure a cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 tqb + X) = 2.90 \u00b1 0.59 (stat + syst) pb for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV. The probability of the background to fluctuate and produce a signal as large as the one observed is 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , corresponding to a significance of 5.5 standard deviations. Within the standard model (SM), top quarks are produced through two different types of interactions at hadron colliders. The largest yield is from tt pairs, produced via the strong interaction [1]. Pair production was used by the D0 and CDF collaborations to establish the existence of the top quark in 1995 [2,3]. The second source of top quarks is the electroweak production of single top quarks, observed by the D0 and CDF collaborations in 2009 [4,5].

            "text": "At the Tevatron, single top quarks are produced through W boson exchange, and accompanied by a b quark in the s channel (tb +tb = tb) [6], or by both a b and a light quark in the t-channel (tqb +tqb = tqb) [7,8]. A third process, usually called \"associated production,\" in which the top quark is produced together with a W boson, has negligible cross section at the Tevatron [9]. Prior D0 and CDF publications [4,5] measured the production cross section for the sum of tb and tqb while assuming the relative rate between the two processes as predicted by the SM. This relative rate, however, departs from the SM prediction in several new physics scenarios, for example, in models with additional quark generations [10], new heavy bosons [11], flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) [12], or anomalous top quark couplings [13][14][15]. It is therefore of interest to measure the tb and tqb production cross sections separately, using a methodology that is independent of theoretical assumptions about their relative rates [11]. Furthermore, measuring the production rates of the two single top quark production modes to a precision comparable to that of the tt pair cross section not only tests the validity of the parton distribution functions of the proton and antiproton, but also the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements [16] and higher-order corrections from quantum chromodynamics. These highprecision comparisons are important to check the selfconsistency of the standard model (SM).",

After btagging, we check the normalization of the W bb and W cc samples in a sample that has no overlap with the one used in the single top quark cross section measurement and find the normalization to be consistent with unity. We assign a 12% uncertainty on the normalization of the W bb and W cc samples to account for variations in the W cj (j = u, d, s) cross section and the W bb to W cc cross section ratio used in this study. We consider systematic uncertainties that arise from the theoretical and detector modeling of the background processes and from the subsequent corrections applied to that model. Most uncertainties affect only the normalization of the distributions, but the corrections for the jet energy scale (JES), the jet energy resolution (JER), and the reweighting of the kinematic distributions in W +jets events also modify the differential distributions. The largest uncertainties come from the JER, corrections to the b-tagging efficiency, and the corrections for the jetflavor composition in W +jets events, with smaller contribution from JES, MC statistics, integrated luminosity, and trigger uncertainties.

We use two of our previous methods: boosted decision trees (BDT) [28] and Bayesian neural networks (BNN) [29]. In addition, we use a third method, neuroevolution of augmented topologies (NEAT) [30]. All three methods use the same data and background model, consider the same sources of systematic uncertainty, and rely on variables with signal-background discrimination power chosen from a common set of well modeled variables from five categories [31,32]: single object kinematics, global event kinematics, jet reconstruction, top quark reconstruction, and angular correlations. The BDT method uses a common set of 50 variables for all analysis channels, while the NEAT method uses the TMVA implementation of the \"RuleFit\" algorithm [33,34] to select the 30 most sensitive kinematic variables in each channel. New for this analysis, the BNN method constructs a discriminant using the lepton and jet 4-vectors, the E T 2-vector, and variables that include lepton charge and b-tagging information, for a total of 14, 18 and 22 variables for events with 2, 3 and 4 jets. Each method is optimized to maximize the sensitivity to the tqb signal by treating the tb process as a background component with normalization given by the SM cross section [9]. Figure 1 shows the distributions of some of the variables that provide the greatest discrimination between the tqb and tb processes. To further improve the sensitivity, the analyses are performed separately on the six mutually exclusive subsamples defined before.",

We therefore combine these methods using an additional BNN algorithm (BNNComb) that takes as input the individual output discriminants of the BDT, BNN, and NEAT methods, and produces a single combined output discriminant. Figure 2 shows comparisons between the t-channel signal, the background model, and data for the combined discriminant, which leads to a more precise measurement of the cross section. The single top quark production cross section is measured using a Bayesian approach as in [4,17,18]. We follow the approach of [19] and construct a twodimensional (2D) posterior probability density as a function of the cross sections for the tqb and tb processes. The output discriminants for the signals, backgrounds, and data are used to form a binned likelihood as a product over all six analysis channels and all bins. No constraint is imposed on the relative rates of tb and tqb production. We assume a Poisson distribution for the observed number of events and uniform prior probabilities with positive values for the two signal cross sections. We integrate over the systematic uncertainties which are described by Gaussian priors that preserve the correlations between bins and channels. The tqb cross section is then extracted from a one-dimensional posterior probability density obtained from this 2D posterior by integrating over the tb axis, thus not making any assumptions about the value of the s-channel cross section. Similarly, the tb cross section is obtained by integrating over the tqb axis. Ensembles of datasets generated at several different cross section values are used to verify the linearity of the cross section extraction procedure. Figure 3 shows the 2D posterior probability density for the combined discriminant together with predictions from the SM [9] and various beyond-the-SM scenarios: four-quark-generations with CKM matrix element |V ts | = 0.2 [10], top-flavor model with new heavy bosons at a scale m x = 1 TeV [11], and FCNC with an up-quark/topquark/gluon coupling \u03ba u /\u039b = 0.036 [12]. The measured cross sections of \u03c3(pp \u2192 tqb + X) = 2.90 \u00b1 0.59 pb and \u03c3(pp \u2192 tb + X) = 0.98 \u00b1 0.63 pb are in good agreement with the SM expectation for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV [9]. The uncertainty includes both statistical and systematic sources. The cross section for t-channel single top quark production is the most precise measurement of an individual single top quark production channel to date with an uncertainty of 20%.",
