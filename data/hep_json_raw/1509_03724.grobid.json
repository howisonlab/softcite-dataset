The 0 + 1 , 2 + 1 and 2 + 2 transitions of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay were evaluated in an exposure of 89.5 kg\u2022yr of 136 Xe, while the same transitions of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay were evaluated in an exposure of 61.8 kg\u2022yr. No excess over background was found for all decay modes. The lower half-life limits of the 2 + 1 state transitions of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay were improved to T 0\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 2 + 1 ) > 2.6 \u00d7 10 25 yr and T 2\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 2 + 1 ) > 4.6 \u00d7 10 23 yr (90% C.L.), respectively. We report on the first experimental lower half-life limits for the transitions to the 0 + 1 state of 136 Xe for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. They are T 0\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 0 + 1 ) > 2.4 \u00d7 10 25 yr and T 2\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 0 + 1 ) > 8.3 \u00d7 10 23 yr (90% C.L.). The transitions to the 2 + 2 states are also evaluated for the first time to be T 0\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 2 + 2 ) > 2.6 \u00d7 10 25 yr and T 2\u03bd 1/2 (0 + \u2192 2 + 2 ) > 9.0 \u00d7 10 23 yr (90% C.L.). These results are compared to recent theoretical predictions.",

            "text": "Double-beta decay is a rare nuclear process with fundamental connections to particle physics, nuclear physics and possibly cosmology. Double-beta decay can be a leading process in the decay of a nucleus if the first order decay is energetically forbidden or highly suppressed. Two neutrino double-beta (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) decay, (A,Z) \u2192 (A, Z+2) + 2e \u2212 + 2\u03bd e , is an established second order process in the standard model of the electroweak interaction. 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the ground state has been observed in eleven nuclei with half-lives in the range from 10 19 to 10 24 yr [1,2,3]. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 transition to the 0 + 1 excited state of the daughter nucleus was also measured for two nuclei ( 100 Mo and 150 Nd) [1,4], although it is strongly suppressed in comparison with the transition to the ground state due to the smaller transition energies. The measured half-life of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay can experimentally constrain the relevant nuclear matrix element (NME). Measurement of different transitions provides useful information for the development of theoretical schemes to calculate NMEs. The understanding of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay NMEs is important for investigations of nuclear structure and of nuclear interactions associated with neutrinoless double-beta (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) decay [5].",

            "text": "Neutrino oscillation experiments demonstrated that neutrinos have nonzero mass and therefore the question arises whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac particles. 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is possible if the neutrino is a massive Majorana particle [6]. Various experimental efforts exist to search for this lepton number violating process since it implies physics beyond the standard model. In addition, if the decay is mediated by light Majorana neutrino exchange, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate can translate into an effective neutrino mass, m \u03b2\u03b2 \u2261 |\u03a3 i U 2 ei m \u03bd i |, via the NME and a phase-space factor, where U ei is the corresponding element of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata mixing matrix. It would constrain the absolute mass scale, and could provide information on the neutrino mass ordering. To obtain the effective neutrino mass, detailed knowledge of the NME for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is essential. The decay can proceed to the ground state as well as through transitions to excited states. Studies of these transitions provide additional information on the double-beta decay and associated NME calculations. Once 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is observed, the measurement of the branching ratios of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the ground and excited states allow the possibility to distinguish between different 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 mechanisms, such as those mediated through light or heavy Majorana neutrinos, or the R-parity breaking mechanism [7].",

            "text": "The KamLAND-Zen experiment is a modification of the existing neutrino detector KamLAND [10] located in the Kamioka mine, Gifu, Japan. A schematic diagram of the detector is shown in Fig. 2. The initial phase of the KamLAND-Zen experiment uses 13 tons of Xe-loaded liquid scintillator (Xe-LS) contained in a 3.08-m-diameter spherical inner balloon (IB), suspended at the center of the detector, as the double-beta decay source Ba. The energy levels and the branching ratios for the de-excitations are taken from Ref. [9]. Only the investigated 0 + and 2 + levels are shown. In the 0 + 1 \u2192 0 + transition, conversion electron emission is dominant. The data-acquisition system is triggered when the number of 17-inch PMTs hit is more than 70 within a 125 nsec window, the so-called primary trigger. This corresponds to a threshold of \u223c0.4 MeV. After each primary trigger, the threshold is lowered to \u223c0.25 MeV for 1 ms to study sequential decays. The event energy (visible energy) and position are reconstructed based on the photon hit-time and charge distribution. The energy response is calibrated with three kinds of sources; (i) 208 Tl 2.614 MeV \u03b3's from an artificial ThO 2 -W calibration source [11], (ii) 2.225 MeV \u03b3's from spallation neutrons capturing on protons, and (iii) 214 Bi (\u03b2 + \u03b3) from 222 Rn (\u03c4 = 5.5 days) introduced during the initial filling of the liquid scintillator. The energy resolution is estimated to be \u03c3 = (6.6 \u00b1 0.3)%/ \u221a E(MeV) from the energy distribution of (i). The systematic variation of the energy reconstruction with position or time is monitored by (ii), and is less than 1.0%. Energy nonlinearity effects caused by scintillator quenching and Cherenkov light production are constrained by the gamma peak of (i) and the spectral shape of (iii). The vertex resolution is estimated from the radial distribution of radioactive contaminants to be \u03c3 \u223c15 cm/ \u221a E(MeV) [11]. In KamLAND-Zen, the scintillation light of two coincident electrons generated from 136 Xe double-beta decay cannot be separated, only their summed energy is observed. 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the ground state has a continuous energy spectrum spanning from zero to the Q-value of 136 Xe. Decays to the excited states have similar spectra, but they begin at different values of visible energy spectra depending on the energies of the de-excitation emissions. In contrast to 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay produces a mono-energetic peak at the Q-value with width determined by the energy resolution. The peak position is shifted for different decay modes since quenching effects of the liquid scintillator depend on the identities of the emitted particles (electron or \u03b3 ray) and their energies. Fig. 3 shows the predicted energy spectra of 136 Xe double-beta decay to various excited states as well as to the ground state. The spectra have been convolved with the KamLAND-Zen detector response function, including energy resolution and particle-dependent energy scale non-linearities.",

To allow for the possibility of decay chain nonequilibrium, however, the Bi-Po measurements are used to constrain only the rates for the 222 Rn-210 Pb sub-chain of the 238 U series and the 228 Th-208 Pb subchain of the 232 Th series, while other background rates in both series are left unconstrained.",

The expected neutron capture fractions on protons, 12 C, 136 Xe and 134 Xe are 0.994, 0.006, 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , respectively. The neutron capture product 137 Xe (\u03b2 \u2212 , \u03c4 = 5.5 min, Q = 4.17 MeV) may be produced by 136 Xe as a potential background for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, but its expected rate is negligible. Event rates of carbon spallation products at KamLAND-Zen were obtained in Ref. [10]. They are 1.11 \u00b1 0.18 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 and (2.11 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 \u22122 (ton\u2022day) \u22121 for 11 C (\u03b2 + , \u03c4 = 29.4 min, Q = 1.98 MeV) and 10 C (\u03b2 + , \u03c4 = 27.8 s, Q = 3.65 MeV), respectively. For the muon induced products from xenon, we have no past experimental data. Spallation products from 136 Xe whose half-live are less than 100 sec, are studied with the present data. This is done by searching for time-correlations of events within a distance of 1.50 m from track-reconstructed muons depositing more than \u223c3 GeV of energy (so-called showering muons). Events in a time window of 0-500 sec after muon passage are assumed to be potentially the decays of muon spallation products, while events in a time window of 500-5,000 sec are used to estimate the accidental background. No correlated events are found in the energy range 1.2 < E < 2.0 MeV and 2.2 < E < 3.0 MeV.",

Only four nuclei can give a possible background in this energy window: 60 Co (\u03b2 \u2212 ,\u03c4 = 7.61 yrs, Q = 2.82 MeV), 88 Y (electron capture (EC), \u03c4 = 154 days, Q = 3.62 MeV), 110m Ag, and 208 Bi (EC, \u03c4 = 5.31 \u00d7 10 5 yrs, Q = 2.88 MeV). Due to their different lifetimes and the increased exposure time of this data set, the event rate time variation in the energy range 2.2 < E < 3.0 MeV exhibits a strong preference for the lifetime of 110m Ag [12]. In addition, the combined data set of DS-1 and DS-2 indicates that 110m Ag is also distributed on the IB. This activity is estimated from two-dimensional fits in radius and energy, assuming that the only contributions on the IB are from 214 Bi and 110m Ag [12]. The fit results for the 214 Bi and 110m Ag event rates on the IB are given in Table 2 for the two data sets. The 214 Bi rates are estimated after removing 214 Bi-214 Po sequential ",

The volume ratio of the fiducial volume to the total volume is 0.438 \u00b1 0.005 and 0.624 \u00b1 0.006, where the total volume was measured by the flow meter to be (16.51 \u00b1 0.17) m 3 during Xe-LS filling. The FV fraction is also estimated from the ratio of 214 Bi events which pass the FV cuts to the total number in the entire Xe-LS volume after subtraction of the IB surface contribution. The results for DS-1 are 0.421 \u00b1 0.007(stat) \u00b1 0.001(syst) and 0.620 \u00b1 0.007(stat) \u00b1 0.021(syst) for 1.2-m-radius and 1.35m-radius, respectively.

Combining the errors, we obtain 5.6% and 3.9% systematic uncertainties on the 1.20-m-radius and 1.35-m-radius for DS-1. Similarly, the error for DS-2 is estimated to be 6.3% and 4.1%. The uncertainty for DS-1 at 1.20-m-radius is slightly different from Ref. [2] due to improved energy/vertex reconstruction. The total systematic uncertainties for the double-beta decay half-life measurements for DS-1/DS-2 are 5.6%/6.3% and 3.9%/4.1% [12], obtained by adding all uncertainties listed in Table 3 in quadrature.",

No signal was observed and half-life limits at 90% C.L. were obtained as summarized in Table 4. The lower limits on 0 + \u2192 0 + 1 for 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay were improved by a factor of 49 and 4.0\u00d710 3 , respectively, from previous measurements.

The limit of 0 + \u2192 0 + 1 for 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay allows to constrain some theoretical predictions.",

The dominant background of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 0 + excited states comes from external 134 Cs. Replacement of the IB will reduce this radioactivity and provide improved sensitivity to this decay.",
