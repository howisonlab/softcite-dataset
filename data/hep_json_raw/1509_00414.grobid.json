            "text": "The decay B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is a b \u2192 d flavour-changing neutral-current process, which is suppressed in the Standard Model (SM). 1 The suppression arises since the b \u2192 d + \u2212 transition proceeds only through amplitudes involving the electroweak loop (penguin and box) diagrams shown in figure 1. In the SM, the top quark contribution dominates the loops, and an additional suppression occurs through the factor V td from the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The decay is therefore sensitive to the presence of new particles that are predicted to exist in extensions of the SM, particularly in models where the flavour structure differs from that of the SM [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. The ratio of CKM matrix elements |V td /V ts | has been measured [8,9] via B 0 and B 0 s mixing processes [10,11] and b \u2192 s(d)\u03b3 decays [12]; it can also be determined from a measurement of the ratio of the branching fractions of the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay to the more precisely measured B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay [13]. Such ratios are also sensitive to the flavour structure of physics beyond the SM.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. The magnetic field polarity is inverted with a period of several weeks during data taking, which allows the charge asymmetries due to the detector geometry to be determined.",

A boosted decision tree (BDT) [25,26] is trained using supervised learning with ten-fold cross validation [27] to achieve an unbiased classifier response. The background sample used to train the BDT consists of data from the upper sideband of the \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in the region greater than 5500 MeV/c 2 ; the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal sample is obtained from the simulation. As no particle identification information is used in the classifier, it can be applied to both the pion and kaon modes. The features of the data that are used to classify the \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidate as signalor background-like are the properties of the pion and muon tracks, and properties of the \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidate. For the pion and muon tracks, the features used are the transverse momentum of the tracks, the impact parameter of the track, and the track quality. For",

Pseudo-datasets were constructed from simulated signal events and combinatorial background events taken from the upper mass sideband of data.

Wilks' theorem [29] was used to determine a signal significance from fits to the pseudo-dataset, the value of which was passed to a maximisation algorithm that could vary the trial cut values. The classifier and particle identification cut values used to separate signal and background decays are chosen at the point of highest significance. Operating at this point, the classifier has a combinatorial background rejection of 99.8%, whilst retaining 66.9% of signal events, and each event contains only a single candidate.

The former decay is suppressed by requiring the \u00b5 + to have a low probability of being a kaon. The latter decay has the same final state as the signal and cannot be completely removed by the selection. However, the distribution of double semileptonic decays as a function of the \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass varies smoothly, and can be modelled well in the fit from which the signal yield is extracted.

The total model for the invariant mass distribution is composed of a signal model, a combinatorial background model, a model to describe partially reconstructed b-meson decays and a model to describe b-hadron decays with misidentified final-state particles. The signal model is an empirical function that consists of two Gaussian functions with power-law tails on both sides [30], and the same parameters are used for the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K + decay modes.

The yield of misidentified B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays is constrained using the measured branching fraction [13] and the observed pion-kaon misidentification efficiency. The mass distribution of the misidentified B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates is obtained by fitting the invariant mass distribution of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K + candidates, where the kaon is required to have the pion mass, and which has been corrected to account for differences in the particle identification efficiencies that arise from the differing kinematics.

This includes the geometrical acceptance of the LHCb detector and the efficiencies of the trigger and selection algorithms. These efficiencies are calculated using a combination of simulated signal events and data-driven methods. The use of the ratio of efficiencies of the decay modes ensures that many of the possible sources of systematic uncertainty largely cancel. The efficiency of the trigger depends on the kinematics of the muons, and this dependence contributes a source of systematic uncertainty relative to the signal yield at the level of 2%. The dependence of the particle identification efficiency on the kinematic distributions contributes a systematic uncertainty of < 0.1% for the muons, 2% for the pions and < 0.1% for the kaons. These uncertainties are evaluated by varying the binning of the kinematic variables, and include a contribution from the size of the calibration samples used. The calculation of the BDT efficiency is affected by small differences between the simulation and data. The dependence of the signal yield on these differences is assessed using the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )\u03c0 + decays. The relatively large yield allows precise comparisons of data and simulation. The impact of using simulation to calculate the efficiency of the BDT is assessed using the observed differences between data and simulation in the normalisation channel; a systematic uncertainty of 1.4% is assigned.",
