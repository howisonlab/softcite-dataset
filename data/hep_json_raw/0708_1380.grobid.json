Recently a lot of work [1] has been invested to develop sophisticated Monte Carlo programs capable of handling more particle in the final state at the leading order (LO), or in some cases, next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD. Measurements of W + jet cross sections are an important test of QCD and may be used to validate these new approaches. A good understanding of W + jet production is vital to reduce the uncertainty on the background to top pair production and to increase the sensitivity to higgs and new physics searches at the Tevatron and the LHC.",

The cross section is presented for four inclusive n-jets samples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) as a function of the n th \u2212leading jet transverse energy (E jet T ). For W + \u2265 2 jets the differential cross section with respect to the 2-leading jets invariant mass m j 1 j 2 and angular separation \u2206R j 1 j 2 is also reported. Cross sections have been corrected to particle level jets, and are defined within a limited W decay phase space, closely matching that which is experimentally accessible. This definition, easily reproduced theoretically, minimizes the model dependence that can enter a correction back to the full W cross-section. These results thus offer the potential for extensive tuning of W+jet(s) Monte Carlo approaches at the hadron-level. This analysis is based on 320 \u00b1 18 pb \u22121 of data collected by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) during the Tevatron Run II period.",

To extract the background fraction in each W + \u2265 n\u2212jet sample the E / T distribution of candidates is fitted to background and signal templates ( Fig. 1 upper left-hand side). For this fit the W-like backgrounds and signal are modeled using detector simulated Monte Carlo event samples. The QCD background is modeled using a \"fake-electron\" event sample, formed from the same candidate trigger dataset by requiring that at least two of the lepton identification cuts fail while maintaining all kinematic requirements. Cross-checks of this method have been performed by looking to other W kinematic distributions as the transverse mass of the W m W T and the electron E e T ( Fig. 1 upper right-hand side). In all these variables a very good agreement between data and background models has been found.",

At low E jet T it is 10% (40%) in the 1 \u2212 jet (4 \u2212 jets) sample, rising to 90% at the highest E background fraction is given as a function of the minimum E jet T used to define the W + jet sample. The systematic uncertainty on the background estimate derives mainly from the limited statistics of the \"fake-electron\" sample used to model the QCD background, but at high jet multiplicity the 10% uncertainty on the measured top pair production cross section is also significant. In Fig. 2 is plotted the effect of this uncertainty on the cross section for W + 1 and 2 jet as a function of the minimum E jet T . A full detector simulation has been used to take into account selection efficiencies, coming from geometric acceptance, electron identification and E / T and E e T resolution effects. The full CDF II detector simulation accurately reproduces electron acceptance and identification inefficiencies: no evidence of a difference between data and simulation have been found in the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 sample. To minimize the theoretical uncertainty in the extrapolation of the measurement, the cross section has been defined for the W phase space accessible by the CDF II detector: E e T > 20GeV, |\u03b7 e | < 1.1, E/ T > 30GeV and m W T > 20GeV/c 2 . This eliminates the dependence on Monte Carlo models to extrapolate the visible cross section to the full W phase space. Nevertheless Monte Carlo events have been used to correct for inefficiency and boundary effects on the kinematic selection that defines the cross section. Different Monte Carlo prescriptions have been checked and the critical parameters have been largely scanned. These effects turned out to be at the 5% level at low E jet T . They have been included into the systematic uncertainty on the efficiency which is (60 \u00b1 3)%, largely independent of the jet kitematic. As shown in Fig. 2, the acceptance contribute a small error to the total uncertainty on the cross section. The candidate event yield, background fractions, and acceptance factors are combined to form the \"raw\" W + \u2265 n\u2212jet cross section in each bin of the E jet T spectra. The raw cross sections are unfolded for detector effects on the measured jet energies and corrected to the hadron level using Monte Carlo events. Alpgen [5] interfaced with PYTHIA-TUNE A [6,7] provides a reasonable description of the jet and underlying event properties, and is used to determine the correction factors, defined as the ratio of the hadron level cross section to the raw reconstructed cross section, used in the unfolding procedure. To avoid dependence of such a correction on the assumed Monte Carlo hadron level E jet T distribution, an iterative procedure is used to reweight the events at the hadron level until the hadron level E jet T distribution agrees with the corresponding data-unfolded distribution to within the systematic uncertainties on the measurement. The unfolding factors vary between 0.95 and 1.2 over the measured range of E jet T . The measured jet energies were varied by \u00b1\u03c3 \u223c 3% as detailed in [4], to account for systematic effects introduced by the uncertainty on the calorimeter absolute energy scale. The total systematic on the cross section introduced by the jet energy measurement is dominated by the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale and ranges between 5% and 20%, increasing with E jet T . The measured cross section are shown in Fig. 3. Results are presented as both cumulative",
