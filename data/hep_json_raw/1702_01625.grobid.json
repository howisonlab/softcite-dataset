This reaction is accessible at the Large Hadron Collider thanks to the large electromagnetic field strengths generated by ultra-relativistic colliding lead ions. Using 480 \u00b5b \u22121 of lead-lead collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS detector, here we report evidence for light-by-light scattering. A total of 13 candidate events were observed with an expected background of 2.6 \u00b1 0.7 events. After background subtraction and analysis corrections, the fiducial cross-section of the process Pb + Pb (\u03b3 \u03b3 ) \u2192 Pb ( * ) + Pb ( * ) \u03b3 \u03b3 , for photon transverse energy E T > 3 GeV, photon absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.4, diphoton invariant mass greater than 6 GeV, diphoton transverse momentum lower than 2 GeV and diphoton acoplanarity below 0.01, is measured to be 70 \u00b1 24 (stat.) \u00b117 (syst.) nb, which is in agreement with the standard model predictions.",

This forbids effects such as light-by-light (LbyL) scattering, \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , which is a purely quantum-mechanical process. It was realized in the early history of quantum electrodynamics (QED) that LbyL scattering is related to the polarization of the vacuum 1 . In the standard model of particle physics, the virtual particles that mediate the LbyL coupling are electrically charged fermions or W \u00b1 bosons. In QED, the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 reaction proceeds at lowest order in the fine-structure constant (\u03b1 em ) via virtual one-loop box diagrams involving fermions ( Fig. 1a), which is an O(\u03b1 4 em \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 9 ) process, making it challenging to test experimentally. Indeed, the elastic LbyL scattering has remained unobserved: even the ultra-intense laser experiments are not yet powerful enough to probe this phenomenon 2 .",

A related process involving only real photons, in which several photons fuse to form an electron-positron pair (e + e \u2212 ), has been measured in ref. 11.

            "text": "An alternative way by which LbyL interactions can be studied is by using relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In 'ultra-peripheral collision' (UPC) events, with impact parameters larger than twice the radius of the nuclei 13,14 , the strong interaction does not play a role. The electromagnetic (EM) field strengths of relativistic ions scale with the proton number (Z). For example, for a lead (Pb) nucleus with Z = 82 the field can be up to 10 25 V m \u22121 (ref. 15), much larger than the Schwinger limit 16 above which QED corrections become important. In the 1930s it was found that highly relativistic charged particles can be described by the equivalent photon approximation (EPA) [17][18][19] , which is schematically shown in Fig. 1b. The EM fields produced by the colliding Pb nuclei can be treated as a beam of quasi-real photons with a small virtuality of Q 2 < 1/R 2 , where R is the radius of the charge distribution and so Q 2 < 10 \u22123 GeV 2 . Then, the cross-section for the reaction Pb + Pb (\u03b3 \u03b3 ) \u2192 Pb + Pb \u03b3 \u03b3 can be calculated by convolving the respective photon flux with the elementary cross-section for the process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 . Since the photon flux associated with each nucleus scales as Z 2 , the cross-section is extremely enhanced as compared with proton-proton (pp) collisions.",

            "text": "In this article, a measurement of LbyL scattering in Pb + Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is reported, following the approach recently proposed in ref. 20. The final-state signature of interest is the exclusive production of two photons, Pb + Pb (\u03b3 \u03b3 ) \u2192 Pb ( * ) + Pb ( * ) \u03b3 \u03b3 , where a possible EM excitation of the outgoing ions 21 is denoted by ( * ). Hence, the expected signature is two photons and no further activity in the central detector, since the Pb ( * ) ions escape into the LHC beam pipe. Moreover, it is predicted that the background is relatively low in heavy-ion collisions and is dominated by exclusive dielectron (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) production 20,22 . The misidentification of electrons as photons can occur when the electron track is not reconstructed or the electron emits a hardbremsstrahlung photon. The fiducial cross-section of the process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 in Pb + Pb collisions is measured, using a data set recorded at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy ( \u221a s NN ) of 5.02 TeV. This data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 480 \u00b1 30 \u00b5b \u22121 . In addition to the measured fiducial cross-section, the significance of the observed number of signal candidate events is given, assuming the background-only hypothesis.",

The \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 background is modelled with STARlight 1.1 (ref. 30), in which the cross-section is computed by combining the Pb + Pb EPA with the leading-order formula for \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . This process has been recently measured by the ALICE Collaboration, and a good agreement with STARlight is found 33 . The exclusive diphoton final state can be also produced via the strong interaction through a quark loop in the exchange of two gluons in a colour-singlet state (see Supplementary Fig. 2). This CEP process, gg \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , is modelled using SUPERCHIC 2.03 (ref. 34), in which the pp crosssection has been scaled by A 2 R 4 g as suggested in ref. 20, where A = 208 and R g \u2248 0.7 is a gluon shadowing correction 35 . This process has a large theoretical uncertainty, of O (100%), mostly related to incomplete knowledge of gluon densities 36 . The \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 qq contribution is estimated using Herwig++ 2.7.1 (ref. 37) where the EPA formalism in pp collisions is implemented.

Advancements on these two points would also allow for reconstruction of low-mass mesons decaying into two photons, which in turn could be used to improve detector calibration. The heavy-ion data yield is expected to double at the end of 2018 (and again increase tenfold after LHC Run 4, scheduled to start in 2026), which would significantly reduce the statistical uncertainty. Future upgrades of ATLAS, such as extended tracking acceptance from |\u03b7| < 2.5 to |\u03b7| < 4.0, will further improve this. Data availability.
