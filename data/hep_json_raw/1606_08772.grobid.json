The search uses 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Bottom squarks are searched for in events containing large missing transverse momentum and exactly two jets identified as originating from bquarks. No excess above the expected Standard Model background yield is observed. Exclusion limits at 95 % confidence level on the mass of the bottom squark are derived in phenomenological supersymmetric R-parity-conserving models in which theb 1 is the lightest squark and is assumed to decay exclusively viab 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 0 1 , where\u03c7 0 1 is the lightest neutralino. The limits significantly extend previous results; bottom squark masses up to 800 (840) GeV are excluded for the\u03c7 0 1 mass below 360 (100) GeV whilst differences in mass above 100 GeV between theb 1 and the\u03c7 0 1 are excluded up to ab 1 mass of 500 GeV.",

In the framework of the R-parityconserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [11][12][13], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, providing a possible candidate for dark matter [14,15]. In a large variety of models the LSP is the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ). Naturalness considerations [16,17] suggest that the supersymmetric partners of the third-generation SM quarks are the lightest coloured supersymmetric particles. This may lead to the lightest bottom squark (b 1 ) and top squark (t 1 ) mass e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch eigenstates 1 being significantly lighter than the other squarks and the gluinos.

A SUSY particle mass hierarchy with this exclusive decay has been predicted by various phenomenological MSSM models [18]. Searches with the \u221a s = 8 TeV LHC Run-1 dataset at ATLAS and CMS have set limits onb 1 masses in such scenarios. For\u03c7 0 1 masses around 100 GeV, exclusion limits at 95 % confidence level (CL) up to 620 and 680 GeV have been reported by the ATLAS [19] and CMS [20] collaborations, respectively. The searches were performed in events characterized by the presence of large missing transverse momentum and two jets identified as containing b-hadrons (b-jets). In Run 2 of the LHC the production cross-section rises due to the increase of the centre-of-mass energy of the pp collisions. For instance, for ab 1 with a mass of 800 GeV, the production cross-section increases by almost a factor of ten going from \u221a s = 8 TeV to \u221a s = 13 TeV. In addition, the sensitivity of the analysis benefits from the improved algorithms adopted to identify b-jets and use of information from the newly installed pixel layer in the Run-2 ATLAS detector. The search strategy at 13 TeV closely follows the previous ATLAS studies, with signal regions defined to provide sensitivity to the kinematic topologies arising from different mass splittings between the bottom squark and the neutralino.",

The matrix element (ME) calculation is performed at tree level and includes the emission of up to two additional partons. The PDF set used for the generation is NNPDF23LO [33]. The ME-PS matching is done using the CKKW-L [34] prescription, with a matching scale set to one quarter of the bottom squark mass. The cross-sections used to evaluate the signal yields are calculated to nextto-leading-order accuracy in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-toleading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO + NLL) [35][36][37]. SM background samples are simulated using different MC generator programs depending on the process. Events containing W or Z bosons with associated jets, including jets from the fragmentation of b-and c-quarks (heavy-flavour jets), are simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 [38] generator. Matrix elements are calculated for up to two additional partons at next-to-leading order (NLO) and four partons at leading order (LO) using the Comix [39] and OpenLoops [40] matrix element generators and merged with the Sherpa PS [41] using the ME + PS@NLO prescription [42]. The CT10 [43] PDF set is used in conjunction with a dedicated PS tune developed by the Sherpa authors. The W /Z +jets events are normalized to their next-to-NLO (NNLO) QCD theoretical cross-sections [44]. For a cross-check of the modelling of Z +jets background, samples of events containing a photon produced in association with jets, including heavyflavour jets, are simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 generator with matrix elements calculated at LO with up to four partons for the LO calculation.",

A likelihood function is built as the product of Poisson probability functions, using as constraints the observed and expected (from MC simulation) event yields in the control regions but not the yields in the corresponding SR [74]. The normalization factors for each of the simulated backgrounds are adjusted simultaneously via a profile likelihood fit [75] (referred to as the \"background-only fit\").

Uncertainties due to the limited number of events in the CRs are also taken into account in the fit. The individual contributions are outlined in Table 5. The dominant detector-related systematic effects are due to the uncertainties in the jet energy scale (JES) [58] and resolution (JER) [59], and in the b-tagging efficiency and mis-tagging rates. The JES and JER uncertainties are estimated from 13 TeV data, while the uncertainties related to b-tagging are estimated from 8 TeV data and extrapolated to 13 TeV and to the Run-2 detector conditions. The uncertainties associated with lepton and photon reconstruction and energy measurements are also considered but have a small impact on the final results. Lepton, photon and jet-related uncertainties are propagated to the calculation of the E miss T , and additional uncertainties are included in the energy scale and resolution of the soft term.

Experimental uncertainties, which are found to be between 20 and 25 % across theb 1 -\u03c7 0 1 mass plane for all SRs, are largely dominated by the uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency in SRA, while JER and b-tagging uncertainties are dominant in SRB with equal contributions. Theoretical uncertainties in the NLO + NLL cross-section are calculated for each SUSY signal scenario and are dominated by the uncertainties in the renormalization and factorization scales, followed by the uncertainty in the PDF. They vary between 15 and 20 % for bottom squark masses in the range between 400 and 900 GeV. Additional uncertainties in the modelling of initial-state radiation in SUSY signal MC samples are taken into account and contribute up to 5 %. Table 6 reports the observed number of events and the SM predictions after the background-only fit for each signal region. The largest background contribution in SRA arises from Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd produced in association with b-quarks whilst top-quark pair production dominates SM predictions for SRB. The background-only fit results are compared to the pre-fit predictions based on MC simulation. Figures 2  and 3 show the comparison between the observed data and the SM predictions for some relevant kinematic distributions in SRA250 and SRB, respectively, prior to the selec-tion on the variable shown. For illustrative purposes, the distributions expected for a scenario with bottom squark and neutralino masses of 700 GeV (400 GeV) and 1 GeV (300 GeV), respectively, are shown for SRA250 (SRB). No excess above the expected Standard Model background yield is observed. The results are translated into upper limits on contributions from new physics beyond the SM (BSM) for each signal region. The CL s method [79,80] is used to derive the confidence level of the exclusion; signal models with a CL s value below 0.05 are said to be excluded at 95 % CL. The profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic is used to exclude the signal-plus-background hypothesis for specific signal models. When normalized by the integrated luminosity of the data sample, results can be interpreted as corresponding upper limits on the visible cross-section, \u03c3 vis , defined as the product of the BSM production cross-section, the acceptance and the selection efficiency of a BSM signal. Table 7 summarizes the observed (S 95 obs ) and expected (S 95 exp ) 95 % CL upper limits on the number of BSM events and on \u03c3 vis .",

In this case, the fit procedure takes into account not only correlations in the yield predictions between control and signal regions due to common background normalization parameters and systematic uncertainties but also contamination in the control regions from SUSY signal events (found to be generally negligible). The experimental systematic uncertainties in the signal are taken into account for this calculation and are assumed to be fully correlated with those in the SM background.

At each point of the parameter space, the SR with the best expected sensitivity is adopted. Sensitivity to scenarios with the largest mass difference between theb 1 and Events / 50 GeV 1 is achieved with the most stringent m CT threshold (SRA450). Sensitivity to scenarios with smaller mass differences is achieved predominantly with searches based on the presence of a highp T ISR jet, as in the dedicated SRB selection and the search described in Ref.

The analysis uses 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experi-ment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Bottom squarks are searched for in events containing large missing transverse momentum and up to four jets, exactly two of which are identified as b-jets. No excess above the expected Standard Model background yield is found. Exclusion limits at 95 % confidence level are placed on the visible cross-section and on the mass of the bottom squark in phenomenological supersymmetric R-parity-conserving models in which theb 1 is the lightest squark and is assumed to decay exclusively viab 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 0 1 , where\u03c7 0 1 is the lightest neutralino.

Further track-based selections are applied to reject jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 that originate from pile-up interactions [61] and the expected event average energy contribution from pile-up clusters is subtracted using a factor dependent on the jet area [58]. Jets are classified as \"baseline\" and \"signal\". Baseline jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8. Signal jets, selected after resolving overlaps with electrons and muons, are required to pass the stricter requirement of p T > 35 GeV. Jets are identified as b-jets if tagged by a multivariate algorithm which uses information about the impact parameters of inner detector tracks matched to the jet, the presence of displaced secondary vertices, and the reconstructed flight paths of b-and c-hadrons inside the jet [62]. The btagging working point with a 77 % efficiency, as determined in a simulated sample of tt events, was chosen as part of the optimization process discussed in Sect. 5. The corresponding rejection factors against jets originating from c-quarks and from light quarks and gluons at this working point are 4.5 and 130, respectively [63]. To compensate for differences between data and MC simulation in the b-tagging efficiencies and mis-tag rates, correction factors derived from data-driven methods are applied to the simulated samples[64]. Candidate b-tagged jets are required to have p T > 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.",
