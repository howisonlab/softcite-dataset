The measurements are based on proton-proton collision data produced at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb \u22121 for each experiment. The measurements used events containing one lepton and having different jet multiplicities in the final state. The results are quoted as fractions of W bosons with longitudinal (F 0 ), left-handed (F L ), or right-handed (F R ) polarizations. The resulting combined measurements of the polarization fractions are F 0 = 0.693 \u00b1 0.014 and F L = 0.315 \u00b1 0.011. The fraction F R is calculated from the unitarity constraint to be F R = \u22120.008 \u00b1 0.007. These results are in agreement with the standard model predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics and represent an improvement in precision of 25 (29)% for F 0 (F L ) with respect to the most precise single measurement. A limit on anomalous right-handed vector (V R ), and left-and right-handed tensor (g L , g R ) tWb couplings is set while fixing all others to their standard model values. The allowed regions are [\u22120.11, 0.16]  for V R , [\u22120.08, 0.05] for g L , and [\u22120.04, 0.02] for g R , at 95% confidence level. Limits on the corresponding Wilson coefficients are also derived.",

            "text": "The large number of top quarks produced at the CERN LHC provides an excellent laboratory for the study of their production and decay properties. Precise predictions of some of these properties are available in the standard model (SM) of particle physics, and are tested through detailed comparisons to data. Potential deviations between data and predictions could reveal important information on the existence of new physics beyond the SM. The properties of the top quark decay vertex tWb are governed by the structure of the weak interaction. In the SM, this interaction has a V \u2212 A structure, where V and A refer to the vector and axial-vector components of the weak current. This structure, along with the masses of the particles involved, determines the fractions of JHEP08(2020)051 W bosons with longitudinal (F 0 ), left-handed (F L ), and right-handed (F R ) polarizations, referred to as polarization fractions. Theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predict the fractions to be F 0 = 0.687 \u00b1 0.005, F L = 0.311 \u00b1 0.005, and F R = 0.0017 \u00b1 0.0001 [1], assuming a top quark mass of 172.8 \u00b1 1.3 GeV. Thus, the SM predictions can be tested in high-precision measurements of the polarization fractions, and potential new physics processes that modify the structure of the tWb vertex can be probed.",

In the measurements used in this paper, only angles from top quarks decaying semileptonically to electrons or muons are considered. Imposing a unitarity constraint between the three polarization fractions, F 0 + F L + F R = 1, results in two independent observables. The W boson polarization fractions have been measured in proton-antiproton collisions by the CDF and D0 experiments [2] at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV with experimental uncertainties of 10-15% in F 0 and F L . The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have performed measurements at the LHC in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 7 [3,4] and 8 [5][6][7] TeV, reaching a precision in F 0 and F L of 3-5%. All measurements are in agreement with the SM NNLO predictions within their experimental uncertainties. However, these experimental uncertainties are larger than those of the current theoretical predictions, which are less than 2%. Improving the experimental precision motivates the combination of the ATLAS and CMS measurements: combining measurements based on independent data sets reduces the statistical uncertainty, while the overall uncertainty can be further decreased by exploiting the differences in experimental systematic effects stemming from the use of the two detectors and different analysis methods.",

The latter corresponds to events including jets misidentified as leptons, or non-prompt leptons from hadron decay passing the +jets selection.

In addition to the systematic uncertainties considered for the tt measurement, a few specific uncertainties were included for the CMS (single top) measurement. For the specific case of single top quark processes, unlike for tt production, the polarization fractions can also be altered at the production level. To study this effect, pseudo-data were generated from samples simulated using CompHEP and Single Top [41] event generators with varied values of the couplings g L , V R , and V L (as described in section 5.2) both at the single top quark production and decay, and the polarization fractions values were extracted using the analysis fitting framework. The differences between the generated and fitted values were taken as the systematic uncertainty. Secondly, a small difference in the generated W boson polarization fraction values was observed for the tt events, simulated with MadGraph, and single top quark events, simulated with powheg. This difference of about 0.01 was taken into account as an uncertainty in the measurement. Finally, the effect of fixing the signal normalization in the fit was considered. All these uncertainties are merged into a single uncertainty, referred to as Single top method in tables 2-4 and 6-7. In all input measurements, the uncertainty in the modelling of colour reconnection was found to be negligible and therefore was not considered.",

Limits on these anomalous couplings are set using the EFTfitter tool [50]. The anomalous couplings are assumed to introduce no additional CP violation, and are taken to be real. The allowed regions at 68 and 95% CL and the most probable couplings values are shown, as derived from the measured polarization fractions reported in refs. [5,6], and from the combined results presented in this paper. A second region allowed by the W boson polarization measurements around Re(g R ) = 0.8 is excluded by the single top quark cross section measurements [51,52], and therefore is not shown in this figure. Table 8 shows the 95% CL intervals for each anomalous coupling, while fixing all others to their SM values. These limits correspond to the set of smallest intervals containing 95% of the marginalized posterior distribution for the corresponding parameter. In a similar way, limits are set in terms of Wilson coefficients.
