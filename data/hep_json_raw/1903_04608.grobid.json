            "text": "SBN is designed to address the possible existence of 1 eV mass-scale sterile neutrinos (2). Sterile neutrino states, if they exist, are not directly observable since they do not interact with ordinary matter through the weak interaction, but active-sterile mixing could generate new oscillations among the standard neutrino flavors. The search for light sterile neutrinos at SBN is motivated by a set of anomalous results in past neutrino data, most significantly from the LSND (3) and MiniBooNE (4,5,6) experiments. We now require precision followup experiments to either confirm or rule out the existence of these new neutrino states. SBN will test this important question using multiple, functionally identical detectors sitting along the same neutrino beam, which is the key to the experiment's world-leading sensitivity. A discovery would reveal a new, unexpected form of fundamental particle and drive further experimentation in this area for years to come. A clear null result from SBN, or a Standard Model explanation for the earlier anomalies, would bring a welcome resolution to a longstanding puzzle and greatly clarify the current picture in neutrino physics. Light sterile neutrinos, in some scenarios, can have significant impacts on measurements of CP violation and other oscillation parameters in DUNE (see e.g. Refs. (7,8,9,10)) and on searches for neutrinoless double \u03b2 decay (see e.g. Refs. (11,12,13,14)), further motivating a precision search for sterile neutrinos at SBN. Figure 1 depicts the layout of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program, where three large liquid argon TPCs (LArTPC) will sit along the existing Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois (USA). The MicroBooNE detector, an 89 ton active mass LArTPC located 470 m along the beam, has been collecting data in the BNB since October 2015. Earlier in that same year, a proposal (15) was presented and approved to augment the MicroBooNE detector with two additional LArTPCs -a near detector close to the source that can characterize the neutrino beam before any substantial oscillation can occur and, thereby, greatly reduce systematic uncertainties in a search for oscillation signals downstream, and a larger far detector to be installed just downstream of MicroBooNE to increase the statistics of a potential signal. The near detector, SBND (or the Short-Baseline Near Detector), will be an all new 112 ton active mass LArTPC sited only 110 m from the neutrino production target. The far detector will be the existing 476 ton active mass ICARUS-T600 detector that has been refurbished and upgraded for optimal performance in SBN, and is now being readied for operation in a new experimental hall 600 m from the target. The addition of SBND and ICARUS creates a world-leading sterile neutrino search experiment that can cover the parameters allowed by past anomalies at \u2265 5\u03c3 significance. ICARUS and SBND are scheduled to come online in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",

In Section 2 we review the experimental anomalies (Sec. 2.1), phenomenology (Sec. 2.2), and current experimental landscape (Sec. 2.3) of light sterile neutrinos. In Section 3 we describe the beam and detectors of the Short-Baseline Neutrino experimental program, focusing on the new near and far detectors, SBND (Sec. 3.2) and ICARUS (Sec. 3.3). Then in Section 4 we turn to the science program of SBN, beginning with the flagship sterile neutrino oscillation searches in Section 4.1. The science of SBN goes well beyond this, however, including a rich program of precision studies of the physics of neutrino-nucleus scattering (Sec. 4.2) and an ever-increasing range of ideas, now under active development, for using the SBN detectors and beam to search for signatures of new physics, from extra dimensions to light dark matter (Sec. 4.3). We conclude in Section 5 with an outlook for the future at SBN.",

A 2011 reevaluation of the flux of neutrinos produced in reactors lifted the expected\u03bde flux by \u223c 3% (22,23). This effect, together with improved theoretical uncertainties, led to a shift in the ratio of total observed events over the predicted number of events in a number of reactor experiments, with an average value of R = 0.94 \u00b1 0.02. This is the origin of the so-called 'reactor anomaly'. Some have noted that a possible underestimation of theoretical uncertainties could have considerably increased the significance of the reactor anomaly (24), although the NEOS (25) and DANSS (26) experiments have observed spectral features also consistent with sterile neutrino oscillations. Additionally, calibration data from gallium solar neutrino detectors using intense radioactive neutrino sources (27,28) and the theoretical cross section for neutrino capture \u03bde+ 71 Ga \u2192 71 Ge+e \u2212 (29) leads to a 3\u03c3 deficit compared to the expected number of events (30,31,32). This is known as the 'gallium anomaly'.",

Second, shortbaseline transitions \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bde require non-zero Ue4 and U\u00b54, thus necessarily inducing both \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u00b5 and \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde probabilities less than 1. This can be used to over-constrain the parameter space by observing \u03bde appearance together with \u03bde and \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance at short-baselines.

Null results from solar neutrino data and the LSND/KARMEN 12 C data constrain |Ue4| 2 0.065.

While this global analysis has been performed for a 3+1 scenario, no significant improvement is expected in scenarios with extra sterile neutrino species (see, e.g., Refs. (32,48)). Also, light sterile neutrinos with sizable mixing angles (above the percent level, see e.g. Ref (49)) would thermalize in the early universe, contributing to the effective number of relativistic species. The current limit, N eff = 2.99 \u00b1 0.17, derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background and fits to the \u039bCDM model of cosmology (50), would imply a non-standard cosmological history for the sterile neutrinos and thus more ingredients of beyond Standard Model physics.

The neutrino beam is created by extracting 8 GeV kinetic energy protons from the Booster accelerator and impacting them on a beryllium target to produce a secondary beam of hadrons, mainly pions. Charged secondaries are focused by a single toroidal aluminum alloy focusing horn that surrounds the target. The horn is supplied with 174 kA in 143 \u00b5s pulses coincident with proton delivery. The horn can be pulsed with either polarity, thus focusing either positives or negatives and de-focusing the other. Focused mesons are allowed to propagate down a 50 m long, 0.91 m radius air-filled tunnel where the majority will decay to produce muon and electron neutrinos. The remainder are absorbed into a concrete and steel absorber at the end of the 50 m decay region. The Booster spill length is 1.6 \u00b5s with nominally 5\u00d710 12 protons per spill delivered to the beryllium target. The BNB has already successfully and stably operated for more than fifteen years in both neutrino and anti-neutrino modes. The fluxes are well understood thanks to a detailed simulation (52) developed by the MiniBooNE collaboration and the availability of dedicated hadron production data for 8.9 GeV/c p+Be interactions collected at the HARP experiment at CERN (53). Systematic uncertainties associated with the beam have also been characterized in a detailed way, with a total error of 9% at the peak of the \u03bd\u00b5 flux and larger in the low and high energy regions. The composition of the flux in neutrino mode (focusing positive hadrons) is energy dependent, but is dominated by \u03bd\u00b5 (93.6%), followed by\u03bd\u00b5 (5.9%), with an intrinsic \u03bde/\u03bde contamination at the level of 0.5% at energies below 1.5 GeV.",

The detector consists of a large open volume of ultra-pure liquid argon (87 K) surrounded by a high voltage cathode surface on one face and an anode surface opposite to it. When a neutrino undergoes a charged-current or neutral-current weak interaction with an argon nucleus, resulting charged particles ionize and excite argon atoms as they propagate in the liquid. Freed electrons drift in the inert medium under the influence of the electric field between the cathode and anode (made uniform by a field cage surrounding the liquid volume), with field strengths of 500 V/cm typical. In a 'single-phase' wire readout detector, the clouds of drifted electrons generate small currents on taught sense wires located on the anode side of the detector boundary. The wires are closely spaced to form planes (wire pitch in the 3-5 mm range). To generate multi-dimensional views of particle tracks, two or three planes of wires, oriented at different angles are used. The wires are biased to guide electrons past the first wire planes, where the electron clouds induce bipolar signals as they pass, and they collect on the positively biased back most plane, producing a unipolar signal proportional to the total ionization in that location. The detector, therefore, is a totally active, fine-sampling calorimeter with millimeter-level particle tracking capabilities. Electron drift speeds are slow, in the range of 1.6 mm/\u00b5s, requiring a continuous readout time of 1-2 milliseconds for a detector that is 2-3 m across.",

A detailed description of the ICARUS-T600 LArTPC detector can be found in Ref. (59). The detector has been operated for 3 years (2011-2013) in the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy, where it demonstrated the underground operation of a large high-purity LAr detctor (60,61,62), measured the neutrino velocity (63,64,65), and searched for evidence of neutrino oscillations (37) using the CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso (CNGS) neutrino beam. The detector is divided into two identical, adjacent cryostat modules (T300), as can be seen in Fig. 5. Each T300 module houses two TPCs made of three parallel wire planes, 3 mm apart, the first with horizontal wires and the other two at \u00b160 \u2022 from the horizontal direction (see Fig. 5, right). Wires are made of AISI 304V stainless steel with a wire diameter of 150 \u00b5m. The dimensions of the active volume in each T300 half module are 18.0 m (L) \u00d7 3.2 m (H) \u00d7 3.0 m (W). The two TPCs in each module are separated by a common cathode made of a stainless steel frame structure supporting punched stainless-steel sheets. The maximal drift length (distance between the cathode and the wire planes), is 1.5 m corresponding to about 1 ms drift time for the nominal drift field of 500 V/cm. The readout electronics are located outside the detector. A Decou-  In 2014 the ICARUS detector was transported to CERN and underwent a significant overhauling. The most important upgrades were: higher-performance TPC readout electronics, the installation of a new scintillation light detection system, the construction of new cold vessels, and the refurbishment of the cryogenics and LAr purification systems. The new TPC readout electronics is hosted in a very compact set-up, with crates mounted directly on top of the signal flanges. The new scintillation light detection system is composed of 360 8\" Hamamatsu R5912-mod PMTs, same as those used in SBND. The detector overhauling process has been concluded with the installation of the two internal detectors, completely refurbished, in the new aluminum vessels at CERN. The two ICARUS modules have then been transported to Fermilab in July 2017. The final placement of the detectors in the SBN far detector building at Fermilab was completed in August 2018 (see Fig. 5, left) and cryogenic plant and detector readout installation are now in progress. Similarly to the near detector, a segmented cosmic ray tagging system composed of plastic scintillation slabs read out by SiPMs will surround the detector in order to mitigate cosmic generated backgrounds. Commissioning of the ICARUS detector at Fermilab is planned for fall 2019.",

Below this are the oscillation probabilities versus neutrino energy at both the near (L = 110 m) and far (L = 600 m) detector locations. Oscillations are visible in the far detectors for all oscillation parameters in the range indicated by global analyses. For larger \u2206m 2 , a small oscillation signal does begin to appear at the lowest neutrino energies in the near detector, but the very different shape and higher level of oscillation at most energies at the far detector preserves the strong sensitivity of the experiment up to several eV 2 .",

Precision oscillation studies in a single detector experiment (6) or even in multi-detector experiments with different near and far detector technologies (47,66) are severely challenged by uncertainties in the neutrino flux and/or the modeling of neutrinonucleus scattering. Uncertainties in the absolute neutrino fluxes and interaction cross sections at BNB energies are also large (10-30%), but the highly correlated event rates in the SBN near and far detectors (since they utilize the same interaction target medium and detection technique) will enable a significant cancellation of the flux and cross section uncertainties when comparing between the two.",

Specifically, photon-induced electromagnetic showers in the MiniBooNE Cherenkov detector are indistinguishable from those induced by an electron, as from charged-current \u03bde scattering. The fine sampling calorimetry of the LArTPC provides multiple handles to separate electron and gamma induced activity. First, a photon will propagate some distance before interacting (X0 = 14 cm in LAr), so if a vertex can be identified, then the gap between the vertex and the start of an electromagnetic shower is a clear photon signature. Second, when the photon converts to produce an e + e \u2212 pair, the resulting ionization in the first few centimeters will be consistent with two minimum ionizing particles (mips), distinguishing it from the single mip deposit of an electron (67).",

The LArTPC is an intrinsically slow technology, with drift times in the millisecond range, so detectors at the surface record significant cosmic activity with each readout (5-15 cosmic muons are seen per readout in the case of the SBN detectors). The SBN near and far detectors, therefore, have been designed to include external cosmic ray tagger detector systems (CRTs) with nearly 4\u03c0 coverage and based on solid scintillator technology to achieve hit timing resolution of a few nanoseconds. In addition, both the near and far detector buildings are designed to support 3 meters of concrete overburden directly above the pits where the detectors are installed. This shielding will absorb more than 99% of the photon and hadron content of cosmic showers hitting the experimental halls. The shielding and CRTs provide a powerful combination for cosmic background mitigation that is essential to the physics goals of SBN.",

Besides, as discussed before, there is a strong tension between the appearance and disappearance data sets. Thus, to show how SBN sensitivity compares to each data set independently, we also present in Fig. 7 the preferred regions for all \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bde appearance data alone (left panel, shaded red) and the limit imposed by all \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance data alone (right panel, black solid line) at 3\u03c3 C.L. from Ref. (33). Notice that SBN alone may be able to rule out almost all the global appearance preferred region at 5\u03c3, while the expected sensitivity on the \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance channel is better than the global constraints for a large range of \u2206m 2 41 . Regardless of the tension between data sets, it is instructive to compare SBN sensitivities to parameter regions that are allowed in a global analysis of all signal and null results from all three oscillation channels, such as in Ref. (35). The 3\u03c3 allowed parameter regions are displayed as the shaded green regions in both panels of Fig. 7. One sees that \u2206m 2 is tightly constrained around 1-2.5 eV 2 in order to satisfy all data, and the severe tension between data sets is manifested as the stretching of the allowed regions in mixing strength. Note that the preferred values of sin 2 2\u03b8\u00b5\u00b5 are necessarily accompanied by non-zero values of sin 2 2\u03b8ee due to non-zero sin 2 2\u03b8\u00b5e, see Eqs. (4)(5)(6) and Ref. 35, suggesting again the complementarity of the reactor neutrino experiments and SBN. Figure 7 shows that SBN has its best sensitivity in the regions of remaining allowed parameter space, in both channels. It is exciting to see how SBN is primed to rule on the possibility of the existence of sterile neutrinos.",

The SBN physics program includes the study of neutrino-argon cross sections with millions of interactions using the well characterized neutrino fluxes of the BNB. Being the near detector, SBND observes the largest flux of neutrinos of the three detectors and provides an ideal venue to conduct precision studies of the physics of neutrino-argon interactions in the GeV energy range. The experiment will collect enormous neutrino event samples and will make the world's highest statistics cross section measurements for many \u03bd-Ar scattering processes. In SBND, more than 2 million neutrino interactions will be collected per year in the full active volume (assuming 2.2\u00d710 20 protons on target), with 1.5 million \u03bd\u00b5 charged-current (CC) events. This will quickly reduce the statistical uncertainty to well below the percent level, making systematic errors dominant. In addition to the large number of \u03bd\u00b5 events, there will be a high statistics \u03bde sample, which will allow for both inclusive and exclusive measurements of electron neutrino interactions. SBND will record around 12,000 \u03bde events per year. Measurements of this interaction will be extremely beneficial for both the SBN and DUNE physics programs. To put the SBND measurements into context of other LAr detectors, each year exposure of SBND will provide an event sample 6-7 times larger than the one available in the full MicroBooNE phase I run. Figure 8 (left) shows the spectra of \u03bd\u00b5 CC and neutral-current (NC) interactions and the total numbers of events expected for an exposure of 6.6 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target (POT). Note that the BNB neutrino flux spectrum at SBND peaks near the neutrino energy of the second oscillation maximum for DUNE (0.8 GeV) and includes a substantial sample up to the first DUNE oscillation maximum (2.6 GeV).

Below we present a summary of new physics scenarios that can potentially be probed at SBN besides the light sterile neutrino framework aforementioned, with a brief description of them and the important signatures in SBN. For each new physics scenario the searches will need to be carefully optimized for the SBN detectors, taking into account the challenge of substantial cosmic activity in LArTPCs operating near the surface. In scenarios where new states are produced in the target (millicharged particles, light dark matter, etc), the Booster Neutrino Beam energy profile will play a crucial role in the experimental sensitivity.

(97,98,99,100)). The left panel of Fig. 9 shows an example of the phenomenology in short-baseline experiments.  Sterile neutrinos and altered dispersion relations (ADR) were proposed as an explanation of the short-baseline anomaly (102). The idea is that additional terms are present in the dispersion relation for eV-scale sterile neutrinos E 2 = | p| 2 + m 2 , like the usual MSW effect, but coming from possible violations of the Lorentz symmetry or extra dimensional setups. In this scenario, the short-baseline anomalies would be explained by active-sterile neutrino oscillations. An energy dependent effective potential, generated by the ADR, weakens the constraints from some high energy experiments like MINOS/MINOS+ and IceCube by reducing the active-sterile mixing. At SBN, this model would have a similar phenomenology to a usual 3+3 sterile scenario.",

Such states, if light enough, can be produced by meson decays via mixing with active neutrinos, propagate to and decay inside the detector (see, e.g. Ref. (103)). Typical decay signatures consist of \u03c0 + \u2212 , \u03bd\u03c0 0 , \u03bd + \u2212 , and \u03bd + \u2212 . If the sterile neutrino is heavy enough, its signal will be slightly delayed with respect to the beam neutrino signal, which can be used to reduce backgrounds. Besides, the angular distribution of some decay products can reveal the Dirac/Majorana character of these heavy states (104).",

Elastic scattering of mCPs with electrons (121), as it proceeds via photon exchange, is enhanced at low electron recoils which can be uniquely probed in LArTPCs (122) (although neutron induced backgrounds are also large). A cleaner way to probe mCPs with much lower backgrounds is by looking at multiple low energy deposition hit events aligned with the beam target (101), see right panel of Fig. 9.

            "text": "In the next few years, the SBN program at Fermilab will provide powerful new input to the question of light sterile neutrinos. Three large precision detectors with the identical nuclear target and same detection technique all sitting in a single neutrino beam allows for a level of control of systematic uncertainties that will be unprecedented in sterile neutrino searches. Furthermore, the experiment is simultaneously sensitive to both \u03bde appearance and \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance oscillation channels, another first and a key ingredient to solving the light sterile neutrino puzzle. Not limited to the sterile neutrino question, SBN has a broad range of physics goals that include detailed, high-statistics studies of neutrino-nucleus scattering (argon specifically, with significant importance for the DUNE experiment in the future) and the exploration of a range of exciting beyond the Standard Model theories that can potentially be tested with SBN data. Finally, SBN is a valuable opportunity for the large international community developing the challenging techniques needed to extract physics information from LArTPC data and that is now making plans to construct and operate these detectors at enormous scales.",

ICARUS was installed in the experimental hall along the beam in August 2018 and is being readied for liquid argon fill by late in 2019. SBND construction is continuing apace with all major detector components currently completed or in production. The TPC components have all arrived to Fermilab where detector assembly, which is done outside of the cryostat, will be completed by fall 2019 and the detector made ready for transport to the near detector hall along the beam. SBND will be ready for argon fill by the end of 2020, officially beginning the era of full SBN program operations.",

SBN uses multiple large liquid argon TPC neutrino detectors, the key to its worldleading sensitivity to oscillations. 3. The SBN detectors are being realized by a large international team of scientists and represent a valuable development platform for this technology, in preparation for the DUNE/LBNF long-baseline program. 4. In addition to sterile neutrinos, the detectors and beams of the SBN program enable a broad science program of neutrino-argon interactions and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.",
