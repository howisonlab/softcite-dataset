The experiment took data from 2008 to 2012 in the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso beam. The observation of the \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 appearance, achieved with four candidate events in a subsample of the data, was previously reported. In this Letter, a fifth \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event, found in an enlarged data sample, is described. Together with a further reduction of the expected background, the candidate events detected so far allow us to assess the discovery of \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations in appearance mode with a significance larger than 5 \u03c3.",

Several experiments on solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrinos have contributed to the understanding of these transitions, referred to as \"neutrino oscillations\" [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In the atmospheric sector, the strong deficit of muon neutrinos observed by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 was the first compelling observation of neutrino oscillations [3][4][5]. This result was later confirmed by the K2K [9] and MINOS experiments [11]. However, for an unambiguous confirmation of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in the atmospheric sector, the detection of oscillated neutrinos in appearance mode was required.",

It has operated under low background conditions and with a signal-to-noise ratio as large as about 10. In 2010, a first \u03bd \u03c4 candidate event was observed [12]. In 2013, the Super-Kamiokande experiment reported evidence for \u03bd \u03c4 appearance in the atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 flux with a signal-to-noise ratio of about one tenth [13]. Since 2013, the detection by the OPERA experiment of three more candidate events reported in Refs. [14][15][16] has allowed us to claim the first observation of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations in appearance mode with a 4.2 \u03c3 significance [16]. In 2014, flavor transition with high purity in appearance mode has also been observed by the T2K experiment in the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e channel [17].",

In the bricks, the momenta of charged particles are measured by their multiple Coulomb scattering in the lead plates [19]. A changeable sheet (CS) doublet consisting of a pair of emulsion films [20] is attached to the downstream face of each brick. The full OPERA target is segmented in about 150 000 bricks arranged in two identical supermodules (SMs). In each SM, the target section is made of 31 walls of ECC bricks. Downstream of each target wall, two orthogonal planes of electronic target trackers (TTs), made of 2.6 cm wide scintillator strips, record the position and deposited energy of charged particles [21]. A spectrometer, consisting of iron core magnets instrumented with resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and drift tubes (precision tracker), is mounted downstream of each target module. The spectrometers are used to identify muons, determine their charge, and measure their momentum with an accuracy of about 20%. A detailed description of the OPERA detector can be found in Ref.

            "text": "A three-dimensional track in the electronic detector is tagged as a muon if the product of its length by the density along its path is larger than 660 g/cm 2 [23]. An event is classified as 1\u00b5 either if it contains at least one track tagged as a muon or if the total number of fired TT and RPC planes is larger than 19. The complementary sample is defined as 0\u00b5. A muon track can be confirmed or discarded by measuring its trajectory all along the  downstream bricks. The momentum-range correlation, the energy loss near the stopping point and, eventually, the tagging of interaction or decay topologies may contribute to assessing the muonic nature of the track beyond the electronic detector performance. The analysis described below is extended to all 0\u00b5 events and to 1\u00b5 events with a muon momentum below 15 GeV/c to reduce the background. The procedure starts with the use of the TT hits pattern to select the bricks possibly containing the neutrino interaction [24]. These bricks are ordered according to their decreasing probability to contain the neutrino interaction vertex. The most probable brick (first brick hereafter) is then extracted from the target. If the neutrino interaction vertex is not found in this brick, it is searched for in the next brick in the probability ranking (second brick hereafter). Once the vertex has been located in a brick, a surrounding volume of about 2 cm 3 is scanned to detect \u03c4 leptons or other short-lived particle decays [25]. The details of the event analysis procedure are described in Ref. [14].",

The systematic uncertainty associated with the signal takes into account contributions from the limited knowledge of the \u03bd \u03c4 cross section and uncertainties on the signal detection efficiency. For the signal central value, the default implementation for the \u03bd \u03c4 cross-section contained in the GENIE v2.6 simulation program is used [31]. A 10% model-related systematic uncertainty can be estimated by considering the maximal deviations from the central value of the expected number of \u03bd \u03c4 candidates obtained when considering all of the available theoretical predictions. The only existing measurement of the \u03bd \u03c4 cross section is a very low-statistics one by the DONUT experiment [32]. Owing to the fact that the \u03bd \u03c4 signal expectation is calculated by using location efficiencies determined from the 1\u00b5 and 0\u00b5 data samples, this value is at first order insensitive to systematic effects on efficiencies up to the primary vertex location level. Further confidence on the global efficiency estimation is obtained by considering the charm data sample for which good agreement is found between the 50 observed events and the expectation (54 \u00b1 4) provided by the neutrinoinduced charm production cross section and the detector simulation [25,33]. Additional uncertainties on the number of expected \u03bd \u03c4 candidates arise from the experimental knowledge of \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 23 (10 %), and from the uncertainty in the efficiency for tagging \u03c4 lepton decays (15%). The latter contribution arises from the statistical error of the sample of \u03bd CC \u00b5 events with charm production which was used for validation. The CNGS flux uncertainty plays a minor role since the expected number of \u03bd \u03c4 events is determined from the detected \u03bd \u00b5 interactions used as a normalisation sample. The simulation of the kinematical properties of the final state was performed using the NEGN generator [34], which takes the polarisation of \u03c4 leptons into account (\u03c4 decay library TAUOLA [35]). The associated systematic uncertainty on the expected number of \u03c4 decays in all channels is estimated at the level of a few percent [36]. The total systematic uncertainty on the expected signal is then set to 20%.",

A Saxon-Woods charge density is assumed with parameters derived from fits to data. Scattering off individual protons is also taken into account. The simulation is benchmarked on experimental data including scattering of 2 GeV/c muons on a 12.6 mm lead target, 7.3 GeV/c and 11.7 GeV/c muons on a 14.4 mm thick copper target and 0.512 GeV/c electrons on a 0.217 mm lead target [39][40][41].
