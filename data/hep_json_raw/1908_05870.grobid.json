The charmonium and charmonium-like states have been intensively studied via the B decays as well as the initial state radiation (ISR) process at Belle, and the bottomonium spectroscopy was investigated by the state transitions. In this review, the study for some charmonium and charmonium-like states and a new measurement of the cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (n = 1, 2, 3) at Belle are reported. Charge-conjugated modes are implied throughout this review.",

Before the first experimental searches, it was expected that B(B + \u2192 h c K + ) \u2248 B(B + \u2192 \u03c7 c0 K + ) [8]. Before our search, the best upper limit was B(B + \u2192 h c K + ) < 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% C.L., which was obtained in the h c search by Belle in 2006 [10]. Although the LHCb collaboration also set the upper limit on the branching fraction product B(B [11], it does not give a stronger constraint since the decay h c \u2192 pp has never been observed and B(h c \u2192 pp) < 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 90% C.L. [9]. After the experimental upper limit of B(B + \u2192 h c K + ) was set, some new theoretical predictions based on different approaches were made. In the QCD factorization approach, the branching fraction is calculated to be 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [12], while using perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach the result is B(B + \u2192 h c K + ) = 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [13]. Both values are slightly below the previous experimental upper limit. In our analysis, both charged and neutral B's are considered.

The current upper limit for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 is 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 90% confidence level [9]. Possible new physics enhancements of the branching fractions for such decay may be due to right-handed currents [23] or nonspectator intrinsic charm in B 0 [25]. Since X(3872) may not be a pure charmonium state, the branching fraction of B 0 \u2192 X(3872)\u03b3 should be smaller than that of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3. This is the first search of the decay B 0 \u2192 X(3872)\u03b3.

Although the electron widths of the D-wave states are expected to be quite small for bottomonia below the BB threshold [47], they can be significantly enhanced above the open-flavor thresholds due to B-meson loops [48]. Furthermore, recent study of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in Belle show a small hint of new structure at \u221a s = 10.77 GeV [49].

The \u03d2(10860) on-resonance data samples with a total luminosity of 121 fb \u22121 are also used, and they were collected in five different periods with slightly different c.m. energies between 10.864 GeV and 10.868 GeV. Finally, we use the continuum data sample collected at 10.52 GeV with a total luminosity of 60 fb \u22121 . Signal yields are extracted via fitting to the M recoil (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution, instead of the counting method used in the previous study [49]. Additional information about the cross section shapes are obtained by using the ISR process with the high statistics \u03d2(10860) on-resonance data.

Furthermore, we observed a new structure in the energy dependence, with a global significance of 6.7\u03c3 including the systematic uncertainties. Such new structure may be explained by resonances of the not-yet-observed \u03d2(3D) (enhancement of S-D mixing) [48] or an exotic state (e.g. a compact tetraquark [43] or hadrobottomonium [44]). It may also be a non-resonant effect due to some complicated rescattering. Measurements of \u03d2(10860) and \u03d2(11020) parameters with improved accuracy are also reported. In the continuum data sample at \u221a s = 10.52 GeV, a clear signal for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process is evident.
