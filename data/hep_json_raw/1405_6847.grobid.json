            "text": "The OPERA experiment [1], located at the Gran Sasso laboratory (LNGS), aims at observing the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 neutrino oscillation in the direct appearance mode in the CERN neutrino to Gran Sasso (CNGS) [2,3] beam by detecting the decay of the \u03c4 produced in charged current (CC) interactions. A detailed description of the detector can be found in [1,4,5,6,7,8,9]. The OPERA detector consists of two identical Super Modules (SM), each of them consisting of a target area and a muon spectrometer, as shown in Fig. 1. The target area consists of alternating layers of scintillator strip planes and target walls. The muon spectrometer is used to reconstruct and identify muons from \u03bd \u00b5 -CC interactions and estimate their momentum and charge.  The target walls are trays in which target units of 10 \u00d7 12.5cm 2 and a depth of 10 X 0 in lead (7.9 cm) with a mass of around 10 kg each are stored: they are also refered to as bricks. A brick is formed by alternating layers of lead plates and emulsion films (2 emulsion layers separated by a plastic base) building an emulsion cloud chamber (ECC). This provides high granularity and high mass, which is ideal for \u03bd \u03c4 interaction detection. Fig. 3 left shows an image of the unwrapped ECC brick. On the right, the arrangement of the scintillator strip planes (Target Tracker, TT) and the ECC is shown. Note an extra pair of emulsion films in a removable box called a changeable sheet (CS), shown in blue. The total mass of each target area is about 625 tons, leading to a target mass of 1.25 ktons for 145'000 bricks. ",

After a positive CS result, the ECC will be unpacked and the emulsion films are developed and sent to one of the various scanning stations in Japan and Europe. Dedicated automatic scanning systems allow us to follow the tracks from the CS prediction up to their stopping point. Around these stopping points, a volume of 1 cm 2 times 15 emulsion films will be scanned to find the interaction vertex. As illustrated in Fig. 4, only track segments in the active emulsion volume are visible and a reconstruction of the event is needed to find tracks and vertices. A dedicated procedure, called a \"decay search\" is used to search for possibly interesting topologies, like the \u03c4 -decay pictured in Fig. 4. The accuracy of the track reconstruction goes from cm in the electronic detector, down to mm for the CS analysis and to micrometric precision in the final vertex reconstruction (after aligning the ECC emulsion plates with passing-through cosmicray tracks).",

The background due to charm can be reduced by identifying the muon at the primary vertex, as charm will occur primarily in \u03bd \u00b5 -CC interactions (for further details see [8,10]).

They were all attributed to be hadrons, and no soft muon (E < 2 GeV) was found. In 2010, the expected total number of \u03c4 candidates was 0.9, while the expected background was less than 0.1 events. More details on the analysis are presented in [8].

Charmed particles have lifetimes similar to the \u03c4 and similar decay channels. Thus charm events provide a subsample of decay topologies similar to \u03c4 decay, for which the detection efficiency can be estimated based on MC simulation. A study of a high purity selection of charm events in 2008 and 2009 shows agreement with the data [12]. One-prong charm decay candidates are retained if the charged daughter particle has a momentum larger than 1 GeV/c. This leads to an efficiency of short = 0.31 \u00b1 0.02(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.) for short and long = 0.61\u00b10.05(stat.)\u00b10.06(syst.) for long charm decays, wherein 'long' means the production and the decay vertices are not located in the same lead plate. The number of events for which the charm search is complete is 2167 CC interactions. In these we expect 51\u00b17.5 charm candidates, with a background of 5.3 \u00b1 2.3 events. The number of observed candidates is 49, which is in agreement with expectations. Figure 8: Display of one of the charm events. Top: View of the reconstructed event in the emulsion. Bottom: Zoom in the vertex region of the primary and secondary vertex. Fig. 8 shows a charm decay detected in the OPERA experiment. In the electronic detector reconstruction, two muons were observed, one charged positively, the other negatively. The \u00b5 \u2212 is attached to the primary vertex, while the \u00b5 + is connected to the decay vertex. This topology corresponds with a charged charm decaying into a muon and the measured kinematic parameters are a flight length of 1330 \u00b5m and a kink angle of 209 mrad. The impact parameter (IP) of the \u00b5 + with respect to the primary vertex is 262 \u00b5m, and its momentum is measured as 2.2 GeV/c. This accounts for a transverse momentum (P T ) of 0.46 GeV/c.",

As a result, the electronic detector provides a time signal of the recorded events, which can be used to measure the neutrino velocity in the CNGS beam. One needs to measure with precision of some ns the flight time (time of flight -TOF) between CERN and LNGS, and the distance between reference points in the detector and the CNGS. The concept of the neutrino time of flight measurement is illustrated in Fig. 9. The procedures are explained in great detail in [13]. Since the time of the conference, an instrumental mistake has been identified that makes the results presented at this conference obsolete. Updated results taken from [14] are presented below.   10 shows the timing systems both at CERN and LNGS, which allowed time calibration between both sites within accuracy of \u00b14 ns.",

In arxiv.org1110:4781, I pointed out the need for a 2-parameter analysis for causal matched filtering, to accuarately determine the TOF. The results show a reduction to 3.75 \u03c3 from the OPERA claim of 6.04 \u03c3, demonstrating the need for a careful analysis. Will OPERA make its data public, and will OPERA pursue proper casual matching filtering on the 10.5 \u00b5s experiment?",

The data is available to the public in the RAW format, and a guideline for setting up the timelink calibration has been developed together with CERN. As for the matched filtering, this question will be forwarded to the person responsible for the neutrino velocity analysis. Addendum (Statement from the Collaboration): The 2-parameter analysis has been debated at length. It is clear that by introducing a new degree of freedom (the length of the bunch) one may obtain a better result, as Putten actually obtains. However this corresponds to a possible new unknown physical property of neutrinos. To be conservative about the measurement in September, OPERA has chosen to exclude any debate on the possible physical source of the result.",
