Meanwhile, the studies of indirect probes of BSM physics, with all their diversity, have been progressing both in accuracy and in setting up observables with reduced theoretical uncertainties. The observation of flavour anomalies in b hadron decays represents an important part of the program of indirect detection of BSM physics. Several benchmark analyses involving leptonic or semileptonic decays are presented, with an emphasis on intriguing patterns which are systematic in their trend, though not individually significant yet.",

            "text": "The current state-of-the-art of the anomalies in the b hadron decays has not converged yet to an individual measurement reaching the observation level of an involvement of BSM physics. The combination of the observed deviations has nevertheless triggered an intense activity on the phenomenological side in studies aiming at constraining the Wilson coefficients and probing possible contributions of New Physics [15,18,19]. The analysis of the late Run 2 data and the coming Run 3 data taking at LHC will be crucial to establish or infirm the observed anomalies. Furthermore, as those anomalies involve lepton flavour, a strengthening of the connection with neutrino physics is desirable [20,21].",
