The data sample used in this search was collected by the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centreof-mass energy of 8 TeV produced by the LHC. The search features novel background suppression and prediction methods, including a dedicated top quark pair reconstruction algorithm. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted backgrounds. Exclusion limits are set in simplified supersymmetry models with the top squark decaying to jets and an undetected neutralino, either through a top quark or through a bottom quark and chargino. Models with the top squark decaying via a top quark are excluded for top squark masses up to 755 GeV in the case of neutralino masses below 200 GeV. For decays via a chargino, top squark masses up to 620 GeV are excluded, depending on the masses of the chargino and neutralino.",

Nevertheless, the existence of dark matter [1][2][3] inferred from astrophysical observations, together with a wide array of theoretical considerations, all point to the likelihood of physics beyond the SM. New physics could be in the vicinity of the electroweak (EW) scale and accessible to experiments at the CERN LHC [4]. In addition, the recent discovery of a Higgs boson [5][6][7] at a mass of 125 GeV [8][9][10] has meant that the hierarchy problem, also known as the 'fine-tuning' or 'naturalness' problem [11][12][13][14][15][16], is no longer hypothetical.",

In particular, a SUSY particle (generically referred to as a 'sparticle' or 'superpartner') is proposed for each SM particle. A sparticle is expected to have the same couplings and quantum numbers as its SM counterpart with the exception of spin, which differs by a half-integer. Spin-1/2 SM fermions (quarks and leptons) are thus paired with spin-0 sfermions (the squarks and sleptons). There is a similar, but slightly more complicated pairing for bosons; SUSY models have extended Higgs sectors that contain neutral and charged higgsinos that mix with the SUSY partners of the neutral and charged EW gauge bosons, respectively. The resulting mixed states are referred to as neutralinos \u03c7 0 and charginos \u03c7 \u00b1 .",

            "text": "Supersymmetry protects the mass of the Higgs boson against divergent quantum corrections associated with virtual SM particles by providing cancellations via the corresponding corrections for virtual superpartners [22][23][24][25]. Since no sparticles have been observed to date, they are generally expected to be more massive than their SM counterparts. On the other hand, sparticle masses cannot be arbitrarily large if they are to stabilise the Higgs boson mass without an unnatural level of fine-tuning. This is particularly important for the partners of the third generation SM particles that have large Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson [26][27][28][29]. The top and bottom squarks ( t and b), are expected to be among the lightest sparticles and potentially the most accessible at the LHC, especially when all other constraints are taken into consideration [27,30]. With conservation of R-parity [31,32], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable. If the lightest weakly interacting neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ) is the stable LSP, it is a leading candidate for dark matter [33]. Based upon these considerations, it is of particular interest at the LHC to look for evidence of the production of t t with decay chains of the t and t ending in SM particles and LSPs. The latter do not interact with material in the detector and so must have their presence inferred from missing transverse momentum p miss T , which in each event is defined as the projection of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles onto the plane perpendicular to the beam line. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . Within the Simplified Model Spectra (SMS) framework [34][35][36] the study presented here considers two broad classes of signals that lead to a bbqqqq + E miss T final state via decay modes denoted T2tt and T2bW. These are defined, respectively, as (i) t decay to a top quark: t \u2192 t \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 bW + \u03c7 0 1 , and (ii) t decay via a chargino: t \u2192 b \u03c7 + \u2192 bW + \u03c7 0 1 . Figure 1 shows the diagrams representing these two simplified models. The two decay modes are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for one of the top squarks to decay as in T2tt and the other as in T2bW. However, such a scenario is not considered in the analysis presented here.",

The polarization of the t decay products depends on the properties of the SUSY model, such as the left and right t mixing [37,38]. Instead of choosing a specific model, each SMS scenario is assumed to have unpolarized decay products and has a 100 % branching ratio to the final state under consideration. As such, the results can be interpreted, with appropriately rescaled branching fractions, in the context of any SUSY model in which these decays are predicted to occur.",

            "text": "With event characteristics of these signals in mind, we have developed a search for pair production of top squarks with decays that result in a pair of LSPs in the final state in addition to SM particles. Two selection criteria address the desire to extract a potentially very small signal from a sample dominated by top quark pair events. The first criterion comes from the E miss T signature associated with the LSPs, which motivates the focus on all-hadronic final states, as this eliminates large sources of SM background events with genuine E miss T from neutrinos in leptonic W decays. The all-hadronic final state with E miss T constitutes 45 % of the signal because W bosons decay to quarks with a 67 % branching ratio. For the same reason this final state makes up an even higher proportion of the subset of events with high jet multiplicity including many jets with high transverse momentum, p T , that is often required in SUSY searches to eliminate SM backgrounds. The second criterion relies upon the identification of top quark decay products to eliminate such backgrounds as SM production of W bosons in association with jets. Together, these criteria define a preselection region consisting of events that pass stringent vetoes on the presence of charged leptons, and are required to have large E miss T , two tagged b quark jets, and four additional jets from the hadronisation and decay of light quarks.",

            "text": "In spite of these stringent requirements, the low production cross sections of new physics signals mean that they are easily overwhelmed by SM backgrounds. In the case of SUSY, for example, the cross section for the production of top squark pairs with m t = 800 GeV is predicted to be nearly five orders of magnitude smaller than that of top quark pairs [39]. For this reason, this analysis focuses heavily on background suppression, employing several new methods that improve sensitivity to signal. The relevant SM processes contributing to this analysis fall into four main categories: (i) top quark and W boson events where the W decays leptonically, thereby contributing genuine E miss T , but the lepton is not successfully reconstructed or identified, or it is outside the acceptance of the detector; (ii) invisible decays of the Z boson when produced in association with jets, Z+jets with Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd; (iii) QCD multijet production, which, due to its very high rate, can produce events with substantial E miss T in the very rare cases of either extreme mismeasurements of jet momenta or the leptonic decay of heavy-flavour hadrons with large neutrino p T ; and (iv) ttZ production (with Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd), which is an irreducible background to signals with top squark decays via on-shell top quarks. The ttZ process has a small cross section that has been measured by ATLAS and CMS to be 176 +58 \u221252 fb \u22121 [40] and 242 +65 \u221255 fb \u22121 [41], respectively. The first step in developing the search is the construction of a set of optimised vetoes for all three lepton flavours that reduce SM backgrounds for both signal types. Next, specific features of each signal type are exploited by combining several variables in a multivariate analysis (MVA) based upon Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). For T2tt, a high performance hadronic top quark decay reconstruction algorithm is developed and used to facilitate discrimination of signal from background by using details of top quark kinematics.",

The energy of a photon is obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero suppression effects. For an electron the energy is determined from a combination of its estimated momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track [76]. Muon momentum is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Charged hadrons associated with vertices other than the primary vertex, defined as the pp interaction vertex with the largest sum of charged-track p 2 T values, are not considered. Finally, the energies of neutral hadrons are obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies.",

An offset correction determined for each jet via the average p T density per unit area and the jet area is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from pileup, defined as the additional protonproton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings [70]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulated events and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions [79].",

            "text": "Top quark taggers are typically characterized by high efficiencies for the reconstruction of all-hadronic decays of top quarks that have been Lorentz boosted to sufficiently high momentum for their final state partons and associated showers to form a single collimated jet. Such taggers are not ideal for the regions of parameter space targeted by this search because the top quarks from top squark decays can experience a wide range of boosts in these regions and it is not uncommon for one of the top quarks to have a boost that is too low to produce such a coalescence of final-state objects. An additional problem arises with traditional jet algorithms that do not always distinguish two separate clusters of particles whose separation is smaller than their fixed distance parameter or cone radius. In addition, for lowp T jets and those originating from hadronisation of b quarks, it is not unusual for algorithms with fixed distance metrics to miss some of the particles that should be included in the jet. These issues are addressed by making use of a variable jet-size clustering algorithm that is capable of successfully resolving six jets in the decays of top quark pairs with efficiency ranging between 25 % in the case of signal with compressed mass splitting (m t = 400 GeV \u2248 m t +m \u03c7 0 1 +75 GeV) to 40 % in the case of large mass splitting (m t = 750 GeV \u2248 m t +m \u03c7 0 1 +550 GeV). The algorithm starts by clustering jets with the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [96,97] with a distance parameter of 1.0 in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane to produce what will be referred to as proto-jets. Studies based on MC simulation show that this parameter value is large enough to capture partons with p T as low as 20 GeV. Each proto-jet is then considered for division into a pair of subjets. The N-subjettiness metric [98], \u03c4 N , is used to determine the relative compatibility of particles in a proto-jet with a set of \"N\" jet axes. It is defined as the p T -weighted sum of the distances of proto-jet constituents to the nearest jet axis, resulting in lower values when the particles are clustered near jet axes and higher values when they are more widely dispersed.

In our case, the axes are varied in the vicinity of the initial set until a local minimum in the value of \u03c4 2 is found.

First, BDTs are trained to discriminate the highest p T jet coming from a top quark decay from all other jets in the event using input variables related to jet kinematics, b tagging discrimination and jet composition information. Jets are labelled as seed jets if they have an associated discriminator value that exceeds a high efficiency cutoff value.

Sensitivity to signal is therefore improved by identifying and rejecting events with charged leptons originating from prompt W boson decays as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, signal events often contain charged leptons that arise from decays of heavy flavour hadrons or charged hadrons that have been misidentified as charged leptons. It is advantageous to retain these events in order to achieve high signal efficiency. In events with E miss T > 175 GeV and five or more jets, the standard CMS lepton identification algorithms operating at their tightest working points [71,76] can identify semileptonic tt events with efficiencies of 54 and 60 % for final states involving electrons and muons, respectively. This analysis makes use of MVA techniques to achieve higher efficiencies for the identification and rejection of semileptonic tt events, while retaining high signal efficiency.",

The non-prompt lepton selection efficiency in signal events is similar to that in tt events. The top plot in Fig. 6 shows the selection efficiency, by lepton type, for non-prompt leptons as a function of that for prompt leptons in the BDT training samples. The curves are obtained by varying the cutoff on the corresponding BDT discriminator value above which events are accepted. In this analysis, the discriminator values that are chosen have efficiencies of 98 % for events with electrons and muons from W boson decays that pass the preselection requirements, while incorrectly selecting no more than 5 % of all-hadronic tt events. The latter gives some indication of the expected loss of all-hadronic top squark signal events.

The \u03c4 identification algorithm focuses on decays involving a single charged hadron in conjunction with neutral hadrons because the majority of hadronic \u03c4 decays are to final states of this type, which are often referred to as 'one-prong' decays. No attempt is made to specifically reconstruct the sub-dominant 'three-prong' decays. A \u03c4 candidate is thus defined by a track and a nearby electromagnetic cluster produced by the photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay, if present, in order to include more of the visible energy from the \u03c4 lepton decay. Since every charged particle with p T > 5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 could be considered to be a \u03c4 candidate, we reduce the pool of candidates by using m T calculated from p miss T and the momentum of each candidate. As seen in the bottom plot in Fig. 6, the m T distribution for genuine \u03c4 candidates has an endpoint at the mass of the W boson for semileptonic tt events, reflecting the fact that the neutrinos associated with W boson and \u03c4 lepton decays are the largest source of E miss T in these events.

The signal space of the T2tt simplified model is parameterised by the masses of the top squark and the neutralino. The T2bW simplified model also includes an intermediate chargino, and is therefore parameterised by three masses. For each model, a large set of simulated event samples is prepared, corresponding to a grid of mass points in two dimensions for T2tt, and in three dimensions for T2bW. A large set of moderately to strongly discriminating variables, discussed in more detail below, serves as input to each BDT to yield a single discriminator value ranging between \u22121.0 and +1.0 for each event considered.

To this end, a minimum number of BDTs that provides sufficient coverage of each signal space is selected from a larger superset that includes BDTs that are each uniquely trained on grid points separated by \u2248100 GeV in top squark mass and \u224850 GeV in neutralino mass for both signal types. For T2bW, there are also 3 different values of chargino mass that are considered, corresponding to x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Sensitivity to signal is probed by varying discriminator thresholds from 0.5 to 1.0 in steps of 0.01. Ultimately it is determined that four BDTs for T2tt and five for T2bW are adequate to cover the largest possible parameter space with near optimal signal sensitivity. Each BDT tends to cover a specific portion of signal space, referred to as a search region. The optimisation of the overall search does not depend strongly on the specific sig- Table 2 Search regions for the T2tt and T2bW channels. The table lists the SUSY particle masses used for the training of the BDTs, the cutoff on the BDT output, and the efficiency for the signal to pass the BDT selection relative to the baseline selection. The event counts of the T2bW discriminator training samples are limited and so four nearby mass points were used. They are the four combinations of the two t and two \u03c7 0 1 masses listed. The signal efficiency in each row of the table is then that of the best case of the four, which in every case is the point with the largest m t and smallest m nal points that are used to train individual BDTs. Moreover, adding more regions is not found to increase the sensitivity of the analysis. Table 2 lists the search regions for both signal types, the mass parameter points used to train each BDT, and the optimal BDT discriminator cutoffs that are used to define the final samples. Figure 7 displays the most sensitive search regions in T2tt and selected T2bW mass planes. The colour plotted in any given partition of the plane corresponds to the search region BDT with the strongest expected limit on the signal production cross section. For the T2tt search a total of 24 variables are used. They can be divided into variables that do or do not rely upon top quark pair reconstruction by the corral algorithm. The latter include E miss T , jet multiplicity, and m T calculated with p miss T and the p T of the b-tagged picky jet that is closest to p miss T in \u03c6. Of these, the most important variables for tt suppression are E miss T and m T . The m T distribution is peaked near the top quark mass for semileptonic tt events because nearly all of the E miss T originates from the leptonic W decay, and the corresponding lepton is usually soft. On the other hand, there is no peak in the distribution for fully hadronic signal events. One variable suppresses SM background by exploiting the higher probability for jets in SM events, particularly Z+jets and W+jets, to originate from gluons. It is the product of the quark-gluon likelihood values [104] that are computed for each jet in the event. Two additional variables, the \u03b7 of the peak in jet activity and the \u0394\u03b7 between two peaks in jet activity, provide a measure of the centrality of the event activity. They are obtained by a kernel density estimate (KDE) [105,106] of the one dimensional jet p T density. The KDE uses the jet \u03b7 as input with a jet p T weighted gaussian kernel function and a bandwidth parameter optimized on an event by event basis such that two peaks in the KDE are found. Another variable counts the number of unique combinations of jets that can form reconstructed top quark pairs. The remaining seventeen variables are all built with information pertaining to the candidate top quark pair obtained from corral. The invariant mass of the top quark pair and the relative p T of the two reconstructed top quarks are used to take into account correlations between the two top quark candidates that generally differ for signal and background. The degree of boost or collimation of each top quark candidate is measured with three variables, including the minimum cone size in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane that contains all of the reconstructed particles from the top quark decay. Two variables use the corral discriminator value for each of the two top quarks as a measure of the quality of the reconstruction. Two other variables measure the angular correlation with p miss T for the lower-quality member of the top quark pair. The last eight variables are the p T values for the six jets in the top quark pair and two CSV b jet discriminator values that each correspond to the highest b tagging discriminator value obtained for the three jets that make up each of the two top quark candidates. While the properties of the reconstructed top quark pairs differ between signal events with two hadronic top decays and all SM background events with one or no hadronic top decays, the variables measuring the quality of the reconstruction are particularly useful for the suppression of Z+jets and W+jets since no reconstructed top quark candidates originate from hadronic top decays. A similar situation occurs for the variables utilizing b jet discriminator values since these processes typically have fewer jets that originate from b quarks than signal processes. As explained in Sect. 4, the kinematics of the reconstructed top quarks, such as their angular correlation with p miss T , are used for tt suppression.",

As discussed in Sect. 7.1, the scale factors are extracted from data-MC comparisons in control regions. The reweighting of the events assures that the simulation samples match data samples with regard to distributions of quantities that are relevant to the selection of events in the signal regions. However, it is important to note that the reweighted MC samples are not used directly to estimate backgrounds in the signal region. Rather, the search region yields and uncertainties are estimated by comparing the reweighted MC samples to data in background-specific control regions that differ from the search regions only in that they are obtained with selection criteria that simultaneously increase the purity of a single background and reduce any potential signal contamination. In the case of the EW backgrounds the control regions are selected by requiring one or more isolated leptons, while for the QCD multijet background it is selected by requiring p miss T to be aligned with one of the leading jets.",

            "text": "This analysis uses MC samples as the basis for the estimation of SM backgrounds in signal regions. These simulations have been extensively tested and tuned in CMS since the start of LHC data taking in 2009. As a result, they accurately reproduce effects related to the detailed geometry and material content of the apparatus, as well as those related to physics processes such as initial-state and final-state radiation. Nevertheless, the MC samples are not assumed to be perfect, discrepancies being observed with data in some kinematic regions. Comparisons between data and MC simulation are therefore performed to derive scale factors in order to reduce the observed discrepancies. The scale factors fall into two conceptually different categories. The first category involves effects associated with detector modelling and object reconstruction that are manifested as discrepancies in jet and E miss T energy scales and resolutions, lepton and b jet reconstruction efficiencies, and trigger efficiencies. The second category corresponds to discrepancies associated with theoretical modelling of the physics processes as represented by differential cross sections in collision events. The scale factors in this category are estimated separately for each SM background process. The main sources of discrepancy here are finite order approximations in matrix element calculations and phenomenological models for parton showering and hadronisation. Scale factors are parameterised as a function of generator-level quantities controlling post-simulation event characteristics relevant to the final selection criteria used in the analysis. The scale factors are derived by comparing distributions of variables after full reconstruction that are particularly sensitive to these generator-level quantities, as seen in comparisons of MC with data. D'Agostini unfolding with up to four iterations [107], implemented with RooUnfold [108], is used to determine the correct normalization of the generator-level quantities such that the distributions agree after full reconstruction. The scale factors are defined as the ratio of the corrected values of generator-level quantities to their original values. The MC events are reweighted by these scale factors, thereby eliminating any observed discrepancies with data. The scale factors are generally found to be close to unity as a result of the high quality of the MC simulation. The inclusive kinematic scale factors lead to no more than 10 % shifts in any regions of the distributions of H T and number of jets that are relevant to this analysis.",

Both use the CSV b tagging algorithm output values directly rather than setting a particular cutoff value as is done for standard CMS loose, medium, and tight working points [80]. It is therefore important that the CSV discriminator output distributions in simulated event samples match those seen in corresponding data samples. To this end, the CSV discriminator output of each picky jet is corrected so that the CSV output distributions for simulated tt and Z+jets event samples match those observed in the inclusive tt and Z+jets control samples, respectively. Similarly, the quark-gluon likelihood distribution for jets is corrected to match data. The jet energy scale is corrected as described in Sect. 3, and the simulated picky jet p T spectrum is corrected as described in Sect. 4. The rejection of SM backgrounds in this analysis is very much dependent on the measurement of p miss T and its resolution, which is not modelled perfectly in simulation. Corrections are therefore applied to MC simulated samples of EW and QCD multijet processes in order to obtain good agreement with data in search region variables that depend on the correlation of event activity with p miss T . There are three separate corrections [110] applied for EW processes that are derived from a control sample of Z+jets events with Z \u2192 + \u2212 where, by conservation of energy and momentum, the reconstructed Z boson provides an accurate measure of the energy associated with all other activity in the event as measured in the transverse plane. Sources of genuine E miss T such as neutrinos in these events are rare and have a negligible effect on the derived corrections. The corrections are based upon comparisons of data to simulation in the inclusive Z+jets control sample in which p miss T is decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the Z boson \u2192 p T . The components and their resolutions are then investigated as a function of a variety of quantities to look for systematic trends and biases that can then be corrected. In this way, an E miss T scale correction of order 1 % is obtained as a function of both the boson p T and the distribution of hadronic energy in the event relative to the energy of the boson. The second and third corrections involve an increase in the jet resolution by 9 % and a smearing of the p miss T in both the directions parallel to the boson and perpendicular to it by approximately 4.5 GeV. The measured resolutions of the components of p miss T along and perpendicular to the boson direction as obtained in simulation match those found in the data control regions after these corrections are applied.",

This level of agreement is also found for distributions of many kinematic variables for which no corrections were explicitly applied. There are a few regions in which kinematic distributions disagree at the level of 20 %, but these disagreements have been found to have a negligible impact on the search region predictions. A bootstrapping procedure is used [111] to take into account statistical uncertainties in the derived scale factors for distributions of kinematic quantities and their correlations. The corresponding statistical uncertainty in the search region predictions is labelled \"Kinematics reweighting\" in Tables 3 and 4. While the corrected MC and data distributions are found to agree in many control regions, the corrected MC is not used to directly estimate the background in the search regions.

            "text": "After correcting MC simulation samples for detector, reconstruction, and kinematic discrepancies, a closure correction and its uncertainty are measured, where closure is defined as the largest residual data-MC difference seen in a number of kinematic distributions. To this end, data-MC comparisons are performed in a variety of leptonic control regions for which the kinematic distributions under study are as similar as possible to those in the search regions as seen for MC samples that pass the signal selection criteria. The leptonic control samples used for the closure tests are obtained by applying the full set of baseline requirements, with the exception of the lepton vetoes. The control samples used to correct the tt, W+jets and single top processes, referred to as the \"1 closure samples,\" are subsets of the inclusive tt control sample, in which exactly one charged lepton has been identified. The charged lepton is removed from the list of physics objects in the event, leading to an additional component of p miss T that simulates the case in which the W boson decay has a large invisible component, which is common for events passing the search region selection. As a result, many events with low intrinsic E miss T pass the search region selection criteria, thereby enhancing the data statis- Comparisons of the BDT discriminator outputs for data and corrected MC simulation for the 1 closure samples, after removal of the single identified charged lepton in each event, are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, with the first ten bins in each plot covering the full BDT discriminator range. The closure is quantified by comparing the predicted event counts in MC simulation to those found in data in a 'validation region', defined as the region containing the events with a single lepton that pass all of the final signal selection criteria after the lepton is removed, and in two control regions that extend the final search region to lower BDT discriminator values. The latter are defined by doubling and tripling the difference between unity and the discriminator cutoff value used for the final search region. These two additional regions are  needed because the search region is statistically limited in some cases. The results for the signal region and the two extended regions are shown in the last three bins in Figs.  8 and 9, for the four T2tt and five T2bW BDT discriminators, respectively. The differences seen in the event counts for data and MC simulation in the extended regions are in general statistically compatible with the difference seen in the search region. Therefore, the data over simulation ratio in the first extended region is used as a correction for any potential residual bias in the event counts obtained with MC samples in which the events pass all of the signal region selection criteria, now including the lepton veto requirements. The uncertainty in the correction is taken to be the statistical uncertainty in the data over simulation ratio in the last bin, which we have referred to as the validation region. This choice assures that the uncertainty covers any potential unknown differences between the search region and the first extended search region. For the four separate T2tt search regions, the largest correction is 1.08 \u00b1 0.13 in the medium-mass region, with the closure uncertainties ranging from \u00b10.08 in the lowmass region to \u00b10.24 in the very-high-mass region. For the five separate T2bW search regions, the largest correction is 0.85 \u00b1 0.20, and the uncertainties in the corrections range from \u00b10.09 to \u00b10.25. This uncertainty in the search region predictions is denoted as \"Closure (1 )\" in Tables 3 and 4. The simulated data are similarly compared to data in the 2 closure samples in Figs. 10 and 11. No statistically significant lack of closure is observed for any of the T2tt and T2bW search regions. However, the small sample size makes it impossible to probe comparisons near to the search regions. An uncertainty is therefore obtained by measuring the largest data-MC discrepancy for each individual MVA input variable in the kinematic phase space of the search regions. This is defined for each input variable and search region as the ratio of event yields in data relative to MC simulation after reweighting both distributions. The weights that are used come from MC simulated distributions of the input variables after applying the MVA discriminator cutoff that is used for the search region. The distributions are normalised to unit area and the normalised bin contents are the final weights. The weights are applied to binned events in both samples before taking the data/MC ratio in the control region where we measure the uncertainty. The uncertainty in the Z+jets background prediction is then taken to be the difference with respect to unity of this ratio for the variable with the largest degree of nonclosure, defined as |(Data/MC) \u2212 1|/\u03c3 where \u03c3 is the statistical uncertainty in the ratio. This closure test is repeated with successively tighter MVA discriminator cutoffs to check if the extracted closure uncertainty has any potential systematic trend related to discriminator cutoff. No significant trend is observed. To be conservative, the nonclosure is measured for an MVA discriminator value greater than or equal to 0.0 (\u22120.5) for T2tt (T2bW) search regions. These cutoff values are the highest ones for which the magnitude of the statistical uncertainty is smaller than the measured level of nonclosure. The uncertainties, denoted as \"Closure (2 )\" in Tables 3 and 4, are found to range between 16 % and  39 %. A separate control sample, which is similar to the baseline selection but with relaxed jet and b-tag requirements, is studied as an independent check of the Z+jets and W+jets processes. Discrepancies of roughly 5 % in the event counts relative to those predicted are observed for both the Z+jets and W+jets processes. The full magnitude of this discrepancy is taken as an additional uncertainty in the event counts for these background processes and it is included as \"Closure (relaxed baseline)\" in Tables 3 and 4.",

The discrepancy is traced to a mismodelling of m T , which, as discussed in Sect. 5, is used for a preselection requirement of the tau veto. The mismodelling of m T is due to the angular component of p miss T and is uncorrelated with its magnitude. To address this, a correction and associated uncertainty are determined by means of a control region made up of modified events that is safe from signal contamination. The control region is defined by applying the full search region selection criteria to events in which search region discriminator values are calculated with a E miss T value that is randomly selected from the distribution of E miss T values obtained for the search region in MC simulation. A \u03c4 lepton veto efficiency is then obtained separately in data and simulation by taking the ratio of the number of events that pass the full set of signal region selection criteria but fail the \u03c4 lepton veto to the total number of events that pass the selection criteria prior to applying the \u03c4 lepton veto. The ratio of the \u03c4 lepton efficiency in data to the efficiency in simulation is then used to correct the efficiency for the simulated background samples with \u03c4 leptons from W boson decays in the signal region. This correction reduces the data-MC discrepancy to a level that is not statistically significant and decreases the simulated \u03c4 lepton efficiency by a maximum of 29 % in all cases considered, with an uncertainty of 13 %. This uncertainty is included with the other lepton selection scale factor uncertainties under the label of \"MVA lepton sel. scale factors\" in Tables 3 and 4.",

This means that the QCD multijet background cannot be estimated precisely and so a reliable upper bound is found instead. This is sufficient because the QCD multijet contribution is small compared to other backgrounds. To this end, simulation samples having sources of large E miss T are compared with E miss T -triggered data in control regions to obtain scale factors and associated uncertainties that are used to reweight simulated events.

The two charged leptons picked up by these triggers most often originate from the decay of a Z boson and are thus oppositely charged, sameflavour leptons. The third lepton can arise via the semileptonic decay of a W coming from the decay of a top quark in ttZ events. The selection of events for this control sample thus includes the requirement that two of the reconstructed leptons must be consistent with the expectations for leptons from Z boson decay in flavour, charge, and the invariant mass of the pair. In order to reduce the contamination from other SM backgrounds, events are also required to have at least three or more jets, at least six picky jets, and one or more b-jets tagged with the medium CSV working point [80] in order to increase the relative contribution of the ttZ process.",

This is adopted as a systematic uncertainty in the estimated yield of this background source and is denoted as \"MC normalisation\" in Tables 3  and 4. A final systematic uncertainty takes into account differences observed between the kinematic distributions in MC simulation and data. To this end, we make use of the closure uncertainties in the W+jets (including tt and single top) and Z+jets background predictions that have been derived in the lepton control regions as necessitated by the lack of an appropriate ttZ data control sample. The maximum estimated uncertainty found for either of the two processes is taken to be the uncertainty in the modelling of the kinematics for the ttZ process.

Systematic uncertainties in the signal selection efficiencies are assessed as a function of the t and \u03c7 0 1 masses, and as a function of the mass splitting parameter x in the case of the T2bW signal. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES) has the largest impact on signal yield, followed by the b tagging efficiency uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with the parton distribution functions is evaluated by follow- ing the recommendation of the PDF4LHC group [113][114][115][116][117]. Uncertainties in the jet energy resolution, initial-state radiation, and integrated luminosity [73] are also included. For the T2tt channel, we assign three additional uncertainties. The first accounts for the difference observed in the performance of the corral algorithm between the standard CMS full and fast detector simulations. This difference decreases with increasing top quark p T and so depends on the difference between m t and m \u03c7 0 1 , reaching 20 % for cases where m \u03c7 0 1 is close to m t . The other two uncertainties each have a magnitude of 5 % and cover the differences observed in parton shower (PS) algorithms (pythia versus herwig) and top quark reconstruction efficiencies in data versus simulation. Table 7 lists the magnitude of each systematic uncertainty in signal points for which this search has sensitivity. For T2tt, the total systematic uncertainty is less than 15 % for m t \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 > 300 GeV. In the absence of any significant observed excesses of events over predicted backgrounds in the various search regions, the modified frequentist CL S method [118][119][120] with a one-sided profile likelihood ratio test statistic is used to define 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limits on the production cross section for both the T2tt and T2bW simplified models as a function of the masses of the SUSY particles involved. Statistical uncertainties related to the observed numbers of events are modelled as Poisson distributions. Systematic uncertainties in the background predictions and signal selection efficiencies are assumed to be multiplicative and are modelled with log-normal distributions.   For each choice of SUSY particle masses, the search region with the highest expected sensitivity (Fig. 7) is chosen to calculate an upper limit for the production cross section. The expected and observed upper limits in the production cross section for both the T2tt and T2bW topologies in the m t \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 plane are displayed in Fig. 16. For the T2tt topology this search is sensitive to models with m t < 775 GeV, or 755 GeV when conservatively subtracting one standard deviation of the theoretical uncertainty, and provides the most stringent limit to date for proton-proton collisions at This search is considerably less sensitive to the T2bW topology because that model does not feature on-shell top quark decays. The sensitivity in this case applies to scenarios with m t < 650 GeV, with the strongest results for large x models for which m \u03c7 \u00b1 is closer to m t than m \u03c7 0  + m W \u2248 m \u03c7 \u00b1 because in this scenario the signal has a low efficiency to pass the baseline selection's jet-multiplicity criterion.",

A dedicated top quark pair reconstruction algorithm provides efficient identification of hadronically decaying top quarks. The search is carried out in several search regions based on the output of multivariate discriminators, where the standard model background yield is estimated with corrected simulation samples and validated in data control regions. The observed yields are statistically compatible with the standard model estimates and are used to restrict the allowed parameter space for these two signal topologies.
