In addition to its main goal, the experiment is well suited to determine the neutrino velocity with high accuracy through the measurement of the time of flight and of the distance between the source of the CNGS neutrino beam at CERN (CERN Neutrino beam to Gran Sasso) [8,9] and the OPERA detector at LNGS. For CNGS neutrino energies, < E \u03bd > = 17 GeV, the relative deviation from the speed of light c of the neutrino velocity due to its finite rest mass is expected to be smaller than 10 \u221219 , even assuming the mass of the heaviest neutrino eigenstate to be as large as 2 eV [10,11]. Hence, any larger deviation of the neutrino velocity, v, from c would point to Lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector.",

With a baseline analogous to that of OPERA but at lower neutrino energies (E \u03bd peaking at 3 GeV with a tail JHEP10(2012)093 extending above 100 GeV), the MINOS experiment reported a measurement of (v \u2212 c)/c = (5.1 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [14]. At much lower energy, in the 10 MeV range, a stringent limit of |v \u2212 c|/c < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 was set by the observation of (anti) neutrinos emitted by the SN1987A supernova [15][16][17].",

However, by measuring the time distributions of protons for each extraction for which neutrino interactions are observed in the detector, and summing them together, after proper normalisation one obtains the probability density function (PDF) of the time of emission of the neutrinos within the duration of extraction. Each proton waveform is UTC time-stamped as well as the events detected by OPERA. The two time-stamps are related by TOF c , the expected time of flight assuming the speed of light [23]. It is worth stressing that this measurement does not rely on the difference between a start and a stop signal but on the comparison of two event time distributions.",

Assuming that 400 GeV protons travel at the speed of light over this distance induces a negligible correction of 0.007 ns. The point where the parent meson produces a neutrino in the decay tunnel is unknown. However, this introduces a negligible inaccuracy in the neutrino time of flight measurement, because JHEP10(2012)093 the produced mesons are ultra-relativistic. This affects TOF \u03bd by a correction of the order of d/2c\u03b3 2 , with d being the meson decay length, on average 450 m from the target, and \u03b3 its Lorentz factor, on average as large as 190. By a full FLUKA-based simulation of the CNGS beam [24][25][26] it was shown that the time difference computed assuming a particle moving at the speed of light from the target down to LNGS, with respect to the value derived by taking into account the speed of the relativistic parent meson down to its decay point is less than 0.02 ns. Similar arguments apply to muons produced in muon neutrino CC interactions occurring in the rock in front of the OPERA detector and seen in the apparatus (external events). With a full GEANT simulation of external events it was shown that ignoring the position of the interaction point in the rock introduces a bias smaller than 2 ns with respect to those events occurring in the target (internal events), provided that external interactions are selected by requiring identified muons in OPERA. More details on the muon identification procedure are given in [27].",

The proton transit time was tagged upstream of the BCT by two fast beam pick-ups BPK400099 and BPK400207 with a time response of 1 ns [52]. From the relative positions of the three detectors (the pick-ups and the BCT) along the beam line and the signals from the two pick-ups one determines the time the protons cross the BCT and the time delay at the level of the WFD. In order to achieve an accurate determination of the delay between the BCT and the BPK signals, a measurement was performed in the particularly clean experimental condition of the SPS proton injection to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) machine of 12 bunches with a width of about 1 ns and with 50 ns spacing, passing through the BCT and the two pick-up detectors. This measurement was performed simultaneously for the 12 bunches and yielded \u2206t BCT = (580 \u00b1 5 (sys.)) ns. The systematic error also accounts for uncertainties on the modelling of the time response of the BCT, including cables and JHEP10(2012)093 electronics, which results in a broadening of the digitised signal with respect to the proton current pulse.

Both measurements provided the same result of (4263\u00b11) ns. The frontend card time-stamp is performed in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) by incrementing a coarse counter every 0.6 s and a fine counter with a frequency of 100 mHz. At the occurrence of a trigger the content of the two counters provides a measure of the arrival time. The fine counter is reset every 0.6 s by the arrival of the Master Clock signal that also increments the coarse counter. The internal delay of the FPGA processing the Master Clock signal to reset the fine counter was determined by a parallel measurement of trigger and clock signals with the DAQ and a digital oscilloscope. This measured delay (FPGA latency) is (24.5\u00b11.0) ns. This takes into account the 10 ns quantization effect due to the clock period.",

This is shown in figure 9 where the distribution of the time difference between the earliest TT hit and the average time of the event, and the average time of the muon track are shown for internal and external events, respectively.

A delay of 4262 ns was obtained confirming the previous measurement.  Figure 10. A simplified scheme of the OPERA Master Clock opto-electronic circuit used to convert the ESAT PPmS optical signal into an electric signal. An additional test used the same extra path and 1PPmS signal to inject a signal equivalent to 100 p.e. at the PMT connector level by means of a 2.3 pF capacitor. The analysis of the time-stamps of such generated events, recorded by the DAQ as it is done for neutrino data taking, showed that the time delay between two consecutive events (separated by 1 ms) was 0.124 ns larger than expected. As a consequence the event time stamp was overestimated by a quantity which depends on the event position inside the DAQ cycle, up to a maximum of 74 ns. This effect was due to a frequency offset between the OPERA Master Clock and ESAT GPS2 oscillators, as proven by comparing them to a Cs Frequency Standard (10 MHz). The 10 MHz Vectron OC-050 Oscillator of the OPERA Master Clock frequency was slightly larger (0.124 ppm) than the specifications.",

The analysis had revealed no such events but confirmed the existence of a significant flux of almost horizontal cosmic muons from the so called \"Teramo Valley\", a region in the massif orography with large zenith angles (\u03b8 > 80 deg) and modest rock thickness (\u223c 2200 m) [63]. The idea was to use these data to determine when the above mentioned discrepancy in the fibre delay at LNGS occurred or started to develop. Since single horizontal muons traverse first the OPERA detector and then, at a distance of \u223c160 m, the LVD apparatus, any change in the timing chain of one of the two experiments would be reflected in a change of the cosmic muon time of flight over the OPERA-LVD distance.

The figure indicates two abrupt changes in \u2206t \u00b5 , one around August 2008 and the other in December 2011. In between \u2206t \u00b5 stays constant thus corresponding to a stable configuration of the detectors' timing systems. The extracted value of (73.2 \u00b1 9) nsec [61,62] is compatible with the fibre recalibration described in section 6.1. The observed \u2206t \u00b5 decrease in December 2011 is related to proper reconnection of the optical fibre to the OPERA Master Clock during a technical intervention. The increase of \u2206t \u00b5 in August 2008 originated from an anomalous set-up of the OPERA timing system which remained in a stable configuration over the whole data taking period considered in the neutrino velocity analysis. The data dispersion of figure 12 compared to a horizontal line in the flat region between 2008 and 2011 corresponds to 3.7 ns. This dispersion has been considered as the systematic error on the 8.3 km fibre delay.",

A value 73.2 ns larger than the one determined in 2006 and 2007 and a larger jitter of the Opera Master Clock latching of the GPS signal were measured. Further investigations, that lasted until mid February 2012, revealed that the difference originated from an optical cable not properly connected thus reducing the amount of light received by the optical/electrical converter of the Master Clock. When proper connections were restored, during a technical intervention, the values of the delay and of the jitter were found to agree with what was measured in 2006 and 2007, as listed below: 2006 t A = (40995.5 \u00b1 0.3) ns RMS = 3.2 ns 2011: before fibre reconnection t A = (41068.6 \u00b1 0.5) ns RMS = 6.0 ns 2011: after fibre reconnection t A = (40994.1 \u00b1 0.3) ns RMS = 3.2 ns",
