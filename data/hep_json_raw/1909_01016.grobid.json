However, two anomalies, the first one related to the absolute flux and the second one to the spectral shape, have yet to be solved. The flux anomaly is known as the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly and could be caused by the existence of a light sterile neutrino eigenstate participating in the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. Introducing a sterile state implies the presence of a fourth mass eigenstate, while global fits favour oscillation parameters around sin 2 (2\u03b8) = 0.09 and \u2206m 2 = 1.8eV 2 .",

It is one of the first running experiments built to search for eV sterile neutrinos and takes data since end of 2016 at ILL Grenoble, France. At a short baseline of 10 metres, it measures the antineutrino flux and spectrum emitted by a compact research reactor. The segmentation of the detector in six target cells allows for independent measurements of the neutrino spectrum at multiple baselines. An active-sterile flavour oscillation could be unambiguously detected, as it distorts the spectral shape of each cell's measurement differently.",

It is a reactor antineutrino experiment searching for a light sterile neutrino eigenstate in the eV mass range. It is thereby searching for a possible explanation of a measured deficit in reactor neutrino flux observed at baselines under 100 metres which is known as Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA) [1]. Currently, global fits of various experiments hint for a sterile neutrino with oscillation parameters around sin 2 (2\u03b8) = 0.09 and \u2206m 2 = 1.8eV 2 as explanation to the RAA [2]. Stereo probes this parameter space at a baseline of 9 to 11 metres.",

The reactor is highly enriched in 235 U and runs at a thermal power of 58.3 MW th . The detection reaction of electron antineutrinos inside the liquid scintillator (LS) of the detector is given by an inverse beta-decay (IBD), which produces a coincidence signal of a positron event followed by a neutron capture arXiv:1909.01016v1 [hep-ex] 3 Sep 2019 event. 48 Hamamatsu 8 inch PMTs observe light produced when the positron annihilation and the radiative neutron capture takes place in the 2000 litre target scintillator as well as the scintillator filled outer-crown volume. The kinetic energy of the positron is directly connected to the antineutrino energy, thus allowing for a measurement of the neutrino energy spectrum. The LS in all volumes are admixtures of LAB, PXE and DIN. In addition, the target LS is doped with a Gd-\u03b2-diketonate complex to achieve a high neutron detection efficiency. DIN is added to enhance the particle identification by pulse-shape discrimination. The spatial resolution of the detector is augmented by optically separating the target volume along the neutrino path of flight in six equally sized cells of 36 cm thickness. This allows a relative measurement of the neutrino spectrum at six baselines. The expected sensitivity regions after one year of reactor-on data can be found in Fig. 2.",

In addition, a 15 m.w.e. topshielding protects against atmospheric radiation. Remaining atmospheric radiation, neutrons and gammas can mimic the neutrino signature in form of accidental or correlated signal coincidences. Their magnitude can effectively be estimated by reactor-off phases. During these periods, a measurement of false neutrino candidates originating only from backgrounds is possible. Moreover, active countermeasures against background are employed such as the use of a water Cherenkov muon veto above the neutrino detector, a specific set of cuts on the PMT hit pattern of each event and selections on the topology of the coincidence signal or the pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) parameter.",

The light yield is determined as 270 PE per MeV and a good homogeneity of the energy response is found across the fiducial volume using a 54 Mn gamma source. A small 3% difference is found when comparing the energy response at the border with that of the centre. The findings are reproduced with simulations at the percent level. Furthermore, the response is found stable over time and a good resolution is found by investigating captures of spallation neutrons by hydrogen throughout the entire target volume (Fig. 3). The neutrino candidate event rates over time can be found in Fig. 4. All rates are corrected for dead times and their dependence on atmospheric pressure. The change in rate for reactor-on and reactor-off periods is clearly seen. The black data points are obtained by requiring for the total energy of the prompt event 1.5 MeV < E < 8 MeV and less than 1.1 MeV deposited in the outer-crown. The delayed event is required to have an energy between 5 and 10 MeV in the entire detector and more than 1 MeV has to be detected in the target. Moreover, the delay between the prompt and delayed events may not exceed 70 s. For the prompt event signal, the PSD parameter is required to deviate less than 2.5 \u03c3 from the central PSD value for that event energy.",

These are defined by taking into account the event topology of the PMT hit pattern in order to reduce the amount of background coincidences caused by stopping muons. Moreover, accidental coincidences are suppressed by a large fraction when requiring a distance between the prompt and the delayed events of less than 0.4 m. A further reduction of non-IBD events can be achieved by requiring a highly localised energy deposition. This is done by demanding less than 0.7 MeV of energy in the cells next to the main cell of the interaction. Applying the entire set of cuts yields a factor of two improvement on the signal-to-background ratio while introducing a signal inefficiency in the few percent order.",
