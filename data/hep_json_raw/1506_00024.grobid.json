            "text": "Since the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) started its first successful high-energy operations in 2010, hopes that new physics beyond the standard model (SM) would appear any moment were running high. With the large accumulated amount of proton-proton data at center-of-mass energies \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, more and more sophisticated searches for new physics came along. Among the theoretical paradigms tested to a great extent are the recent models with extra spatial dimensions, either flat or curved, that appeared about a decade ago and quickly gained a lot of attention from both theoretical and experimental communities. These models offer a different solution to the infamous \"hierarchy problem\" that plagues the SM, and promise an exciting possibility of studying quantum gravity at the LHC, including the most mysterious of its manifestations: the black holes. In this review, the current status of searches for extra spatial dimensions and quantum gravity with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC is presented. While so far all these searches came empty-handed, several new experimental methods and techniques have been developed, which also apply to other searches for new physics. Among these techniques are an empirical method to predict QCD background in high-multiplicity events from low-multiplicity samples, as well as dedicated methods of reconstructing objects with high Lorentz boost, which may be the key signature for discovery of high-mass resonances predicted in a variety of beyond the SM (BSM) models, including the extra dimensional paradigm.",

In this model, only gravity propagates in n flat dimensions assumed to be compactified with a radius R either on a sphere or on a torus. All the SM particles are confined on a 3D membrane (\"brane\") in the (4+n)-dimensional space-time. Apparent weakness of gravity (i.e., the large value of the Planck mass, M P ) can then be explained due to the volume suppression of the fundamentally strong gravity in 3+n dimensions (fundamental Planck scale being M D \u223c 1 TeV), once one looks at its effects in 3 dimensions. Typical values of n being considered are between 2 and 6, with the n = 2 already being significantly constrained by direct gravitaty measurements at short distances and from astrophysical and cosmological observations. [7][8][9] The radius of extra dimensions depends on their number, and the relationship between M D and M P can be established via Gauss's law: 4 M 2 P = 8\u03c0M n+2 D R n (for extra dimensions compactified on a torus). Setting M D = 1 TeV gives R \u223c 1 mm (n = 2) to 1 fm (n = 6).

However, in the absence of published details about the angular distribution of dileptons observed by the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations, we confine our analysis to the invariant mass distributions only. Hence we do not make a separate analysis for the two signs of \u03bb. Evaluating these leads to the result \u2022 Virtual graviton effects. In the ADD model, the KK modes of the graviton are very finely spaced in energy, as the size of extra dimensions is large by particle physics standards. Hence, it is experimentally impossible to distinguish between the individual KK states of the graviton, and their spectrum appears to be continuous. Each KK mode couples to the SM particles with the gravitational coupling, \u221a 4\u03c0G N , where G N is the Newton's constant; since there are many KK modes that can be excited when the momentum transfer is large, the effective gravitational coupling becomes strong and the processes normally transmitted by other gauge bosons, e.g., Drell-Yan fermion pair production, can now be also carried via virtual gravitons (see Fig. 1). Generally, the graviton-mediated diagrams interfere with their SM counterparts, resulting in a modification of the invariant mass spectrum of the final-state objects, particularly at large masses, for which the amplification of the gravitational interaction due to the a large number of the accessible KK excitations becomes significant. This modification can be described via an effective field theory (EFT) approximation, similar to the compositeness operators, [17][18][19] where the \"compositeness scale\" (i.e., the EFT cutoff) M S , is expected to be of order M D . The dependence on the number of extra dimensions is predicted to be weak. 18 \u2022 Direct graviton emission. Since gravity couples to energy-momentum tensor, any SM Feynman diagram vertex can be modified by attaching an extra graviton line to it. Thus, one can take any s-channel production vertex, e.g., qqg or ggg, and add a graviton to it, resulting in a qq \u2192 gG or gg \u2192 gG process, where a gluon jet is recoiling against the graviton, which escapes in the extra dimensions. Just as in the virtual graviton case, when the momentum transfer is large, the corresponding effective coupling increases and the cross section for this reaction could become sizable. The signature for such a process in a collider detector is a single jet, countered by a significant missing momentum in the direction transverse to the beam, i.e. a monojet. This is a spectacular signature, quite different from usual SM jet pair production. Similarly, other objects can recoil against the graviton, giving rise to, e.g., monophoton signature. The probability of such a process is 20), and thus strongly depends both on the fundamental Planck scale and on the number of extra dimensions.",

One of the most spectacular signatures predicted [21][22][23] within the ADD model is a possibility to produce microscopic black holes (BH) when the collision energy exceeds the value of the fundamental Planck scale M D . These BHs may act either as their semi-classical counterparts in general relativity and evaporate via thermal Hawking radiation of various particle species; or they may have more complicated properties of their quantum precursors. Lacking the full picture of quantum gravity, it is impossible to have exact predictions on how these black holes evaporate, so many different possibilities should be considered.",

In either case, the signature is quite spectacular and can be also used to probe more general models with low-scale quantum gravity. The terminal stage of BH evaporation is not known.

The analysis since then has evolved considerably and its later reincarnations 37, 38 probed many more additional BH models, including quantum black holes and string balls. Here we summarize the most recent analysis 38 based on a \u221a s = 8 TeV data sample with an integrated luminosity of 12.1 fb \u22121 . This analysis was performed in inclusive final states, thus maximizing the sensitivity to BH production and decay. Semi-classical black holes are expected to evaporate in a large (\u223c 10) number of energetic particles, emitted nearly isotropically, with the major fraction of the emitted particles being quarks and gluons, 22 resulting in a multijet final state. Quantum effects and gray-body factors may change the relative fraction of emitted quarks and gluons, but generally it is expected that these particles still appear most often even in the decays of quantum black holes or their precursors, due to a large number of color degrees of freedom that quarks and gluons possess, compared to other SM particles.",

This provides a powerful method of predicting the dominant background for BH production by taking the S T shape from dijet events, for which the signal contamination is expected to be negligible, and normalizing it to the observed spectrum at high multiplicities at the low end of the S T distribution, where signal contamination is negligible even for large multiplicities of the finalstate objects. The results are shown in Fig. 3 (left). The CMS data with high final-state multiplicities is well fit by the background shape obtained from the dijet events, No excess characteristic of a BH production is observed even for highest multiplicities. This lack of an apparent signal can be interpreted in a model-independent way by providing a limit on the cross section for any new physics signal for S T values above a certain cutoff, for any given inclusive final state multiplicity. An example of such a limit is shown in Fig. 3 (right), for the final-state multiplicity N \u2265 10. For signals corresponding to large values of S T (above 2 TeV or so) the cross section limit reaches \u223c 0.3 fb. These limits can be compared with the production cross section for black holes in a variety of models and used to set limits on the minimum BH mass (M BH ) that can be produced in these models. They are also applicable to other final states, e.g., from cascade decays of massive supersymmetric particles, thus making this search even more general. In fact, this very limit has been recently reinterpreted in terms of constraints on For several specific models of semi-classical black holes the limits have been set explicitly via optimization of the analysis for these particular scenarios. These limits, although not very reliable for the black hole masses approaching the fundamental Planck scale, are shown in Fig. 4.",

In this case, the result is based on the S T spectrum at low final-state object multiplicity (N = 2). Given that in this case one expects a contamination of the S T spectrum from signal, we predict QCD background at large S T by simply extrapolating the fit function from the low-S T range, which is used to determine the parameters of a smooth background fit and has negligible signal contamination (see Fig. 5). We also check the background prediction obtained in this way by comparing it with the prediction based on the template obtained from the N = 3 spectrum (dashed blue line), which falls well within the uncertainties of the extrapolated background estimate. Another search for quantum black holes in CMS was done using the dijet invariant mass spectrum 40 obtained in the \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset with an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . In this case, the spectrum is fit with a sum of a smooth background template and a signal mass template obtained in simulation (see Fig. 6 (left)). The analysis is a part of a general program of dijet resonance searches and set similar limits on quantum BH (see Fig. 6 (right)) as the S T -based analysis 38 (see Fig. 5 (right)). While the properties of quantum black holes remain an enigma, one could address a question of a light black hole formation in simple string theory models, which may correctly describe the effects of quantum gravity. One of the suggestions is that a precursor of a black hole is a highly excited excited string state, randomly folded in a \"string ball\". 41 The properties of such a string ball are expected to be similar to those of a semi-classical black hole, with the exception that its evaporation takes place at a fixed, Hagedorn temperature, 42 which does not depend on the string ball mass, but only on the string scale M s and string coupling constant g s . Thus, the semi-classical black hole analysis 38 can be also used to set limits on string balls, which are shown in Fig. 7   Fig. 2, normalized to the statistical uncertainty of the data. The 0b, 1b, and 2b m jj dijet mass spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The function of Eq. (1) is also fit to these data  ",

Note that CMS has conducted an earlier analysis at \u221a s = 7 TeV in the ZZ \u2192 eejj +\u00b5\u00b5jj final state 54 focused on the mass range below 1 TeV. That analysis claimed an exclusion limit of 0.645 TeV on the bulk graviton mass. However, the mass exclusion was based on the original theoretical calculations, 51 which have been recently revised down by a factor of four. 56 The signal cross section curves in Fig. 8 do reflect this updated cross section; hence this figure is not directly comparable with Fig. 3 (right) of Ref. 54 in terms of the signal model. A search for a KK excitation of a gluon in the RS model with gluons in the bulk 57 has been done in the tt decay mode, both in semileponic (resolved and boosted topologies) and all-hadronic decay modes of the tt quark pair.

The analysis set a lower mass limit of 2.5 TeV (2.4 TeV expected) at a 95% CL. Recently, this result has been superseded by a more advanced jet substructure analysis in the all-hadronic channel, and the dilepton channel has  The cross section for the production of a bulk graviton withk = 0.5 is shown as a red solid curve.

In this model, only even KK excitations of gauge bosons, e.g., of the W boson, can couple to SM fermions, due to KK parity conservation. Thus, one could search for the decay of the second KK excitation of the W boson, W (2) KK , into a lepton (e or \u00b5) and a neutrino.

These resonances are expected to be strongly produced and also mass-degenerate, with the mass close to the string scale M S . 75,76 Therefore, the cross section for string resonance production is very large and stringent limits reaching 5.0 TeV are set on their existence (see Fig. 12). 40  lower limits on the effective Planck scale, M D , as a function of the number in the ADD model, together with LO results from similar searches at the P [59][60][61][62] and CMS [63]  ater than 410 GeV at 95% CL. These limits along with the existing limits he Tevatron [13], are shown in Fig. 6. Branon masses M B < 3.5 TeV are for low brane tension (20 GeV). These bounds are the most stringent pube limits complement astrophysical constraints already set on the branon Finally, there is also a search for jet extinction in the inclusive jet production, which is another way to looks for black holes or their quantum precursors. The idea is that jet production may be suppressed above a certain energy threshold where these new phenomena open up, which could be inferred from a deviation of an inclusive jet p T spectrum from a smooth power-law falling function. 77 The CMS experiment has conducted the first search for this phenomenon to date using a data ",

In many cases, the limits obtained by CMS are the most restrictive to date. While the possibility to see these phenomena at the LHC is diminishing, the current searches are completely limited by the maximum machine energy of 8 TeV reached so far. There is still a lot of uncovered model parameter space left, which will be explored as early as this year by exploiting the LHC potential close to its design energy of 14 TeV. ",
