            "text": "This paper presents a new method (called \"Tau Particle Flow\") of reconstructing the individual charged and neutral hadrons in tau decays with the ATLAS detector. Charged hadrons are reconstructed from their tracks in the tracking system. Neutral pions are reconstructed from their energy deposits in the calorimeter. The reconstructed hadrons, which make up the visible part of the tau decay (\u03c4 had-vis ), are used to classify the decay mode and to calculate the fourmomentum of reconstructed \u03c4 had-vis candidates. The superior four-momentum resolution from the tracking system compared to the calorimeter, for charged hadrons with transverse momentum ( p T ) less than \u223c100 GeV, leads to a significant improvement in the tau energy and directional resolution. This improvement, coupled with the ability to better identify the hadronic tau decay modes, could lead to better resolution of the ditau mass reconstruction [24]. The performance of the Tau Particle Flow is validated using samples of real hadronic tau decays and jets in Z +jets events selected from data. The samples correspond to 5 fb \u22121 of data collected during proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, which was the amount of data reprocessed using Tau Particle Flow. While similar concepts for the reconstruction of hadronic tau decays have been employed at other experiments [25][26][27][28][29][30][31], the Tau Particle Flow is specifically designed to exploit the features of the ATLAS detector and to perform well in the environment of the LHC.",

The inner detector is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field, and consists of pixel and silicon microstrip detectors inside a transition radiation tracker, which together provide charged-particle tracking in the region |\u03b7| < 2.5. 1 The EM calorimeter is based on lead and liquid argon as absorber and active material, respectively. In the central rapidity region, the EM calorimeter is divided radially into three layers: the innermost layer (EM1) is finely segmented in \u03b7 for optimal \u03b3 /\u03c0 0 separation, the layer next in radius (EM2) collects most of the energy deposited by electron and photon showers, and the third layer (EM3) is used to correct leakage beyond the EM calorimeter for high-energy showers. A thin presampler layer (PS) in front of EM1 and in the range |\u03b7| < 1.8 is used to correct showers for upstream energy loss. Hadron calorimetry is based on different detector technologies, with scintillator tiles (|\u03b7| < 1.7) or liquid argon (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) as active media, and with steel, copper, or tungsten as absorber material. The calorimeters provide coverage within |\u03b7| < 4.9. The muon spectrometer consists of superconducting air-core toroids, a system of trigger chambers covering the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, and high-precision tracking chambers allowing muon momentum measurements within |\u03b7| < 2.7. A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events [32]. The firstlevel trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to a design value of at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels which together reduce the average event rate to 400 Hz.",

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse (x, y) plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam direction. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).

Suppression of backgrounds from other particles misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis is achieved independently of the Tau Particle Flow. The Baseline \u03c4 had-vis reconstruction and energy calibration, and the algorithms used to suppress backgrounds from jets, electrons and muons are described in detail in Ref. [17]. Candidates for hadronic tau decays are built from jets reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [33,34] with a radius parameter value of 0.4. Three-dimensional clusters of calorimeter cells calibrated using a local hadronic calibration [35,36] serve as inputs to the jet algorithm. The calculation of the \u03c4 had-vis four-momentum uses clusters within the core region ( R < 0.2 from the initial jet-axis). It includes a final tau-specific calibration derived from simulated samples, which accounts for out-of-cone energy, underlying event, the typical composition of hadrons in hadronic tau decays and contributions from multiple interactions occurring in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (called pile-up). Tracks reconstructed in the inner detector are matched to the \u03c4 had-vis candidate if they are in the core region and satisfy the following criteria: p T > 1 GeV, at least two associated hits in the pixel layers of the inner detector, and at least seven hits in total in the pixel and silicon microstrip layers. Furthermore, requirements are imposed on the distance of closest approach of the tracks to the tau primary vertex in the transverse plane, |d 0 | < 1.0 mm, and longitudinally, |z 0 sin \u03b8 | < 1.5 mm. The \u03c4 had-vis charge is reconstructed from the sum of the charges of the associated tracks.",

Table 2 gives the following details for each of the five decay modes: the branching fraction, B; the fraction of simulated \u03c4 had-vis candidates that pass the \u03c4 had-vis selection described in Sect. 2.2 without the jet and electron discrimination, A \u2022 \u03b5 reco ; and the fraction of those that also pass the jet and electron discrimination, \u03b5 ID .

The h \u00b1 's are sufficiently long-lived that they typically Table 2 Five dominant \u03c4 had-vis decay modes [59]. Tau neutrinos are omitted from the table.

The \u03c0 0 's decay almost exclusively to a pair of photons. Approximately half of the photons convert into an e + e \u2212 pair because of interactions with the beampipe or inner-detector material. Modes with more \u03c0 0 's tend to have lower \u03b5 ID as they have wider showers that are more similar to those produced by quarkand gluon-initiated jets. The mode dependence of A \u2022 \u03b5 reco is due to a mixture of effects. The fraction of energy carried by visible decay products is mode dependent and the response of the calorimeter to h \u00b1 's and \u03c0 0 's is different, both of which impact the efficiency of the \u03c4 had-vis p T requirement. The efficiency of the track association is also dependent on the number of h \u00b1 's and to a lesser extent the number of \u03c0 0 's, which can contribute tracks from conversion electrons. The goal of the Tau Particle Flow is to classify the five decay modes and to reconstruct the individual h \u00b1 's and \u03c0 0 's. The performance is evaluated using the energy and directional residuals of \u03c0 0 and \u03c4 had-vis and the efficiency of the \u03c4 had-vis decay mode classification. The \u03b7 and \u03c6 residuals are defined with respect to the generated values: \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 gen and \u03c6 \u2212\u03c6 gen , respectively.

In this case the hadrons typically have p T lower than 20 GeV (peaked at \u223c4 GeV) and have an average separation of R \u2248 0.07. The h \u00b1 's are reconstructed using the tracking system, from which the charge and momentum are determined. Each track associated with the \u03c4 had-vis candidate in the core region is considered to be a h \u00b1 and the \u03c0 \u00b1 mass hypothesis is applied. Approximately 2 % of the selected \u03c4 had-vis 's have a misclassified number of h \u00b1 's. Overestimation of the number of h \u00b1 's is primarily due to additional tracks from conversion electrons, which are highly suppressed by the strict track selection criteria described in Sect. 2.2. Underestimation of the number of h \u00b1 's is primarily caused by tracking inefficiencies (\u223c10 % for charged pions with p T > 1 GeV [1]), which arise from interactions of the h \u00b1 's with the beampipe or detector material. The h \u00b1 's also produce a shower in the calorimeter from which their energy and direction can be determined, but the tracker has a better performance in the relevant momentum range. The shower shapes of h \u00b1 's are also highly irregular, with a typical width of 0.02 < R < 0.07 in the EM calorimeter, combined with large fluctuations in the fractional energy depositions in the layers of the calorimeter. The \u03c0 0 's are reconstructed from their energy deposits in the EM calorimeter. The main challenge is to disentangle their energy deposits from h \u00b1 showers, which have a width similar to the average separation between hadrons. The photons from \u03c0 0 decays are highly collimated, with a typical separation of 0.01 < R < 0.03. The majority of the \u03c0 0 energy is reconstructed in a single cluster in the EM calorimeter. Compared to h \u00b1 's, \u03c0 0 showers are smaller and more regular, leaving on average 10, 30 and 60 % of their energy in PS, EM1 and EM2, respectively. Almost no \u03c0 0 energy is deposited beyond EM2, so EM3 is considered part of the HAD calorimeter in Tau Particle Flow. The characteristic shower shapes and the kinematics of h \u00b1 's and \u03c0 0 's are used to identify \u03c0 0 's and to classify the tau decay mode.",

The purity of \u03c0 0 cand 's is improved by applying a minimum p T requirement and an identification criterion designed to reject \u03c0 0 cand 's not from \u03c0 0 's. The p T thresholds are in the range 2.1-2.7 GeV. After the p T requirement the background is dominated by h \u00b1 remnants. The \u03c0 0 identification uses a BDT and exploits the properties of the \u03c0 0 cand clusters, such as the energy density and the width and depth of the shower. The variables used for \u03c0 0 cand identification are described in Table 3. The BDT is trained using \u03c4 had-vis 's that have only one h \u00b1 , and which are produced in simulated Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. The \u03c0 0 cand 's are assigned to signal or background based on whether or not they originated from a generated \u03c0 0 . Figure 1a shows signal and background distributions for the logarithm of the second moment in energy density, which is one of the more important identification variables. The discriminating power of the \u03c0 0 identification is quantified by comparing the efficiency of signal and background \u03c0 0 cand 's to pass thresholds on the identification score, as shown in Fig. 1b. The p T and identification score thresholds are optimised in five |\u03b7| ranges, corresponding to structurally different regions of the calorimeter, to maximise the number of \u03c4 had-vis 's with the correct number of reconstructed h \u00b1 's and identified \u03c0 0 cand 's (\u03c0 0 ID 's). The h \u00b1 and \u03c0 0 counting performance is depicted in Fig. 2 by a decay mode classification matrix which shows the probability for a given generated mode to be reconstructed as a particular mode. Only \u03c4 had-vis decays that are reconstructed and pass the selection described in Sect. 2.2 are considered (corresponding efficiencies are given in Table 2). The total fraction of correctly classified tau decays (diagonal fraction) is 70.9 %. As can be seen, for \u03c4 had-vis 's with one h \u00b1 , the separation of modes with and without \u03c0 0 's is quite good, but  it is difficult to distinguish between h \u00b1 \u03c0 0 and h \u00b1 \u22652\u03c0 0 . The largest contributions to the misclassification arise from h \u00b1 \u22652\u03c0 0 decays where one of the \u03c0 0 's failed selection or where the energy deposits of both \u03c0 0 's merge into a single cluster. It is also difficult to distinguish between the 3h \u00b1 and 3h \u00b1 \u22651\u03c0 0 modes because the \u03c0 0 's are typically soft with large overlapping h \u00b1 deposits.",

Decays containing neutral kaons are omitted. Only decays from \u03c4 had-vis 's that are reconstructed and pass the selection described in Sect. 2.2 are considered. The statistical uncertainty is negligible ulation. The shower shapes are normalised such that their integral corresponds to E EM h \u00b1 and centred on the extrapolated position of the h \u00b1 track. They are then subtracted from the EM calorimeter prior to the clustering, replacing the clusterlevel subtraction of E EM h \u00b1 . The \u03c0 0 E T , \u03b7 and \u03c6 residual distributions for all \u03c0 0 reconstruction algorithms are shown in Fig. 3a-c, respectively. The core angular resolutions for each algorithm are quite similar with \u223c0.0056 in \u03b7 and \u223c0.012 rad in \u03c6. The Pi0Finder algorithm has the poorest performance, with core resolutions of 0.0086 and 0.016 rad in \u03b7 and \u03c6, respectively, and significantly larger tails. The core E T resolutions are almost identical for the Tau Particle Flow and SSS, both with 16 %, compared to 23 % for Pi0Finder. The Tau Particle Flow and SSS both show a shift in the reconstructed E T of a few percent, due to incomplete subtraction of the h \u00b1 remnant. In the calculation of the \u03c4 had-vis four-momentum in the Tau Particle Flow (Sect. 3.5), this bias is corrected for by a decaymode-dependent calibration. Despite the more sophisticated shower subtraction employed in the SSS algorithm, it does not perform significantly better; the improvement in the total fraction of correctly classified tau decays is \u223c1 %. This is partly because many of the \u03c0 0 cand 's are sufficiently displaced from h \u00b1 's so that they have little energy contamination and are unaffected by the subtraction, and partly because the signature of clusters that contain \u03c0 0 's, even in the presence of overlapping h \u00b1 energy, is distinct enough for the BDT to identify. Contributions from pile-up have little effect on the cand reconstruction in Tau Particle Flow; on average the E T increases by \u223c15 MeV and its resolution degrades fractionally by \u223c0.5 % per additional reconstructed vertex.",

The identification of the energy deposits from individual photons in the finely segmented EM1 layer can be exploited to improve the \u03c0 0 reconstruction, as discussed in the following. Almost all photons begin to shower by the time they traverse EM1, where they deposit on average \u223c30 % of their energy. In contrast, particles that do not interact electromagnetically rarely deposit a significant amount of energy in this layer, making it ideal for the identification of photons. Furthermore, the cell segmentation in \u03b7 in this layer is finer than the average photon separation and comparable to the average photon shower width, allowing individual photons to be distinguished.",

Figure 4 shows the efficiency for photons to create a local maximum (maxima efficiency), evaluated in the sample of single \u03c0 0 's. The efficiency decreases rapidly at low photon p T as many of the photons fall below the 100 MeV threshold. The fraction of misreconstructed maxima due to noise or fluctuations from the photon shower is very low for maxima with E T > 500 MeV, but increases quickly at lower E T . At high photon p T , corresponding to high \u03c0 0 p T , the boost of the \u03c0 0 becomes large enough that the pair of photons almost always creates a single maximum.

The associated clusters typically have low energy and a low \u03c0 0 identification score. Remnant clusters from imperfect h \u00b1 subtraction are also typically close to the h \u00b1 track and have fewer associated photon energy maxima. If the \u03c0 0 cand clusters originate from tau decays, their directions and fractional energies are correlated with each other. Additionally, with increasing number of tau decay products, the available phase space per decay product becomes smaller. Each variable used in the BDTs is described briefly in Table 4. Table 5 summarises the decay mode tests and indicates which variables are used in each. Figure 5 shows the discrimination power of the tests categorised by the number of \u03c0 0 cand 's and \u03c0 0 ID 's. The decay mode fractions at the input of each test vary strongly, which impacts the position of the optimal BDT requirements. The resulting classification matrix is shown in Fig. 6. The total fraction of correctly classified tau decays is 74.7 %. High efficiencies in the important h \u00b1 , h \u00b1 \u03c0 0 and 3h \u00b1 modes are achieved.

For the final energy calibration of the Tau Particle Flow, the Constituent-based E T is combined with the Baseline E T by weighting each by the inverse-square of their respective E Tdependent core resolutions, which ensures a smooth transition to high p T where the Baseline calibration is superior.

The background in the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 analysis is dominated by multijet and W (\u2192 \u03bc\u03bd)+jets production. The simulated Z (\u2192 \u03bc\u03bc)+jets events are reweighted so that the Z boson p T distribution and the overall normalisation match that in the data. The hatched band represents the statistical uncertainty on the prediction more than five times their combined core resolutions, as it has smaller resolution tails. The resolution of the Tau Particle Flow is superior in both the core and tails at low E T with a core resolution of 8 % at an E T of 20 GeV, compared to 15 % from the Baseline. It approaches the Baseline performance at high E T . Contributions from pile-up have little effect on the four-momentum reconstruction of the Tau Particle Flow; the E T increases by \u223c4 MeV and its core resolution degrades fractionally by \u223c0.5 % per additional reconstructed vertex. The E T residual distributions of the Tau Particle Flow split into the reconstructed decay modes are shown in Fig. 9c. The total is non-Gaussian, as it is the sum of contributions with different functional forms. Correctly reconstructed decays containing only h \u00b1 's have the best resolution, followed by correctly reconstructed decays containing \u03c0 0 cand 's. The excellent resolution of these decays leads to a superior overall core resolution. Misreconstructed decays have the poorest resolution and result in larger tails. In particular, misestimation of the number of \u03c0 0 cand 's leads to a bias of up to 25 %. Decays containing neutral kaons exhibit a large low-energy bias because at least some of their energy is typically missed by the reconstruction.",

It also uses a combination of calorimetric and tracking measurements and the Tau Particle Flow decay mode classification. The h \u00b1 p T is measured using tracks and the \u03c0 0 E T is estimated as the difference between the E T of the seed jet at the EM scale [36] and the E T from the summed momenta of all h \u00b1 's, scaled by their expected calorimeter response [60]. The method has similar overall performance to the Tau Particle Flow. Figure 10a shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the muon and \u03c4 had-vis , m(\u03bc, \u03c4 had-vis ), calculated using the \u03c4 had-vis four-momentum reconstruction from the Tau Particle Flow in the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 tag-and-probe analysis before selection on m(\u03bc, \u03c4 had-vis ). The m(\u03bc, \u03c4 had-vis ) has a linear dependence on the \u03c4 had-vis E T and analysis of the distribution has previously been used to calibrate the \u03c4 had-vis E T [17]. Data and simulation agree well, indicating that the \u03c4 had-vis E T is well modelled by the simulation. Finally, Fig. 10b shows the mass spectrum of the \u03c4 had-vis reconstructed with the Tau Particle Flow in the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 tag-and-probe analysis. The a 1 resonance in the 3h \u00b1 mode is reconstructed with negligible experimental resolution compared to the intrinsic line shape due to the excellent four-momentum resolution of the inner detector for h \u00b1 's. The \u03c1 and a 1 resonances in the h \u00b1 \u03c0 0 and h \u00b1 \u22652\u03c0 0 modes are also visible, but have significant degradation due to the resolution from the reconstructed \u03c0 0 cand four-momentum.

The neutral pions are reconstructed with a core energy resolution of \u223c16 %. The reconstructed hadrons are used to calculate the visible fourmomentum of reconstructed tau candidates and to classify the decay mode, allowing the decays to be distinguished not only by the number of h \u00b1 's but also by the number of \u03c0 0 's, which is not possible with the existing tau reconstruction.
