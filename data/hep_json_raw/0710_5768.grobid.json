            "text": "Similar to the case of inclusive and semi-inclusive DIS, where the nucleon structure is described using Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), hard exclusive reactions can be expressed in terms of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). [1][2][3] The PDFs and elastic nucleon Form Factors (FFs) are included in the GPDs as the limiting cases and moments of GPDs, respectively. 2 While FFs derived in elastic scattering describe the transverse location of partons inside the nucleon and PDFs describe their longitudinal momentum distribution, GPDs are able to provide information on both at the same time. Thus exclusive reactions are able to give a certain 3-dimensional picture of the nucleon structure. [4][5][6] In particular, GPDs offer for the first time a possibility to determine the total angular momentum carried by the quarks in the nucleon. 2 Below recent HERMES measurements on the hard exclusive electropro-duction of real photons (Deeply-Virtual Compton Scattering, DVCS) are summarized and compared to model calculations. The data has been taken with polarized and unpolarized gas targets using the HERMES spectrometer 7 at the HERA electron/positron-proton collider at DESY, which offers longitudinally polarized 27.6 GeV electron and positron beams.",

The real (imaginary) part of the DVCS amplitude M 1,1 can be accessed by measuring the cos \u03c6 (sin \u03c6) dependence of a cross section asymmetry with respect to the charge (spin) of the lepton beam. At HERMES kinematics, the DVCS amplitude M 1,1 gives access to the GPD H. Details and full equations are given in Ref. 9. The event selection at HERMES requires events with exactly one photon and one charged track, identified as the scattered lepton, with Q 2 >1 GeV 2 . For data taken prior to 2006 the recoiling proton is not detected and exclusive events are identified by the fact that the missing mass M x of the reaction ep \u2192 e\u03b3X corresponds to the proton mass. Due to the finite energy resolution the exclusive sample is defined as \u22121.5 < M x < 1.7 GeV. A recoil detector used during the recent data taking should reduce the underlying background from presently about 15% to less than 1%. 10 The beam-spin asymmetry (BSA) and the beam-charge asymmetry (BCA) as a function of \u03c6 are calculated as with the normalized yields \u2212 \u2192 N ( \u2190 \u2212 N ) or N + (N \u2212 ) using a beam with positive (negative) helicity or a positron (electron) beam, respectively. The BSA (BCA) on the proton as a function of \u03c6 has been extracted at HER-MES 11 ( 12 ), whereby the predominant sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6) dependence expected from Eqn. 1 has been observed. The cos \u03c6 amplitudes of the BCA on hydrogen as a function of \u2212t derived from a fit to the BCA in each \u2212t bin 12 are shown in Fig.1, and the recent preliminary BSA result on the kinematic dependences of the sin \u03c6 amplitudes is shown in Fig.2.",

Since these data are exclusively sensitive to the GPD H as mentioned above, the theoretical calculations shown were derived by only varying the model parameters for the GPD H in the underlying code 15 in order to calculate the asymmetries at the average kinematics of every bin. The model parameters differ with respect to including or neglecting the so-called Dterm 16 in the GPD model and whether the t-dependence of the GPD H is calculated in either the simplest ansatz where the t-dependence factorizes from the t-independent part or in the Regge-motivated ansatz. In addition, the so-called skewness parameters b v and b s in the profile function 17 have been set to either unity or infinity, the latter value corresponds to a skewness  -distribution GPD model using a factorized (fac.) or a Regge-inspired (Regge) t-dependence with or without a D-term contribution. The parameters bv and bs are each set to either unity or infinity. Using the resulting 16 sets of model parameters, the calculated asymmetries fall into four main groups, whereby the BSA appears to be insensitive to the D-Term and to the value of bv. The calculations in the right column are based on a dual-parametrization GPD model. 18 independent ansatz for the GPD. The BCA data appears to disfavor the four parameters sets with the Regge-inspired t-dependence and the D-term contribution as well as the factorized one with the D-term which gives the largest asymmetry (b v = 1, b s = \u221e). For the BSA all models seem to overshoot the absolute size of the sin \u03c6 amplitude. The calculations based on the dual parametrization GPD model 18 shown in the right panel (right column) of Fig.1 (Fig.2) are all in rather good agreement with the data.",

It is natural to ask to what extent the GPD E can be accessed, which is the other important GPD necessary in order to determine J q , the total orbital angular momentum of quarks in the nucleon. 2 For an unpolarized proton target the contribution from the GPD E is suppressed with respect to H, but this is different for transverse target polarization. 9,19 Using an unpolarized beam (U) and a transversely (T) polarized target, a sin (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 S ) cos \u03c6 modulation in the DVCS transverse target-spin asymmetry (TTSA) gives access to a combination of the GPDs H and E. 20 Here \u03c6 s denotes the azimuthal angle of the target polarization vector with respect to the lepton scattering plane. The results from HERMES data collected on a transversely polarized hydrogen target are shown in Fig. 3. They agree with the model calculations 20 shown in the same figure, which have been calculated for various values of J u . Based on u-quark dominance the d-quark total angular momentum has been assumed to be zero. Since it was realized that the model calculations are largely insensitive to all model parameters but J u and J d , it is possible to constrain J u and J d even though other model parameters are largely unconstrained. 20 For example, the model calculations in Fig. 3 show little variation if calculated for any of the 16 parameter sets which give very different values for the BCA as shown in Fig.1. Hence the four parameter sets with the Regge-inspired t-dependence and without a contribution of the D-term (solid lines in the left panel of Fig.1), have been chosen in order to determine the parameter space allowed for J u and J d . For different values of J u and J d these sets have been compared to the DVCS TTSA data shown in Fig. 3, leading to a first model dependent constraint on J u versus J d shown in Fig.4. 21 Further improvement can be expected, taking into account that the GPD H and therefore the available theoretical models will be well constrained by the upcoming HERMES data, and that the data shown here is less than half of the data taken on the transversely polarized hydrogen target. Due to the good agreement between the calculations in the dual-parametrization model and the BSA and BCA results as shown above, the next natural step is to also calculate the allowed parameter space for J u and J d within this model. This effort is presently ongoing, but calculations for various values of J u at a fixed J d = 0 18 already indicate that the dual model favors smaller values for J u than the double-distribution one.",

            "text": "Beam-Spin Asymmetries have also been measured on deuterium and various heavier nuclei (He, N, Ne, Kr, Xe). Coherent processes are dominant for small values of \u2212t, while at larger values incoherent scattering on the individual protons and neutrons dominates. Based on MC studies a region of small \u2212t \u2032 (\"coherent enriched\") has been selected for each nucleus in order to have similar average kinematic values for all targets ( \u2212t \u2032 = 0.018  GeV 2 , Q 2 \u2248 1.7 GeV 2 , x B \u2248 0.065). According to the MC studies the fraction of coherent processes is approximately 82% for all but the lighter targets (D, He). Similarly, an \"incoherent enriched\" sample has been selected with an average \u2212t \u2032 of 0.2 GeV 2 . The ratio of the BSA on the nuclei divided by the one on the proton at the same average kinematics is shown in the left panel of Fig.5. A simple fit to a constant for the coherent enriched sample yields a value above unity by two sigma, while the incoherent enriched sample shows asymmetries very similar to the one on the proton. Note that this is in agreement with earlier HERMES preliminary results 22 where a value consistent with unity was found when comparing the BSA on deuterium and neon to the one on the proton in the full t range. The BSAs on nuclei are expected to be similar to the one on the proton in the incoherent enriched sample since scattering on the protons inside the nuclei should dominate due to the fact that the BH process on the neutron is suppressed. The fit value found for the coherent enriched sample is consistent with a very basic prediction of 5/3 for Spin-0 and Spin-1/2 targets, based on the ratio of the involved valence-quark charges squared, 23 as well as with calculations done specifically for neon and krypton. 24 Also a prediction of R= 1-1.1 for Helium 25 is in agreement with the measurement. The result of a recent calculation 26 is shown in the right panel of Fig.5, whereby one of the three models is disfavored by the data.",
