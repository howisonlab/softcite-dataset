Using events with mK\u03c0\u03c0 < 1.8 GeV/c 2 , we measure the branching fractions of B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3, the branching fractions of the kaonic resonances decaying to K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , as well as the overall branching fractions of the B + \u2192 \u03c1 0 K + \u03b3, B + \u2192 K * 0 \u03c0 + \u03b3 and S-wave B + \u2192 (K\u03c0) * 0 0 \u03c0 + \u03b3 components.

            "text": "The V \u2212A structure of the Standard Model (SM) weak interaction implies that the circular polarization of the photon emitted in b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions is predominantly left-handed, with contamination by oppositely-polarized photons suppressed by a factor m s /m b [1,2]. Thus, B 0 mesons decay mostly to right-handed photons while decays of B 0 mesons produce mainly left-handed photons. Therefore, the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in B \u2192 f CP \u03b3 decays, where f CP is a CP eigenstate, is expected to be small. This prediction may be altered by new-physics (NP) processes in which opposite helicity photons are involved. Especially, in some NP models [3][4][5], the right-handed component may be comparable in magnitude to the left-handed component, without affecting the SM prediction for the inclusive radiative decay rate. The present branching fraction measurement of (B(B \u2192 X s \u03b3) exp. = (3.43 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [6]) agrees with the SM prediction of (B(B \u2192 X s \u03b3) th. = (3.36 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7]) calculated at next-to-next-toleading order. Further information on right-handed photon could be obtained by measuring CP asymmetries in different exclusive radiative decay modes. Furthermore, B meson decays to K\u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 can display an interesting hadronic structure, since several resonances decay to three-body K\u03c0\u03c0 final state (referred to as \"kaonic resonances\" throughout the article).

A detector of internally reflected\u010cerenkov light (DIRC) is used for charged particle identification.

Using information from this fit, the K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , K + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariantmass spectra (m K\u03c0\u03c0 , m K\u03c0 , and m \u03c0\u03c0 ) for CR signal events are extracted by means of the s Plot technique [19]. In the second step, we perform a binned maximumlikelihood fit to the CR signal s Plot of m K\u03c0\u03c0 to determine from data the branching fractions of the various kaonic resonances decaying to K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . We finally perform a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the CR signal s Plot of m K\u03c0 to extract from data the amplitudes and the branching fractions of the two-body resonances decaying to K + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The use of a one-dimensional fit in this final step is purely pragmatic; with a larger sample size, a two-dimensional approach would have been possible. The m K\u03c0 projection is used due to the narrower width of the K * (892) resonance compared with that of the \u03c1 0 (770). The m K\u03c0\u03c0 and the m K\u03c0 fit models are described in Sec.

For each K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + resonance, the first source of distortion is studied by comparing the invariant-mass distribution generated by EvtGen [31] to the R k mass used as an input to the generator. We see no significant distortion. For each resonance, the second source of distortion is estimated from the known properties of all decaying processes. Ideally, one should perform an iterative procedure in which the input values of the decaying processes are compared to the results of the fit to the data repeating the procedure until the fit results converge to values compatible with the inputs. However, due to the limited size of the data sample, we use the effective model described in Eqs. (8) and (9) where no correction is applied to the lineshapes. As described in Sec.

The resonance R is decaying either to K + \u03c0 \u2212 when h = \u03c0 + or to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 when h = K + . To correct for efficiency effects, we construct efficiency maps in the m K\u03c0 -m \u03c0\u03c0 plane for each kaonic resonance in the fit model. For each exclusive decay, the efficiency map is determined from the phase space decay of that resonance (B + \u2192 K res (K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03b3). The efficiency map of the combined sample shown in Fig. 1 is obtained by applying weights to the individual maps, which were extracted from the fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum. The m K\u03c0 spectrum is corrected for efficiency effects by dividing the (m K\u03c0 , m \u03c0\u03c0 ) s Plot distribution by the combined efficiency map and integrating over the m \u03c0\u03c0 dimension. The approach of projecting the m \u03c0\u03c0 -m K\u03c0 phase space of B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b3 onto the m K\u03c0 axis was chosen since the sample size was too small for a two-dimensional fit. This is further complicated by the four-body nature of the decay: since the value of m K\u03c0\u03c0 can vary from event to event, the kinematic boundaries for the m \u03c0\u03c0m K\u03c0 plane vary as well. We model the m K\u03c0 spectrum as the projection of two 1 \u2212 P-wave and one 0 + S-wave components. The two P-wave components, namely the K * (892) 0 and the \u03c1(770) 0 resonances, are described by relativistic Breit-Wigner (RBW) and Gounaris-Sakurai (GS) [32] lineshapes, respectively. The 0 + (S-wave) component of the K\u03c0 spectrum, designated by (K\u03c0) * 0 0 , is modeled by the LASS parametrization [33], which consists of the K * 0 (1430) 0 resonance together with an effective range nonresonant (NR) component.",

Those describing the K * (892) 0 \u03c0 and K\u03c1(770) 0 decay are both obtained from the projection onto the m K\u03c0 axis of a two-dimensional histogram, constructed as the combination of the individual kaonic resonance contribution to the corresponding resonance (i.e. K res \u2192 K * (892) 0 \u03c0 or K\u03c1(770) 0 ).

Table VII summarizes the relative magnitudes and phases of the different components of the signal model, measured directly from the fit to the m K\u03c0 spectrum, as well as the corresponding fit fractions computed using Eqs. (10) and (11). The statistical uncertainties on the magnitudes and phases come directly from the fit while the statistical uncertainties on the fit fractions are estimated in the same way as those obtained in the fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum. As in the fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum, we perform likelihood scans of the fitted parameters, shown in Fig. 7, in order to check for multiple solutions. The fitted solution appears to be unique. Table VIII summarizes the branching fractions via intermediate K + \u03c1(770) 0 , K * (892) 0 \u03c0 + and (K\u03c0) * 0 0 \u03c0 + decays that are obtained after inserting the two-body resonance fit fractions into Eq.

Since the (K\u03c0) * 0 0 component is modeled by the LASS parametrization, which consists of a NR effective range term plus a relativistic Breit-Wigner term for the K * 0 (1430) 0 resonance, we report a separate branching fraction for the K * 0 (1430) 0 of To correct for the secondary branching fractions, we used the values from Ref. [18] and B(K * (892) 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 2 3 . The first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic (see Sec.

The last two rows of the table are obtained by separating the contributions from the resonant and the nonresonant part of the LASS parametrization. Integrating separately the resonant part, the nonresonant part, and the coherent sum we find that the nonresonant part accounts for 95.6%, the resonant contribution 7.92%, and the destructive interference \u22123.52%.

The dilution factor uncertainties depend on uncertainties of the two-body amplitudes obtained from a fit to the m K\u03c0 spectrum (see Sec. IV D 2), themselves depending on the uncertainties of the kaonic-resonance amplitudes obtained from a fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum (see Sec. IV D 1). Finally, in Sec. IV D 3, the systematic uncertainties corresponding to the branching fractions measurements are described. For the combination of asymmetric systematic uncertainties, the method described in Ref. [36] was used. Table IX gives the systematic uncertainties on the kaonic resonance amplitude parameters and Table X gives the systematic uncertainties on the corresponding fit fractions. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are the fixed parameters of the resonance lineshapes in the m K\u03c0\u03c0 fit model. The large relative effect of fixed line-shape parameters on the magnitude and the fit fraction of the K * 2 (1430) are due to its small contribution. To assign systematic uncertainties due to the fixed parameters in the fit to m ES , \u2206E and F, we vary each of the fixed parameters within its uncertainty, based on a fit to the simulated event sample, and we repeat the fit. Since the m ES -\u2206E distribution of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (\u2192 K\u03c0)\u03b3 + B 0 \u2192 X sd (\u2192 K\u03c0)\u03b3 background events is described by a twodimensional histogram, the fit is performed fluctuating the bin contents according to a Gaussian distribution centered on the nominal bin content and with a width given by the corresponding statistical uncertainty. The procedure is repeated 50 times. The root mean square (rms) of the resulting distribution of fitted parameter values is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The fixed yields are varied according to the corresponding branching fraction uncertainties taken from Ref. [18]. For the categories describing a sum of modes, the fraction of each mode is varied according to the relative branching fraction uncertainties taken from Ref. [18]. The mis-reconstructed signal yield is varied according to the uncertainties due to the sample size of simulated events and the signal branching fraction uncertainty in Ref. [18]. The fixed yield of the generic B-background category, describing a sum of several small contributions from various B-background modes, is varied within the uncertainties due to the sample size of simulated events. For each new fit performed this way, we derive the corresponding m K\u03c0\u03c0 s Plot distribution that we then fit using the nominal m K\u03c0\u03c0 model. Assuming no correlations among the fixed parameters, we combine each of the negative (positive) difference between the new fit value and nominal fit value of each free parameter, and take the resulting values as negatively  X. Systematic uncertainties on the kaonic resonance fit fractions extracted from a fit to the mK\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum. The symbol \u2205 denotes a systematic uncertainty of zero, while 0.0 indicates that the corresponding systematic uncertainty is less than 0.05%. The term \"Sum\" represents the sum of all fit fractions without interference terms, which can deviate from unity. To assign systematic uncertainties due to the choice of bin size in the fitted dataset, we perform new fits using either 60 or 100 bins, instead of 80 in the nominal fit model.",

We considered three additional resonances, the K 2 (1770), the K * 3 (1780), and the K 2 (1820), whose parameters are given in Table XI. We add each of these resonances in turn to the model and re-perform the fit to the CR signal m K\u03c0\u03c0 s Plot distribution. We observe no variations on the parameters of the fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum when the K 2 (1820) is added to the resonance model. Using the method described in Ref. [36], we combine each of the negative (positive) difference between the new fit value and nominal fit value due to the presence of either the K 2 (1770) or the K * 3 (1780) in the resonance model. If the yields of one or more event categories are fixed in the fit to an s Plot spectrum, a correction is necessary (see Ref. [19]) to extract the CR signal s Plot. This correction implies that the distributions of the variable of interest for the fixed categories are well known. The m K\u03c0\u03c0 distributions of the event categories with fixed yields cannot be considered to completely fulfill this criterion since they are taken from simulation. A detailed description of the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties due to the s Plot technique is given in Appendix B.  0 parameters and fit fraction are due to the low sensitivity to this component.",

            "text": "The s Plot technique corresponds to a background subtracting method. It takes place in the context of a unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit, making use of the discriminating variables denoted y. The aim of s Plot technique is to unfold the true distribution, M n (x), of a variable x, whose distributions are unknown for signal events. An estimate of the x-distribution, denoted sMn , can be defined as the sum of the s Weights in each bin, as described in Ref. [19]. If one or more event categories have their yields fixed in the maximumlikelihood fit, we need to apply a correction to reproduce a good estimate of the x-distribution. This correction consists of adding to the sMn histogram the normalized distributions of each fixed category scaled by the factor c n = N n \u2212 j V nj , where V is the covariance matrix resulting from the fit and N the expected yield of category n. This procedure, which is used in the present analysis to extract the CR signal s Plot, implies that the x-distributions of the fixed categories are well known. The m K\u03c0\u03c0 distributions of the event categories with fixed yields cannot be considered to completely fulfill this criterion since they are taken from simulation. Therefore, we perform a new fit to m ES , \u2206E and F, with all the previously fixed-yield categories merged to a single one to check for possible effects on the parameters of the fit to the m K\u03c0\u03c0 and m K\u03c0 spectra. Since the shape of PDFs for the generic B background and that of the merged category are very similar, we add the former to the latter and consider them as a single \"large background\" category. This way, we can perform a fit with four event categories (i.e. CR signal, continuum, B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (\u2192 K\u03c0)\u03b3 + B 0 \u2192 X sd (\u2192 K\u03c0)\u03b3 and this new large background) where all the yields are left free in the fit. We observe good agreement between the fitted yields in the present and the nominal fit configurations. Thus, we extract the CR signal s Plot distributions, where no corrections need to be applied since no event category yield is fixed in this configuration. We perform a fit to the new m K\u03c0\u03c0 (m K\u03c0 ) s Plot distributions, using the nominal m K\u03c0\u03c0 (m K\u03c0 ) fit model, and take the deviation from the nominal value of each free parameter as the corresponding signed uncertainty.
