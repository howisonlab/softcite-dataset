The \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 candidates are reconstructed in final states with the first tau lepton decaying leptonically, and the second decaying either leptonically or to one or three charged hadrons. The production cross-section is measured for Z bosons with invariant mass between 60 and 120 GeV/c 2 , which decay to tau leptons with transverse momenta greater than 20 GeV/c and pseudorapidities between 2.0 and 4.5. The crosssection is determined to be \u03c3 pp\u2192Z\u2192\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 = 95.8 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 1.1 pb, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, the third is due to the LHC beam energy uncertainty, and the fourth to the integrated luminosity uncertainty. This result is compatible with NNLO Standard model predictions. The ratio of the cross-sections for Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 to Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), determined to be 1.01 \u00b1 0.05 (1.02 \u00b1 0.06), is consistent with the lepton-universality hypothesis in Z decays.",

            "text": "The measurement of the production cross-section for a Z boson 1 using different decay modes in proton-proton (pp) collisions, \u03c3 pp\u2192Z\u2192ff , is an important verification of Standard Model (SM) predictions. The ratio of the Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 production cross-sections to other leptonic decay modes provides a test of lepton universality (LU). The LEP experiments have performed high accuracy tests of LU at the Z pole, with a precision better than 1% [1]. Consequently, the observation in proton-proton collisions of any apparent deviation from LU in Z decays would be an evidence of new phenomena producing final-state leptons, like in the theoretical context of mSUGRA [2], constrained NMSSM [3], Randall-Sundrum models [4,5], or lepton-violating decays of Higgs-like bosons [6][7][8][9][10].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors (PS), an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL).

Chargeconjugate processes are implied throughout. The streams are chosen such that at least one \u03c4 lepton decays leptonically. The tau-pair candidates are selected by triggers requiring muons or electrons with a minimum transverse momentum of 15 GeV/c. The trigger efficiency is between 70% and 85%, depending on the number of leptons in the stream. The final states presented in this analysis account for 58% of all Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays. In the following, a \u03c4 candidate corresponds to a single particle for the \u03c4 e , \u03c4 \u00b5 , and \u03c4 h1 decay channels, or a combination of the three hadrons in the case of \u03c4 h3 . A pair of \u03c4 candidates must be associated to the same PV. In case where multiple PVs are presented in the event, the associated PV is defined as that with a smallest change in vertex-fit \u03c7 2 when it is reconstructed with and without the \u03c4 candidate.",

This process produces two muons or two electrons with similar p T values, in contrast to signal which tends to have unbalanced p T due to the missing momentum from unreconstructed neutrinos and neutral hadrons. The p T asymmetry, A p T , is defined as the absolute p T difference of the two candidates divided by their sum. For the two leptonic streams A p T is required to be greater than 0.1. A particular case is the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 e stream, where background from Vj processes arises, with one lepton coming from the jet causing a relatively large p T imbalance with respect to the lepton from the W/Z boson. A suppression by a factor of two of this source of background, with a loss of 10% of the signal is obtained imposing a maximal A p T value of 0.6. For \u03c4 h1 and \u03c4 h3 the A p T criterion has been found inefficient for background rejection, hence no such a constraint is imposed to these two decay modes.  ",

The smallest value of \u03b5 rec is found to be 9% in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h3 stream, while the largest value is 65% for \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 \u00b5 . The GEC efficiency is determined from Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 decays in data collected with a relaxed requirement. The muon and electron trigger efficiencies are evaluated as a function of \u03b7 and p T using a tag-and-probe method applied on Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 decays. The tracking efficiency for muons uses a tag-and-probe method from Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays in data, whereas for electrons and charged hadrons simulated samples are used. The particle identification efficiency is also obtained by a tag-and-probe procedure.
