Events are collected with a minimum-bias trigger in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV using the CDF II detector at the Tevatron Collider. As pT increases, the slopes of the differential cross sections of the three particles are similar, which could indicate a universality of the particle production in pT . The invariant differential cross sections are also presented for different charged-particle multiplicity intervals.",
