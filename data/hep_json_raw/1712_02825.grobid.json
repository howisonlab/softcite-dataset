One example of such a process is the rare associated production of a single top quark with a Z boson. This production mechanism, leading to a final state with a top quark, a Z boson, and an additional quark, can probe the standard model (SM) in a unique way. The main leading-order (LO) diagrams that contribute to this final state are shown in Fig. 1. Although generically denoted in this Letter by tZq, this process also includes a small contribution from non-resonant lepton pairs, as shown in the lower right-hand diagram in Fig. 1. The process is sensitive to top quark couplings to the Z boson, as illustrated in the middle right-hand diagram in Fig. 1, and also to the triple E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. gauge-boson coupling WWZ, as illustrated in the lower left-hand diagram in Fig. 1.",

In particular, measurements of tZq production are sensitive to processes beyond the SM that have similar experimental signatures, such as flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) involving the direct coupling of the top quark to a Z boson and an up or charm quark, at the top quark production or decay [12,13]. Within the SM, FCNC processes are forbidden at LO and suppressed at higher orders [14]. Deviations from the expected SM tZq production could therefore be indicative of beyond-SM FCNC processes.",

The signature for tZq production consists of a single top quark produced in the t channel, a Z boson, and an additional (\"recoiling\") jet emitted at pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 4.5. The analysis uses events where the Z boson decays to e + e \u2212 or \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , while the W boson, produced in the decay of the top quark, decays to a neutrino and an electron or a muon, resulting in four possible final-state leptonic combinations: eee, ee\u03bc, e\u03bc\u03bc, and \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc. There will also be a small contribution from \u03c4 leptons decaying into electrons or muons. The final result reflects an extrapolation to include all decay modes involving \u03c4 leptons. The measurement is based on a multivariate analysis, where boosted decision trees (BDTs) [20] are used to enhance the signal-to-background separation. Several control regions are defined to better constrain the backgrounds, each containing different contributions from signal and background processes.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The electron momentum is evaluated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons with transverse momentum, p T , around 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [21]. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps [22]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [23].",

The energy of the photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zerosuppression effects, while that of the electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the total energy of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of the muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum, measured in the tracker, and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding ECAL and HCAL corrected energy deposits. For each event, jets are clustered from the PF candidates using the anti-k T algorithm [26,27], with a distance parameter of 0.4. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the jets, clustered with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. All charged particles considered in this analysis are required to be compatible with originating from the primary interaction vertex.",

In addition, nonprompt isolated electrons can arise from the conversion of photons. For simplicity of notation, and given that these background sources are evaluated with similar methods, based on control samples in data, all such sources are referred to as \"not-prompt\" leptons, or simply \"NPL\", in this Letter. Data samples for evaluating the NPL background are built using objects reconstructed similarly to the prompt leptons, with two important differences. First, while the prompt and notprompt leptons are identified using the same variables [21,22] The jet momentum is determined from the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found in simulation studies to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Jet energy corrections are obtained from simulation studies and confirmed with in situ measurements through the balance in dijet, multijet, photon+jet, and leptonic Z+jet events [28]. In the central region, the jet energy resolution is approximately 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Jets reconstructed at angular distances R < 0.4 from the selected leptons are not considered for further analysis. As the region 2.7 < |\u03b7| < 3.0 is particularly affected by noise, events with jets of p T < 50 GeV in that region are rejected.",

First, the predicted shapes of the kinematic variables relevant to the analysis are verified to describe the data in the WZ + light-flavour enriched region. The analysis is then repeated with the WZ + light-flavour normalization relative uncertainty increased to 50%, leaving the results unchanged within about half a percent.

The best-fit signal strength and cross section, as well as an approximate 68% CL interval, are extracted following the profile likelihood scan procedure described in Ref. [48]. The fit is redone without including the systematic uncertainties, to evaluate the statistical uncertainty of the result. The quoted systematic uncertainty is then calculated as the difference in quadrature between the 68% CL intervals obtained in the nominal fit and in the fit without systematic uncertainties. The precision of the measurement is limited by the statistical uncertainty. Among the systematic uncertainties, the dominating ones arise from the normalization of the NPL background (left free in the fit), the scale dependence at the parton shower level, the b tagging efficiency, and the normalization of the ttZ background. The corresponding observed (expected) significance against the background-only hypothesis is 3.7 (3.1) standard deviations, with an observed statistical p-value of 0.0001. The expected significance is estimated from an Asimov toy dataset [49]. The 68% CL interval of the expected significance is 1.4-5.9. Potential biases from the background yields used as input have been searched for. First, the analysis was repeated to measure simultaneously the tZq and ttZ cross sections, in addition to determining the NPL background normalization. The tZq signal strength increases by less than 1%, whereas the observed and expected significances decrease by about 1%. Then, the notprompt muon and electron normalizations are set to their input values, described as the first step in Section 6.2, and allowed to vary in the fit as Gaussian constraints of 100% uncertainty. In this case, both the tZq signal strength and the significances increase by about 10%, while the uncertainties on the signal strength increase by about 5%. In addition, the measurement is repeated in each channel, and the measured signal strengths are found to be 1.32 +1.14 \u22120.99 , 0.66 +0.78 \u22120.63 , 0.01 +0.97 \u22120.01 , and 1.22 +0.75 \u22120.63 for the eee, ee\u03bc, e\u03bc\u03bc, and \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc channels, respectively. The highest observed (expected) significance is 2.1 (1.9) standard deviations in the \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc channel. Finally, the results were verified in a counting analysis, using the yields observed in control regions selected using similar criteria to those of the 1bjet, 2bjets, and 0bjet regions. The simulated backgrounds are normalized according to their SM predictions, while the normalization of the NPL contributions follows the procedure described in Section 6.2 as the first step of the NPL normalization in the shape analysis. The results from the counting and shape analyses are in agreement.",
