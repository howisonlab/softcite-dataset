Alternatively, when using such calculations, the \u039b 0 b may provide a determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) couplings with systematic uncertainties different from the determinations from the decays of B mesons [2]. While the B mesons are well studied, less is known about the \u039b 0 b baryon. Only nine decay modes of the \u039b 0 b have been observed so far, with the sum of their measured branching fractions of the order of only 0.1 and with large uncertainties on the measurements [3]. While theoretical predictions are available for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction [4], no prediction is currently available for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode.

A more detailed description can be found elsewhere [6]. A silicon microstrip detector (SVX and ISL) [7] and a cylindrical drift chamber (COT) [8] immersed in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field allow the reconstruction of charged particle trajectories in the pseudorapidity [9] range |\u03b7| < 1.0 [10]. The SVX detector consists of microstrip sensors arranged in six cylindrical shells around the beamline with radii between 1.5 and 10.6 cm, and with a total z coverage of 90 cm. The first SVX layer, also referred to as the L00 detector, is made of single-sided sensors mounted on the beryllium beam pipe. The remaining five SVX layers are made of doublesided sensors and divided into three contiguous five-layer sections along the beam direction z. The two additional silicon layers of the ISL help to link tracks in the COT to hits in the SVX. The COT has 96 measurement layers between 40 and 137 cm in radius, organized into alternating axial and \u00b12 \u2022 stereo superlayers. The charged particle transverse momentum resolution is \u03c3 pT /p T \u2243 0.07% p T (GeV/c), and the resolution on the transverse distance of closest approach of the particle trajectory to the beamline (impact parameter, d 0 ) is \u224840 \u00b5m, including a \u224830 \u00b5m contribution from the beamline.",

Figure 2(a) shows the m(\u039b  (Fig. 2(a), yellow filled histogram) for the \u039b 0 b candidates from the high-mass sideband of the m(\u039b 0 b ) \u2212 m(\u039b + c ) distribution ( Fig. 1(a)), has negligible statistics in the \u039b * + c signal mass window. The \u039b c (2595) + and \u039b c (2625) + signal yields are estimated with an unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit. The \u039b c (2595) + and \u039b c (2625) + signals are modeled with two non-relativistic Breit-Wigner functions convolved with the same Gaussian resolution function, since the mass difference between the two resonances is tiny. The background is modeled by a linear function. The \u039b c (2595) + natural width is mass dependent to take into account the threshold effects, as reported in Ref. [14], the \u039b c (2625) + natural width and the width of the Gaussian resolution function are free parameters of the fit. Table I reports the estimated signal yields and significances, evaluated by means of the likelihood ratio test, LR \u2261 L/L bck , where L and L bck are the likelihood of the signal and no signal hypotheses, respectively [16]. The combinatorial background is modeled with an exponential function with floating slope and normalization, and the physics background, which is mainly due to semileptonic \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + l \u2212 \u03bd l decays, is derived from simulation and introduced in the fit with fixed shape and floating normalization.
