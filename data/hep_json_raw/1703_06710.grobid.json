Charged Current \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 interactions with the detector under the influence of earth matter effect have been simulated for ten years of exposure. The observed \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events spectrum are separately binned into direction and energy bins, and a \u03c7 2 is minimised with respect to each bin to extract the oscillation parameters for \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 separately. We then present the ICAL sensitivity to confirm a non-zero value of the difference in atmospheric mass squared of neutrino and anti-neutrino i.e. |\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |.",

            "text": "In the last few decades, neutrino oscillation experiments have provided many model independent evidences of neutrino oscillations. It all started in 1998 when Super-Kaimokande observed that the atmospheric muon neutrinos are changing flavor as they traverse through the atmosphere [1,2]. In 2001, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment obtained a direct evidence of a flavor change of solar neutrinos due to neutrino oscillations [3]. Next, KamLand experiment observed the same effect with reactor neutrinos in 2002 [4]. There are now multiple next generation of experiments aimed at studying neutrino oscillation using different neutrino sources. The neutrino oscillations within the three flavor framework is well established from solar, atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, and the oscillation parameters are getting measured with better precision. The evidence of non-zero masses of neutrinos establish the fact that the three flavors of neutrinos are mixed. In the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, neutrino mixing can be described by a 3\u00d73 unitary mixing matrix known as Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix [5,6]. The three flavor eigenstates of neutrinos are mixtures of three mass eigenstates according to the PMNS matrix. Under the standard parameterization of PMNS matrix, the neutrino oscillation probabilities are defined in terms of three mixing angles \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 ; two mass-squared differences \u2206m 2 21 , \u2206m 2",

Any inequality between these disappearance probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos, could therefore, provide a hint for new physics. Also, any difference between the parameters governing the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos could provide a possible hint for CPT violation. We investigate the prospects for the measurement of such a difference in |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | in Iron-Calorimeter (ICAL) experiment at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) [7,8]. A similar work has been carried out by MINOS [9] and Super-Kamiokande [10] experiment. However, in the present work, for the first time, we show the INO-ICAL experimental sensitivity for the difference in |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | irrespective of the theoretical mechanism responsible for the difference in the neutrino and antineutrino parameters.",

The ICAL experiment is sensitive to the atmospheric muon type neutrinos and antineutrinos through their interactions with the iron target producing muons and hadrons via the Charged Current (CC) interactions. The \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 particles are identified by the production of \u00b5 \u2212 and \u00b5 + , respectively, through their CC interaction (\u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) + X \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 (\u00b5 + ) + X ). The energy and direction of the incoming neutrinos/anti-neutrinos has to be measured accurately for the precise measurement of oscillation parameters. The energy and direction of these interacting neutrinos/anti-neutrinos can be determined from the reconstructed energy and direction of muons and hadrons. The muons deposit their energy in iron target forming a clear track-like pattern while hadrons form a shower-like pattern. Further details of the INO-ICAL experiment are provided in Sec. 2.",

Earlier ICAL analysis has shown its potential for measurement of oscillation parameters and mass hierarchy with combined neutrino and anti-neutrino events [11,12,13,14]. The reach of INO-ICAL experiment for CPT violation has also been studied in the litreature [15,16].

The dimensions of the cavern will be 132m \u00d7 26m \u00d7 32m. The ICAL detector will be of rectangular shape of dimensions 48m \u00d7 16m \u00d7 14.5m having three modules. Each module weighing about 17 Kton with the dimensions 16m \u00d7 16m \u00d7 14.5m. Each module will consist of 151 layers of 5.6 cm thick iron plates with alternate gaps of 4 cm where the active detector element will be placed. The ICAL experiment will use Resistive Plate Chambers as active detector element to detect the charged particles produced in the neutrino interaction with the iron nuclei. Since the INO experiment is expected to take data for several years to collect statistically significant number of interactions, the RPCs are a good choice because of their long lifetime [19]. The RPCs will give (X, Y) hit information with 0.96 cm spatial resolution. There will be a total of 30,000 RPCs of dimension 2m \u00d7 2m in the ICAL detector. Another important feature of the INO-ICAL experiment is the application of a magnetic field of 1.5 T that will help in distinguishing the charge of the interacting particles. This distinction is crucial for the precise determination of relative ordering of neutrino mass states (neutrino mass hierarchy) and other parameters.",

            "text": "The magnetized ICAL detector is primarily designed to differentiate the neutrino and anti-neutrino interactions of atmospheric muon neutrinos with excellent charge identification [22]. Since the events at ICAL can easily be separated into samples of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 , they can be used to study oscillations separately in neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. We exploit this feature of ICAL experiment to measure the oscillation parameters independently using \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events assuming |\u2206m 2 32 | = |\u2206m 2 32 |. Next, we explore the ICAL ability to find out any non-zero difference in the atmospheric mass squared differences of neutrinos and antineutrinos i.e. |\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 |\u2206m 2 32 |. For performing the analysis, we generated the atmospheric neutrino data set using HONDA et.al. [24] 3-D neutrino flux with ICAL detector specifications using NUANCE event generator [25]. For final \u03c7 2 analysis, 1000 years equivalent data of 50kt ICAL detector has been scaled down to 10 years exposure to normalize the statistical fluctuations. The ICAL detector is highly sensitive for the CC interactions of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events in the energy range 0.8-12.8 GeV. Therefore, full event spectrum comprises the CC \u03bd \u00b5 (and \u03bd \u00b5 ) events coming from \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) survival channel and from \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) oscillation channel. Initially, each event is generated without introducing oscillations, to reduce the computational time. The effect of oscillations have been incorporated separately using the Monte Carlo re-weighting algorithm described in earlier studies [12,14,13]. For each neutrino/antineutrino event of a given energy (E \u03bd or E \u03bd ) and zenith direction \u03b8 z , three flavor oscillation probabilities are calculated taking earth matter effects into account. The matter density profile of Earth is taken from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model [26] which divides the Earth into several layers according to their matter densities.",

The reconstruction of a neutrino (or anti-neutrino ) event requires the measurement of the secondary particles like muons (or anti-muon) and hadrons. The muons give clear track of hits inside the magnetized detector. Therefore, the energy of these particles can be easily reconstructed using a track fitting algorithm. The complete details of ICAL response for \u00b5 + or \u00b5 \u2212 e.g. energy and direction resolutions, reconstruction and charge identification efficiencies are available in Ref [22]. The ICAL has an excellent charge identification efficiency (more than 98%) and good direction resolution for muons (\u223c 1 \u2022 ) in the energy region of interest. Hadrons deposit their energies in a shower like pattern in the detector. So, total energy deposited by the hadron shower (E had = E \u03bd \u2212 E \u00b5 ) is used to calibrate the detector response. The details of energy resolution and efficiency of hadrons at ICAL can be found in Ref [23]. ",

A total of 20 muon direction bins for cos \u03b8 \u00b5 in the range of -1 to 1, with equal bin width has been chosen.

In this paper, we investigate this possibility by studying INO-ICAL potential for the separate measurements of neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters for 10 years of exposure. The CC \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 events are separated into muon energy, muon direction and hadron energy bins. A \u03c7 2 analysis is used with realistic detector resolutions, efficiencies and systematic errors. The separate analysis for neutrino and antineutrino events having identical oscillation parameters (|\u2206m 2 32 | = |\u2206m 2 32 |, sin 2 \u03b8 23 = sin 2 \u03b8 23 ) indicates that ICAL can measure the atmospheric neutrino parameters |\u2206m 2 32 | with a precision of 10.14% and sin 2 \u03b8 23 with a precision of 27.10%. The atmospheric antineutrino parameters |\u2206m 2 32 | and sin 2 \u03b8 23 can be measured with a precision of 13.4% and 38.0% at 3\u03c3 confidence level respectively. As expected, the combined \u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 events show a better sensitivity with a precision  Further, we investigate the scenario where the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters have different values. We measure the ICAL sensitivity for ruling out the null hypothesis (|\u2206m 2 32 | = |\u2206m 2 32 |) by estimating the difference between the true values of mass squared differences of neutrinos and antineutrinos i.e. 5 Acknowledgment",

This will allow us to either establish or rule out the hypothesis that neutrinos and antineutrinos have same oscillation parameters. We assume that neutrinos and antineutrinos have different true values of mass squared differences (|\u2206m 2 32 |, |\u2206m 2 32 |). All other oscillation parameters are same as in the previous section. We take different representative cases of the true values of |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | and estimate \u03c7 2 as a function of the |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 |.

Here, the null hypothesis line is tangential to 3\u03c3 contour. So, the tangential point is 3\u03c3 away from the central best fit value. Thus, it can be concluded that null hypothesis is ruled out at 3\u03c3 C.L. Similarly, Contour plots at 68%, 90% and 99% C.L. for different true values of |\u2206m 2 32 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | as mentioned inTable 4.
