The analysis uses data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . Events that contain a Z boson candidate decaying leptonically into either e + e \u2212 or \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , a photon, and two jets are selected. The electroweak component is measured with observed and expected significances of 4.1 standard deviations. The fiducial cross-section for electroweak production is measured to be \u03c3 Z \u03b3 jj\u2212EW = 7.8 \u00b1 2.0 fb, in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction.",

Vector-boson scattering (VBS), V V \u2192 V V with V = W /Z /\u03b3 , is one of the most interesting processes to look at to study such effects, as it is sensitive to both the triple and the quartic gauge boson couplings, where physics beyond the SM can significantly alter the SM predictions [1][2][3].",

For such events, the scattered quarks are not colour-connected and little hadronic activity is expected in the gap between the two jets. These events are also characterised by a large invariant mass of the dijet system and a large separation of the two jets in rapidity, while the decay products of the bosons are typically produced in the central region.",

It is not possible to study VBS diagrams independently from other electroweak processes as only the ensemble is gauge invariant [5].

Among all the possible electroweak production modes, only the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 jj and W Z jj production processes have been observed [6][7][8][9]. Evidence for the Z \u03b3 jj channel has been reported [10], while limits on electroweak cross-sections have been reported for the Z Z jj channel [11], the W \u03b3 jj channel [12], and the V V channel [13,14] where at most one of the two bosons decays to two jets.",

Signal events ( \u03b3 jj) were generated [30] at leading-order (LO) accuracy (at order \u03b1 5 EW ) using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3 [31] with no extra parton in the final state. The nominal renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to the transverse mass of the diboson system. The NNPDF30 LO PDF set [32] was used for the generation of the events, and the hadronisation and parton shower of the events was modelled using Pythia 8.212 with the A14 tune [33]. An alternative model of hadronisation and parton shower is obtained by re-showering events with Herwig 7.0.1 [34,35] using the UEEE-5 tune that is based on the models discussed in Refs. [36,37] in conjunction with the CTEQ6L1 LO PDF set [38].",

In 2016, due to the higher instantaneous luminosity, these thresholds were increased to 26 GeV for both the electrons and muons, and tighter isolation requirements were applied. Inefficiencies for leptons with large transverse momenta were reduced by including additional electron and muon triggers that do not include any isolation requirements; these had transverse momentum thresholds of 60 GeV and 50 GeV, respectively. Finally, a single-electron trigger requiring p T > 120 GeV with less restrictive electron identification criteria was used to increase the selection efficiency for high-p T electrons. The threshold was increased to 140 GeV in 2016. In 2015, the dilepton trigger p T threshold was 12 GeV for electrons, and either 10 GeV for muons in conjunction with two muons producing L1 triggers, or 18 GeV and 8 GeV in the case that only one of the two muons produced an L1 trigger. In 2016, these thresholds were raised to 17 GeV for electrons, 14 GeV for the symmetric dimuon trigger, and 22 GeV and 8 GeV for the asymmetric muon trigger. The combined efficiency of these triggers is close to 100% for the events that pass the kinematic requirements described below. To ensure that the trigger efficiency is well determined, the lepton candidates must be matched to the leptons that are selected by the trigger and have a transverse momentum at least 1 GeV above the online threshold.",

Bremsstrahlung radiation by a muon can result in ID tracks and a calorimeter energy deposit that are reconstructed as an electron candidate. Therefore, in cases for which an electron candidate and a muon candidate share an ID track, the object is considered to be a muon, and the electron candidate is rejected. The overlap of objects is measured using the R distance. Due to the isolation requirements placed on electron candidates, any jets that closely overlap an electron candidate within a conical region R < 0.2 are likely to be reconstructions of the electron and so are rejected. When jets and electrons are found within a larger hollow conical region 0.2 < R < 0.4, it is more likely that a real hadronic jet is present and that the electron is a non-prompt constituent of the jet, arising from the decay of a heavy-flavour hadron. Hence an electron candidate found within R < 0.4 of any remaining jet is rejected. Muons can be accompanied by a hard photon due to bremsstrahlung or collinear final-state radiation, and the muon-photon system can then be reconstructed as both a jet and a muon candidate. Non-prompt muons can arise from decays of hadrons in jets; however, these muons are associated with a higher ID track multiplicity than those accompanied by hard photons. In order to resolve these ambiguities between nearby jet and muon candidates, first any jets having fewer than three ID tracks and within R < 0.4 of any muon candidate are rejected, then any muon candidates within R < 0.4 of any remaining jet are rejected. The ambiguity between photons and leptons is resolved by rejecting any photons found to be within R < 0.4 of an electron or a muon. Jets found within R < 0.4 of any photons are rejected.",

In addition, all systematic uncertainties that affect the acceptance and normalisation of the distributions are considered for all processes, except for the theory uncertainties in the signal process, where only the effect on the acceptance is considered. Systematic uncertainties in the shapes of distributions are not applied if they are consistent with statistical fluctuations. The uncertainties in the theoretical modelling of the signal and backgrounds that are estimated from MC simulations can affect the cross-section measurement. The uncertainties due to the knowledge of the PDF and the \u03b1 S value used in the generation of the MC samples are determined using the PDF4LHC prescription [70]. They are found to be of the order of 2% for the normalisation of the QCD and tt\u03b3 samples.

This effect is estimated using the Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3 MC generator at LO in QCD, and is taken as a systematic uncertainty in the shape of the signal. The size of this effect ranges from 5% to 2% at low and high values of the BDT score, respectively. Another source of uncertainty arises from the sizes of the MC samples and data sample in the regions used in the analysis to model the BDT score and N b-jets distributions. The statistical uncertainty in the shape of the BDT score for Z \u03b3 jj\u2212QCD events ranges from 5% to 13% at low and high values of the BDT score, respectively, and is about 2% for Z \u03b3 jj\u2212EW events. For the Z +jets background, the statistical uncertainty dominates the shape uncertainty due to the size of the data sample; it is about 10% at low BDT score values, and up to 50% at high values, while uncertainties from other sources are negligible.

The total effect of the uncertainties related to jet reconstruction and calibration on the normalisation of the Z \u03b3 jj\u2212QCD background is about 8%, and it is about 4% for Z \u03b3 jj\u2212EW events in the signal region.

Uncertainties in the lepton identification, reconstruction, isolation requirements, trigger efficiencies, energy scale and energy resolution are determined by using Z \u2192 events [27,28,74].
