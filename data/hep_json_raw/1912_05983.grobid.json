The BESIII Yellow Book [1] documented the original plan for the BESIII physics program before its commission. The discovery of the Z c (3900) [3], followed by many experimental results on the XY Z hadrons [4][5][6] by BESIII, were pleasant surprises, which were not foreseen in the Yellow Book. Another surprise came from the first systematical absolute measurements of the \u039b + c decay properties based on threshold \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c pair production [7,8]. The physics related to the XY Z hadrons and (heavier) charmed baryons have also become focal points for the Belle II and LHCb experiments, and present exciting area for the BESIII experiment going forward. In addition to these, a full spectrum of other important experimental opportunities, as will be discussed in this White Paper, will be continually pursued by BESIII, such as light hadron spectroscopy and charmed meson physics. The integration of quantum theory and Maxwell's electrodynamics leads to a new, powerful theoretical scenario, i.e., of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which was the first building block of what is called today the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Experimental progress led to the discoveries of new particles, and characterizations of their properties, which helped to develop the theoretical framework further to a common understanding of the weak and electromagnetic interactions, called electroweak theory. The modern theory of the strong interaction, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), was modeled in a similar way on the basis of exact color SU(3) symmetry for the quarks and gluons.",

The strong interaction only allows the existence of composite objects; free quarks and gluons have never been observed. This is called confinement, but it is far from being theoretically understood due to its non-perturbative nature. A detailed study of composite objects and their properties will shed light on this part of QCD. Furthermore, one might suspect that additional features or underlying symmetries beyond the SM might have not been discovered yet, which is usually summarized by the phrase 'new physics'.",

For the heavy-quark mesons, no clearly superfluous or ambiguous hadron states have been reported. Recent discoveries of 'exotic' charmonium-like states have made the picture more complicated [9]. Furthermore, the situation has always been less straightforward for light mesons and baryons containing solely light quarks [10]. Here, the high density of states and their broad widths often make the identification and interpretation of observed signals rather ambiguous. So far the unambiguous identification and understanding of gluonic hadrons is clearly missing. However, the self-interaction of gluons is central to QCD and leads to a flux tube of gluons binding the quarks inside a hadron together. Due to the self-interaction, bound states of pure gluons (named glueballs) or their mixing with conventional mesonic state, should exist as well as socalled hybrids, where quarks and gluonic excitations contribute explicitly to the quantum numbers.",

Charmonium physics received a major renewal of interest when in the 2000's many new, unexpected resonances, called X, Y and Z states [9], were discovered, that could not be accommodated by the quark model. Many of those were found by the Belle, BaBar, CDF, D0 and later the LHC experiments, but only BESIII is dedicated to the energy region where most of these states appear. It is therefore no surprise that detailed studies with much higher statistics can only be performed at BESIII. Nowadays, BESIII is one of the main contributors to the understanding of these XY Z states. At the same time, the high production cross section of charmonia at BEPCII together with a modern, almost hermetic detector for charged and neutral particles, allows also for high-precision studies of light-quark hadrons in the decay of charmonia. Since this decay into light quarks proceeds via gluons, it is likely that the desired studies of gluonic excitations may be performed at BESIII, as will be shown in this White Paper.",

The MDC is a low-mass cylindrical wire chamber with small-cell geometry, using helium-based gas and operating in a 1 T magnetic field. It consists of an inner chamber (8 layers) and an outer chamber (35 layers), which are jointed together at the endplates and share a common gas volume. After many years of running since 2009, the MDC is suffering from ageing problems due to beam-induced background with a hit rate up to 2 kHz/cm 2 [16], which has caused the cell gains of the inner chamber to drop dramatically (about 39% drop for the first layer cells in 2017 as shown in Fig. 1.4), and furthermore has led to a degradation of the spatial resolution and reconstruction efficiency. Because of the radiation damage in the inner chamber, a cylindrical gas electron multiplier (CGEM) has been selected as one of options of the upgrade, due to its attractive features of a high counting rate capability and low sensitivity to ageing. The CGEM inner tracker (CGEM-IT) project deploys a series of innovations and special attributes in order to cope with the    The CGEM-IT consists of three layers of triple cylindrical GEM [17], shown in Fig. 1.5.

To minimize the material budget, no support frames are used inside the active area and the GEM foils are mechanically stretched, being glued to Permaglass rings at their ends. The Permaglass rings are used only outside the active area to operate as gas sealing structure and gap spacers. A sandwich of a PMI foam, called Rohacell, and kapton is used in order to provide mechanical rigidity to the anode and the cathode electrodes. Rohacell is a very light material that limits the material budget to 0.3% of radiation length (X 0 ) per layer.",

A total of 2096 wire holes with a diameter of 3.2 mm were drilled in each endplate with the mean value of the tolerances of 14 \u00b5m. A carbon fiber inner cylinder with a thickness of 1.0 mm, was covered with two layers of 100 \u00b5m thick aluminum foils on its inner surface and outer surface respectively for electromagnetic shielding. The endplates and the cylinder were assembled with a precision better than 30 \u00b5m. Wire stringing was performed after the mechanical structure was assembled. Good quality of wire stringing was achieved by monitoring the wire tension and leakage current during the stringing.

These hardware modifications were completed during the summer shutdown in 2019, while the commissioning will be finished in the end of 2019. However, as expected, running at high energy region above 1.89 GeV, the beam current will decrease due to the limitation of Radio Frequency (RF) power and the difficulty in controlling the bunch length and emittance. Hence, the peak luminosity will go down with the increasing beam energy, which is shown in Fig. 1.15.

This is 10 times higher than the achieved luminosity of BEPCII at the beam energy of 2.2 GeV. The crabwaist collision with large Piwinski angle is suggested to be adopted with the parameter modifications of the BEPCII. The \u03b2 functions at the interaction point would be modified from 1.0 m/1.5 cm to 0.14 m/0.8 cm in the horizontal and vertical plane, respectively. The emittance is reduced from 140 nm to 50 nm with the damping wigglers. Regarding to this proposal, a detailed design with crab-waist scheme has been studied. From the study, many physical and technical issues are investigated, such as injection, dynamic aperture, emittance coupling, high power RF, super-conducting quadrupoles/wigglers, and strong crab sextupoles etc. Finally, it is found that the crab-waist scheme is a complicated and time-consuming project and not practical with the present BESIII detector.",

            "text": "Another economic way to increase luminosity is by raising up beam current, which would potentially gain a factor of 2 improvement of peak luminosity. For this purpose, one needs to suppress bunch lengthening, which require higher RF voltage. The scenario of expected luminosity, beam current and SR power is shown in Fig. 1.16. The RF, cryogenic and feedback systems need to be upgraded accordingly according to the higher beam current. Nearly all the photon absorbers along the ring and some vacuum chambers also need to be replaced in order to protect the machine from heat of SR. The budget is estimated to be about 100-200 million CNY and it will take about 3 years to prepare the upgraded components and 1 year of installation and commissioning. This upgrade scheme with higher beam current is more realistic at present than the crab-waist scheme. 1x10 33 1.2x10 33 1.4x10 33 1.6x10 33   ",

In the high energy regime, asymptotic freedom of the partons constituting hadrons allows systematic calculations in QCD using perturbation theory. In the low-energy regime where the energies are (much) smaller than a typical strong interaction scale, there are well-established theoretical methods, chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In the intermediate-energy regime, the non-Abelian character of QCD requires a non-perturbative approach which must rely either on lattice QCD (LQCD) or on QCDinspired models. Therefore, the study of light hadrons is central to the understanding of confinement physics.",

The radiative decays of the J/\u03c8 meson provide such a gluon-rich environment and are therefore regarded as one of the most promising hunting grounds for glueballs. Recent LQCD calculations predict that the partial width of J/\u03c8 radiatively decaying into the pure gauge scalar glueball is 0.35 (8) keV, which corresponds to a branching ratio of 3.8(9) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [14]; the partial decay width for a tensor glueball is estimated to be 1.01 (22) (10) keV which corresponds to a large branching ratio 1.1(2)(1) \u00d7 10 \u22122 [15]; the partial decay width for a pseudoscalar glueball is estimated to be 0.0215 (74) keV which corresponds to a branching ratio 2.31(80) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [16]. With the unique advantage of high-statistics J/\u03c8 sample, a systematics research program of glueballs has been performed at BESIII. The pseudoscalar sector draws special attention due to the small number of expected resonances of the quark model. However, experimental input is very limited for now and the hope is in BESIII for significant improvements. In the scalar sector and tensor sector already a large number of resonances is observed. However, the nature of all of these states is still controversial, but the program at BESIII can provide crucial information to map out the scalar and tensor excitations.",

However, the extra state appears to be relatively far from the expected mass of the pseudoscalar glueball of 2 GeV/c 2 . This is known as the long standing \"E-\u03b9 puzzle\" [24]. BESIII reported the first observation of the isospin-violating decay \u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 (980) in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b33\u03c0 [25], together with an anomalous lineshape of the f 0 (980), as shown in Fig. 2.3. The f 0 mass, deduced from a Breit-Wigner fit to the mass spectra, is slightly shifted compared to its nominal value, with a width of < 11.8 MeV (90% C.L.), much smaller than its nominal value. The observed isospin violation is (17.9 \u00b1 4.2)%, too large to be explained by f 0 (980)-a 0 (980) mixing, also observed by BESIII [26,27]. Based on this observation, Wu et al. [28] suggest that a triangular singularity mixing \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 and K * K could be large enough to account for the data. The splitting of \u03b7(1405) and \u03b7(1475) could also be due to this triangle anomaly.",

An easy way to avoid mixing with regular mesons are additional degrees of freedom leading to exotic quantum numbers. Such degrees of freedom could arise from explicit gluonic contributions. Those particles carry a special name and are called hybrids. In many models, some of the hybrid mesons can have a unique signature, the already mentioned exotic (not allowed in a simple qq system) J P C quantum numbers. This signature simplifies the spectroscopy of such exotic hybrid mesons because they do not mix with conventional qq states. LQCD calculations support the existence of exotic-quantum-number states within the meson spectrum, independent of specific models.

These two states, with similar masses but different decay modes and isospins, are difficult to accommodate in the traditional quark-antiquark model, and many alternative formulations have been proposed to explain their internal structure, including tetra-quarks [37][38][39][40][41], KK molecule [42], or quark-antiquark gluon hybrid [43]. Further insights into a 0 (980) and f 0 (980) are expected from their mixing [44]. The mixing mechanism in the system of a 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) is considered to be a sensitive probe to clarify the nature of these two mesons. In particular, the leading contribution to the isospin-violating mixing transition amplitudes for f 0 (980) \u2192 a 0 0 (980) and a 0 0 (980) \u2192 f 0 (980), is shown to be dominated by the difference of the unitarity cut which arises from the mass difference between the charged and neutral KK pairs. As a consequence, a narrow peak of about 8 MeV/c 2 is predicted between the charged and neutral KK thresholds. The corresponding signal is predicted in the isospin-violating processes of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6a 0 0 (980) [45,46] and \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 (980) [47]. The signals of f 0 (980) \u2192 a 0 0 (980) and a 0 0 (980) \u2192 f 0 (980) mixing are first observed in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c6a 0 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c0 0 and \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 a 0 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at BESIII [26,27]. The statistical significance of the signal versus the values of g a 0 K + K \u2212 and g f 0 K + K \u2212 is shown in Fig. 2.5. The regions with higher statistical significance indicate larger probability for the emergence of the two coupling constants. This direct measurement of a 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) mixing is a sensitive probe to the internal structure of those ground state scalars and sheds important light on their nature. The new results from BESIII provide critical constraints to the development of theoretical models for a 0 (980) and f 0 (980).",

This observation was later confirmed by BESIII [49]. The X(1835) was also observed in the \u03b7K 0 S K 0 S channel, where its spin-parity was determined to be J P = 0 \u2212 by a PWA [50]. An anomalously strong enhancement at the proton-antiproton (pp) mass threshold, dubbed X(pp), was first observed by BES in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp decays [51]; this observation was confirmed by BESIII [52] and CLEO [53]. This enhancement was subsequently determined to have spin-parity J P = 0 \u2212 by BESIII [54]. Using a highstatistics sample of J/\u03c8 events, BESIII studied the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process and observed a significant abrupt change in the slope of the \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution at the proton-antiproton (pp) mass threshold [55]. Two models are used to characterize the \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line shape around 1.85 GeV/c 2 : one which explicitly incorporates the opening of a decay threshold in the mass spectrum (Flatt\u00e9 formula) ( Fig. 2.6(a)), and another which is the coherent sum of two resonant amplitudes( Fig. 2.6 (b)). Both fits show almost equally good agreement with data, and suggest the existence of either a broad state with strong couplings to the final state pp or a narrow state just below the pp mass threshold. The goodness-of-fit are equivalent for both fits. One supports the existence of a pp moleculelike state and the other a bound state with greater than 7\u03c3 significance. Further study of the fine lineshape of X(1835) in other decay modes will provide conclusive information on the nature of the state.",

Since baryons represent the simplest system in which all the three colors of QCD neutralize into colorless objects, understanding the baryon structure is absolutely necessary before we claim that we really understand QCD. Given many recent experimental results, our present understanding of baryon spectroscopy is clearly incomplete. Many fundamental issues in baryon spectroscopy are still not well understood [57,58]. Most important among them is the problem of missing resonances: in quark models based on approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry it is expected that resonances form multiplets; many excited states are predicted which have not been observed (for a review see Ref. [59]). More recently, LQCD calculations [60] have also predicted a similar pattern as quark models. The possibility of new, as yet unappreciated, effective symmetries could be addressed with the accumulation of more data. The new symmetries may not have obvious relation with QCD, just like nuclear shell model and collective motion model.",

The key to success lies in high statistical precision complemented with sophisticated analysis methods. PWA or amplitude analysis techniques are the state-of-the-art way to disentangle contributions from individual, and even small, resonances and to determine their quantum numbers. Multiparticle decays are usually modeled using the phenomenological approach of the isobar model, which describes multiparticle final states by sequential two-body decays into intermediate resonances (isobars), that eventually decay into the final state observed in the experiment.

Such a model-independent description allows the experiment-theory cooperation to develop phenomenological models, which can then be used to fit experimental data in the future. Global studies in different reactions and kinematics across experiments are also needed to clarify the underlying production mechanisms.",

The first class consists of hadronic decays into three pseudoscalar mesons, such as \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0. Those processes are already included in the lowest order, O(p 2 ), of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [67].

The primary requirement for the data taking of light hadron program at BESIII is to have sufficient high-statistics J/\u03c8 events for the systematic study of glueballs. The pseudoscalar glueball is clearly the main focus of research with its production rate in radiative J/\u03c8 decays predicted to be O(10 \u22124 ) by LQCD. A major difficulty for the identification of glueballs is the lack of firstprinciple theoretical predictions of glueball couplings and decay rates. Due to the \"flavourblindness\" of gluons, there will be no dominant decay mode of a glueball. The decay rate of a glueball into a certain final state may be estimated to be at the level of O(10 \u22123 ) \u223c O(10 \u22122 ) in analogy to \u03b7 c or \u03c7 c0,2 decays. But mixing with ordinary mesons complicates the situation in the light-quark mass range. The detection efficiency of a typical decay mode of a pseudoscalar glueball is estimated to be a few percent from simulation studies. Recently, a new decay mode of X(2370) has been observed in the spectrum of \u03b7 KK of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 KK. We performed a feasibility study for determination of the spin-parity of X(2370). The neutral channel J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 K 0 S K 0 S provides a clean environment to perform the amplitude analysis as it does not suffer from significant backgrounds such as J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 K 0 S K 0 S , which are present in the charged channel J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 K + K \u2212 . MC samples with statistics equivalent to current data and 10 billions of J/\u03c8 are generated with a certain set of amplitude parameters. Amplitude analyses have been performed to the MC samples with various hypothesis. Table 2.4 shows that the spin-parity of X(2370) can be unambiguously determined with higher statistics of data. BESIII accumulated 10 billion J/\u03c8 events, which are mandatory for mapping out the spectrum of light hadrons in J/\u03c8 decays. In addition, \u03c8(3686) decays have larger phase space for studying mesons and baryons with higher mass, even though the production rates of light hadrons are typically suppressed with respect to J/\u03c8. \u03b7 c and \u03c7 c events from \u03c8(3686) decays can also provide an opportunity for investigating QCD exotics. Currently, BESIII collected 450 million of \u03c8(3686) events. The light hadron physics program can be benefit from the high statistics \u03c8(3686) data set for the charmonium program in the future.",

Definitive conclusions on the nature of confinement will need complementary studies with these experiments. Key features of these experiments are high statistics and high sensitivity to explore hadron spectroscopy. COMPASS [87] has comprehensively studied a J and \u03c0 J -like mesons up to masses of 2 GeV/c 2 in diffractive scattering of hadron beams. GlueX [88] is designed to search for and measure the spectrum of light-mass hybrid mesons. It begun its physics run in 2017 and will start a high luminosity run with an updated detector in 2019. An important advantage of this experiment is the use of polarized photons, which simplifies the initial states and production process. PANDA [89] is designed for high-precision studies of the hadron spectrum at cms energies between 2.3 and 5.5 GeV. It is scheduled to start data taking with full setup in 2026. In pp annihilations, spin-exotic states (e.g., oddballs) can be produced. Belle II [72] will start collecting data in 2019, and will accumulate 50 ab \u22121 data at the \u03a5 (4S) peak by 2027. Although not its primary goal as a next generation flavour factory, Belle II can also explore the light quark sector using the two-photon process, because a glueball should have suppressed couplings to \u03b3\u03b3. Hadronic decays of heavy hadrons may also serve as a well-defined source for light mesons. BESIII remains unique for studying and searching for QCD exotics and new excited baryons, as its high-statistics data sets of charmonia provide a gluon rich environment with clearly defined initial and final state properties.",

The spectrum of charmonium states with masses below the open charm threshold has been well-established for several decades. These states can therefore be used to precisely test predictions based on various theoretical techniques, ranging from models (like the quark model) to approximations of QCD (like non-relativistic QCD, described below) to numerical calculations of the full QCD Lagrangian (i.e., LQCD). The fact that the energy scales range from the charmonium mass to \u039b QCD in charmonium processes make them a rich laboratory to probe both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD [2].",

Their existence therefore provides a crucial opportunity to study the dynamics of quarks and gluons in a new environment.

            "text": "The charmonium meson system is an ideal, and to some extent unique, laboratory to investigate the boundary between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD in a controlled environment. Since reliable calculations of non-perturbative QCD are still difficult, several phenomenological models and effective theories have been proposed. These models and calculational techniques can be tested and further developed using the phenomenology of charmonium states. For example, non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [9][10][11], expressed as a Pauli two-component field theory, can be constructed in correspondence with the hierarchy of energy scales in charmonium. NRQCD can be regarded as an effective theory that expands full QCD in powers of v, where v is the relative velocity between the c and c quarks. According to potential model calculations and lattice simulations, v 2 \u223c 0.3 in the charmonium system [12]. For small v, multitude energy scales are observed as the hard m c , soft m c v, and ultra-soft m c v 2 , respectively. The effects at energy scale m c can be integrated out explicitly. The resultant theory, NRQCD, reduced in the number of dynamical degrees of freedom, is simpler than full QCD, and it turns out to be very useful in calculating charmonium-relevant processes such as inclusive production, and annihilation decays and spectroscopy. Starting from NRQCD one can obtain the effective theory potential NRQCD (pNRQCD) [13][14][15] by integrating out the scale m c v. Here the role of potentials and the quantum mechanical nature of the problem can be reduced to the zeroth order Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the two heavy quarks. These effective field theories, as well as potential models and LQCD, make it possible to calculate a wide range of charmonium observables in a controlled and systematic way, therefore allowing an investigation of one of the most elusive sectors of the SM: low-energy QCD.",

            "text": "These charmonium observables can be taken from spectroscopy (e.g., masses and widths), transitions (e.g., transition rates), leptonic and electromagnetic decays, radiative decays, hadronic decays, rare and forbidden decays, and some miscellaneous topics such as Bell inequalities in high energy physics and special topics in BB final states, where B refers to baryon. BESIII is well suited to address the remaining experimental questions that are related to the low-mass, i.e. below open-charm threshold, charmonium spectrum, such as precise determinations of the mass and width of the \u03b7 c , h c , and \u03b7 c . The QCD multipole expansion (QCDME) [16,17] is a feasible approach to charmonium hadronic transitions. Its results can be examined via observations at BESIII such as \u03c0\u03c0 transitions of S-Wave (P -Wave or D-Wave) charmonium states, the \u03b7 transition \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8, and iso-spin violating \u03c0 0 transition \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 h c . Many radiative transition channels, including E1 (electric dipole) and M 1 (magnetic dipole) transitions, can be investigated with the BESIII \u03c8(3686) data sample using the cascade transition chain. Other EM related processes, such as charmonium leptonic and EM decays, can also be studied at BESIII. In addition, studies of the hadronic decays will shed light on the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c0 puzzle [18] and reveal the inertial structure and decay dynamics of charmonium states. The baryonic decays are a special topic since the structure of baryons is comparatively more complicated than that of mesons. BESIII can investigate the baryonic decays via two-body, threebody, multi-body, and semi-inclusive modes. With a large \u03c8(3686) data sample, BESIII can also search for rare and forbidden charmonium decays to explore some interesting topics such as CP violation or lepton flavor violation.",

For example, for the observation of the \u03b7 c (2S) decaying into some channel with the production branching fraction B (\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S)) \u00d7 B (\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 K S K3\u03c0) of about 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , a 10 9 \u03c8(3686) sample is needed with the assumption that the detection efficiency is about 5%, where the low efficiency and high background levels are due to the softness of the transition photon. With this large sample, we could also study the \u03b7 c charmonium state via M 1 transition to improve the precision of B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) and its comparison with theoretical predictions. A measurement of B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S)) could be used to extract the absolute branching fractions for some specific \u03b7 c (2S) decays. There are other radiative transitions such as \u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8, \u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3h c , \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03b3h c , and h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,1 that are challenges for BESIII even with 10 9 \u03c8(3686) data sample because of low decay rates or difficulty in detecting the soft photon, but these rates can be calculated in the potential model [1] and experimental searches are therefore important.",

This means a 10 9 \u03c8(3686) data sample would be needed to observe the signal if we assume the intermediate product branching fractions are 80% and the selection efficiency is 30%. Since the branching fractions for \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3V are expected to be similar to \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, they should be at the 10 \u22124 level. And the improved measurement of \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 will shed light on the effects of higher order QCD corrections as well as provide validation of the decoupling of the hard and soft contributions in the NRQCD framework due to its simplicity [28,29].

But this relation is observed severely violated for the \u03c1\u03c0 and several other decay channels. From already obtained BESIII results, it has become more clear that kinematic effects, which have been previously ignored, might contribute significantly and the amplitude analysis method might also be necessary to clarify the different dynamic processes between the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686). For charmonium states beyond the open-charm threshold, the studies of their decays to open-charm states will not only provide information of the decay mechanism, but also serve for the spectroscopy study.

Before the discovery of the X(3872) in 2003 [44], every meson in the mass region between 2.9 and 4.5 GeV/c 2 could be successfully described as a cc bound state. Simple potential models, using QCD-inspired potentials binding quarks and antiquarks, could reproduce the spectrum of charmonium states all the way from the \u03b7 c (1S) (the ground state) up to the \u03c8(4415) (usually considered to be the third radial excitation of the J/\u03c8) [6]. This simple model of the charmonium spectrum has since broken down in a dramatic fashion. Following the discovery of the XY Z states (Fig. 3.1), we now observe exotic hadronic configurations containing charm and anticharm quarks. These new configurations, such as tetraquarks, hadronic molecules, and hybrid mesons, allow us to probe the mysterious nonperturbative QCD which underlies the way quarks and gluons combining into larger hadronic composites.",

Its unexpected appearance, combined with its narrow width and the fact that its mass is very close to the D 0D * 0 mass threshold, immediately signaled that the X(3872) is an unusual meson. Since its discovery, many more of its properties have been determined [3]. For example, its total width is less than 1.2 MeV/c 2 , its mass is within 0.18 MeV/c 2 of the D 0D * 0 threshold, it has J P C = 1 ++ , and in addition to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, it decays to D 0D * 0 with a large branching fraction, \u03b3J/\u03c8, \u03b3\u03c8(3686) and \u03c9J/\u03c8.

Moreover, since that time a better candidate for the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) state, the X(3860), has been discovered [48] (see also in Ref. [49]). This leaves the nature of the X(3915) an unsettled question. Searching for the X(3915) in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3915) is currently an important topic at BESIII.

Because of its production mechanism, we can immediately infer that it has J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 . However, its mass is inconsistent with any of the known or expected charmonium vector excitations. For example, its mass lies between the masses of the \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415). It is therefore supernumerary. LQCD calculations [52], as well as other models [53], suggest the Y (4260) could be a hybrid meson. Another intriguing model that considers the Y (4260) to be strongly coupled to D 1 (2420)D predicts a nontrivial behavior for its line shape [54]. At BESIII, the Y (4260) can be produced directly by simply tuning the cms energy of the e + e \u2212 collisions to the mass of the Y (4260). In the same way, BESIII can also directly produce the Y (4360) (seen in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686)), and can search for new Y states. The BESIII discovery of a multitude of new Y states (or the discovery of a complicated coupled-channel system) will be further described in the next section (Sec. 3.3.1).",

The lineshape of the Z c (3900) and how that shape evolves with cms energy will be one of the keys to its interpretation.

Since this is the reaction that led to the discovery of the Y (4260) (although here Initial State Radiation is not used), the aim of our measurement was to precisely determine the parameters of the Y (4260). Instead, what we observed was a cross section that was inconsistent with that arising from a single ordinary resonance, as shown in Fig. 3.10(e). The cross section could be successfully fit using two resonances: one with a narrow total width and mass around 4.22 GeV/c 2 and one with a wider total width and mass around 4.32 GeV/c 2 . Thus, the Y (4260), one of the first of the XY Z to be discovered, is either composed of two resonances or has a highly nontrivial line-shape due to other dynamics such as a strong coupling to the D 1 (2420)D. In addition, we observed the decay Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and the neutral Z c (3900) in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 Z 0 c \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 [61].

A summary of the masses and widths of resonances extracted from recent BESIII results is shown in Fig. 3.11. There is currently very little consistency between different reactions.

This is the \"Y \" problem. Are the many peaks seen in e + e \u2212 cross sections really new states? Or are they the results of more subtle effects? With new data, will new patterns emerge? What are their exact line shapes? Will they match theoretical predictions, such as a very asymmetric line shape for the Y(4260) obtained within a molecular frame [69]? With our limited number of data points (cms energies), there is little hope in resolving the issue. We require (1) more data spread over a variety of cms energies, and (2) a global and simultaneous analysis of many final states.

Such an effort to measure the Argand diagram for the Z c (3900) is currently being explored. Determining the lineshape of the Z c (3900) and studying its phase motion would allow us to distinguish between different models for the nature of the Z c (3900) [71]. There are at least two challenges. First, a larger data sample at a single cms energy is required. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we must understand all of the other resonances that are present in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 Dalitz plots. The measurement of the phase of the Z c (3900) (and even the magnitude of its amplitude) is only as good as our understanding of the parameterization of the rest of the Dalitz plot. This is a challenging issue.",

We require on the order of 5 fb \u22121 or more per point to have adequate statistics for unambiguous Dalitz plot analyses. Three or four of these high-statistics points would likely reveal the nature of the energy dependence of the Dalitz plot. A working group is studying the substructure within various channels using the 4.42 GeV data. As the working group progresses, the requirements on future data-taking will become more clear. The lower part of Table 3.2 lists the expected numbers of events for a few channels given future 5 fb \u22121 data samples.  If BESIII will take data above 4.6 GeV, a number of new exciting possibilities would become accessible. Here we list five cases. 1We know there is an unexplained peak at 4.66 GeV in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) cross section. BESIII would be able to produce and study it directly. 2We could also study the peak at 4.63 GeV in the \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c cross section. 3We could search for new peaks; it seems likely that more than those two exist. These three goals would extend our study of the Y problem. (4) Production of a Z cs tetraquark candidate in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 KZ cs with Z cs \u2192 KJ/\u03c8 would require cms energies above 4.6 GeV if the Z cs is near the D sD * or D * sD threshold. (5) Data significantly above 4.6 GeV provide access to additional charmed baryon thresholds. BESIII would thus be able to study charmed baryons in a uniquely clean environment. (6) Data above 4.6 GeV would provide a unique opportunity to search for the excited 1 +\u2212 h c state, expected to be around 3.9 GeV and show up in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7DD * .

While the measurement of exclusive hadronic channels is needed for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , the inclusive measurement of the hadronic cross section above 2 GeV can be used to improve the knowledge of the fine structure constant at the Z-pole. The latter is currently limiting precision tests in the electroweak sector of the SM. Thus, its improvement is of central importance for the physics programs at future high-energy electron-positron colliders, such as Higgs factories [2,3]. The exclusive channels can be measured at BESIII via the initial state radiation (ISR) technique, while the accuracy of the inclusive R-measurement will be further improved with respect to measurements at BES and KEDR. Regarding (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , BESIII can also measure the transition form factors of pseudoscalar mesons, as motivated by the hadronic light-by-light scattering contributions to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 . The analysis of the high-statistics energy scan between 2.0 and 4.6 GeV allows for a first precision measurement of neutron and hyperon form factors. In the case of hyperons, their self-analyzing decay does not only provide access to the absolute values of the electric and magnetic form factors, but it allows even to extract the relative phase between them. A complementary view on hadron structure is possible through the measurement of Collins asymmetries. The recent result obtained at BESIII extends previously available knowledge, which was restricted to measurements at B factories, towards lower energies. The picture of the non-perturbative features of QCD can be further extended by the investigation of fragmentation functions.",

The leading contribution to the HLbL diagram is given by the coupling of photons to the pseudoscalar mesons \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 as well as channels like \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0\u03b7, as shown in Fig. 4.9. So far, hadronic models have been used for the calculation of the HLbL diagram. Although most groups report similar values for the absolute size of the HLbL contribution, the assumed uncertainties differ largely. The calculation with the lowest uncertainties stems from Prades, de Rafael, and Vainshtein [12]. They find the following value: a HLbL \u00b5 = (10.5 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . Very recently, new theoretical approaches have been proposed by groups from Bern and Mainz [13][14][15][16][17][18][19] in order to attack the HLbL calculation, namely by exploiting dispersion relations. Form factor measurements of the two-photon coupling \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 P , where P is a one-hadron or two-hadron system, are of special interest. The Belle and BaBar collaborations have determined these couplings referred to as meson TFF for the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. However, the results of the B-factories have only been obtained at very large momentum transfers above 2 GeV, while for the HLbL contribution measurements at low momentum transfers are required. This is illustrated by Fig. 4.5, which shows the weight of the light pseudoscalar TFFs in the HLbL calculation [20] as a function of the two virtualities Q 1 and Q 2 of the photons. It can clearly be seen that the region of small momentum transfers is most relevant. This is exactly where BESIII can provide precision result.",

In the white paper of Ref. [21] in 2013, it was argued that new experiments, like the ones carried out at BESIII, should lead to a final reduction of the SM uncertainty of a \u00b5 down to 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . The recent evaluations in Refs. [5,7,22] show that such an accuracy has almost been achieved already. BESIII have contributed to this achievement. The future program of BESIII together with new analyses at BaBar, Belle II, and elsewhere will lead to an additional significant reduction. The midterm goal is to reduce both the HVP and HLbL uncertainties to a level similar to the future experimental uncertainty, i.e., 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . It should also be mentioned that since 2017 the theoretical and experimental work in view of a SM \u00b5 is coordinated by the g \u2212 2 Theory Initiative [23], which is a consortium of theoretical and experimental physicists working towards an improved SM prediction.

The current uncertainty of \u2206\u03b1 em represents a severe limitation for electroweak precision fits to the SM (see a review on Electroweak model and constraints on new physics in Ref. [24]). Typically these fits are performed using three independent input variables, such as \u03b1 em (M 2 Z ), the Fermi constant G \u00b5 , and M Z . Among these three quantities, \u03b1 em (M 2 Z ) is known with the least precision. Its relative uncertainty is 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , while G \u00b5 and M Z are known with uncertainties of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , respectively. In the past, the insufficient knowledge of \u2206\u03b1 em led to imprecise predictions of the Higgs mass. Now that the Higgs mass is known with high accuracy, any new precision measurement of an electroweak observable (as for instance the electroweak mixing angle sin 2 (\u0398 W )) establishes a significant test of the electroweak SM. The smaller the uncertainty of \u2206\u03b1 em (M 2 Z ) is, the more powerful this test will be. As will be discussed in Sec. 4.2.4, the goal of the new BESIII measurement is to reduce the uncertainty of the R measurement to 3%, which allows to improve the accuracy of the predition of \u2206\u03b1 had(5) em .",

Although tagging of those photons is not feasible, the momentum information can be extracted from the missing momentum of the fully reconstructed hadronic system.

In this energy range the two-pion channel indeed contributes more than 50% to a HVP \u00b5 , and the uncertainty of this exclusive channel is therefore decisive for the SM error of (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 . Thus, this is the flagship analysis of the BESIII ISR program. A total systematic uncertainty of 0.9% for the cross-section measurement has already been achieved. The two limiting contributions to the total systematic uncertainty are from the luminosity measurement and the theoretical radiator function, with 0.5% for each. As will be discussed below, with improved calculations of the radiator function, by including larger data sets, and by an overall improved understanding of the detector performance, the errors of both these contributions can be reduced from 0.5% to 0.2% for each, yielding a reduced total systematic uncertainty. The mass range studied in this analysis is accessible via the tagged ISR approach only. The same holds for the mass range from the dipion mass threshold to 600 MeV, which will be studied in future, along with the mass range above 900 MeV, where the investigations can be performed in the untagged ISR approach as well.",

[5] uses in the dispersive evaluation inclusive R values measured above 1.937 GeV. In the energy interval from 1.8 to 3.7 GeV, the contribution to the uncertainty of the muon anomaly a \u00b5 is found to be 0.56 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , which is roughly a factor of 3 smaller than the expected accuracy \u03b4a \u00b5 (exp) = 16 \u00d7 10 \u221211 of the new direct measurements of a \u00b5 . In Ref. [7] fourloop pQCD is used in the energy region between 1.8 and 3.7 GeV, resulting in a theory uncertainty of 0.65 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . The open charm region between 3.7 and 5 GeV is governed by broad resonances. Its contribution to a \u00b5 is computed with experimental data. However,  the contribution is found to be very small (0.11 \u00d7 10 \u221210 in Ref. [5] and 0.03 \u00d7 10 \u221210 in Ref. [7]). At even higher energies, either experimental data (for instance in the bottomonium region) or pQCD are used for the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization. The uncertainties of these contributions are below the level of 0.10 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . The transition region between sum of exclusive channels and inclusive R data, is of interest and deserves re-examination. Table 4.1 summaries the a HVP,LO \u00b5 at [1.841, 2.0] GeV by different inputs in this region [5]. The results from inclusive data and pQCD calculations agree within uncertainty, and disagree with that from exclusive sum. Hence, precise measurements of R data with exclusive sum and inclusive method are important to choose transition point between sum of exclusive channels and inclusive R data, and test pQCD prediction on R value in transition region. A new scan measurement between 1.8 and 2.0 GeV is useful to answer these questions.",

In fact, in the case of \u2206\u03b1 em , the total uncertainty of 1.11 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cited in Ref. [5] stems almost entirely from the energy range between 1.19 and 11.20 GeV, which amounts to (82.82 \u00b1 1.05) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . While Ref. [5] follows a more data-driven approach to calculate \u2206\u03b1 em , the evaluation by Davier et al. in Ref. [7] relies on pQCD calculations for the R value in the energy range between 1.8 and 3.7 GeV. Above 3.7 GeV, up to 5.0 GeV, experimental information on R is used. In this energy range an experimental uncertainty of 0.67 \u00d7 10 \u22124 out of a total uncertainty for \u2206\u03b1 em of 0.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 is found. This strongly motivates new data on the inclusive R ratio in the energy range covered by BESIII. The role of BESIII is twofold: on the one hand the data can prove the validity of pQCD in the description of R as required by a theory-based evaluation of \u2206\u03b1 em ; On the other hand the data can be directly used as input in the dispersion integral in a data-driven approach.",

The total hadronic event yield exceeds 10 5 events at each energy, such that the accuracy of the data will be entirely dominated by systematic uncertainties. The goal of the BESIII experiment is to arrive at a total accuracy of the hadronic R ratio of at least 3%. A similar systematic accuracy has already been achieved in Ref. [48] at KEDR. The analysis of the data is currently ongoing, and preliminary result showes dominant uncertainy is by hadronic event generator, which is also a major challenge to describe 10 5 hadronic events at each energy. MC simulation programs based on theoretical descriptions of string fragmentation functions exist, like the LuArLw generator [50]. The KEDR collaboration used LuArLw generator, which was employed by the BES collaboration. With 10 5 hadronic events at each energy, the LuArLw generator is optimized and tunned. At the same time, a precise description of the total hadronic events in one event generator has been proposed. Making use of the existing measurements of many exclusive hadronic final states, event generator ConExc [51], which can deal with imprecise exclusive part of the LuArLw generator, have been considered as an alternative. Hence, a more data-driven approach to the description of the total hadronic events is identified.",

Unlike the HVP contribution, in most of the existing estimates of the HLbL contribution, the description of the non-perturbative light-by-light matrix element is based on hadronic models rather than determined from data. These approximations are based on a requirement of consistency with the asymptotic constraints of QCD, and predict that the hadronic corrections are dominated by long-distance physics, namely due to exchange of the lightest pseudoscalar states. Unfortunately, a reliable estimate based on such models is possible only within certain kinematic regimes. This results in a large, mostly uncontrolled uncertainty of a \u00b5 . In order to reduce the model dependence, data-driven approaches for the HLbL contribution to a \u00b5 have been proposed. Sum rules and a dispersive formalism can furthermore provide powerful constraints on the hadronic light-by-light scattering and its contribution to a \u00b5 . Measurements of meson TFFs are used as input in such data-driven approaches. As will be discussed below, essentially all the relevant channels in the spacelike and timelike regions can be studied at BESIII.",

In the limit of massless light quarks (u, d, s), i.e., the chiral limit, the QCD Lagrangian exhibits an SU(3) L \u00d7 SU(3) R chiral symmetry which is spontaneously broken to SU(3) V , giving rise to 8 pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons (\u03c0, K, \u03b7). The QCD Lagrangian has in addition two other global symmetries: the U(1) V symmetry leading to the conservation of baryon number, and the U(1) A symmetry which is anomalous. Since the flavor-singlet axial-vector current is not conserved in the presence of this U(1) A anomaly, the \u03b7 mass does not vanish in the chiral limit. In the massless u, d, s quark world (with the other three quarks infinitely heavy), the massive \u03b7 would be a pure flavor-singlet state \u03b7 0 \u2261 (u\u016b + dd + ss)/ \u221a 3. In the real world, however, the SU(3) V flavor symmetry is explicitly broken by the quark masses, which causes a mixing among \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, and \u03b7 [55]. In the isospin limit (m u = m d ), the \u03c0 0 can be identified as a pure isotriplet state (u\u016b\u2212dd)/ \u221a 2. In the absence of the U(1) A anomaly (large-N c limit of QCD), the two isosinglet pseudoscalar mass eigenstates would consist of (u\u016b + dd)/ \u221a 2 and ss (so-called ideally mixed states). The U(1) A anomaly mixes these quark flavor states towards the physical \u03b7 and \u03b7 mesons, which are closer to the flavor octet \u03b7 8 \u2261 (u\u016b + dd \u2212 2ss)/ \u221a 6 and flavor singlet \u03b7 0 states, respectively. This mixing in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 system is probing the strange quark content of the light pseudoscalars as well as the non-perturbative gluon dynamics of QCD, responsible for the U(1) A anomaly. The mixing can also be related to physical observables [55][56][57], in particular through the M \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay widths and the \u03b3 * \u03b3 * M TFFs.",

Preliminary results for the analysis are presented in Fig. 4.11. As described above, for single-tag events, one of the beam particles (electron or positron) is tagged in the detector. By detecting two photons from the \u03c0 0 decay, the missing momentum can be derived for the missing positron (electron), which is further required to be scattered at very small angles. By fitting the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass distribution in bins of Q 2 , one obtains the differential cross section d\u03c3/dQ 2 for the signal process,which is proportional to |F (Q 2 )| 2 . Figure 4.11 shows the product Q 2 |F (Q 2 )| as measured by BESIII together with existing data from CELLO [58] and CLEO [59]. Note that recent BaBar [60] and Belle [61] data could only access the Q 2 range above 4 GeV 2 , and hence, are not displayed. The BESIII analysis covers the entire Q 2 range between 0.3 GeV 2 and 3.1 GeV 2 , which significantly improves the accuracy upon existing data sets. The accessible range of momentum transfer is limited by the detector acceptance for the decay photons of \u03c0 0 at lowest values of Q 2 and by statistics at largest values of Q 2 . Existing data taken in the scope of the R measurement, discussed in Sec. 4.2.4, will be used to extend the covered regions of momentum transfers down to approximately 0.1 GeV 2 . A future data set of additional 20 fb \u22121 at 3.773 GeV will help to extend the covered range of momentum transfer up to approximately 10 GeV 2 , which will allow to test the discrepancy in the results of the B-factories, i.e., the so-called BaBar-Belle puzzle.",

            "text": "The inner structure of baryons can be described and studied experimentally on a common footing through electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), probed by processes involving hadrons interacting with virtual photons. The EMFFs are fundamental observables of non-perturbative QCD and quantify the deviation from the pointlike case. If one-photon exchange is assumed, the momentum transfer squared q 2 of the virtual photon is given by q 2 = (p i \u2212 p f ) 2 < 0. Elastic, or spacelike, form factors (q 2 < 0) have been studied since the 1960's in electron-nucleon scattering [78]. Spin 1 2 baryons have two form factors, often referred to as the electric G E and the magnetic G M form factor. In the so-called Breit frame, these are Fourier transforms of the charge-and magnetization density, respectively. The measured charge density of the neutron is particularly intriguing: though being negative near the center whilst positive further out can be explained in the simple quark model by d-quarks clustering in the center surrounded by the u-quark, the drop to negative values at even larger distances from the center requires more elaborate models involving e.g., pion clouds [72]. One way to gain further insights into this puzzle is to replace one or several of the light quarks in the nucleon by heavier ones, i.e., forming hyperons, and study how the structure changes [79]. However, since hyperons are unstable, they are unfeasible as beams or targets, and therefore, do not easily lend themselves to electron scattering experiments. Instead, their structure can be studied in the timelike region (q 2 > 0) through the electron-positron annihilations, with the subsequent production of a baryon-antibaryon pair.",

In particular, spacelike and timelike form factors should converge to the same value as |q 2 | reaches a certain scale [81]. For nucleons, the onset of this scale can be tested by measuring the spacelike and timelike form factors with great precision and compare them. For hyperons, this is unfeasible due to the poor experimental access to the spacelike region. However, one can utilize the fact that timelike form factors can be complex, with a relative phase that polarizes the final state [81]. For a ground-state hyperon Y , this phase is accessible, thanks to the weak, self-analyzing decays. The daughter baryon B will be emitted according to the spin of the mother hyperon Y , giving a decay angular distribution that depends on the polarization of Y :",

Hence, the onset of the scale, at which spacelike and timelike form factors converge to the same value, can be obtained by finding the scale at which the phase goes to zero. Also at threshold, the relative phase must be zero. This is because the phase is a result of interfering amplitudes, e.g., s-waves and d-waves. At threshold, only s-waves can contribute which means that the phase is zero. Furthermore, the absence of other waves also imply that the ratio between the electric and the magnetic form factor, i.e., |G E /G M | is equal to 1 at threshold.",

This is primarily due to the difficulty in identifying and reconstructing the neutron and antineutron from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 nn process. The cross section has been measured by the SND [110] experiment up to 2 GeV and by the FENICE experiment [? ] between 2 and 3 GeV. FENICE collected only a small amount of data and identified then by the time-of-flight method and the annihilation pattern in the detector. The ratio R np = \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 nn) / \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp) is expected to be close to 1 if the process is dominated by the isoscalar or isovector amplitude. In a picture where the production cross section is proportional to the square of the leading quark charge (u quark in the case of the proton and d quark in the case of the neutron), the ratio should instead be close to 0.25. More elaborate predictions are presented in Refs. [111,112]. More precise data could shed further light on this issue.",

However, in a more recent measurement from BESIII, dedicated data at q = 2.396 GeV/c enabled a complete spin decomposition of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b reaction, including measurement of the polarization and spin correlations. From this, it was possible to not only separate between the \u039b electric and magnetic form factors, but also to determine the relative phase between |G E | and the |G M | for the first time. It was found to be significantly different from zero [119]. The prospect of measuring the relative phase \u2206\u03a6 of the \u039b hyperon by BESIII have triggered the first theory predictions based on various \u039b\u039b potential models [120]. It was found that the phase is more sensitive to the potential than the |G E /G M | ratio, that in turn is more sensitive than the cross section. The theory predictions, as well as the measured values, are shown in Fig. 4.14. Note that the theory predictions were made assuming the old PDG value (from before 2019) of the \u039b decay asymmetry parameter, \u03b1 \u039b = 0.642. The data are therefore rescaled to the old value. In Ref. [119], the phase is obtained with the 2019 update of the \u03b1 \u039b from PDG, \u03b1 \u039b = 0.750.",

In this measurement, as well as in measurements of the proton and \u039b hyperon EMFFs near threshold, interesting features can be discerned: the cross section undergoes a sharp rise close to threshold, followed by a plateau in the case of the positively charged proton [94,98,123] and \u039b + c [122], as shown in Fig. 4.15. Various FSI models have been employed to explain this behavior [105].

For example, while the quark content of the \u039b and the \u03a3 0 is the same, the isospin of the ud pair is different. As a consequence, the spin structure should be different. In the case of the \u03a3 + , the isospin of the uu pair should be the same as that of the ud pair in the \u039b. As a consequence, the cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 +\u03a3\u2212 should be similar, as observed by CLEO. However, measurements should be performed at energies that do not coincide with charmonium resonances in order to avoid interference effects. Furthermore, spin observables should be more sensitive to the underlying quark structure, and therefore, it would be illuminating to study the EMFF phase for different octet hyperons. For the \u03a3 triplet, simulation studies show that q = 2.5 GeV/c is optimal in terms of cross section and reconstruction efficiency to collect a sample of the required size. The simulation studies show that 100 pb \u22121 would yield a sufficient amount of events to extract the phase of \u03a3 + and \u03a3 0 .

The analysis of these data, as well as simulations at other energy points, show that data samples of \u2248100 pb \u22121 are required to achieve the necessary sample size.

This possibility is particularly valuable close to threshold. Special event selection techniques are required in the analysis of energy scan data, due to the low momenta of the outgoing particles. Due to the boost of the ISR photon, the respective baryons have larger momenta in the laboratory frame and can be detected more easily. Additionally, it is currently technically challenging to acquire energy scan data in the threshold region of nucleon production, due to the design of the accelerator. However, away from threshold, the statistical precision is generally better when using the energy scan method, as can be seen for example in a comparison of the proton EMFF studies using the ISR method [97] and the energy scan method [131]. Measurements of the form factor ratio and its relative phase benefit from data collected at well-defined energies with the scan method.

A precise determination of fragmentation functions could help to understand the internal structure of the nucleon. The strange quark polarization puzzle, i.e., the polarization of the strange quark is positive in the measured region of Bjorken x by semi-inclusive DIS analyses, where inclusive DIS yields significantly negative values of this quantity. It is pointed out in Ref. [139] that the polarization of the strange quark extracted from semi-inclusive DIS analyses is very sensitive to the input fragmentation functions. The semi-inclusive DIS process is used to study the proton spin at the upgraded JLab-12 [140] and the future Electron-Ion Collider [141]. Thus, a better knowledge of fragmentation functions is needed.",

The pure leptonic or semileptonic character of \u03c4 decays provides a clean laboratory to test the structure of the weak currents and the universality of their couplings to the gauge bosons.

The third region is above the \u03c4 pair production threshold, which can be further classified into two cases. The one case is below the production of open charm, say 3.69 GeV, where the background is same as described at the below threshold region; the other is at 4.25 GeV, where the cross section of \u03c4 pair production is at the maximum, while charm background should be considered in addition to the light quarks background. Figure 4.18 shows the production cross section and R ratio for \u03c4 pairs in the region of BEPCII. The luminosity at the \u03c4 lepton threshold is about 0.3 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 .

[163] 414 fb \u22121 Pseudo-mass acquired at the B-factories is employed [163]. Good statistical accuracy is achieved, but large systematic uncertainty exists, which is mainly due to the absolute calibration of the particle momentum. For the threshold-scan method, the value of m \u03c4 was extracted from the dependence of production cross section on the beam energy. In the KEDR experiment [164], both, the resonant depolarization technique and the Compton backscattering technique [171] are used to determine the beam energy. All these techniques greatly decrease the uncertainty of beam energy.",

Additional data taking will not improve the result. For the threshold-scan method, however, both the statistic and systematic errors still seem to have room for further improvements. Therefore, the BESIII collaboration adopted the threshold-scan method to measure the m \u03c4 . In this approach it is of utmost importance to determine the beam energy and the beam energy spread precisely. For this purpose, starting from the year 2007, a high accuracy beam energy measurement system (BEMS) located at the north crossing point (NCP) of BEPCII was designed, constructed, and finally commissioned at the end of 2010 [172][173][174][175][176]. Two days were spent to perform a scan of the \u03c8(3686) resonance. The mass difference between the PDG value in 2010 and the one measured by BEMS is 1 \u00b1 36 keV, the deviation of which indicates that the relative accuracy of BEMS is at the level of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [175].",

Figure 4.20 shows predicted strangeonium states [196] with identified ss resonances [24]. Only 10 probable ss resonances out of the 22 expected below 2.2 GeV are established. A candidate for an exotic type of hadronic matter containing strange quarks is the \u03c6(2170). At BESIII the \u03c6(2170) can be studied as an intermediate state in charmonium decays, exploiting the unique statistics of the J/\u03c8 data set, and by performing a dedicated energy scan around the mass of the \u03c6(2170).

The main decay modes in tetraquark pictures [208] are \u03c6\u03b7 and \u03c6\u03b7 modes; the predicted decay width of a 1 \u2212\u2212 ssg state to \u03c6\u03b7 is much larger than that of \u03c6\u03b7 [205,215], whereas \u03c6\u03b7 is forbidden for 2 3 D 1 ss states [201]. However, the uncertainty of the cross section of \u03c6\u03b7 around \u221a s = 2.2 GeV measured by BaBar is at the 50% level [216]. A clear signal of \u03c6\u03b7 is observed by BaBar in Ref. [217]. A precise measurement of \u03c6\u03b7 and \u03c6\u03b7 modes at BESIII is useful to distinguish tetraquark, hybrid and 2 3 D 1 pictures of the \u03c6(2170). Besides \u03c6(2170), there is another possible structure for \u03c6f 0 (980) and K + K \u2212 f 0 (980) around 2.4 GeV [197][198][199]. BaBar determined its mass and width as (2.37 \u00b1 0.07) GeV/c 2 and (77 \u00b1 65) MeV, while Ref. [218] obtained (2436 \u00b1 34) MeV/c 2 and (99 \u00b1 105) MeV, respectively, whose statistical significance is smaller than 3\u03c3. A QCD sum rule also predicts two J P C = 1 \u2212 ",

The results are already competitive with previous measurements of hadronic cross sections. However, one of the key issues, the hadronic contributions to a \u00b5 , is still unsettled. The published BESIII result on the dominating \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 contribution is currently dominated by systematics, where the largest contributions stem from the uncertainties of the luminosity determination and the theoretical uncertainty of the radiator function. An alternative approach to the normalization of the cross section can reduce the systematic uncertainty. Using the ratio to the muon cross section cancels the two uncertainties mentioned above. However, due to an insufficient muon yield in the current data set, the statistical uncertainty becomes dominant. Based on the performance of the published work, it is estimated that an additional data set of 20 fb \u22121 , taken at the \u03c8(3770) peak, and data set listed in Chapter 3 for XYZ physics, will allow to collect sufficient statistics to perform the normalization of the hadronic cross sections with respect to the muon yield. The systematic uncertainty of the pion form factor measurement could be reduced to O(0.5%), making the BESIII result not only comparable, but competitive to the KLOE, the BaBar, and the announced CMD-3 measurements as well as potential future analyses at Belle II.",

While \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 , as well as pion pairs can be studied very well in a single-tag measurement using the existing data, the statistics is rather scarce for higher mass resonances, or a doubletagged measurement of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. However, the latter two are of special interest in order to understand the hadronic light-by-light contribution to a \u00b5 at the level of the new direct measurements at FNAL and J-PARC. An additional data set of 20 fb \u22121 at \u221a s=3.773 GeV is most beneficial for the TFF measurements at BESIII for two reasons, On the one hand it increases the statistics at large invariant masses of the produced hadronic systems, and on the other hand it will allow to perform the first measurement of the doubly-virtual TFF, in the energy region most relevant for the a \u00b5 calculations, with sufficient statistical precision to scrutinize hadronic models and provide valuable input to the new, data-driven theory approaches to a hLBL \u00b5 . The scan measurements performed at BESIII have successfully allowed to determine baryon EM FFs at the respective thresholds and revealed puzzling features. In order to shed more light on these aspects, further detailed studies on enhanced data sets around the nucleon threshold at cms energies between \u221a s = (1.8, 2.0) GeV, the \u039b\u039b threshold at 2.2 GeV, and the \u039b c\u039bc threshold at 4.58 GeV are necessary. So far, most emphasis has been put on the investigation of EM FFs of nucleons and the \u039b hyperon. An additional integrated luminosity of 100 pb \u22121 at \u2248 2.5 GeV allows not only precision studies of the \u039b, but also of \u03a3 0 with 6% statistical uncertainty, and \u03a3 \u00b1 with 4% statistical uncertainty, including the measurement of their effective form factors, their |G E /G M | ratios, and the phase angle between G E and G M for \u039b and \u03a3 + hyperons.",

Furthermore, as the strong force is always involved in the decays of the charmed hadrons and the formation of the final-state hadrons, precise measurements of the decay properties allow tests of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The decay rates of the ground states of charmed hadrons are dominated by the weak decay of the charm quark. For comparison, the lifetimes of the charmed hadrons are shown in Fig. 5.1(a); it is surprising that their individual lifetimes differ by up to a factor of 10. As shown in Fig. 5.1(b), the ratio of \u03c4 (D + )/\u03c4 (D 0 ) = 2.54 \u00b1 0.01 is very different from that for the corresponding lifetimes in the beauty sector, \u03c4 (B + )/\u03c4 (B 0 ) = 1.076 \u00b1 0.004. From these observations one can infer that deviations of the lifetime ratios from unity decrease with increasing heavy-flavor quark mass m Q . Heavy flavor decays thus constitute an intriguing lab to study QCD. According to the data, the nonperturbative effects in the decays of the charmed hadrons are much more important than those in the beauty sector. Comprehensive studies of the decays of charmed mesons and baryons will play an essential role in furthering our understanding of strong interactions. In particular, understanding the different decay mechanisms, such as weak-annihilation, W -exchange and final-state scattering, is essential for developing a complete theory of charmed hadron decays. Therefore, the data at the BESIII experiment will have a leading role in understanding non-perturbative QCD.",

We also discuss possible energy upgrade of the BEPCII up to 5 GeV, so that the thresholds will be open for baryon pair productions of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 c\u03a3c and \u039e c\u039ec . ",

Experimental studies of D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 with \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd \u03c4 , \u03c4 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd e , \u03c4 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd \u00b5 , and \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03bd \u03c4 are still ongoing. Based on existing measurements at CLEO-c [7][8][9], BaBar [10], and Belle [11], the expected signal yield of D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 will be larger than that of D + s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 , but will have more background and significant systematic uncertainties. After weighting the measurements performed with different \u03c4 + decays, the sensitivity of the result for D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 will be comparable to that made with D + s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 . Thus, the measurement precision with D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 can be estimated, as summarized in Table 5  measurements by various experiments and the values evaluated in LQCD. Focusing initially on f D + , it may be seen that BESIII currently supplies the most precise individual measurement, which itself has a statistical uncertainty of around 2.5%. In contrast to the LQCD uncertainty of 0.2%, there is much room to be improved in experiment. With 20 fb \u22121 of data at 3.773 GeV, the relative statistical uncertainty on f D + can be reduced to approximately 1%, which is still larger than the current systematic uncertainty.",

This motivates the exploration of taking data at \u221a s = 4.009 GeV where only D + s D \u2212 s production is possible; such a data set will have much reduced backgrounds in the double-tag method, thus improving the systematic uncertainties on the measurements. The drawback is the reduction in cross section by a factor of three with respect to operation at 4.178 GeV. Therefore, a data set of 20 fb \u22121 would be required to match the statistical precision of 6 fb \u22121 of data at 4.178 GeV across all measurements of D + s decay. Such a large set corresponds to many years of data taking and as such cannot be considered as the highest priority among the various charm-physics data sets requested.",

Degree-level precision on \u03b3 will allow a rigorous comparison of the loop and tree-level determinations of the UT. The independence from loop diagrams means that the measurement of \u03b3 has negligible theoretical uncertainty [49]. The precision measurement of \u03b3 is one of the top priorities for the LHCb upgrade(s) and Belle II experiments. The most precise method to measure \u03b3 is based upon the interference between B + \u2192 D 0 K + and B + \u2192 D 0 K + decays [50][51][52]. In the future, the statistical uncertainties of these measurements will be greatly reduced by using the large B meson samples recorded by LHCb and Belle II, and by extending these measurements to other similar B modes such as B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 , where D implies either D 0 orD 0 , B + \u2192 D * K + , B + \u2192 DK\u03c0\u03c0, and B + \u2192 DK * + [53,54]. However, with increased statistical precision, limited knowledge of the strong phases of the D decays will systematically restrict the overall sensitivity. Consequently, improved knowledge of the strong-phase related parameters in D decays is essential to make measurements of \u03b3 to degree-level precision. Strong-phase information in the following D decay modes has been obtained from the CLEO-c experiment and has been used in the most recent \u03b3 measurements:",

It should be noted that the precision on the D \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 phase is dominated by the combination of charm-mixing measurements at the LHCb, CDF experiments and the B factories [29] and so here the role of threshold data is less important. Recently, BESIII reported the strong-phase measurement of D \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays [62] and the preliminary results of the strong-phase measurements of D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [63] from current \u03c8(3770) data with an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb \u22121 . The precision of these measurements demonstrated the powerful capabilities of BESIII to determine strong-phase parameters accurately. However, all the current strong-phase measurements are still limited by the size of the \u03c8(3770) data. Therefore, one of the most important goals of the BESIII charm physics program is to improve the strong-phase measurements with a larger \u03c8(3770) data. For the existing determination of \u03b3 that is made by combining the CP-violation sensitive observables from different D modes in B \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * ) decays, the uncertainty arising from the CLEO-c inputs has been found to be about 2 \u2022 for LHCb. The current BESIII \u03c8(3770) data is approximately four times larger than that of CLEO-c. The full analysis based on it gives in general a factor of 2.5(1.9) more precise results for c i (s i ), which reduces its contribution to the uncertainty on \u03b3 to 0.7 \u2022 [63] at most. As evident from Table 5.3, this precision should be adequate for the LHCb Run-2 measurement, but will not be sufficient for the future LHCb upgrade and Belle II era, in particular because these strong-phase uncertainties will be largely correlated between the two experiments for each mode. To minimize the impact of the strong-phase measurement uncertainties for these next generation experiments, a much larger \u03c8(3770) data at BESIII, ideally corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb \u22121 , is essential, as BEPCII is the only machine working at the charm-threshold energy region. Furthermore, determining these parameters with radiative return events to the \u03c8(3770) at Belle II will not be achievable with suitable precision even with a data set of 50 ab \u22121 . A 20 fb \u22121 sample of \u03c8(3770) data would lead to an uncertainty of approximately 0.4 \u2022 for the \u03b3 measurement, which will be necessary for the goals of LHCb upgrade I and Belle II. Moreover, this improved precision will be essential to allow the even larger data of LHCb upgrade II [64] to be fully exploited in improving further the knowledge of \u03b3 and allowing detailed comparison of the results obtained with different decay modes. A reasonable time frame for taking the \u03c8(3770) data of 20 fb \u22121 would be by 2025, when Belle II will have completed accumulation of its 50 ab \u22121 of data and LHCb upgrade I will be mid-way through its period of operation.",

Table 5.4 lists the decay modes of interest that can be measured at BESIII. Furthermore, for the multi-body D final states the phase-space binning schemes that could be employed are mentioned; increasing the number of bins improves the statistical sensitivity of the measurements as the amount of information loss relative to an unbinned method is reduced. The modes are listed in their approximate order of importance for LHCb measurements.

Without loss of generality, the V CKM can be parameterized in terms of three mixing angles and one phase [75] V where c ij \u2261 cos \u03b8 ij and s ij \u2261 sin \u03b8 ij (for ij = 12, 23 and 13). The irremovable phase \u03b4 is the unique source of CP-violation in quark flavor-changing processes within the SM. Following the observation of a hierarchy between the different matrix elements, Wolfenstein [76] proposed an expansion of the CKM matrix in terms of the four parameters \u03bb, A, \u03c1, and \u03b7, which are widely used in contemporary literature, and which is the parameterization employed in CKMfitter [77]. The allowed region in the \u03c1 and \u03b7 space can be elegantly displayed by means of the UT described by the rescaled unitarity relation between the first and the third column of the CKM matrix (i.e., corresponding to the b-meson system).

At that time, the collected data amount for LHCb will be 23 fb \u22121 [79] and for CMS/ATLAS 300 fb \u22121 , which is after Run 3 and prior to the start of the HL-LHC. We also take into account the prospective accuracies for Belle II at 50 ab \u22121 [54] already at Phase I. The individual constraints as well as the combination from the usual observables are shown for 2025 in the (\u03c1 cu , \u03b7 cu ) plane in Fig. 5.5. One can also transfer the constraints to the (|V cs |, |V cd |) plane as shown in Fig. 5.6, which clearly shows the direct contribution from the BESIII measurements of |V cs | and |V cd |, and allows precise tests of the consistency of CKM determination from different quark sectors.",

            "text": "With 20 fb \u22121 of data at 3.773 GeV and 6 fb \u22121 around 4.178 GeV at BESIII, many D (s) decays are expected to be measured with an uncertainty of about 1%, which will then be limited by the systematic uncertainties related to particle reconstruction in the different final states. Improved measurements of these absolute BFs at BESIII will be highly beneficial to some key measurements at LHCb, since it is expected that the uncertainty of the reference mode will become the dominant uncertainty in several measurements. One prime example is the LHCb measurement of B \u2192 D * \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 , which is used to test lepton universality [53]. BESIII can make precise measurements of the BFs for D 0 , D + s , and D + inclusive decays to three charged pions and to the neutral particles, and exclusive decays to final states with neutral kaons and pions (e.g., D + s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , D + \u2192K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and D 0(+) \u2192 \u03b7X, X denotes any possible particle combinations), which will have a significant impact on optimizing the background models. Another example is the determination of the CKM matrix elements S X and D (s) \u2192 K 0 L X are not expected to be equal. The recoil-mass method, or that developed in Ref. [86], allows the efficient reconstruction of D (s) \u2192 K 0 L X decays at BESIII. A difference of about 10% has been observed in D 0 \u2192 K 0 S,L \u03c0 0 decays at CLEO-c [86] and has been confirmed at BESIII [87]. The two-body decays D 0 \u2192 K 0 S,L X (X = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 , \u03c9, \u03c6) are expected to have an asymmetry under the same mechanism [88], which can be tested with the current \u03c8(3770) data, but the uncertainties will be dominated by statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, measurements of these modes are of interest in understanding the width difference in the neutral D system [89]. With the future 20 fb \u22121 and 6 fb \u22121 of data taken at \u221a s = 3.773 and 4.178 GeV, these measurements will be performed with much better precision.",

            "text": "Studies of charm baryons have been ongoing since 1975 [90], with all ground states of singly charmed baryons, as well as some excited states, having been observed. The constituents of the lightest charmed baryon (\u039b + c ) are one diquark (ud) and one heavy charm quark (c), where, relative to the heavy quark, the light diquark is in a net quantum state of spin zero and isospin zero. In a naive spectator model the \u039b + c decays dominatedly through the weak amplitudes c \u2192 W + s and c \u2192 W + d at leading order, which leads to a simpler theoretical description in non-perturbative models than in the case of charmed mesons. Hence, studying \u039b + c decays allows a deeper understanding of strong and weak interactions in the charm sector, which is complementary to that provided by charmed mesons. In addition, the \u039b + c is the cornerstone of the charmed baryon spectra. Improved knowledge of \u039b + c decays is essential to the studies of the whole charmed baryon family. Furthermore, this knowledge will provide important information to the studies of beauty baryons that decay into final states involving \u039b + c . Compared to the significant progress in the studies of charmed mesons (D 0 , D + , and D + s ) in both theory and experiment, the advancement of our understanding of charmed baryons has been relatively slow during the past 40 years. Until 2014, no absolute measurements of the decay rates of the \u039b + c had been performed, with almost all these rates having been measured relative to the normalization mode \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , whose BF suffered from a large uncertainty of 25%. This overall situation has changed since 2014, when BESIII collected a data set of e + e \u2212 annihilation at \u221a s = 4.6 GeV, corresponding",

Meanwhile, another SCS mode \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e can be searched for in the enlarged data set. The hadronic weak decay of a singly charmed baryon is expected to violate parity conservation. For instance, the two-body decay, \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + , proceeds via a W -interaction, c \u2192 W + + s, in which parity is not conserved. The \u039b and \u03c0 + particles are allowed to be in an S-or P -wave state. The effects of parity violation are determined from the polarization of the charmed baryons, which is characterized by the angular distribution of the \u039b in the \u039b + c rest frame, taking the form of dN d cos \u03b8 \u039b \u221d 1 + \u03b1 \u039b\u03c0 cos \u03b8 \u039b , where \u03b1 \u039b\u03c0 is the decay asymmetry parameter [111,112]. In addition the decay asymmetry allows discrimination between different theoretical models, as listed in Ref. [112]. Some decay asymmetry parameters, e.g., \u03b1 \u039b\u03c0 for \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + , \u03b1 \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 for \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c0 0 , and \u03b1 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + for \u039e 0 c \u2192 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + , have been studied previously, but with limited precision [2]. Therefore, improved measurements are desirable, as they will shed light on the decay mechanism and allow searches for CP asymmetries in the charmed baryon sector. In addition, more decay  asymmetry parameters in \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 0 \u03c0 + , pK 0 , and \u039e 0 c \u2192 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + can be accessed. Based on the sensitivity with the current BESIII data set, a 16\u00d7 larger data set would result in an approximate precision of 4% and 6% for measuring \u03b1 \u039b\u03c0 + and \u03b1 \u03a3 0 \u03c0 + , respectively.",

Such samples at threshold allow a double-tag technique to be employed where the full event can be reconstructed, even if it contains one undetected particle such as a \u03bd or K 0 L meson. These samples provide a unique environment to measure the absolute BFs of charmed hadrons to leptonic, SL and hadronic final states, with very low levels of background. Such measurements provide rigorous tests of QCD, CKM unitarity and LFU that complement similar studies of beauty hadrons. Furthermore, the 20 fb \u22121 of data of coherent \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0D0 events allow measurements of the strong-phase difference between the D 0 andD 0 that are essential inputs to determining the UT angle \u03b3 in a model-independent fashion from B decays at LHCb and its upgrades, as well as at Belle II. These strong-phase differences can only be determined using this data set to the required level of precision. In addition, these strong-phase measurements are important ingredients of model-independent measurements of D 0D0 mixing and searches for indirect CP violation in D 0 decay. Finally, there are additional studies of charmed baryons that can be performed related to their electromagnetic form factors and, if the BEPCII cms energy is upgraded, studies of the absolute BFs of \u03a3 c and \u039e c . Table 5.7 presents the precision prospects on some key measurements in D 0(+) , D + s , and \u039b + c based on the proposed data set, and a comparison with Belle II. ",

BESIII has already published some NP search results based on the existing data sets. There are still some unique opportunities worth further exploring. In general, NP searches at BESIII could be classified into three broad categories, which are demonstrated in this chapter: Processes that involve flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions that change charm quantum number by one or two units do not occur in the SM at tree level. However, these transitions can happen in the SM at loop levels, which makes them rare. Such processes can receive NP contributions from both tree-level interactions mediated by new interactions, and loop corrections with NP particles. Inclusive and exclusive transitions mediated by c \u2192 u\u03b3 or c \u2192 u \u00af will be discussed in Sec. 6.2.2.

For instance, the branching fractions of J/\u03c8 inclusive weak decays are estimated to be of the order of 10 \u221210 [2]. As mentioned in Refs.

Several NP models, such as the top-color model, the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with R-parity violation and a general two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), allow \u03c8(nS) flavor-changing processes to occur with branching fractions around 10 \u22126 [3,4].

The absence of a super-heavy down-type quark in the SM implies that Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani cancellation mechanism is very effective, making the charm sector of special interest in probing for NP. The predicted short-distance (SD) contributions of the SM for FCNC in the charm sector are well beyond the sensitivity of current experiments.

Such decays could be interesting probes of NP, especially in light of renewed interest to lepton flavor universality (LFU) studies in B decays. While SM interactions in general respect LFU, recent experimental observations (see, e.g., [17]) show hints of LFU violation in rare semi-leptonic decays of B mesons. Theoretically, such violation could come from new lepton-flavor non-universal interactions [18], which might also be detectable in D-decays [19].

However, the CKM mechanism for CP violation in the SM fails to fully explain the puzzle of the matterantimatter asymmetry by more than 10 orders-of-magnitude [42]. This suggests that additional, heretofore undiscovered, CP violating processes exist, and has motivated aggressive searches for new sources of CP violation in b-quark decays and neutrino oscillations [43]. CP violation in charm decay is very small and had not yet been found until the discovery in 2019 at LHCb. LHCb finds non-zero CP violation in D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays with a significance of 5.3\u03c3. The time-integrated CP asymmetry is given as",

Based on the same Cut and Count (CC) analysis technique, with the assumption of similar efficiencies, we can make a projection of future BESIII sensitivity in this channel. By constructing cocktail samples from the 1.3 \u00d7 10 9 data set, and then performing toy MC (pseudo-experiment) studies, the sensitivity with 10 10 J/\u03c8 events is evaluated. The 90% C.L. upper limits on the numbers of signal events are estimated according to the recoiled \u03c4 mass distributions. With 10 10 J/\u03c8 decays, the projected sensitivities of the two channels are estimated to be both at 10 \u22128 level. Such results would represent an improvement of almost two orders of magnitudes compared to those obtained at BESII. The systematic uncertainties have also been estimated, and are expected to be sub-dominant even for this very large sample. With more advanced analysis techniques such as multivariate analyses (MVA), the efficiencies could be increased with decreased background levels which results in even better sensitivities. The current and future BESIII constraints on B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 1 2 ) are summarized in Table 6.7. Based on these projections, the resulting constraints on the combination of Wilson coefficients and NP scale \u039b, both current and projected, can be found in Table 6.8.",

In 2008, the PAMELA collaboration reported an excess of positrons above 10 GeV [104], which has now been confirmed by many other experiments, such as ATIC [105], Fermi-LAT [106] and AMS02 [107]. In a class of models, DM particles with masses of O(TeV) annihilate into a pair of light bosons with masses of O(GeV), which subsequently decay into charged leptons [108,109]. An exchange of light bosons would increase the dark-matter annihilation cross section, allowing the observations of anomalous cosmic-ray positrons to be explained. Moreover, if the mediator is light enough, no extra anti-proton will be produced due to the kinematics. This feature is consistent with the PAMELA antiprotons data.

Some models predict that the mass of the dark photon is at the scale from O(MeV) to O(GeV) [110,111]. The kinetic mixing coupling \u03ba is taken to be very small. Similarly to the case of neutral-meson mixing, the introduction of the term mixing A \u00b5 and V \u00b5 implies that neither of the fields is a mass eigenstate. Diagonalizing the Lagrangian [110,112] introduces a small coupling g between the new, weakly-interacting vector field V \u00b5 , g \u2248 \u03bae, where e is the electric charge. Thus, dark photons can be searched for in the decays of charmed particles [112] and/or charmonia. The structure of the Dark Sector can be complicated, possibly with a class of light particles including scalars, pseudo-scalars, gauge bosons and fermions at the GeV scale. Since the interaction between the Dark Sector and the SM sector is very weak, the constraints on the mixing parameter and dark photon mass mainly come from the intensity frontier, such as the measurements of electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments, low-energy electron-positron colliders, beam-dump experiments and fixed-target experiments [102,103].",

It is interesting to note that this result is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding decay of an Upsilon state [117]. Similarly, the SM branching fraction of radiative decays of J/\u03c8's with missing energy is also very tiny [118]. Thus, we may neglect neutrino-background effects when confronting theoretical predictions for J/\u03c8 decays into invisible states with experimental data. This implies that invisible decays of charmonium states provide a great opportunity to search for the glimpses of BSM physics. In BSM scenarios the decay rate might be enhanced either by new heavy particles modifying the interactions of neutrinos and heavy quarks, or by opening new decay channels into light DM states. It is therefore possible to use invisible decays of charmonium states to put constraints on various models of light DM, provided that DM states couple to charmed quarks [118][119][120][121]. Predictions for radiative decays with missing energy in light DM models are available in Ref. [122].",

The SD contributions to the branching fractions for D 0 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decays can be readily computed.

Assuming for neutrino masses that m \u03bd \u223c i m \u03bd i < 0.62 eV [124], where m \u03bd i is the mass of one of the neutrinos, \u221230 . (6.37) Here x \u03bd = m \u03bd /m D and \u0393 D = 1/\u03c4 D is the total width of the D 0 meson. Such tiny rates imply that decays of heavy mesons into neutrino-antineutrino final states in the SM can be safely neglected as sources of background in the searches for DM in D decays. Such helicity suppression in the final state can be overcome by adding a third particle, such as a photon, to the final state. In fact, the SM contribution to invisible width of a Dmeson is dominated by D decays into a four-neutrino final state with a branching fraction of B(D 0 \u2192 4\u03bd) = (2.96 \u00b1 0.39) \u00d7 10 \u221227 [125]. The resulting branching fractions for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03bd\u03bd are also larger than D 0 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd by orders of magnitude [40,126]. The Belle collaboration has published a limit on the branching fraction of D decays to invisible final states, setting it at 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% C.L. [127]. BESIII could improve this limit to the order of 10 \u22126 \u2192 10 \u22125 with the final charm data set. Many NP models predict much larger branching fractions of D-mesons into the light DM states than that of D \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd. This implies that the measurement of the invisible D-width provides a practically SM-background-free search for such states [40]. Searches for D decays into a meson state and missing energy can also probe light DM states [113,128].",

This is manifested by a decay amplitude that is proportional to the mass of the final state lepton. This fact makes observation of the branching fraction of D 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 a near-impossible task and complicates the study of lepton flavor universality in charm transitions. An interesting alternative to studies of D decays is to measure the corresponding production process e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * , as shown in Fig. 6.3 [133]. This is possible if BEPCII takes data at a collision energy corresponding to the mass of the D * meson, \u221a s \u2248 2007 MeV. The production process, e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * 0 , which is inverse to the D * \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay, is rather rare, as it is driven by FCNC. Yet, the produced D * 0 resonance, tagged by a single charmed particle in the final state, will decay strongly (D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 ) or electromagnetically (D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3) with huge branching fractions of (64.7\u00b10.9)% and (35.3\u00b10.9)% respectively. This production mechanism, albeit very rare, has clear advantages for NP studies compared to the D 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay: the helicity suppression is absent, and a richer set of effective operators can be probed. It is also interesting to note that, contrary to other rare decays of charmed mesons, long-distance SM contributions are under theoretical control and contribute at the same order of magnitude as the short-distance ones [133]. Some preliminary studies of this process have been done by CMD-3 at VEPP-2000 collider in Novosibirsk [134].",

The accelerator group is strongly encouraged to implement top-up injection and to operate BEPCII close to the peak instantaneous luminosity in order to achieve overall integrated luminosity improvement, and develop effective upgrade plan to further enhance the luminosity performance and energy range. With these efforts BESIII can achieve its science goals in less time than 12 years as estimated in this White Paper. It would be reasonable to conclude that BESIII can continue for 10 years with a high quality physics program. It is important that the collaboration allocates resources to evaluate the status of the detector system, to develop upgrade plans, to optimize the data taking strategy and to maximize the physics output of the experiment.",

It is interesting to measure its cross section near threshold, whose ratio to the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c will provide insight of the vaccum productions of cc and ss pairs. In addition, it is possible to study the \u03a3 c baryon pair production at 4.91 GeV through e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 c\u03a3c . Relative to the production rate of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c , one can explore the mechanism of generating 'good' spin-0 and 'bad' spin-1 u-d diquarks inside the \u039b c and \u03a3 c , respectively, near threshold. For the charmed baryons \u039e 0 c and \u039e + c , the relative uncertainties of the measured BFs are large, and most of the decays have not yet been studied experimentally [2].

We can search for a dark photon associated with a dark Higgs h through the Higgs-strahlung e + e \u2212 \u2192 V h . Masses of both the dark Higgs and the dark photon are unknown. The dark Higgs h decay modes strongly depend on the relation between these two masses.",

The final states of the direct production could contain more lepton pairs. In this case, it is easier to extract the signals from large QED backgrounds via the reconstruction of resonances. BESIII has published two results from a light Higgs search, exploiting \u03c8(3686) [144] and J/\u03c8 [145] decays respectively. These results can also be interpreted to constrain the dark photon. They are still limited by statistics, so the sensitivity will be improved with more data.",

One of the easiest ways would be to combine all the three possible combinations of di-photon invariant mass spectrum, and then search for a narrow resonance 'a' signal.
