The search for and the observation of electroweak single top quark production by the CDF and D\u00d8 collaborations at Fermilab's Tevatron collider are an example of an elaborate effort to measure the rate of a very rare process in the presence of large backgrounds and to learn about the properties of the top quark's weak interaction. We present here the techniques used to make this groundbreaking measurement and the interpretation of the results in the context of the Standard Model.",

            "text": "The top quark is the most massive known elementary particle and is produced in very highenergy collisions of other particles. With a lifetime of only 5.2 \u00d7 10 -25 s (1), it decays nearly instantaneously into lighter particles, a W boson and a bottom quark (2). By all accounts, it appears to fit well in the Standard Model scheme as a very heavy up-type quark. Its charge is +(2/3)e (3,4), it couples via the strong interaction in the same way as other quarks (1), and it decays via the weak interaction. Despite this level of knowledge, puzzles remain within the neat classification of particles in the Standard Model. For example, three generations of fermions are known to exist, and there are no more than three flavors of light neutrinos (5). There is no known reason, however, why there should only be three generations. A fourth may exist (6), and possibly more (7), but the new particles' masses and couplings must be such that they have negligible effects on quantities measured precisely at colliders so far. One such measurement is presented in this article -the observation of electroweak production of single top quarks, which constrains a coupling constant of the weak interaction that in turn constrains the character of a fourth generation of fermions.",

In s-channel production, two jets originating from b quarks are found in the detector, while in t-channel production, the second b quark has low transverse momentum and sometimes travels along the beam direction, outside of the acceptance of the detectors. For the t-channel, the jet recoiling from the top quark is initiated by a light-flavored quark. CDF and D\u00d8 can therefore use these and other characteristics to separate these signal components from each other and from the copious background processes that mimic single top quark production. The t-channel and s-channel mechanisms are also differently sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model (30). For example, if V ts is larger than expected, it would enhance the t-channel production rate but not the s-channel rate. Alternatively, if a W\u02b9\u2032 boson exists that plays a similar role as the Standard Model W boson in s-channel production but is much heavier, it would enhance the s-channel production rate much more than that of the t-channel process.",

            "text": "The searches for single top quark events at the Tevatron are daunting, much more so than the top quark pair searches sixteen years ago. There are two reasons for this: the production cross section expected for the signal is lower, and the signature of a single top quark event is less distinct from the backgrounds than is tt production, as there is only one very massive top quark present in the event and not two. This latter feature requires the collaborations to seek most of the signal in the lepton (electron or muon) plus missing transverse energy (from the neutrino from the W decay, which escapes the experimental apparatus undetected) plus two jets final state, while tt analyses typically select events with four reconstructed jets. Background events with two jets in them are produced much more often, by approximately two orders of magnitude, than four-jet events. Add to that the fact that mostly only one identified b jet is present instead of two, which means that one of the best handles for separating the signal from the background is weaker in single top searches.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, opportunities exist in the single top quark search which can be used to our advantage. The top quark's mass is known, it has just one dominant decay mode, and the properties of B hadrons and W bosons are well measured. The kinematics of the single top quark production and the system it recoils against are known at next-to-leading order (31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36)(37)(38)(39)(40)(41)(42)(43)(44)(45)(46)(47) and beyond (26,48), and many detailed Monte Carlo programs exist to simulate it with particle kinematics that match next-to-leading-order calculations: SINGLETOP (49) based on COMPHEP (50), MADEVENT (51) based on MADGRAPH (52), ONETOP (20), ALPGEN (53), TOPREX (54), ACERMC (55), ZTOP (40), MCFM (41), MC@NLO (46), and POWHEG (56). In addition, top quarks produced singly are expected to be nearly 100% polarized along a particular axis (20), which can also be used to form discriminating variables to separate signal events from background ones. Finally, the jets in single top events are almost all from quarks, whereas many of the jets in background events are from gluons, and we use the widths of the jets to separate signal from background, since gluon jets are wider than quark ones (57). The single top quark search benefits from a detailed knowledge in advance of what the signal is expected to look like in the detector, whereas more general searches for new physics must test many hypotheses, seeking particles with fewer distinguishing features. For example, the mass of the Higgs boson is unknown, and it is a scalar particle, giving its decay products a uniform angular distribution.",

The CDF (71) and D\u00d8 (72,73) detectors are located in separate interaction regions and collect data from the collisions. A subset of the sensitive elements of the detectors is read out on every beam crossing, which occur at 396 ns intervals. Data are stored in analog and digital pipelines awaiting a trigger decision. Dedicated hardware-based trigger algorithms process the initial data and select events for further consideration at a rate of a few kHz. Once an event is selected at this level, digitization and readout take place, and a second level of trigger decision is applied, reducing the trigger rate to 800 Hz. Both collaborations then use large farms of computers to run fast versions of the offline reconstruction algorithms, the results of which are used to reduce the final trigger rate to 200 Hz and the selected events are permanently recorded. Several different kinds of trigger requirements are applied in parallel in these chains. The trigger algorithms used in CDF's main analysis require the presence of a highly energetic electron or muon. CDF's non-leptonic search (74) requires large missing transverse energy and jets. D\u00d8 uses a logical OR of almost all triggers to select its events.",

Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter deposits using a cone algorithm with an angular size !R = 0.4 for CDF or 0.5 for D\u00d8. Tracks in the tracking detectors are matched with energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeters to form electron candidates and with tracks in the muon chambers to form muon candidates. Dedicated b-tagging algorithms (71, 75) identify displaced vertices formed by tracks in the cones of reconstructed jets (illustrated in Figure 3 (a)), taking advantage of the large mass (5 GeV) and long lifetime (1.5 ps) of B hadrons. The tagging efficiency is about 50% for b jets from top quark decay. These tagging algorithms are not perfect -charm hadrons sometimes form vertices that pass the b-tagging requirements, and tracking misreconstructions and nuclear scattering also allow light-flavored jets (from up, down, and strange quarks, or gluons) to pass the b-tagging criteria. The charm-jet tag-rate is about 10% and the light-flavored jet tag-rate is about 1%. For double-tagged events, D\u00d8 uses a looser cut on its neural network algorithm to gain signal acceptance.  CDF applies a neural network flavor separator (60) to b-tagged jets to help identify charm and light-flavored jets. The reconstructed secondary vertices' kinematic parameters supply the inputs to the network. Some examples of variables are the invariant mass of the displaced vertex, the highest and second-highest impact parameter significance of any track in the displaced vertex, the decay length of the displaced vertex, and the transverse momentum of the tracks with respect to the jet axis. The neural network also takes advantage of identified electrons or muons within the jet cone. A distribution of the flavor separator neural network output is shown in Figure 3 (b).",

Therefore, before we describe the selection, we first explain our model of the signal and describe the properties of the major backgrounds. The CDF experiment uses the MADEVENT Monte Carlo event generator to simulate both the s-channel and t-channel signals. MADEVENT simulates the final-state partons; PYTHIA (76) is used to simulate the parton showering of the jets and add the underlying event. A detailed detector simulation based on GEANT (77) follows. The D\u00d8 experiment uses the SINGLETOP generator, also with PYTHIA parton showering and a GEANT detector simulation. Both MADEVENT and SINGLETOP are tree-level matrix-element generators, and the t-channel modeling in particular requires generation of 2\u21922 events using the 5-flavor diagram and the 2\u21923 gluon-initiated diagram of Figure 2 (a). Events from both samples are used, based on the momentum of the recoiling b antiquark (51). The switchover point is chosen so that the kinematic distributions from the combined leading-order Monte Carlo samples match as closely as possible those from next-to-leading-order calculations (40). The kinematics of the s-channel prediction are similar at leading order and next-to-leading order (40) and no adjustment is required. The parton-level kinematics of t-channel single top production are shown in Figure 4.",

(a) shows the transverse momentum and (b) shows the pseudorapidity times electron or muon charge. We select events with a high-momentum electron or muon plus large missing transverse energy in order to obtain a sample with leptonic W boson decays, rejecting nearly all of the multijet events. The remaining multijet events have both misidentified leptons and mismeasured missing transverse energy. In s-channel signal events, the top quark decays to Wb and recoils against a b . We therefore expect two b jets in these events. In t-channel events, the top quark recoils against a light-flavored quark. Jets may fail to be reconstructed if they have too little energy, or travel too close to the beamline. Most of the expected signal events have two or three quarks from the hard scatter, plus possibly one or more radiated gluons. We therefore require events to have two, three, or four jets, and split our data into categories based on the jet counts, since the backgrounds vary from one jet category to another. CDF and D\u00d8 apply the selection requirements shown in Table 1 to reduce the dataset from over a billion events to a few thousand. The cuts for 2-jet events are shown; those for 3-jets and 4-jets are similar but with slightly higher missing transverse energy and total transverse energy requirements to reject the higher multijet background. After all selections, CDF keeps 1.8% of s-channel events and 1.2% of t-channel events. D\u00d8 has looser cuts and keeps 3.7% of s-channel events and 2.5% of t-channel events. The t-channel acceptance is lower than for the s-channel for both experiments because the t-channel's b jet produced with the top quark usually has very low transverse momentum and travels near to the beamline, and so is often not reconstructed.",

We separate events into categories that have one b-tagged jet and two b-tagged jets, as t-channel signal events are expected to have predominantly one b-tagged jet and s-channel signal events have two b jets, one or both of which may be b tagged. The tt background forms a larger fraction of the double-tagged sample, and the W + light flavor contribution is substantially reduced in the double-tagged sample as both jets must be mistakenly tagged, which happens less than 0.02% of the time.

They affect the normalization and are in descending order: a correction factor on the ratio of Wbb to Wcc ; primary vertex selection; Monte Carlo statistics; jet fragmentation modeling (we compare results using PYTHIA for creating jets with those from HERWIG (79)); the W boson branching fractions; the Z+jets heavy flavor correction; jet reconstruction and identification; the instantaneous luminosity correction; the parton distributions functions (CDF uses CTEQ65L (80), D\u00d8 uses CTEQ6M (81)); the Z+jets theory cross sections; normalization of the W+jets and multijets rates using data; and the diboson theory cross sections. All have a small effect on the outcome. Finally, there are sources of uncertainty that affect only the shapes of the distributions, not the normalizations. These are correction functions for the jet pseudorapidity and dijet angle distributions in W+jets events in the ALPGEN event generator, the factorization and renormalization scale choices in ALPGEN, the flavor composition of the non-W events, and the trigger turn-on curve correction functions for Monte Carlo events. All systematic uncertainties are propagated through the analysis techniques to the final results, as shown in Figure 8.",

However, since our average signal-to-background ratio across all analysis channels is about 1:20, which is smaller than the a priori fractional uncertainty on the background rate, this is not possible. Multivariate discriminants need to be applied to separate signal from background before likelihood calculations can be used on the resulting output distributions. This need was anticipated from the start of the analyses, since loose selection cuts were chosen to maximize the signal acceptance, and the analysts knew many background events would also be selected. If tighter selections had been made to maximize instead the signal-to-background ratio, then there would not be enough signal acceptance to make a significant signal observation until many times more data had been collected.",

The events populate a very high-dimensional space of useful variables. Advanced analysis techniques, described in a review in this volume (82), are used to reduce the dimensionality to a single output variable per selection channel, typically demarcated by the number of reconstructed jets (two, three, or four), the number of b tags (one or two), and for CDF whether the event was collected by the lepton trigger or the missing-E T plus jets trigger, or for D\u00d8 the lepton flavor (electron or muon) and run period (before the silicon tracker (83) upgrade or after it (84)).",

One approach is to identify variables with different distributions for the signal and background, and combine them with likelihood functions (60), neural networks (D\u00d8 has used MLPFIT (85) in the past and CDF uses NEUROBAYES (86)), or decision trees (87). These techniques rely on the background model accurately reproducing the data in every variable used. The decision trees and D\u00d8's neural networks undergo a further sophisticated step in their use in which a large number of iterations of the tree or network are averaged using boosting (88) or a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique (89) implemented in the FBM software package (90) to improve the separation and stability of the result. D\u00d8 uses the RULEFIT package (91) to rank and then select the variables with the best separation power for the Bayesian neural networks. Boosted decision trees can use an almost unlimited number of variables, as they ignore those that are not useful. The second approach is the matrix element method (92), in which the probabilities for all possible interpretations of every event are calculated.",

            "text": "The variables used as inputs to the first class of discriminators fall into six different categories. The first set is of object kinematics, that is, the transverse momenta and angular properties of each individual object (jet, lepton, or missing transverse energy representing the neutrino) in the event. The second set is of event kinematics, where momentum and energy properties of two or more objects are combined. These variables provide information about the particles (like a W or Z boson or a gluon) that produced the final state objects. An example variable in this category is shown in Figures 9 (a) and (b). The third set, used by D\u00d8, contains jet reconstruction properties such as the widths (57) and masses of the jets and the momentum of a muon from a b jet relative to the jet axis. The fourth set of variables is a special case of event kinematics, where a top quark is reconstructed using each jet in the event in turn to determine its properties. The fifth set of variables consists of angular correlations (93)(94)(95), that is, the angles between each combination of objects in the event. An example of this type of variable is shown in Figures 9 (c) and (d). The sixth set, used by CDF, is the jet flavor separator applied to each jet in the event (see Figure 3). Each variable is considered after a comparison of background model with data in all analysis channels is found to be within uncertainties, and then is chosen if it shows a different enough distribution between at least one of the signals (s-channel or t-channel) and at least one of the backgrounds ( tt ! dileptons , tt ! lepton+jets , Wbb , Wcc , Wcj, Wjj, Z+jets, dibosons, multijets). Table 3 shows a selection of the variables with the best separation power between signals and W+jets and between signals and tt pairs. Both CDF and D\u00d8 analyze their data samples using multiple advanced discrimination techniques. Analysis team members participate in this process both by processing the data and evaluating the signal and background expectations and uncertainties, and also by contributing an advanced analysis technique. In order to preserve the work of all contributors while simultaneously further optimizing the sensitivity of the total analysis, the discriminant outputs are combined to produce super-discriminants. This step improves the sensitivity of the analyses",

D\u00d8's networks are optimized in a more traditional manner using an error function, which measures the signal-background similarity.

The highbackground bins constrain the systematic uncertainties in situ.

The single top quark cross sections are measured using a Bayesian calculation (98) combining the data, the signal acceptance, and the background estimate, with all uncertainties, in every bin of the output distributions of the discriminants in each analysis channel. Thousands of measurements are combined into posterior probability densities from which we get the final cross section results. A uniform non-negative prior for the cross section is assumed. The s-channel+t-channel cross section measurements and the expected and observed significances for each analysis technique are summarized in Table 4 for CDF and D\u00d8. The two collaborations have also exchanged the histograms of their data and the corresponding signal and background predictions, with all systematic uncertainties, as well as the programs required to compute the cross sections. A joint posterior was formed, allowing the total cross section to be measured combining the CDF and D\u00d8 measurements (99) in the same way that the separate measurements within the collaborations are combined. This measurement is also listed in Table 4. D\u00d8 has estimated the components of its total cross section uncertainty of 22% that come from data statistics and from the combined systematic uncertainties: they are 18% from data statistics and 13% from systematics. The cross section measurements are therefore just moving from being statistics-limited towards being limited in their precision by the knowledge and control of the systematic uncertainties. V tb Measurement. The total single top quark production cross section is proportional to V tb 2 , neglecting components that are proportional to V ts 2 and V td 2 since they are expected to be very much smaller. If the 3\u00d73 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is unitary, then V tb is nearly unity, but if the CKM matrix is either larger, owing to the presence of a fourth generation of quarks or more, or if it is not unitary for other reasons, then V tb can be smaller (30,100,101). We use the same technique as we used for the measured cross section to form a posterior density in V tb measured 2 , although in this case we also include the uncertainty on ! s+t theory . Two posteriors are formed: one is chosen only to be non-negative, V tb 2 ! 0 , while the other is further constrained to lie within the physical region 0 ! V tb 2 ! 1 . The first choice is used to obtain a measurement of V tb that can be averaged with other measurements in an unbiased way, while the second one is used to find a physically allowed range. The combined results (99) from CDF and D\u00d8 assuming ! s+t theory = 3.46 pb and V tb theory = 0.999 , are V tb measured = 0.88 \u00b1 0.07 , and 0.77 < V tb measured ! 1 at the 95% confidence level.",

A uniform prior is assumed in the (! s ,! t ) plane, allowing only for non-negative cross section measurements. Independent information for these two cross sections comes largely from the separation of the data into single-b-tagged and double-b-tagged subsets, although the kinematic differences between the two signals contribute even within the analysis channels. The two-dimensional results are shown in Figure 14 The theory values for comparison are ! t = 2.34 \u00b1 0.12 pb and ! s = 1.12 \u00b1 0.04 pb (26). CDF's result is not in good agreement with the SM prediction; the disagreement is visible as a deficit of data with respect to the signal plus background prediction in the single-b-tagged channels and an excess of data in the double-b-tagged channels (60). D\u00d8's t-channel measurement is one standard deviation higher than the theory and has a significance of 4.8 standard deviations, almost at the observation level, and the s-channel result is very close to the theory prediction.",

The final state therefore has no electron or muon in it, just missing transverse energy and jets. A new more efficient algorithm for hadronic \u03c4 identification in events with other jets has been developed for this analysis. Although a signal is not observed, the new upper limit on single top production of 7.3 pb at 95% confidence level is combined with the observation result to get an improved cross section measurement: Anomalous Couplings. Although single top is not very sensitive to anomalies in the strong gtt coupling (113), it is the process that is the most sensitive to the electroweak Wtb coupling (21,(114)(115)(116)(117)(118). One can also search for flavor-changing neutral-current couplings tgu and tgc (119)(120)(121)(122)(123)(124)(125). Previously, D\u00d8 published two results looking for anomalous Wtb couplings in single top quark production (126,127). The second result combines the single top measurement with the W helicity one from top decay in tt pairs (128). Nothing anomalous is observed, and limits are set on all combinations of pairs of couplings, left-handed or right-handed, vector or tensor.",

It started long-term operation in March 2010 and collected ~40 pb -1 of data until switching to heavy ion collisions in November 2010. It will restart proton collisions in early 2011, possibly at a slightly higher energy. The design calls for collisions at 14 TeV, which will occur after a long shutdown, restarting in 2013 or 2014. The first studies for single top quark physics at the LHC have been performed using simulations of 14 TeV collisions, see e.g. reference (136) by the ATLAS collaboration or (137) by the CMS collaboration. The theory cross sections at 14 TeV are: t-channel, 150 pb for top quarks and 92 pb for top antiquarks; tW production, 50 pb for top quarks and 50 pb for top antiquarks; and for s-channel, 8 pb for top quarks and 4 pb for top antiquarks (138). The rates for top and antitop are different in the t-channel because top is produced from a valence quark in the proton together with a gluon, whereas antitop is produced from a sea quark and a gluon. In the s-channel, the asymmetry comes about because a quark and an antiquark are needed from the protons, and a proton has two up valence quarks (charge +(2/3)e) and one down valence quark (charge -(1/3)e), with sea quarks coming in roughly equal quantities, so ud ! tb is more likely than ud ! tb . The tW process starts from a gb initial state, with the b coming from g ! bb , so top and antitop production are equally likely. Once operation of the LHC at 14 TeV starts, there will be very large samples of single top quark events and high precision measurements of the cross sections, V tb , the top quark width and lifetime, and searches beyond the Standard Model will be performed.",

With the very small datasets currently available, searches for single top quark production have not yet been made public.

The background models use leading-order theory cross sections for normalization, and so are somewhat underestimated. Various tighter selections are then applied to improve the sensitivity, which is expected to give a cross section uncertainty of about 40% (141). Two new studies address single top quark selection and polarization measurements at the LHC, using next-to-leading order modeling (142,143).

In 2009, the CDF and D\u00d8 collaborations simultaneously announced observation of single top quark production (58)(59)(60). Approximately 15 years elapsed between the start of the search and its completion because the signal is small and the process looks similar to the very large backgrounds. Not only did enough data have to be collected, but the tools used to model the backgrounds and to identify the final state objects in the events had to be significantly improved in this period. Pioneering work has been performed in the use of multivariate discriminants to separate signal from background, and the single top quark physics programs are at the leading edge in sophistication in the development and application of experimental techniques in highenergy physics today.",

It is important to understand the weak interactions of the top quark, exemplified by weak production of single top quarks, in order to be able to check for new physics beyond the Standard Model. 4. New techniques had to be developed and applied in order to separate the tiny signal from huge backgrounds of similar events.

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN will collect enough data for single top quark production to be observed in a couple of years' time in the t-channel and tW production modes. The lowrate s-channel mode will need much more data to be separated from background. 4. Other processes not yet studied at the Tevatron, which will become accessible at the Large Hadron Collider include single top quark production via Kaluza-Klein excitations in models with large extra dimensions, technipions, R-parity-violating supersymmetric squarks or sleptons, littlest Higgs models with T-parity, and CP-violation as seen in the bottom and kaon sectors. 5. Single top quarks are also predicted to be produced together with a neutral Standard Model Higgs boson, with a charged Higgs boson from supersymmetric models, with a charged heavy pion, with a heavy neutral scalar particle, or with a charmed quark via flavor-changing neutral-current interactions.

The Higgs boson is more difficult to find than single top because the predicted cross section is much smaller, the mass is not yet known, and the decay products are isotropically distributed in its rest frame, whereas there is more kinematic structure in the top quark decay. Recent examples of Higgs boson searches use 2.7 fb -1 of data by the CDF collaboration (144) and 5.3 fb -1 by the D\u00d8 collaboration (145), where an upper limit of 4.5 times the predicted rate for a Higgs boson of mass 115 GeV at 95% confidence level has been set.
