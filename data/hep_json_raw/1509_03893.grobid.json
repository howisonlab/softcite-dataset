The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L = 12.6 \u00b1 0.4 nb \u22121 , has been collected with an unbiased trigger for inclusive particle production. The cross section is obtained from the measured number of proton-lead collisions with hadronic activity produced in the pseudorapidity ranges 3 < \u03b7 < 5 and/or \u22125 < \u03b7 < \u22123, corrected for photon-induced contributions, experimental acceptance, and other instrumental effects. The inelastic cross section is measured to be \u03c3 inel (pPb) = 2061 \u00b1 3(stat) \u00b1 34(syst) \u00b1 72(lumi) mb. Various Monte Carlo generators, commonly used in heavy ion and cosmic ray physics, are found to reproduce the data within uncertainties. The value of \u03c3 inel (pPb) is compatible with that expected from the proton-proton cross section at 5.02 TeV scaled up within a simple Glauber approach to account for multiple scatterings in the lead nucleus, indicating that further net nuclear corrections are small.",

            "text": "While being one of the most inclusive observables in hadronic collisions, the inelastic cross section is one of the least theoretically accessible quantities, as it cannot be determined from first-principles calculations of the theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics. In proton-proton (pp) and nucleusnucleus collisions at the LHC, particles produced in hadronic interactions come mostly from the hadronisation of quarks and gluons, either produced in semi-hard scatterings (\"minijets\") [4] or emitted at very forward rapidities from \"spectator\" partons, as well as from soft diffractive processes in \"peripheral\" interactions. From E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. the measured inelastic proton-proton (or nucleon-nucleon) cross section at a given collision energy, one can theoretically derive the corresponding proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus cross sections by means of Glauber [5,6] or Gribov-Regge [7] multiple-scattering approaches that take into account the known transverse matter profile of nuclei. Key quantities for the experimental comparison between nucleus-nucleus and pp collisions-such as the nuclear overlap function, the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions and of participant nucleons [8,9]-are also commonly computed through such approaches. Validating the Glauber and Gribov-Regge predictions with proton-nucleus collisions at LHC energies has important implications beyond collider physics. Such approaches constitute crucial ingredients in the Monte Carlo modelling of cosmic ray air showers at the highest energies [10], for which the inelastic cross sections measured in the laboratory must be extrapolated over a wide energy range. In fact, the inelastic proton-air (mostly protonnitrogen and proton-oxygen) cross section introduces one of the largest uncertainties for air shower simulations [11,12].",

            "text": "The Glauber multiple-collision model, based on the eikonal limit (i.e. straight-line trajectories of the colliding nucleons), is the simplest and most economical approach often used to derive inclusive proton-nucleus quantities from the pp cross sections and, vice versa, to obtain pp cross sections from the cosmic ray measurements [13]. However, some of the approximations applied in the model-foremost the absence of short-range nucleon correlations [14] and of inelastic screening [15] cross section values. This is observed for fixed-target protoncarbon data [16][17][18][19][20] and estimated for collider [21,22] as well as ultra-high cosmic ray [13] energies, where corrections to the proton-air cross section of the order of 10% have been obtained. Short-range correlations increase the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions at small impact parameters yielding a larger nucleusnucleus cross section. On the other hand, screening affects the number of nucleons that are diffractively excited in the multiple collisions but revert back to their ground state before the scattering process is completed, thereby reducing the nuclear cross section. Different implementations of such effects exist in the current hadronic interaction models [15,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29]. A measurement of \u03c3 inel in pPb collisions at the LHC can test if the precision of the standard Glauber calculation is sufficient, and at which energies corrections to the Glauber approach may become relevant.",

The events are collected using an unbiased trigger, only requiring the presence of both beams in the interaction point, as determined by the \"Beam Pickup Timing for the eXperiments\" (BPTX) devices. Detector noise is studied with events that are randomly read out in the absence of both beams in the detector. The luminosity determination technique was calibrated by means of a van der Meer scan [31] for both beam directions independently, with an uncertainty of 3.5% [32]. A Monte Carlo event simulation based on a Geant4 detector description [33] is used to model the experimental response and derive the reconstruction efficiencies. Different event generators are used to simulate hadronic proton-nucleus collisions. Three models are based on the Gribov-Regge formalism: dpmjet 3.06 [34], epos-lhc [25], and qgsjetii-04 [26]; and a fourth one is based on a minijet+Glauber approach: hijing 1.383 [35]. In addition, particle production from photon-proton (\u03b3 p) interactions in \"ultraperipheral\" collisions, at impact parameters larger than the sum of proton and lead radii, needs to be taken into account [36]. Given the large Pb ion charge, and the associated large \"equivalent photon flux\" of its electromagnetic field [36], inelastic photon-proton collisions result in a non-negligible particle production contribution. Pure photon-photon interactions, mostly producing exclusive electron-positron pairs, and photon-nucleus interactions (where the photon emitted from the proton collides with the Pb ion) have orders-of-magnitude smaller visible cross sections and are neglected. Photon-proton processes are generated with the starlight programme [37] combined either with dpmjet 3.05 or pythia 6.4.26 [38].",

As a further check of the HF tower energy resolution, the cross sections are computed by increasing the selection thresholds to E HF > 10 GeV (5 GeV). To account for both effects, a systematic uncertainty on the cross section of 0.6% (0.4%) is added. The cross sections measured for the two beam directions are found to be consistent. Consequently, no dedicated systematic uncertainty is assigned to this effect. All the different sources of uncertainty of the measurement are listed in Table 2 for the single-arm and double-arm event selections. The three derived cross sections have different systematic uncertainties since not all contributions are relevant to each of them. For \u03c3 inel , all uncertainties but the one due to the hadronlevel correction contribute. The total uncorrelated systematic uncertainty is therefore 2.5% (2.2%) for the single-arm (double-arm) selection.

The Glauber calculation yields 2130 \u00b1 40 mb and is compatible with the measurement presented here indicating that effects neglected by the calculation (such as nucleon correlations and screening) are either small or approximately cancel out. The experimental result is also consistent with the prediction of the dipsy model [44,45] based on a dipole-model approach including parton saturation and multiple-scattering. Among the Gribov-Regge models, the epos prediction is compatible with the measurement within uncertainties, whereas dpmjet and qgsjetii predict a value more than 1 standard deviation above the data, with a larger discrepancy appearing for the \u03c3 vis cross sections (Table 3). The epos and qgsjetii models are commonly used for cosmic ray air shower simulations. Thus, at the corresponding cosmic ray proton energies of E cr = s/(2m p ) = 10 16.1 eV,",
