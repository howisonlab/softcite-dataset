Over the years, several theoretical models have been developed to explain this discrepancy [4][5][6][7]. In order to check the consistency of the models, a measurement of the F \u03c6\u03c0 0 (q 2 ) TFF, which has never been measured so far, was strongly recommended. In particular, because of its kinematics, the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 process is a very good benchmark to investigate the observed steep rise in NA60 data at q 2 close to the \u03c1 resonance mass.",

The MC simulation of the signal has been produced according to Eq. 1, assuming a point-like TFF (i.e. |F \u03c6 \u03c0 0 (q 2 )| 2 = 1). The radiative emission from the leptons in the final state of the channel under study is also included in the simulation by means of the PHOTOS MC generator [17].

The dominant contributions to background events originate from double radiative Bhabha scattering (e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 ) and from the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decay, where the \u03b3 converts to a e + e \u2212 pair in the interaction with the beam pipe or drift chamber walls.

The constraints on angular and energy variables have been obtained looking at the differences between the signal and used to remove residual background events with muons or charged pions in the final state. When an energy cluster is associated to a track, the ToF to the calorimeter is evaluated using both the calorimeter timing (t clu ) and the time along the track trajectory, namely t trk = L trk /\u03b2c, where L trk is the length of the track path. The difference t = t trk \u2212 t clu is then evaluated in the electron hypothesis; all events with t < 0.8 ns are retained for further analysis. This algorithm, together with the cut on the energies of the final particles, turns out to be crucial for reducing the contamination from the decay \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 to a negligible level. After all the above described cuts the overall efficiency, as estimated by the MC, is 15.4%. The efficiency is 19.5% at lower e + e \u2212 invariant masses, decreasing to a few percent at the highest values of momentum transfer. For this reason the analysis is limited up to q 2 = 700 MeV.

            "text": "The agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation, after all selection cuts, is shown in Fig. 1   In order to subtract the residual background from data, the e + e \u2212 invariant-mass spectrum is divided into 15 bins of increasing width (to preserve the statistics of signal candidates). In each bin of q 2 , the m miss e + e \u2212 distribution is fit by a sum of two Gaussian functions, parametrizing the signal, and a third-order polynomial, parametrizing the background. Some examples of the fits to the m miss e + e \u2212 distributions are shown in Fig. 3. Apart from a global normalization, the parameters of the Gaussian functions are fixed by a fit of the MC signal distribution. The background contribution is evaluated bin by bin, without any assumption or constraint for the polynomial parameters. Once the residual background is parametrized, it is bin by bin subtracted from data. The modulus square of the TFF, |F \u03c6\u03c0 0 (q 2 )| 2 , is a factor in front of the q 2 differential cross section (see Eq. (2)), hence it can be extracted from data by dividing the measured e + e \u2212 invariant-mass spectrum by the spectrum of reconstructed MC signal events, generated with a constant F \u03c6 \u03c0 0 (q 2 ), after all the analysis cuts. The result is reported in Table 1. The measured TFF is normalized so that |F \u03c6 \u03c0 0 (q 2 )| 2 = 1 in the first bin. The errors include both the statistical and the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty consists of two major contributions: the first due to the experimental resolution of the variables to which the analysis cuts are applied, and the second associated to the background fitting procedure.",

The data are in agreement with the theoretical prediction based on the Unconstrained Resonant Chiral Theory (UChT), with parameters extracted from a fit of the NA60 data. From the same data set we obtained a value of BR (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ; q 2 < 700 MeV) = (1.19 \u00b1 0.05 +0.05 \u22120.10 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . An extrapolation based on the theoretical model in agreement with the data has been used to extend the result to the full q 2 range. The value obtained is BR (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 ) = (1.35 \u00b1 0.05 +0.05 \u22120.10 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , that improves significantly the results obtained by SND and CMD-2 experiments, and is in agreement with theoretical predictions.",

Each cell is read out at both ends by photomultipliers, both in amplitude and time. The energy deposits are obtained from the signal amplitude while the arrival times and the particle positions are obtained from the time of the signals collected at the two ends. Cells close in time and space are grouped into energy clusters. Energy and time resolutions are \u03c3 E /E = 5.7%/ \u221a E (GeV) and \u03c3 t = 57 ps/ \u221a E (GeV) \u2295 100 ps, respectively. The trigger [14] uses both calorimeter and chamber information. In this analysis the events are selected by the calorimeter trigger, requiring two energy deposits with E > 50 MeV for the barrel and E > 150 MeV for the endcaps. Large angle Bhabha scattering events are used to obtain luminosity, center-of-mass energy and crossing angle of the beams. A precision measurement of \u221a s, with negligible statistical uncertainty and a systematic error of \u223c 30 keV, is routinely performed on the basis of 200 nb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The systematic error is in fact on the absolute momentum scale, derived from the analysis of the \u03c6 lineshape",

The \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 contamination, with the \u03b3 converting on the BP or DC walls, is suppressed by tracing back the tracks of the e + /e \u2212 candidates, by reconstructing the invariant mass (m BP,DC e + e \u2212 ) and the distance (d BP,DC e + e \u2212 ) of the track pair both at the BP and DC wall surfaces. Both variables are expected to be small for photon conversion events, so that this background is suppressed by rejecting events with: m BP e + e \u2212 < 10 MeV and d BP e + e \u2212 < 2 cm, or m DC e + e \u2212 < 80 MeV and d DC e + e \u2212 < 3 cm.
