The likelihood analysis of the combined data sample, which corresponds to a total of 1:8 \u00c2 10 14 muon decays, gives a 90% C.L. upper limit of 2:4 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 on the branching ratio of the \u00fe ! e \u00fe decay, constituting the most stringent limit on the existence of this decay to date.",

Even with the introduction of neutrino masses and mixing SM predicts an immeasurably small branching ratio (B & 10 \u00c051 ) for this decay. Conversely, new physics scenarios beyond SM, such as supersymmetric grand unified theories or theories with extra dimensions, predict branching ratios in the 10 \u00c012 to 10 \u00c014 range [1][2][3]. This is close to the present limit set by the MEGA experiment [4], B 1:2 \u00c2 10 \u00c011 , which places one of the most stringent constraints on the formulation of such theories. Observation of ! e therefore would be an unambiguous signature of new physics, while improvements on the existing limit would stringently constrain many of the new physics scenarios beyond the SM.",

A 9 MeV line from the capture in nickel of neutrons from a pulsed and triggerable deuteron-deuteron neutron generator allows one to check the stability of the LXe detector even during data taking. The relative time between the TC and LXe detector is monitored using RMD and 2 events from 11 5 B\u00f0p; 2\u00de 12 6 C reactions. The \u00fe ! e \u00fe trigger requires the presence of a high energy ray in the LXe detector and a hit on the timing counters within a 20 ns window together with an approximate back-to-back topology. Prescaled monitoring and calibration triggers are also recorded. A more detailed description of the MEG detector can be found in Ref. [6].",

In order to convert N sig into a branching ratio value the normalization relative to the Michel decay is computed [6] by counting the number of Michel positrons passing the same analysis cuts. This is accomplished by means of a prescaled Michel positron trigger enabled during the physics data taking. A correction to the prescaling factor due to positron pileup in the TC is taken into account. Another method for computing the normalization uses RMD events in the E sideband and the theoretical branching ratio of the RMD. The normalizations calculated by these two independent methods are in good agreement and are combined to give the normalization factor with a 7% uncertainty.",
