RHIC has produced many exiting physics results in recent years. The latest data from RHIC significantly constrain the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin, and the parity violating single spin asymmetry are observed for the first time in W production by both the PHENIX and STAR collaborations. In this report, I present the latest results from the PHENIX and STAR experiments, followed by a brief discussion of the future prospects of transverse physics, particularly on the importance of the unique measurements of Drell-Yan single spin asymmetry.",

            "text": "Spin plays a key role in the determination of the properties of fundamental particles and their interactions. However, two outstanding spin puzzles have challenged our understanding of QCD over 30 years: (1) the challenge of \"too small\", i.e., the nucleon spin puzzle. It was believed that the spin of proton was carried mostly by the quarks that make up the proton. However, experiments in the 1980's led to the startling discovery that quark-spin contribute very little to the proton spin, setting off the \"proton spin crisis\". Where the rest of the proton spin coming from remains a major challenge to our understanding of the nucleon structure. Currently, there are several candidates that could make up the difference, the gluons' spin and quark and gluon's orbital angular momentum. Their contributions need to be determined by experimental measurements; (2) the challenge of \"too big\", i.e., the unexpectedly large left-right transverse single spin asymmetries (TSSA, A N ) in transversely polarized high-energy \u20ac p \u2191 + p (and \u20ac l + p \u2191 ) collisions. Prior to the early Fermilab E704 experimental measurements, it was believed based on collinear pQCD arguments that transverse single spin asymmetry should be very small in high-energy p+p collisions, \u20ac A N~m q p T~O (10 \u22124 ) , while the experimental data showed asymmetry order of 10%. Such large TSSAs are also observed at RHIC energies. Spin measurements have historically produced surprising results and are a stringent test to theories as spin is an intrinsically relativistic and quantum mechanical aspect of particle interactions.",

This value has been used to determine the polarized background contribution \u00fe\u00f0\u00c0\u00de \u00bc \u00c00:002 AE 0:001\u00f0\u00c00:005 AE 0:002\u00de. The unpolarized background correction for W AE candidate events is \u00fe\u00f0\u00c0\u00de \u00bc 0:938 AE 0:017\u00f00:838 AE 0:032\u00de. This dilution factor is due to background events passing all W selection cuts and is determined by \u00bc S=\u00f0S \u00fe B\u00de, where S (B) is the number of signal (background) events for 25 < E e T < 50 GeV. The relative luminosities R i \u00bc P k M k =\u00f04M i \u00de are determined from the ratios of yields M i of QCD events, for which parity conservation is expected. The M i are statistically independent from N W AE i because the isolation cut on the 2 \u00c2 2=4 \u00c2 4 tower E T sum, shown in Fig. 1, was reversed for those events. Additionally, an upper limit of 20 GeV was set on E e T . Figure 4 shows the measured leptonic asymmetries A W \u00fe L \u00bc \u00c00:27 AE 0:10\u00f0stat:\u00de AE 0:02\u00f0syst:\u00de and A W \u00c0 L \u00bc 0:14 AE 0:19\u00f0stat:\u00de AE 0:02\u00f0syst:\u00de for j e j < 1 and 25 < E e T < 50 GeV. The vertical black error bars include only the statistical uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are indicated as grey bands. The statistical uncertainties dominate over the systematic uncertainties. The asymmetry A L observed in statistically independent samples of QCD dominated events was found to be 0:04 AE 0:03 (0:00 AE 0:04) for positive (negative) charged tracks and is consistent with zero. We assumed the experimental limit on the polarized background A L to be 0.02 as a systematic uncertainty of A W AE L . This limit on polarized background and the uncertainty in unpolarized background dilution have been added in quadrature to account for the total systematic uncertainty of A W AE L . The normalization uncertainty of the measured asymmetries due to the uncertainty for the polarization sum P 1 \u00fe P 2 is 0.03 (0.01) for A W \u00fe\u00f0\u00c0\u00de",

With upcoming detector upgrades for both the PHENIX and STAR experiments and expected much improved accelerator performance, RHIC-Spin program will provide a great opportunity for new studies of polarized nucleon structure and the QCD dynamics. The future Drell-Yan A N measurement is particularly important at RHIC [6] . There is a fundamental prediction of QCD that A N of Drell-Yan should have an opposite sign compared to the A N (\u03c0 + ) observed in the polarized DIS experiments, see Figure 4. Its verification or disproval will be an important milestone in our understanding of QCD. Left: Charged pion Sivers asymmetries measured by the HERMES experiment.
