            "text": "The study of hyperon production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) is important for a better understanding of the role of strange quarks in the nucleon structure and in the hadronization process. The lightest hyperon, the \u039b baryon, was studied in most detail. In addition to \u039b from direct production, a significant fraction of \u039b particles originates from the decay of heavier hyperons such as \u03a3 0 , \u03a3 * , or \u039e . The notation for \u03a3(1385) and \u039e(1321) will be used without indicating mass values, and with the \"*\" symbol for \u03a3 (1385) in order to distinguish the J P = 3/2 + \u03a3 hyperons from the J P = 1/2 + ones. An indirect \u039b production from hyperons decays is also included in the measurements of the longitudinal spin transfer to the \u039b hyperon in polarised DIS [1,2]. Using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the Lund string fragmentation model [3], the authors of Ref. [1] have estimated that only about 40 % of the produced \u039b baryons originate from direct string fragmentation.",

DIS events are selected by cuts on the four-momentum squared of the virtual photon, Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 , and on the fractional energy y of the virtual photon, 0.2 < y < 0.9. The latter cut removes events with large radiative corrections at large y and with poorly reconstructed kinematic variables at low y. The resulting data sample consists of 3.12 \u00d7 10 8 events. The \u039b and\u039b hyperons are identified by their decays into p\u03c0 \u2212 andp\u03c0 + , respectively. In order to evaluate possible systematic effects, decays of K 0 s into \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + were also analysed. The K 0 s background was already disscused in details in Ref. [2]. Candidate events for \u039b,\u039b and K 0 s were selected by requiring that two hadron tracks form a secondary vertex located within a 105 cm long fiducial region starting 5 cm downstream of the target. Outside this region, decay-hadron tracks cannot be reconstructed with sufficient resolution. Vertices with identified muons or electrons were removed. Only hadrons with momenta larger than 1 GeV/c were retained, guaranteeing a good reconstruction efficiency. A further cut was imposed on the transverse momentum p T of the decay products with respect to the hyperon direction, p T > 23 MeV/c, in order to reject e + e \u2212 pairs from \u03b3 -conversion. Using the Feynman variable x F , the \u039b(\u039b) candidates were selected in the current fragmentation region requiring x F > 0.05.",

The corresponding values for the relative yields of \u039e \u2212 and\u039e + are equal to 0.001. (b) The systematic uncertainties coming from the evaluation of the background were estimated using a mixed event method. In this method, the shape of the background in the \u039b\u03c0 invariant-mass distribution was determined by combining lambdas and pions from different events. The energies of these pions were chosen to be similar to the energy of the pion from the \u039b decay. The standard collinearity cut (\u03b8 col ) was also applied.

We note that COMPASS has collected considerably larger (from 30 to 130 times) samples of hyperons than NOMAD in the current fragmentation region. It is interesting to compare the charged lepton and the neutrino data despite the different underlying interactions. COMPASS measures similar values for the \u03a3 * + /\u039b and \u03a3 * \u2212 /\u039b ratios. Taking into account experimental uncertainties, the same conclusion is valid for NOMAD data but with NOMAD values being a factor of two smaller than the COMPASS ones. Finally, within uncertainties, the \u039e \u2212 /\u039b yield ratio measured by NOMAD is consistent with zero, while COMPASS gives comparable and non-zero values for \u039e \u2212 /\u039b and\u039e + /\u039b ratios.

These parameters characterize the properties of the LEPTO generator not associated with kinematic distributions of hyperons: PARJ(1)-suppression of diquark-  antidiquark pair production in the colour field; PARJ(2)suppression of ss-pair production compared to u\u016b-or ddpair production; PARJ(3)-extra suppression of strange diquark production compared to the normal suppression of strange quarks; PARJ(4)-suppression of spin-1 diquarks compared to spin-0 ones; PARJ(5)-relative occurrence of baryon-antibaryon production; PARJ(7)-strange meson suppression factor. A study of the MC distributions of the common SIDIS Q 2 and W and the baryon variables z and p T for \u039b, \u03a3 * , \u039e and their antiparticles was performed. The distributions of two MC data sets, with default and tuned parameters, were found to be consistent within errors. The Q 2 , W , z and p T ratios of real data and Monte Carlo samples with both tuned and default parameters are similar without strong deviations from unity.",

All yield ratios were found to be in the range 3.8 % to 5.6 %. Within the relative uncertainties of about 10 %, the yield ratios for hyperons and antihyperons are quite similar. No strong Q 2 dependence of the ratios was found within the statistical accuracy. The obtained results imply that some parameters of the LEPTO code, which are associated with strange quark production and fragmentation in charged lepton DIS processes, should be substantially modified. Using the tuned LEPTO parameters, the fractions of indirectly produced \u039b and\u039b hyperons were found to be 37 % and 32 %, respectively.",
