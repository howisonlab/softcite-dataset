Cross-section measurements are performed as a function of the transverse momentum p T and the rapidity y of the J/\u03c8 meson in the region p T < 14 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5, for both prompt J/\u03c8 mesons and J/\u03c8 mesons from b-hadron decays. The production cross-sections integrated over the kinematic coverage are 15.30 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.86 \u00b5b for prompt J/\u03c8 and 2.34 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5b for J/\u03c8 from b-hadron decays, assuming zero polarization of the J/\u03c8 meson. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The cross-section reported for J/\u03c8 mesons from b-hadron decays is used to extrapolate to a total bb cross-section. The ratios of the cross-sections with respect to \u221a s = 8 TeV are also determined.",

            "text": "The study of heavy quarkonium production in pp collisions provides important information on both the perturbative and the non-perturbative regimes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Heavy quarkonium production can be described in two stages. The first is the short-distance production of a heavy quark pair, QQ, which can be described perturbatively and the second is the non-perturbative hadronisation of the heavy quark pair into quarkonium state, such as the J/\u03c8 meson. The non-perturbative part cannot yet be determined reliably, and must be determined using experimental results. After almost forty years of theoretical and experimental efforts, the hadronic production of quarkonia is still not fully understood. In the colour singlet model (CSM) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], the intermediate QQ state is assumed to be colourless, and has the same J P C quantum numbers as the final-state quarkonium. In the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach [8][9][10], all viable colour and spin-parity quantum numbers are allowed for the intermediate QQ state, and each configuration is assigned a probability to transform into the specific quarkonium state. The transition probabilities are described by universal long-distance matrix elements (LDME) determined from experimental data.",

Next-to-leading order CSM calculations [19,20] give a better description of the experimental data than leading order (LO) calculations at high J/\u03c8 transverse momentum (p T /c > M (J/\u03c8 )). However, CSM calculations still underestimate the prompt J/\u03c8 production cross-section. On the other hand, NRQCD calculations with LDME determined from CDF data [21] describe well the p T dependence of the prompt J/\u03c8 cross-section at both the Tevatron [22,23] and the LHC experiments [24][25][26]. The measured J/\u03c8 -from-b production cross-section and its dependence on p T at the LHC are in good agreement with predictions from fixed order plus next-to-leading logarithms (FONLL) [27] calculations.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c.

The same alignment and calibration information is propagated to the offline reconstruction, to ensure consistent and high-quality particle identification information for the trigger and offline. The larger timing budget available in the trigger with respect to LHC Run 1 also results in the convergence of the online and offline track reconstruction, such that offline performance is achieved in the trigger. The identical performance of the online and offline reconstruction achieved in this way offers the opportunity to perform physics analyses directly using candidates reconstructed in the trigger [45]. The storage of only the triggered candidates enables a reduction in the event size by an order of magnitude. The analysis described in this paper uses the online reconstruction for the first time in LHCb, and is checked the against the standard offline reconstruction chain.",
