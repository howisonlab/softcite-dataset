Charged-particle pseudorapidity density in pp collisions at LHC was also published by the CMS collaboration for NSD interactions [4], and by the ATLAS collaboration for a different event selection [5], not directly comparable with our measurements and those of CMS. We have used the first high energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 2.36 TeV, as well as a larger statistics data sample at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV, to determine the pseudorapidity density of charged-primary particles, 1 dN ch /d\u03b7, in the central pseudorapidity region (|\u03b7| < 1.4). According to commonly used models [6][7][8][9][10][11][12], an increase in dN ch /d\u03b7 of 17-22% for INEL events and of 14-19% for NSD events is expected in 2.36 TeV collisions relative to 0.9 TeV collisions.",

The multiplicity distribution of charged particles (the probability P (N ch ) that a collision has multiplicity N ch ) can be described by KNO scaling [13] over a wide energy range. KNO scaling means that the distribution N ch P (z), where z = N ch / N ch , is independent of energy. In full phase space, scaling holds up to the top ISR energy (pp at \u221a s = 62.2 GeV) [14]. Deviations from scaling are observed at higher energies, starting at 200 GeV with pp collisions at the SppS collider [15]. However, in limited central \u03b7-intervals scaling has been found to hold up to 900 GeV. The UA5 collaboration [16] observed scaling for non-single-diffractive events in restricted central \u03b7-intervals and its progressive violation with increasing \u03b7-ranges. The UA1 collaboration [17] also observed scaling in a larger interval |\u03b7| < 2.5. In inelastic events, deviation from KNO scaling was observed in full phase space already at ISR energies [14]. Such deviations are generally attributed to semihard gluon radiation (minijets) and to multi-parton scattering.",

At both energies, this background was also rejected by exploiting the correlation between the number of clusters of pixel hits and the number of tracklets (short track segments in the SPD, compatible with the event vertex, as described below).

This requires the detection of at least one charged particle in both the forward and backward hemispheres, which are separated by 4.5 units of pseudorapidity. In this subset, single-diffraction events are suppressed, therefore, model dependent corrections and associated systematic errors are reduced (see below). The selection efficiencies, MB OR for INEL events and MB AND for NSD events, are multiplicity dependent as illustrated in Fig. 2. As expected, the MB AND selection has a low efficiency for SD events, in particular at low multiplicities, where they contribute most. After these selections, the remaining background at 0.9 TeV was estimated, and corrected for, with the help of the control triggers. The background events (99% of which have no reconstructed tracklets) correspond to about 2% of the events in the INEL sample and to less than 0.01% in the NSD sample. The 2.36 TeV data sample was triggered by at least one hit in the SPD (MB SPD ) and this selection was used for both INEL and NSD analyses. After rejecting the background using the correlation between the number of pixel hits and the number of tracklets, the remaining background (93% of which has no reconstructed tracklets) was estimated to be 0.7%.

The singlediffraction production cross section at 0.9 TeV was measured by UA5 [27] in the kinematic range M 2 < 0.05s, where M is the mass of the diffractive system. The published value is a result of an extrapolation to low diffractive masses M < 2.5 GeV and therefore is model-dependent. There exist indications from measurements at lower energy, \u221a s = 546 GeV [28], and from phenomenological models [29] that this cross section value may be underestimated by up to 30%. We decided to use the published value, but we checked that our results stay within their systematic uncertainties, if instead we use a 30% higher single-diffractive cross section. At 1.8 TeV, the single-diffraction cross section was measured by E710 [30] and CDF [31] in the kinematic ranges 2 GeV 2 < M 2 < 0.05s and 1.4 GeV 2 < M 2 < 0.15s, respectively. As the CDF result includes significant model dependent acceptance corrections at low masses, we used the E710 measurement. The inelastic cross section at 1.8 TeV, needed for normalization, was taken from [32].

In order to classify an event as diffractive, the diffractive mass should satisfy a coherence condition (M 2 < Ks, where K = 0.05-0.15), which effectively provides a high-mass cut-off. PHOJET uses this coherence condition with K = 0.15 and we checked that, if we would further restrict diffractive masses using K = 0.05, our multiplicity results will practically not change. PYTHIA generates, with a low probability, SD events with very high diffractive masses. Therefore, we checked the stability of our results by imposing the tight coherence condition (K = 0.05) to generated SD events. This decreased the average multiplicities for the NSD samples by less then 2%, well within our systematic uncertainties.",

When implementing these experimental cuts in the event generators, the results were widely fluctuating and inconsistent with the measurements, possibly because the occurrence of large rapidity gaps is very sensitive to the model assumptions and process parameterizations. Therefore, for classification of DD events we used the process type information provided by the generators but we adjusted the fractions to the measured values. The values used take into account an increase of the DD fractions due to the pseudorapidity-gap definition as described in [33]. Note that the correction arising from unmeasured DD events is small, both because the cross section for DD is small and because the event selection efficiency is large in our samples.",

This method is similar to that used by the PHOBOS experiment with the first heavy-ion data from RHIC [34]. We start with the reconstruction of the position of the interaction vertex by correlating hits in the two silicon-pixel layers. The vertex resolution achieved with this simple method depends on the track multiplicity, and is typically 0.1-0.3 mm in the longitudinal (z) and 0.2-0.5 mm in the transverse direction. For events with only one SPD tracklet, the z-vertex position is determined by the point of closest approach to the mean beam axis. A vertex was reconstructed for 83% of events in the MB OR selection and for 93% of events in the MB AND selection. At the higher energy, in the MB SPD selection 93%  [30,33]. The measured DD fractions are scaled according to the prescription in [33]. Corresponding fractions calculated using PYTHIA and PHOJET are given for events within the diffractive-mass range covered experimen-tally (see text), and also without the restriction on diffractive-mass (parentheses). (b) Selection efficiencies for different classes of events: at 0.9 TeV, where the MB OR selection was used for INEL sample and MB AND for NSD sample; at 2.36 TeV, where the selection using the SPD only was used for both INEL  Using the reconstructed vertex as the origin, we calculate the differences in azimuthal (\u0394\u03d5, bending plane) and polar (\u0394\u03b8 , non-bending direction) angles of two hits, one in the inner and one in the outer SPD layer. Hit combinations, called tracklets, are selected by a cut on the sum of the squares of \u0394\u03d5 and \u0394\u03b8 , with a cut-off at 80 mrad and 25 mrad, respectively. The cut imposed on the difference in azimuthal angles would reject charged particles with a transverse momentum below 30 MeV/c; however, the effective transverse-momentum cut-off is determined by particle absorption in the material and is approximately 50 MeV/c. If more than one hit in a layer matches a hit in the other layer, only the hit combination with the smallest angular difference is used.",

For the 0.9 TeV sample, the number of zero-track events for |z| < 10 cm was estimated using triggered events without a reconstructed vertex. At 2.36 TeV, due to the different trigger (see Sect. 2), we have to use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate this number and therefore the results are more model-dependent than those at 0.9 TeV.

The latter number was corrected for beam-induced and accidental background as measured with the control triggers (see Sect. 2). A small correction, determined from simulations, is applied to the number of tracks due to events with no reconstructed vertex. In order to get the normalization for INEL and NSD events, we further corrected the number of events for the selection efficiency for these two event classes. For NSD events, we subtracted the single-diffractive contribution. The selection efficiencies depend on the charged-particle multiplicity, as shown in Fig. 2 for the 0.9 TeV data sample for different event classes (INEL, NSD, and SD). At both energies, the efficiency is close to 100% for multiplicities of one or above for the INEL class, and reaches 90% for multiplicities above two for the NSD class. The averaged combined corrections in number of events due to the vertex-reconstruction and the selection efficiencies for INEL collisions are 5% and 24% for 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV data, respectively. This correction is larger at the higher energy because of significantly smaller pseudorapidity coverage of the MB SPD selection compared with the MB OR selection and the necessity for large correction for zero-multiplicity events at this energy. For NSD collisions, at both energies, these event-number corrections are small (2% and 1% for 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV data, respectively) as a consequence of partial cancelation between adding non-observed ND and DD events, and subtracting triggered SD events. The resulting model-dependent correction factors due to the selection efficiencies applied to averaged charged-particle multiplicities for the NSD samples are 0.973 and 1.014 for 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV data, respectively.",

For pseudorapidity densities, when two values are given, they correspond to the pseudorapidities 0.0 and 1.4, respectively. The sign of the event-generator uncertainties indicates if the result using PHOJET corrections is higher (positive sign) or lower (negative sign) than that using PYTHIA corrections. For multiplicity distributions the values are given for |\u03b7| < 1. the unfolded spectrum produced with the unaltered response matrix determines the systematic uncertainty. Additional systematic uncertainties originate from the unfolding method itself, consisting of two contributions. The first one arises from statistical fluctuations due to the finite number of events used to produce the response matrix as well as the limited number of events in the measurement. The unfolding procedure was repeated 100 times while randomizing the input measurement and the response matrix according to their respective statistical uncertainties. The resulting uncertainty due to the response matrix fluctuations is negligible.

For the model comparisons we have used QGSM [6], three different tunes of PYTHIA, tune D6T [9], tune ATLAS-CSC [10] and tune Perugia-0 [11], and PHO-JET [12]. The PYTHIA tunes have been developed by three independent groups extensively comparing Monte Carlo distributions to underlying-event and minimum-bias Tevatron The ALICE measurements (squares) are compared to UA5 pp data [40] (triangles) and to CMS pp data at the LHC [4] (stars). Right: measured pseudorapidity dependence of dN ch /d\u03b7 at \u221a s = 2.36 TeV for INEL (full symbols) and NSD (open symbols) collisions. The ALICE measurement (squares) for NSD collisions is compared to CMS NSD data [4] (stars) and to model predictions, PYTHIA tune D6T [9] (solid line) and PHOJET [12] (dashed line). For the ALICE data, systematic uncertainties are shown as shaded areas; statistical uncertainties are invisible (smaller than data marks). For CMS data error bars show the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature data. Data from hadron colliders at lower energies have been used to fix the energy scaling of the parameters. Tune D6T uses the old PYTHIA multiple scattering and Q 2 -ordered showers, whereas the two other tunes use the new multiplescattering model provided by PYTHIA 6.4 and transversemomentum-ordered showering. Perugia-0 was not tuned for diffractive processes, which affects the validity of this tune for the lowest multiplicities. For final-state-radiation and hadronization, Perugia-0 adds parameters fitted to LEP data. The charged-particle density in the central rapidity region is mainly influenced by the infrared cut-off for parton scattering at the reference energy (1.8 TeV) and its energy dependence. Figure 6 (left) shows the charged-particle density as a function of pseudorapidity obtained for INEL and NSD interactions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 0.9 TeV compared to pp data from the UA5 experiment [40], and to pp NSD data from the CMS experiment [4]. The result is consistent with our previous measurement [2] and with UA5 and CMS data. Figure 6 (right) shows the measurement of dN ch /d\u03b7 for INEL and NSD interactions at \u221a s = 2.36 TeV compared to CMS NSD data [4] and to PYTHIA tune D6T and PHOJET calculations. Our results for NSD collisions are consistent with CMS measurements, systematically above the PHOJET curve, and significantly higher than the distribution obtained with the PYTHIA tune D6T. Note that in the CMS pseudorapidity-density measurement the contribution from charged leptons was excluded. This implies that the CMS value is expected to be approximately 1.5% lower than in our result, where charged leptons are counted as primary particles.",

The dashed and solid lines (for INEL and NSD interactions, respectively) show a fit with a power-law dependence on energy. Note that data points at the same energy have been slightly shifted horizontally for visibility that the errors in the deconvoluted distribution are correlated over a range comparable to the multiplicity resolution (see Fig. 4). We studied the significance of these fluctuations assuming an exponential shape of the corrected distribution in the corresponding multiplicity range. Applying the response matrix to this smooth distribution and comparing The ALICE measurement for |\u03b7| < 0.5 is compared to the UA5 data at the same energy [19]. In the inset the ratio of these two measurements is shown, the shaded area represents our combined statistical and systematic uncertainty, and the error bars those of UA5.

The gray bands indicate the systematic uncertainty. Distribution for NSD events are not normalized to unity but scaled down in such a way that the distributions for INEL and NSD events match at high multiplicities, which makes the difference at low multiplicity clearly visible.

Note that for |\u03b7| < 1.0 and |\u03b7| < 1.3 the distributions have been scaled for clarity by the factor indicated with the measured raw distribution, we find differences of up to two standard deviations in some of the corresponding raw data bins. Therefore, we conclude that while the structures are related to fluctuations in the raw data, they are not significant, and that the uncertainty bands should be seen as one-standard-deviation envelopes of the deconvoluted distributions.

At low multiplicities (<20) discrepancies are observed at both energies and for all models. At high multiplicities and for the 0.9 TeV sample, the PHOJET model agrees well with the data. The PYTHIA tunes D6T and Perugia-0 underestimate the data at high multiplicities and the ATLAS-CSC tune is above the data in this region. At 2.36 TeV, ATLAS-CSC tune of PYTHIA and, to some extent, PHOJET are close to the data. The ratios of data over Monte Carlo calculations are very similar in all three pseudorapidity ranges and suggests that the stronger rise with energy seen in the charged-particle density is, at least partly, due to a larger fraction of high-multiplicity events.",

Note that the mean multiplicities quoted in this table are those calculated from the multiplicity distributions and are therefore slightly different from the values given in Table 3. The value of the pseudorapidity density obtained when averaging the multiplicity distribution for |\u03b7| < 0.5 is consistent with the value obtained in the pseudorapidity-density analysis.

The results at 0.9 TeV are consistent with UA5 pp measurements at the same energy. At both energies, our data are consistent with the CMS measurement, and compared to various models for which they provide further constraints. None of the investigated models and tunes describes the average multiplicities and the multiplicity distributions well. In particular, they underestimate the increase in the average multiplicity seen in the data between 0.9 TeV and 2.36 TeV. At 0.9 TeV, the high-multiplicity tail of the distributions is best described by the PHOJET model, while at 2.36 TeV, PYTHIA tune ATLAS-CSC is closest to the data.",

The error bars represent the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties. The data at 0.9 TeV are displaced horizontally for visibility with negative binomial distributions. The shape evolution of the multiplicity distributions with energy was studied in terms of KNO-scaling variables, and by extracting reduced moments of the distributions. A slight, but only marginally significant evolution in the shape is visible in the data for z > 4, possibly indicating an increasing fraction of events with the highest multiplicity. This issue will be studied further using the data collected from forthcoming higherenergy runs at the LHC.
