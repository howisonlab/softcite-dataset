In contrast to inclusive jets, dijet correlation measurements provide access to partonic kinematics at leading order, and thus give better constraints on the behavior of \u2206g(x) as a function of gluon momentum fraction. Furthermore, dijet measurements at higher rapidity probe the lower x values where \u2206G is poorly constrained. In these proceedings, we present the first measurement of A LL for dijets with at least one jet reconstructed within the pseudorapidity range 0.8 < \u03b7 < 1.8 at STAR. The dijets were measured in polarized proton+proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 200 GeV. Values of A LL are determined for several distinct event topologies, defined by the jet pseudorapidities, and span a range of parton momentum fraction x down to x \u223c 0.01. The measured asymmetries are found to be consistent with the predictions of global analyses that incorporate the results of previous RHIC measurements. They will provide new constraints on \u2206g(x) in this poorly constrained region when included in future global analyses.",

When including the STAR 2009 inclusive jet results [3], the global analyses by the DSSV [1] and NNPDF [2] collaborations show, for the first time, a positive gluon polarization in the region of sensitivity. However in the low momentum fraction region, the gluon polarization is still poorly constrained. STAR has published several new results recently ( [4,5,6]). These new data will extend our reach in x using pion and jet results at forward rapidities, and also using higher collision energies.

In contrast, the data point measured at higher dijet invariant mass at the same dijet topology is sensitive to the larger x values (x 1 \u223c 0.5) as can be seen in Fig. 4. Coupled with the knowledge from the unpolarized parton distribution functions, the low momentum fractions x 2 are always dominated by gluons while x 1 are most often valence quarks. The kinematic region of the forward-forward dijet topology maximizes the partonic asymmetry; this feature can be seen from the partonic asymmetry as a function of dijet \u2206\u03b7 curve in Fig. 5. Future STAR pp 200 GeV data will improve the measurements in both low and high x regions.",
