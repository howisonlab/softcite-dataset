In the t \" t ! WbWb decay, the lepton plus jets final state is used, where one W boson decays leptonically and the other hadronically. The t \" t system is reconstructed using both small-radius and large-radius jets, the latter being supplemented by a jet substructure analysis. A search for local excesses in the number of data events compared to the Standard Model expectation in the t \" t invariant mass spectrum is performed. No evidence for a t \" t resonance is found and 95% credibility-level limits on the production rate are determined for massive states predicted in two benchmark models. The upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio of a narrow Z 0 resonance range from 5.1 pb for a boson mass of 0.5 TeV to 0.03 pb for a mass of 3 TeV. A narrow leptophobic topcolor Z 0 resonance with a mass below 1.74 TeV is excluded. Limits are also derived for a broad color-octet resonance with \u00c0=m \u00bc 15:3%. A Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon in a Randall-Sundrum model is excluded for masses below 2.07 TeV.",

            "text": "Despite its many successes, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is believed to be an effective field theory valid only for energies up to the TeV scale. Due to its large mass, the top quark is of particular interest for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and could potentially be connected with new phenomena. Several proposed extensions to the SM predict the existence of heavy particles that decay primarily to top quark pairs. This paper presents the results of a search for production of new particles decaying to top quark pairs using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4:7 fb \u00c01 of 7 TeV center-of-mass energy proton-proton (pp) collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2011. The search is carried out using the lepton plus jets decay channel where the W boson from one top quark decays leptonically (to an electron or a muon, and a neutrino) and the other top quark decays hadronically. This search uses a combination of resolved and boosted reconstruction schemes, defined by the cases when the top quark decay products are well separated or merged in the detector, respectively. In the resolved reconstruction scheme, the hadronically decaying top quark is identified by two or three distinct small-radius jets, while in the boosted reconstruction scheme one largeradius jet with substructure consistent with jets from a W boson and a b-quark is used. The boosted reconstruction scheme is more suitable for high-mass t \" t resonances as the top quark decay products become more collimated.",

Two specific benchmark models are chosen and are used throughout the rest of the paper. In the first model, a leptophobic topcolor Z 0 particle of width \u00c0 Z 0 =m Z 0 \u00bc 1:2% is considered as a resonance that is narrow with respect to the detector resolution of typically 10%. In the second model, a KK gluon (g KK ) of width \u00c0 g KK =m g KK \u00bc 15:3% is considered as a resonance that is broad with respect to the detector resolution.",

The CT10 [30] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used and the top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. Only events in which at least one of the W bosons decays leptonically (including decays to leptons) are produced. This corresponds to an effective cross section times branching ratio at approximate NNLO (next-to-next-to-leading-order) of 90.5 pb [31,32], obtained using the calculation described in Sec. VIII. Additional t \" t samples, generated with POWHEG [33] interfaced with PYTHIA or HERWIG, are used to evaluate the model uncertainty in the parton showering and fragmentation, as described in Sec.

Jets with radius parameters of R \u00bc 0:4 and R \u00bc 1:0 are used. For the small-radius R \u00bc 0:4 jets, topological clusters at the EM energy scale are used to form the jets [57], while for the large-radius R \u00bc 1:0 jets, locally calibrated topological clusters are used [57][58][59]. The usage of locally calibrated clusters ensures a more correct description of the energy distribution inside the large-radius jet, which is needed when using jet substructure variables, as described in Sec. V. Both the small-radius and large-radius jets have their final transverse momentum and pseudorapidity adjusted with energy-and -dependent correction factors. These are derived from simulation [57,60] and verified using data [57]. The small-radius jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and jj < 2:5, while large-radius jets must have p T > 350 GeV and jj < 2:0. Above this jet p T value, the large-radius jet trigger is more than 99% efficient.

The uncertainty has been calculated at approximate NNLO in QCD [31] with HATHOR 1.2 [32] using the MSTW2008 90% confidence level NNLO PDF sets [75] and PDF\u00fe S uncertainties according to the MSTW prescription [76]. These uncertainties are then TABLE II. Average uncertainty from the dominant systematic effects on the total background yield and on the estimated yield of a Z 0 with m \u00bc 1:6 TeV. The e\u00fejets and \u00fejets spectra are added. The shift is given in percent of the nominal value. The error on the yield from all systematic effects is estimated as the quadratic sum of all systematic uncertainties. Certain systematic effects are not relevant for the Z 0 samples, which is indicated with dots ( \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 ) in the  added in quadrature to the normalization and factorization scale uncertainty and found to give results consistent with the NLO\u00feNNLL calculation of Ref. [77] as implemented in Top++ 1.0 [78]. A cross section uncertainty from varying the top quark mass by AE1 GeV, added in quadrature to the scale and PDF\u00fe S uncertainties, is also included. The W\u00fejets normalization is varied within the uncertainty, dominated by statistics, of the data-driven determination, corresponding to 12% (10%) for the resolved selection in the e\u00fejets (\u00fejets) channel and 19% (18%) for the boosted selection in the e\u00fejets (\u00fejets) channel. Four variations of the flavor composition are considered, including the statistical uncertainty on their data-driven determination, the uncertainty on the extrapolation to different jet multiplicities, and the correlations between different flavor fractions, giving a change in the W\u00fejets event yield of about 10% per variation. The normalization uncertainty on the multijet background is 60%, coming from the difference between the matrix and jet-electron methods. The single top quark background uncertainty [38][39][40] is 7.7%. The normalization uncertainty of the Z\u00fejets sample is 48%, estimated using Berends-Giele scaling [48]. The diboson normalization uncertainty is 34%, which is a combination of the PDF uncertainty and additional uncertainties from each extra selected jet.",

The PDF uncertainty has a much larger effect on the t \" t mass spectrum in the boosted sample than in the resolved sample, with variations in the number of t \" t events increasing from 5% at 1 TeV to over 50% above 2 TeV, due primarily to the larger relative PDF uncertainties in the higher-mass (higher partonic x) regime.

This uncertainty also includes variations in the jet mass scale and the k t splitting scales within their uncertainties [60]. The uncertainty is smaller for the resolved selection, since the large-radius jets are only used indirectly there, in the veto of events that pass the boosted selection. For small-radius jets, the uncertainties in the JES, the jet reconstruction efficiency, and the jet energy   88, 012004 (2013) resolution are considered [57]. The b-tagging uncertainty is modeled through simultaneous variations of the uncertainties on the efficiency and rejection scale factors [61,83]. An additional b-tagging uncertainty is applied for high-momentum jets (p T > 200 GeV) to account for uncertainties in the modeling of the track reconstruction in dense environments with high track multiplicities [84]. The effect of uncertainties associated with the jet vertex fraction is also considered. The uncertainty on the Standard Model t \" t background due to uncertainties in the modeling of QCD initial-and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR) is estimated using ACERMC [36] plus PYTHIA Monte Carlo samples by varying the PYTHIA ISR and FSR parameters while retaining consistency with a previous ATLAS measurement of t \" t production with a veto on additional central jet activity [85]. The magnitude of the variations comes from a measurement of extra radiation in top quark events. Higher-order electroweak virtual corrections to the t \" t mass spectrum have been estimated in Ref. [86] and are used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty of the t \" t Monte Carlo sample normalization. The parton showering and fragmentation uncertainty on the t \" t background is estimated by comparing the result from samples generated with POWHEG interfaced with PYTHIA or HERWIG for the parton showering and hadronization.",

This is a hypothesis-testing tool that uses pseudoexperiments to search for local excesses or deficits in the data compared to the Standard Model prediction in binned histograms, taking the look-elsewhere effect into account over the full mass spectrum. The Standard Model prediction is allowed to float within the systematic uncertainties. After accounting for the systematic uncertainties, no significant deviation from the expected background is found. Upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio of the Z 0 and KK gluon benchmark models using a Bayesian technique, implemented in a tool developed by the D0 Collaboration [88]. The prior is taken to be constant in the signal cross section, which in this case is an excellent approximation of the reference prior that maximizes the amount of missing information [89], as given in Ref. [90]. The Bayesian limits are in good agreement with results obtained using the CL s method [91,92].

The numerical values of the upper limits on the cross section are given in Table IV (Z 0 ) and Table V (g KK ). The expected limits and uncertainty band are obtained using pseudoexperiments based on Poisson distributions for the number of entries in each bin. In the combination, the four disjoint spectra are used, corresponding to boosted and resolved selections, as well as e\u00fejets and \u00fejets decay channels. Due to the improvements in the analysis, the upper limits on the cross section for a Z 0 resonance at 1.6 TeV and a KK gluon resonance at 2.0 TeV are less than half the values that would be obtained by a simple rescaling of the previous best high-mass ATLAS limits [11] to account for the larger integrated luminosity.

The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4:7 fb \u00c01 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The t \" t system is reconstructed in two different ways. For the resolved selection, the hadronic top quark decay is reconstructed as two or three R \u00bc 0:4 jets, and for the boosted selection, it is reconstructed as one R \u00bc 1:0 jet. No excess of events beyond the Standard Model predictions is observed in the t \" t invariant mass spectrum. Upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio are set for two benchmark models: a narrow Z 0 resonance from Ref. [1] TABLE V. Upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio, at 95% C.L., for a Kaluza-Klein gluon decaying to t \" t, using the combination of all four samples.
