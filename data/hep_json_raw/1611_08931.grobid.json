The search is based on asymmetries in T-odd, triple-product correlation observables, where T is the time-reversal operator. The analysis uses a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . Events are selected having one electron or muon and at least four jets. The T-odd observables are measured using four-momentum vectors associated with tt production and decay. The measured asymmetries exhibit no evidence for CP-violating effects, consistent with the expectation from the standard model.",

Detailed experimental investigation of CP violation (CPV) in the strange and bottom quark sectors has been conducted over the past few decades [2]. The measured asymmetries are well described by the SM, but are too small to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe [3]. In contrast to the strange and bottom quark sectors, CPV in the top quark sector is relatively unexplored. In the SM, CPV in the production and decay of top quark-antiquark (tt) pairs is predicted to be very small [4]. However, in many theories of physics beyond the SM (see, for example, refs. [5,6] and references therein) sizable CP-violating effects could be observed, which have the potential to shed light on the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.",

The analysis exploits T-odd, triple-product correlations, where T is JHEP03 (2017)101the time-reversal operator. Several observables are measured, as proposed in refs.

The MadGraph generator accounts for the spin correlations between the top quark and antiquark. The mass of the top quark in the simulation is set to m t = 172.5 GeV.

Drell-Yan (DY) and W + jets processes are generated with MadGraph, and diboson events (WW, WZ, and ZZ) with pythia. The cross sections of W + jet and DY production are calculated with the fewz (v3.1) [24,25] program at NNLO, while the mcfm (v6.6) [26] program is used for the cross sections of diboson productions at NLO. The quantum chromodynamic (QCD) background is suppressed by the selection requirements (section 4) and is negligible in the signal region.",

Electrons, muons, photons, and neutral and charged hadrons are reconstructed and identified with the CMS particle-flow (PF) algorithm [28,29]. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum at the primary collision vertex, the corresponding cluster of energy deposits in the ECAL, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons associated with the track [30]. The momentum of muons is obtained from a global fit to signals registered by the silicon tracker and muon detectors [31].

The other b quark jet is then associated with the semileptonically decaying top quark candidate. The purity of the selected tt candidates is \u2248 92% after the \u03c7 2 selection, while single top quark production contributes with only \u2248 3% of the total number of events. The charge of the isolated lepton is used to distinguish between the b and b quark jets. The b quark jet charges are correctly assigned in \u2248 60% of the tt events. For the semileptonically decaying top quark, the analysis uses the mass variable M b , which is the invariant mass of the isolated lepton and the associated b quark jet. For the hadronically decaying top quark, the mass variable M jjb is used, which is the invariant mass of the two non-b quark jets and the associated b quark jet. As shown in figure 1, although the analysis does not depend on the simulated background events, there is reasonable agreement in the two mass-variable distributions between the data and the simulation. The distributions of the two mass variables for data events with positive and negative O i values are consistent with each other in both the electron and muon channels.",

The uncertainty related to pileup modelling is estimated by varying the inelastic pp cross section in the simulation by \u00b1 5% [40]. The uncertainties from the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies are determined by varying the data-to-simulation scale factors according to their uncertainties. The jet energy scale and resolution are varied according to their \u03b7-and p T -dependent uncertainties [28,36]. The scale factors used to correct the b tagging identification probabilities are varied according to their uncertainties [37]. Effects related to the modelling of the PDFs of the initial-state protons are estimated by varying the CT10 nominal prediction by its eigen-uncertainty sources. Each source is used to derive event-by-event weights, which are then applied to obtain a variation of the signal shape. The envelope of the variations is normalized to reflect a 68% confidence level [41]. The uncertainties related to the tt simulation are evaluated by varying the matrix-element-to-parton-shower matching thresholds and the factorization and renormalization scales by factors of 2.0 and 0.5 with respect to their nominal values in the simulation. A modelling uncertainty is determined through comparison to a tt sample generated with powheg. The uncertainty related to the modelling of the top quark p T spectrum in MadGraph is assessed by varying the weight applied by a factor of two. The uncertainty associated with the top quark mass is estimated by repeating the M b fit using different top quark masses. The observed difference is scaled to reflect an uncertainty of \u00b1 1 GeV in the mass [42]. These systematic uncertainties contribute to the intermediate stages of the analysis but are observed to largely cancel in the measurements of the CP asymmetry. Thus, the dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the statistical uncertainty in the measurements of possible detector bias (table 1).  Figure 3.

The A CP values are related to the generated A CP values through dilution factors D, applied as a multiplicative correction A CP = DA CP . The corrected asymmetries with the dilution factors applied (triangular points) are in agreement with the generator-level asymmetries, as shown by solid lines in figure 3, which are the results of fits to the corrected asymmetry values.

            "text": "The first search for CP-violating effects in top quark-antiquark events has been presented. The search is performed in the electron + jets and muon + jets final states, with one top quark assumed to decay hadronically and the other semileptonically. The search is based on a sample of proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The CP-violating asymmetries are measured using four T-odd, triple-product observables, where T is the time-reversal operator. A data control sample is used to verify that no significant spurious CP asymmetry is introduced by background processes, and to model the shape of the background in the asymmetry observables  Figure 5. Summary of the uncorrected (corrected) CP asymmetries A CP (A CP ) for the observables defined in eq. (1.2). The results for A CP are shown for the electron and muon channels separately and for their combination. The results for A CP are shown for the combined electron and muon channels, using the dilution factors from SM simulation of tt production. The inner bars represent the statistical uncertainties, and the outer bars the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. the semileptonically decaying top quarks. The background-subtracted distributions of the observables are used to compute the uncorrected asymmetries. The corrected asymmetries are obtained by using a multiplicative dilution factor derived from simulation. Both the uncorrected and corrected asymmetries are consistent with zero, in agreement with the expectation from the standard model.",
