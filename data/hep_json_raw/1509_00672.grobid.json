            "text": "The ATLAS experiment at the LHC has measured the Higgs boson couplings and mass, and searched for invisible Higgs boson decays, using multiple production and decay channels with up to 4.7 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. In the current study, the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W W , Z\u03b3, bb, \u03c4 \u03c4 , and \u00b5\u00b5 decay channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the couplings with mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the Standard Model including a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, and two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the measured mass of the scalar Higgs boson in the \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ decay modes, a lower limit is set on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of m A > 370 GeV in the \"hMSSM\" simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Results from direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons are also interpreted in the hMSSM. Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with W/Z (Z \u2192 , W/Z \u2192 jj) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of dark matter.",

Since then, the collaborations have together measured the mass of the particle to be about 125 GeV [3][4][5]. Studies of its spin and parity in bosonic decays have found it to be compatible with a J P = 0 + state [6][7][8]. Combined coupling fits of the measured Higgs boson production and decay rates within the framework of the Standard Model (SM) have found no significant deviation from the SM expectations [4,9,10]. These results strongly suggest that the newly discovered particle is indeed a Higgs boson and that a non-zero vacuum expectation value of a Higgs doublet is responsible for electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking [11][12][13]. The observed CP-even Higgs boson is denoted as h throughout this paper.",

Astrophysical observations provide strong evidence of dark matter that could be explained by the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (see ref. [14] and the references therein). If such decays are kinematically allowed, the observed Higgs boson [1,2] might decay to dark matter or other stable or long-lived particles which do not interact significantly with a detector [15][16][17][18][19][20]. Such Higgs boson decays are termed \"invisible\" and can be inferred indirectly through final states with large missing transverse momentum. The Higgs boson may also decay to particles that do interact significantly with a detector, such as gluons that produce jets, resulting in final states that cannot be resolved due to the very large backgrounds. These decays and final states are termed \"undetectable\". This paper presents searches for deviations from the rates of Higgs boson production and decay predicted by the SM, including both the visible and invisible decay channels, using ATLAS data. Simultaneous fits of multiple production and decay channels are performed after the removal of overlaps in the event selection of different analyses, and correlations between the systematic uncertainties are accounted for. The data are interpreted in various benchmark models beyond the SM, providing indirect limits on the BSM parameters. The limits make different assumptions than those obtained by direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons and invisible Higgs boson decays.",

These inputs include the search for a Higgs boson, produced through vector-boson fusion (VBF) and thus accompanied by dijets, that decays invisibly and results in missing transverse momentum (VBF \u2192 jj + E miss T ) [32]; the search for a Higgs boson, which subsequently decays invisibly, produced in association with a Z boson that decays to dileptons (Zh \u2192 + E miss T [33]); and the search for a Higgs boson, which afterwards decays invisibly, produced together with a W or Z boson that decays hadronically (W/Zh \u2192 jj + E miss T [34]). These searches are based on up to 4.7 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV and up to 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Each measurement or search classifies candidate events into exclusive categories based on the expected kinematic properties of different Higgs boson production processes. This both improves the sensitivity and enables discrimination between different Higgs boson production modes. Each search channel is designed to be mostly sensitive to the product of a Higgs boson production cross section and decay branching ratio. The combination of the visible decay search channels is used [10] to determine the couplings of the Higgs boson to other SM particles.

In all cases, it is assumed that the modifications of the couplings do not change the Higgs boson production or decay kinematics significantly. Thus the expected rate of any given process can be obtained through a simple rescaling of the SM couplings and no acceptance change due to kinematics in each BSM scenario is included. A simultaneous fit of the measured rates in multiple production and decay modes is used to constrain the BSM model parameters. The Higgs boson mass was measured by ATLAS to be m h = 125.36 \u00b1 0.37 (stat) \u00b10.18 (syst) GeV [3].

For the composite Higgs boson (see section 5), EW singlet (section 6), and invisible Higgs boson decays (section 9), a physical boundary imposes a lower bound on the model parameter under study. The confidence intervals reported are based on the profile likelihood ratio where parameters are restricted to the allowed region of parameter space, as in the case of thet \u00b5 test statistic described in ref. [40]. This restriction of the likelihood ratio to the allowed region of parameter space is similar to the Feldman-Cousins technique [44] and provides protection against artificial exclusions due to fluctuations into the unphysical regime. However, the confidence interval is defined by the standard \u03c7 2 cutoff, leading to overcoverage near the physical boundaries as demonstrated by toy examples. The Higgs boson couplings also have physical boundaries in the two-dimensional parameter space of the 2HDM (see section 7) and hMSSM (section 8) models, which are treated in a similar fashion.",

The 2HDM possesses an \"alignment limit\" at cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0 [66] in which all the Higgs boson couplings approach their respective SM values. The 2HDM also allows for limits on the magnitudes of the various couplings that are similar to the SM values, but with a negative relative sign of the couplings to particular types of fermions. These limits appear in the regions where cos(\u03b2 + \u03b1) = 0, as shown in table 5. For example, in the Type II model the region where cos(\u03b2 + \u03b1) = 0, corresponding to the sign change \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03b1, has a \"wrong-sign Yukawa limit\" [72,73] with couplings similar to the SM values except for a negative coupling to down-type quarks. The case for the Flipped model is similar, but with a negative coupling to both the leptons and down-type quarks. An analogous \"symmetric limit\" [73] appears in the Lepton-specific model. Figure 5 shows the regions of the [cos(\u03b2\u2212\u03b1), tan \u03b2] plane that are excluded at a CL of at least 95% for each of the four types of 2HDMs, overlaid with the exclusion limits expected for the SM Higgs sector.

The observed and expected exclusion regions in cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) depend on the particular functional dependence of the couplings on \u03b2 and \u03b1, which are different for the down-type quarks and leptons in each of the four types of 2HDMs, as shown in table 5.

Additional corrections in the MSSM would break the universality of down-type fermion couplings, resulting for example in \u03ba b = \u03ba \u03c4 . These are generally sub-dominant effects [81][82][83] and are not included. The MSSM includes other possibilities such as Higgs boson decays to supersymmetric particles, decays of heavy Higgs bosons to lighter ones [86], and effects from light supersymmetric particles [84], which are not investigated here. This model is therefore not fully general but serves as a useful benchmark, particularly if no direct observation of supersymmetry is made.",

Results from direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons are also interpreted in the hMSSM.
