An accurate mass reconstruction is mandatory to maximize the signal-to-backgound ratio, and hence have a good sensitivity to \u03b3\u03b3 resonances. The reconstructed width of the Higgs boson peak is expected to be fully dominated by the experimental resolution. The experimental resolution is composed by the single-photon energy measurement accuracy, as well as by the diphoton opening angle in space. For most of the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 topologies, the angular resolution plays an important role, and therefore it is important to get an accurate measurement of the photon direction of flight. The AT-LAS electromagnetic calorimeter allows to also measure the photon flight direction with an angular resolution, in case of unconverted photons, of about 14 mrad at \u03b7=0, a factor \u2248 4 smaller than the accuracy that is obtained using the average pp interaction point and its spread.

The leptonic decay of the boson is used both for trigger and offline event preselection. The analysis proceeds requiring exactly two b-tagged jets [18] with p T > 25 GeV.

            "text": "The invariant mass m 12 of the lepton pair closest to the Z mass must fulfill |m 12 \u2212 m Z | < 15 GeV. The invariant mass m 34 of the other pair is required to be lower than 115 GeV and greater than a threshold depending on the reconstructed 4-lepton mass. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the reconstructed Higgs particle, expected to be dominated by the experimental mass resolution for low m H values, varies between 4.5 (4\u00b5) GeV and 6.5 GeV (4e) for m H = 130 GeV. At high m H the reconstructed width is dominated by the intrinsic width (e.g. FWHM=35 GeV for m H =400 GeV). The expected contribution from SM background is estimated with Monte Carlo simulation, except the Z+jets process whose contribution is measured in data. The irreducible ZZ ( * ) process is predicted with an uncertainty of 15% (includes both quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon scattering), while the top estimation, predicted with an uncertainty of 10%, is validated with data control samples. The Z+jet(s) contribution is evaluated starting from a sample of Z+lepton-pair selected with no isolation or impact parameter requirements. This yield is then extrapolated to the signal region applying reduction factors estimated with MC simulation. The uncertainty on the event contamination from this source varies in the range 20% to 40%.   All channels presented in this paper are combined with a statistical procedure publicly available [22], which is again based on the modified frequentist method CLs [16]. The profile likelihood ratio is used as a test statistics, whose distribution function is obtained either with toy Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments, or using asymptotic analytic expressions [17]. The uncertainties of correlated experimental uncertainties (JES, luminosity,...), across different Higgs channels, are taken into account. A careful treatment of theory uncertainties is also made, paying again attention to those that are correlated, as for example the uncertainty on the Higgs boson production cross section [15]. Figure 7(a) summarizes the individual standalone exclusion limits associated to the Higgs boson channels discussed in this paper. The result of the combination of these results is shown in figure  Figure 7(b). The production of a Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% C.L. in the mass regions 144 < m H < 232 GeV, 256 < m H < 282 GeV, and 296 < m H < 466 GeV. Moreover, the mass regions between 160 and 220 GeV, and between 300 420 GeV, are excluded at least with 99",
