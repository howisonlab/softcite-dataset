            "text": "It is well known that oscillations between meson and antimeson, also called mixing, can occur when the flavor eigenstates differ from the physical mass eigenstates. These effects provide a mechanism whereby interference in the transition amplitudes of mesons and antimesons may occur. They may also allow for manifestation of CP violation (CPV) in the underlying dynamics [1,2]. Oscillations in the K 0 -K 0 [3], B 0 -B 0 [4] and B 0 s -B 0 s [5] systems are established; their oscillation rates are well-measured and consistent with predictions from the Standard Model (SM) [6]. After an accumulation of strong evidence from a variety of experiments [7][8][9], D 0 -D 0 oscillations were recently firmly established by LHCb [10]. The results were soon confirmed by CDF [11] and Belle [12].",

            "text": "3.773 GeV. The BESIII detector is a general-purpose solenoidal detector at the BEPCII [25] double storage rings. The detector has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of the full solid angle. We briefly describe the components of BESIII from the interaction point (IP) outwards. A small-cell main drift chamber (MDC), using a heliumbased gas to measure momenta and specific ionizations of charged particles, is surrounded by a time-of-flight (TOF) system based on plastic scintillators that determines the flight times of charged particles. A CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) detects electromagnetic showers. These components are all situated inside a superconducting solenoid magnet, that provides a 1.0 T magnetic field parallel to the beam direction. Finally, a multi-layer resistive plate counter system installed in the iron flux return yoke of the magnet is used to track muons. The momentum resolution for charged tracks in the MDC is 0.5% for a transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. The energy resolution for showers in the EMC is 2.5% (5.0%) for 1 GeV photons in the barrel (end cap) region. More details on the features and capabilities of BESIII can be found elsewhere [24]. High-statistics Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to evaluate the detection efficiency and to understand backgrounds. The geant4-based [26] MC simulation program is designed to simulate interactions of particles in the spectrometer and the detector response. For the production of \u03c8(3770), the kkmc [27] package is used; the beam energy spread and the effects of initial-state radiation (ISR) are included. The MC samples consist of the D D pairs with consideration of quantum coherence for all modes relevant to this analysis, non-D D decays of \u03c8(3770), ISR production of lowmass \u03c8 states, and QED and qq continuum processes. The effective luminosity of the MC samples is about 10 times that of the analyzed data. Known decays recorded by the Particle Data Group (PDG) [6] are generated with evtgen [28,29] using PDG branching fractions, and the remaining unknown decays are generated with lundcharm [30]. Final-state radiation (FSR) of charged tracks is taken into account with the photos package [31].",

Unbinned maximum likelihood fits are performed for all modes except for modes including \u03c9. For modes including an \u03c9, binned least-square fits are performed to the \u03c9 sidebandsubtracted U miss distributions. In each fit, the K e\u03bd or K \u03bc\u03bd signal is modeled by the MC-determined shape convoluted with a bifurcated Gaussian where all parameters are allowed to vary in the fit. Backgrounds for K e\u03bd are well described with a first-order polynomial. However, in the K \u03bc\u03bd mode, backgrounds are more complex and consist of three parts. The primary background comes from D \u2192 K \u03c0\u03c0 0 decay. To better control this background, we select a sample of D \u2192 K \u03c0\u03c0 0 in data by requiring E extra > 0.5 GeV, in which the U miss shape of K \u03c0\u03c0 0 is proved to be basically the same as that in the region of E extra < 0.2 GeV in MC simulation. The selected K \u03c0\u03c0 0 sample is used to extract the resolution differences in the U miss shape of K \u03c0\u03c0 0 in MC and data, and to obtain the D \u2192 K \u03c0\u03c0 0 yields in E extra > 0.5 GeV region. Then, in fits to U miss , the K \u03c0\u03c0 0 is described by the resolution-corrected shape from MC simulations and its size is fixed according to the relative simulated efficiencies of the E extra > 0.5 GeV and E extra < 0.2 GeV selection criteria. The second background from K e\u03bd events is modeled by a MC-determined shape. Its ratio to the signal yields is about 3.5% based on MC studies and is fixed in the fits. Background in the third category includes all other background processes, which are well described with a first-order polynomial.",

We compare the cases with and without this requirement and the resultant relative changes in Fits to the M BC and U miss spectra could induce systematic errors by the modeling of the signal and background shape. The MCdetermined signal shapes convoluted with a Gaussian are found to describe the data well, and systematic uncertainties from the modeling of the signal are assumed to be negligible. To estimate uncertainties from modeling of backgrounds, different methods are considered. For the CP ST yields, we include an additional background component to account for the \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D D process with a shape determined by MC simulation whose yield is determined in the fit. The uncertainties in the fits to M BC are uncorrelated among different tag modes, and the obtained change on y CP is 0.001. For the DT semileptonic yields, the polynomial functions that are used to describe backgrounds in our nominal fits are replaced by a shape derived from MC simulations. For the K \u03bc\u03bd mode, the size of the main background K \u03c0\u03c0 0 is fixed in our nominal fit, so the statistical uncertainties of the number of selected K \u03c0\u03c0 0 events introduces a systematic error. To estimate the associated uncertainty, we vary its size by \u00b11 standard deviation based on the selected K \u03c0\u03c0 0 samples. Systematic uncertainties due to the U miss fits are treated as positively correlated among different tag modes. We take the maximum change on the resultant y CP , that is 0.006, as systematic uncertainty.",

Relative systematic uncertainties are listed for each tag mode in percent, while the resulting absolute uncertainties on y cp are shown in the last column. Negligible uncertainties are denoted by \"-\". with our current sensitivity. Hence, K 0 S \u03c0 0 is assumed to be a clean CP mode, as its background level is very low. As a conservative treatment, we study DT yields of (K 0 S \u03c0 0 , K 0 S \u03c0 0 ) to verify its pure CP-odd eigenstate nature and the CP-odd environment of the D 0 D 0 pair. The observed numbers of this DT signals are quite small, and we estimate the dilution of the C -odd initial state to be less than 2% at 90% confidence level. This affects our measurement of y CP by less than 0.001. The purity of the K 0 S \u03c0 0 mode is found to be larger than 99%. Due to the complexity of the involved non-resonant and resonant processes in K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and K 0 S \u03c9, the CP-purities of these tag modes could be contaminated. We take the mode K + K \u2212 as a clean CP-even tag to test K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , and take K 0 S \u03c0 0 to test K 0 S \u03c9 and K 0 S \u03b7. The CP-purities of K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , K 0 S \u03c9 and K 0 S \u03b7 are estimated to be larger than 89.4%, 93.3% and 93.9%, respectively. Based on the obtained CP purities, the corresponding maximum effect on the determined y CP is assigned as systematic uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties from different sources are assumed to be independent and are combined in quadrature to obtain the overall y CP systematic uncertainties. The resultant total y CP systematic uncertainties is 0.007.",

For a subset of the ST events, the so-called Double Tag (DT) events, this tagged partner D meson is also observed via one of the semileptonic decay channels. CP violation in D decays is known to be very small[18], and can be safely neglected. Therefore, B D CP\u2213 \u2192l can be obtained as",
