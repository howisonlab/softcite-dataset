The measurement covers the kinematic range 60 < W < 220 GeV and Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 , where W is the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy and Q 2 is the photon virtuality. The exponential slope, b, of the t dependence of the cross section, where t is the squared four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex, has been measured, yielding b = 4.3 +2.0 \u22121.3 (stat.) +0.5 \u22120.6 (syst.) GeV \u22122 . This constitutes the first measurement of the t dependence of the \u03b3 p \u2192 \u03a5 (1S)p cross section.",

The interaction may be viewed at leading order as shown in Fig. 1: the photon fluctuates into a qq state of small transverse size, which interacts with partons in the proton through a two-gluon colour-singlet state, forming a heavy vector meson. Thus the cross section is proportional to the square of the gluon density in the proton. A characteristic feature of heavy VM photoproduction is the rapid rise of the cross section with the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy, W . This can be explained through the increasing gluon density with decreasing fractional momentum, x \u221d 1/W 2 (where the x region accessible in heavy-quark production at HERA is 10 \u22124 < x < 10 \u22122 ).",

For proton-dissociative events, the simulation was supplemented by the JETSET 7.3 MC package [32]. For exclusive vector-meson production, s-channel helicity conservation (SCHC) was assumed. An exponential dependence, e \u2212b|t| , was assumed for the differential cross section in t with a slope parameter b = 4.5 GeV \u22122 , consistent with the value obtained for exclusive J /\u03c8 electroproduction [5,6]. The W dependence of the \u03b3 p \u2192 \u03a5 p cross section was parameterised as \u221d W \u03b4 , with \u03b4 = 1.2 [8]. Electromagnetic radiative corrections associated with the decay muons are of the order of 1% [33] and were not included in the simulation.",

The simulated contributions from the Bethe-Heitler (exclusive and proton dissociative) process and from the \u03a5 (1S), \u03a5 (2S) and \u03a5 (3S) resonances are also presented. 65 As in the previous paper [8], the BH distributions were normalised to the data in the range [5.0-15.0] GeV excluding the [9.0-11.0] GeV mass window where contributions from the \u03a5 resonances are expected. For the determination of the slope parameter for exclusive \u03a5 (1S) production, only events in the mass window [9.33-9.66] GeV were considered. The width of the mass window was chosen in order to avoid excessive smearing of the t variable and to retain a good signal-to-background ratio. According to MC studies, 71% of all reconstructed \u03a5 (1S) events are expected in this window; the relative contaminations of \u03a5 (2S) and \u03a5 (3S) states with respect to \u03a5 (1S) are 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively. The contribution from the \u03a5 (2S) and \u03a5 (3S) states was neglected for the extraction of the slope parameter b. After scanning no cosmic ray muon candidates were found in the signal mass window. The value of the slope parameter for exclusive \u03a5 (1S) production was determined as follows: the sum of simulated distributions of all contributing processes was fitted to the observed event yields in the signal mass window [9.33-9.66] GeV in the four t bins shown in Fig. 3. A binned Poissonian log-likelihood function, ln(L), was used. The expected number of Bethe-Heitler background events was fixed to the value obtained from the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 spectrum outside the signal region as described earlier. Due to insufficient statistics it was not possible to evaluate the contribution of protondissociative \u03a5 (1S) events in the final sample with the present",
