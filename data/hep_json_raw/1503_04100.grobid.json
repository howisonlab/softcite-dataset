We show how this can be achieved without the need to carry out a likelihood fit of the angular distribution to the measured events. Instead, we apply the method of moments that relies both on the orthogonality of angular functions and the estimation of integrals by Monte Carlo techniques. The big advantage of this method is that the joint distribution of all observables can be easily extracted, even for very few events. The method of moments is shown to be robust against mismodeling of the angular distribution. Our main result is an explicit algorithm that accounts for systematic uncertainties from detector-resolution and acceptance effects. Finally, we present the necessary process-dependent formulas needed for direct application of the method to several rare decays of interest.",

However, the method we describe in the following is general and applies to all decay or scattering processes that can be formulated in terms of an orthogonal basis of angular functions. We find a previous work [1] that advocates this method chiefly for the determination of angular observables in non-leptonic B decays but also mentions the applicability to semileptonic decays. Our aim is to improve upon this previous work by studying the uncertainties that are introduced by mismodeling of the angular distribution, and by working out a recipe to determine and unfold detector effects. The latter is crucial for the application of the method to real data. We show that the method of moments has several major advantages over the usual approach based on likelihood fits:",

For a uniangular distribution and O 10 6 MC samples, we find that the error on the mean of each matrix element is O 10 \u22124 .

Second, in the absence of detector effects, the method of moments does not rely on model assumptions for the partial-wave composition of the PDF. This is explicitly shown for the case of higher partial waves in multibody final states. Third, we develop a systematic method for the determination of detector effects that lead to dilution and mixing of the angular observables. We present an algorithm to calculate the necessary unfolding matrix, which is computationally feasible only when using the method of moments. The algorithm also accounts for higher partial waves. Fourth, the joint distribution of the angular observables resulting from the method of moments is well approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution even for small number of events N \u223c 30 both for the ideal uniform acceptance and a realistic example. This facilitates the precise transfer of correlation information to subsequent theoretical analyses.
