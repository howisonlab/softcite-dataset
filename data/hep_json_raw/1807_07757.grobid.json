            "text": "The significant enhancement of the J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor (R AA ) at the LHC energies compared to the SPS and RHIC energies [1,2] indicates an almost leveled competition between suppression and (re)generation of charmonium states in nucleus\u2212nucleus collisions in the TeV regime. The R AA is defined as the ratio of production yields in nucleus\u2212nucleus collisions (dN AA ) and pp collisions (dN pp ) scaled with number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N coll ): R AA = dNAA Ncoll \u00d7 dNpp . Heavy-quark pairs (QQ), i.e. bb and cc, are produced in initial hard processes, thus the quarkonium bound state production is subject to the full evolution of the collision. A suppression of quarkonium states in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected due to the color-screening effect, which is based on a Debye screening of the color charge [3]. In competition with the color-screening effect, where initial QQ pairs are separated and not able to form a bound state, is the (re)combination effect. It is based on the non-zero probability that quasi-free quarks and anti-quarks move close enough in space and momentum to form a quarkonium bound state. The influence on the quarkonium production rates of this effect is strongly coupled to the QQ production cross-section (\u03c3 QQ ) [4,5]. Both effects are highly sensitive to the properties of the QGP and should induce diverging behavior on the differential quarkonium production, e.g. momentum distribution and elliptic flow.",

This includes the J/\u03c8-R AA measurement in Xe\u2212Xe collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.44 TeV, multi-differential J/\u03c8-yield measurements and differential measurements of the bottomonium R AA in the forward rapidity range and the elliptic flow of J/\u03c8 at forward and mid-rapidity in Pb\u2212Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV.  The ALICE experiment measures charmonia and bottomonia in their leptonic decay channels. The dimuon channel is measured at forward rapidity in the range of 2.5 < y lab < 4 with the muon spectrometer, while the dielectron channel is measured at mid-rapidity in the range of \u22120.9 < y lab < 0.9 with the central-barrel detectors. A more detailed description of the ALICE experiment can be found in [9]. The results presented in the following are based on Pb\u2212Pb (A Pb = 208) and Xe\u2212Xe (A Xe = 129) collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV and \u221a s NN = 5.44 TeV, respectively, provided by the LHC. The ALICE experiment was capable to record integrated luminosities of L Pb int \u2248 225 \u03bcb \u22121 and L Xe int \u2248 0.34 \u03bcb \u22121 at forward rapidity and L Pb int \u2248 13 \u03bcb \u22121 and L Xe int \u2248 0.25 \u03bcb \u22121 at mid-rapidity, respectively. The large difference, especially for the Pb\u2212Pb sample, is due the fact that at mid-rapidity minimum bias events were selected, while at forward rapidity special muon triggers were applied during data taking [2,6].",

The measurement of the J/\u03c8 R AA as a function of the average number of participants N part [10] in the forward [6] and mid-rapidity range is shown in Fig. 1 together with the J/\u03c8 R AA for Pb\u2212Pb collisions. At forward rapidity, the results for both collision systems agree with each other for similar N part within uncertainties. A comparison of the measurements at forward rapidity to a transport model [7,8] is shown in Fig. 2. The model is based on the thermal rate equation and contains continuous J/\u03c8 dissociation and regeneration in the QGP and the hadronic phase. The two collision systems as well as data and model agree well, which indicates that similar \u221a s NN and N part lead to similar relative contributions of suppression and (re)generation. However, strong conclusions are still difficult due to the uncertainties, which for the model are driven by the uncertainties on \u03c3 cc . In J/\u03c8-R AA measurements as a function of rapidity in \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV Pb\u2212Pb collisions, ALICE observed an opposing trend between data [11] and cold-nuclear-matter model calculations [12,13]. These models expected an increase of R AA with rapidity, while a decrease was observed in the data. The large data sample from \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV Pb\u2212Pb collisions allows a multi-differential analysis of J/\u03c8 yields as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum and centrality [14]. First preliminary results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b. In Fig. 3a the J/\u03c8 yield as a function of rapidity for different p T intervals in the 20% most central events is illustrated. The rapidity dependence is then fitted with exponential functions, the resulting slopes are depicted in Fig. 3b. The slope decreases with increasing p T and shows only a weak dependence on centrality.  Another way to obtain more information about the different charmonium production mechanisms is the analysis of the elliptic flow. J/\u03c8 from (re)combined cc quarks should inherit the charm elliptic flow, which was observed in measurements of D-mesons [15]. The results at forward rapidity show a significant positive J/\u03c8 elliptic flow in all studied p T bins. Within the large statistical uncertainties the measurement at mid-rapidity agrees with the one at forward rapidity [16]. A comparison to model calculations [8,17] is shown in Fig. 4. Both models describe the data in the low-p T regime, where the elliptic flow of the models is generated by their regeneration component. At high p T the models clearly underestimate the measured elliptic flow. The question remains open how the elliptic flow of J/\u03c8 above p T \u2248 5 GeV/c is generated.  Pb\u2212Pb collisions [18], compared to transport [19,20] and hydro-dynamical [21] model calculations.",

An increase of the \u03a5(1S) suppression towards more central events is observed, but due to the not precisely known feed-down fraction, the amount of direct \u03a5(1S) suppression is an open question. The measurement is shown in Fig. 5 and compared with three model calculations (two transport [19,20] and one hydro-dynamical model calculation [21]), which all agree with the data within the uncertainties. The two transport models are shown without a regeneration component, both versions agree with the data, which indicates that a regeneration component for bottomonium should be negligible at LHC energies. The \u03a5 (2S) suppression is significantly stronger then the one of the \u03a5(1S) visible in the ratio of the \u03a5 (2S) over \u03a5(1S) R AA : R \u03a5(2S) AA /R \u03a5(1S) AA = 0.28 \u00b1 0.12(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.). For the \u03a5(1S) R AA neither a significant dependence on p T nor on y is observed [18].",

The results indicate that quarkonia production at the LHC is a combination of suppression and (re)generation, strongly dependent on the \u03c3 QQ . However, there are still unanswered questions, e.g. the reason for the significant J/\u03c8 elliptic flow at higher p T or the amount of direct \u03a5(1S) suppression, which hopefully can be answered in the near future.",
