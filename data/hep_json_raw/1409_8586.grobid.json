[2][3][4]). This asymmetry is sensitive to CP violation in the mixing of neutral B mesons. The neutral B 0 meson and its antiparticleB 0 are flavor eigenstates, formed from a mixture of two mass eigenstates. The time evolution of this two-state system results in flavor-changing B 0 \u2192B 0 andB 0 \u2192 B 0 transitions. Violation of charge-parity (CP) symmetry may occur due to this process if the probability for a B 0 meson to transform into aB 0 meson is different from the reverse process. When a meson produced in the B 0 eigenstate decays semileptonically to a final state f, the charge of the lepton reveals the meson flavor at the time of decay. In such decays, \"wrong-sign\" transitions, like B 0 \u2192f, can happen only due to the transition B 0 \u2192B 0 \u2192f. The flavorspecific (semileptonic) asymmetry is defined in terms of partial decay rates \u0393 as a d",

The largest contribution comes from the detection asymmetry, where the dominant uncertainty is due to the limited size of the calibration samples.

The systematic effect from any residual tracking asymmetry is estimated by using J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 decays [18]. The uncertainty from a possible pion nuclear-interaction charge asymmetry is estimated to be 0.035%, by using a parameterization [11] of the measured cross sections of pions on deuterium [19] and the LHCb detector simulation. The second largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the knowledge of the B \u00fe background and is dominated by the B \u00fe production asymmetry. Uncertainties arising from the B \u00fe fraction, decay-time model, and acceptance are also taken into account. Other b -hadron backgrounds are expected from semileptonic \u039b 0 b and B 0 s decays and from hadronic B decays. The fraction of background from \u039b 0 b \u2192 D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de\u00fe \u03bc \u2212\u03bd \u03bc X n decays, where X n represents any neutral baryonic state, is estimated to be roughly 2% by using the ratio of \u039b 0 b to B 0 production cross sections [20], simulated efficiencies, and the branching ratio of [21]. The \u039b 0 b production asymmetry is estimated to be \u00f0\u22120.9 AE 1.5\u00de%, determined from the raw asymmetry observed in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J=\u03c8pK \u2212 [22] and subtracting kaon and proton detection asymmetries. The uncertainty on the \u039b 0 b production asymmetry results in a systematic uncertainty on a d sl of 0.07%. The systematic effect from an estimated 2% contribution from B 0 s decays is small, since the production asymmetry vanishes due to the fast B 0 s oscillations. Hadronic decays B \u2192 D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de\u2212 DX, where the D meson decays semileptonically to produce a muon, have a different k-factor distribution compared to the signal.
