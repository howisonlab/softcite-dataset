The asymmetry in the Dalitz plot linear slopes Ag = (g + \u2212 g \u2212 )/(g + + g \u2212 ) is measured to be A c g = (\u22121.3 \u00b1 2.3) \u2022 10 \u22124 by studying \u223c 3.1 \u2022 10 9 K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays and A n g = (2.1 \u00b1 1.9) \u2022 10 \u22124 by studying \u223c 91 \u2022 10 6 K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays.

            "text": "More than 40 years after its discovery in the mixing of neutral kaons, the full understanding of CP violation is far from being reached. Two recent breakthroughs spread light over this puzzling phenomenon: In the late 90s the experiments NA48 and KTeV confirmed the earlier indication from NA31 experiment for direct CP-violation in K 0 system. Secondly, in the beginning of this century the CP-violating processes were found in B mesons field by the experiments Belle and Babar. In order to explore possible non-Standard Model (SM) enhancements to heavy-quark loops which are at the core of direct CP-violating processes, various systems must be studied. In kaons, besides the \u01eb \u2032 /\u01eb parameter in K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays, promising complementary observables are the rates of GIM-suppressed rare kaon decays proceeding through neutral currents, and an asymmetry between K + and K \u2212 decays to three pions.",

In order to reach a high accuracy in the measurement of the charge asymmetry parameter A g , the highest possible level of charge symmetry between K + and K \u2212 was a crucial requirement in the choice of beam, experimental apparatus, strategy of data taking and analysis. A novel beam line ( Fig. 1) with two simultaneous charged beams of opposite charges was designed and built in the high intensity hall (ECN3) at the CERN SPS. The charged particle beams were produced by 400 GeV protons with high intensity from the SPS impinging on a beryllium target. Charged particles with momentum (60 \u00b1 3) GeV/c were selected symmetrically by an achromatic magnet system ('achromat') which separates vertically the two beams and recombines them again on the same axis. Frequent inversion of the magnetic field polarities in all the beamline elements provides a high level of intrinsic cancellation of the possible systematic effects in the beam line.",

The reason for a similar precision of the results given in (6) and 7, despite a factor of \u223c 30 in the collected statistics, is the fact that the population density of the Dalitz plot is more favourable in the K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mode and c 9 for K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and 7 for K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay mode. d The trigger error 0.9 in (6) is an upper limit for eventual charge asymmetric response of the trigger system for K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays and it is limited by the statistics in the control sample used for this estimation; for K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays this error is included in the total systematic error. The external uncertainty 0.2 in (7) arises from the experimental precision on g and h 5 .",
