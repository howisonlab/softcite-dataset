The neutrino selection criteria have been chosen so as to maximize the rejection of the atmospheric background with respect to possible signals produced by the self-annihilation of weakly interactive massive particles accumulated in the centre of the Sun. After data unblinding, the number of neutrinos observed was found to be compatible with background expectations. The results obtained were compared to the fluxes predicted by the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and 90% upper limits for this model were obtained. Our limits are competitive with those obtained by other neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and SuperKamiokande, which give ANTARES limits for the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-section that are more stringent than those obtained by direct search experiments.",

Much of this evidence comes from its gravitational effects on the motion of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and from the large scale structure of the Universe. The existence of dark matter is a key component of our present standard cosmological model, and results from the study of the CMB anisotropies and gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters further support its existence (for a review of the evidence, candidates and constraints, see [1] and [2]).",

            "text": "One of the most favoured hypothesis is that dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that are embedded in the visible, baryonic part of the galaxies and surround them in the form of a halo. There are a variety of candidates for WIMPs, among which those provided by theories based on supersymmetry (SUSY) or universal extra dimensions (UED) attract a great deal of interest. In some classes of SUSY, the lightest particle is stable due to the conservation of R-parity that forbids its decay to standard particles, making it a good candidate as a dark matter WIMP.",

WIMPs can scatter elastically in the Sun or the Earth and become trapped in their gravitational potential wells, accumulating in sizeable numbers over the age of the solar system, therefore a very wide region in the Galaxy must have contributed, reducing the dependence on the detailed structure of the dark matter halo. The WIMPs proposed by SUSY are Majorana fermions that can self-annihilate, giving rise to standard particles. Neutrinos will be at the end of the decay chain of the products of the WIMP self-annihilation, they can escape these astrophysical objects and be detected by neutrino telescopes on the Earth.",

The OMs are looking 45 \u2022 downwards in order to optimise their acceptance to upgoing light and to avoid the effect of sedimentation and biofouling. The length of the lines is 450 m and the horizontal distance between neighbouring lines is 60-75 m. The absolute time accuracy is ensured at the millisecond level by the UTC time provided by the GPS system connected to the clock system of the detector. The relative time between the elements of the detector is achieved by calibration of the lines in the laboratory with short light pulses, by the use of a 25 MHz clock system and by the operation of a series of optical beacons distributed along the lines that emit short light pulses through the water. A relative timing of the order of one nanosecond is reached. Additional information on the detector can be found in reference [4].",
