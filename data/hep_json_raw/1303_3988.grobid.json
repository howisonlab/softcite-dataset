The analysis is based on endpoint determinations in kinematic distributions. In addition to the unconstrained fit for three masses, the neutrino and W boson masses can be constrained to standard values; in the maximally constrained fit, the top quark mass is found to be Mt = 173.9 \u00b1 0.9 (stat) +1.2 \u22121.8 (syst) GeV.",

            "text": "In many proposed extensions of the Standard Model, there is a new Z 2 symmetry, like R parity in Supersymmetry (SUSY), under which the new physics is odd and the known particles are even. New physics particles are thus produced in pairs and decays must terminate in a stable particle. Such particles are candidates for dark matter and escape direct observation in the CMS detector [1]. We have developed a model independent method to simultaneously extract all unknown masses in a decay chain. With the production of pairs of neutrinos, dileptonic tt resembles the generic new physics topology. Thus, we test this method in data by simultaneously computing the top quark, W boson and neutrino masses. Going beyond the general study of the technique, we also fix the W and neutrino masses to their known values and perform a measurement of the top quark mass. This measurement is competitive in the dilepton channel and does not rely on Monte Carlo simulation. More details are available in Ref. [2].",

In particular, endpoints of distributions are determined and related to the underlying masses. This analysis uses the extension of transverse mass called M T 2 [3]. M T 2 is the minimum parent mass consistent with observed kinematics. We have three unknowns, M \u03bd , M W , and M t , so we partition the tt decay in order to create three mass variables [4]. Two M T 2 subsystem variables are combined with the bl invariant mass to simultaneously extract the three masses. Figure 1 details the partitioning of the event topology for the M T 2 variables. In general, the resulting variables depend on the magnitude of the transverse upstream momentum, P T [5]. To remove this dependence, we project all momenta perpendicular to P T and compute M T 2\u22a5 . From [  Figure 1. We partition the tt decay into subsystems. For a third variable, we use the bl invariant mass, which is in many cases the same as the third possible M T 2 variable we could form.",
