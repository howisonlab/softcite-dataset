            "text": "Hadronic decays of the \u03c4 lepton are very important for studying QCD phenomena at a low-energy scale. Various decay modes including an \u03b7-meson represent a wide class of such decays, which are still poorly studied. One of the important tasks in this field is to test effective chiral theories [1,2,3,4]. The \u03c4 decay amplitudes in these theories are based on an effective Lagrangian of pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector mesons with U(3) L \u00d7 U(3) R symmetry. On the other hand, for some decays the branching fractions as well as spectral functions of the final states can be predicted using the vector dominance model (VDM). Another important issue is testing the relations between the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 and the spectral function in \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7\u03bd \u03c4 decay predicted by conservation of vector current (CVC) and isospin symmetry [5]. For all of the above tasks, precise measurements of the branching fractions as well as detailed studies of the final-state invariant mass distributions are highly desirable.",
