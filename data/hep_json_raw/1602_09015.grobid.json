The asymmetry is characterized by the rapidity difference between top quarks and antiquarks (\u2206y), and measured in the final state with two charged leptons (electrons and muons). The inclusive asymmetry, corrected to the entire phase space at parton level, is measured to be A tt FB = 0.12 \u00b1 0.13, consistent with the expectations from the standard-model (SM) and previous CDF results in the final state with a single charged lepton. The combination of the CDF measurements of the inclusive A tt FB in both final states yields A tt FB = 0.160 \u00b1 0.045, which is consistent with the SM predictions. We also measure the differential asymmetry as a function of \u2206y. A linear fit to A tt FB (|\u2206y|), assuming zero asymmetry at \u2206y = 0, yields a slope of \u03b1 = 0.14 \u00b1 0.15, consistent with the SM prediction and the previous CDF determination in the final state with a single charged lepton. The combined slope of A tt FB (|\u2206y|) in the two final states is \u03b1 = 0.227 \u00b1 0.057, which is 2.0\u03c3 larger than the SM prediction.",

            "text": "The forward-backward asymmetry of the production of top-quark and antiquark pairs (tt) in high-energy protonantiproton collisions is an observable unique to the Tevatron experiments. It quantifies the preference of top quarks to follow the proton direction, \"forward,\" instead of the antiproton direction, \"backward.\" At leading order (LO), quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts no net asymmetry in tt production. All asymmetric effects come from interference effects with electroweak and higherorder QCD amplitudes [1]. The top-quark-pair forwardbackward asymmetry (A tt FB ) measurement program at the Tevatron uses the proton-antiproton initial state with center-of-mass energy at 1.96 TeV to probe both the higher-order effects of the standard model (SM) and scenarios beyond the SM. This complements the precision measurements of top-quark physics at the LHC, where top-quark-pair production is dominated by gluon-gluon interactions and therefore the asymmetric effect is more subtle to measure [1,2]. Previous measurements showed tensions between the experimental results of A tt FB [3,4] and the SM theoretical calculations [1]. This article reports the final measurement of A tt FB by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) experiment.",

The differential cross section d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 * was expanded in Legendre polynomials and the mild asymmetry enhancement was attributed to the term linear in cos \u03b8 * . Since many features of top-quark-pair production are well described by the SM, such as the inclusive cross section [20] and the differential cross sections as functions of the transverse momentum of the top quarks (p T,t ), m tt , etc. [21], any contribution from non-SM dynamics that would affect the top-quark asymmetry would need to have minimal impact on these properties to preserve consistency with experimental constraints.

These measurements use the entire data set collected by the CDF detector during Tevatron Run II, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.1 fb \u22121 . The chief experimental challenges are: 1) the reconstruction of the signal kinematic properties needed to calculate the observed asymmetry, and 2) the transformation of the observed asymmetry, derived from experimentally-observed quantities, into the parton-level asymmetry, which requires corrections for experimental effects. The reconstruction of the kinematic properties is complicated by the presence of two final-state neutrinos and the ambiguity in associating the b andb jet with the lepton of appropriate charge. The two final-state neutrinos leave the kinematic properties of the signal experimentally underconstrained, introducing assumptions and reconstruction ambiguities that degrade the precision of the measurement. For each event, we use observed kinematic quantities and probability densities derived from simulation to construct a kinematic likelihood that is a function of the unobservable quantities. From that we extract the probability-density distribution for the top-quark rapidity difference. In addition, the difficulty in determining, event-by-event, whether a b jet originates from a bottom quark or antiquark introduces a further two-fold ambiguity in the proper reconstruction of the W -boson decays, due to the two possible lepton-jet pairings. We reduce the degradation of the results due to these reconstruction difficulties by means of an optimization. This aims at minimizing the total uncertainty as evaluated by repeating the analysis on several ensembles of simulated experiments that mimic the actual experimental conditions. As a result, improved selection criteria and use of both lepton-jet pairings for each event, opportunely weighted, leads to an 11% expected improvement in the total uncertainty. Finally, determination of partonlevel results from the observed asymmetries is achieved with a Bayesian-inference technique tested and tuned using simulated samples under various configurations.",

A series of scenarios with various A tt FB values, including those inspired by the d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 * measurement, is also described in this section. The top-quark-pair reconstruction of the momenta of the top (anti-)quarks is described in Sec. III. We estimate the parton-level results using the Bayesian-inference technique described in Sec. IV, and employ an optimization procedure to minimize the expected uncertainties on the inclusive measurement of A tt FB as illustrated in Sec. V. Validations of the reconstruction and correction methodology are shown in Sec. VI. The estimation of systematic uncertainties is described in Sec. VII. We present the final measurements of both the inclusive A tt FB and the differential measurement of A tt FB as a function of |\u2206y| in Sec. VIII. The combination of the dilepton results and the lepton+jets results is shown in Sec. IX, followed by conclusions in Sec. X.",

Chargedparticle trajectories (tracks) are reconstructed with a silicon microstrip detector and a large open-cell drift chamber in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field. Projectivetower-geometry electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters located outside the solenoid provide electron, jet, and missing transverse energy (E / T ) detection [23]. Electrons are identified by matching isolated tracks to clusters of energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Jets are identified as narrow clusters of energy deposits in the calorimeters consistent with collimated clusters of incident hadrons. A non-zero missing transverse energy indicates an imbalance in the total event transverse momentum [23]. Beyond the calorimeters are multilayer proportional chambers that provide muon detection and identification in the psuedorapidity [5] region |\u03b7| \u2264 1.0.",

The first contains ensembles of simulated samples, each generated with a different choice for the true A tt FB , relying on the measurement of top-quark differential cross section [19]. This measurement suggested that the potential A tt FB excess could be due to an additional contribution to the linear term of d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 * . Samples with genuine asymmetries in the range \u22120.1 < A tt FB < 0.3 are simulated by reweighting the powheg sample with appropriate additional linear contributions as functions of cos \u03b8 * to the cross section. We refer to these samples as the \"reweighted powheg MC samples.\" The second category contains a number of benchmark beyond-SM (BSM) scenarios generated with the LO generator madgraph [28]. These include models containing a t-channel Z boson with a mass of 200 GeV/c 2 [29] or a s-channel gluon with an axial coupling (axigluon) with various properties. The axigluon scenarios we simulate include a model with an axigluon near the tt production threshold with pure axial coupling and mass of 425 GeV/c 2 (425 GeV Axi) [30], three models with light axigluons with lefthanded, pure axial, and right-handed couplings and mass of 200 GeV/c 2 (200 GeV AxiL/A/R) [31], and two models with heavy axigluons with a pure axial coupling with opposite signs to top quarks and to light quarks and masses of 1.8 and 2.0 TeV/c 2 (1.8/2.0 TeV Axi) [3].",

The goal of the optimization is to minimize the quadrature sum of the expected total statistical uncertainty and the background systematic uncertainty, as other uncertainties are expected to be small. Besides the statistical uncertainty due to the limited data sample size, the uncertainty of the partonlevel A tt FB measurement receives a contribution from the resolution of the reconstructed \u2206y. This contribution is dominated by events in which the reconstructed value of \u2206y differs significantly from the true parton-level value. Reducing this fraction of poorly reconstructed events effectively reduces the uncertainty of the measurement. The usual reconstruction method of only using the solution that maximizes the likelihood [11] suffers from two primary problems: 1) the algorithm occasionally selects the wrong lepton-jet pairing and 2) the algorithm occasionally gives the highest likelihood values to a set of solutions to Eq. (2) that is different from the one corresponding to the real event within the right lepton-jet pairing. To ameliorate these problems we calculate the probability distributions associated to both options of lepton-jet pairings and use them to calculate weights instead of choosing the maximum-likelihood solution.

The uncertainty for |\u2206y| < 0.5 is larger because of the large bin migrations in that region, which reduce the statistical power of the data.",

The distributions of p T,tt , p z,tt , and m tt from data are shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c) and compared to the signal and background models. The agreement between data and the predictions is good. The distribution of reconstructed \u2206y is shown in Fig. 3(d). The A tt FB result is extracted from this distribution.  Figure 4 shows the reconstruction resolution, defined as the difference between reconstructed and generated values of \u2206y, estimated for events from the powheg MC samples. The distribution shown in this figure is obtained by summing the posterior-probability distribution of the reconstruction resolution over all events in the sample, where each event is weighted equally. In 61% of the cases the \u2206y is reconstructed within 0.5 of its true value. The detector smearing matrix S[p][r] is shown in Fig. 5. The efficiencies [p] in the four bins are approximated to linear functions of A tt FB and are shown in Fig. 6. We test the parton-level A tt FB estimation procedure with the reweighted powheg MC samples. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties based on a sample of 70 000 simulated events that meet the selection criteria. No bias is observed. In addition, we test the estimation procedure with the LO SM calculations from pythia [25], alpgen [41], and herwig [42] as well as a series of benchmark non-SM scenarios described in Sec. II. The results are shown in Fig. 8. We do not expect the estimation of A tt FB to be unbiased in all non-SM scenarios, since the assumptions on the p z,tt , p T,tt , and m tt distributions we made in topquark-pair reconstruction no longer hold, both due to the effect of non-SM dynamics and because these samples are  Table I. For each plot, all other optimization parameters are held at their optimal values.",

Figure 9 shows a comparison of A tt FB (|\u2206y| < 0.5) and A tt FB (|\u2206y| > 0.5) between the measured values from the reweighted powheg MC samples and their input values. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties with the entire powheg MC sample which is over a factor of 100 larger than the data.

Since we introduce likelihood terms based on the NLO SM dynamics in the top-quark-pair reconstruction, and use powheg samples to quantify the detector responses, the results in this article should be interpreted based on these assumptions. We have estimated the potential bias in the top-quark-pair reconstruction and the detector responses due to these assumptions in two ways, and list the larger one in Table III as the NLO assumption systematic uncertainty. As shown in Sec. VI, the results have negligible bias in the scenario where the deviation between the truth and the NLO SM prediction is in the linear term of d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 * , thus the NLO assumption systematic uncertainty estimated is negligible in comparison with other uncertainties. A more conservative way to estimate the NLO assumption systematic uncertainty is to set the uncertainty to be equal to the difference between the generated A tt FB in the pythia MC sample with LO SM and the measured A tt FB with the same sample, using the measurement procedure applied to data. While we expect the difference between LO and NLO SM kinematics to be larger than the difference between NLO SM kinematics and higher order kinematics [8], we report this conservative estimate in our final result in Table III and generated values for \u2206y from events in the nominal powheg tt MC after all the event-selection criteria.

The correction and parton-level A tt FB estimation procedures are different in the two measurements. Thus, the corresponding uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated. The effects due to the uncertainties in the parton shower model, the jet-energy scale, the initial-and final-state radiation, the color-reconnection model, and the parton-distribution functions are estimated in identical ways.
