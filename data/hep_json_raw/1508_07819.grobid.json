The analysis exploits the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The cross section is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the diphoton system and of the associated jets. Results corrected for detector effects are compared with predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, as well as with predictions beyond the standard model. For isolated photons with pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 2.5, and with the photon of largest and next-to-largest transverse momentum ( p \u03b3 T ) divided by the diphoton mass m \u03b3 \u03b3 satisfying the respective conditions of p \u03b3 T /m \u03b3 \u03b3 > 1/3 and >1/4, the total fiducial cross section is 32 \u00b1 10 fb.",

            "text": "In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations announced the observation [1][2][3] of a new boson with a mass of about 125 GeV, with properties consistent with expectations for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The Higgs boson (H ) is the particle predicted to exist as a consequence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism acting in the electroweak sector of the SM [4][5][6]. This mechanism was suggested more than fifty years ago, and introduces a complex scalar field, which gives masses to W and Z bosons [7][8][9][10][11]. The scalar field also gives mass to the fundamental fermions through a Yukawa interaction [5]. Couplings and spin of the new boson are found to be consistent with the SM predictions [12][13][14][15][16]. A measurement of the pp \u2192 H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 differential cross section as a function of kinematic observables investigates possible deviations in distributions related to production, decay, and additional jet activity. It provides e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch a check of perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and can point to alternative models in the Higgs sector. A similar analysis has been carried out by the ATLAS Collaboration in diphoton and four-lepton decay channels [17][18][19].",

A modification in the corresponding distributions or in the p \u03b3 \u03b3 T spectrum could signify new contributions to gluon-gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson (ggH) [22]. The variables defined by requiring at least two accom-panying jets are related to production of H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 through vector boson fusion (VBF); however, given the low event yield after selecting two jets, no other selection is applied to enhance this production mechanism.

Its central feature is a superconducting solenoid, 13 m in length and 6 m in diameter, which provides an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. The core of the solenoid is instrumented with trackers and calorimeters. The steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid is equipped with gas-ionisation detectors used to reconstruct and identify muons. Charged-particle trajectories are measured using silicon pixel and strip trackers, within |\u03b7| < 2.5. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) surround the track-ing volume and cover the region |\u03b7| < 3. The ECAL barrel extends to |\u03b7| < 1.48, while the ECAL endcaps cover the region 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.0. A lead and silicon-strip preshower detector is located in front of each ECAL endcap in the region 1.65 < |\u03b7| < 2.6. The preshower detector includes two planes of silicon sensors that measure the transverse coordinates of the impinging particles. A steel and quartz-fibre Cherenkov calorimeter extends the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. In the (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane, for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystal arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from points slightly offset from the nominal interaction point. In the endcap, the ECAL arrays matching the HCAL cells contain fewer crystals. To optimize the energy resolution, the calorimeter signals are calibrated and corrected for several detector effects [24]. Calibration of the ECAL uses the \u03c6-symmetry of the energy flow, photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , and electrons from W \u2192 e\u03bd and Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays. Changes in the transparency of the ECAL crystals due to irradiation during the LHC running periods and their subsequent recovery are monitored continuously and corrected, using light injected from a laser system.",

Events are selected using triggers requiring two photons with different thresholds in energy in the transverse plane (E T ), respectively, E T > 26 and >18 GeV for the leading and subleading photons, and through other complementary selections. One selection requires a loose calorimetric identification based on the distribution in energy in the electromagnetic cluster, and loose isolation requirements on photon candidates. The other selection requires a photon candidate to have a high value of R 9 variable, defined as the sum of the energies deposited in the array of 3\u00d73 crystals centred on the crystal with highest energy deposition in the supercluster, divided by the energy of the supercluster. Photons that convert to e + e \u2212 pairs before reaching the calorimeter tend to have wider showers and smaller values of R 9 than unconverted photons. High trigger efficiency is maintained by having both photons satisfy either selection. The measured trigger efficiency is 99.4 % for events satisfying the diphoton preselections described in Sect. 4.",

The CT10 [33] set of parton distribution functions (PDF) is used in the calculation. The powheg generator is tuned following the recommendations of Ref.

The Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [37], which uses the CTEQ5L PDF, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L1 [38]. The cross section for the ggH process is reduced by 2.5 % for all values of m H to accommodate its interference with nonresonant diphoton production [39]. The pythia 6 generator is used alone for the VH (where V represents either the W or Z boson) and tt H processes with the CTEQ6L1 PDF [38] and Z2* tune.

These variables are introduced to explicitly correlate the shower topology and isolation variables with \u03b7 and p T . Furthermore, during the BDT training, the \u03b7 and p T background distributions are reweighted to match the distributions in the signal. As a result, for a given requirement on the BDT output, efficiencies for photon identification are almost independent of \u03b7 and p T , as can be seen in Fig. 1, which provides less modeldependent efficiency corrections for comparison of data and MC expectations at the particle level. A loose selection is applied on the BDT output for photons detected in the barrel  region, while a tight selection is applied to endcap photons, with respective mean efficiencies of 95 and 90 % for signal photons. Photon efficiencies in signal samples are corrected for the difference in efficiency between data and simulation as measured with Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events, treating electrons as photons by reweighting the electron cluster variable R 9 to that of the R 9 distribution of signal photons.

[12], as that would create a bias in the result. To improve the performance beyond the simple classification using the R 9 variable in the reference sequential analysis, referred to as \"cut-based analysis\" in Ref. [12], an event categorization is introduced that is based on the estimated energy resolution. The photon energies are corrected using a multivariate regression technique for the containment of showers in clustered crystals, for shower losses of photons that convert in the material upstream of the calorimeter, and for effects from pileup, based on shower variables and variables related to positions of photons in the detector studied in \u03b3 +jets simulated events. The energy response to photons is parameterized through an extended form of the Crystal Ball function [49] with a Gaussian core and two power law contributions. The regression provides an estimate of the parameters of the function, and therefore a prediction for the distribution in the ratio of the uncorrected supercluster energy to the true energy. The correction to the photon energy is taken as the inverse of the most probable value of this distribution. The standard deviation of the Gaussian core provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the energy (\u03c3 E ).",

To ensure that the decorrelation is performed independent of the \u03b7 distribution of the training sample, in a first step a transformation is applied to make \u03c3 E /E independent of E and \u03b7. A \u03b3 +jets MC sample is used to build the fully decorrelated variable, that covers a wide range in \u03b7 and p T . The decorrelation is performed by making a change of variable, replacing the probability distribution in \u03c3 E /E by its cumulative distribution function cd f (\u03c3 E /E). This function follows a uniform distribution [50] and removes any corre-lation between \u03c3 E /E and (E,\u03b7). Since the \u03b7 dependence is removed, this variable is not suitable for estimating a perevent mass resolution, which is non-uniform in the detector. A second step is therefore introduced to restore the correlation of the energy resolution with photon \u03b7 in a H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 MC sample with m H = 123 GeV (statistically independent of the simulated events used to model the signal), and recover thereby a dependence of \u03c3 E on \u03b7 for the photons of interest. In this step a new change of variable is performed, replacing the previous \u03c3 E /E with the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of \u03c3 E /E(\u03b7). The impact of the particular p T spectrum used for this step is only modest for the correlation of \u03c3 E with \u03b7, which is in any case dominated by the material distribution in front of the ECAL and by calorimeter performance. The advantage of such a two-step procedure is that it offers a decorrelated \u03c3 E /E variable that is uncorrelated with E and does not depend on the \u03b7 distribution of the training sample. It provides the typical energy resolution at a given \u03b7 of the detector. The final result can be interpreted as an estimator of the average energy resolution at a particular value of \u03b7.",

A sample of events with a Higgs boson produced in association with just a single jet, called powheg HJ, is also generated with powheg+minlo [44]. This sample has NLO accuracy for 0jet and 1-jet production, while it is only leading-order (LO) for 2-jet final states. Both samples set the damping factor hfact in powheg at 100 GeV to reproduce the predicted p T distribution of the Higgs boson from hqt [35,36]. This factor minimizes emission of extra jets beyond those in the matrix element in the limit of large p T , and enhances contribution from the powheg Sudakov form factor as p T approaches 0.

The uncertainties in the ggH mechanism, PDF choice, and the renormalization and factorization scales are computed with hres, powheg, powheg+minlo and mad-graph5_amc@nlo, as described above, while the branching fraction for all production mechanisms, as well as the scale and PDF for the associated production mechanisms are taken from Ref.

Distributions for inclusive observables computed with hres, powheg, and madgraph5_amc@nlo, and jet-related observables computed with powheg, powheg+minlo and madgraph5_amc@nlo, including latest higher-order corrections, are compatible within their uncertainties, and also compatible with the data.   [20]. Theoretical uncertainties in the renormalization and factorization scales, PDF, and branching frac-tion are added in quadrature. The error bars on data points reflect both statistical and systematic uncertainties. In each distribution, the last bin corresponds to the sum over the events beyond the bins shown in the figure. For each graph, the bottom panel shows the ratio of data to theoretical predictions from the powheg generator sitivity to discriminate between spin-2 and spin-0 hypotheses. Figure 5 (upper left) shows the p T distribution for the leading jet, which is sensitive to higher-order QCD effects, and show, respectively, the distribution of the rapidity difference between the two jets, the Zeppenfeld variable, and the azimuthal difference between the Higgs boson and the dijet system. These angular variables are sensitive to the VBF topology, and large contributions from anomalous couplings are not observed in data.
