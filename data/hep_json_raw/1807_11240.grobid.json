In this article, measurements of the nuclear modification factors R AA of primary charged particles and of light neutral mesons in Pb-Pb, in Xe-Xe and in p-Pb collisions in a wide p T range and different centrality classes are discussed. We compare the nuclear modification factors obtained for different collision systems as a function of transverse momentum, collision centrality as well as charged particle multiplicity (dN ch /d\u03b7). We also present comparison of experimental results to model calculations.",

            "text": "Partons originating from initial hard scatterings lose their energy in the hot and dense QCD matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which result in suppression of high p T hadrons reported by several experiments [1,2,3,4,5], known as \"jet quenching\". Light flavor hadrons are powerful probes to measure the suppression, because they can be measured in a wide transverse momentum (p T ) range with high precision. The modification of particle production at high p T is quantified by the nuclear modification factor R AA , which is the ratio of particle yields in AA collisions to that in pp collisions at the same centerof-mass energy scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions N coll , R AA = dN AA /dp T N coll \u00d7 dN pp /dp T = dN AA /dp T T AA \u00d7 d\u03c3 pp /dp T (1) where N AA and N pp are particle yields in AA and pp collisions and \u03c3 pp is production cross section in pp collisions respectively. The nuclear overlap function T AA = N coll /\u03c3 pp INEL is determined from the Glauber model of the nuclear collision geometry and \u03c3 pp INEL is the total inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross section [6]. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Charged particles are measured by the Inner Tracking system (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in the central barrel of the ALICE apparatus [8,9]. Concerning identified particles, this article covers the production of neutral mesons while results for other identified particles are presented in [10]. Nuclear modification factors have a strong centrality dependence and are similar at the two collision energies. As p T spectra become harder at higher collision energy, this similarity in R AA indicates larger parton energy loss in a hotter and denser QCD medium produced at the higher collision energy. Fig. 1   [11,12]. R AA of \u03c0 0 at two collision energies is also similar, as well as that of primary charged particles. Furthermore, the behavior of R pPb at high p T is the same as that of primary charged particles (Fig. 2 (right)). We also present a comparison of the measured R AA of \u03c0 0 with theoretical models in Fig. 2 (left). The model calculations by Djordjevic et al. [13,14] and Vitev et al. [15,16] give a quantitatively good description of p T and centrality dependence of R AA . ",

The pp reference is interpolated from p T spectra in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 and 7 TeV by using a power-law parameterization in order to determine nuclear modification factors. The nuclear modification factor exhibits a strong centrality dependence with a minimum at p T = 6-7 GeV/c and an almost linear rise in the higher p T region. In particular, the yield in the most central collisions (0-5%) is suppressed by a factor of about 6 at minimum with respect to the scaled pp reference. R AA reaches a value of 0.6 at the highest p T interval of 30-50 GeV/c. A similar characteristic p T dependence of R AA is observed in both Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions. Fig. 3 (left) shows the comparison of R AA between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions for the same charged particle multiplicity dN ch /d\u03b7 ranges and their ratios. In the most central Xe-Xe collisions (0-5%), the nuclear modification is consistent with that in 10-20% central Pb-Pb collisions over the entire p T range. While a similar R AA is found for comparable charged particles multiplicity dN ch /d\u03b7 , the respective mean number of participants N part are significantly different. N part is 236 \u00b1 2 in the 0-5% centrality class in Xe-Xe, but 263 \u00b1 4 in the 10-20% centrality class in Pb-Pb collisions [19,20]. In the 30-40% Xe-Xe (40-50% Pb-Pb) centrality class, agreement of R AA is also found within uncertainties at similar N part of 82 \u00b1 4 (86 \u00b1 2). A detailed comparison of nuclear modification factors as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 in Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions for three selected p T regions is shown in Fig. 3 (right). A remarkable similarity in R AA between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions is observed for dN ch /d\u03b7 > 400. In a simplified radiative energy loss model, the average energy loss is proportional to the energy density and to the square of path length L in the medium \u0394E \u221d \u03b5 \u2022 L 2 [21]. Therefore, the comparison of the measured R AA in two different collision systems can provide insight into path length dependence of medium-induced parton energy loss.",

The fully corrected p T spectra of primary charged particles in the kinematic range of 0.15 < p T < 50 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.8 have been measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV with ALICE [7]. A significant improvement of systematic uncertainties related to the tracking efficiency motivated the reanalysis of data in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. Fig. 1 (left) shows nuclear modification factors of primary charged particles as a function of p T in nine centrality classes.",

R pA is consistent with unity at high p T , which demonstrates that the strong suppression observed in central Pb-Pb collisions is related to the formation of a hot and dense QCD medium. In addition, R AA of \u03c0 0 have been measured in 0.4 < p T < 30 GeV/c in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, as shown byFig. 2 (left). One of its advantages compared to inclusive charged particles is well defined fragmentation function for an identified hadron. Thus, understanding the production of identified hadrons in pp collisions is also important baseline in this study. The maximum p T reach is extended to 30 GeV/c, compared to previous results at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV",
