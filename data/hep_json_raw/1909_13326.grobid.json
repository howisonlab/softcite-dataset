            "text": "Physical and biological range uncertainties limit the clinical potential of Proton Beam Therapy (PBT). In these proceedings, we report on two research projects, which we are conducting in parallel and which both tackle the problem of range uncertainties. One aims at developing software tools and the other at developing detector instrumentation. Regarding the first, we report on our development and pre-clinical application of a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo (MC) simulation toolkit Fred. Concerning the letter, we report on our investigations of plastic-scintillator-based PET detectors for particle therapy delivery monitoring. We study the feasibility of Jagiellonian-PET detector technology for proton beam therapy range monitoring by means of MC simulations of the \u03b2 + activity induced in a phantom-by-proton beams and present preliminary results of PET image reconstruction. Using a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Fred and plastic-scintillator-based PET detectors, we aim at improving the patient treatment quality with protons. DOI:10.5506/APhysPolB.51.9",

The protonbeams range is particularly affected by biological and physical uncertainties in a heterogeneous patient body. Therefore, to assure target coverage, medical physicists currently apply up to about 1 cm safety margins around the tumor volume, which lead to the unwanted irradiation of the healthy tissues surrounding the tumor [2].",

It is calculated as D RBE = D \u00d7 RBE, where D is the physical dose expressed in Gy and RBE is the Relative Biological Effectiveness. By definition, in conventional therapy with photons RBE = 1.0, therefore, physical and biological doses are equal and correlated with clinical response. Protons have an increased biological effectiveness compared to photons, i.e. RBE is larger than one. Currently, in clinical routine, the RBE of protons is assumed to be constant and equal to 1.1 [3]. This convention neglects complex, often nonlinear dependency of the RBE on such parameters as penetration depth, Linear Energy Transfer (LET), dose, fractionation scheme, tissue type and endpoint, cell cycle phase or oxygenation level. These dependencies might affect the effective proton range, i.e., introduce biological range uncertainty and thus affect the dose to the surrounding tissue and Organs at Risk (OAR). Modification of proton physical dose by RBE, which is an uncertain weighting factor, makes the correlation of proton biological dose and clinical effect of tumor irradiation uncertain, and unification of clinical studies comparing the effectiveness of different radiation modalities challenging.",

In fact, physical range uncertainties, occurring due to patient mispositioning or Computed Tomography (CT) scanner calibration introducing Hounsfield Unit (HU) to stopping power conversion, could cause differences between treatment plan and treatment delivery. Monte Carlo simulations and range monitoring methods are essential in PBT to guarantee that the physical dose is accurately delivered and, therefore, to reduce the biological and physical range uncertainties in a patient body. along with activities of our group (dark gray/orange color) aiming to improve PBT quality.

Nowadays, the use of a variable RBE is being discussed among the PBT scientific community. We perform biological dose calculations with variable RBE and investigate biological range uncertainties by means of MC simulations of patient CT images exploiting the MC dose calculation tool Fred [4,5]. Fred offers a unique combination of features: accuracy of an MC code including biological dose computation, flexibility of a research tool, and high-dose calculation speed due to GPU-acceleration. These characteristics are impossible to achieve with the currently available commercial TPS and general purpose MC codes such as Geant4/FLUKA [6,7].",

The MC calculation time for this case was about 10 min (9 \u00d7 10 8 primary protons, 2 \u00d7 10 6 p + s tracking rate). The mean dose to Planning Target Volume (PTV), calculated with Fred using variable RBE model proposed by Carabe [8], is increased with respect to the clinically applied constant RBE = 1.1 assumption of about 3 Gy(RBE), whereas the maximum dose to the brain stem OAR increases by about 4 Gy(RBE). Our results show that incorporation of the variable RBE model in patient dose calculation increases the dose in PTV and OAR with respect to constant RBE assumption. This is especially important when OARs are very close to or overlap with the PTV as it occurs frequently in H&N patients. Considering variable RBE hypothesis in the proton therapy clinic could be essential as the increased biological dose deposited to OARs that exceeds clinical dose constraints can be potentially associated with the increased normal tissue complication probability and, therefore, an increased risk of necrosis or secondary cancer. The use of the fast MC dose computation tool Fred for physical and biological dose recalculation of patient treatment plans (retrospectively and prospectively) can provide additional clinical information for medical physicists and medical doctors, and can potentially prevent inaccuracies in patient treatment.",

A modular, lightweight and portable design of J-PET enables flexibility in detector configuration and easy installation. Increasing the number of J-PET detector layers, increases the detection efficiency of the system.",

            "text": "We performed comprehensive MC simulations using the GATE toolkit [20] and reconstructions of 3D \u03b2 + activity distributions using the CASTOR software [21]. The aim was to characterize the sensitivity of the J-PET for proton beam range detection. We investigated single and multi-layer cylindrical and dual-head configurations of the J-PET modules that can be possibly applied for the in-room range monitoring. The list-mode TOF-MLEM reconstruction (5 iterations with 500 ps TOF resolution without regularization) takes into account random events, scatter, attenuation and normalization corrections. Eventually, the reconstructed PET-activity profiles can be correlated with the position of dose distal fall-off (Fig. 4, right) and used for proton beam range monitoring. In this manuscript, we present preliminary results for one of the investigated setup configurations, i.e. a single layer J-PET barrel (Fig. 5). Figure 4 illustrates a cross section through the centre of the beam of 3D dose distribution deposited in a 5\u00d75\u00d720 cm 3 PMMA phantom by 10 8 protons of nominal energy 150 MeV (top left) and the same cross section of reconstructed 3D distribution of \u03b2 + activity produced by the beam in the phantom (bottom left). The activity map was reconstructed in the 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 mm 3 voxel grid. The scintillator strips' detection efficiency is taken into account in MC simulations. The expected spatial and time resolutions of J-PET with wavelength-shifting strips (WLS) [22] is taken into account through plastic length discretization used in the simulations and image reconstruction.  Figure 4 (right) presents the MC simulated profiles of: (i) proton dose deposition in the PMMA phantom, (ii) \u03b2 + activity produced in the phantom, and (iii) actual signal detected by J-PET barrel from \u03b2 + activity. The results show that the J-PET detector is feasible to acquire the \u03b2 + activity produced during proton therapy treatment and that the offline 3D reconstruction of PET activity images is possible using the CASTOR toolkit. The characterization of J-PET sensitivity for proton beam range detection is currently an ongoing research activity.",

Taking advantage of the Fred accuracy and time performance possible due to the GPU acceleration, we aim at improving quality assurance and treatment planing in Krak\u00f3w PBT facility. A Monte Carlo study of J-PET detector feasibility performed in the frame of the project suggests that this technique might be considered as a novel proton beam therapy range monitoring approach.",
