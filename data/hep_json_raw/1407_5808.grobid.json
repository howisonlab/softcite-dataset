It has been attributed to mechanisms that involve initial-state effects, such as gluon saturation and colour connections forming along the longitudinal direction, and final-state effects, such as parton-induced interactions and collective effects developing in a high-density system possibly formed in these collisions. In order to understand the nature of this doubleridge structure the two-particle correlation analysis has been extended to identified particles. The observed mass dependence in p-Pb resembles the pattern observed in Pb-Pb collisions and is compatible with expectations from hydrodynamics. The subtraction of the long-range structures allows the study of the hadron production belonging to the fragmentation of jets originating from low momentum-transfer scatterings (minijets).",

            "text": "The study of particle correlations is a powerful tool to probe the mechanism of particle production in collisions of hadrons and nuclei at high beam energy. The correlation of particles is measured in relative angles \u2206\u03d5 and \u2206\u03b7, where \u2206\u03d5 and \u2206\u03b7 are the differences in azimuthal angle \u03d5 and pseudorapidity \u03b7 between two particles. The observation of the ridge structures in high-multiplicity events on the near (\u2206\u03d5 \u2248 0) and away side (\u2206\u03d5 \u2248 \u03c0) of the trigger particle, extending over a long-range in \u2206\u03b7 is one of the unexpected observations of the p-Pb run at the LHC [1,2,3]. The excellent particle identification capability of the ALICE detector [4] allows to further characterise the system created in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions in order to understand the origin of this effect. Multi-particle correlations are also studied to further reduce the contribution mainly originating from the fragmentation of hard partons. After subtraction of the long-range structures the hadron production belonging to the fragmentation of jets originating from low momentum-transfer scatterings (minijets) can be studied.",

Particles are identified by means of the specific energy loss in the gas of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the arrival time in the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector. Assuming the lowmultiplicity class to be dominated by correlations from fragmentation of hard partons, it is possible to reduce the jet contribution by subtracting the correlation function of the low-multiplicity class from the high-multiplicity class. This procedure was applied for the first time in Ref. [3] and widely used to study the p-Pb system, where no significant evidence of energy loss of partons in the medium is observed [6].",

The crossing occurs at p T \u2248 2 GeV/c. The coefficient v K 2 is consistent with v \u03c0 2 above 1 GeV/c; below 1 GeV/c there is a hint that v K 2 is lower than v \u03c0 2 . The mass ordering and crossing is a particularly interesting observation because it is qualitatively similar to observations in nucleus-nucleus collisions [7]. This pattern is in agreement with the expectations from hydrodynamic models in p-Pb [8,9].  The analysis of multi-particle cumulants shows that the v 2 coefficient has a finite value when calculated with two-and four-particle cumulants.

The uncorrelated seeds exhibit a linear increase with N Ch in particular at high multiplicity in p-Pb collisions. To quantify this behaviour, a linear fit is performed in the 0-50% multiplicity class and the ratio to the data is presented in the bottom panel. The linear description extends over a wide range (N Ch 20), with a departure from linear behaviour observed at low multiplicity. This observation suggests that there is no evidence of a saturation in the number of multiple parton interactions in high-multiplicity p-Pb[13], compared to pp where it deviates from the linear dependence at large N Ch values [12].",

The v 2 coefficient extracted from two-particle correlations shows a mass ordering that is reminiscent of the observations in Pb-Pb collisions, where a collective behaviour of the system is established. The analysis of multi-particle  correlations suggests that the double ridge in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions arises from a correlations among many particles. A further hint of similarity between the two systems is found when looking at the multiplicity dependence of the particle ratios and <p T >. The study of the minijet production in p-Pb indicates that events in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions can be modelled as an incoherent fragmentation of multiple parton-parton scatterings. Future studies of two-particle correlations with very large separation in pseudorapidity in p-Pb will give the opportunity to further probe the low-x regime where saturation effects are expected to be stronger and to study the presence of the same effect in smaller systems, such as pp.",
