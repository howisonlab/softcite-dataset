Zou 1  A search for radiative decays of the P -wave spin singlet charmonium resonance hc is performed based on 4.48 \u00d7 10 8 \u03c8 \u2032 events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. Events of the reaction channels hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b3\u03b7 are observed with a statistical significance of 8.4\u03c3 and 4.0\u03c3, respectively, for the first time. The branching fractions of hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 and hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 are measured to be B(hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) = (1.52 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b1 0.29) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and B(hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7) = (4.7 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively, where the first errors are statistical and the second are systematic uncertainties. Charmonium, the bound state of a charmed quark and anticharmed quark (cc), has played an important role for our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the fundamental theory that describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons. At low energies, QCD remains of high interest both experimentally and theoretically. All charmonium states below the open-charm DD threshold have been observed experimentally and can be well described by potential models [1]. However, knowledge is still sparse on the Pwave spin-singlet state, h c ( 1 P 1 ). So far, only a few decay modes of h c have been observed, in particular, the radiative transition h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (with a branching fraction B \u2248 50%) [2] and one hadronic decay h c \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 0 (B \u2248 2%) [3]. Searches for the new h c decay modes, such as h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ), are useful for providing constraints to theoretical models in the charmonium region. The ratio of the branching fraction B(h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7) over B(h c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) can also be used to study the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle [4], which is important to test SU(3)-flavor symmetries in QCD.",

The study with the \u03c8 \u2032 inclusive MC sample shows that the main background processes are \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8(\u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) and \u03c9(\u03b3\u03c0 0 )\u03b7 \u2032 for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 decay mode; \u03c9(\u03b3\u03c0 0 )\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b3\u03c7 c0 (\u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 ) for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode; and \u03b3\u03c7 c2 (\u03b7\u03b7) for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay modes. None of the background channels shows a peaking behaviour in the signal region, and their overall contribution is found to be smooth. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the invariant masses M (\u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) and M (\u03b3\u03b7) for the selected events. Signals of the h c meson are observed. In order to extract the signal yield a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit is performed  ",

The uncertainty due to the fit range is obtained by varying the limits of the fit range by \u00b10.01 GeV/c 2 , and the change in the final result is taken as the uncertainty. The uncertainty due to the signal shape is derived from the difference in the mass resolution between data and MC simulation, and from the errors of the h c resonance parameters. To study the differences in the mass resolution between data and MC simulation the J/\u03c8 distribution of the reaction \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) is fitted with the MC shape of the J/\u03c8 convoluted with a Gaussian function. The parameters (mean m and sigma \u03c3) of the Gaussian function are determined to be m = 0.1 \u00b1 0.1MeV, \u03c3 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.3MeV for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, and m = 0.0 \u00b1 0.2MeV, \u03c3 = 0.1 \u00b1 0.4MeV for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , so the difference between data and MC simulation is small. To be conservative, we construct Gaussian smearing functions with the above measured mean and sigma varied by \u00b11\u03c3, and convolve the MC-determined h c shape with them and refit the data. We take the largest difference as the systematic uncertainty. To consider the uncertainties of the h c resonance parameters, the MC-determined shape convolved by a Gaussian with the mean and sigma given by the errors of the h c parameters [12], is used as the signal shape for a refit of the data, and the difference is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. These two systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature, assuming they are independent, to obtain the systematic uncertainty on the signal shape. The uncertainty caused by the background shape is estimated by changing the background shape from an ARGUS function to a linear function. The difference between the two methods is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the background shape. Table II summarizes all the systematic uncertainties of the different decay modes. The overall systematic errors are obtained by adding all systematic uncertainties in quadrature by assuming they are independent.",
