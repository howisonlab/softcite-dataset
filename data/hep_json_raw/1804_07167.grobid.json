An excess is found over the background-only hypothesis with a significance of 3.4 standard deviations. The branching fraction of the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is determined to be B(B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = [2.9 \u00b1 1.0 (stat) \u00b1 0.2 (syst) \u00b1 0.3 (norm)] \u00d7 10 \u22128 , where the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. The third uncertainty is due to limited knowledge of external parameters used to normalise the branching fraction measurement.",

The leading contributions to the amplitude of the decay correspond to loop Feynman diagrams and involve the offdiagonal element V td of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix. This process is consequently rare in the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). New particles predicted by extensions of the SM can enter in competing diagrams and can significantly enhance or suppress the rate of the decay, see for example refs. [1,2]. Formfactor computations for the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 transition have been made using light-cone sum rule [3,4] and lattice QCD [5] techniques. Standard Model predictions for the branching fraction of the decay are in the range 3-4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 [6][7][8].",

[9] and [10], respectively. Evidence for the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has also been established in ref. [11]. The decay B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has not yet been observed. The measured ratio of the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fractions has also been used to determine the ratio of CKM elements |V td /V ts | [12], exploiting correlations between the B \u2192 K and B \u2192 \u03c0 form-factors in lattice computations. A similar approach could, in the future, be applied to the ratio of the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay rates [13]. The decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , which involves a b \u2192 s + \u2212 transition, has been studied extensively by BaBar, Belle, CDF and by the LHC experiments [14][15][16][17][18][19]. The rate of the JHEP07(2018)020 decay appears to be systematically lower than current SM predictions. Global analyses of b \u2192 s processes favour a modification of the SM at the level of 4 to 5 standard deviations [20][21][22][23][24]. Similar studies of b \u2192 d processes are important to understand the flavour structure of the underlying theory.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a siliconstrip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [27], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [28] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [29]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillatingpad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [30].",

The shape of this background is taken from the simulation.

The decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 forms a source of background if the final-state hadrons are misidentified. This background is constrained from a control region in the data, by modifying the PID requirements on the candidates to preferentially select pK \u2212 rather than K \u2212 \u03c0 + combinations. The shape of this background is modelled in the fit by Crystal Ball functions.

The background contribution from B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays is determined from a control region in the data, by selecting candidates with a K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass that is consistent with the known B \u2212 mass. This background is only visible for the candidates with q 2 in the J/\u03c8 mass region. The shape of the background in the fit is modelled by Crystal Ball functions.

The background from semileptonic decays is predominantly reconstructed at low m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and does not contribute to the analysis. Fully hadronic b-hadron decays contribute at the level of 1 to 2 candidates at masses close to the known B 0 s mass.

Summing over the bins of neural network response and data-taking periods, the yields are: 627 244 \u00b1 837 for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decay, 5730 \u00b1 94 for the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decay, 4157 \u00b1 72 for the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, and 38 \u00b1 12 for the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay. No correction has been made to these yields to account for cases where the K \u2212 \u03c0 + system does not originate from a K * (892) 0 decay. Contamination from non-K * 0 decays is discussed further in section 5. Using Wilks' theorem, and a likelihood ratio test between the signal-plus-background and the background-only hypothesis, the significance of the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 yield is determined to be \u22122 log(L S+B /L B ) = 3.4 standard deviations. The signal significance has been validated using pseudoexperiments generated under the null hypothesis. This includes the systematic uncertainties on the yield discussed in section 6.   -7 -JHEP07(2018)020",

Consequently, many potential sources of systematic uncertainty largely cancel in the ratios. The remaining sources of systematic uncertainty are discussed below and are summarised in table 1. Only systematic uncertainties that have an effect on the measured yield are considered when evaluating the significance of the observed signal. These are systematic uncertainties related to the signal resolution, neural network binning scheme and the residual backgrounds at m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) close to the known B 0 s meson mass. The m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) model used to describe the decays B 0 and B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is taken from the simulation with a simple scaling of the width and tail parameters based on the fit to the data in the J/\u03c8 mass region. Any difference in the q 2 spectrum of the simulation and the data could result in a small mismodelling of the lineshape. To account for this possibility, the width of the m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) resolution model is allowed to vary within 0.5 MeV/c 2 in the fit. This covers the full variation in the simulation of the width across the allowed q 2 range and contributes 0.1% to the systematic uncertainty. A final uncertainty on the signal lineshape is evaluated based on the difference in fits to the candidates in the J/\u03c8 mass region with and without the constraint on the dimuon mass. A systematic uncertainty of 0.5% is assigned, taken as the difference in efficiency-corrected B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 yields between these two fits. In addition, an alternative parameterisation with an exponential tail rather than a power-law tail is tested for the lineshape describing the \u039b 0 b background. The difference in yields between the two models results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1% on the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 yield.

The uncertainty on the decay structure leads to an uncertainty on the efficiencies used to correct the observed yields. The amplitude structure of the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay has been studied in refs. [44,48], and the amplitude structure of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay in ref.

The full angular distribution of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has been studied by the LHCb collaboration in ref. [19]. The decay structure of the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is, however, unknown. To determine a systematic uncertainty associated to the knowledge of these decay models, the simulated samples are weighted such that the coupling strengths used in the model are consistent with the results from global fits to b \u2192 s data [20][21][22][23][24]. Again, the systematic uncertainty is assigned as the difference of \u03b5 with and without the weighting.

Finally, the contribution from non-K * 0 states in the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is also considered. This contribution is also unknown and is assumed to be at a similar level as seen in the decay B 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [19].

These uncertainties comprise a statistical component due to the limited size of the simulated samples and a systematic component associated to the choice of binning in kinematic variables used to evaluate PID and track reconstruction efficiencies. A separate systematic uncertainty is also considered on the ratio of efficiencies due to data-simulation differences. This systematic uncertainty is evaluated by taking the deviation between the efficiency ratio with and without corrections described in section 2 applied. This includes corrections to the B 0 (s) meson kinematics, PID performance and track reconstruction efficiency. This results in an additional uncertainty of 1 to 2% depending on the measurement considered.",
