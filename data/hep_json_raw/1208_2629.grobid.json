            "text": "Neutrino time of flight measurements were triggered by the OPERA Collaboration announcement [1] of the surprising result indicating a superluminal propagation speed of CNGS neutrinos from CERN to LNGS. Cohen and Glashow [2] argued that such superluminal neutrinos should lose energy by producing photons and e + e \u2212 pairs, through Z 0 mediated processes, analogous to Cherenkov radiation. The ICARUS Collaboration reported a negative result in the search for superluminal Cherenkov-like pairs inside its large LAr-TPC detector [3] exposed to the CNGS beam. No candidate event was found, setting a tight negative limit on (v \u03bd \u2212c)/c of 2.5\u00d710 \u22128 at 90 % C.L. Moreover the ICARUS Collaboration performed a first time of flight measurement of neutrinos from CERN to LNGS with a 3 ns wide bunched beam shortly operated at the end of 2011 CNGS run. The result, \u03b4t = tof c \u2212 tof \u03bd = 0.3 \u00b1 4.9 stat. \u00b1 9.0 syst. ns [4] was compatible with the simultaneous arrival of all events with speed equal to that of light, in a striking difference with the reported initial result of OPERA [1].",

In addition to it, a new independent system for timing distribution was deployed both at CERN and at LNGS. It is based on a recent, still under development, open source protocol, called \"White Rabbit\" (WR) [13], whose main purpose is to constantly and accurately monitor the propagation delay of any signal along the optical path, connecting all Nodes (PC's provided with WR hardware interface and running the WR protocol firmware) of the WR system. The WR system is expected to intrinsically correct for any change of the propagation chain delay, thus avoiding the need of periodic calibrations of the optical fibres described in the previous section. Any Node participating in the WR system is thus phase-locked with all the others, with accuracy and stability much better than one ns. The WR protocol allows the distribution of timing signals at various frequencies (e.g. PPS, PPmS) as well as the time-stamping of any pulse generated by the DAQ systems connected to WR Nodes.",

Each module houses two TPCs separated by a common cathode. A uniform electric field (E drift = 500 V/cm) is applied.

The final timing is obtained as weighted average of the HPTF timing with that obtained with the alternative paths. The overall systematic error derived within the averaging procedure is \u223c 2.39 ns.
