Newly proposed experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron Collider running or after the end of the Tevatron Collider program. For example, the annihilation of 5 to 8 GeV antiprotons is expected to yield world-leading sensitivities to hyperon rare decays and CP violation. It could also provide the world's most intense source of tagged D 0 mesons, and thus the best near-term opportunity to study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search for new physics. Other measurements that could be made include properties of the X(3872) and the charmonium system. An experiment using a Penning trap and an atom interferometer could make the world's most precise measurement of the gravitational force on antimatter. These and other potential measurements using antiprotons offer a great opportunity for a broad and exciting physics program at Fermilab in the post-Tevatron era.",

After Tevatron running ends, an internal target could be operated in The number of operating hours at FAIR reflects sharing of the collection ring between the antiproton and radioactive-beam programs. With the staged FAIR construction plan, antiproton stacking will occur in the experiment ring, leading to a small stacking duty factor, as indicated here, until the stacking ring is built. [3] * Once they are taken into account, large final-state interactions are expected to increase this prediction to a range comparable to that for \u2126 \u2192 \u039bK [7].",

            "text": "Using the Fermilab Antiproton Source, experiments E760 and E835 made the world's most precise measurements of charmonium masses and widths [19,20]. This (< 100 keV) precision was enabled by the small energy spread of the stochastically cooled antiproton beam and the absence of Fermi motion and negligible energy loss in the H 2 cluster-jet target. Although charmonium has by now been extensively studied, a number of questions remain in this region, most notably the nature of the mysterious X(3872) state [21] and improved measurement of h c and \u03b7 c parameters [22]. The width of the X may well be small compared to 1 MeV [18]. The unique precision of the pp energy-scan technique is ideally suited to making the precise mass, lineshape, and width measurements needed to test the intriguing hypothesis that the X(3872) is a D * 0 D 0 molecule [23]. As shown in Fig. 1, in the molecular hypothesis, the lineshape of the X(3872) will be distinctive and will depend on decay mode. For optimal \u221a s resolution, these measurements will require the use of a hydrogen target: either an improved version of the E835 gas jet or a windowless, frozenhydrogen target [24,25] (see below). The formation cross section of X(3872) in pp annihilation has not been measured, but it has been estimated to be similar in magnitude to that of the \u03c7 c states [26,27]. By extrapolation from E760, about 500 events would be observed in the X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 mode per day at the peak of the X(3872). Given the uncertainties in the cross section and branching ratios, this may well be an under-or overestimate of the pp formation and observation rates, perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, it appears that a new experiment at the Antiproton Accumulator could obtain the world's largest clean samples of X(3872), in perhaps as little as a month of running. 1 In a few months of running, hundreds to thousands of observed events can be expected in all of the known decay modes, and many more, as-yet-unknown, modes should be seen as well. We will also have the opportunity to study the angular distributions of both the known and unknown modes. The high statistics, event cleanliness, and unique precision available in the pp formation technique could enable the world's smallest systematics. This experiment could thus provide a definitive test of the nature of the X(3872).",

            "text": "While the total charm-production cross section for \u2248 8 GeV antiprotons incident on proton or nucleon targets is challenging to compute from first principles, recent phenomenological estimates imply values in the 1-10 \u00b5b range [27,33,34,35,36,37]. This is sufficiently large that the experiment we propose could amass a sample ten or more times larger than those of the B factories, years before the super-B factories reach comparable sensitivities. For example, model calculations of the exclusive cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 D * 0 D 0 ) peak at about 1 \u00b5b at \u221a s \u2248 4.2 GeV [35,36,37]. This corresponds to antiprotons of 8 GeV kinetic energy (the Antiproton Source design energy) impinging on a fixed target and, at L = 2 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , represents some 4 \u00d7 10 9 events produced per year. Since there will also be D * \u00b1 D \u2213 , D * D * , DD, DD\u03c0,... events, the total charm sample will be yet larger, and with the use of a target nucleus heavier than hydrogen, the charm-production A-dependence [38,39] should enhance statistics by a further factor of a few. The total sample could thus substantially exceed the 10 9 events now available at the B factories. Indeed, we project in Table 4 in excess of 10 10 tagged-D 0 events produced per year of running. By localizing the primary interactions to \u223c 10 \u00b5m along the beam direction, a thin wire or frozen-hydrogen target can allow the D decay to be resolved. The low charged multiplicity at these energies [40] implies small combinatorial background, so that clean samples can be amassed using only modest vertex cuts, and thus, with high efficiency. Medium-energy pp or pN annihilation may thus be the optimal way to study charm mixing, and to search for possible new-physics contributions via the clean signature [31,41,42] of charm CPV.",

Table 4 gives an example sensitivity calculation in D * -tagged D 0 \u2192 K\u03c0 decays. Our sensitivity in semileptonic decays will depend on the efficiency and purity of lepton identification, which we have not yet simulated. In hadronic modes, we could be the world's most sensitive experiment, exceeding current B-factory statistics by a factor of 10 or more, and perhaps in semileptonic modes as well. Depending on their trigger and reconstruction efficiencies for charm, LHCb may achieve statistical sensitivities comparable to or exceeding ours, but we expect them to have appreciable systematic uncertainties for small ( < \u223c 10 \u22123 ) charm CPV asymmetries. We will also have biases to correct, but ours will differ from theirs in important ways (CP-symmetric initial state, no B background, much lower charged multiplicities). It will be crucial to have independent corroborating evidence for these subtle measurements, such as we and LHCb can provide.",

Augmented with a small, high-rate TPC, new, thin, fine-pitch scintillating-fiber planes, and picosecond time-of-flight detectors currently under development [46], these can form a very powerful general-purpose spectrometer ( Fig. 3) for the low-multiplicity hadronic events that are produced by pp or pN annihilation in this energy range.",

Thin metal wire targets can serve to localize the production vertex, thereby facilitating charm-event identification via decay-vertex reconstruction. However, some of the proposed  physics topics benefit from the elimination of Fermi motion and minimal beam energy loss provided by a hydrogen target. In particular, scanning of the beam energy across the resonance for precision determination of charmonium and X(3872) masses and widths requires a hydrogen target. This can be accommodated by use of a windowless frozen target [24], based on successful experience with previous designs [25]. Further details of the proposed TAPAS experiment may be found in the proposal [48].",
