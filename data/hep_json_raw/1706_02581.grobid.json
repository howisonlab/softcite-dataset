The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. No deviations are observed with respect to standard model predictions. The results are used in the first interpretation of dark matter production in tt and bb final states in a simplified model. This analysis is also the first to perform a statistical combination of searches for dark matter produced with different heavy-flavor final states. The combination provides exclusions that are stronger than those achieved with individual heavy-flavor final states.",

            "text": "Astrophysical and cosmological observations [1][2][3] provide strong support for the existence of dark matter (DM), which could originate from physics beyond the standard model (BSM). In a large class of BSM models, DM consists of stable, weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In collider experiments, WIMPs (\u03c7 ) could be pair-produced through the exchange of new mediating fields that couple to DM and to standard model (SM) particles. Following their production, the WIMPs would escape detection, thereby creating an imbalance of transverse momentum (missing transverse momentum, p miss T ) in the event. If the new physics associated with DM respects the principle of minimal flavor violation [4,5], the interactions of spin-0 mediators retain the Yukawa structure of the SM. This principle is motivated by the apparent lack of new flavor physics at the electroweak (EWK) scale. Because only the top quark has a Yukawa coupling of order unity, WIMP DM couples preferentially to the heavy top quark in models with minimal flavor violation. In high energy proton-proton collisions, this e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch coupling leads to the production of tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 at lowest-order via a scalar (\u03c6) or pseudoscalar (a) mediator (Fig. 1), and to the production of so-called mono-X final states through a top quark loop [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 process can be probed directly via the tt + p miss T and bb + p miss T signatures. The bb + p miss T signature provides additional sensitivity to the bb+\u03c7 \u03c7 process for models in which mediator couplings to up-type quarks are suppressed, as can be the case in Type-II two Higgs doublet models [15].",

A potential DM signal is extracted from simultaneous fits to the p miss T distributions in the bb + p miss T and tt + p miss T search channels. Data from control regions enriched in SM tt, W + jets, and Z + jets processes are included in the fits, to constrain the major backgrounds. The top quark nearly always decays to a W boson and a b quark. The W boson subsequently decays leptonically (to charged leptons and neutrinos) or hadronically (to quark pairs). The dileptonic, lepton( )+jets, and all-hadronic tt final states consist, respectively, of events in which both, either, or neither of the W bosons decay leptonically. Each of these primary tt final states are explored.",

            "text": "Previous LHC searches for DM produced with heavyflavor quark pairs were interpreted using effective field theories that parameterize the DM-SM coupling in terms of an interaction scale M * [16][17][18]. An earlier search by the CMS Collaboration investigated the + jets tt final state using 19.7 fb \u22121 of data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [19]. That search excluded values of M * below 118 GeV, assuming m \u03c7 = 100 GeV. The ATLAS Collaboration performed a similar search separately for the all-hadronic and + jets tt final states and obtained comparable limits on M * [20]. More recently, the limitations of effective field theory interpretations of DM production at the LHC has led to the development of simplified models that remain valid when the mediating particle is produced on-shell [21]. This analysis adopts the simplified model framework to provide the first interpreta- tion of heavy-flavor search results in terms of the decays of spin-0 mediators with scalar or pseudoscalar couplings. This paper also reports the first statistical combination of dileptonic (ee, e\u03bc, \u03bc\u03bc), + jets (e, \u03bc), and all-hadronic tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 searches, as well as the first combination of tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 and bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 search results.",

The energy of the ECAL clusters is required to be compatible with the momentum of the associated electron track. Muon candidates are reconstructed by combining tracks from the inner silicon tracker and the outer muon system [33]. Tracks associated with muon candidates must be consistent with a muon originating from the primary vertex, and must satisfy a set of quality criteria [33]. Electrons and muons are selected with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1 for consistency with the coverage of the single-lepton triggers, and are required to be isolated from hadronic activity, to reject hadrons misidentified as leptons. Relative isolation is defined as the scalar p T sum of PF candidates within a R = \u221a \u03b7 2 + \u03c6 2 cone of radius 0.4 or 0.3 centered on electrons or muons, respectively, divided by the lepton p T . Relative isolation is nominally required to be less than 0.035 (0.065) for electrons in the barrel (endcap), respectively, and less than 0.15 for muons. Identification requirements, based on hit information in the tracker and muon systems, and on energy depositions in the calorimeters, are imposed to ensure that candidate leptons are well-measured. These restrictive isolation and identification criteria are used to select events from the dileptonic tt, + jets tt, W( \u03bd) + jets, and Z ( ) + jets processes. The efficiencies of the requirements for electrons (muons) with p T > 30 GeV range from 52 to 83% (91 to 96%), for increasing lepton p T . Less restrictive lepton isolation and identification requirements are used to reject events containing additional leptons with p T > 10 GeV. Efficiencies for these requirements range from 66 to 96% for electrons and 73 to 99% for muons, for increasing lepton p T . Electron and muon selection efficiency scale factors are applied in simulation to match the efficiencies measured in data using the tagand-probe procedure [34].

The DM particles \u03c7 are assumed to be Dirac fermions, and the mediators are spin-0 particles with scalar (\u03c6) or pseudoscalar (a) couplings. The coupling strength of the mediator to SM fermions is assumed to be g qq = g q y q where: y q = \u221a 2m q /v is the SM Yukawa coupling, m q is the quark mass, and v = 246 GeV is the Higgs field vacuum expectation value. As per the recommendations of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group [47], g q is taken to be flavor universal and equal to 1. Likewise, the coupling strength of the mediator to DM, g \u03c7 , is set to 1 and is independent of the DM mass. The LHC DMF spin-0 models do not account for mixing between the \u03c6 scalar and the SM Higgs boson [48]. As is discussed in [21], the p miss T spectra of both the scalar and pseudoscalar mediated processes broaden with increasing mediator mass. For m \u03c6/a larger than twice the top quark mass (m top ), the p miss T distributions of the scalar and pseudoscalar processes are essentially identical. As m \u03c6/a decreases below 2m top , the p miss T spectra of the two processes increasingly differ, with the distribution of the scalar process peaking at lower p miss T values [49,50]. For all mediator masses, the total cross section of the scalar process is larger than that of the pseudoscalar equivalent [50]. This analysis focuses on the m \u03c7 = 1 GeV LHC DMF benchmark point, which provides a convenient signal reference for both low and high mass mediators.",

These trigger selections are more than 90% efficient for PF-reconstructed electrons and muons that satisfy the p T , identification, and isolation requirements imposed. T . Additional selections, described in Sect. 4.1 and summarized in Table 1, are applied to define eight independent regions of data that are sensitive to DM signals: two bb + p miss T , one + jets tt + p miss T , three dileptonic tt + p miss T , and two all-hadronic tt + p miss T regions. Control regions (CRs) enriched in various background processes are also defined and are used to improve background estimates in the aforementioned signal regions (SRs). In the CRs, individual signal selection requirements are inverted to enhance background yields and to prevent event overlaps with the SRs. Collectively, the SRs and CRs associated with the individual tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 and bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 production and decay modes are referred to as \"channels\". The bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 channel and the three tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 channels are used in simultaneous p miss T fits (described in Sect. 5) to extract a potential DM signal. The fits allow the background-enriched CRs to constrain the contributions of SM tt, W + jets, and Z + jets processes within the CRs and SRs of each channel. The selections used to define the SRs and CRs are described in Sects. 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Tables 1 and 2 briefly summarize these selections.

Clearly, the dominant backgrounds in the SRs are from the SM tt, W + jets, and Z + jets processes. The estimation of backgrounds in the SRs is improved through the use of corresponding data CRs enriched in these processes. Independent CRs are defined for each of the + jets tt + p miss T , all-hadronic tt + p miss T and bb + p miss T SRs. In some cases, multiple CRs are used to constrain a given background process in a SR. In this section we describe the main tt, W + jets, and Z + jets backgrounds and the selections used to define the CRs. The CR selections are designed to ensure that these regions are both mutually exclusive and exclusive of the SRs as well. The contributions of multijet, diboson, single t, and tt + Z /W/\u03b3 processes in the SRs are either subdominant or insignificant after the SR selections. The residual backgrounds from these processes are modeled with simulation. Dilepton background events from Drell-Yan and processes in which jets are misidentified as leptons are estimated using the sideband techniques described in Ref. [58].

Normalization differences in the range of 0.2-1.4% result from reweighting the simulation accordingly. -W/Z + heavy-flavor fraction The uncertainty in the fraction of W/Z + heavy-flavor jets is assigned to account for the usage of CRs dominated by light-flavor jets in constraining the prediction of W + jets and Z + jets in SRs that require b tags.

The uncertainties per channel are 200% (ee), 48% (e\u03bc), 30% (\u03bc\u03bc), and are dominated by the statistical uncertainty associated with the singlelepton control sample. Because the misidentified lepton background is small, these relatively large uncertainties do not significantly degrade the sensitivity of the search. -RTT efficiency Jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties are propagated to the RTT efficiency scale factors by using modified shape templates in the efficiency extraction fit. A systematic uncertainty due to the choice of parton showering scheme is estimated by comparing the efficiencies obtained with default and alternative p miss T templates. The default simulation is showered using Pythia8.205, which implements dipole-based parton showering. The alternative templates are derived from simulated events that are showered with Herwig [66], which uses an angular-ordered shower model. Overall, statistical plus systematic uncertainties of 6, 3, and 3% are assigned for the hadronic tag, hadronic mistag, and nonhadronic mistag scale factors, respectively.

Jet energy scale uncertainties are coherently propagated to all observables including p miss T . -Top quark p T reweighting Differential measurements of top quark pair production show that the measured p T spectrum of top quarks is softer than that of simulation. Scale factors to cover this effect have been derived in previous CMS measurements [68] and are applied to all simulated SM tt samples by default. The uncertainty in the top quark p T spectrum is estimated from a comparison with the spectrum obtained without reweighting. -Higher-order QCD corrections The uncertainties due to missing higher-order QCD corrections in the LO samples are estimated by generating alternative event samples in which the factorization and renormalization scale parameters (\u03bc F , \u03bc R ) are simultaneously increased or decreased by a factor of two. These uncertainties are correlated across the bins of the p miss T distribution. Uncertainties in the NLO K-factors applied to W + jets and Z + jets simulation are determined by recalculating the K-factor with \u03bc F and \u03bc R independently varied by a factor of two up or down.",

Pseudodata are generated from the fitted MC yields to determine the distribution of the likelihood ratio. The p-values obtained are larger than 0.5 for each channel except for the all-hadronic tt + p miss T channel, for which a low p-value of 0.01 is determined. This value appears to result from the scatter in the 0,1 RTT CRs. No significant excess in the individual search channels is observed.",

The analysis explores bb + p miss T and the dileptonic, +jets, and all-hadronic tt + p miss T final states. A resolved top quark tagger is used to categorize events in the all-hadronic channel. No significant deviation from the standard model background prediction is observed. Results are interpreted in terms of dark matter (DM) production, and constraints are placed on the parameter space of simplified models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators. The DM search channels are considered both individually and, for the first time, in combination. The combined search excludes production cross sections larger than 1.5 or 1.8 times the values predicted for a 10 GeV scalar mediator or a 10 GeV pseudoscalar mediator, respectively, for couplings of g q = g \u03c7 = 1.

Multijet background is suppressed by requiring that min \u03c6( \u2212 \u2192 p jet i T , \u2212 \u2192 p miss T ) > 0.4 or 1 radian (depending on the number of RTT tags, as described below) for all jets in the event. The min \u03c6( \u2212 \u2192 p jet i T , \u2212 \u2192 p miss T ) selections also help to reduce + jets tt background, for which the p miss T vector is typically aligned with a b jet.",

The shape of the observed p miss T distribution provides additional information that is used in this analysis to improve the sensitivity of the search. A potential signal is searched for via simultaneous template fits to the p miss T distributions in the SRs and the associated CRs defined in Sects. 4.1 and 4.2.

These nuisance parameters allow the data in the background-enriched CRs to constrain the background estimates in the SRs to which they correspond. Because separate nuisance parameters are used for each search channel, a given normalization parameter cannot affect background predictions in unassociated search channels. The yields andp miss T shapes of subdominant backgrounds vary in the fit only through the constrained nuisance parameters. Signal yields in the SRs and associated CRs are scaled simultaneously by signal strength parameters (\u03bc), defined as the ratio of the signal cross section to the theoretical cross section, \u03bc = \u03c3/\u03c3 TH . The \u03bc parameters scale signal normalization coherently across regions, and thus account for signal contamination in the CRs. Signal extraction is performed for the individual search channels as well as for their combination. The separate fits to the individual signal and associated CRs provide independent estimates of bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 and tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 contributions in each channel. In this fitting scenario, separate signal strength parameters are used for each of the search channels. The bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 process is considered as a potential signal in the 1 b tag and 2 b tag regions of the bb + p miss T channel. The tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 process is searched for in all SRs of the bb + p miss T and tt + p miss T channels separately. The contribution of the bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 process in the all-hadronic tt + p miss T channel is negligible due to the jet multiplicity requirement. An inclusive fit to all signal and CRs is also performed. This fit uses a single signal strength parameter to extract the combined contribution of tt + \u03c7 \u03c7 and bb + \u03c7 \u03c7 in data.
