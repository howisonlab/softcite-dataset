The system observed in \u221a s NN = 0.2 TeV Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was found to behave as a perfect fluid which is initially close to the ideal hydrodynamic limit [1][2][3][4]. The main features of this new form of matter are the strong flow (radial and anisotropic) and the opacity to jets. The strongly coupled QGP has been confirmed and studied by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [5], where Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV have been achieved [6].",

The minimum bias (MB) trigger signal was provided by the V0 counters, two arrays of 32 scintillator tiles each covering the full azimuth within 2.8< \u03b7 lab <5.1 (V0A, Pb beam direction) and -3.7< \u03b7 lab <-1.7 (V0C, p beam direction). The signal amplitude and arrival time collected in each tile were recorded. A coincidence of signals in both V0A and V0C detectors was required to remove contributions from single diffractive and electromagnetic events. For p-Pb collisions, the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system has a rapidity of y NN =-0.465 in the direction of the proton beam. Therefore, to ensure good detector acceptance, identified particle measurements shown in this paper are performed within -0.5< y CMS <0.0 in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system, unless specified otherwise. Particle production is studied in seven event classes being defined based on the total charge deposited in the V0A detector [8]. It is worth noting that in p-Pb the correlation of geometry and multiplicity is much weaker than in Pb-Pb and hence the event classes are not denoted as centrality classes in this work.",

Hadrons at low momenta (from \u2248100-300 MeV/c up to \u22482-3 GeV/c) can be identified track-by-track using different detectors. The specific energy loss (dE/dx) in gas and in silicon is measured in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Inner Tracking System (ITS), respectively. The TOF detector allows for particle identification measuring the particle velocity with the Time-Of-Flight technique. At higher p T (>2-3 GeV/c up to 20 GeV/c), PID is done measuring the TPC-dE/dx in the relativistic rise regime of the Bethe-Bloch curve, where the TPC-dE/dx separation between particles with different masses is constant at large momenta [17]. At intermediate p T (2< p T <6 GeV/c) the PID is improved using a High Momentum Cherenkov PID detector (HMPID). K * 0 and \u03c6 signals are reconstructed following the techniques which are described in [18,19]. For each event, the invariant-mass distribution of the K * 0 and \u03c6 is constructed using all unlike-sign combinations of charged kaon candidates with charged pion and kaon candidates, respectively. Daughter tracks are identified using the TPC and TOF detectors. The K 0 S and \u039b particles are identified by reconstructing the weak decay topology in the channels K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b(\u039b) \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 (p\u03c0 + ).

At low p T (< 2-3 GeV/c) the spectra exhibit a hardening with increasing multiplicity, with this effect being more pronounced for heavy particles. We are therefore observing features which resemble the radial flow effects well know from heavy-ion collisions [17] and which are well described when a hydrodynamical evolution of the system is considered. In [8] it was shown that for high multiplicity p-Pb events, the p T spectra were described by the blast-wave function which is a simplified hydrodynamical evolution model. Using the parameters obtained from the simultaneous fit to pion, kaon, proton and lambda p T spectra the model is able to describe the multi-strange baryon p T distributions (p T <4 GeV/c) as shown in Fig. 1. The feature is also observed in Pythia 8 tune 4C [11,20], where no hydrodynamical evolution is modeled. To compare the different colliding systems (pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions), the right hand side of Fig. 1 shows the average p T as a function of dN ch /\u03b7 |\u03b7|<0.5 for charged pions, kaons and (anti)protons. The V0A detector is also used to classify the pp collisions according with their multiplicity. For small systems, the average p T exhibits a steeper rise with increasing multiplicity than that for Pb-Pb collisions. It is also observed that p T increases faster with multiplicity for heavier hadrons than for lighter ones. Additionally, it has been pointed out that the average p T shows an explicit dependence with the number of constituent quarks in: 1) MB pp collisions at different \u221a s, 2) the different multiplicity classes reported for p-Pb collisions and 3) for peripheral Pb-Pb collisions (60-90%). This feature has been attributed to fragmentation [21] and is not present in the hydrodynamical calculations [22].    The nuclear modification factor, R pPb , is measured in order to study particle species dependence of the nuclear matter effects. R pPb is defined as:  Fig. 2 shows the identified hadron R pPb in NSD p-Pb events. At high p T (>10 GeV/c), all nuclear modification factors are consistent with unity within systematic and statistical uncertainties. Around 4 GeV/c, the unidentified charged hadron R pPb is slightly above unity [24], such a enhancement is \u22483 times smaller than that observed for the (anti)proton R pPb . For charged pions and kaons the enhancement is below that of charged particles. This suggests that the barely significant Cronin enhancement observed for inclusive charged particles can be explained as due to the multiplicity evolution of the (anti)proton spectral shape.",

The p-Pb results are compared to analogous measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [18] and Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [19]. In heavy-ion collisions the decreasing trend of K * 0 /K with increasing fireball size has been explained as a consequence of a rescattering of K * 0 decay daughters in the hadronic phase. It is worth noticing that a similar trend is also observed in p-Pb collisions. ",
