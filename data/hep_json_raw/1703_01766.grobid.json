While precision tests comparing processes involving electrons and muons have not revealed any definite violation of this assumption, recent studies involving the higher-mass tau lepton have resulted in observations that challenge lepton universality at the level of four standard deviations. A confirmation of these results would point to new particles or interactions, and could have profound implications for our understanding of particle physics.",

Based on information extracted from experiments, theorists have combined the theory of electroweak (EW) interactions with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, and experiments have validated this theory to an extraordinary degree. Any observation that is proven to be inconsistent with SM assumptions would suggest a new type of interaction or particle.",

The electron, a critical component of matter, was discovered by J.J. Thomson [3] in 1897. The discovery of the muon in cosmic rays by C. D. Anderson and S. H. Neddermeyer [4] in 1937 came as a surprise, similarly surprising was the first observation of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair production by M. Perl et al. [5] at the SPEAR e + e \u2212 storage ring in 1975. As far as we know, all leptons are point-like particles, i.e. they have no substructure.",

On the other hand, a recent determination of the proton radius, derived from very precise measurements of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen atoms [9] differs by about 4% from measurements of normal hydrogen atoms and e-p scattering data. Studies of the origin of this puzzling difference are underway [10].

The e + e \u2212 colliders operated at a fixed energy of 10.579 GeV in the years 1999 to 2010. At this energy, about 20 MeV above the kinematic threshold for BB production, e + and e \u2212 annihilate and produce a particle, commonly refered to as \u03d2 (4S), which decays almost exclusively to B + B \u2212 or B 0 B 0 pairs. The maximum production rate for these \u03d2 (4S) \u2192 BB events of 20 Hz was achieved at KEK, compared to the multi-hadron non-BB background rate of about 80 Hz. B mesons from \u03d2 (4S) decays have very low momenta, \u2248 300 MeV, and therefore their decay products are distributed almost isotropically in the rest frame of the \u03d2 (4S). For this reason, the BABAR [22,23] and Belle [24] detectors were designed to cover close to 90% of the total solid angle, thereby enabling the reconstruction of all final state particles from decays of the two B mesons, except for neutrinos. Both detectors consist of cylindrical layers of sensors surrounding the beam pipe, plus endcaps to cover the small polar angles. Constraints from energy-momentum conservation allow events containing a single neutrino to be discriminated from those containing multiple undetected particles. This feature also allows for an effective suppression of non-BB background and misreconstructed events.",

For B \u2192 D \u2212 \u03bd decays, there is a sizable contribution from B \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03bd decays, for which the pion or photon from the D * \u2192 D\u03c0 or D * \u2192 D\u03b3 decay was not reconstructed. For LHCb, the peak at zero is somewhat broader and has a long tail into the signal region ( Figure 5 h) because of the sizable uncertainty in the estimation of the B sig momentum. The E * distributions (Figure 5 c,f,i) provide additional discrimination, since a lepton from a normalization decay has a higher average momentum than a lepton originating from secondary \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd decay in a  Figure 6.

ST and HT refer to the measurements with semileptonic and hadronic tags, respectively. signal B decay. Among the background contributions, semileptonic B decays to D * * mesons (charm mesons of higher mass than the D * mesons) are of concern, primarily because their branching fractions are not well known. These D * * states decay to a D or D * meson plus additional particles that, if not reconstructed, contribute to the missing momentum of the decay. As a result, B \u2192 D * * \u2212 \u03bd decays have a broader m 2 miss distribution than normalization decays. They can be distinguished from signal decays by their E * distributions which extend to higher values. At LHCb, an important background arises from B \u2192 D ( * ) H c X decays, where H c is a charm hadron decaying either leptonically or semileptonically, and X refers to additional low mass hadrons, if present. These decays produce m 2 miss and E * spectra that are similar to those of signal events (Figure 5 h,i). Figure 4 shows the measured values for R D and R D * by BABAR [28], Belle [34,35], and LHCb [36]. These results include a recent measurement of R D * by Belle that employs a semileptonic tag, but do not include earlier results from BABAR [38,39] and Belle [40,41] based on partial data sets.

It is not inconceivable that the experiments have underestimated these uncertainties, or missed a more conventional explanation. Furthermore, while it is unlikely, it cannot be totally excluded that the theoretical SM predictions are not as firm as presently assumed. Currently, the experimenters are continuing their analysis efforts, refining their methods, enhancing the signal samples by adding additional decay modes, improving the efficiency and selectivity of the tagging algorithms, as well as the Monte Carlo simulations, and scrutinizing all other aspects of the signal extraction.",

In addition, searches for lepton universality violation in semileptonic decays of other B mesons and baryons are being planned. Beyond that, LHCb will continue to record data at the highest pp collision energy available. By the end of 2017, the accumulated data sample is expected to increase by a factor of three. In the longer term future, LHCb is planning to further enhance the data rate capability and record much larger event samples.",

In parallel, the capabilities of the Belle detector are also being upgraded. The operation of this new and more powerful detector is expected to start in 2018. The much larger event samples and the constrained BB kinematics will allow more precise measurements of kinematic distributions and detailed studies, for instance, of the \u03c4 polarization in B \u2192 D * \u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 decays. The feasibility of such a measurement was recently presented [63]. For B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decays, which currently have statistical and systematic uncertainties of 30% or more for individual measurements, the substantially larger data samples are expected to lead to major reductions in these uncertainties allowing more accurate assessments of the compatibility with the SM predictions. Detailed studies of the overall physics goals and precision measurements that can be achieved by Belle II and LHCb are ongoing.",

            "text": "In recent years, several experiments have examined decay rates and angular distributions for B + decays involving a K ( * )+ meson and a lepton pair, B + \u2192 K ( * )+ \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K ( * )+ e + e \u2212 . In the framework of the SM these decays are very rare, since they involve b \u2192 s quark transitions. LHCb [64] recently published a measurement of the ratio, R K = B(B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) B(B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 ) = 0.745 +0.090 \u22120.074 \u00b1 0.036, (9) a value that is 2.6 standard deviations below the SM expectation of about 1.0. Earlier measurements by Belle [65], CDF [66], and BABAR [67] had significantly larger uncertainties and were fully consistent with lepton universality. Some theoretical models include new types of interactions that can explain this result. For instance, leptoquarks which can mediate this decay and result in higher rates for electrons than muons [68,69]. BABAR [67], LHCb [70] and Belle [71] have analyzed angular distributions for the four decay modes and observed general agreement with SM predictions, except for local deviations, the most significant by LHCb at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. Also here, more data are needed to enhance the significance of these measurements and find possible links to B decays involving \u03c4 leptons. If the currently observed excess in the ratios R D and R D * is confirmed, experimenters will use their large data samples to measure properties of signal events and learn about the nature of the new particles and interactions that contribute to these decays [72,73].",

Extraction of the ratios R D and R D * by maximum likelihood fits: Comparison of the projections of the measured m 2 miss and E * distibutions (data points) and the fitted distributions of signal and background contributions for the BABAR fit[28] to the D samples (a-c) and D * samples (d-f), as well the LHCb fit[36] to the D * + sample (g-i). The D samples in (a-c) show sizable contributions from B 0 \u2192 D * + \u2212 \u03bd and B 0 \u2192 D * + \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decays, where the low energy pion or photon originating from a D * \u2192 D\u03c0 or D * \u2192 D\u03b3 transition was undetected. The BABAR data exclude q 2 < 4 GeV 2 , where the contributions from signal decays is very small. The E * distributions in (c) and (f) are signal enhanced by the restriction m 2 miss > 1 GeV 2 . The LHCb results are presented for two different q 2 intervals, the lowest, which is free of B 0 \u2192 D * + \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decays (g), and the highest where this contribution is large (h,i).",

None of this would have been achieved without the efforts of the teams at SLAC, KEK and CERN who achieved excellent beam conditions and delivered high luminosities of the e + e \u2212 and pp storage rings over many years.
