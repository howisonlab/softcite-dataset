            "text": "In the quark model mesons are described as bound states of quarks and anti-quarks. They are characterized by a set of quantum numbers, which are isospin I, G-parity (for light unflavoured mesons), the total spin J, parity P and, for neutral mesons, charge conjugation parity C. Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) predicts the existence of states beyond the quark model, like hybrids, i.e. systems consisting of a color octet qq pair neutralized in color by gluonic excitation, or glue balls, consisting only of glue. The experimental identification of such states, however, is difficult due to mixing with qq configurations with the same quantum numbers. The observation of meson states whose quantum numbers can not be explained within the quark model, e.g. J PC = 0 \u2212\u2212 , 0 +\u2212 , 1 \u2212+ , ..., would be an evidence for quark-gluon configurations beyond the quark model. The lightest hybrid, predicted in a mass region of 1.3 -2.2 GeV/c 2 , is expected to have exotic quantum numbers J PC = 1 \u2212+ [1], and therefore does not mix with pure qq states. There are three experimental candidates for a light 1 \u2212+ hybrid. The \u03c0 1 (1400) was observed by E852 [2], VES [3], and Crystal Barrel [4]. Another 1 \u2212+ state, the \u03c0 1 (1600), decaying into \u03c1\u03c0 [5][6][7], \u03b7 \u03c0 [8,9], f 1 (1285)\u03c0 [10,11] and b 1 (1235)\u03c0 [11] was observed in peripheral \u03c0 \u2212 p interactions in E852 and VES. The resonant nature of both states, however, is still heavily disputed in the community [3,11,12]. A third exotic state, \u03c0 1 (2000), decaying to f 1 \u03c0   and b 1 \u03c0 was seen in only one experiment [10]. The COMPASS experiment will contribute significantly to the search for exotic mesons and glue balls in the light-meson sector. COMPASS, the COmmon Muon and Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy [13] is located at the CERN SPS accelerator. It is a two-stage magnetic spectrometer which provides a large angular acceptance over a wide momentum range. In addition to calorimetry and particle identification, COMPASS is equipped with a very precise charged particle tracking system. For the beam tracking, Silicon detectors around the target, Scintillating Fibers and PixelGEMs are used. Close to the beam large-size GEM detectors and Micromegas are the backbone of the tracking system. The periphery is covered by Drift Chambers and MWPCs.",

            "text": "For a data sample obtained with a Pb target during the 2004 campaign, the model, on which the corresponding fit in 40 MeV mass bins is based on, consists of 42 partial waves: 34 waves with natural parity exchange (\u03b5 = 1) and 7 waves corresponding to unnatural parity exchange. An additional background wave is added incoherently to the cross-section. Except the latter, the waves are constructed with quantum numbers ranging from total spin J = 0 to J = 4, spin projection M = 0 and M = 1 and orbital angular momentum L = S to L = G. Five isobars were used, four (\u03c1(770), f 0 (980), f 2 (1270) and \u03c1 3 (1690)) described by Breit-Wigner functions and in addition a \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave parametrized with the \"K 1 \"-solution [16] from which the complex amplitude of the f 0 (980) was subtracted. Exponential functions specify the t dependence. Thresholds on the 3\u03c0 mass were applied to most of the waves, in order to stabilize the fit. To the six most prominent waves a mass-dependent fit was applied.  established states have been studied. Figure 2e shows the phase difference to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1\u03c0S wave (Fig. 2b), which clearly rises between 1.5 and 1.9 GeV/c 2 . Figure 2f shows that the exotic wave is phase locked with the \u03c0 2 (1670) resonance in the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 \u03c0S wave, which can be explained by the presence of a \u03c0 1 (1600) with mass and width similar to the \u03c0 2 (1670). Further details of this analysis can be found in [14]. A similar analysis was applied to the large data set with the liquid hydrogen target. The waveset, used for the 2004 analysis, was extended due to 150 times larger statistics. Additional waves, with J = 5 and J = 6, M = 2 and waves described by a sixth isobar ( f 0 (1500) were implemented. No t dependence was introduced. A mass-dependent fit was not performed yet. The result of a fit in 20 MeV mass bins can be seen in Fig. 3. Again the intensity of the three major waves is plotted (Fig. 3a-c), while Fig. 3d shows the exotic wave, where in contrast to the previous results the signal-to-background ratio is much smaller. This effect can be observed in several M = 1 waves, which is discussed in more detail in Sec. 2.3. But nevertheless a peak centered at 1.65 GeV/c 2 and a respective phase motion (Fig. 3e) with respect to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1\u03c0S wave (Fig. 3b) can be seen in the same mass region as in the 2004 analysis. Also the flat phase difference (Fig. 3f) between the spin-exotic and the 2 \u2212+ 0 + f 2 \u03c0S wave (Fig. 3c) is in good agreement with the fit results on a Pb target. The peak-like structure at 1.1 GeV/c 2 is not yet completely understood. The fact that no change of the phase difference can be seen in the corresponding mass region in Fig. 3e, suggests a non-resonant mechanism. Further studies are underway.",

Due to different amounts of statistics both data samples are normalized to the integral of the narrow 2 ++ 1 + \u03c1\u03c0D wave in the region between 1.1 and 1.6 GeV/c 2 . A clear difference in population of M sub-states can be seen in comparison of the two data samples. As an example the total intensities of J PC = 1 ++ waves with different M projections are shown in Fig. 4. The population of M = 1 waves is significantly higher for the heavy nuclear target (Fig. 4e) than for hydrogen ( Fig. 4b). At the same time, the population of M = 0 waves is reduced for Pb (Fig. 4d) as compared to hydrogen (Fig. 4a). With the applied normalization the total intensity for both projections, however, is rather similar (Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f). The origin of this dependence is yet unexplained.",

The 2004 pilot run data on a Pb target show a strong signal of the spin-exotic \u03c0 1 (1600), observed in the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1\u03c0P wave. During the hadron spectroscopy data taking campaign in 2008 COMPASS recorded a large diffractive data sample on a proton target which in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final state exceeds the available world statistics by a factor of 10. Preliminary fit results confirm the presence of the \u03c0 1 (1600) in good agreement with the 2004 analysis, also on the lH target. A striking difference, however, is the dependence of the production strength for different M sub-states of waves on the target material which indicates a suppression of M = 1 states for light targets. Fits in mass and t bins are underway as well as leakage studies. Also Deck-like effects will be studied, in order to get a deeper insight into non-resonant contributions. This knowledge will lead to an improved mass-dependent fit to clarify the resonance nature of structures seen in the data, especially in the spin-exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ wave.",
