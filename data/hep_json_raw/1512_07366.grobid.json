On the other hand, because of the smaller production cross sections for charmed baryons, DCS decays of charmed baryons have not yet been observed; only an upper limit, B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK + \u03c0 \u2212 )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) < 0.46% with 90% confidence level, has been reported by the FOCUS Collaboration [7]. Theoretical calculations of DCS decays of charmed baryons have been very few and limited to two-body decay modes [8,9].",

For the CF decay, the subchannels and their branching fractions are taken from the Ref. [12] and the estimated efficiency of the CF decay is (13.83 \u00b1 0.05)%, where the uncertainty is from MC statistics. To estimate the uncertainty arising from the mix of intermediate states in the CF decay, the reconstruction efficiency is calculated using the efficiency of each bin of the M 2 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) vs. M 2 (pK \u2212 ) Dalitz distribution [22], shown in Fig. 4, and weighting them by the number of events in the bin of the real data. The relative difference between the reconstruction efficiencies, before and after this weighting, is 3.0%. For the DCS decay, we use the pK * (892) 0 , \u2206(1232) 0 K + , and non-resonant subchannels with branching fractions of 0.23, 0.18, and 0.59, respectively. These values represent the branching fractions for the corresponding subchannels of the CF decay, adjusted for the fact that \u039b(1520) cannot be produced in the DCS decay. With the assumed subchannels and their branching fractions, the reconstruction efficiency of the DCS decay is estimated to be (13.71 \u00b1 0.05)%, where the uncertainty is from MC statistics. Due to the low signal-to-background ratio in the DCS signal peak, the uncertainty from the assumed mixture of intermediate states cannot be estimated using the method used for the CF decay. Therefore, the largest difference between the efficiency of a subchannel and the overall reconstruction efficiency is taken as the efficiency uncertainty; the largest relative difference is 4.5% from \u2206(1232) 0 K + sub- channel. The relative efficiency of the CF and DCS decays is 1.01 \u00b1 0.05, where the uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the composition of the intermediate states as described above.",

Sources of the systematic uncertainty and their values are listed in Table I. The uncertainty from the binning and range of the fits is estimated by changing the bin width to 3 MeV/c 2 and adjusting the fitted range of the invariant mass distributions. The uncertainty due to the PDF shapes is estimated by changing the order of the polynomial background function, by changing the signal function to the sum of three Gaussian distributions, and by fixing the resolution of the signal function to the MCderived resolution value. The PID uncertainty is determined by data-MC comparison of several control samples. We treat the relative efficiency difference between charge-conjugate modes as a systematic uncertainty. The branching fraction of the CF decay, (6.84 \u00b1 0.24 +0.21 \u22120.27 ) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , was already well-measured in a previous Belle analysis [23].

In addition, we note that the observed DCS/CF ratio for charmed baryons is not significantly different from the measured ratio for charmed meson decay.",

This result sheds new light on charmed hadron decays, and such DCS measurements are important ingredients in modeling the non-leptonic decays of hadrons. However, the current experimental precision on the strengths of DCS modes and the level of detail of the available theoretical results are not sufficient to constrain the relative importance of the different subprocesses shown in Fig. 1. Future progress in this field will require more precise experimental measurements as well as more refined theoretical calculations.",
