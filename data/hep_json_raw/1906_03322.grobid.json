Spectra are measured as a function of transverse momentum in proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a nucleonnucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The measurement is performed within the + c rapidity interval |y| < 1 in the p T range of 5-20 GeV/c in pp and 10-20 GeV/c in PbPb collisions. The observed yields of + c for p T of 10-20 GeV/c suggest a suppression in central PbPb collisions compared to pp collisions scaled by the number of nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. The + c /D 0 production ratio in pp collisions is compared to theoretical models. In PbPb collisions, this ratio is consistent with the result from pp collisions in their common p T range.",

            "text": "Measurements of heavy-quark production provide unique inputs in understanding the parton energy loss and the degree of thermalization in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1] formed in high energy heavy ion collisions. Compared to light quarks, different energy loss mechanisms [2] are expected to dominate the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium. Besides the inmedium interactions, a detailed study of the hadronization process is critical for the interpretation of experimental data. In relativistic heavy ion collisions, in addition to the fragmentation process present in proton-proton (pp) collisions, hadron production can also occur via coalescence, where partons combine with each other while traversing the QGP medium or at the phase boundary [3,4]. At high transverse momentum (p T 6 GeV/c), the probability of coalescence is reduced, and therefore the hadronization process is expected to be dominated by fragmentation. In the intermediate p T region (2 p T 6 GeV/c), a significant enhancement of the baryon-to-meson ratio is observed in heavy ion collisions for hadrons with up, down, or strange quarks [5,6]. This enhancement, and its dependence on centrality (i.e., the degree of overlap of the two colliding nuclei) can be explained in a scenario with hadronization via coalescence. Furthermore, elliptic flow, the second Fourier component of the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles, is found to roughly scale with the number of constituent E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. quarks in the p T range of 2-5 GeV/c at RHIC [7], an observation which is also consistent with the expectation for coalescence.",

            "text": "A significant contribution of coalescence to the hadronization of charm quarks from the QGP medium is supported by various measurements of charmonium and open charm production at RHIC and LHC energies [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. One such observable is the nuclear modification factor, R AA , which is the ratio of the yield in heavy ion collisions to that in pp collisions scaled by the number of nucleonnucleon (NN) interactions. At RHIC, the R AA for J/\u03c8 mesons with p T \u2264 7 GeV/c produced in AuAu collisions decreases significantly from peripheral to central collisions [8]. In contrast, in higher energy PbPb collisions at the LHC, the J/\u03c8 R AA has a much smaller centrality dependence [9,10]. The difference between the AuAu and PbPb results can be explained by a larger coalescence probability in PbPb collisions because of the larger number of produced charm and anti-charm quarks at the higher center-of-mass energy. For D 0 meson production in AuAu collisions, R AA is observed to increase with p T up to 1.5 GeV/c and decrease with p T from 2 to 6 GeV/c, an effect that can be qualitatively reproduced by models involving coalescence [11,12]. At the LHC, the measurements of D 0 R AA and D 0 azimuthal anisotropy [13][14][15][16] are well explained by models involving coalescence. The relative coalescence contribution to baryon production is expected to be more significant than for mesons because of their larger number of constituent quarks. In particular, models involving coalescence of charm and light-flavor quarks predict a large enhancement in the + c /D 0 production ratio in heavy ion collisions relative to pp collisions and also predict that the enhancement has a strong p T dependence [17][18][19][20].

All tracks must have p T > 0.7 (1.0) GeV/c for pp (PbPb) events. During the invariant mass reconstruction, both possibilities for the mass assignments of the same-sign tracks are considered, while the kaon mass is assigned to the opposite-signed track. Using simulated events, the incorrect assignment was found to produce a broad distribution in the invariant mass (about 30 times the signal width) and is indistinguishable from the combinatorial background. As the event multiplicities for pp and PbPb collisions are substantially different, the selection criteria were optimized separately. In the optimization, simulated events in which a reconstructed + c candidate is matched to a generated + c baryon are used as the signal sample, and data events from the mass sideband region are used as the background sample. Requirements are made on three topological and three kinematic variables. The three topological criteria are: the \u03c7 2 probability of the vertex fit to the three charged tracks making up the + c candidate, the angle between the + c candidate momentum and the vector connecting the production and decay vertices in radians (\u03b1), and the separation between the two vertices. While more than one collision per bunch crossing is rare in PbPb collisions, it is common in pp collisions. Therefore, two-dimensional variables in the transverse plane with respect to the beamline are used for \u03b1 and decay length in pp collisions, while three-dimensional variables with respect to the primary vertex are used for PbPb collisions. For the PbPb events, the topological requirements are \u03c7 2 probability above 20%, \u03b1 < 0.1, and decay length greater than 3.75\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the uncertainty in the separation. For pp events, the corresponding requirements are \u03c7 2 probability above 8%, \u03b1 < 0.4, and decay length greater than 2.25\u03c3 .

A generator-only pythia 8 sample of nonprompt + c events is reweighted to match the p T -differential b hadron cross section from a fixed-order plus next-to-leading logarithm (FONLL) calculation [41]. The resulting p T -differential cross section for nonprompt + c baryons is multiplied by the appropriate luminosity, branching fractions, and A for nonprompt + c events to obtain an estimate of the number of reconstructed nonprompt + c baryons in each p T bin. Subtracting this value from the measured number of reconstructed + c baryons gives the number of reconstructed prompt + c baryons. These reconstructed prompt yields are then corrected using the prompt A as well as luminosity and branching fractions to estimate the p T -differential cross section for prompt + c baryons. Finally, the two cross sections give an alternative estimate of the nonprompt fraction in each p T bin, and therefore an alternative estimate of the weighted inclusive A value. The systematic uncertainty is taken as the difference between the nominal and alternative A values. The nonprompt fraction for events passing the pp selection criteria is found to be 28-34% for the nominal scenario (pythia 8 only) and 4-7% for the alternative method, with higher values associated with larger + c p T . The resulting systematic uncertainty varies by only \u00b11% as a function of p T so an average value of 18% is used for all p T bins. The same method is applied to the PbPb data set, where the systematic uncertainty is found to be 25% as a result of the more stringent selection criteria. For PbPb collisions, an additional systematic uncertainty is assessed by taking the difference between applying and not applying the correction for different values of R AA for nonprompt and prompt + c baryons as discussed in Section 4, raising the systematic uncertainty to 29%.",

While the shape of the p T distribution in pp collisions is consistent with the inclusive production calculation from pythia 8 using tune CUETP8M1 and activating the \"SoftQCD:nondiffractive\" processes, the data are systematically higher. The hadronization in pythia 8 can be modified by adding a color reconnection (CR) mechanism in which the final partons in the string fragmentation are considered to be color connected in such a way that the total string length becomes as short as possible [43]. The calculations using the recommended color reconnection model from Ref. [43] are consistent with our p T -differential cross section in pp collisions. The p T -differential cross section in pp collisions is also compared to the GM-VFNS perturbative QCD calculations [44], which includes only prompt + c baryon production. The GM-VFNS prediction is significantly below our data for p T < 10 GeV/c, similar to the difference found by ALICE [21]. pythia 8 predicts that 8-15% of generated + c baryons arise from b hadrons, with the low (high) value corresponding to the + c p T interval 5 < p T < 6 GeV/c (10 < p T < 20 GeV/c). Therefore, accounting for the effects of nonprompt + c production will only marginally reduce the disagreement with the GM-VFNS prediction.",

The results suggest that + c is suppressed in PbPb collisions for p T > 10 GeV/c, but no conclusion can be drawn because of the large uncertainties. The difference in R AA values between the 0-30% and 30-100% centrality ranges is consistent with an enhanced suppression in the more central PbPb collisions. Fig. 4 shows the + c /D 0 production ratio as a function of p T for pp collisions and PbPb collisions in the centrality range 0-100%. The production ratio found from pp collisions is similar in shape versus p T but about three times larger in magnitude compared to the calculation from pythia 8.212 tune CUETP8M1. Results using the Monash 2013 [45] tune are found to be consistent with those from the CUETP8M1 tune. Besides providing a reasonable description of + c baryon p T -differential cross sections, Fig. 4 shows that calculations using a color reconnection model are consistent with our results for the + c /D 0 production ratio in pp collisions. pythia 8 with color reconnection [43] (open stars), and GM-VFNS [44] (open circles labeled \"JHEP 12 (2017) 021\") along with ratios to the data in the lower two panels. The pythia 8 (GM-VFNS) predictions are for inclusive (prompt) + c production. The error bars on the GM-VFNS prediction account for the scale variation uncertainty. The lower panels show the data-to-prediction ratio for pp collisions with inner and outer error bars corresponding to the statistical and total uncertainty in the data, respectively, and the shaded box at unity indicating the 21% normalization uncertainty. The shaded boxes in the bottom panel represent the GM-VFNS uncertainty. Fig. 3. The nuclear modification factor R AA versus N part for inclusive + c production. The error bars represent the PbPb yield statistical uncertainties. The boxes at each point include the PbPb systematic uncertainties associated with the signal extraction, p T spectrum, selection criteria, track reconstruction, and T AA . The band at unity labeled pp uncertainty includes these same uncertainties for the pp data (except for T AA ) plus the uncertainties in pp yield and luminosity. The band at unity labeled PbPb includes the uncertainty from the nonprompt fraction (accounting for a partial cancelation between pp and PbPb) and MB selection efficiency. The pp data are also compared with two predictions which are for the prompt + c over D 0 production ratio. Calculations using a model that includes both coalescence and fragmentation in pp collisions [20] are shown in Fig. 4 by the solid line. Compared to the data, this model predicts a stronger dependence on p T and underestimates the measurements. Another recent model [46] attempts to use a statistical hadronization approach to explain the large + c /D 0 production ratio as arising from + c baryons that are produced from the decay of excited charm baryon states not included in Ref. [39] and are therefore not included in the hadronization simulation in pythia 8. The prediction of this model, also shown in Fig. 4 by the dashed line, provides a reasonable description of the data for p T < 10 GeV/c. While the ALICE results indicate an enhancement in the + c /D 0 production ratio in the p T range of 6-12 GeV/c for PbPb [22] compared to pPb and pp collisions, the CMS PbPb measurement in the p T range 10-20 GeV/c is consistent with the pp result. This lack of an enhancement may suggest that there is no significant contribution from the coalescence process for p T > 10 GeV/c in PbPb collisions.",

A hint of suppression of + c production for 10 < p T < 20 GeV/c is observed in PbPb when compared to pp data, with central PbPb events showing stronger suppression. This is consistent with the suppression observed in D 0 meson measurements, which is understood to originate from the strong interaction between the charm quark and the quarkgluon plasma. The + c /D 0 production ratios in pp collisions are consistent with a model obtained by adding color reconnection in hadronization to pythia 8, and also with a model that includes enhanced contributions from the decay of excited charm baryons. The + c /D 0 production ratios in pp and PbPb collisions for p T = 10-20 GeV/c are found to be consistent with each other.

The 20 and 31% normalization uncertainties in pp and PbPb collisions, respectively, are not included in the boxes representing the systematic uncertainties for each data point. The open crosses and open stars represent the predictions of pythia 8 with the CUETP8M1 tune and with color reconnection[43], respectively. The solid and dashed lines are the calculations for prompt + c over prompt D 0 production ratio from Ref.[20] and Ref.[46], respectively. All predictions are for pp collisions.",
