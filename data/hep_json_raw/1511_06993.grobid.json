These bosons are naturally predicted to be very light, even massless if the symmetry is not explicitly broken. The prominent example is the hypothetical QCD axion, the boson associated with the global U (1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry introduced to solve the strong CP problem [2].The QCD axion is basically a one-parameter theory: its mass and couplings to SM particles can be derived from a single symmetry breaking scale parameter f a , which lies presumably between 10 9 and 10 12 GeV. One can imagine other Nambu-Goldstone bosons with no specific relation between the mass, symmetry breaking scale and the couplings to SM particles, these bosons being referred to as axionlike particles or ALPs. It is interesting to note that although ALPs induce new phenomena in the infrared (because they are very light), they are associated with a symmetry breaking at an energy scale well above the electroweak scale, as it is the case for the QCD axion. Other than spin-0 ALPs, there can exist new light spin-1 bosons, arising from broken hidden U (1) symmetries, which do no decouple from SM particles even in the limit of vanishing mass [3].",

The polarization is expressed in nT; for example, a 5 cm radius spherical cell filled with 1 bar 70%-polarized gas cell generates a 30 nT magnetic field which is measured by the magnetometers at the glass surface. The statistical precision of one polarization measurement sequence, described above, is 0.16 nT.

The likelihood function L(data|a, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , f, P 0 , \u03bb, g s g p ) is built, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the data around the reconstruction model. Considering flat priors, the probability density function p(\u03bb, g s g p |data) is obtained by marginalizing the likelihood function over the nuisance parameters a, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , f and P 0 and normalizing it to 1. For each range value \u03bb between 1 and 100 \u00b5m, the a posteriori function is constructed as represented on Figure  10. The maximum of this function is for g s g p = 0, which confirms that there is no evidence of a short-range interaction for the considered range of \u03bb. To extract an upper limit on g s g p for each \u03bb with 95% C.L., an integration of the density function is performed.
