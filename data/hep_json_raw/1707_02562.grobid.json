The data used correspond to \u221a s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The results are presented in bins of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two leading jets, unfolded to the particle level and compared to the predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD is also performed, showing excellent agreement within the uncertainties. From this comparison, the value of the strong coupling constant is extracted for different energy regimes, thus testing the running of \u03b1 s (\u03bc) predicted in QCD up to scales over 1 TeV. A global fit to the transverse energy-energy correlation distributions yields \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.1162 \u00b1 0.0011 (exp.) +0.0084 \u22120.0070 (theo.), while a global fit to the asymmetry distributions yields a value of \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.1196 \u00b1 0.0013 (exp.)",

            "text": "Experimental studies of the energy dependence of event shape variables have proved very useful in precision tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Event shape variables have been measured in e + e \u2212 experiments from PETRA-PEP [1][2][3] to LEP-SLC [4][5][6][7] energies, at the ep collider HERA [8][9][10][11][12] as well as in hadron colliders from Tevatron [13] to LHC energies [14,15]. Most event shape variables are based on the determination of the thrust's principal axis [16] or the sphericity tensor [17]. A notable exception is given by the energy-energy correlations (EEC), originally proposed by Basham et al. [18], and measurements [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] of these have significantly improved the precision tests of perturbative QCD (pQCD). The EEC is defined as the energy-weighted angular distribution of hadron pairs produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation and, by construction, the EEC as well as its associated asymmetry (AEEC) are infrared safe. The second-order corrections to these functions were found to be significantly smaller [32][33][34][35] than for other event shape variables such as thrust. The transverse energy-energy correlation (TEEC) and its associated asymmetry (ATEEC) were proposed as the appropriate generalisation to hadron colliders in Ref. [36], where leading-order (LO) predictions were also presented. As a jet-based quantity, it makes use of the jet transverse energy E T = E sin \u03b8 since the energy alone is not Lorentz-invariant under longitudinal boosts along the beam direction. Here \u03b8 refers to the polar angle of the jet axis, while E is the jet energy. 1 The next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections were obtained recently [37] by using the NLOJET++ program [38,39]. They are found to be of moderate size so that the TEEC and ATEEC functions are well suited for precision tests of QCD, including a precise determination of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s . The TEEC is defined as [40] 1 \u03c3",

Here, x Ti is the fraction of transverse energy of jet i with respect to the total transverse energy, i.e. x Ti = E Ti / k E Tk , \u03c6 i j is the angle in the transverse plane between jet i and jet j and \u03b4(x) is the Dirac delta function, which ensures \u03c6 = \u03c6 i j . The associated asymmetry ATEEC is then defined as the difference between the forward (cos \u03c6 > 0) and the backward (cos \u03c6 < 0) parts of the TEEC, i.e. Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration presented a measurement of the TEEC and ATEEC [41], where these observables were used for a determination of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s (m Z ) at an energy regime of Q = 305 GeV. This paper extends the previous measurement to higher energy scales up to values close to 1 TeV. The analysis consists in the measurement of the TEEC and ATEEC distributions in different energy regimes, determining \u03b1 s (m Z ) in each of them, and using these determinations to test the running of \u03b1 s predicted by the QCD \u03b2-function. Precise knowledge of the running of \u03b1 s is not only important as a precision test of QCD at large scales but also as a test for new physics, as the existence of new coloured fermions would imply modifications to the \u03b2-function [42,43]. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03d5) are used in the transverse plane, \u03d5 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).",

The input objects to the jet algorithm are topological clusters of energy deposits in the calorimeters [60]. The baseline calibration for these clusters corrects their energy using local hadronic calibration [61,62]. The four-momentum of an uncalibrated jet is defined as the sum of the four-momenta of its constituent clusters, which are considered massless. Thus, the resulting jets are massive. However, the effect of this mass is marginal for jets in the kinematic range considered in this paper, as the difference between transverse energy and transverse momentum is at the per-mille level for these jets. The jet calibration procedure includes energy corrections for multiple pp interactions in the same or neighbouring bunch crossings, known as \"pile-up\", as well as angular corrections to ensure that the jet originates from the primary vertex. Effects due to energy losses in inactive material, shower leakage, the magnetic field, as well as inefficiencies in energy clustering and jet reconstruction, are taken into account. This is done using an MC-based correction, in bins of \u03b7 and p T , derived from the relation of the reconstructed jet energy to the energy of the corresponding particle-level jet, not including muons or non-interacting particles. In a final step, an in situ calibration corrects for residual differences in the jet response between the MC simulation and the data using p T -balance techniques for dijet, \u03b3 +jet, Z +jet and multi-jet final states. The total jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty is given by a set of independent sources, correlated in p T . The uncertainty in the p T value of individual jets due to the JES increases from (1-4)% for |\u03b7| < 1.8 to 5% for 1.8 < |\u03b7| < 4.5 [63].",

In order to study the kinematical dependence of such observables, and thus the running of the strong coupling with the energy scale involved in the hard process, the binning introduced in Table 1 is used. Figure 1 compares the TEEC and ATEEC distributions, measured in two of these bins, with the MC predictions from Pythia8, Herwig++ and Sherpa. The TEEC distributions show two peaks in the regions close to the kinematical endpoints cos \u03c6 = \u00b11.

The total uncertainty, including statistical and detector experimental sources, i.e. those not related to unfolding corrections, is also indicated using an error bar for the distributions and a green-shaded band for the ratios. The systematic uncertainties are discussed in Sect. 7 one, at cos \u03c6 = \u22121 is due to the back-to-back configuration in two-jet events, which dominate the sample, while the second peak at cos \u03c6 = +1 is due to the selfcorrelations of one jet with itself. These self-correlations are included in Eq. 1and are necessary for the correct normalisation of the TEEC functions. The central regions of the TEEC distributions shown in Fig. 1 are dominated by gluon radiation, which is decorrelated from the main event axis as predicted by QCD and measured in Refs. [65,66].",

This was cross-checked using the difference between Pythia and Sherpa, leading to similar results. This is the dominant experimental uncertainty for this measurement, being always below 5% for the TEEC distributions, and being larger for low H T2 . \u2022 Unfolding: The mismodelling of the data made by the MC simulation is accounted for as an additional source of uncertainty. This is assessed by reweighting the transfer matrices so that the level of agreement between the detector-level projection and the data is enhanced. The modified detector-level distributions are then unfolded using the method described in Sect. 6. The difference between the modified particle-level distribution and the nominal one is then taken as the uncertainty. This uncertainty is smaller than 0.5% for the full cos \u03c6 range for all bins in H T2 . The impact of this uncertainty on the TEEC function is below 1%. \u2022 Jet Angular Resolution: The uncertainty in the jet angular resolution is propagated to the TEEC measurements by smearing the azimuthal coordinate \u03d5 of each jet by 10% of the resolution in the MC simulation. This is motivated by the track-to-cluster matching studies done in Ref. [65]. This impacts the TEEC measurement at the level of 0.5%. \u2022 Jet cleaning: The modelling of the efficiency of the jetcleaning cuts is considered as an additional source of experimental uncertainty.

The relevant scale for the perturbative calculation is the renormalisation scale, as variations of the factorisation scale lead to small variations of the physical observable. The scale choice for the NLO pQCD templates used to extract \u03b1 s as well as for the presentation of the measurement is not uniquely defined. The nominal scale choice, H T2 /2, used in this paper is based on previous publications [41,76]. However, it should be noted that other scale choices, which explicitly take into account the kinematics of the third jet, are also viable options and can be considered in future measurements.",

In order to compare these predictions with the data, one needs to correct for non-perturbative (NP) effects, namely hadronisation and the underlying event.

These factors, which are calculated using several MC models, are used to correct the pQCD prediction to the particle level by multiplying each bin of the theoretical distributions. Figure 5 shows the distributions of the factors for the TEEC as a function of cos \u03c6 and for two bins in the energy scale H T2 .

Here, n f is the number of active flavours at the scale Q, i.e. the number of quarks with mass m < Q. Therefore, n f = 6 in the six bins considered in Table 1. When evolving \u03b1 s (m Z ) to \u03b1 s (Q), the proper transition rules for n f = 5 to n f = 6 are applied so that \u03b1 s (Q) is a continuous function across quark thresholds. Finally, the results are combined by performing a global fit, where all bins are merged together.  [79], as well as with previous measurements, in particular with previous extractions using LHC data [41,76,[80][81][82][83][84]. The values of the \u03c7 2 indicate that agreement between the data and the theoretical predictions is good. The nuisance parameters for the TEEC fits are generally compatible with zero. One remarkable exception is the nuisance parameter associated to the modelling uncertainty, which deviates by half standard deviation with a very small error bar. This is an indication that these data can be used to further tune MC event generators which model multi-jet production. Figure 8 compares the data with the theoretical predictions after the fit, i.e. where the fitted values of \u03b1 s (m Z ) and the nuisance parameters are already constrained. Table 3 shows the values of \u03b1 s evolved from m Z to the corresponding scale Q using Eq. (5). The appendix includes tables in which the values of \u03b1 s (m Z ) obtained from the TEEC fits are extrapolated to different values of Q, given by the averages of kinematical quantities other than H T2 /2.",

The data, binned in six intervals of the sum of transverse momenta of the two leading jets, H T2 = p T1 + p T2 , are corrected for detec-tor effects and compared to the predictions of perturbative QCD, corrected for hadronisation and multi-parton interaction effects. The results show that the data are compatible with the theoretical predictions, within the uncertainties.",

Additionally, global fits to the TEEC and ATEEC data are performed, leading to respectively. Conservatively, the values obtained using the NNPDF 3.0 PDF set are chosen, as they provide the largest PDF uncertainty among the four PDF sets investigated. These two values are in good agreement with the determinations in previous experiments and with the current world average \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.1181 \u00b1 0.0011.
