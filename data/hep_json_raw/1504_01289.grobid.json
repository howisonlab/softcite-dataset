The v m -v n correlations are measured in midrapidity as a function of centrality, and, for events within the same centrality interval, as a function of event ellipticity or triangularity defined in a forward rapidity region. For events within the same centrality interval, v 3 is found to be anticorrelated with v 2 and this anticorrelation is consistent with similar anticorrelations between the corresponding eccentricities, 2 and 3 . However, it is observed that v 4 increases strongly with v 2 , and v 5 increases strongly with both v 2 and v 3 . The trend and strength of the v m -v n correlations for n = 4 and 5 are found to disagree with mn correlations predicted by initial-geometry models. Instead, these correlations are found to be consistent with the combined effects of a linear contribution to v n and a nonlinear term that is a function of v 2 2 or of v 2 v 3 , as predicted by hydrodynamic models. A simple two-component fit is used to separate these two contributions. The extracted linear and nonlinear contributions to v 4 and v 5 are found to be consistent with previously measured event-plane correlations.",

            "text": "Heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) create hot and dense matter that is thought to be composed of strongly coupled quarks and gluons. The distribution of this matter in the transverse plane is both nonuniform in density and asymmetric in shape [1,2]. The matter expands under large pressure gradients, which transfer the inhomogeneous initial condition into azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles in momentum space [3,4]. Hydrodynamic models are used to understand the space-time evolution of the matter by comparing predictions with the measured azimuthal anisotropy [5][6][7]. The success of these models in describing the anisotropy of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] places significant constraints on the transport properties (such as the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density) and initial conditions of the produced matter [15][16][17][18][19][20].",

For example, an analytical calculation shows that the v 4 signal comprises a term proportional to 4 (linear response term) and a leading nonlinear term that is proportional to 2 2 [23,26], v 4 e i4 4 = a 0 4 e i4 4 + a 1 ( 2 e i2 2 ) 2 + \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = c 0 e i4 4 + c 1 (v 2 e i2 2 ) 2 + \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , (5) where the second line of the equation follows from Eq. 3, c 0 = a 0 4 denotes the linear component of v 4 , and coefficients a 0 , a 1 , and c 1 are weak functions of centrality.

            "text": "Owing to fluctuations of nucleon positions in the initial state, n and v n vary from event to event, which can be described by probability distributions p( n ) and p(v n ). Recent measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration [13] show that the distributions p(v n ) are very broad: Even for events in a very narrow centrality interval, v 2 and v 3 can fluctuate from zero to several times their mean values. If events with different v 2 or v 3 values could be selected cleanly, one would be able to control directly the relative sizes of the linear and nonlinear contributions to v 4 and v 5 in Eqs. (5) and (6) and hence provide an independent method of separating these two contributions. Such an event-shape selection method has been proposed in Refs. [27,28], where events in a narrow centrality interval are further classified according to the observed ellipticity or triangularity in a forward rapidity region. These quantities are estimated from the \"flow vector\" q m (m = 2 and 3), as described in Sec. IV A. This classification gives events with similar multiplicity but with very different ellipticity or triangularity. By measuring the v n and v m in a different rapidity window for each q m event class, the differential correlation between v m and v n can be obtained in an unbiased way for each centrality interval, which allows the separation of the linear and nonlinear components in v 4 and v 5 . The extracted linear component of v 4 and v 5 can then be used to understand the collective response of the medium to the initial eccentricity of the same order, using an approach similar to Eq. (4).",

The procedure for obtaining v n in this analysis is identical to that used in a previous ATLAS publication [11], which is also based on the same data set. The main difference is that, in this analysis, the events are classified both by their centrality and by the observed q 2 or q 3 at forward pseudorapidity. Most systematic uncertainties are common to the two analyses.",

All of these are well suited for measurements of azimuthal anisotropies over a large pseudorapidity range. This analysis primarily uses two subsystems: the inner detector (ID) and the forward calorimeter (FCal). The ID is contained within the 2-T field of a superconducting solenoid magnet and measures the trajectories of charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and over the full azimuth. A charged particle passing through the ID traverses typically three modules of the silicon pixel detector (Pixel), four double-sided silicon strip modules of the semiconductor tracker (SCT), and a transition radiation tracker for |\u03b7| < 2. The FCal consists of three sampling layers, longitudinal in shower depth, and covers 3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The energies in the FCal are reconstructed and grouped into towers with segmentation in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 \u2248 0.2 \u00d7 0.2. In heavy-ion collisions, the FCal is used mainly to measure the event centrality and EPs [11,31].

The off-line event 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the z axis along the beam pipe. The x axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r,\u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). selection requires a reconstructed vertex and a time difference | t| < 3 ns between signals in the MBTS trigger counters on either side of the interaction point to suppress noncollision backgrounds. A coincidence between the ZDCs at forward and backward pseudorapidity is required to reject a variety of background processes, while maintaining high efficiency for inelastic processes. Events satisfying these conditions are further required to have a reconstructed primary vertex with |z vtx | < 150 mm from the nominal center of the ATLAS detector. About 48 \u00d7 10 6 events pass the requirements. The Pb + Pb event centrality [32] is characterized using the total transverse energy ( E T ) deposited in the FCal over the pseudorapidity range 3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9 at the electromagnetic energy scale [33]. From an analysis of this distribution after all trigger and event-selection requirements, the fraction of the inelastic cross section sampled is estimated to be 98 \u00b1 2%. The uncertainty associated with the centrality definition is evaluated by varying the effect of trigger and event selection inefficiencies as well as background rejection requirements in the most peripheral FCal E T interval [32]. The FCal E T distribution is divided into a set of 5% percentile bins. A centrality interval refers to a percentile range, starting at 0% relative to the most central collisions. Thus, the 0%-5% centrality interval corresponds to the most central 5% of the events. An MC Glauber analysis [32,34] is used to estimate the average number of participating nucleons, N part , for each centrality interval. These are summarized in Table I. Following the convention of heavy-ion analyses, the centrality dependence of the results in this paper is presented as a function of N part .",

            "text": "The harmonic flow coefficients v n are measured using tracks in the ID that are required to have transverse momentum p T > 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. At least nine hits in the silicon detectors are required for each track, with no missing Pixel hits and not more than one missing SCT hit, taking into account the effects of known dead modules. In addition, the point of closest approach of the track is required to be within 1 mm of the primary vertex in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions [31]. The efficiency (p T ,\u03b7) of the track reconstruction and track selection requirements is evaluated using simulated Pb + Pb events produced with the HIJING event generator (version 1.38b) [35]. The generated particles in each event are rotated in azimuthal angle according to the procedure described in Ref. [36] to give harmonic flow consistent with previous ATLAS measurements [11,31]. The response of the detector is simulated using GEANT4 [37,38] and the resulting events are reconstructed with the same algorithms that are applied to the data. The absolute efficiency increases with p T by 7% between 0.5 and 0.8 GeV and varies only weakly for p T > 0.8 GeV. However, the efficiency varies more strongly with \u03b7 and event multiplicity [31]. For p T > 0.8 GeV, it ranges from 72% at \u03b7 \u2248 0 to 57% for |\u03b7| > 2 in peripheral collisions, while it ranges from 72% at \u03b7 \u2248 0 to about 42% for |\u03b7| > 2 in central collisions.",

These procedures are identical to those used in several previous flow analyses [11,13,14,40].

Because the intervals at the highest and lowest q m values cover much broader ranges, they are further divided into 5 and 2 smaller intervals, respectively, resulting in a total of 15 q m intervals containing certain fractions of events. Starting at the low end of the q m distribution, there are 2 intervals containing a fraction 0.05 (labeled 0.95-1 and 0.9-0.95), 8 intervals containing 0.1, 3 containing 0.025, 1 containing 0.015, and 1 containing 0.01 (this last interval spans the highest values of q m ). These 15 intervals are defined separately for each 1% centrality interval and are then grouped together to form wider centrality intervals used in this analysis (see Table I). For example, the first q m interval for the 0%-5% centrality interval is the sum of the   first q m interval in the five centrality intervals, 0%-1%, 1%-2%, . . . , 4%-5%.

A natural way of quantifying the influence of detector effects on v n,n and v n is to express the single-particle and pair acceptance functions as Fourier series [as in Eq. 11] and measure the coefficients v det n and v det n,n . The resulting coefficients for pair acceptance, v det n,n , are the product of two single-particle acceptances, v det,a n and v det,b n . In general, the pair acceptance function in \u03c6 is quite flat: The maximum variation from its average is observed to be less than 0.001, and the corresponding |v det n,n | values are found to be less than 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . These v det n,n effects are expected to cancel to a large extent in the correlation function, and only a small fraction contributes to the uncertainties in the pair acceptance function. Three possible residual effects for v det n,n are studied in Ref. [11]: (1) the time dependence of the pair acceptance, (2) the effect of imperfect centrality matching, and 3the effect of imperfect z vtx matching. In each case, the residual v det n,n values are evaluated by a Fourier expansion of the ratio of the pair acceptances before and after the variation. The systematic uncertainty of the pair acceptance is the sum in quadrature of these three estimates, which is \u03b4v n,n < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for 2 < | \u03b7| < 5. This absolute uncertainty is propagated to the uncertainty in v n , and it is the dominant uncertainty when v n is small, e.g., for v 5 in central collisions. This uncertainty is found to be uncorrelated with the q m selection, and hence it is assumed not to cancel between different q m intervals.",

            "text": "Finally, owing to the anisotropy of particle emission, the detector occupancy is expected to be larger in the direction of the EP, where the particle density is larger. Any occupancy effects depending on azimuthal angle may lead to a small angle-dependent efficiency variation, which may slightly reduce the measured v n coefficients. The magnitude of such an occupancy-dependent variation in tracking efficiency is evaluated using the HIJING simulation with flow imposed on TABLE II. Relative systematic uncertainties on the measured v n owing to track selection requirements, track reconstruction efficiency, variation between different running periods, trigger selection, consistency between true and reconstructed v n in HIJING simulation, and the quadrature sum of individual terms. Most of these uncertainties are correlated between different ranges of q m (m = 2 or 3). the generated particles [13]. The reconstructed v n values are compared to the generated v n signal. The differences are taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainties. These differences are found to be a few percent or less and are included in Table II. Because this effect is proportional to the flow signal, it is expected to partially cancel between different q m ranges. Figure 3 shows the v n (p T ) for n = 2 to 5 extracted via Eq. 13for events in the 20%-30% centrality interval. The results show nontrivial correlations with both the q 2 (left column) or q 3 (right column) selections. In the case of the q 2 selection, the v 2 values are largest for events selected with the largest q 2 and smallest for events selected with the smallest q 2 , with a total change of more than a factor of two. A similar dependence on q 2 is also seen for v 4 (p T ) and v 5 (p T ) (two bottom panels). In contrast, the extracted v 3 (p T ) values are anticorrelated with q 2 ; the overall change in v 3 (p T ) is also significantly smaller (<20% across the q 2 range). In the case of the q 3 selection, a strong positive correlation is observed for v 3 and v 5 , and a weak anticorrelation is observed for v 2 and v 4 . All these correlations are observed to be nearly independent of p T , suggesting that the response of v n to the change in the event shape is largely independent of p T . As a consistency check, the inclusive results without q m selection are compared with previously published results from Ref. [11]: The differences are less than 0.6% for v 2 and increase to 2%-3% for higher harmonics, which are well within the systematic uncertainties quoted in Table II. Figure 4 shows the correlation between v n and q m for m = 2 (left column) and m = 3 (right column) in several centrality intervals in a low p T range (0.5 < p T < 2 GeV). Because the v n -q m correlation depends only weakly on p T , this plot captures the essential features of the correlation between v n and q m shown in Fig. 3. Owing to the finite number of particles in an event, the measured q m values fluctuate relative to the true values, diluting the correlations with v n . The influence of smearing on the q 2 is much smaller than that for the q 3 simply because the v 2 signal is much bigger than the v 3 signal. However, because both the v m -q m and the v n -q m correlations are measured, the results are presented directly as v m -v n correlations for various q m selections. The level of detail contained in the v m -v n correlation is controlled by the dynamic range of v m when varying the q m selection. This dynamic range depends strongly on event centrality. For example, in the 10%-15% centrality interval, v 2 is varied by a factor of 3.1 by selecting on q 2 and v 3 is varied by a factor of 2.4 by selecting on q 3 . In the 40%-45% centrality interval, however, owing to stronger statistical smearing of q m , the v 2 and v 3 are only varied by a factor of 2.7 and 1.7, respectively. Hence, the event-shape selection is precise in central and midcentral collisions and is expected to be less precise in peripheral collisions.",

With this further subdivision, each data point in Fig. 5 turns into a group of data points, which may follow a different correlation pattern. These data points are shown in Fig. 6 (markers) overlaid with the overall centrality dependence prior to the event-shape selection from Fig. 5 (the \"boomerang\"). For clarity, the results are shown only for seven selected centrality intervals. Unlike the centrality dependence, the v m correlation within a given centrality interval approximately follows a straight line passing very close to the origin. The small nonzero intercepts can be attributed to a residual centrality dependence of the v m -v m correlation within the finite centrality intervals used. This approximately linear correlation suggests that, once the event centrality or the overall event multiplicity is fixed, the viscous-damping effects on v m change very little with the variation of the event shape via q m selection. The influence of viscosity on flow harmonics is mainly controlled by the event centrality (or the overall system size).",

The boomeranglike structure in this case reflects mostly the fact that v 3 has a much weaker centrality dependence than v 2 [11].   The v m values are calculated for fourteen 5% centrality intervals in the centrality range 0%-70% without event-shape selection. The data points are connected to show the boomerang trend from central to peripheral collisions, as indicated. The error bars and shaded boxes represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. These uncertainties are often smaller than the symbol size. different q 2 event classes (markers). The correlation within a fixed centrality interval follows a path very different from the centrality dependence: The v 2 and v 3 are always anticorrelated with each other within a given centrality, whereas they are positively correlated as a function of centrality. Because the v 2 and v 3 are driven by the initial eccentricities, v 2 \u221d 2 and v 3 \u221d 3 , one may expect similar anticorrelation between 2 and 3 . Indeed, a calculation based on a multiphase transport model [46] shows that such anticorrelations exist in the initial geometry and they are transferred into similar anticorrelations between v 2 and v 3 by the collective expansion [28].",

Because the v n obtained from the two-particle correlation method effectively measure the r.m.s. values of the event-by-event v n [43], a more appropriate quantity to characterize the collective response is the ratio of v n to the r.m.s. eccentricity [22,24]: v n / 2 n . This quantity can be directly calculated for v 2 and v 3 because they are mostly driven by 2 and 3 . However, for higher-order flow harmonics, it is more appropriate to use the extracted linear component v L n to make the ratios as it is more directly related to the n . The v L n is taken as the c 0 term obtained from the two-component fits in Fig. 10 for n = 4 and Fig. 13 for n = 5. Figure 16 shows the centrality dependence of v n / 2 n for n = 2 and 3 and v L n / 2 n for n = 4 and 5 (denoted by \"linear\" in figure legend), with n calculated in the MC Glauber model (left panel) and MC-KLN model (right panel). The higher-order flow harmonics show increasingly strong centrality dependence, which is consistent with the stronger viscous-damping effects, as expected from hydrodynamic model calculations [16,48,49].

This linearity indicates that the viscous effects are controlled by the system size, not by its overall shape. An anticorrelation is observed between v 2 and v 3 within a given centrality interval and agrees qualitatively with similar anticorrelation between corresponding eccentricities 2 and 3 , indicating that these correlations are associated with initial-geometry effects. The v 4 is found to increase strongly with v 2 , and v 5 is found to increase strongly with both v 2 and v 3 within a given centrality interval. The trends and the strengths of v 2 -v 4 , v 2 -v 5 , and v 3 -v 5 correlations disagree with corresponding mn correlations predicted by MC Glauber and MC-KLN initial-geometry models. Instead, these correlations are found to be consistent with a combination of a linear contribution to v 4 from 4 and to v 5 from 5 , together with a nonlinear term that is a function of v 2 2 or of v 2 v 3 , as predicted by hydrodynamic models [23,26]. The functional form of these nonlinear contributions is eclipsed in the overall centrality dependence, but has been directly exposed in the event-shape-selected measurements reported here. A simple two-component fit is used to separate these two contributions in v 4 and v 5 . The extracted linear and nonlinear contributions are found to be consistent with those obtained from previously measured EP correlations.",

The results show nontrivial correlations with both the q 2 (left column) or q 3 (right column) selections. In the case of the q 2 selection, the v 2 values are largest for events selected with the largest q 2 and smallest for events selected with the smallest q 2 , with a total change of more than a factor of two. A similar dependence on q 2 is also seen for v 4 (p T ) and v 5 (p T ) (two bottom panels). In contrast, the extracted v 3 (p T ) values are anticorrelated with q 2 ; the overall change in v 3 (p T ) is also significantly smaller (<20% across the q 2 range). In the case of the q 3 selection, a strong positive correlation is observed for v 3 and v 5 , and a weak anticorrelation is observed for v 2 and v 4 . All these correlations are observed to be nearly independent of p T , suggesting that the response of v n to the change in the event shape is largely independent of p T . As a consistency check, the inclusive results without q m selection are compared with previously published results from Ref.[11]: The differences are less than 0.6% for v 2 and increase to 2%-3% for higher harmonics, which are well within the systematic uncertainties quoted inTable II.Figure 4shows the correlation between v n and q m for m = 2 (left column) and m = 3 (right column) in several centrality intervals in a low p T range (0.5 < p T < 2 GeV). Because the v n -q m correlation depends only weakly on p T , this plot captures the essential features of the correlation between v n and q m shown inFig. 3. Owing to the finite number of particles in an event, the measured q m values fluctuate relative to the true values, diluting the correlations with v n . The influence of smearing on the q 2 is much smaller than that for the q 3 simply because the v 2 signal is much bigger than the v 3 signal. However, because both the v m -q m and the v n -q m correlations are measured, the results are presented directly as v m -v n correlations for various q m selections. The level of detail contained in the v m -v n correlation is controlled by the dynamic range of v m when varying the q m selection. This dynamic range depends strongly on event centrality. For example, in the 10%-15% centrality interval, v 2 is varied by a factor of 3.1 by selecting on q 2 and v 3 is varied by a factor of 2.4 by selecting on q 3 . In the 40%-45% centrality interval, however, owing to stronger statistical smearing of q m , the v 2 and v 3 are only varied by a factor of 2.7 and 1.7, respectively. Hence, the event-shape selection is precise in central and midcentral collisions and is expected to be less precise in peripheral collisions.In general, correlations v m -q m and v n -q m can be measured in different p T ranges, and the derived v m -v n correlation can be categorized into three types:(1) the correlation between v m in two different p T ranges, v m {p a T }-v m {p b T }, (2) the correlation between v m and another flow harmonic of different order v n in the same p T range, v m {p T }-v n {p T }, and (3) the correlation between",
