The study is based on up to 19.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. Limits are determined on the production of scalar top quarks (top squarks) in the framework of R-parity violating supersymmetry and on the production of color-octet vector bosons (colorons). First limits at the LHC are placed on top squark production for two scenarios. The first assumes decay to a bottom quark and a light-flavor quark and is excluded for masses between 200 and 385 GeV, and the second assumes decay to a pair of light-flavor quarks and is excluded for masses between 200 and 350 GeV at 95% confidence level. Previous limits on colorons decaying to light-flavor quarks are extended to exclude masses from 200 to 835 GeV.",

The analysis is based on data samples corresponding to as much as 19.4 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 [1] of integrated luminosity from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected with the CMS detector [2] at the CERN LHC in 2012. Events that have at least four jets with high transverse momentum (p T ) with respect to the beam direction are selected and investigated for evidence of pairproduced dijet resonances. Many models of particle physics beyond the standard model (SM) incorporate particles that decay into fully hadronic final states. Supersymmetric (SUSY) models are SM extensions, which simultaneously solve the hierarchy problem and unify particle interactions [3,4]. In natural SUSY models, where there is minimal fine-tuning, the top quark superpartner (top squark) and the superpartners of the Higgs boson (higgsinos) are required to be light [5][6][7][8][9]. Natural SUSY is underconstrained in certain R-parity violating (RPV) scenarios [10]. R-parity is a quantum number defined as R = (\u22121) 3B+L+2S , where B and L are the baryon and lepton numbers, respectively, and S is the spin.

Models that incorporate RPV may allow baryon number violation through a non-zero \u03bb UDD coupling, and one such unconstrained scenario [11] is that of the hadronically decaying top squark, t \u2192 qq . If the top squarks are pair-produced in hadronic collisions and then decay via such an RPV process, the final state would consist of four jets with no momentum imbalance in the transverse plane. In addition to top squark production, hadron collider searches for pair production of resonances decaying into jet pairs are sensitive to a number of models that predict new particles carrying color quantum numbers. Some models predict pair production through gg interactions of color-octet vectors, also called colorons (C) [12], which then decay to quark pairs. The associated final state of the signal is characterized by the presence of four high-p T jets.",

Top squark signal events are generated with up to two additional initial-state partons, and each top squark decays into two jets through the \u03bb UDD quark RPV coupling. Two scenarios are considered for this coupling. First, the coupling \u03bb 312 , where the three numerical subscripts refer to the quark generations of the corresponding quarks, is set to a non-zero value such that the decay of the top squark to two light-flavor jets is allowed. The second case instead sets a nonzero value for \u03bb 323 , resulting in top squark decay into one b jet and one light-flavor jet. In both of the above cases, the branching fraction of the top squark decay to two jets is set to 100%. For the generation of this signal, all superpartners except the top squarks are taken to be decoupled [17][18][19][20][21] and no intermediate particles are produced in the top squark decay. Top squarks are generated with masses from 100 GeV to 1 TeV in 50 GeV steps for both coupling scenarios. The cross section estimates [31] are made at next-to-leading order (NLO) with next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) corrections [32][33][34][35][36], and assigned appropriate theoretical uncertainties [31]. For the coloron signal scenario, we consider the case where each coloron decays into two light-flavor jets with a branching fraction of 100%. For this signal, masses are generated from 100 GeV to 2 TeV, and NLO cross section estimates are used. For both the top squark and coloron models, the natural width of the signal resonance is taken to be much smaller than the resolution of the detector. Backgrounds from SM multijet processes are simulated through matched tree-level matrix elements for two-to fourjet production using MadGraph, and these events are showered through pythia. In all samples, the MLM matching procedure [37] is used, and simulation of the CMS detector is performed with Geant4 [38]. ",

            "text": "The optimization for the signal selection is performed as a function of the three kinematic variables described above: m/m av , \u03b7 dijet , , as well as the fourth jet p T . Because the number of expected background events is large, we use S/ \u221a B as the metric for signal optimization, where S and B are the number of signal and background events, respectively, and B is determined by using the m av of simulated SM events. The values of S and B are set to the number of events within a window of width \u00b110% centered at the generated top squark mass, where the value of 10% is roughly twice the expected resolution for signal masses. We study this metric by evaluating S and B based on events passing a number of thresholds of each kinematic variable and obtain several four-dimensional tables, in which a value of S/ \u221a B is found for every combination of the four variables. These tables are produced in the low-and high-mass search regions, and for the inclusive and heavy-flavor analyses separately. An example of this is given in Fig. 3, where the distribution for a 500 GeV top squark and for a fit to the simulated SM multijet distribution are shown for one operating point. The signal shape is bimodal owing to a small fraction of events with incorrect signal pairings, and the Gaussian peak centered at the generated mass is the part of the distribution used in the optimization. The threshold values of the four kinematic variables, corresponding to maximum values of S/ \u221a B in these tables, are taken as a working point. Because of similar results in this optimization, the inclusive and heavy-flavor searches use common working points, with the exception of the heavy-flavor analysis requirement of b tagging. A summary of the requirements is listed in Table 1 for both the low-and high-mass searches. An example of the \u03b7 dijet variable is shown in Fig. 4. The correlation between the pseudorapidity values for the two dijet systems is plotted for both 400 GeV top squark and simulated SM samples, with the region of allowed values of the \u03b7 dijet variable indicated. For the heavy-flavor search, we repeat the optimization procedure by using selections based on five different b-tagged jet configurations: at least one b-tagged jet in the event, at least one b-tagged jet in Fig. 4. The \u03b7 value for the higher-p T reconstructed dijet system versus that of the lower-p T dijet system in the selected pair. This distribution is shown for 400 GeV top squark (top) and simulated SM multijet samples (bottom), with the right hand scale indicating the expected number of events per bin. The diagonal lines indicate the optimized region of allowed \u03b7 dijet values, and events with values falling between the two lines pass this requirement.",

We use log-normal priors to model systematic uncertainties on the signal, which are treated as nuisance parameters. To ensure that the choice of background parameterization does not introduce any bias to the estimate of the background obtained from the fit, studies are performed to derive the appropriate associated uncertainties. For the choice of function used to model the background shape, we consider several families of functions as a basis of comparison: exponentials, power-law functions, and Laurent series. Using a method previously employed by CMS [47], we study the difference in expected yield in the presence of a signal by using each of these functions instead of the default one, using simulated SM events as the default background shape as input to the pseudo-experiments.",
