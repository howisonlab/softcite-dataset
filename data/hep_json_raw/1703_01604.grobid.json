These include the measurements of the soft diffractive cross sections, of the forward rapidity gap cross section, of the diffractive dijet cross section, the measurement of a large rapidity gap in W and Z boson events and the measurement of the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles in a single diffractive enhanced sample. This last measurement is the first common result of the CMS and TOTEM collaborations. Some prospects of common CMS-TOTEM data taking are also discussed.",

            "text": "Diffractive reactions represent a sizable fraction of the total inelastic cross section \u03c3 tot in hadronhadron scattering, of the order of 25% of \u03c3 tot [1]. These reactions are characterized by a color neutral t-channel exchange carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum, where t is the fourmomentum squared exchanged in the collision [2]. In proton-proton (pp) collisions, single diffractive (SD) dissociation pp \u2192 pX corresponds to the process where one of the protons emerges intact in the final state, while the other is scattered into a low-mass system X. In double diffractive (DD) dissociation pp \u2192 XY , both of the protons are scattered into low-mass states X and Y , whereas in central diffractive (CD) dissociation, pp \u2192 pXp, both protons emerge intact from the collision, with a low-mass system X produced centrally. In all cases, the energy of the outgoing protons or states X, Y is approximately equal to that of the incoming protons, to within a few percent. Diffractive events are characterized by the presence of at least one large rapidity region \u2206y devoid of hadronic activity [3], the so-called large rapidity gap (LRG), where the rapidity y is defined as y = ln[(E + p Z )/(E \u2212 p Z )], E and p Z being the energy and longitudinal momentum of the final state particle, respectively. The pseudorapidity \u03b7 = \u2212ln[tg(\u03b8/2)], with \u03b8 the polar angle of the particle, is often used experimentally instead of rapidity. Both variables are equal in the limit of a massless particle.",

The measurement of diffractive dijet production in pp collisions from the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron [18] was the first to show an important disagreement with the theoretical expectations based on the dPDFs determined from HERA data. The fraction of diffractive dijet events is a factor 3 to 10 smaller than the expectation, with the reduction becoming more important with increasing value of the struck parton momentum fraction. Collinear factorization can not be applied to diffractive hadron-hadron collisions [22,23], because additional soft or semi-hard interactions between the spectator partons, so-called multiple parton interactions (MPI), can occur and produce hadronic activity that lowers the probability for the rapidity gap to form. With this picture in mind, the reduction factor is often referred to as the rapidity gap survival probability S 2 . Various models have been investigated to determine the expected behaviour of S 2 at the LHC centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV. These models mainly differ on the type of the Pomeron amplitude describing the soft re-scatterings at the origin of the rapidity gap suppression [24][25][26][27]. Most of the theoretical calculations predict a value of S 2 0.05 for hard diffractive processes at LHC energies, but values as low as 0.004 and as high as 0.23 have been proposed [28].",

The CMS potential to achieve precise Standard Model measurements and to search for new physics is affected by the Underlying Event activity.

For POMPYT and POMWIG, the value of the upper limit is 0.21 \u00b1 0.07. After correction for the proton dissociation contribution present in the measured cross section and in the dPDFs, an estimate of the rapidity gap survival probability can be obtained and is found to be 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 for the LO MC generators POMPYT and POMWIG. If the NLO predictions based on POWHEG are used, the estimation of the rapidity gap survival probability gives a lower value of 0.08 \u00b1 0.04. It should be mentioned that the dPDFs and the proton dissociation contribution are poorly constrained in the region of the measurement. This contribution to the uncertainty of the survival probability is not taken into account. The normalisation of the diffractive predictions of PYTHIA8 disagrees with that of POMPYT and POMWIG, and the predictions would need to be scaled by a factor \u223c 2.5 to describe the data. This is a consequence of the different normalisation of the Pomeron flux in PYTHIA8 with respect to that used in the H1 fit B. For that reason, PYTHIA8 can not directly be used to estimate the gap survival probability. The present value is compatible with the CDF measurement [18,20].",

The tracking system will be complemented by timing detectors located in a new cylindrical Roman pot, which make it possible to identify the vertex associated to the scattered protons. At high instantaneous luminosity, each crossing of the proton beams has an increased probability to produce several pp collisions, and the availability of the timing detectors is critical in the presence of a high pileup environment. The data acquisition of TOTEM is expected to be fully integrated with that of CMS, opening the possibility to combine CMS and TOTEM information at trigger level.

            "text": "A review of the CMS results on diffraction has been presented. These include the measurements of the soft diffractive cross sections [30], of the forward rapidity gap cross section [30], of the diffractive dijet cross section [31], the measurement of a large rapidity gap in W and Z boson events [32], and the measurement of the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles in a single diffractive enhanced sample [33]. This last measurement is the first common result of the CMS and TOTEM collaborations. Given the importance of the diffractive contribution to the UE and the need to constrain its phenomenological description, the measurement of the soft diffractive cross sections is of primary importance. The use of the forward CASTOR calorimeter has enabled us to measure both the SD and DD cross sections, which provide valuable input to constrain the modelling of hadronization and diffraction. The measurement of the forward rapidity gap cross section is consistent with the result of the ATLAS collaboration [47] and extends the ATLAS measurement by 0.4 unit of gap size. The first observation of a diffractive contribution to dijet production at the LHC has enabled to obtain an estimate of the rapidity gap survival probability compatible with the CDF measurement [18,20]. The use of the LO MC event generators POMPYT and POMWIG gives a value of 0.12 \u00b1 0.05, while the use of the NLO predictions based on POWHEG gives a lower value of 0.08 \u00b1 0.04. The measurement of a large rapidity gap in W and Z boson events is the first observation of a diffractive contribution to W and Z bosons production at the LHC. The relative diffractive contribution in a sample of W boson events with a LRG is found to be (50.0 \u00b1 9.3 (stat.) \u00b1 5.2 (syst.))% when using a combination of the MC event generators PYTHIA6 Pro-Q20 and POMPYT to describe the nondiffractive and single diffractive components, respectively. The measurement of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles covers the largest pseudorapidity interval ever measured at the LHC and has the potential to probe the correlation between particle production in the central and forward regions. None of the models considered provide a consistent description of the measurement over the whole \u03b7 range and for the 3 different event samples.",

The data are compared to predictions of the MC event generators PYTHIA8-MBR and PYTHIA8[41] with tune 4C[42]. The fractional momentum loss of the proton, \u03be, is reconstructed from the energy E i and the longitudinal momentum p i z of the particle candidates measured in the central detector, according to the relation \u03be= (E i \u2212 p i z )/ \u221a s.The MC event generator PYTHIA8-MBR is found to give a better description of the data and is used to determine the diffractive cross sections. The SD and DD differential cross sections as a function of log 10 \u03be are determined from the subsamples without activity in CASTOR and with activity in CASTOR, respectively. The correction for the detector acceptance and the subtraction of the background contributions are determined with the PYTHIA8-MBR MC event generator. The dominant background contribution to the SD cross section originates from DD events. For the DD cross section, the dominant background contribution originates from ND events. The cross sections are measured in the range \u22125.5 < log 10 \u03be < \u22122.5. For the DD cross section, the mass of the system Y is limited to the region 0.5 < log 10 (M Y /GeV) < 1.1 corresponding to the acceptance of the CASTOR calorimeter. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are the energy scale of the HF calorimeter and the modelling of hadronization and diffraction. The measured cross sections are presented in figure 4 and compared to predictions of the MC event generators PYTHIA8-MBR, PYTHIA8-4C and PYTHIA6 [43] with tune D6T [44]. The predictions from PYTHIA8-MBR are shown for two values of the Pomeron intercept, \u03b1 = 1.08 and \u03b1 = 1.104. Both values describe the SD cross section within uncertainties, while the DD cross section is better described by the smaller value of the intercept. The predictions from PYTHIA8-4C and PYTHIA6-D6T, based on the Schuler-Sjostrand model, give a good description of the DD cross section but fail to describe the falling behavior of the SD cross section.",

One isolated electron or muon with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4 is present in the event, and no other isolated electron or muon with p T > 10 GeV is found. The missing transverse momentum is greater than 30 GeV and the transverse mass of the charged lepton and the neutrino greater than 60 GeV. An event is selected as a Z \u2192 ll candidate if the following requirements are satisfied. Two isolated electrons or muons with opposite charge and p T > 25 GeV are present in the event. At least one of the leptons has |\u03b7| < 1.4 and the invariant mass of the dilepton system is between 60 and 120 GeV.The presence of a LRG is defined by the absence of activity above the noise threshold in at least one of the HF calorimeters. This condition defines the diffractive-enhanced samples of W and Z boson events and corresponds to the presence of a pseudorapidity gap of at least 1.9 units in the event, the fiducial coverage of the HF calorimeters being limited to the region 3 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. Soft pileup events with few or no activity in the central region of the detector are not rejected by the single vertex requirement and have the ability to fill the pseudorapidity gap in the forward region. The contribution of these events to the energy measured in the HF calorimeters is found to be well reproduced by the CMS simulation.Diffractively produced W and Z bosons are more likely to be found in the hemisphere opposite to that of the gap. This is a consequence of the fact that dPDFs peak at smaller x values than the inclusive parton distribution functions (PDFs). The boson produced being boosted in the direction of the parton with the highest momentum fraction, it is more likely to be found in the direction of the dissociated system, opposite to that of the gap. This property isused to estimate the diffractive component in the samples of W and Z boson events with a LRG. The distribution of the signed pseudorapidity of the charged lepton, \u03b7 l , in W events with a LRG is shown in figure 13 for the combination of the electron and muon channels. The sign is defined according to the hemispheres in which the pseudorapidity gap and the charged lepton are found. The pseudorapidity is positive when the gap and the lepton are in the same hemisphere and negative otherwise. A total of 147 events are found with the charged lepton in the hemisphere opposite to that of the gap, and 96 events with the lepton in the same hemisphere. The asymmetry can be defined as the ratio of the difference between the numbers of LRG events with positive and negative \u03b7 l and the total number of events. The corresponding asymmetry is 21.0 \u00b1 6.4%. For the sample of Z bosons with a LRG, a compatible asymmetry of 20 \u00b1 16% is found. The data are compared to a combination of the MC event generators PYTHIA6 Pro-Q20 [58] and POMPYT that describe the nondiffractive and single diffractive components, respectively. The predictions of POMPYT show a strong asymmetry in \u03b7 l , while the nondiffractive contribution estimated with PYTHIA6 Pro-Q20 is symmetric. The relative diffractive contribution is determined by minimising the difference between the distribution of the data and the sum of the nondiffractive and diffractive MC predictions. According to the minimization procedure, the fraction of diffractive events in the sample of W events with a LRG is found to be (50.0 \u00b1 9.3 (stat.) \u00b1 5.2 (syst.))%. The choice of PYTHIA6 Pro-Q20 to describe the nondiffractive component comes from the fact that this generator gives the best description of the energy distribution in the HF calorimeters, especially at low energy. The minimization procedures based on the combination of POMPYT with PYTHIA6-D6T, PYTHIA6-Z2 or PYTHIA8 2C [42] give similar results. The nondiffractive predictions of these generators are shown in figure 13. The systematic uncertainty of 5.2% is estimated from the uncertainty on the HF calorimeter energy scale and the choice of different nondiffractive predictions in the fits.",

These data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 45 \u00b5b \u22121 with an average number of inelastic pp collisions per bunch crossing of 0.04. The minimum-bias trigger is provided by the TOTEM T2 telescopes. It contributes to the CMS global trigger decision and initiates the simultaneous readout of the CMS and TOTEM detectors. The trigger requires the presence of at least one track candidate in one of the T2 telescopes in either side of the IP. Events reconstructed by the CMS and TOTEM detectors are combined offline. The pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles dN ch /d\u03b7 are measured in the forward region covered by the TOTEM T2 telescopes (5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.4) for primary tracks with p T > 40 MeV, and in the central region covered by the CMS tracker (|\u03b7| < 2.2) for primary tracks with p T > 100 MeV. In order to limit the effects of pileup, events with more than one reconstructed vertex are rejected. The pseudorapidity distributions are measured for 3 different event topologies selected offline by the following requirements. A sample of inclusive inelastic events is defined by the presence of at least one primary track candidate in one of the T2 telescopes in either side of the IP. A sample enhanced in non single diffractive dissociation (NSD) events is selected by requiring at least one primary track candidate in both T2 telescopes, and a sample enriched in single diffractive dissociation (SD) events is obtained by requiring at least one primary track candidate in one T2 telescope and none in the other.For the completeness of the discussion, the distributions associated to the 3 different topologies are presented. The dN ch /d\u03b7 distributions are corrected for the primary track reconstruction, the vertex reconstruction and selection, the event selection, the misidentification of secondary tracks as primary ones and the multiple reconstruction of single charged particles. The final measurements are extrapolated down to p T = 0 with correction factors determined in a MC-driven way from the p T spectrum of primary charged particles. For the measurement in the central region, the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties for the inclusive and NSD-enhanced samples are the track reconstruction and the event selection. The total systematic uncertainty ranges from 5 to 7 % and 6 to 8 % for the inclusive and NSD-enhanced samples, respectively. For the SD-enhanced sample, the dominant systematic uncertainties are due to the uncertainty in the event selection and the model dependence of the event selection efficiency. The total systematic uncertainty is between 10 and 17 %. For the measurement in the forward region, the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties for the inclusive and NSD-enhanced samples are the primary track selection, the track reconstruction and the description of the material between the T2 telescopes and the IP. The total systematic uncertainty ranges from 10 to 12 % for both samples. For the SD-enhanced sample, the most significant systematic uncertainty is due to the event selection, and the total systematic uncertainty is between 16 and 18 %. The combined CMS-TOTEM measurement of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles is presented in figure 14. The results are obtained by averaging the data points in the corresponding positive and negative \u03b7 bins. The band represents the total uncertainty, while the error bars indicate the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties added in quadrature.

As previously mentioned, the successful collaboration between the CMS and TOTEM experiments has recently enabled us to complement the central CMS measurement with the scattered proton information, measured with the TOTEM Roman pots, in dedicated common runs during 2012 and 2013. Tagging of the scattered proton(s) enables to measure the four-momentum squared exchanged at the proton vertex, t, as well as the fractional momentum loss of the proton, \u03be, when studying SD and CEP processes, and to reduce significantly the proton dissociation background that is present in measurements with the CMS central detector only. In the case of CEP, tagging the scattered protons allows reconstructing the mass of the centrally produced system with a resolution not achievable with the central detector only.A common CMS-TOTEM project for a precision proton spectrometer (CT-PPS)[65] has now been approved, with installation planned at the end of the ongoing Long Shutdown 1 (LS1). This project consists of tracking and timing detectors and is comprised of two phases, with the first taking place in 2015 at the start of the LHC Run 2, and the second expected to start one year later. Data will be collected at high instantaneous luminosity with a standard low \u03b2 * value of 0.5 m. The collected luminosity is expected to be of the order of 100 fb \u22121 before the start of the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) in 2018.",
