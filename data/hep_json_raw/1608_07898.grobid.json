Beyond serving as a reference for the observations in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, p-A data also permit to measure important properties of the produced particles, essentially undisturbed by the nuclear medium due to the large rapidity gap between central production and the target rapidity region. The present paper reports on a new measurement of the electromagnetic transition form-factors of the \u03b7 and \u03c9 Dalitz decays, improving with a still higher precision the previous NA60 results based on peripheral In-In collisions [1]. Supplementary new information is also obtained for the branching ratio of the \u03c9 Dalitz decay \u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the line shape of the \u03c1 meson and possible \u03c1/\u03c9 interference effects.",

In this context, recent improved measurements made it possible to set new stricter constraints for theoretical models (see [2] and references therein). Independent support for further improvements of form factor data arises from the impact on the hadronic light-by-light contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [3,4]. In addition, the previous lack of precise measurements of the form factors was one of the main sources of systematic uncertainties in the description of low mass dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions, with major implications for the study of the in-medium modifications of the \u03c1 meson [5,6].",

The predictions of the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model for the form factors of the \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons have been tested by the Lepton-G experiment [8][9][10] with pion beams, and recently by the NA60 experiment in In-In peripheral collisions [1]. The much improved results of the latter measurement confirmed the fact that the VMD model strongly underestimates the observed \u03c9 form factor. It should be mentioned that the transition form factor of the \u03c9 meson has also been measured in the complementary reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 in the mass region M > m \u03c9 + m \u03c0 0 [8,11].

The angular acceptance is 35 < \u03b8 < 120 mrad, corresponding to the pseudo-rapidity range 2.8 < \u03b7 lab < 4.0. A silicon vertex spectrometer tracks all charged particles, including the muons, before entering the absorber. During the proton run, the main components of this spectrometer were 10 pixel planes based on the ALICE sensors [22] and two pixel planes based on ATLAS sensors [23]. The two ATLAS planes can be operated with a 50 ns gate, 4 times smaller than the one required by the ALICE planes. This is particularly important because the hits in the ATLAS sensors can be effectively used to reduce the interaction pile-up: only the tracks with hits in these two planes are kept, thus discarding the ones associated to out of time hits in the ALICE sensors. In this way, while still remaining non-negligible, with \u223c2 beam-target interactions per event on top of the one giving the trigger, the interaction pile-up can be coped with by the good granularity and redundancy of the vertex tracker.",

This is done comparing both their angles and momenta, requiring a matching \u03c7 2 less than 3. Once identified, the muons are refitted using the joint information of the muon and vertex spectrometers. These tracks will be referred to as matched muons. Muon pairs of opposite charge are then selected. The matching technique improves significantly the signal-to-background ratio and the dimuon mass resolution. The latter is 30-35 MeV/c 2 (depending on the target) at the \u03c9 mass, somewhat worse than it was in the indium run (\u223c23 MeV/c 2 ) [1] because of the heavier absorber setup. The small residual combinatorial background (originating from \u03c0 and K decays) is subtracted from the real data. Its shape is estimated with an event mixing technique, while its normalisation is established fixing the likesign (LS) component from the mixing to the LS component of the direct (same-event) muon pair sample (containing no signal from correlated pairs at the SPS energies).

Using these normalisations, we now isolate the Dalitz decays of the \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons and the two-body decay of the \u03c1 by subtracting all the other sources. The \u03c1 is retained, even if not directly involved in the measure of the electromagnetic form factors, in order to better control the systematics related to the small contribution of its low-mass tail in the mass region of interest here (M < 0.65 GeV/c 2 ). The present analysis thus isolates the Dalitz decays of the \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons by means of an inclusive measurement of the dimuon invariant mass, without the identification of the third body. Nonetheless, this approach provides reliable and remarkably precise results on the transition form factors, thanks to the large available statistics, which ensures a good control of the competing dimuon sources.",

In a first step, we isolate the individual Dalitz contributions in the spectrum of Fig. 2, subtracting the contribution of the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay and disentangling the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays as determined by the fit. The same individual data points are used for the \u03b7 and the \u03c9, subtracting for the \u03b7 the fit results of the \u03c9 and vice versa. 2 , the QED and the form factor parts can be separately assessed for each process. This allows us, in a second step, to obtain the squared form factors |F i (M)| 2 by dividing the data for the respective Dalitz decay by its point-like QED part. The pole parameters and their errors as obtained from the combined fit to both Dalitz decays (Fig. 2) are reported in Fig. 3. The first two panels of Fig. 3 also include the NA60 data points obtained in peripheral In-In [1], the Lepton-G data [8][9][10], the expectations from VMD for comparison and, for the \u03b7 meson, the data points from the recent measurement by the A2 Collaboration. Despite the much reduced errors, the form factor of the \u03b7 is still close to the expectation from VMD. The form factor of the \u03c9, on the other hand, strongly deviates from the VMD expectation, showing a relative increase close to the kinematic cut-off by a factor of \u223c10. The corresponding data points are also reported in Tables 1 and 2. It should be noted that, in isolating the two form factors, the systematic uncertainties of the pole mass, the T \u03c1 and the 0\u03c1 parameters of the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 line shape have been taken into account and properly propagated to the final points shown in Fig. 3.",

Since the steep mass depen- dence of the data points in Fig. 3 and its perfect description by the fit is suggestive for a pole not far above the kinematic limit of the Dalitz decay, an alternative parameterisation freezing the pole at the nominal \u03c1 position while allowing shapes very different from VMD was investigated as an alternative. The results were striking: satisfactory fits to the data in Fig. 2 were plainly impossible, while the deduced form factor data points in Fig. 3 were absolutely immune to the bad fits in Fig. 2. It was also specifically verified that the monotonic rise of the eta \u03b7 and \u03c9 form factors up to the last points, close to the very steep fall-off at the kinematic limits of their corresponding Dalitz decays, cannot, by any means, be ascribed to an interplay between the finite mass resolution of the detector and the steepness of the dimuon invariant mass distribution in the considered mass regions. The quantitative understanding of the mass resolution of the detector is best illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 1, showing excellent agreement between the data and the MC fit in the most sensitive peak regions of the \u03c9 and the \u03c6, with \u03c7 2 values of about 1.2 and 1.1 averaged over the uppermost 7 points, respectively. In the bottom panel of Fig. 3, the measured mass distribution of the muon pair in the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay is compared to three recent calculations described in [36][37][38] and [39][40][41]. As can be seen, all theoretical predictions show good agreement with the data up to \u223c0.55 GeV/c 2 , but fail to describe the data points close to the upper kinematical boundary, M \u2248 m \u03c9 \u2212 m \u03c0 0 . Referred to the results reported in this paper, the discrepancy is much larger than the total (statistical plus systematic) errors of the data. Another theoretical approach is described in [42]. In this case, however, calculations are limited to masses below \u223c0.4 GeV/c 2 and the corresponding prediction is not shown here.",

While such effects strongly appear in A-A collisions, due to the creation of a hot and dense medium embedding the rho, the situation for p-A interactions is very sensitive to the beam-energy scale. While at energies of the order of a few GeV cold nuclear matter effects do exist, p-A interactions at 400 GeV are expected to be essentially free from them, on simple kinematic grounds. The leading proton in the laboratory frame has a rapidity of about 6, while the cold target nucleus is left behind at rapidities around 0, except for a few hit nucleons tailing up to at most mid-rapidity. Therefore, there is no cold medium to speak of at mid-rapidity, where particle production is measured in this experiment (about 3-4 in the laboratory frame). On the other hand, the rapidity density of the produced particles is not much higher than in genuine pp in this region. The absence of sizeable in-medium effects under the conditions of the present experiment is therefore hardly surprising.",

The description was equally unacceptable for both options, with data-MC residuals far outside the data errors and the \u03c7 2 /ndf found to be as large as \u223c6 and \u223c3 for the CLAS and KEK line shapes. This sets an independent quantitative limit on possible in-medium effects of the \u03c1 in ultra-relativistic p-A collisions: it is far below the level observed at JLab and KEK energies. At the same time, the influence of assuming the low-energy shapes for the \u03c1 meson when extracting the form factor data of the \u03c9 Dalitz decay in the relevant mass region above 0.55 GeV/c 2 was found to be at most at the edge of the errors shown in Fig. 3, emphasising a remarkable robustness of those data points even in this most sensitive region.

The residual ambiguity between constructive interference, destructive interference and incoherent superposition of \u03c1 and \u03c9, with equivalent descriptions of the data, could not be resolved. Given the overall quality of the comparison between data and expected sources, no evidence is found for in-medium cold nuclear matter effects in the \u03c1/\u03c9 region.",

Within one standard deviation, this value is in agreement with that obtained in the analysis of the peripheral In-In data: B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = [1.73 \u00b1 0.25 (stat.) \u00b1 0.14 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22124 and compatible with the current value listed in the PDG [29] B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which is based on the NA60 measurement in peripheral In-In and on the older Lepton-G value. The branching ratio B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) can alternatively be obtained by integrating Eq. (5) over the allowed kinematic region 2m \u03bc < M < m \u03c9 \u2212 m \u03c0 0 . This procedure, based on the knowledge of the branching ratio B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03c0 0 ) = (8.28 \u00b1 0.28)% according to the PDG [29] together with the present results of the omega form factor, leads to a value of B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (1.018 \u00b1 0.051) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , where the cited uncertainty combines the statistical and systematic uncertainties on \u22122",
