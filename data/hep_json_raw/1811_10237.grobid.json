Some new checks on the validity of both the \u03c4-model and the usual descriptions are presented.",

Both values are far from the corresponding Gaussian values of \u03ba = 0 and \u03b1 = 2, respectively. Although the \u03c7 2 of these fits are a great improvement over that of the Gaussian fit, they are still very large. The corresponding confidence levels are 10 \u221215 for the Gaussian and 10 \u22125 and 10 \u22128 for the Edgeworth and L\u00e9vy fits, respectively. The symmetric L\u00e9vy fit is shown in Fig. 1a. The reason for the failure of the 'classic' parametrizations is readily apparent from Fig. 1a. There is a region of anti-correlation (R 2 < 1) extending from about Q = 0.5 to 1.5 GeV. The 'classic' parametrizations, which are of the form 1+ P, where P is a positive-definite quantity, are unable to accomadate the anti-correlation. This was not realized for a long time because experiments only plotted the correlation function up to Q = 2 GeV or less. In Ref. [3] Q was plotted to 4 GeV, and the anti-correlation became apparent. This anti-correlation, which one might term Bose-Einstein Anti-Correlations (BEAC), as well as the Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) are both well described by the \u03c4-model.",
