The analysis is based on protonproton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015. Two searches are performed, one targeted at a spin-2 particle of mass larger than 500 GeV, using Randall-Sundrum graviton states as a benchmark model, and one optimized for a spin-0 particle of mass larger than 200 GeV. Varying both the mass and the decay width, the most significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed at a diphoton invariant mass around 750 GeV with local significances of 3.8 and 3.9 standard deviations in the searches optimized for a spin-2 and spin-0 particle, respectively. The global significances are estimated to be 2.1 standard deviations for both analyses. The consistency between the data collected at 13 TeV and 8 TeV is also evaluated. Limits on the production cross section times branching ratio to two photons for the two resonance types are reported.",

This entails a lightest Kaluza-Klein [3] spin-2 graviton excitation (G * ) with a dimensionless coupling k/M Pl , where M Pl = M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck scale and k the curvature scale of the extra dimension. The lightest graviton excitation is expected to be a fairly narrow resonance for k/M Pl < 0.3 [4], with the width given by 1.44(k/M Pl ) 2 m G * , where m G * is the mass of the lightest graviton state. For k/M Pl = 0.1, the natural width increases from 11 GeV at m G * = 800 GeV to 30 GeV at m G * = 2200 GeV. For m G * = 800 GeV, the contributions of the natural width and of the experimental mass resolution to the width of the resonance are comparable. The shape of the invariant mass distribution of the main background from the production of prompt photon pairs is estimated from theoretical computations, and the contribution from the reducible background of events where at least one jet is misidentified as a photon is added from data-driven estimates. This approach works well up to the highest invariant masses where a small number of background events are expected. The search is performed in the mass range above 500 GeV and in the k/M Pl range 0.01 to 0.3, searching for an excess over the estimated background diphoton invariant mass distribution. To model such an excess, the RS graviton resonance shape is convolved with the experimental resolution.",

These silicon-based detectors cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A gas-filled straw-tube transition radiation tracker (TRT) complements the silicon tracker at larger radii and also provides electron identification capabilities based on transition radiation. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with accordion geometry. The calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end-cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5 it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. A thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in upstream energy losses. Hadronic calorimetry in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers and scintillator tiles as the active medium. Liquid-argon calorimetry with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A forward calorimeter using copper or tungsten absorbers with liquid argon completes the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muon tracks within |\u03b7| < 2.7, using three stations of precision drift tubes, with cathode strip chambers in the innermost layer for |\u03b7| > 2.0. The deflection is provided by a toroidal magnetic field from air-core superconducting magnets, with an integral of approximately 3 T\u2022m and 6 T\u2022m in the central and end-cap regions, respectively. The muon spectrometer is instrumented with trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. Events are selected using a first-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event rate to a design value of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [19].",

Samples for any mass or k/M Pl value are obtained by reweighting an event sample generated with a uniform mass distribution using the Breit-Wigner and parton luminosity terms. The latter sample is obtained using the Pythia8 configuration as described above with m G * = 5 TeV and k/M Pl = 0.1, with an m \u03b3\u03b3 -dependent factor that modifies the production cross section to remove the effect of the Breit-Wigner term and the parton luminosity.

Because the graviton coupling increases with the energy of the decay products, the invariant mass distribution for a large-width graviton signal exhibits a high-mass tail which is not present for a spin-0 particle with properties like those of a Higgs boson.",

Other production processes are investigated to assess the impact of the production mode on the signal modelling. MC samples are produced for different hypotheses of the spin-0 boson mass (m X ) in the range 200 GeV to 2000 GeV and of the decay width (\u0393 X ) up to 10% of m X . For the narrow-width approximation (NWA), the width of the particle is set to 4 MeV. Gluon fusion events are generated with Powheg-box [24,25], version 2, interfaced with Pythia8 for the underlying event, parton showering and hadronization. To model signals with large decay widths, a function parameterizing the theoretical line-shape of the resonance is used [15,16]. The Powheg-box implementation of a large-width spin-0 resonance with couplings like those of the Higgs boson in the SM is chosen for this function. The line-shape is modelled with a Breit-Wigner distribution based on a running-width scheme, including the dependence of the cross section on the gluon-gluon parton luminosity. In order to reduce the sensitivity to modelling effects from the off-shell region, the sample generation is restricted to the region m X \u00b1 2\u0393 X . The validity of this procedure is checked by comparing the result of this implementation with simulated samples generated with a large width in Powheg-box. Events produced via vector-boson fusion are generated using Powheg-box [26] interfaced with Pythia8. Associated production with a vector-boson or a tt pair is generated with Pythia8. The CT10 [27] PDF set is used for the samples generated with Powheg-box, while CTEQ6L1 [28] is used for the samples generated with Pythia8. The underlying-event generation for the gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion samples is based on the Pythia8 AZNLO tune [29], while for the other samples, the A14 tune is used.",

An initial loose selection is derived using only the information from the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral shower shape in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which contains most of the energy. The final tight selection applies tighter criteria to these variables, different for converted and unconverted photon candidates. It also places requirements on the shower shape in the finely segmented first calorimeter layer to ensure the compatibility of the measured shower profile with that originating from a single photon impacting the calorimeter. When applying the photon identification criteria to simulated events, the shower shapes are corrected for small differences in their average values between data and simulation. The efficiency of the photon identification increases with E T from 85% at 50 GeV to 95% at 200 GeV. For E T > 50 GeV, the uncertainty in the photon identification efficiency varies between \u00b11% and \u00b15% depending on \u03b7 and E T .

The pile-up and underlying-event contribution to the calorimeter isolation variable is subtracted from the isolation energy event-by-event [37][38][39]. The selection requirement on the calorimeter isolation variable is defined by E iso T < 0.022E T + 2.45 GeV, where E T is the transverse energy of the photon candidate. The track isolation variable (p iso T ) is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the tracks in a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 around the photon candidate. The tracks are required to have p T > 1.0 GeV and to be consistent with originating from the diphoton primary vertex, defined in section 5.1. For converted photons, the one or two tracks associated with the photon conversion are excluded from the p iso T computation. The requirement applied for the track isolation variable is p iso T < 0.05E T . The efficiency of the isolation requirements is studied using several data control samples. Electrons from Z-boson decays are used to validate the isolation variables up to E T = 100 GeV. Inclusive photon samples are used to check the efficiency of the isolation requirement in a wide E T range from 50 GeV up to 1000 GeV. Small differences between data and simulation in the average value of the calorimeter isolation variable are observed as a function of E T and \u03b7 of the photon candidates. The size of this difference is used as a systematic uncertainty. The efficiency of the combined isolation requirement for photons fulfilling tight identification selection in signal MC samples is 90% to 96% in the E T range 100 GeV to 500 GeV, with an uncertainty between 1% and 2%. The isolation requirement reduces the rate at which jet are misidentified as photons by about one order of magnitude.",

A multivariate regression algorithm [40] to calibrate electron and photon energy measurements was developed and optimized on simulated events. Corrections are made for the energy deposited in front of the calorimeter and outside the cluster, as well as to account for the variation of the energy response as a function of the impact point on the calorimeter. The inputs to the energy calibration algorithm are the measured energy per calorimeter layer, including the presampler, the \u03b7 of the cluster and the local position of the shower within the second-layer cell corresponding to the cluster centroid. In addition, for converted photons, the track transverse momenta and the conversion radius are used to further improve the energy resolution, especially at low energy. The calibration of the layer energies in the calorimeter is based on the measurement performed with 2012 data at \u221a s = 8 TeV [40]. The overall energy scale in data and the difference in the constant term of the energy resolution between data and simulation are estimated with a sample of Z-boson decays to electrons recorded in 2012 and reprocessed using the same conditions as used for the 2015 data taking and event processing. At E T values larger than \u2248 200 GeV, the energy resolution is dominated by the constant term of the calorimeter energy resolution, which amounts to 0.6%-1.5% depending on \u03b7. The energy scale and resolution corrections are JHEP09(2016)001 checked using Z-boson decays to electrons recorded in the 2015 dataset. Uncertainties in the measurements performed with this sample are estimated following a procedure similar to that discussed in ref. [40]. The difference between the values measured with the 2015 data and those predicted from the reprocessed 2012 data is also taken into account in the uncertainties. The uncertainty in the photon energy scale at high E T is typically \u00b1(0.5-2.0)% depending on \u03b7, and the relative uncertainty in the photon energy resolution for E T = 300 GeV is \u00b1(30-45)% depending on \u03b7. Additional uncertainties related to the extrapolation of the energy scale to photons of very high energies, in addition to those described in ref.",

The correct identification of the tracks originating from this pp collision is also necessary to avoid pile-up contributions to the track isolation. To keep the contribution of the opening angle resolution to the mass resolution smaller than the contribution of the energy resolution, a position resolution for the primary vertex of about 15 mm in the z-direction is required. Better resolution is needed to correctly match tracks to the pp collision vertex of the diphoton candidate. The directions of both photon candidates are measured using the longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter, with a resolution of about 60 mrad/ \u221a E, where E is the photon energy in GeV. An estimate of the z-position of the diphoton primary vertex is obtained by combining the average beam-spot position with this 'photon pointing'. It may be enhanced using the tracks from photon conversions with conversion radii before or in the volume of the silicon detectors. This estimate gives a resolution of about 15 mm in the z-direction. In order to select the correct primary vertex for the diphoton event, a neural-network discriminant, similar to the one used in ref. [42], is constructed using both the z-position of the diphoton primary vertex estimated by the photon pointing including its uncertainty and additional information from the tracks associated with each reconstructed JHEP09(2016)001 primary vertex. After applying this procedure, the contribution of the opening angle resolution to the mass resolution is negligible. The efficiency to reconstruct the correct primary vertex within \u00b10.3 mm is about 88%.",

[49] is used to check that the functional form is flexible enough to accommodate different physics-motivated underlying distributions. A large sample of diphoton pseudo-data is produced using the Diphox NLO computation, where the photon four-vectors are smeared with the detector resolution, and also with Sherpa generated samples which are then passed through the full detector simulation and the event reconstruction. The impact of the PDF uncertainties on the invariant mass distribution is also taken into account. The shape of the mass distribution for the reducible photon+jet and dijet backgrounds is estimated with data control samples selected with one or two of the photons failing the tight identification criteria but fulfilling a looser set of requirements. These samples are dominated by events with one or two jets misidentified as photons. As the limited number of data events does not directly allow a precise estimate of the mass distribution for masses above 500 GeV, the invariant mass distribution of these samples is fitted with various smooth functions providing an adequate fit to the data. The final pseudo-data set is obtained by summing the diphoton contribution and the smoothed estimate of the photon+jet and dijet backgrounds. The bias related to the choice of functional form is estimated as the fitted \"spurious\" signal [49] yield in these pseudo-data, which consist only of background events, when performing a signal-plus-background fit for various signal mass hypotheses. To be selected for the analysis, the functional form is required to have a fitted \"spurious\" signal of less than 20% of the statistical uncertainty in the fitted signal yield over the full investigated mass range. Among the forms fulfilling this criteria, the one with the lowest number of degrees of freedom is preferred. Based on these criteria, the functional form defined in eq. (7.2) with k = 0 is selected. The uncertainty in the background is estimated from the fitted \"spurious\" signal. For a narrow-signal hypothesis, it varies from 7 events at 200 GeV to 0.006 events at 2000 GeV. For larger hypothesized signal widths, the signal is integrated over a wider mass range and the background uncertainty is larger, varying from 20 events at 200 GeV to 0.04 events at 2000 GeV, for a hypothesized signal with a relative width \u0393/m of 6%. For a signal mass of 750 GeV, it varies from 0.1 events for a small width to 0.8 events for \u0393/m of 6%.",

Because of the different event selection, the functional form used to described the background for the spin-2 search selection, determined following the procedure discussed in section 7.2, is different from the spin-0 search selection and can be expressed as f (x; a 0 , a 1 ) = N e (a 0 +a 1 log(x))log (x) , where x = m \u03b3\u03b3 / \u221a s, a 0 and a 1 are free parameters and N is a normalization factor. To estimate the background in one selection scenario and for a specific approach, an unconditional signal-plus-background maximum-likelihood fit with the corresponding signal hypothesis is performed on the data. The comparison of the different background estimates is shown in table 1 for two different diphoton invariant mass windows. For the MC extrapolation method, the statistical uncertainty is directly related to the total number of events in the data sample and thus is at the level of \u00b11.5% for the spin-2 resonance search selection. For the functional-form approach, the statistical uncertainty originating from the uncertainty in the determination of the parameters of the function from the fit to the data is larger, especially at high masses. The systematic uncertainty in the MC extrapolation method originates from the sources of uncertainty discussed in section 7.1. These uncertainties are then constrained when fitting the background model to the data. For instance, in the spin-2 search selection for a mass around 750 GeV, the total background uncertainty before the fit is \u00b112%. This is reduced to \u00b13.5% after the fit to the data. For the functional-form approach, the systematic uncertainty is given directly by the \"spurious\" signal uncertainty, which depends on the signal hypothesis being considered.

The uncertainties related to the overall normalization of the signal yield, discussed in section 5.4, only affect the limits on the production cross sections, while the uncertainty in the signal mass resolution affects both the compatibility with the background-only hypothesis and the limits on the production cross section. For a narrow-width signal, the uncertainty in the mass resolution leads to a \u00b140% relative change in the fitted signal yield at masses near 750 GeV. The impact is much smaller for larger assumed signal decay widths. For the spin-2 resonance search, the background is estimated using the approach discussed in section 7.1, while the functional-form method described in section 7.2 is used for the spin-0 resonance search. The uncertainties in the background estimates, summarized in table 1, affect both the compatibility with the background-only hypothesis and the cross-section limits.

The missing transverse momentum is computed as the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of photons, electrons, muons and jets associated with the diphoton vertex and of a soft term [57], accounting for the underlying event and soft radiation, which is constructed using tracks from the primary vertex, not associated with other identified objects.",

For a particle of mass 750 GeV produced as an s-channel resonance, the expected cross section increases by a factor 4.7 for a gluon-gluon initial state and 2.7 for a light quark-antiquark initial state, as estimated with the MSTW2008NLO or NNLO PDF sets. The consistency is quantified by adding an extra modifier to the predicted cross-section ratio, which should be one if the two datasets are consistent, and treating this modifier as the only parameter of interest in the measurement. The best-fit value of this modifier corresponds to a smaller cross section at 8 TeV than expected from the 13 TeV excess.   Figure 8.

Varying both the mass and the decay width of the hypothesised resonance, the largest deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed in a broad region near a mass of 750 GeV and with a width of about 50 GeV, with local significances of 3.8 and 3.9 standard deviations in the searches optimized for the spin-2 and spin-0 resonances, respectively. The global significances are estimated to be 2.1 standard deviations for both searches. When considering narrow-width signal hypotheses, the largest local significances for the two searches are observed near a mass of 770 GeV and 750 GeV with local significances corresponding to 3.3 and 2.9 standard deviations, respectively. No significant difference is observed in the properties of the events with a diphoton mass near 750 GeV compared to those at higher or lower masses. Assuming a scaling of the production cross section for an s-channel resonance produced by gluon fusion (light quark-antiquark annihilation), the consistency between the 13 TeV data and the data collected at 8 TeV is found to be at the level of 2.
