The partial branching fractions as a function of the baryon-antibaryon mass and the polar angle distributions of the proton in the baryon-antibaryon system are presented. This study includes the first observation of B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 , which is measured to have a branching fraction of (3.00 +0.61   \u22120.53 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 10 \u22126 . We also set upper limits on branching fractions of the twobody decays B 0 \u2192 p\u03a3 * \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u2206 0\u039b , B + \u2192 p\u03a3 * 0 , and B + \u2192 \u2206 +\u039b at the 90% confidence level. These results are obtained from a 414 fb \u22121 data sample collected near the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider.",

The dominant contributions for these decays are presumably via the b \u2192 s penguin diagram as shown in Fig. 1 for the case of B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03b3. A common experimental feature of these decays is that the baryonantibaryon mass spectra peak near threshold. This feature was conjectured in Ref. [6] and has recently aroused much theoretical interest [7]. Detailed information from the polar angle distributions [8] and Dalitz plot [9] offer better understanding of the underlying dynamics.",

The partial branching fractions as a function of the baryon-antibaryon mass and the polar angle distributions of the proton in the baryonantibaryon system are presented. It is interesting to compare the results with theoretical predictions [10,11]. Since the \u039b hyperon could be a useful tool to probe the helicity selection rule for the b \u2192 s process [10,12], we investigate the proton polar angular distribution from \u039b decays. We also search for intermediate two-body decays in these three-body final states. This is motivated by the observations of two-body decays of charmed baryons [13]. Using topological quark diagrams for B decays and the assumption of SU(3) flavor symmetry, various two-body charmless baryonic decay modes should be observable with a data sample of \u223c400 fb \u22121 [14].",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) composed of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [16]. The following two kinds of inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm beam pipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector was used for the first sample of 152 \u00d710 6 BB pairs, while a 1.5 cm beam pipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 297 \u00d710 6 BB pairs [17].",

The B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 mode has more background than the other modes and therefore we add the missing mass to the Fisher variable. The missing mass is determined from the rest of the detected particles (treated as charged pions or photons) in the event assuming they are decay products of the other B meson. We form the signal (background) likelihood L s (L b ) by combining probability density functions (PDFs) for the Fisher discriminant and the cosine of the angle between the B flight direction and the beam direction in the \u03a5(4S) rest frame. The signal PDFs are determined using signal MC simulation; the background PDFs are obtained from the side-band data with M bc < 5.26 GeV/c 2 .

Figure 3 shows the differential branching fractions of B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03b3, B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 and B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 as a function of baryon pair mass, where the branching fractions are obtained by correcting the fitted B yields for the mass-dependent efficiencies estimated from MC simulation for each mode. Systematic uncertainties are determined using high-statistics control data samples. The tracking efficiency is measured with fully and partially reconstructed D * samples. For proton identification, we use a \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 sample, while for K/\u03c0 identification we use a D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + sample. The average efficiency difference for particle identification (PID) between data and MC has been corrected to obtain the final branching fraction measurements. The corrections are about 8%, 8%, and 14% for the p\u039b\u03b3, p\u039b\u03c0 0  and p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 modes, respectively. The uncertainties associated with the PID corrections are estimated to be 2% for protons and 1% for charged pions. For \u039b reconstruction, we have an additional uncertainty of 2.5% on the efficiency for tracks displaced from the interaction point. This is determined from the difference between \u039b proper time distributions for data and MC simulation. There is also a 1.2% error associated with the \u039b mass selection and a 0.5% error for the \u039b vertex selection. Summing the errors for \u039b reconstruction in quadrature, we obtain a systematic error of 2.8%. A 2.2% uncertainty for the photon detection is determined from radiative Bhabha events. For the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 vetoes, we compare the fit results with and without the vetoes; the difference in the branching fraction is 0.5%, which is taken as the associated systematic error. The uncertainty in \u03c0 0 reconstruction is studied with D \u2192 K\u03c0 and D \u2192 K\u03c0\u03c0 0 samples. The R continuum suppression uncertainty is estimated from B \u2192 D\u03c0, D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 control samples, which have topologically similar final states. The determined efficiencies near threshold contribute an error due to the binning effect in M p\u039b . Using the generated MC samples, we vary the bin size to estimate this effect. A systematic uncertainty in the fit yield is determined by applying different signal/background PDFs and by varying the parameters of the signal and background PDFs by one standard deviation. The p\u039b\u03c0 0 mode has a bigger fitting uncertainty due to a larger fluctuation in the lower \u2206E side. The error on the number of BB pairs is 1.3%, where we assume that the branching fractions of \u03a5(4S) to neutral and charged BB pairs are equal. The systematic uncertainties for each decay channel are summarized in Table I, where correlated errors are added linearly within each item, and then uncorrelated items are combined in quadrature. The total systematic uncertainties are 9.0%, 11.1% and 9.0% for the p\u039b\u03b3, p\u039b\u03c0 0 and p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 modes, respectively. Table II gives the measured branching fractions for different M p\u039b mass bins. We sum these . These values are in good agreement with our previous measurements [5,8] and supersede them. Note that the results include the first observation of B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 . The ratio of B(B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 )/B(B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 ) is 0.93 +0. 21 \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.09, which is larger than the theoretical prediction of 0.5. However, one cannot rule out the naive factorization picture with current statistics. The shapes of the near threshold peaks can be compared with theoretical predictions [10,11], as shown in Fig. 3. This comparison is useful for validating (and possibly modifying) theoretical models. We also study the two-body intermediate decays B 0 \u2192 p\u03a3 * \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u2206 0\u039b , B + \u2192 p\u03a3 * 0 , and B + \u2192 \u2206 +\u039b , where the\u03a3 * \u2212, * 0 and \u2206 0,+ are reconstructed in the\u03a3 * \u2212, * 0 \u2192\u039b\u03c0 \u2212,0 and \u2206 0,+ \u2192 p\u03c0 0,+ channels, respectively. The selection criteria are 1.30 GeV/c 2 < M\u039b \u03c0 \u2212,0 < 1.45 GeV/c 2 and M p\u03c0 0,+ < 1.40 GeV/c 2 . No significant signals are found in these decay chains. We observe 34, 50, 32 and 43 events in the signal region; the expected number of background events are 36.9 \u00b1 1.5, 51.8 \u00b1 1.8, 34.0 \u00b1 1.3 and 41.8 \u00b1 1.2 for B 0 \u2192 p\u03a3 * \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u2206 0\u039b , B + \u2192 p\u03a3 * 0 , and B + \u2192 \u2206 +\u039b , respectively. We set upper limits on the branching fractions at the 90% confidence level using the methods described in Refs. [23,24], where the systematic uncertainty is taken into account. The results are summarized in Table III. In the low mass region below 2.8 GeV/c 2 , we study the proton angular distribution of the baryon-antibaryon pair system. The angle \u03b8 p is defined as the angle between the proton direction and the meson (photon) direction in the baryon-antibaryon pair rest frame. Figure 4 shows the differential branching fractions as a function of cos \u03b8 p . We define the angular asymmetry as A \u03b8 = Br + \u2212Br \u2212 Br + +Br \u2212 , where Br + and Br \u2212 stand for the measured branching fractions with cos \u03b8 p > 0 and cos \u03b8 p < 0, respectively. The angular asymmetries are determined to be 0.29 \u00b1 0.14(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.), \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.18(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.), and \u22120.41 \u00b1 0.11(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.) for the p\u039b\u03b3, p\u039b\u03c0 0 , and p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 modes, respectively. A systematic error, \u223c 0.03, is determined by studying low momentum \u039b reconstruction in different angular regions, and by checking the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + (J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) sample and the continuum background of B + \u2192 ppK + where a null asymmetry is expected.",

They are consistent within errors. The value of\u1fb1 obtained for the p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 mode also agrees well with the theoretical prediction in Ref. [10]. The systematic uncertainty in\u1fb1 is included in the plot and is about 0.10. This is estimated by varying various selection cuts; the dominant effect is the efficiency change near the cos \u03b8 \u223c 1 region, where the detection efficiency for slow pions is rapidly changing.",

The systematic uncertainty is assigned by the measured asymmetry of the background events in the candidate region. In summary, using 449 \u00d710 6 BB events, we measure the mass and angular distributions of the baryon-antibaryon pair system near threshold for the p\u039b\u03b3, p\u039b\u03c0 0 and p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 baryonic B decay modes. We report the observation of B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 with a branching fraction (3.00 +0.61 \u22120.53 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 10 \u22126 and a low p\u039b mass peak near threshold. The measured branching fractions for B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 are in good agreement with our previous measurements [5,8]. The different proton polar angular distributions for the p\u039b\u03b3 and p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 modes indicate a difference between b \u2192 s\u03b3 and b \u2192 sg decays. The anisotropy parameters\u1fb1 from \u039b decays agree with theoretical predictions within errors. We also search for intermediate two-body decays and find no significant signals. We set upper limits on their branching fractions at the 90% confidence level. Some suppression factors [26] for the charmless baryonic two-body decays should be considered under the present theoretical framework and understanding the ",
