            "text": "The boson discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations at the LHC matches the predictions for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson within the precision of current measurements [3,4]. Several extensions of the SM predict heavy neutral scalars in addition to a low-mass scalar compatible with the discovered boson. Examples include generic models in which a low-mass Higgs boson mixes with a heavy electroweak singlet [5][6][7][8][9][10] to complete the unitarisation of W W scattering at high energies. This paper reports the results of a search for a heavy neutral scalar by the AT-LAS Collaboration in the decay mode into two W bosons. Two final states are used: H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd and H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bdqq ( = e, \u00b5). In these final states, ATLAS has previously reported the results of searches for heavy Higgs bosons using 4.7 fb \u22121 of data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV [11,12]. In the H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd final state, a SM Higgs boson in the mass range 133 GeV < m H < 261 GeV was excluded at 95% confidence level (CL), while the H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bdqq final state was not sensitive to a SM Higgs boson of any mass with the \u221a s = 7 TeV dataset. The CMS Collaboration has performed a search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H\u2192W W and H\u2192ZZ channels [13]. From a combination of the two channels, a hypothetical second Higgs boson with couplings identical to those predicted by the Standard Model is excluded in the mass range 145 GeV < m H < 1000 GeV.",

[11,12] by using an integrated luminosity corresponding to 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the AT-LAS detector. Both analyses are designed to be sensitive to a heavy Higgs boson produced through either or both of the gluon-fusion (ggF) or vector-boson fusion (VBF) processes. Both also use a profile-likelihood fit to a distribution in which the hypothetical signal is peaked but background is monotonically decreasing in the search range in order to test for the presence of signal. The H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd analysis uses the dilepton transverse mass distribution for the discriminant because the two neutrinos in the final state result in insufficient kinematic information to reconstruct the invariant mass of the W W system. The H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bdqq analysis uses as the discriminant the invariant mass of the W W system, reconstructed using the W mass as a kinematic constraint to recover the neutrino momentum up to a twofold ambiguity. The results of the searches are interpreted in three scenarios: JHEP01(2016)032 1. A Higgs boson with the couplings predicted by the SM for a Higgs boson at high mass and a width correspondingly increasing with m H , and the lineshape modeled by the complex-pole scheme (CPS) for most mass hypotheses, as explained in section 2. Accordingly, this is referred to as the CPS scenario.",

The width of a SM Higgs boson increases with increasing mass. For example, it is \u223c 30 GeV at m H = 400 GeV, and increases to \u223c 650 GeV at m H = 1000 GeV. Up to m H \u223c 400 GeV, the lineshape of the W W invariant mass (m W W ) distribution is well described by a Breit-Wigner distribution with a running width, meaning that the Higgs boson propagator is calculated for each event based on m W W as described in ref. [14]. For m H \u2265 400 GeV, the complex-pole scheme [15][16][17] provides a more accurate description. The CPS propagator is therefore used to describe the lineshape of the Higgs boson produced via both the ggF and VBF processes for m H \u2265 400 GeV [18][19][20]. The limits using this signal hypothesis are labeled \"CPS scenario\" even though a Breit-Wigner distribution is used for m H < 400 GeV. For that mass range the distributions are similar, so this is a minor simplification.",

The second correction depends on the number of reconstructed primary vertices and the mean number of expected interactions. After these corrections, an energy-and \u03b7-dependent calibration is applied to all jets. Finally, a residual correction from in situ measurements is applied to refine the jet calibration. In both analyses, jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV if they have | \u03b7 | < 2.4. For jets with 2.4 < | \u03b7 | < 4.5, the p T threshold is raised to 30 GeV. The increased threshold in the forward region reduces the contribution from jet candidates produced by pile-up.

Therefore, in this analysis the hadronic W decay can also be reconstructed as a single jet found by the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm [31], built from topological clusters with a radius parameter of 1.2, referred to as large-R jets. These jets can mitigate the loss of signal efficiency, and background can be reduced by selecting those with features typical of jets originating from two hard partons.

The calorimeter-based definition, E miss T,calo , is the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of muons, electrons, photons, and jets. Clusters of calibrated calorimeter cells that are not associated with any of these objects are also included [35]. This definition takes advantage of the hermeticity of the calorimeters and their ability to measure energies of neutral particles. However, the resolution of the calorimeter-based quantity is degraded by the significant event pile-up. The resolution can be improved by using track-based measurements of the momenta of particles not associated with an identified object to replace the calorimeter cell based measurements. The tracks are required to have p T > 0.5 GeV and must originate from the primary vertex. In practice, the p T of these tracks replace the E T of calorimeter cells not associated with identified objects. The accurate primary-vertex association makes the track-based measurement more robust against pile-up than the calorimeter-based measurement. The quantity thus formulated is referred to as p miss T . Using the direction of p miss T relative to leptons and jets improves the rejection of Drell-Yan backgrounds in the H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd final state.

Heavy Higgs boson production via the ggF and VBF processes are considered in both the H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd and H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03bdqq analysis channels. Contributions from Higgsstrahlung and ttH production mechanisms are not considered owing to their very small cross sections at high Higgs boson masses. For leptonic W decays, the small contribution from leptonic W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd decays is included. The ggF signal cross-section calculation includes corrections up to next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) in QCD [49][50][51][52][53][54]. Next-to-leading-order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections are also applied [55,56], as well as QCD soft-gluon resummations up to next-tonext-to-leading logarithmic order (NNLL) [57]. These calculations are described in refs. [14,58,59] and assume factorisation between the QCD and EW corrections. The VBF signal cross section is computed with approximate NNLO QCD corrections [60] and full NLO QCD and EW corrections [61][62][63]. The total width for the CPS scenario follows the SM predictions for high mass and has been calculated using Hdecay [64]. The branching fractions for the decay to W W as a function of m H have been calculated using Prophecy4f [65,66].",

The top-quark and W W backgrounds are normalised to data in control regions (CRs) defined by criteria similar to those used for the SR, but with some requirements loosened or reversed to obtain signal-depleted samples enriched in the relevant backgrounds. This normalisation is done through a simultaneous fit to the signal region and all control regions, as described in section 9.1. This fit uses the complete background prediction in each region in order to account for the presence of other backgrounds and the potential small presence of signal. In particular, any background whose normalisation is determined by a control region is scaled by the same normalisation factor in all signal and control regions, not just its own control region. The following subsections describe the methods used to estimate the most important backgrounds, namely, W W , top-quark events, and W + jets, in more detail. The Drell-Yan and non-W W diboson backgrounds are small, and their predictions are computed from simulation. The small background from the Higgs boson with m H \u2248 125 GeV is also included. The predicted cross section, branching ratio, and kinematics for the SM Higgs boson are used. With few exceptions, the background estimates use the same techniques as ref. [83]. They are described there in more detail, and summarized here.",
