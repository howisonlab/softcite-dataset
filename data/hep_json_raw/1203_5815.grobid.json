We utilize several novel techniques, including multivariate lepton selection, multivariate trigger parametrization, and a multi-stage signal discriminant consisting of specialized functions trained to distinguish individual backgrounds. By increasing acceptance and enhancing signal discrimination, these techniques have significantly improved the sensitivity of the analysis above what was expected from a larger dataset alone. We observe no significant evidence for a signal, and we set limits on the ZH production cross section. For a Higgs boson with mass 115 GeV/c 2 , we expect (observe) a limit of 3.9 (4.8) times the standard model predicted value, at the 95% credibility level.",

We study data from pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV recorded by the CDF II detector. We combine two independent analyses, one with Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 [11] and one with Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [12], using data corresponding to 7.5 and 7.9 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, respectively. The CDF II detector [13] consists of silicon-based and wiredrift-chamber tracking systems immersed in a 1.4 T magnetic field for particle momentum determination. Surrounding the tracking systems are electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, providing coverage in the pseudorapidity 32 range |\u03b7| < 3.6.

We observe 33 975 events in the PT region, and expect a total background yield of 34 200 \u00b1 4800 events, where the quoted uncertainty includes both systematic and statistical contributions. We expect 13.6 \u00b1 1.1 ZH signal events in the PT region, for m H = 115 GeV/c 2 . The dominant process in the PT region is Z + light-flavor (LF) jets (u, d, s, and gluon jets), accounting for \u223c85% of the total background. Z + heavy-flavor (b and c) jets events, which contribute less than 10% of the background, are a small contribution in the PT region, but become relatively more significant in the signal regions. These processes are modeled using alpgen [21] to simulate the hard-scatter process, and pythia [22] for the subsequent hadronization. The Z + jets processes are simulated at leading order and require a K -factor of 1.4 [23] for normalization to NLO cross sections. Other small backgrounds include diboson ( Z Z , W Z, and W W ) events and tt events, simulated entirely with pythia normalized to NLO [24] and NNLO [25] predictions, respectively. Finally, other processes, such as QCD multijet production, can produce two selected leptons in the event. For muon events, this background is modeled using same-charge muon pairs from data. For electron events, we measure the rate of jets passing the electron NN using collision data to estimate the contribution from these processes. This background accounts for \u223c3% of the background in the PT region.",

The secondary vertex algorithm (SV) [26] identifies jets consistent with the decay of a long-lived b hadron by searching for displaced vertices. The SV algorithm has both a tight and a loose operating point -the loose point has better b-jet identification efficiency but also has a higher rate of jets incorrectly identified as b jets. The jet probability (JP) algorithm [27] uses track impact parameters relative to the primary vertex to construct a likelihood for all jet tracks to have originated from the primary vertex. Both algorithms have imperfect rejection of c-quark jets, allowing some events containing them to contribute to the final signal regions. We use the combination of the two highest-E T jets to form potential Higgs boson candidates. We use a hierarchy of tag combinations to define three independent signal regions. We first search for events with two tight SV tags -defining the double-tag (DT) region, the most sensitive. A second signal region includes events 34 Forward (|\u03b7| > 1.1) electrons are exempt from this requirement. with one loose SV tag and one JP tag (LJP), and the third contains events with just one tight SV tag (ST).

An uncertainty of (1, 2, 5)% is  applied to the (ST, LJP, DT) ZH samples after measuring changes in acceptance using simulated events with more or fewer particles radiated by the incoming and outgoing partons. The mistag prediction is measured using data, and carries a rate uncertainty of 14%, 27%, and 29%, for the ST, LJP, and DT tag categories, respectively. To account for differing b-jet identification efficiencies in data and simulated events, uncertainties of 5.2% (ST), 8.7% (LJP), and 10.4% (DT) are applied to the b-tagged samples. A 6% uncertainty is applied to simulated events, accounting for uncertainty in the measurement of integrated luminosity. The trigger model applied to simulated events requires a 5% normalization uncertainty. We also apply uncertainties on the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency (1%) and lepton energy measurement (1.5%). For muons (electrons), we measure a 5% (50%) uncertainty on the normalization of the remaining background processes, based on differences in the rates of events containing same-charge and opposite-charge lepton pairs and in the rates of jets misidentified as electrons.",

Each simulated experiment produces an upper limit on the ZH production cross section. The median of the 95% CL upper limits from the simulated experiments is taken to be the expected 95% CL upper limit of the analysis.
