A seasonal modulation with a period of (366.3 \u00b1 0.6) d and a relative amplitude of (1.36 \u00b1 0.04)% is observed. The phase is measured to be (181.7 \u00b1 0.4) d, corresponding to a maximum at the 1 st of July. Using data inferred from global atmospheric models, we show the muon flux to be positively correlated with the atmospheric temperature and measure the effective temperature coefficient \u03b1 T = 0.90 \u00b1 0.02. The origin of cosmic muons from pion and kaon decays in the atmosphere allows to interpret the effective temperature coefficient as an indirect measurement of the atmospheric kaon-topion production ratio r K/\u03c0 = 0.11 +0.11   \u22120.07 for primary energies above 18 TeV. We find evidence for a long-term modulation of the muon flux with a period of \u223c 3000 d and a maximum in June 2012 that is not present in the atmospheric temperature data. A possible correlation between this modulation and the solar activity is investigated. The cosmogenic neutron production rate is found to show a seasonal modulation in phase with the cosmic muon flux but with an increased amplitude of (2.6 \u00b1 0.4)%.",

            "text": "Cosmic muons are produced mainly in the decays of kaons and pions that originate from the interaction of primary cosmic rays with nuclei in the upper atmosphere [1]. For detectors situated deep underground, the flux of cosmic muons is strongly reduced. Only muons surpassing a certain threshold energy E thr contribute, while lower energy muons are absorbed in the rock overburden. At great depths, the residual high energy muons must have been produced by parent mesons that decay in flight without any inelastic interactions and without elastic interactions of large momentum transfer before the decay. As a consequence, the density and temperature variations of the upper atmosphere that alter the mean free path of the decaying mesons introduce, in first approximation, a seasonal modulation of the underground muon flux, which has been investigated for many decades [2]. Several experiments located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy such as MACRO [3], LVD [4,5], Borexino [6], and GERDA [7] and at other experimental sites, e.g. IceCube [8], MINOS [9], Double Chooz [10], or Daya Bay [11], have studied this phenomenon. Compared to the previously published investigation based on four years of Borexino data acquired between 2007 and 2011 [6], the present analysis of ten years of data from 2007 to 2017 achieves a significantly better precision on the muon flux, on the modulation parameters, and on the effective temperature coefficient. In addition, we expand the former analysis by measuring the atmospheric kaon-to-pion production ratio, observe a long-term modulation of the cosmic muon flux, investigate a possible correlation between this modulation and the solar activity, and measure the seasonal modulation of the cosmogenic neutron production rate.",

It is designed for the spectroscopy of low energy solar neutrinos that are detected via elastic scattering off electrons. Based on the data acquired after the start of data taking in May 2007, Borexino accomplished measurements of the solar 7 Be [13][14][15][16], 8 B [17,18], pep [15,19], and pp neutrino fluxes [15,20]. The complete spectroscopy of neutrinos from the pp-chain performed with Borexino is now available in [21]. In addition, a limit on the flux of solar neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle [15,19] and a spectroscopic measurement of antineutrinos produced in radioactive decays within the Earth, the so-called geo-neutrinos [22][23][24], were performed. Investigating the background to the neutrino analyses, Borexino further performed detailed studies of high energy cosmic muons as well as of cosmogenic neutrons and radioactive isotopes from muon spallation on the detector materials [25].",

It consists of a central organic scintillator target of 278 t composed of the solvent PC (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) doped with the wavelength shifter PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole) at a concentration of 1.5 g/l. The scintillator mixture is contained in a spherical and transparent nylon Inner Vessel (IV) with a diameter of 8.5 m and a thickness of 125 \u00b5m. To shield this central target from external \u03b3-ray backgrounds and to absorb emanating radon, the IV is surrounded by two layers of buffer liquid in which the light quencher DMP (dimethylphthalate) is added to the scintillator solvent. A Stainless Steel Sphere (SSS) of 13.7 m diameter holding 2212 inward-facing 8\" E.T.L. 9351 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that detect the scintillation light caused by particle interactions in the central region completes the ID. The ID is embedded in a steel dome of 18 m diameter and 16.9 m height that is filled with 2.1 kt of ultra-pure water. Through the instrumentation of the outer surface of the SSS and the floor of the water tank with 208 PMTs, this Outer Detector (OD) provides an extremely efficient detection and tracking of cosmic muons via the Cherenkov light that is emitted during their passage through the water [27].",

Since the higher temperature in summer lowers the average density of the atmosphere, the probability that the muon-producing mesons decay in flight before their first virtual interaction is increased due to their longer mean free paths. Only muons produced in these decays obtain enough energy to penetrate the rock coverage and reach the Borexino detector.

(3.1). The period is fixed to one year as shown in figure 3. While we obtain unchanged results on the mean muon flux and the amplitude of the modulation, the phase of the strictly seasonal modulation is found to be t 0 = (181.7 \u00b1 0.4) d, corresponding to a maximum on the 1 st of July. We consider this as our final estimate of the phase of the seasonal modulation. Especially in winter and spring, clear deviations from the sinusoidal assumption of the fit may be observed that can be attributed to a more turbulent environment of the upper atmosphere due to, e.g., stratospheric warmings [30]. Thus, the reduced \u03c7 2 of the fit is \u03c7 2 /NDF = 13702/362. To check the result, we selected a sample of muons as identified by the MTF and performed the same analysis steps.

For this analysis, we use the temperature for the location at 42.75 \u2022 N and 13.5 \u2022 E, which is the closest grid point to the LNGS available. The model provides atmospheric temperature data at 37 discrete pressure levels in the range from [0-1000] hPa four times per day at 00.00 h, 06.00 h, 12.00 h, and 18.00 h. Based on these data, we calculated T eff for each of the temperature sets based on eq. (4.1). The effective atmospheric temperature T eff of the respective day was computed as the average of the four values calculated during the day, their variance was used to estimate the uncertainty. Figure 5 shows the mean effective atmospheric temperature in a weekly binning. Analogously to the cosmic muon flux, the modulation parameters were inferred by a fit to the data in a daily binning. A fit similar to eq. additional secondary maxima in winter and spring are observed. These maxima may be ascribed to stratospheric warmings [30]. Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW) sometimes even feature amplitudes comparable to the leading seasonal modulation [33], as visible e.g. in winter 2016/2017.",

We obtain \u03b1 T = 0.90 \u00b1 0.02 stat. in agreement with the former Borexino result of \u03b1 T = 0.93 \u00b1 0.04 stat. [6] but with the statistical uncertainties reduced by a factor \u223c 2. In order to analyze systematic uncertainties, we performed the following checks: 1We repeated the analysis selecting muons with our alternative muon identification method MTF. An effective temperature coefficient \u03b1 T (MTF) = 0.92 \u00b1 0.02 stat. is measured in agreement with the above result. (2) We allowed for an offset in eq. (4.3) and fit the data. The fit provides an intercept \u03b1 0 = \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.03 consistent with zero, meaning that no obvious offsets or non-linearities are observed. (3) We performed the analysis for a two-year moving subset. We find the result to be stable and consistent with the full data set without any fluctuations above the statistical expectations. We conclude that any systematic uncertainty must be small compared to the statistical uncertainty obtained from the fit.",

E thr cos(\u03b8) is the product of the threshold energy for a muon arriving from a zenith angle \u03b8 at the detector and the cosine of this angle. The mean value of this product allows to properly parametrize and compare the depths of various underground sites taking into account that the threshold energy is direction-dependent due to the shape of the respective rock overburden. Figure 8 shows the weighted mean of \u03b1 T for measurements performed at the LNGS together with measurements at other underground laboratories from Barrett [2], IceCube [8], MINOS [9], Double Chooz [10], Daya Bay [11], and AMANDA [35]. The experimental results are plotted as a function of E thr cos \u03b8 , which is the parameter on which \u03b1 T explicitly depends (eq. (7.5)-(7.6)). The insert shows the LNGS based measurements from MACRO [3], LVD [5], GERDA [7], and the two Borexino measurements from 2012 [6] and from this work. For the LNGS, a value of E thr cos \u03b8 = (1.34 \u00b1 0.18) TeV has been calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation (see below). The red line shows the expected \u03b1 T as a function of E thr cos \u03b8 considering muon production using the literature value of the atmospheric kaonto-pion ratio of r K/\u03c0 = 0.149 \u00b1 0.06 [36], the dashed and dotted lines illustrate the extreme cases of pure pion or pure kaon production, respectively. The green line indicates the result of a fit to the measurements according to eq. (7.5) with r K/\u03c0 as a free parameter. We obtain r K/\u03c0 = 0.08 \u00b1 0.02 stat. at a \u03c7 2 /NDF = 5/9. However, note that systematic uncertainties like the exact value of E thr cos \u03b8 for the respective experimental sites are not fully determined and this result is only indicative. Also, the measured values of \u03b1 T depend on the assumed kaon-to-pion ratio since this quantity is included in the computation of T eff .

We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the expected JCAP02(2019)046 value of \u03b1 T at the location of the LNGS depending on r K/\u03c0 . For muons with an energy E \u00b5 \u226b \u01eb \u03c0 , which is true for the muons arriving at the LNGS, the zenith angle distribution is best described by sec \u03b8 for \u03b8 < 70 \u2022 instead of the usual cos 2 \u03b8 [37]. We generated a toy Monte Carlo set of muons by randomly drawing a zenith angle from this distribution and an energy from the distribution given by eq. (7.2) for the respective \u03b8. Moreover, a random azimuth angle \u03c6 was selected and the rock coverage D(\u03b8, \u03c6) for muons arriving from this direction was calculated based on an altitude profile of the Gran Sasso mountains obtained from the Google Maps Elevation API [38] and the density of the Gran Sasso rock of \u03c1 = (2.71\u00b10.05) g/cm 3 [39]. We converted this into a direction dependent threshold energy E thr (\u03b8, \u03c6) for surface muons to reach the LNGS using the energy loss formula given in [37] with fixed parameters. For r K/\u03c0 values increasing from 0 to 0.3 in steps of 0.01, we calculate the corresponding mean value of the effective temperature coefficient \u03b1 T for samples of 10000 muons with E \u00b5 > E thr (\u03b8, \u03c6).",

We considered contributions from a 5% uncertainty of the altitude profile, the uncertainty of the measured rock density of the Gran Sasso rock of 0.05 g/cm 3   of the measurement of the muon spectral index of 0.05 [34], the uncertainties of the critical meson energies \u2206\u01eb \u03c0 = 3 GeV and \u2206\u01eb K = 14 GeV, and a 10% uncertainty of the drawn zenith angle. For the combined systematic uncertainty of \u03b1 T , we found \u223c 0.015. However, the strength of several of the contributions coming from the above factors depends on r K/\u03c0 . In particular, the larger uncertainty of \u01eb K compared to \u01eb \u03c0 leads to an increasing uncertainty of \u03b1 T with rising r K/\u03c0 . This simulation was used as well to calculate E thr cos \u03b8 = (1.34 \u00b1 0.18) TeV for the location of the LNGS. Also this value agrees with the result of E thr cos \u03b8 = (1.30 \u00b1 0.16) TeV we obtained using the MUSIC/MUSUN simulation inputs. Figure 9 shows the experimental and theoretical values of \u03b1 T as functions of r K/\u03c0 . The experimental value of \u03b1 T has a weak dependence on r K/\u03c0 since it enters into the calculation of the effective temperature T eff . To investigate this dependence, we calculated the daily T eff for the same range of r K/\u03c0 values as above and redetermined \u03b1 T for each set of T eff values via the correlation to the measured muon flux as in section 6. The resulting dependence is very weak and strongly overpowered by the statistical uncertainties of the measurements. Finally, to determine the kaon-to-pion production ratio, we estimate the intersection of the two allowed \u03b1 T bands to obtain a value of r K/\u03c0 = 0.11 +0.11 \u22120.07 . The allowed region in r K/\u03c0 and \u03b1 T has been determined by adding the \u03c7 2 profiles of the Borexino measurement and the theoretical prediction.",

Results of many older measurements using various reactions are summarized and referred to in [44]. The theoretical uncertainty of the kaon-to-pion ratio in current cosmic ray models is of the order of 40% [36]. Even though the indirect measurements do not directly compare with the accelerator experiments since the latter are performed with fixed beam energies, the central values are consistent as shown in figure 10. We place the Borexino data point in figure 10 at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = (190 \u00b1 28) GeV, calculated assuming an average collision of a primary 18 TeV proton on a fixed nucleon target. The proton energy is chosen to be ten times the mean threshold energy E thr = (1.8 \u00b1 0.2) TeV we computed using the MUSIC/MUSUN inputs in our simulation, given that cosmic muons with E > 1 TeV obtain on average one tenth of the energy of the primary cosmic ray particle [1]. Due to the broad energy range of contributing muons, uncertainties on the center-of-mass energy need to be considered for the indirect measurements. Our result agrees with former indirect and direct measurements. Note that while the indirect measurements feature larger uncertainties than the accelerator experiments, they may infer the atmospheric kaon-to-pion ratio using cosmic ray data. Due to the smaller muon statistics at greater depths, our measurement uncertainty is larger than for the MINOS and IceCube results. However, Borexino contributes the data point at the highest center-of-mass energy for indirect as well as fixed target measurements.",

However, it is known that the LS method may identify harmonics of the leading modulation as significant [48]. Therefore, only the highest significance peak can be safely regarded as physical. In order to clarify if the long-term modulation is physical, we subtract the seasonal modulation as in eq. (3.1) with the parameters returned by the fit described in section 3.

To investigate the possibility of such a correlation, we perform a LS analysis of the daily sunspot data provided by the World Data Center SILSO, the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels [51] for the timeframe corresponding to the cosmic muon data acquired by Borexino as shown in figure 14. Since individual solar cycles are known to have significantly varied periods, it is not sensible to use a data set including earlier sunspot data. In figure 15, the most significant peak in the LS periodogram occurs at a period of \u223c 3000 d, in coincidence with the long-term modulation of the cosmic muon flux. The significance level of 99.5% was calculated following the procedure outlined in section 8. Further modulation periods are found to be significant in the sunspot data. This is expected since several authors observed minor modulations in the solar activity besides the solar cycle (see [52] and refs. therein). Also the increase in LS powers towards very high periods is expected since solar activity modulations larger than the solar cycle have been observed.",

Beyond a neutron multiplicity of 10, we are unable to observe the seasonal modulation applying the LS periodogram. The observed phase is in good agreement with the seasonal modulation of the entire cosmic muon flux. However, we find the amplitude of the modulation to be higher with a difference of about 2\u03c3 compared to the relative amplitude of (1.36 \u00b1 0.04)% measured for the entire cosmic muon flux in section 3. Table 3 lists the phase and amplitude of the seasonal modulation measured for the number of neutron-producing muons as well as for the neutron production rate applying increasingly high neutron multiplicity cuts. Consistent results are found for all samples with neutron multiplicities n \u2264 10 beyond which the modulation is no longer significant in the LS periodogram. We find the phase of the cosmogenic neutron production rate to agree with the muon flux. Correspondingly, the maximum occurs approximately one month later than expected for dark matter particles. However, the amplitude of the modulation is higher compared to the muon flux's, independently of the multiplicity cut that was actually applied. To further probe this effect, we computed the average cosmogenic neutron production and neutron-producing muon rates in three summer months and three winter months for each data set. We inferred the amplitude by assuming a sinusoidal modulation around the mean of the two values. The amplitudes observed following this residual approach are listed in the last column of table 3. We find consistent values to the ones obtained from the fit in each data sample confirming the increased modulation amplitude.",
