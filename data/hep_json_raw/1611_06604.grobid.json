The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-ofmass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . Final states with two photons and significant missing transverse energy are used to search for supersymmetric particles in models of supersymmetry (SUSY) with general gauge-mediated (GGM) supersymmetry breaking. No excess is observed with respect to the standard model expectation, and the results are used to set limits on gluino pair production and squark pair production in the GGM SUSY framework. Gluino masses below 1.65 TeV and squark masses below 1.37 TeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Final states in proton-proton collisions containing photons with high transverse momentum p T and significant missing transverse energy E miss T emerge naturally from a variety of new-physics scenarios, particularly in models of supersymmetry (SUSY) broken via gauge mediation that require a stable, weakly interacting lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The E miss T in an event, defined as the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all visible particles, is a consequence of undetected particles such as neutrinos or LSPs. Models with general gauge mediation (GGM) [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] can have a wide range of features, but typically entail a nearly massless gravitino LSP, G, and a next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) often taken to be a neutralino \u03c7 0 1 . Photons in the final state arise when the neutralino decays to a gravitino and a photon, \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 G\u03b3 .",

A sample of Z \u2192 ee events for additional studies was collected with a trigger nearly identical to the diphoton trigger, but with an invariant mass requirement M ee > 70 GeV and with the additional requirement that both electromagnetic (EM) objects be matched to a pixel detector seed (at least two measurements in the pixel detector consistent with a track from a charged particle).

From the NLO+NLL predicted cross sections and their uncertainties we derive contours representing lower limits in the SUSY mass plane. We also show expected limit contours based on the expected experimental cross section limits and their uncertainties. For typical values of the neutralino mass, we expect to exclude gluino masses up to 1.60 TeV and squark masses up to 1.35 TeV, and we observe exclusions of 1.65 and 1.37 TeV respectively. The excluded mass ranges for gluino pair production have been improved by approximately 300 GeV ",

In both models, the branching fraction of the NLSP neutralino to decay to a gravitino and a photon is assumed to be unity. Using background estimation methods based on control samples in data, limits are determined on the gluino and squark pair production cross sections, and those limits are used together with NLO+NLL cross section calculations to constrain the masses of gluinos, squarks, and neutralinos. Gluino masses below 1.65 TeV and squark masses below 1.37 TeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level. This represents an improvement of approximately 300 GeV with respect to previous analyses performed at a centerof-mass energy of 8 TeV [15,16] and is consistent with the results of the ATLAS analysis performed at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV [17].",
