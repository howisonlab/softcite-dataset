A signature of two jets and either two same sign electrons or a same sign electron-muon pair is searched for using 19.7 fb \u22121 of data collected during 2012 in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the expected standard model (SM) background and, in the context of a Type-1 seesaw mechanism, upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction for production of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the mass range between 40 and 500 GeV. The results are additionally interpreted as limits on the mixing between the heavy Majorana neutrinos and the SM neutrinos. In the mass range considered, the upper limits range between 0.00015-0.72 for |V eN | 2 and 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 -0.47 for",

            "text": "The discovery of neutrino oscillations established that neutrinos have non-zero masses and hints at possible physics beyond the standard model (SM). Results from various neutrino oscillation experiments together with cosmological constraints imply very small neutrino masses [1]. The leading model that naturally generates light neutrino masses is the socalled \"seesaw\" mechanism, which can be realized in several different schemes [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. In the simplest model, the smallness of the observed neutrino masses is due to a heavy neutrino state N. In this model the SM neutrino mass is given by m \u03bd \u223c y 2 \u03bd v 2 /m N , where y \u03bd is a Yukawa coupling, v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value in the SM, and m N is the mass of the heavy neutrino state. If the seesaw mechanism were to explain the masses of the known neutrinos, both the light and the heavy neutrinos would have to be Majorana particles, so processes that violate lepton number conservation by two units would be JHEP04 (2016)169possible. Therefore, searches for heavy Majorana neutrinos using hadron colliders are very important in resolving the nature of neutrinos and the origin of neutrino masses.",

The missing transverse momentum vector is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . Jets are reconstructed by forming clusters of particle-flow candidates based on the anti-k T algorithm [44], with a distance parameter of 0.5. Standard jet identification procedures are applied to suppress jets from calorimeter noise and beam halo. Contributions from pileup are estimated using the jet area method [45,46] and are subtracted from the jet p T . The energy of reconstructed jets is corrected based on the results of simulation and data studies [47].",

Since prompt leptons from W or Z decays tend to have high probability to pass the tight lepton requirements, any contamination of these prompt leptons in the measurement sample can bias the misidentification probabilities. To prevent this, a number of cuts are applied to remove these prompt leptons: only one lepton is allowed and upper thresholds on missing transverse -9 -JHEP04 (2016)169energy (E miss T < 20 GeV) and the transverse mass (m T < 25 GeV) are applied, where m T is calculated using the lepton p T and E miss T . These requirements suppress contamination from W and Z boson decays. The loose lepton and jet are also required to be separated in azimuth by \u2206\u03c6 > 2.5. This jet is used as a tag and the loose lepton as a probe used to determine the misidentification probability. The transverse energy of the tag jet is an essential ingredient to calibrate the characteristics of the probe (loose lepton). It is determined from MC simulations that the signal region is well modelled by a requirement of p T > 40 GeV on the tag jet, and therefore this is used to select the measurement sample.",

The overall systematic uncertainty in this background is determined by varying the background estimate with respect to the isolation requirement for the loose leptons and by varying the p T requirement for the tag jet. Increasing and decreasing the p T requirement for the tag jet changes the p T spectrum of the recoiling lepton in the event and is found to have the largest impact on the background level. As a result, the 35-40% overall systematic uncertainty in the misidentified lepton background estimate is dominated by the p T requirement on the tag jet. For backgrounds from mismeasured electron charge an overall systematic uncertainty is assigned to the background of 12%.
