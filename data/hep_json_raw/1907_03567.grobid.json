            "text": "The processes that produce W and Z bosons 1 in pp collisions via Drell-Yan annihilation are two of the simplest at hadron colliders to describe theoretically. At lowest order in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), W -boson production proceeds via qq \u2192 W and Z -boson production via qq \u2192 Z . Therefore, precision measurements of these production cross-sections yield important information about the parton distribution functions (PDFs) for quarks inside the proton. Factorisation theory allows PDFs to be treated separately from the perturbative QCD high-scale collision calculation as functions of the event energy scale, Q, and the momentum fraction of the parton, x, for each parton flavour. Usually PDFs are defined for a particular starting scale Q 0 and can be evolved to other scales via the DGLAP equations [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Measurements of onshell W/Z -boson production probe the PDFs in a range of Q 2 that lies close to m 2 W/Z . The range of x that is probed depends on the centre-of-mass energy, \u221a s, of the protons and the rapidity coverage of the detector. Each measurement of these production cross-sections at a new value of \u221a s thus provides information complementary to previous measurements. The combinations of initial partons participating in the production processes of W + ,W \u2212 , and Z bosons are different, so each process provides complementary information about the products of different quark PDFs.",

The momentum vector of each cluster is determined by the magnitude and coordinates of the energy deposits; the cluster is assumed to be massless. Cluster energies are initially measured assuming that the energy deposition occurs only through EM interactions, and are then corrected for the different calorimeter responses to hadrons and electromagnetically interacting particles, for losses due to dead material, and for energy that is not captured by the clustering process [59]. The definition of the recoil does not make use of reconstructed jets, to avoid threshold effects. The procedure used to calibrate the recoil closely follows   The Z -boson selection requires events to contain exactly two lepton candidates with the same flavour and opposite charge. At least one lepton must match a lepton candidate that met the trigger criteria.

This is achieved by constructing a shape template for the background using a discriminating variable in a control region and then performing a template fit to the same distribution in the signal region to extract the background contribution. The choice of template variable is motivated by the difference between signal and background and by the available number of events.

Additional candidates can arise from 'non-prompt' electrons produced when a photon converts, and in decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. To construct a control region for the multijet template, a selection is used that differs from the W -boson selection described in Sect. 4 in only two respects: the medium electron identification criteria are inverted (while keeping the looser identification criteria) and the E miss T requirement is removed. By construction, this control region is statistically independent of the W -boson signal region. A template for the shape of the multijet background in the E miss T distribution is then obtained from that distribution in the control region after subtraction of expected contributions from the signal and other backgrounds determined using MC samples. The normalisation of the multijet background template in the signal region is extracted by performing a \u03c7 2 fit of the E miss T distribution (applying all signal criteria except the requirement on E miss T ) to a sum of the templates for the multijet background, the signal, and all other backgrounds. The normalisation of the signal is allowed to vary freely in the fit as is the multijet background; however, the other backgrounds are only allowed to vary from their expected values by up to 5%, corresponding to the largest level of variation in predicted electroweakboson production cross-sections obtained from varying the choice of PDF. The normalisation from this fit can then be used together with the inverted selection to construct multijet background distributions in any other variable that is not correlated with the electron identification criteria.",

It is defined as the fraction of generated events that satisfy the fiducial requirements. This acceptance is determined using MC signal samples, corrected to the generator QED Born level, and is used to extrapolate the measured cross-section in the fiducial region to the full phase space. The central values of A W,Z are around 0.6 for these measurements, compared with 0.5 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 0.4 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, so the fiducial region is closer to the full phase space in this measurement than for those at higher centre-of-mass energies. This is due to a combination of higher p T thresholds for leptons in other measurements, and more-central production of vector bosons at lower \u221a s.  after having established that the central values of the efficiencies are the same for different centre-of-mass energies when the same LAr filter settings are used. A similar methodology had been used for internal estimates of the electron efficiency performance at 13 TeV before the start of Run-2 data taking and was found to give a good prediction of the efficiencies in data as well as a conservative estimate of the uncertainties. Transverse-momentum-dependent isolation corrections, calculated with the tag-and-probe method in 2.76 TeV data, are very close to 1, so the systematic uncertainty in the electron isolation requirement is set to the size of the correction itself, that is \u00b11% for low p T and \u00b10.3% for higher p T . The electron energy scale has associated statistical uncertainties and systematic uncertainties arising from a possible bias in the calibration method, the choice of generator, the presampler energy scale, and imperfect knowledge of the material in front of the EM calorimeter [62]. The total energy-scale uncertainty is calculated as the sum in quadrature of these components.",

The scale normalisation uncertainty from the \u03c7 2 fit is approximately \u00b113% for the W \u2192 e\u03bd channel. This uncertainty is neglected in the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel where the template bias is dominant. The mismodelling uncertainty is estimated by comparison of the fit results for + and \u2212 , and for the combined \u00b1 candidates. The central value used is 0.5N \u00b1 with the uncertainties N + \u2212 0.5N \u00b1 and N \u2212 \u2212 0.5N \u00b1 , where N + is the fitted number of + background events, N \u2212 is the fitted number of \u2212 and N \u00b1 is the fitted total number of \u00b1 background events. In the W \u2192 e\u03bd channel this leads to an uncertainty of \u00b128% in the multijet background. In the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel the multijet template normalisation is derived from the fit in the small-m T region, where electroweak contributions are negligible and there are many data events, and this source of systematic error is found to be negligible. The fit-bias uncertainty arising from the choice of bin width is estimated by repeating the fit with different binnings. This component is negligible in the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd case and \u00b115% in the W \u2192 e\u03bd case. The uncertainty due to a potential bias from template choice is estimated by employing different template selections. For the W \u2192 e\u03bd channel, different inverted-isolation criteria were investigated. The overall differences are considered negligible. For the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel, template vari-  Combining results and building ratios or asymmetries of results require a model for the correlations of particular systematic uncertainties between different measurements. Correlations arise mostly due to the fact that electrons, muons, and the recoil are reconstructed identically in the different measurements. Further correlations occur due to similarities in the analysis methodology such as the methods of signal and background estimation. A simplified form of the correlation model with the grouped list of the sources of systematic errors is presented in Table 4.",

These calculations allow kinematic requirements to be implemented for direct comparison with experimental data. The procedure used follows that used for the previous ATLAS measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV [10]. Corrections for NLO EW effects are calculated with Fewz 3.1 [69][70][71][72], for the Z bosons and with Sanc [73,74] for the W bosons. The calculation was done in the G \u03bc EW scheme [75]. The following input parameters are taken from the Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Properties 2014 edition [76]: the Fermi constant, the masses and widths of W and Z bosons as well as the elements of the CKM matrix. The cross-sections for vector bosons decaying into these leptonic final states are calculated such that they match the definition of the measured cross-sections in the data. Thus, from complete NLO EW corrections, the following components are included: virtual QED and weak corrections, real initialstate radiation (ISR), and interference between ISR and real final-state radiation (FSR) [77]. The calculated effect of these corrections on the cross-sections is (\u22120.26\u00b10.02)% for \u03c3 fid W + , (\u22120.21 \u00b1 0.03)% for \u03c3 fid W \u2212 , and (\u22120.25 \u00b1 0.12)% for \u03c3 fid Z . Dynnlo is used for the central values of the predictions while Fewz is used for the PDF variations and all other systematic variations such as QCD scale and \u03b1 s . The predictions are calculated using the CT14nnlo [78], NNPDF3.1 [79], MMHT14nnlo68cl [80], ABMP16 [81], HERAPDF2.0 [82],    Theoretical uncertainties in the predictions are also derived from the following sources: PDF: these uncertainties are evaluated from the variations of the NNLO PDFs according to the recommended procedure for each PDF set. A table with all PDF uncertainties and their central values is shown in Appendix A; the PDF uncertainty from CT14nnlo was rescaled from 90% CL to 68% CL. Scales: the scale uncertainties are defined by the envelope of the variations in which the scales are changed by factors of two subject to the constraint 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc R /\u03bc F \u2264 2. \u03b1 s : the uncertainty due to \u03b1 s was estimated by varying the value of \u03b1 s used in the CT14nnlo PDF set by \u00b10.001, corresponding to a 68% CL variation.",

Uncertainties shown as \u00b10.ations were estimated from fits that use bb + cc MC samples as the multijet templates, leading to an uncertainty of \u00b175%; this is the largest uncertainty in the multijet background in the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel.",
