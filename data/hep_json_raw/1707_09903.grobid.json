Due to its location near the surface, a good understanding of cosmic muons as a source of backgrounds is of fundamental importance for the experiment. We present a method of using an external 0.5 m (L) x 0.5 m (W) muon counter stack, installed above the main detector, to determine the cosmic-ray reconstruction efficiency in MicroBooNE. Data are acquired with this external muon counter stack placed in three different positions, corresponding to cosmic rays intersecting different parts of the detector. The data reconstruction efficiency of tracks in the detector is found to be data = (97.1 \u00b1 0.1 (stat) \u00b1 1.4 (sys))%, in good agreement with the Monte Carlo reconstruction efficiency MC = (97.4 \u00b1 0.1)%. This analysis represents a small-scale demonstration of the method that can be used with future data coming from a recently installed cosmic-ray tagger system, which will be able to tag \u2248 80% of the cosmic rays passing through the MicroBooNE detector.",

The cathode, made of a plane of stainless steel panels, operates at a voltage a Kalman filter for track fitting. All hits that are associated with through-going tracks in either (or both) algorithms are tagged as cosmogenic tracks and are removed. The neutrino pass can then be run on the remaining hits. Further cosmic removal is performed downstream of the reconstruction using the optical system (see, for example, reference [3]).  The orientation of the axes in the following plots is standard in LArSoft, and makes a right handed co-ordinate system: the x coordinate (256.35 cm) points along the negative drift direction with 0 placed at the anode plane, y (233 cm) points vertically upward with 0 at the center of the detector, and z (1036.8 cm) points along the direction of the beam, with 0 at the upstream edge of the detector.

In a neutrino interaction, a neutrino from the beam interacts with an argon nucleus, and the secondary charged particles traverse the medium, losing energy and leaving an ionization trail. The resulting ionization electrons drift to the wire planes under an electric field of 273 V/cm. The distance between the cathode and anode is 2.56 m. An ionization electron takes about 2.3 ms to travel the full drift distance, called the drift time window. Charge drifting past a wire plane induces a current that produces a bipolar signal in the electronics. The first two planes are referred to as induction planes. The wire plane furthest from the cathode has wires oriented vertically. Drifting electrons are collected on this plane producing a unipolar signal. Charge deposited in the TPC generates a signal used to create three distinct two-dimensional views (in terms of wire and time) of the event, which can be combined to reconstruct a three-dimensional image of the interaction. A set of 32 photomultipliers tubes (PMTs) is placed behind the anode plane to collect the argon scintillation light. Scintillation light provides timing information with few-ns precision, which provides the TPC start time of the event and can be used for background suppression.

In the future, the method described in this paper will be applied to the data coming from the cosmic ray tagger (CRT) system [4], installed in March 2017. It is able to tag approximately 80% of the cosmic rays traversing the MicroBooNE LArTPC, which is an order of magnitude more than the coverage provided by the MuCS.

Measuring the reconstruction efficiency of such cosmic rays in the detector is of fundamental importance for the assessment of the detector performance and the suppression of cosmic-ray background. We present results using data from a small muon counter (the MuCS), placed above the MicroBooNE TPC, to measure the data reconstruction efficiency and compare it with the Monte Carlo reconstruction efficiency. A method to evaluate the number of reconstructed MuCS cosmic rays is studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation.  The data reconstruction efficiency, calculated by comparing the number of MuCS-triggered events with the number of events with a reconstructed MuCS cosmic ray, is measured as a function of the cosmic-ray starting angles \u03b8, \u03c6 and the expected length in the TPC, L. The overall reconstruction efficiency obtained is data = (97.1 \u00b1 0.1 (stat) \u00b1 1.4 (sys))% and MC = (97.4 \u00b1 0.1 (stat))% for data and Monte Carlo, respectively.

Other systematic uncertainties, such as the ones related to the space-charge effect and the energy sampling, were found to be negligible with the present level of statistics. This article describes a proof of principle method of using an external muon counter to measure the cosmic-ray reconstruction efficiency in a LArTPC. The (\u03b8, \u03c6, L) parameter space covered by the MuCS will be significantly expanded using the data coming from a larger cosmic ray tagger system (CRT), installed in March 2017, as illustrated in figure 12. This detector will be able to tag \u224880% of the cosmic rays hitting the TPC and study the presence of non-uniformities in a larger portion of the MicroBooNE detector. The data coming from the CRT will allow the measurement of efficiency-corrected quantities, such as the cosmic-ray flux, and the reconstruction efficiencies will be directly applicable to physics measurements.
