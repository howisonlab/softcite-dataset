Using the 'wrong-sign muon' signal to measure \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 ) oscillations in a 50 ktonne Magnetised Iron Neutrino Detector (MIND) sensitivity to \u03b4 CP could be maintained down to small values of \u03b8 13 . However, the detector efficiencies used in previous studies were calculated assuming perfect pattern recognition. In this paper, MIND is re-assessed taking into account, for the first time, a realistic pattern recognition for the muon candidate. Reoptimisation of the analysis utilises a combination of methods, including a multivariate analysis similar to the one used in MINOS, to maintain high efficiency while suppressing backgrounds, ensuring that the signal selection efficiency and the background levels are comparable or better than the ones in previous analyses.",

            "text": "The concept of a neutrino beam from the decay of muons in a storage ring was first proposed in 1980 [1]. More recently, such a facility was explored as a preliminary stage towards a muon collider and was renamed \"Neutrino Factory\". Its physics potential was originally described by Geer [2]. The great advantage of a Neutrino Factory over conventional neutrino beams from pion decay is that the decay of muons is very well described by the Standard Model and so the beam flux is easily calculable. Therefore, it is possible to perform high precision neutrino oscillation experiments at a high flux Neutrino Factory. Another significant feature of a Neutrino Factory is that one can accelerate muons of both signs into a storage ring, thereby enabling study of both neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations with equal flux, vastly improving sensitivity to CP violation in the neutrino sector. For a more recent review see [3].",

Incorrect charge assignment (charge misidentification) of non-oscillated \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions present a significant possible background in this beam configuation, in addition to backgrounds from meson decays in the hadronic shower and misidentification of Neutral Current (NC) and \u03bd e CC events. This current study re-visits the problem by taking an un-biased look at the visible part of a large sample of neutrino interactions -generated using the same GEANT3 [15] simulation as in the above mentioned studies with a uniform distribution in neutrino energy -and developing pattern recognition algorithms (first presented in [16]) -described in Sec. 3 -to extract a candidate muon for fitting using a Kalman filter. Successful fits are then subject to offline analyses -described in Sec. 4 -to determine the validity of those wrong sign candidates. Analysis results are presented in Sec 5.",

While the shortening of the event has the potential to reduce backgrounds from NC and \u03bd e CC as there should be less viable candidates, viable signal can also be lost, with a corresponding increase in charge misidentification background. Therefore, it is recomendable to apply a fiducial volume cut so that these pathologies are minimised. Specifically, events are rejected should their candidate have both its first hit within 50 cm of the sides or back of the detector and its last within 10 cm. In sec. 5.1.3, the edge effects and their suppression are presented using \u03bd \u00b5 CC events as a model since they should affect little or no increase on NC and \u03bd e CC backgrounds and any small variation should be of the same spectral form as those seen in \u03bd \u00b5 CC events.",

            "text": "Compared to the baseline MIND presented in [9], where perfect pattern recognition was assumed, these new results show some improvement. The aforementioned study considered the charge and NC backgrounds and in both cases the results presented here are of similar level. The signal efficiency curve reaches a plateau at 70% in the bin of 6 \u2212 7 GeV. The corresponding curve in the previous study reaches approximately the same level at a similar or slightly higher energy depending on the particular analysis. Using this efficiency curve, Neutrino Factory sensitivity studies were carried out in the context of the International Scoping Study (ISS) for a future neutrino facility [29], demonstrating that a NF with two 50 ktonne MIND detectors at two different baselines has the largest \u03b8 13 \u2212 \u03b4 CP coverage out of all possible facilities. This paper reinforces the conclusions from that study by showing that the pattern recognition and reconstruction of events in MIND do not degrade the selection efficiency for the oscillated signal.
