            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics, top quarks can be produced either in top-antitop pairs via the strong interaction or as single top quarks by the electroweak interaction. Top quarks decay (in the SM) almost exclusively to a W boson and a b quark. Therefore, the decay signature depends solely on the W, decaying either leptonically into lepton+neutrino l\u03bd or hadronically into quarkantiquark qq. In general, cross sections are lower and backgrounds higher for single top quark production compared to top pairs making analyses more difficult. Therefore, single top production was established only in recent years at the Tevatron. At the higher centre-of-mass energy at the LHC, cross sections are larger for the different production channels, leading to higher statistics. Figure 1 shows examples of Feynman diagrams for t-channel, associated W boson production (Wt-channel) and s-channel single top production. Table 1 lists the cross sections at Next-to-leading order (NLO) with Next-to-next-to-leading-log (NNLL) resummation (NNLO approximation) for Tevatron and LHC centre-of-mass energies [1][2][3]. Cross sections at the LHC are between about 4 and 30 times larger than at the Tevatron. Especially the Wt-channel, which was not accessible before, has a significant cross section at the LHC. Even the s-channel cross section, the smallest one at the LHC, is more than two times larger than the largest one at the Tevatron. This allows detailed measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena in the coming years. The different production channels will be established, their cross sections compared to Standard Model predictions, the unitarity of the CKM matrix can be tested and b-quark Parton Density Functions studied. Possible searches include signatures of Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) (cf. Fig. 1d), W' boson, charged Higgs H + , a fourth generation of quarks and so on. Part of that program is already possible with the current ATLAS and CMS datasets of up to 2 fb \u22121 . More signatures will be studied in the future. a e-mail: Petra.Haefner@cern.ch  ",

            "text": "Due to its large cross section, the t-channel single top quark production has been addressed first by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Both have presented measurements based on the first year of LHC data, corresponding to 36 pb \u22121 (CMS) [4] and 35 pb \u22121 (ATLAS) [5]. The ATLAS collaboration has updated this analysis with 2011 data corresponding to 156 pb \u22121 [6] and a second time with 700 pb \u22121 [7]. Only the latter analysis will be described in the following. Both collaborations have used cut-based measurement techniques which are simple and robust as well as multivariate approaches which have in general higher sensitivities as they exploit the full kinematics of signal and backgrounds. However, those techniques have larger model dependencies. CMS uses a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) approach, whereas ATLAS applies a Neural Network (NN) technique. Both collaborations only consider events, where the W boson originating in the top quark decays leptonically into a lepton and neutrino. Therefore, an isolated lepton, either an electron or a muon, is required in the event selection.   They use anti-k T jets with a size parameter \u2206R of 0.5 for CMS and 0.4 for the ATLAS analysis. CMS selects only events with exactly 2 jets whereas ATLAS also allows 3jet events. Both analysis teams require one jet to be identified as a b-jet. CMS uses a technique based on the interaction point significance, whereas ATLAS explicitly identifies a secondary vertex, indicating a b-decay. Both collaborations also make requirements on the W boson from the top decay. CMS asks for a transverse mass of the lepton and the neutrino to be larger than 40 GeV in the muon case and larger than 50 GeV in the electron case. ATLAS requires that the transverse lepton-neutrino mass is larger than 60 GeV minus the missing transverse energy (E / t ). In addition, ATLAS makes an explicit cut on E / t to be larger than 25 GeV. More details about the event selection can be found in [4,7].",

The size is estimated from a simultaneous fit to the NN output or in the cut-based analysis taken from scale factors derived in three control regions. CMS distinguishes W+jets background containing heavy flavour jets (HF) or light jets only. For the first LO predictions are used scaled by fac-tors of the tt cross section analysis. The latter is scaled to NNLO precision in the BDT analysis. The cut-based analysis uses a normalization fitted to the transverse mass of the W boson M T (W) in two control regions. The shape is estimated by a data-driven model. For the QCD multi jet background ATLAS performs a likelihood fit to the E / t distribution to estimate the size and takes the shapes from a jet-electron model and a loose isolation muon sample.

These variables are chosen in order to minimize model dependencies. The background is treated as a free parameter in the fit. The data distributions of the two variables together with the results of the fit are shown in Fig. 2. As stated before, ATLAS uses both the 2-jets (1 b-tag) and 3-jets (1 b-tag) samples. Both samples are separated into four subsamples of lepton flavour and charge. These eight subsamples are simultaneously fitted. As in the CMS analysis, the background is a free parameter. The result of the fit together with the data points for the eight subsamples is given in Fig. 3 In the multivariate analyses, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) and a Neural Network (NN) are used by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations, respectively. Both analysis teams perform a fit to the full output distribution and again include the background as free parameter.

Again, only leptonic W decays to electrons or muons are taken into account. the transverse momentum of the lepton and jets are required to be larger than 25 GeV as well as the E / t . The same cut on the transverse mass of the W as in the t-channel analysis is performed (M T (W) > 60GeV \u2212 E / t ). The QCD multijet background is estimated from data from the E / t distribution in a loose isolation lepton sample. The W+jets background shape is taken from Monte Carlo simulation whereas the overall normalization and contributions of the different flavour subsamples is derived from data. Background from other top production channels, i.e. tt and tchannel single top, is estimated from theory predictions. In a final selection step, exactly two jets identified as -jets are required. This brings S/ \u221a B from 0.26 to 0.88. In addition, cuts on the mass of the reconstructed top quark and the first, respectively second, jet, the transverse momentum of the two jets combined, the transverse mass of the reconstructed W and the distance in \u2206R between the first jet and the lepton as well as the two jets are performed.

As in the previously described cross section analyses, only leptonic W boson decays are considered, with an electron or muon above 25 GeV in the final state. Cuts on the missing transverse energy and the transverse mass of the W require E / t > 35 GeV (20 GeV) and M T (W) > 25 GeV (60 GeV\u2212E / t ) in the electron (muon) channel. Events with exactly one jet, which has to be identified as a b-jet, with a transverse momentum above 25 GeV are selected. A Neural Network is used to separate the signal from tt, SM single top production, W/Z +jets and QCD multijet background. The result is shown in Fig. 8, left. No evidence for a signal has been found and an upper limit on a possible FCNC contribution has been derived (cf . Fig 8, right). On a 95% confidence level (C.L.), the cross section is smaller than 17.3 pb. This is in good agreement with the expected limit of 17.4 pb.",

The cross section was measured as 90 \u00b1 9 +31 \u221220 pb, with 64 \u00b1 3 pb being expected in the Standard Model. This is the first observation of single top production at the LHC.

Although this analysis has been performed on the largest dataset of 2.1 fb \u22121 in all single top analyses, the result is still compatible with the background-only hypothesis on the 2.7 \u03c3 level. ATLAS, on a smaller dataset of 0.7 fb \u22121 , found a deviation of only 1.2 \u03c3. However, it should be noted that a dataset of 5 fb \u22121 is already available in both collaborations, so that evidence in this channel can be expected in the near future. Both collaborations have shown that with the larger statistics available at the LHC simple cut-based analyses are possible in both channels and multivariate techniques, which were used at the Tevatron, are not a necessary prerequisite anymore.",
