            "text": "The hot and dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions, often referred to as the quarkgluon plasma (QGP), can be studied in various ways. The first way is to measure the yields of colorless particles in heavy-ion (AA) collisions that are unmodified in order to understand the initial state of the collisions. The second approach is to compare measurements made in AA collisions to those in proton-proton (pp) and proton-(or deuteron-) nucleus collisions. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) direct photons play the reference role [1]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, not only photons but also Z bosons, decaying to two leptons, become available [2,3]. Since, once produced, photons and leptons from Z decays traverse the produced hot and dense medium without interacting strongly, they provide a direct test of perturbative QCD (pQCD) and the nuclear parton densities [4]. High transverse energy (E T ) prompt photons in nucleus-nucleus collisions are produced directly from the hard scattering of two partons. In order to suppress the much larger background coming from the electromagnetic decays of neutral mesons (mostly \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3) produced in the fragmentation of the hard scattered partons, isolation requirements on the reconstructed photon candidates are imposed. The application of isolation requirements suppresses also the fragmentation photon component and enhances significantly photons coming from the quark-gluon Compton process [5].",

The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], with \u03b8 being the polar angle of the charged particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction. The nuclear overlap function T AA is the ratio of the number of binary nucleonnucleon collisions N coll calculated from a Glauber model of the nuclear collision geometry [10] and the inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross section \u03c3 NN inel = (64 \u00b1 5) mb at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [11]. In the absence of nuclear effects on the PbPb p T spectrum, the factor R AA is unity by construction. In particular, together with recent studies of jet quenching and fragmentation properties [12,13], the modification of the p T spectrum compared to nucleon-nucleon collisions at the same energy can shed light on the detailed mechanism by which hard partons lose energy traversing the medium [14].",

R AA is presented as a function of transverse momentum in Fig. 4 for each of the six centrality bins. In the most-peripheral events (70-90%), a moderate suppression of about two (R AA = 0.5) is observed at low p T with R AA rising gently with increasing transverse momentum. The suppression is increasingly pronounced in more-central collisions, as expected from the longer average path lengths traversed by hard-scattered partons as they lose energy via jet quenching. R AA reaches a minimum value of 0.13 around 6-7 GeV/c in the 0-5% bin. At higher p T , the value of R AA rises and levels off above 40 GeV/c at a value of approximately 0.5. A rising R AA may simply reflect the flattening of the unquenched nucleon-nucleon spectrum at high p T , although the magnitude of the rise is not strongly constrained by theory (see Fig. 5).  The evolution of the nuclear modification factor with center-of-mass energy from SPS [28,29] to RHIC [30,31] to the LHC [32] is presented in Fig. 5. Note that results are shown for both charged hadrons and neutral pions, the latter being somewhat more suppressed at low p T (e.g., parton recombination can produce an excess of protons [33]). At RHIC, the values of R AA from the two different measurements are seen to converge above roughly 8 GeV/c [30,31]. At low p T , the spectrum of charged particles is significantly more suppressed at the LHC than at RHIC, although the minimum values and the p T at which they occur are quite similar. It remains to be seen whether the similarity between the \u03c0 0 suppression observed by PHENIX at \u221a s NN =",
