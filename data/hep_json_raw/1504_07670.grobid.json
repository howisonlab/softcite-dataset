The efficiency for identifying a b(c) jet is about 65%(25%) with a probability for misidentifying a light-parton jet of 0.3% for jets with transverse momentum pT>20 GeV and pseudorapidity 2.2<<4.2.

For example, the ability to efficiently identify b jets with minimal misidentification of c and light-parton jets is crucial for the measurement of top-quark production. The study of tt production in the forward region probes the structure of the proton [1] and can be used to search for physics beyond the SM [2]. Measuring charge asymmetries in di-b-jet production also probes beyond the SM physics [3,4]. Furthermore, identification of c jets is important for probing the structure of the proton, e.g. in W +c production.",

This paper describes two algorithms for identifying b and c jets, one designed to identify both b and c jets offline, and another initially designed to identify b-hadron decays in the trigger. The performance of each algorithm is measured using several subsamples of the 3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a s = 7 TeV in 2011 and at 8 TeV in 2012 by the LHCb detector.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [7], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [8] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV (c = 1 throughout this paper). The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters have an energy resolution of \u03c3(E)/E = 10%/ \u221a E \u2295 1% and \u03c3(E)/E = 69%/ \u221a E \u2295 9% (with E in GeV), respectively.

This inclusive trigger algorithm is called the topological trigger (TOPO) and is studied as a b-jet tagger in this paper.

Information from all the detector sub-systems is used to create charged and neutral particle inputs to the jet algorithm using a particle flow approach [21]. During 2011 and 2012, LHCb collected data with a mean number of pp collisions per crossing of about 1.7. To reduce contamination from multiple pp interactions, charged particles reconstructed within the vertex detector may only be clustered into a jet if they are associated to the same PV. The identification of (b, c) jets is performed using SVs from the decays of (b, c) hadrons. The choice of using SVs and not single-track or other non-SV-based jet properties, e.g. the number of particles in the jet, is driven by the need for a small misidentification probability of light-parton jets in the analyses performed at LHCb. Furthermore, the properties of SVs from (b, c)-hadron decays are known to be well modeled in LHCb simulation.",

The distributions in the two-dimensional BDT plane of SV-tagged b, c, and light-parton jets are clearly distinguishable. The full two-dimensional distribution is fitted in data to determine the jet flavor content. However, to aid in comparison to other jet-tagging algorithms, a requirement of BDT(bc|udsg) > 0.2 is applied to display the performance obtained from simulated events in Fig. 2.

A simple cross-check on the b, c and light-parton yields is performed by fitting only two of the BDT inputs: the corrected mass defined in Eq. 1 and the number of tracks in the SV. The corrected mass provides the best discrimination between c jets and other jet types due to the fact that M cor peaks near the D meson mass for c jets 3 . The number of tracks in the SV identifies b jets well since b-hadron decays often produce many displaced tracks. Figure 7 shows the results of a two-dimensional fit to these two SV properties. The absolute fractions of b, c and light-parton SV tags agree with the BDT fit results to within 1-2%. The corrected mass has been previously used in LHCb jet analyses for determining the c-jet yield [23] and for extracting the b-jet yield [25]. The clear peaking structure for c jets, which relies on the excellent vertex resolution of the LHCb detector, makes them easily identifiable. Figure 8 shows the results of fitting the TOPO BDT distributions in the various data samples using b, c and light-parton jet template shapes obtained from simulation. The ratios of SV-tagger to TOPO SV-tagged b, c and light-parton jets are each consistent with expectations from simulation. Modeling of both the SV-tagger and TOPO SV properties are sufficient to allow the SV-tagged content to be accurately determined.    ",

The tagging efficiencies obtained in simulation for b and c jets are used to estimate the total number of b and c jets in the W+jet data sample. Since the b and c jets combined make up only 5% of the total data sample, any mismodeling of the SV-tagging efficiency will have negligible impact on this study. The IP resolution is studied by comparing the observed \u03c7 2 IP distributions in data with templates obtained from simulation in bins of jet p T . The resolution in data is found to be about 10% worse than in the simulation which is consistent with previous LHCb studies of the IP resolution [7]. Figure 9 shows that the data-driven templates describe the data well. The difference in the detector response between data and simulation is assumed to be universal and is applied to correct the \u03c7 2 IP templates for b and c jets. Figure 10 shows the results of fitting the \u03c7 2 IP distributions in the B+jet, D+jet and \u00b5(b, c)+jet data samples.

This uncertainty is sizable for the case of high-p T c jets whose \u03c7 2 IP template is less distinct from that of light-parton jets which has a variable large-IP component in the fit. Possible dependence of the mismodeling of the IP resolution on the origin point of the particle is studied and found to be negligible. For the case of muon jets, the misidentification probability of hadrons as muons and the jet track multiplicity must be modeled properly to obtain an accurate \u03c7 2 IP distribution. Mismodeling of these properties does not lead to large uncertainty on N b (\u03c7 2 IP ), since the vast majority of reconstructed muons in b jets are truly muons that arise due to semileptonic decays. For c jets, however, mismodeling of these properties can produce sizable shifts in N c (\u03c7 2 IP ) due to the smaller fraction of c jets that contain muons from semileptonic decays. A comparison between W+jet data and simulation of the jet fraction that satisfies the muon-jet requirements, in bins of jet p T , is used to obtain an estimate of the probability of misidentifying a jet as a muon jet. Based on this study a 5% relative uncertainty is assigned to N b (\u03c7 2 IP ) and 20% to N c (\u03c7 2 IP ) for muon jets. Another possible way of misidentifying muon jets is if the semileptonic decay of a b hadron outside of the jet produces a muon reconstructed as part of the jet 4 .

In the data samples considered in this study, such effects are negligible as using BDT templates from different event types results in differences in the SV-tagged yields of less than 1%. Events where multiple b hadrons are produced could affect the SV BDT shapes. The fraction of SVs that contain a track with \u2206R > 0.5 relative to the jet axis is studied in data with the back-to-back requirement for the event-tag and test jet removed. The fraction of SVs that contain such a track is found to vary by at most a few percent as a function of \u2206R between the event-tag and test jet.

Therefore, both backward and too-long-lived SVs are also found in (b, c) jets. The W+jet data sample, which is dominantly composed of light-parton jets, is used to mitigate effects from mistagged (b, c) jets. Figure 16 shows the BDT distributions from backward and too-long-lived SVs observed in data compared to simulation. The backward and too-long-lived BDT templates are similar for all jet types. The (b, c) yields here are fixed by fitting the nominal SV-tagged data to obtain the total (b, c)-jet content then taking the backward and too-long-lived SV-tag probabilities for (b, c) jets from simulation. The distributions in data and simulation are consistent, which demonstrates that the SV properties are well-modeled for light-parton jets. The total light-parton-jet composition of this sample, without applying any SV-tagging algorithm, is found to be 95%, by fitting the nominal SV-tagged BDT distributions and applying the data-driven (b, c)-tagging efficiencies from the previous section. The mistag probability of light-parton jets is obtained as the ratio of the number of SV-tags for those jets (obtained by fitting the SV BDT distributions) to the total number of light-parton jets. The ratio of this probability in data to that in simulation is shown in Fig. 17; data and simulation agree at about the \u00b130% level integrated over jet p T . A detailed study of W+jet production in LHCb using the SV-tagger algorithm introduced in this paper, in which the jets are required to satisfy p T > 20 GeV and 2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.2, finds that the nominal light-parton-jet mistag probability is 0.3% which is consistent with simulation [26].

The absolute difference in the fraction of light-parton jets that are SV-tagged and have BDT(bc|udsg) > 0.2 is found to be at the per mille level for low-p T jets, but increases to about 1% for jet p T of 50 GeV and to about 2-3% at 100 GeV. The BDT shapes are distorted relative to those obtained in events that contain no (b, c) jets, but there is still significant discrimination between the light-parton and (b, c) distributions. The difference is largely due to particles originating from a b-hadron decay and produced with \u2206R < 0.5 relative to the light-parton-jet axis.
