Next-generation detectors to be built in the next decade will have enhanced flavor sensitivity and statistics. Not only will the observation of this burst allow us to peer inside the dense matter of the extreme event and learn about the collapse processes and the birth of the remnant, but the neutrinos will bring information about neutrino properties themselves. This review surveys some of the physical signatures that the currently-unknown neutrino mass pattern will imprint on the observed neutrino events at Earth, emphasizing the most robust and least model-dependent signatures of mass ordering.",

The 1987A neutrino signal in water and scintillator detectors led to the best limits, at that time, on absolute mass scale of the neutrino, based on the lack of energy-dependent spread (e.g., [4]). These limits were soon exceeded by terrestrial measurements, but other limits on neutrino properties (and other particle physics) still stand as the most stringent [4,5]. Statistics for the 1987A observation were paltry though-just a few dozen events were recorded, nearly all likely to be electron antineutrinos [6].",

There are still unknowns, however, and a supernova neutrino burst may tell us about some of these unknowns. While laboratory measurements will likely address many of these unknowns in due course, a timely supernova burst may be the first to give us some of the answers. Even if terrestrial measurements come first, they will help to constrain the observables to improve astrophysical interpretation of the data. Better astrophysical observations of the supernova (in electromagnetic wavelengths and potentially in gravitational waves) will, in turn, improve modeling and hence will sharpen extraction of neutrino properties, in a virtuous circle. There may be surprises, too-current data allow for neutrino properties outside of the standard three-flavor picture, and beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomenology could also affect the supernova neutrino burst observables.",

The parameters of nature in this picture are: the three mixing angles \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 12 and \u03b8 13 plus a complex phase \u03b4 associated with CP-violating observables, as well as the three masses m 1 , m 2 and m 3 . The mass state information is available from oscillation experiments as masssquared differences, \u2206m 2 ij \u2261 m 2 i \u2212 m 2 j ; three masses can equivalently be reported as two mass-squared differences and an absolute mass scale. Table 1 summarizes our knowledge of the mixing parameters from the global fit described in [8]. While improved precision on all neutrino mixing parameters will be welcome, and we expect oscillation experiments to make progress in the next few decades, there are still two quantities in this picture that are largely unknown, although there does exist at the current time some statistically-weak information about them from combined beam and reactor data. The first unknown is the so-called 'mass ordering' (MO) or 'mass hierarchy', equivalent to the signs of the mass differences \u2021. For 'normal mass ordering' (NMO) \u00a7, we have m 3 >> m 2 , m 1 , or two light and one heavy state. For 'inverted ordering' (IMO), we have m 2 , m 1 >> m 3 . We denote \u2206m 2 3 as the larger mass-squared difference, with =1 for NMO and = 2 for IMO. The overall absolute mass scale is also unknown (although it is known to be less than a few eV/c 2 ), but this parameter cannot be addressed by oscillation experiments.",

Thermonuclear supernovae, observationally tagged as Type Ia, are thought to be due to a thermonuclear explosion ignited after mass is accreted onto one of the stars in a binary system, although the exact mechanism is not well understood. These events are not likely to produce very many neutrinos, although they are expected to produce some-see section 6.2.6. The other main supernova type, the core-collapse supernova, corresponding observationally to Types II, Ib, Ic and some others, results from the collapse of a massive star which can no longer support its mass via nuclear burning. These astrophysical events are well known to be generous in their neutrino production-for a brief time, the neutrino production outshines the photon luminosity by orders of magnitude. The physics of core collapse is the subject of supercomputer simulation studies by several groups worldwide (see References [21,22,23,24,25] for reviews), and understanding has become more and more sophisticated over the past few decades. Although full understanding of all details of the physical mechanisms of the collapse and subsequent explosion has not yet been achieved, the general mechanism of neutrino production is understood, and well confirmed with the observation of SN1987A. In broad brush, the gravitational binding energy of the highly-compact remnant leaks away from the star in the form of neutrinos, thanks to the weakness of neutrino interactions in matter. The timescale of energy loss, a few tens of seconds, is that of the trapping of the neutrinos and is set by the scale of the weak interaction with matter.",

            "text": "Up to now, the most important interaction experimentally has been inverse beta decay (IBD) on protons,\u03bd e + p \u2192 n + e + . This interaction dominates for detectors with many free protons-which includes all of the currently-running large neutrino detectors (see Sec. 5.2). IBD not only has a relatively high cross section, but the main observable interaction product, the positron, gains an energy which tracks the neutrino energy relatively well, so measurement of its energy loss enables a\u03bd e spectral measurement. In some detectors, the neutron is captured (on free protons, or a dopant like Gd), and provides a reasonable tag of IBD, and hence of\u03bd e . Another interaction of relevance, which occurs for all detectors, is elastic scattering (ES) on electrons, \u03bd +e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bd +e \u2212 , which proceeds via both NC and CC channels (for a supernova flux, ES interactions will be dominated by \u03bd e scatters). This interaction is directional, and the directionality can be used to improve flavor tagging (and for pointing to the supernova) in some detectors. All detectors also have some level of interaction of neutrinos and antineutrinos with nuclei, via CC channels (\u03bd e + (N, Z) \u2192 (N + 1, Z \u2212 1) * + e + ) or via NC channels (\u03bd x + (N, Z) \u2192 \u03bd x + (N, Z) * ). For the CC interactions, the lepton (electron or positron) is observable, and in both cases there may be observable nuclear deexcitation products, which can in principle also provide interaction channel tagging. Typically the antineutrino interaction is suppressed in nuclei due to Pauli blocking. A notable nuclear interaction case is \u03bd e on argon, \u03bd e + 40 Ar \u2192 e \u2212 + 40 K * ; this reaction gives liquid argon detectors, uniquely among large supernova-neutrino-sensitive detectors, excellent sensitivity to the electron flavor component of the flux. NC elastic scattering on protons in scintillator and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) in nuclei in dark matter detectors will also record all flavors [54], although detection with very large amounts of target mass is challenging.",

However, the current best limits from tritium beta decay endpoint experiments are now \u223c2 eV/c 2 [10] (and cosmology constraints are even more stringent, although model-dependent). For few-tens-of-MeV massive neutrinos, the delays will then be less than tens of milliseconds for a travel distance of 10 kpc. If the neutrinos were all emitted simultaneously, an observed neutrino event time spread could give us improved information about the absolute mass scale. However, the emission time scale of the burst -10 seconds or so-exceeds the typical delay by a large factor, so one must look for signatures of mass scale in the subtle energy-dependent timing of the arrival pattern. The lower the energies observed, the longer the delays, so better the sensitivity. Sensitivity has only weak dependence on distance; as the distance increases, delay increases linearly with D, but observed counts decrease as the inverse square of D. Large statistics, good energy resolution and low thresholds are needed. A sharp time structure (e.g., neutrino flux cutoff due to collapse to a black hole [55]), or possibly observation of a gravitational wave signal of core collapse [56,57] to serve as a reference time, could potentially improve sensitivity. References [58,59] estimate sensitivities of current and next-generation experiments down to some fraction of an eV. This is better than the current limits, but not competitive with expected next-generation experiments such as KATRIN [60].",

            "text": "A potential dramatic MO-dependent effect on the time dependent supernova neutrino spectra is the so-called 'spectral split' due to collective effects [68,69,70,71]. The effect is that the neutrino flavor spectra are swapped above or below a particular energy threshold, depending on both the initial relative flavor luminosities and in neutrinos or antineutrinos depending on the hierarchy. Observationally this results in non-thermal observed spectral shapes in either neutrinos or antineutrinos [72]: see figure 8 for the example observed spectra corresponding to the fluxes of figure 5. These non-thermal spectral distortions can also track the propagation of the shock wave. There is enough variety of phenomenology in the literature describing this kind of signature that this signature can not yet be considered robust. However, there are potentially multiple signatures at different times in the star's evolution. 6.2.5. Earth matter effect Finally, the neutrinos arrive at Earth as mass states and may travel through matter before arriving at a detector. They will undergo conventional matter effects in the Earth which will modulate the spectrum according to the distance and densities traversed in matter, with flavor-dependent effect depending on the MO, as described in section 4.1.3. Wiggles in the spectrum of around \u223cfew-10 MeV frequency and amplitude of a few percent will appear in antineutrinos in the NMO case, and in neutrinos in the IMO case. Figure 9 shows an example of the effect for\u03bd e observed by IBD. Fourier analysis of a well-measured energy spectrum could potentially identify the ordering based on presence or absence of a peak in the appropriate channels [74,40].",

            "text": "6.2.6. Non-core-collapse supernovae As a final note, we mention the Type Ia (thermonuclear) supernova case. As noted above, these have a quite different physical mechanism from the core-collapse scenario, and are expected to be much fainter in neutrinos. The mechanism is not fully understood, and is thought to take place either according to a 'deflagration-to-detonation transition' (DDT) or a 'gravitationally confined detonation' (GCD) scenario. Still, there should be some neutrino production [80,81,82] albeit some orders of magnitude less than for a core-collapse event; the DDT scenario is expected to produce a fainter neutrino flux. For the more neutrino-generous DDT model, Hyper-K would detect a handful of events at 10 kpc, and Super-K and DUNE would see a few events at 1 kpc; the distance sensitivity is reduced to \u223c1 kpc and \u223c0.3 kpc respectively for the GCD model. From the point of view of distinguishing the mass ordering, an observation of a thermonuclear supernova has the advantage that the flavor transition effects are purely MSW-there are no self-interaction effects to confound the interpretation. And for a nearby Type Ia supernova, we may be able to observe the event closely enough in electromagnetic channels to understand the mechanism. According to [82], if the mechanism is understood, with future generation detectors we should be able to distinguish the MO at 1\u03c3 for a Type Ia at \u223c3 kpc for DDT and \u223c0.5 kpc for GCD: see figure 10. Figure 10. From reference [82] (used with permission): Expected events in Hyper-K vs. distance to the Type Ia SN. The green shaded regions are for the NMO assumptions, with darkest to lightest corresponding to 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 Poisson event count ranges. The orange regions show the same for the IMO assumption. The left plot corresponds to the DDT model and the right plot corresponds to the GCD model (see text). The black dots with dotted vertical lines show the distances at which NMO and IMO can be distinguished for a given \u03c3 level, assuming the explosion model is known.",

Pair-instability supernovae are a class of less common, superluminous supernovae from very massive carbon-oxygen-core progenitors, in which a thermonuclear explosion follows collapse due to conversion of photons to electron-positron pairs. In principle the emitted neutrinos could also exhibit observable MO-dependent effects. However, as for Type Ia supernovae, the neutrino signal is relatively faint and observation would require a nearby explosion.",
