The unique properties of the Borexino detector provided an oppurtunity to disentangle pp-neutrino spectrum from the background components. A comparison of the total neutrino flux from the Sun with Solar luminosity in photons provides a test of the stability of the Sun on the 10 5 years time scale, and sets a strong limit on the power production in the unknown energy sources in the Sun of no more than 4% of the total energy production at 90% C.L.",

Some additional smearing of the signal is expected because of the continuously decreasing number of the PMTs in operation.

A common approximation with a normal distribution is failing to describe the tails of the MC-generated monoenergetic response already at the statistics of the order of 10 3 events. This was notified already in the first phase of Borexino and the approximation of the scintillation line shape with generalized gamma-function [29] have been used to fit monoenergetic 210 Po peak in the solar 7 Be neutrino analysis [30,31,7]. The generalized gamma-function (GGC) was developed for the energy estimator based on the total collected charge, but it provided a reasonable approximation for the energy estimator based on the number of triggered PMTs given the moderate statistics corresponding to the total amount of the events in 210 Po peak. The fit quality of the 210 Po peak is rather insensitive to the residual deviations in the tails. This is not the case for the precise 14 C spectrum modeling, as all the events in the fraction of the 14 C spectrum above the energy threshold originate from the spectral smearing. An ideal detector's response to the point-like monoenergetic source at the center is a perfect binomial distribution and it would be well approximated by a Poisson distribution. When dealing with real response one should adjust the \"base distribution\" width to take into account at least the additional smearing of the signal due to the various factors. The problem with binomial \"base function\" (or with its Poisson approximation) is that its width is defined by the mean value. In case of Poisson the variance of the signal coincide with mean \u00b5. A better approximation of the response function was tested with MC model, namely the scaled Poisson (SP) distribution:",
