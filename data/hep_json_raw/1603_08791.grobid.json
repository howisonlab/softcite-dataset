If produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these new beyond-the-SM (BSM) particles could decay into quarks (q) or gluons (g), creating resonant excesses in the two-jet (dijet) invariant mass distributions [1][2][3][4][5][6]. If the new particle couples to the b-quark and decays into bb, bq or bg pairs, a dedicated search for dijet resonances with one or both jets identified as originating from a b-quark (\"b-jet\") could greatly increase the signal sensitivity.",

Excited heavy-flavour quarks have been investigated in alternative decay modes as well [10]. No BSM phenomena have been observed yet. The increase in centre-of-mass energy of the pp collisions at the LHC from \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV to 13 TeV provides a new energy regime in which to search for such a heavy resonance. This is particularly true for heavy states coupling to b-quarks from the proton sea, when compared to states produced by valence quarks. The parton luminosity to create a 2 TeV object increases by an additional factor of 2-3 for bb and bg over qq and qg pairs, when increasing the centre-of-mass energy from 8 TeV to 13 TeV.

The results are interpreted in the context of two benchmark processes shown in Fig. 1: an excited heavy-flavour quark b * and a new gauge boson Z . Excited quarks are a consequence of quark compositeness models that were proposed to explain the generational structure and mass hierarchy of quarks [11,12]. The Z boson arises in many extensions to the SM with an additional U (1) group. Two Z models are considered, one with SM-like fermion couplings in the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) and a leptophobic Z model [13,14]. All benchmark model decays are expected to result in a narrow resonance superimposed on a smoothly falling dijet invariant mass distribution. This search divides the events into samples with one or two jets identified as b-jets to enhance the signal sensitivity to the benchmark models b * \u2192 bg and Z \u2192 bb. In addition, the results are interpreted in the context of possible Gaussian-shaped signal contributions to the dijet invariant mass spectra where one or both jets are identified as b-jets. The results, presented in terms of the cross section times acceptance times branching ratio (\u03c3 \u00d7 A \u00d7 BR), are quoted for contributions with widths of up to 15% of the resonance mass.",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of, in ascending order of radius from the beam-line, silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. The pixel detectors are crucial for b-jet identification. For the second LHC data-taking period, a new inner pixel layer, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [16,17], was added at a mean sensor radius of 3.2 cm from the beam-line. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9.

The uncertainty in the measured tagging efficiency of b-jets is estimated by studying tt events in 13 TeV data for jet p T up to 200 GeV [31]. The uncertainties in the measured rate of mistagging c-jets and light-flavour jets are estimated in 8 TeV data. The uncertainties are extrapolated to 13 TeV, taking into account the addition of the new IBL system as well as reconstruction and tagging improvements. An additional term is included to extrapolate the measured uncertainties to the high-p T region of interest. This term is calculated from simulated events by considering variations on the quantities affecting the b-tagging performance such as the impact parameter resolution, percentage of poorly measured tracks, description of the detector material, and track multiplicity per jet. The dominant effect on the uncertainty when extrapolating at high-p T is related to the different tagging efficiency when smearing the tracks impact parameters based on the resolution measured in data and simulation. The difference in the impact parameter resolution is due to effects from alignment, dead modules and additional material not properly modelled in the simulation. The impact of the b-tagging efficiency uncertainty increases with jet p T and reaches 50% above 2 TeV.  ",
