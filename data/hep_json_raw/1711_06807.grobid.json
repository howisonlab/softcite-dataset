It will operate at a center-of-mass energy of 240-250 GeV and is expected to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 5 ab \u22121 with ten years of operation. At CEPC, Higgs bosons are dominantly produced from ZH associated process. Vast amount of Higgs events collected will enable precise studies of its properties including Yukawa couplings to massive particles. With GEANT4-based simulation of detector effects, we study CEPC feasibility on measuring Higgs boson decaying into a pair of muons. The results with or without information from Z boson decay products are provided, which show a signal significance of over 10 standard deviations can be achieved and the H-\u00b5-\u00b5 coupling can be measured within 10% accuracy.",

            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs-like boson completes the particle table of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Up-to-date LHC measurements all indicate that the Higgs boson is indeed highly SM like [1][2][3][4][5][6]. In the SM, Higgs couplings to massive particles are proportional to their mass (square). Hence the event rate with Higgs couplings to the first and second generation of massive fermions can be very small, making them difficult to measure at the LHC. The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) [7], however, is designed to run around 240 \u223c 250 GeV with an instantaneous luminosity of 2 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , and will deliver 5 ab \u22121 of integrated luminosity with ten years of running. The huge amount of data will enable precise measurement of the Higgs to light fermions branching ratios and determine associated Yukawa couplings, including H-\u00b5-\u00b5, which is crucial to validate consistency of the SM Higgs mechanism since any deviation indicates the existence of new physics.",

With an integrated luminosity of 5000 fb \u22121 , about 230 of our signal events H \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 can be produced. The expected background to the signal production includes 2fermion processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 ff , where f can be any SM fermion other than the top quark, and 4-fermion processes, which can be mediated through associated ZZ, WW, ZZ, WW production and a single Z boson production. All Monte Carlo (MC) events are generated with Whizard V1.9.5 [16] event generator at parton level with ISR and interference effects included. The generated events are interfaced to Pythia 6 [17] for parton shower and hadronization simulation. Detector effects are simulated with the CEPC detector implemented with Mokka/GEANT4 [7,18,19]. The detector is assumed to have a similar structure as the International Large Detector (ILD) [20,21] at the ILC [22].
