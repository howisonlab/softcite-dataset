We analysed e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 ISR events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 239 pb \u22121 to find evidence for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 U \u03b3, U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 process. We found no U vector boson signal and set a 90% CL upper limit on the ratio of the U boson and photon coupling constants between 1.6\u00d710 \u22125 to 8.6\u00d710 \u22127 in the mass region 520 < M U < 980 MeV. A projection of the KLOE sensitivity for the \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 and \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 channels at full statistics and extended muon acceptance is also presented.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) [1][2][3][4][5] assume that dark matter (DM) is made up of new particles charged under some new interaction mediated by a new gauge vector boson called U (also referred to as dark photon or A'). The U boson can kinetically mix with the ordinary photon through high-order diagrams, providing therefore a small coupling with SM particles [1][2][3][4][5]. The coupling strength can be expressed by a single factor, \u03b5, equal to the ratio of dark and Standard Model electromagnetic couplings [1]. A U boson with mass of O(1GeV) and \u03b5 in the range 10 \u22122 -10 \u22127 could explain all puzzling effects observed in recent astrophysics experiments [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. By using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 239 pb \u22121 , KLOE investigated the the radiative U \u03b3 production with U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . New searches are foreseen to exploit the full KLOE statistics for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 channel and also to search for the U \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay.",

            "text": "The \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 event selection requires two tracks of opposite charge with 50 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 130 \u2022 and an undetected photon whose momentum, computed according to the \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 kinematics, points at small polar angle (\u03b8 < 15 \u2022 , > 165 \u2022 ) [15,16]. These requirements limit the range of M \u00b5\u00b5 to be larger than 500 MeV and greatly reduce the contamination from the resonant and Final State Radiation (FSR) processes: e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 FSR and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 FSR . The above selection criteria are also satisfied by e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 radiative Bhabha events. To obtain additional separation between electrons and pions or muons, a particle identification estimator (L i ), based on a pseudo-likelihood function using time-of-flight and calorimeter information is used [15,16]. Events with both tracks satisfying L i < 0 are rejected as e + e \u2212 \u03b3 with a \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3/\u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 loss less than 0.05%. Pions and muons are identified by means of the variable M trk defined as the mass of oppositely-charged particles in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 x + x \u2212 \u03b3 process in which we assume the presence of an unobserved photon and that the tracks belong to particles of the same mass with momentum equal to the observed value. The M trk values between 80-115 identify muons while M trk values >130 MeV identify pions. A cut on the quality of the fitted tracks, parametrized by the error on M trk , \u03c3 M trk , has been implemented to further improve the \u03c0/\u00b5 separation [15]. At the end of the analysis chain, residual backgrounds consisting of e + e \u2212 \u2192e + e \u2212 \u03b3, e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c6\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are still present. The last two contributions have been evaluated from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation while the e + e \u2212 \u2192e + e \u2212 \u03b3 events have been estimated directly from data [15,16]. Additional background from e + e \u2212 \u2192e + e \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is at the percent level below 0.54 GeV and decreases with M \u00b5\u00b5 . Fig. 1 left shows the fractions of the background processes, F BG , as a function of M \u00b5\u00b5 while Fig. 1 right shows the measured \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 cross section compared with the NLO QED calculations, using the MC code PHOKHARA [17]. The agreement between measurement and the PHOKHARA simulation is excellent, proving analysis consistency. No structures are visible in the M \u00b5\u00b5 spectrum.",

The resulting exclusion plot on the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5 2 , in the 520-980 MeV mass range, is shown in Fig. 2. In the same plot, other limits in the mass range below 1 GeV are also shown [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. Our 90% CL limit is between 1.6\u00d710 \u22125 and 8.6\u00d710 \u22127 in the 520-980 MeV mass range [15]. An upgrade of the presented analysis is foreseen by employing the full KLOE data statistics corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb \u22121 and by extending the muon polar angle acceptance from 50 \u2022 to 35 \u2022 and from 130 \u2022 to 145 \u2022 . The KLOE reach in sensitivity by considering a 2 MeV invariant mass resolution is presented in Fig. 2 (red line) at N U / N QED = 2. The sensitivity loss due to the \u03c1 meson around 770 MeV is due to the branching fraction of the U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channel which is suppressed by the dominant hadronic decay mode U \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . To overcome this problem KLOE-2 plans to carry on also a new analysis by exploiting the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 channel. The detailed KLOE-2 physics program is presented in Ref. [27]. The KLOE reach at full statistics for the \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 channel is shown in Fig. 2 at N U / N QED = 2 and a 2 MeV binning factor (green).",
