The same analysis is also used to search for four-top-quark production in several new physics scenarios. The search is based on a dataset of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . Data are analysed in the lepton+jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon with high transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum and multiple jets, as well as the jets+E miss T final state, characterised by multiple jets and large missing transverse momentum. The search exploits the high multiplicity of jets identified as originating from b-quarks, and the presence of boosted, hadronically decaying top quarks and Higgs bosons reconstructed as large-radius jets, characteristic of signal events. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the production cross sections for the different signal processes considered. These cross-section limits are used to derive lower limits on the mass of a vector-like T quark under several branching ratio hypotheses assuming contributions from T \u2192 W b, Zt, Ht decays. The 95% CL observed lower limits on the T quark mass range between 0.99 TeV and 1.43 TeV for all possible values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes considered, significantly extending the reach beyond that of previous searches. Additionally, upper limits on anomalous four-topquark production are set in the context of an effective field theory model, as well as in an universal extra dimensions model.",

A comprehensive programme of measurements of the Higgs boson properties to unravel its nature is underway at the LHC, so far yielding results compatible with the SM predictions. This makes it more urgent than ever before to provide an explanation for why the electroweak mass scale (and the Higgs boson mass along with it) is so small compared to the Planck scale, a situation known as the hierarchy problem.

            "text": "One such solution involves the existence of a new strongly interacting sector, in which the Higgs boson would be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson [4] of a spontaneously broken global symmetry. One particular realisation of this scenario, referred to as Composite Higgs [5,6], addresses many open questions in the SM, such as the stability of the Higgs boson mass against quantum corrections, and the hierarchy in the mass spectrum of the SM particles, which would be explained by partial compositeness. In this scenario, the top quark would be a mostly composite particle, while all other SM fermions would be mostly elementary. A key prediction is the existence of new fermionic resonances referred to as vector-like quarks, which are also common in many other BSM scenarios. Vector-like quarks are defined as colour-triplet spin-1/2 fermions whose left-and right-handed chiral components have the same transformation properties under the weak-isospin SU(2) gauge group [7,8]. Depending on the model, vector-like quarks are classified as SU(2) singlets, doublets or triplets of flavours T , B, X or Y , in which the first two have the same charge as the SM top and bottom quarks while the vector-like Y and X quarks have charge \u22124/3e and 5/3e. In addition, in these models, vector-like quarks are expected to couple preferentially to third-generation quarks [7,9] and can have flavour-changing neutral-current decays in addition to the charged-current decays characteristic of chiral quarks. As a result, an uptype T quark can decay not only into a W boson and a b-quark, but also into a Z or Higgs boson and a top quark (T \u2192 W b, Zt, and Ht). Similarly, a down-type B quark can decay into a Z or Higgs boson and a b quark, in addition to decaying into a W boson and a top quark (B \u2192 W t, Zb and Hb). Vector-like Y quarks decay exclusively into W b and vectorlike X quarks decay exclusively into W t. To be consistent with the results from precision electroweak measurements a small mass-splitting between vector-like quarks belonging to the same SU(2) multiplet is required, but no requirement is placed on which member of the multiplet is heavier [10]. At the LHC, vector-like quarks with masses below \u223c1 TeV would be predominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction. For higher masses, single production, mediated by the electroweak interaction, may dominate depending on the coupling strength of the interaction between the vector-like quark and the SM quarks.",

In particular, the class of models where such vector particles are strongly coupled to the right-handed top quark are much less constrained by precision electroweak measurements than in the case of couplings to the left-handed top quark [16].

Anomalous four-top-quark production also arises in Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) models, which involve new heavy particles. For instance, in an UED model with two extra dimensions that are compactified using the geometry of the real projective plane (2UED/RPP) [18], the momenta of particles are discretised along the directions of the extra dimensions. A tier of Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers is labelled by two integers, k and , referred to as \"tier (k, )\". Within a given tier, the squared masses of the particles are given at leading order by m 2 = k 2 /R 2 4 + 2 /R 2 5 , where \u03c0R 4 and \u03c0R 5 are the sizes of the two extra dimensions. The model is parameterised by R 4 and R 5 or, alternatively, by m KK = 1/R 4 and \u03be = R 4 /R 5 . Four-top-quark production can arise from tier (1,1), where particles from this tier have to be pair produced because of symmetries of the model. Then they chain-decay into the lightest particle of this tier, the heavy photon A (1,1) , by emitting SM particles. The branching ratios of A (1,1) into SM particles are not predicted by the model, although the decay into tt is expected to be dominant [19].",

The inner detector consists of a high-granularity silicon pixel detector, including the insertable B-layer [28], installed in 2014, and a silicon microstrip tracker, together providing a precise reconstruction of tracks of charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, complemented by a transition radiation tracker providing tracking and electron identification information for |\u03b7| < 2.0. The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. The muon spectrometer measures the trajectories of muons with |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers located in a toroidal field of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T in the central and endcap regions of ATLAS, respectively.

The reconstructed jets are then calibrated to the particle level by the application of a jet energy scale derived from simulation and in situ corrections based on \u221a s = 13 TeV data [38]. Calibrated jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Quality criteria are imposed to reject events that contain any jets arising from non-collision sources or detector noise [39]. To reduce the contamination due to jets originating from pile-up interactions, an additional requirement on the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) [40] output is made for jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

Overlaps between electron and jet candidates are resolved next, and finally, overlaps between remaining jet candidates and muon candidates are removed. Clusters from identified electrons are not excluded during jet reconstruction. In order to avoid double-counting of electrons as jets, the closest jet whose axis is within \u2206R = 0.2 of an electron is discarded. If the electron is within \u2206R = 0.4 of the axis of any jet after this initial removal, the jet is retained and the electron is removed. The overlap removal procedure between the remaining jet candidates and muon candidates is designed to remove those muons that are likely to have arisen in the decay chain of hadrons and to retain the overlapping jet instead. Jets and muons may also appear in close proximity when the jet results from high-p T muon bremsstrahlung, and in such cases the jet should be removed and the muon retained. Such jets are characterised by having very few matching inner-detector tracks. Selected muons that satisfy \u2206R(\u00b5, jet) < 0.04 + 10 GeV/p \u00b5 T are rejected if the jet has at least three tracks originating from the primary vertex; otherwise the jet is removed and the muon is kept.",

In this way it is possible to evaluate the uncertainty in the mass of the large-R jets that arises from the uncertainties in the energy scale and resolution of its constituent small-R jets. In order to suppress contributions from pile-up and soft radiation, the reclustered large-R (RCLR) jets are trimmed [44] by removing all small-R (sub)jets within a RCLR jet that have p T below 5% of the p T of the reclustered jet. Due to the pile-up suppression and p T > 25 GeV requirements made on the small-R jets, the average fraction of small-R jets removed by the trimming requirement is less than 1%. The resulting RCLR jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.0 and are used to identify high-p T hadronically decaying top quark or Higgs boson candidates by making requirements on their transverse momentum, mass, and number of constituents. Hadronically decaying top quark candidates are reconstructed as RCLR jets with p T > 300 GeV, mass larger than 140 GeV, and at least two subjets. Higgs boson candidates are reconstructed as RCLR jets with p T > 200 GeV, a mass between 105 and 140 GeV, and a p T -dependent requirement on the number of subjets (exactly two for p T < 500 GeV, and one or two for p T > 500 GeV).

The A14 [55] set of optimised parameters for the underlying event (UE) description using the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set, referred to as the \"A14 UE tune\", was used. The samples were generated JHEP07(2018)089 assuming singlet couplings and for heavy-quark masses between 350 GeV and 1.5 TeV in steps of 50 GeV. Additional samples were produced at three mass points (700 GeV, 950 GeV and 1.2 TeV) assuming doublet couplings in order to confirm that, at fixed branching fraction, kinematic differences arising from the different chirality of singlet and doublet couplings have negligible impact on this search. The vector-like quarks were forced to decay with a branching ratio of 1/3 into each of the three modes (W, Z, H). These samples were reweighted using generator-level information to allow results to be interpreted for arbitrary sets of branching ratios that are consistent with the three decay modes summing to unity. The generated samples were normalised to the theoretical cross sections computed using Top++ v2.0 [56] at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [57][58][59][60][61], and using the MSTW 2008 NNLO [62,63] set of PDFs. The predicted pair-production cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV ranges from 24 pb for a vector-like quark mass of 350 GeV to 2.0 fb for a mass of 1.5 TeV, with an uncertainty that increases from 8% to 18% over this mass range. The theoretical uncertainties result from variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as from uncertainties in the PDF and \u03b1 S . The latter two represent the largest contribution to the overall theoretical uncertainty in the cross section and were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [64] with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO [65,66] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [54] PDF sets.",

In the case of the 2UED/RPP model, samples were generated for four different values of m KK (from 1 TeV to 1.8 TeV in steps of 200 GeV) and the Bridge [68] generator was used to decay the pair-produced excitations from tier (1,1) generated by Madgraph5.

All backgrounds are estimated using samples of simulated events and initially normalised to their theoretical cross sections, with the exception of the multijet background, which is estimated using data-driven methods. The background prediction is further improved during the statistical analysis by performing a likelihood fit to data using multiple signal-depleted search regions, as discussed in section 6.",

A finer categorisation of tt+\u22651b events is considered for the purpose of applying further corrections and assigning systematic uncertainties associated with the modelling of heavy-flavour production in different topologies [76]. The remaining events are labelled as tt+light-jets events, including those with no additional jets. In previous studies, better agreement between data and prediction was observed, particularly for the top quark p T distribution, when comparing to NNLO calculations [77]. These small improvements to the modelling are incorporated by reweighting all tt samples to match their top quark p T distribution to that predicted at NNLO accuracy in QCD [78,79]. This correction is not applied to tt+\u22651b events, which instead are reweighted to an NLO prediction in the four-flavour (4F) scheme of tt+\u22651b including parton showering [80], based on Sherpa+OpenLoops [47,81] (referred to as SherpaOL in the following) using the CT10 PDF set. This reweighting is performed separately for each of the tt+\u22651b categories in such a way that their inter-normalisation and the shape of the relevant kinematic distributions are at NLO accuracy, while preserving the nominal tt+\u22651b cross section in Powheg-Box+Pythia. The corrections described in this paragraph are applied to the nominal as well as the alternative tt samples.",

            "text": "The background from multijet production (\"multijet background\" in the following) in the 1-lepton channel contributes to the selected data sample via several production and misreconstruction mechanisms. In the electron channel, it consists of non-prompt electrons (from semileptonic b-or c-hadron decays) as well as misidentified photons (e.g. from a conversion of a photon into an e + e \u2212 pair) or jets with a high fraction of their energy deposited in the EM calorimeter. In the muon channel, the multijet background is predominantly from non-prompt muons. The multijet background normalisation and shape are estimated directly from data by using the \"matrix method\" technique [98], which exploits differences in lepton identification and isolation properties between prompt leptons and leptons that are either non-prompt or result from the misidentification of photons or jets. Further details can be found in ref. [25]. The main type of multijet background that contributes to the 0-lepton channel are events in which the energy of a high-p T jet is mismeasured, consequently leading to a large missing transverse momentum in the final state. Most of this background is suppressed by selecting events satisfying \u2206\u03c6 4j min > 0.4. The remaining multijet background in each search region is estimated from a control region defined with the same selection as the search region, but with the selection on \u2206\u03c6 4j min changed to \u2206\u03c6 4j min < 0.1. The normalisation of the multijet background is extrapolated from the control region to its corresponding search region by performing an exponential fit to the \u2206\u03c6 4j min distribution in the range 0 < \u2206\u03c6 4j min < 0.4. The background prediction is validated by comparing the data and total prediction in multijet-rich samples selected by choosing ranges of \u2206\u03c6 4j min (e.g. 0.3 < \u2206\u03c6 4j min < 0.4).",

The presence of high-momentum Z bosons decaying into \u03bd\u03bd or W bosons decaying leptonically, either to an electron or muon that is not reconstructed or to a hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton that is identified as a jet, yields high E miss T , which is exploited by the 0-lepton search. Both searches have some sensitivity to TT \u2192 ZtZt and ZtW b, with Z \u2192 bb. Possible contributions from pair production of the B or X quarks that would be included, along with the T quark, in a weak-isospin doublet are ignored. Such particles are expected to decay primarily through X, B \u2192 W t [8], and thus not lead to high b-tagged jet multiplicity, which is the primary focus of these searches. High jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities are also characteristic of tttt events (both within the SM and in BSM scenarios); this search is sensitive to these events. The four-top-quark production scenarios considered here do not feature large E miss T , so only the 1-lepton search is used to probe them.

The small fraction (about 5%) of background events with \u22652 top-tagged jets or \u22651 Higgs-tagged jets results from the misidentification of at least one large-R jet where initial-or final-state radiation was responsible for a large fraction of the constituents.",

In the following, channels with N t top-tagged jets, N H Higgstagged jets, n jets, and m b-tagged jets are denoted by \"N t t, N H H, nj, mb\". Whenever the top/Higgs-tagging requirement is made on the sum N t + N H \u2261 N tH , the channel is denoted by \"N tH tH, nj, mb\". In addition, events in the 0-lepton channel are further categorised into two regions according to the value of m b T, min , the minimum transverse mass of E miss T and any of the three (or two, in events with exactly two b-tagged jets) leading b-tagged jets in the event: m b T, min < 160 GeV (referred to as \"LM\", standing for \"low mass\") and m b T, min > 160 GeV (referred to as \"HM\", standing for \"high mass\"). This kinematic variable is bounded from above by the top quark mass for semileptonic tt background events, while the signal can have higher values of m b T, min due to the presence of high-p T neutrinos from T \u2192 Zt, Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd or T \u2192 W b, W \u2192 \u03bd decays. Although the requirements of a minimum top/Higgs-tagged jet multiplicity reduces the value of m b T, min because of the resulting stronger collimation of the top quark decay products, this variable still provides useful discrimination between signal and tt background, as shown in figure 4. While the 1-lepton channel only considers regions with exactly 3 or \u22654 b-tagged jets, the 0-lepton channel also includes regions with exactly two b-jets and m b T, min > 160 GeV, to gain sensitivity to TT \u2192 ZtZt decays with at least one Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decay.",

An additional selection requirement of m eff > 1 TeV is made in order to minimise the effect of possible mismodelling of the m eff distribution at low values originating from small backgrounds with large systematic uncertainties, such as multijet production. Such a requirement is applied for regions with N t + N H \u2264 1 in the 1-lepton channel, and for all regions in the 0-lepton channel. Since the TT signal is characterised by having at least one top/Higgs-tagged jet and large values of m eff , this minimum requirement on m eff does not decrease the signal efficiency. In figure 5, the m eff distribution is compared between signal and background for events in signal-rich regions of the 1-lepton and 0-lepton channels. The kinematic requirements in these regions result in a significantly harder m eff spectrum for the background than in regions without top/Higgs-tagged jets, but this variable still shows good discrimination between signal and background.

            "text": "A number of sources of systematic uncertainty affecting the modelling of tt+jets are considered. An uncertainty of 6% is assigned to the inclusive tt production cross section [56], including contributions from varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales, and from uncertainties in the PDF, \u03b1 S , and the top quark mass, all added in quadrature. Since several search regions have a sufficiently large number of events of tt+\u22651b background, its normalisation is completely determined by the data during the fit procedure. In the case of the tt+\u22651c normalisation, since the fit to the data is unable to precisely determine it and the analysis has very limited sensitivity to its uncertainty, a normalisation uncertainty of 50% is assumed. Alternative tt samples were generated using Powheg-Box interfaced to scales set to half the nominal value and using the P2012 radHi UE tune, giving more radiation (referred to as \"radHi\"), and one with the P2012 radLo UE tune, h damp = m t and the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to twice the nominal value, giving less radiation (referred to as \"radLow\") [101]. Uncertainties affecting the modelling of tt+\u22651b production include shape uncertainties (including inter-category migration effects) associated with the NLO prediction from SherpaOL, which is used for reweighting the nominal Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 tt+\u22651b prediction. These uncertainties include different scale variations, a different shower-recoil model scheme, and two alternative PDF sets (see ref. [102] for details), and are significantly smaller than those estimated by comparing different event generators. An uncertainty due to the choice of generator is assessed by comparing the tt+\u22651b predictions obtained after reweighting Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 to the NLO calculation from SherpaOL and to an equivalent NLO calculation from MG5 aMC+Pythia 8, which differs in the procedure used to match the NLO matrix element calculation and the parton shower (see section 1.6.8 of ref. [103]). The uncertainty from the parton shower and hadronisation model is taken from the difference between the MG5 aMC calculation showered with either Pythia8 or Herwig++. Additional uncertainties are assessed for the contributions to the tt+\u22651b background originating from multiple parton interactions or final-state radiation from top quark decay products, which are not part of the NLO prediction. The latter are assessed via the alternative \"radHi\" and \"radLow\" samples, as discussed below. The nominal NLO corrections, as well as their variations used to propagate the theoretical uncertainties in the NLO prediction, are adjusted so that the particle-level cross section of the tt+\u22651b background (i.e. prior to reconstruction-level selection requirements) is fixed to the nominal prediction, i.e. effectively only migrations across categories and distortions to the shape of the kinematic distributions are considered.",

Uncertainties associated with the modelling of ISR/FSR are obtained from the comparison of the Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 \"radHi\" and \"radLow\" samples (see section 5.2) with the nominal Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 sample. An uncertainty associated with the choice of NLO generator is derived by comparing two tt samples, one generated with Powheg-Box+Herwig++ and another generated with MG5 aMC+Herwig++, and propagating the resulting fractional difference to the nominal Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 prediction. An uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation model is derived by comparing events produced by Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia 6 or Herwig++. Finally, the uncertainty in the modelling of the top quark's p T , affecting only the tt+lightjets and tt+\u22651c processes, is evaluated by taking the full difference between applying and not applying the reweighting to match the NNLO prediction. The above uncertainties are taken as uncorrelated between the tt+light-jets, tt+\u22651c and tt+\u22651b processes. In the case of tt+\u22651b, in all instances the various HF categories and the corresponding partonic kinematics for the alternative MC samples are reweighted to match the NLO prediction of SherpaOL so that only effects other than distortions to the inter-normalisation of the various tt+\u22651b topologies and their parton-level kinematics are propagated. In the case of tt+light-jets and tt+\u22651c the full effect of these uncertainties is propagated. Similarly -23 -",

Additional uncertainties associated with the modelling of ISR/FSR are assessed by comparing the nominal samples with alternative samples where generator parameters were varied (i.e. \"radHi\" and \"radLow\"). For the t-and W t-channel processes, an uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation model is derived by comparing events produced by Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia 6 or Herwig++. These uncertainties are treated as fully correlated among single-top production processes, but uncorrelated with the corresponding uncertainty in the tt+jets background. The sum in quadrature of the above uncertainties on the single top normalisation at the preselection level is 20% in the 1-lepton channel and 20%(25%) in LM(HM) regions of the 0-lepton channel, respectively. An additional systematic uncertainty on W t-channel production concerning the separation between tt and W t at NLO [104] is assessed by comparing the nominal sample, which uses the so-called \"diagram subtraction\" scheme, with an alternative sample using the \"diagram removal\" scheme. This uncertainty, which is taken to be single-sided, has a strong shape dependence and affects the W t normalisation by about \u221250% in the 1-lepton channel and LM regions of the 0-lepton channel, and by about \u221275% in HM regions of the 0-lepton channel. Due to the small size of the simulated samples, and hence limited statistical precision, these uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated in each analysis region and so their estimates at the preselection level are used instead. They are treated as uncorrelated across regions with different top-tagged jet and Higgs-tagged jet multiplicities and between the 1-lepton and 0-lepton channels.",

The total normalisation uncertainty of V +jets processes is estimated by comparing the data and total background prediction in the different analysis regions considered, but requiring exactly 0 b-tagged jets. Agreement between data and predicted background in these modified regions, which are dominated by V +light-jets, is found to be within approximately 30%.

Recent comparisons between data and Sherpa 2.1.1 for W Z(\u2192 \u03bd )+ \u22654 jets show agreement within the experimental uncertainty of approximately 40% [108], which further justifies the above uncertainty.

The post-fit yields in five of the most sensitive search regions in the 1-lepton and 0-lepton channels can be found in tables 6 and 7, respectively. For the same search regions, the corresponding m eff distributions, both before and after the fit to data, are shown in figures 9-13. The binning used for the m eff distributions in the different search regions represents a compromise between preserving enough discrimination between the background and the different signal hypotheses considered, and keeping the statistical uncertainty on the background prediction per bin well below 30%. While some of the systematic uncertainties from individual sources described in section 7 vary across the m eff spectrum, the total pre-fit uncertainty is largely independent of m eff . The large number of events in the signal-depleted regions, together with their different background compositions, and the assumptions of the fit model, constrain the combined effect of the sources of systematic uncertainty. As a result, an improved background prediction is obtained with significantly reduced uncertainty, not only in the signal-depleted channels, but also in the signal-rich channels such as (\u22650t, \u22652H, \u22656j, \u22654b) in the 1-lepton channel.",

In particular, one of the main corrections determined in the fit is a scale factor that multiplies the tt+\u22651b normalisation by 0.90\u00b10.23 relative to the nominal prediction. 6 In addition, the nuisance parameter controlling the tt+\u22651c normalisation is adjusted to scale this background by a factor of 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 relative to its nominal prediction. The fit results in better agreement between data and prediction in the channels with \u22653 b-tagged jets, where the tt+HF background dominates. Detailed studies were performed to verify the stability of the fit against variations in the treatment of the systematic uncertainties affecting the tt+HF background (e.g. by decorrelating normalisation and shape uncertainties between different tt+\u22651b categories, or by scaling the tt+\u22651b and tt+\u22651c backgrounds by a common factor), finding in all instances a robust post-fit background prediction. Furthermore, the impact on the background-only fit of injecting a TT signal (with m T = 1 TeV) in the doublet configuration was confirmed to be negligible. Although there is no single nuisance parameter directly responsible for the normalisation of tt+light-jets background, the yields for this contribution within each region are affected by systematic uncertainties in the tt modelling and the jet flavour tagging, and thus are changed after the fit.",

Agreement between data and prediction in normalisation and shape of the m eff distribution for these regions, which are not used in the fit, is generally improved after the fit, giving confidence in the overall procedure. To increase the background yields and strengthen the validation of the fit strategy, comparisons between data and background prediction, before and after the fit, are performed for more-inclusive event selections. As an example, the distributions of two kinematic variables used to define the search strategy can be found in figures 15 and 16. They display respectively the Higgs-tagged jet multiplicity in the 1-lepton channel, after requiring at least 6 jets and 3 b-jets, and the distribution of the m b T, min variable in the 0-lepton channel for events containing at least 7 jets and 2 b-jets, together with at least one top/Higgs-tagged jet. Although these variables are not directly used in the fit, a good description of the data by the post-fit background prediction is observed, which further validates the fitting procedure.

To probe this branching ratio plane, the signal samples are reweighted by the ratio of the desired branching ratio to the original branching ratio in Protos, and the complete analysis is repeated. Owing to the complementarity of the 1-lepton and 0-lepton searches in probing the branching ratio plane, their combination represents a significant improvement over the individual results, as illustrated in figure 18. In this case, the observed lower limits on the T quark mass range between 0.99 TeV and 1.43 TeV depending on the values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes. In particular, a vector-like T quark with mass below 0.99 TeV is excluded for any values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes. The corresponding range of expected lower limits is between 0.91 TeV and 1.34 TeV.
