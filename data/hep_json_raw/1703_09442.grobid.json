By scattering high-energy electrons off a proton we are able to resolve its fundamental constituents and probe their momenta and positions. Here we investigate the dynamics of quarks and gluons inside nucleons using deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS)-a highly virtual photon scatters off the proton, which subsequently radiates a photon. DVCS interferes with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, where the photon is emitted by the electron rather than the proton. We report herein the full determination of the BH-DVCS interference by exploiting the distinct energy dependences of the DVCS and BH amplitudes. In the regime where the scattering is expected to occur off a single quark, measurements show an intriguing sensitivity to gluons, the carriers of the strong interaction.",

At a distance scale of the nucleon radius, perturbative computations cannot be performed because of the large value of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S . To unravel the internal dynamics of the nucleon and answer fundamental questions from the origin of its spin to the mechanism of confinement, lepton-scattering experiments have proven to be a powerful tool. Indeed, elastic scattering allows to access the transverse spatial distribution of charge and current in the nucleon through measurements of its electric and magnetic form factors, whereas parton distribution functions measured in deep inelastic experiments provide information on the longitudinal momentum carried by the confined quarks and gluons. Developed in the mid-90s, the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [1][2][3] provide a higher level of information and encode correlations between the transverse position and the longitudinal momentum of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon 4 . Being a 1 2 -spin particle, the nucleon is described by four chiral-even GPDs H; E;H;\u1ebc \u00c8 \u00c9",

The CFFs are also classified according to the inverse power of Q ffiffiffiffiffi ffi Q 2 p with which they enter the DVCS amplitude. This power is called the twist, and is equal to the dimension minus the spin of the corresponding operator. The leading-twist (LT) CFFs are F \u00fe\u00fe and F \u00c0\u00fe , which are twist-2. CFFs F 0\u00fe are twist-3, i.e., 1 Q -suppressed with respect to the LT CFFs.

The contamination caused by asymmetric \u03c0 0 decays with respect to the pion momentum was estimated by simulating thousands of decays for each \u03c0 0 identified in the data and computing the likelihood for each to yield only one photon in the experimental acceptance. The subtraction of N acc was performed by analyzing events where the scattered electron and the detected photon were not in coincidence. In addition, we applied a 800 MeV energy cut on the photon to remove most of the accidental background and required a value of M 2 X > 0:5 GeV 2 to increase the signal/background ratio (Fig. 3). We also applied a M 2 X <1 GeV 2 cut so that N SIDIS is < 1% of exclusive N ep\u2192ep\u03b3 events. The significant fraction of exclusive photon events with a missing mass squared higher than M 2 C is corrected by applying the same cut to the Monte-Carlo simulation used to compute the experimental acceptance. This fraction of events removed varies from bin to bin since the width and position of the exclusive signal may slightly change from one bin to another. The compact experimental setup provides a very flat geometrical acceptance, except at the edges of the detectors, where it drops to 75-30% depending on the kinematic setting. The energy resolution of the calorimeter was smeared locally in order to match the missing mass resolution observed in the experimental data, and the pointto-point systematic uncertainty associated to the exclusivity cut estimated to be 2%.",

Indeed, when the beam energy changes, not only do the contributions of the DVCS-BH interference and DVCS 2 terms change but also the polarization of the virtual photon changes, thereby modifying the weight of the different helicity amplitudes.

This fit reproduces very poorly the angular distribution of the data yielding a value of \u03c7 2 /ndf = 415/208. Indeed, the strong enhancement of the cos\u03d5-harmonics in the DVCS 2 amplitude originated by the large size of \u03c7 0 translates into the bump in the dashed line around \u03d5 = 180\u00b0for E beam = 5.550 GeV. Two additional fits were performed including either H 0\u00fe ;H 0\u00fe \u00c8 \u00c9 to include genuine twist-3 contributions or H \u00c0\u00fe ;H \u00c0\u00fe \u00c8 \u00c9 to include gluon-transversity GPD contributions arising at NLO . In both of these latter fits E \u00fe\u00fe and\u1ebc \u00fe\u00fe , expected to have the smallest contributions, were set to zero, thus keeping constant the number of free parameters.

The fit to the data is much better (\u03c7 2 /ndf = 190/208) for both the higher-twist (HT) or the NLO scenarios than for the LO/LT case. This conclusion also holds for the lower \u2212t bins, as summarized in Table 2. We observe the crucial role of gluons in the description of the process, either through the quark-gluon correlations involved in HT diagrams or  through next-to-leading effects implying gluon-transversity GPDs. This pioneer analysis including the kinematical power corrections recently calculated for DVCS demonstrate that the LT approximation is no longer sufficient to describe the accuracy of these new data. Within both successful fit scenarios, the DVCS 2 and the BH-DVCS interference terms are well separated, as presented in Fig. 5: we denote this procedure a generalized Rosenbluth separation. In particular, we note a significant DVCS 2 contribution in the HT scenario to the helicity-dependent cross section, assumed to be a purely interference term in DVCS phenomenology up to now. In addition, the real part of the BH-DVCS interference (helicity-independent cross section) is extracted in these kinematics.",

Using this data set, we demonstrated the sensitivity of high-precision DVCS data to twist-3 and/or higher-order contributions through a phenomenological study including kinematical power corrections. Within either a pure HT or a pure NLO scenario, both legitimate at our moderate values of Q 2 , a statistically significant experimental separation of the DVCS 2 and DVCS-BH interference terms is achieved. While HT effects in GPD models 30,31 are of the order of magnitude observed, no numerical estimate of NLO contributions due to gluontransversity GPDs are available. Advances in global analyses can include these next-order contributions, rich with information about parton correlations inside the nucleon 32,33 . Finally, a new program has started at Jefferson Lab to measure deep virtual exclusive scattering with electron beams up to 11 GeV. For a given x B , the reach in Q 2 will span at least a factor of two. This broader reach provides the potential to discriminate between the two scenarios (HT or NLO), as the cross sections in the two scenarios (for the same GPDs) have different energy and Q 2 dependencies at fixed x B .",
