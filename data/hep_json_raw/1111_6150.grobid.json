            "text": "The aim to improve our understanding of the confinement mechanism and of the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the non-perturbative region of QCD is the driving force behind the intense efforts to clarify the spectrum of meson [1] and baryon [2] resonances. The systematics of the baryon ground states were constitutive for the development of quark models. In the harmonic oscillator (h.o.) approximation, the quark model predicts a ladder of baryon resonances with equidistant squared masses, alternating with positive and negative parity, and this pattern survives approximately in more realistic potentials (see, e.g. [3,4]). Recent lattice gauge calculations [5] confirm these findings. However, masses of resonances with positive and negative parities are often similar, in striking disagreement with quark models and the results on the lattice. A second problem of both, lattice calculations and quark models, is the number of expected states which is considerably larger than confirmed experimentally, a fact which is known as problem of missing resonances. The number of expected states is much reduced if it is assumed that two quarks form a quasistable diquark [6]. Of particular importance is thus the possible existence of a quartet of positive-parity nucleon resonances with total angular momentum J = 1/2, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , 7/2 -called N 1/2 + , N 3/2 + , N 5/2 + , N 7/2 + here and expected at about 2 GeV -with wave functions which in h.o. approximation have intrinsic angular orbital momentum L = 2 and a total quark-spin angular momentum S = 3/2. In quark models, the three quarks are antisymmetric with respect to their color degree of freedom, the states have a symmetric spin wave function, the nucleon flavor wave function is of mixed-symmetry. The spatial wave function must hence be of mixed symmetry, too. This is impossible when one quark pair forms a diquark in S-wave. The existence of these four states would rule out any diquark model respecting the Pauli principle. It is this consequence that led Nathan Isgur [7], more than 20 years ago, to consider the existence of this quartet to be one of the most important open issues in baryon spectroscopy. Unfortunately, this question is still not yet answered.",

Of decisive importance for the results reported here are the recent high-precision data on photoproduction of the \u039b hyperon. In the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u039bK + , the initial photon can be polarized linearly or circularly, the polarization of the outgoing \u039b can be constructed from its parity-violating \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay.

To construct the multipoles governing the process for discrete energy bins in an energy-independent partial wave analysis, experiments with polarized target protons would be required in addition.

Inelastic reactions are no longer a black box, they are constrained by high-precision data. Yet, many data do not cover the full angular range, and polarization information is still not complete. Presumably, this is the reason why the fit to the data does not converge to a well-defined minimum. However, in minima with a good \u03c7 2 , the properties of baryon are rather stable. Their spread in a large variety of fits is used to define error bars. In some partial waves, the results are ambiguous; then both solutions are discussed. The two solutions are called BnGa2011-1 and BnGa2011-2. For technical rea-sons, reactions with three-body final states are not included in the fits in mass scans described below.",

Thus a significant contribution from N 1/2 + (1710) should be expected. The long tail may indicate the need for a further resonance at higher mass. We therefore used a four-pole K-matrix amplitude to fit the data: a first pole at the nucleon mass as Born term, followed by the well known Roper resonance at 1440 MeV [22], and two further poles. If both these resonances are omitted from the fit, the fit exhibits problems to reproduce the differential cross sections and the recoil asymmetry. The contributions from the J P = 1 2 + wave to \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 K 0 \u039b and \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 K 0 \u03a3 become smaller and featureless. The description significantly improves when N 1/2 + (1710) is introduced. Its pole is found at (1687 \u00b1 17) \u2212 i (95 \u00b1 17) MeV, averaged over all solutions BG2011. The overall description is notably improved when a further K-matrix pole in the 1870 MeV region is introduced in the fit. The resonance was first suggested in [16]. The pole position of the amplitude optimizes for M pole = 1905\u00b135 \u2212 i(85\u00b120) MeV in the first class of the solutions and at M pole = 1870\u00b125 \u2212 i(140\u00b118) MeV in the second class of the solutions.

This type of fits produced \u03c7 2 values which were much worse than the one obtained in the four-pole K-matrix solution. Nevertheless, the best mass of the Breit-Wigner state was found at 1855 MeV, but the contribution of this state to the cross sections is very small. It had very weak pion-nucleon and photo-couplings. As the result, a mass scan -as done for the other resonances discussed below -did not show a clear minimum. Thus we conclude that this state creates an interference pattern which can be reproduced only in an approach which takes into account the interference between different poles properly. The situation is similar to the interference of the two J P = 1 2 \u2212 resonances at 1535 and 1650 MeV. Their pattern can also not be described with reasonably accuracy using Breit-Wigner amplitudes. A scan like the ones shown for the N 3/2 + (1900), N 5/2 + (2000), and N 7/2 + (1990) is thus not possible. Instead, we show in Fig. 2 some selected data and a fit with N 1/2 + (1880) and a fit when N 1/2 + (1880) is removed from the list of resonances.

Above this resonance, a further state has been reported by several groups (see references in [8]), but with masses which vary from 1814 MeV to 2175 MeV. In [9,11], the evidence for this second N 5/2 + state was derived from the small structure in amplitude (Fig. 1c) at about 1.9 GeV which is present in the energy independent analysis from KH and GWU, although the structure looks rather different in the two analyses.

The results of the GWU energy-independent partial wave analysis are shown in Fig. 1d,h,  A second pole definitely improves the description but the associated pole is ill-defined, its position is somewhere between 2300 and 2500 MeV, the width is large, about 500 MeV. The main improvements come from the lower-mass pole.",

Here, D is the SU(6) dimensionality, L is the intrinsic orbital angular momentum, P the parity and N the shell number in the harmonic oscillator approximation. This assignment excludes conventional diquark models: A S-wave diquark is symmetric with respect to the exchange of the two quarks, a third quark with even angular momentum is symmetric with respect to the diquark, the isospin wave function of a nucleon resonance is of mixed-symmetry. Hence the overall spin-flavor-spatial wave function is of mixed symmetry. With an antisymmetric color wave function, the overall wave function has no defined exchange symmetry: the Pauli principle is violated. The assignment of the four states to a spin quartet, particularly favored for the solution in which the N 7/2 + (1990) mass is 1980 MeV, rules out the possibility that the missing resonance problem is due to a freezing of one pair of quarks into a quasi-stable S-wave diquark.",

In this case, the nucleon quartet could be compatible with the assumption of \"stable\" diquarks. Do we have evidence for this possibility? In the ground states, the Pauli principle is certainly realized. If the Pauli principle is not imposed for the lowest-mass negative-parity states, the pattern in the nucleon sector -a spin-doublet (N 1/2 \u2212 (1535), N 3/2 \u2212 (1520)) and a spin triplet (N 1/2 \u2212 (1650), N 3/2 \u2212 (1700), N 5/2 \u2212 (1675) -should also be observed in the \u2206 sector. However, the doublet (\u2206 1/2 \u2212 (1620), \u2206 3/2 \u2212 (1700)) seems to be too far separated in mass from the triplet (\u2206 1/2 \u2212 (1900), \u2206 3/2 \u2212 (1940), \u2206 5/2 \u2212 (1930). Thus the Pauli principle is required to understand the pattern for L = 1. When the Pauli principle is given up for L = 2, a doublet of positive parity \u2206 states 3 2 + and 5 2 + is predicted in the region 1.7-1.8 GeV. Although an observation of the \u2206 5/2 + state in the region 1750 MeV was reported by [25] and [30], we did not find any indication for this state in our present analysis. Hence we conclude that also for L = 2, the Pauli principle is applicable.",

In solution BG2011-02, the two high-mass poles are found at (1870 \u00b135) \u2212 i (155 \u00b120) MeV and (1955 \u00b1 30) \u2212 i(115 \u00b1 20) MeV, respectively. The latter resonance is tentatively called N 3/2 + (1975) here. In the solution BG2011-01, this structure is not observed. Here the second pole is seen at (1910 \u00b1 12) \u2212 i(100 \u00b1 8) MeV and the third pole is ill defined only. It has a rather large width (more than 600 MeV) and its mass is located in the region 2100-2300 MeV.We should expect that two close-by resonances like N 3/2 + (1900) and N 3/2 + (1975) should chose different decay modes. A well known example for such a pattern are the decays of the two meson resonances K 1 (1280) and K 1 (1400) where the first resonance decays prominently into K\u03c1, the latter one into K * \u03c0. Here, only the photo-couplings of N 3/2 + (1900) and N 3/2",
