            "text": "The main goals of the high energy nuclear collisions are to explore the phase structure of strongly interacting hot and dense nuclear matter and map the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram which can be displayed in the two dimensions (temperature (T) vs. baryon chemical potential (\u00b5 B )). Fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as net-baryon (\u2206N B ), net-charge (\u2206N Q ) and net-strangeness (\u2206N S ), have been predicted to be sensitive to the QCD phase transition and the QCD critical point [1][2][3]. The cumulants of the event-by-event distributions of these conserved quantities are directly connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities computed with Lattice QCD [4][5][6] and in the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model [7][8][9][10]. Thus, those cumulant ratios are equivalent to the ratios of various order susceptibilities as C 4 /C 2 = \u03c7 (4) i /\u03c7 (2) i and C 3 /C 2 = \u03c7 (3) i /\u03c7 (2) i , where i indicates the conserved quantity. Experimentally, we use net-kaon (\u2206N K ) as proxy for net-strangeness. The fluctuations of conserved quantities have been widely studied experimentally and theoretically [1-3, 7, 11-14]. In this work, we report recent efficiency-corrected cumulants and cumulant ratios of the net-kaon (\u2206N K ) multiplicity distributions measured in Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 7. 7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV collected in 2010, 2011, and 2014 by STAR at RHIC.",

The K + (K \u2212 ) for net-kaon analysis are measured at mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) within the transverse momentum region 0.2<p T <1.6 GeV/c. For the centrality selection, the uncorrected multiplicity distribution of primary charged particles, excluding kaons/anti-kaons within |\u03b7|<1.0 has been used for \u2206N K to avoid autocorrelations. The results are corrected for a finite centrality bin width [15]. intervals. We observe that most central collisions have a wider distribution compared with peripheral collision.
