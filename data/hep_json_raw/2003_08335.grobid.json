            "text": "The first observed D-wave charmonium state was the \u03c8(3770), which can be produced in e + e \u2212 collisions directly [1] (note that the \u03c8(3770) is predominantly 1 3 D 1 state, but includes an admixture of S-wave vector charmonia [2]). Other D-wave charmonium states can be produced in b-hadron decays, hadronic transitions from other charmonium states, or directly in hadron collisions. Evidence for the \u03c8 2 (1D) was first found by the Belle collaboration in the decays B + \u2192 \u03c8 2 (1D)(\u2192 \u03c7 c1 (\u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3)\u03b3)K + [3]; this state was later observed by BESIII in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 2 (1D)(\u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03b3)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [4]. A candidate for the \u03c8 3 (1D) state, the X(3842), was recently observed by the LHCb collaboration using direct production in pp collisions [5]. The 1 1 D 2 charmonium state, the \u03b7 c2 (1D), has not been observed experimentally yet. Various potential models [2,[6][7][8] predict that the masses of the \u03b7 c2 (1D) and \u03c8 2 (1D) are very close to each other (see also the summary table in ref. [9]). While the predicted \u03b7 c2 (1D) mass can vary by up to 70 MeV/c 2 between models, the typical value of the mass difference between the \u03b7 c2 (1D) and \u03c8 2 (1D) in a given model is about 2 MeV/c 2 . Lattice calculations [10,11] also find that the \u03b7 c2 (1D) and \u03c8 2 (1D) masses are close to each other. The mass difference calculated from the results of ref. [11] is m \u03b7 c2 (1D) \u2212 m \u03c8 2 (1D) = 9 \u00b1 10 MeV/c 2 assuming uncorrelated uncertainties, where the uncertainty is statistical only.",

By default, the distribution is assumed to be uniform. As an alternative, the decay is assumed to proceed via the intermediate K * (892) resonance. Two possible K * (892) polarizations are considered: \u03bb K * (892) = \u00b11 and \u03bb K * (892) = 0, where \u03bb K * (892) is the K * (892) helicity. The angular distribution of the K * (892) decay is given by |d 1 \u03bb K * (892) 0 (\u03b8 K * (892) )| 2 , where d is the Wigner d-function, and \u03b8 K * (892) is the K * (892) helicity angle (the angle between \u2212 p \u03b7 c2 (1D) and p K , where p \u03b7 c2 (1D) and p K are the momenta of the \u03b7 c2 (1D) and K in the K * (892) rest frame, respectively). The maximal deviations of the efficiency for alternative amplitude models from the default one are considered as systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties are found to be 15.0% and 9.5% for B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 c2 (1D)\u03c0 \u2212 K + and B + \u2192 \u03b7 c2 (1D)\u03c0 + K 0 S , respectively.",

There are gaps without any events, where the likelihood is a continuously increasing function of the signal yield for all allowed values of the yield (such values that the overall fitting function is positive). Thus, it is necessary to switch to event counting. The counting region is chosen to be within \u00b11.5(\u03c3 1 + \u03c3 2 )/2 from the current value of mass, where \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 are the parameters of the narrow asymmetric Gaussian used in the resolution fit.
