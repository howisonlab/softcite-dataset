They can provide a three-dimensional picture of how the quarks and gluons form a nucleon. GPDs can be probed experimentally in hard exclusive meson production or deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). The COMPASS experiment at CERN is a unique place to study these reactions. At COMPASS, a high energy polarized positive or negative muon beam is scattered off a polarized or unpolarized fixed target. First results for exclusive \u03c1 0 meson production are shown. The transverse target spin asymmetry for exclusively produced \u03c1 0 on a transversely polarized deuteron target has been measured. Prospects for future measurements of DVCS and exclusive meson production at COMPASS will be shown. The experiment will use the existing COMPASS spectrometer with a new target, a new recoil detector and extended calorimetry. Simulations for different models and a test of the recoil detector have been performed.",

Due to the high energy of the muon beam available at COMPASS (between 100 and 190 GeV) the kinematic range covered by the proposed GPD program will be large enough to provide a bridge between the HERA collider experiments 9,10 at very small x bj and the JLAB 11,12 and HERMES 13 experiments at large x bj (Fig. 3). The measurements of generalized parton distributions at COMPASS will be performed with an unpolarized liquid hydrogen or deuterium target surrounded by a recoil detector. 8 The CERN beam-line can provide both positive and negative muons with opposite polarization of 80%. For beam charge asymmetry measurements the beam charge can be changed once a day. The goal of the experiment is to measure the cross section as well as spin and charge asymmetries as a function of x bj , Q 2 and t. At 190 GeV, the DVCS process is dominant over the competing Bethe-Heitler process and the cross section can be measured. At 100 GeV, the possibility to use muon beams of opposite charge and polarization will allow to measure the charge and spin asymmetries arising from the interference between DVCS and the Bethe-Heitler process. Measurements of the cross section difference of oppositely charged and polarized muons give access to the real part of the DVCS amplitude, while the cross section sum provides information about the imaginary part of the DVCS amplitude. 14,15 These observables have great sensitivity to GPD models. 16 Hard exclusive meson production cross sections will also be measured at the same time providing different constraints on GPDs.",

The interaction will take place in a newly designed 2.5 m long liquid hydrogen or deuterium target. It will be surrounded by a recoil detector for the detection of the recoiling particles and to insure exclusivity of the reaction. It will use the time-of-flight technique to determine the recoiling proton momentum with a few percent precision. The recoil detector will consist of two concentric barrels of scintillators read at both sides. To allow for 10 bins in t, a minimum time resolution of 300 ps is needed. A full size prototype has been tested in the COMPASS experimental area in fall 2006 and achieved a time resolution of 310 ps. In case of DVCS, the photon will be detected in the existing forward calorimeters, an additional wide angle calorimeter covering lab angles up to 20 degrees will be added to improve the acceptance at high x bj and to reject the \u03c0 0 background.",

Data taking could start with the full set-up as early as 2010. Therefore first results are expected well before possible future projects at the JLAB 12 GeV upgrade and the FAIR project at the GSI.",
