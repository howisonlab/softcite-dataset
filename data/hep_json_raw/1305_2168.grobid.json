The differential branching fraction is determined in bins of q 2 , the invariant dimuon mass squared. Integration over the full q 2 range yields a total branching fraction of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 7.07 +0.64 \u22120.59 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b1 0.71 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third originates from the branching fraction of the normalisation channel. An angular analysis is performed to determine the angular observables F L , S 3 , A 6 , and A 9 . The observables are consistent with Standard Model expectations.",

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The LHCb trigger system [4] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction.",

In the narrow \u03c6 mass window, 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 misidentified B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates are expected within \u00b150 MeV/c 2 of the known B 0 s mass of 5366 MeV/c 2 [12]. The resonant decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 can also constitute a source of peaking background if the K + (K \u2212 ) is misidentified as \u00b5 + (\u00b5 \u2212 ) and vice versa. Similarly, the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 (K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) where the \u03c0 \u2212 (\u00b5 \u2212 ) is misidentified as \u00b5 \u2212 (K \u2212 ) can mimic the signal decay. These backgrounds are rejected by requiring that the invariant mass of the K + \u00b5 \u2212 (K \u2212 \u00b5 + ) system, with kaons reconstructed under the muon mass hypothesis, is not within \u00b150 MeV/c 2 around the known J/\u03c8 mass of 3096 MeV/c 2 [12], unless both the kaon and the muon pass stringent particle identification criteria. The expected number of background events from double misidentification in the B 0 s signal mass region is 0.9 \u00b1 0.5. All other backgrounds studied, including semileptonic",

The determination of the differential branching fraction is performed in six bins of q 2 , given in table 1, and corresponds to the binning chosen for the analysis of the decayB 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [15].Figure 2 shows the K + K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mass distribution in the six q 2 bins. The signal yields are determined by extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits to the reconstructed B 0 s mass distributions. The signal component is modeled by a double Gaussian function. The resolution parameters are obtained from the resonant B 0s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decay. A q 2 -dependent scaling factor, determined with simulated B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events, is introduced to account for the observed q 2 dependence of the mass resolution. The combinatorial background is described by a single exponential function. The veto of the radiative tails of the charmonium resonances is accounted for by using a scale factor. The resulting signal yields are given in table 1. Fitting for the signal yield over the full q 2 region, 174 \u00b1 15 signal candidates are found.
