The measurement of CP violation in the leptonic sector of the Standard Model is a very challenging goal and sensitivity studies suggest that it is desirable to reduce systematic errors in this measurement to the level of 1 \u2212 3%. One of the most important sources of systematical error is the neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections. In the 1 \u2212 5 GeV energy region they are known with a precision not exceeding 20%. In actual experimental setup thanks to information from a near detector many uncertainties cancel but significant experimental and theoretical effort to understand better neutrino interactions is necessary.",

However, much higher statistics data will soon become available from the MicroBooNE experiment. It seems important to perform Monte Carlo studies inspired by the ArgoNeuT results in order to identify promising observables in future experiments. ArgoNeuT investigated a sample of events with no pions and two reconstructed protons. ArgoNeuT main interest is a search for the short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs within the argon nuclei. Two interesting observables have been identified. The first one is a distribution of angles between two protons in the laboratory frame. It was noticed that there are many proton pairs in almost back-to-back configuration. ArgoNeuT also looked for two body current events trying to reconstruct initial nucleon-nucleon configuration. The conclusion was that there is an excess of events with back-to-back initial nucleon-nucleon state. The goal of this paper is to analyze ArgoNeuT discoveries using NuWro Monte Carlo event generator [13]. The main question is whether physical models implemented in NuWro are sufficient to explain the ArgoNeuT results. Or, perhaps the ArgoNeuT discoveries point to more sophisticated nuclear physics that should be included in neutrino MC simulation tools.",

The wire-planes, both made from 240 wires each and rotated \u00b160 \u2022 to the beam plane, allow for the identification of signals from individual wires. As in liquid argon there is no charge multiplication, the signal pulse height is proportional to the amount of ionization charge in the track segment. Therefore summing the charge over the entire track length gives us the calorimetric information. Combining data from both wire-planes, that have drift coordinate in common, one can fully reconstruct three-dimensional image of the event. For particles having contained tracks within the TPC energy loss is a function of distance. This dependence is a powerful tool for the particle identification. For uncontained muons escaping in the forward direction, the momentum and charge identification was performed using the MINOS Near Detector (MINOS-ND) calorimeter located downstream from ArgoNeuT.",

For the reader's orientation, protons with momentum 500 MeV/c travel average distance of 12.2 cm. For each event we uniformly draw a position of occurance within the TPC (47x40x90 cm 3 ). Then using Eq. 3we calculate the length of track for each proton. Attaching the length to the actual proton momentum directions, we can decide if the track is fully contained in the TPC. Events with uncontained proton tracks are discarded. The fluxes (NuMI LE) used in the simulations were provided to us by the ArgoNeuT Collaboration. In the analysis ArgoNeuT Collaboration used neutrino events from both (neutrino and antineutrino) runs. NuWro simulation normalization is defined not by numbers of two proton events in both modes identified by ArgoNeuT but rather by the overall numbers of neutrino charge current events in two runs. The numbers of such events are 729 and 3759 in \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 modes respectively, so that in the NuWro simulation we produced 2916000 and 15036000 neutrino charge current events in two modes to keep their relative fractions fixed.",

We investigated how well the measured distribution of missing transverse momentum is reproduced by NuWro. Fig. 4 shows a distribution of p T miss from 29 ArgoNeuT two proton events (one of the events exceeded the histogram range). The distribution obtained with NuWro is shown also, and the NuWro results are normalized to the same histogram area. We notice the enhancement of the events in the first bin (almost zero p T miss ) in the SF NuWro configuration. If both nucleons from the initial correlated nucleon pair did not suffer from FSI effects the missing transverse momentum is exactly zero (in the NuWro SF mode nucleons in the initial correlated state have opposite threemomenta).

            "text": "We investigated how reliable the procedure is to reconstruct the initial nucleon-nucleon configuration in the restricted subsample of 15 events. We calculated distributions of differences between reconstructed and true values of three quantities: neutrino energy, the value of threemomentum transfer and the three-momentum transfer direction. The results are shown in Table III, where \u00b5 is the mean value and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. The reconstruction formula tends to underestimate the neutrino energy and therefore, the value of threemomentum transfer. This is due to presence of undetected neutrons in the final state. In larger liquid argon detectors like MicroBooNE, the kinetic energy carried away by neutrons may be partially seen via interac- tion with visible energy deposit making the reconstruction more precise. On the other hand, the direction of the three-momentum transfer is reconstructed quite accurately. Finally, we would like to address the problem of the shape of the cos \u03b3 i distribution. Momentum conservation implies that there is a correlation between q, q rec and both nucleon three-momenta: p 1 and p 2 . Using NuWro, we checked that the distribution of cos( q rec , p 1 ) is peaked at \u223c 0.85. The distribution of cos( q rec , p 2 ) is more diffused with a maximum at \u223c 0.6. The correlation between q rec and nucleon three-momenta is smeared out by FSI effects and becomes weaker for events with larger number of nucleon rescatterings inside nucleus. Neglecting contribution from non-detected neutrons and nucleus recoil one can expect that q \u2248 p1 + p2 and q \u2248 q rec . It is now clear that, if we define p i 1 \u2261 p 1 \u2212 q rec , as done in the Ar-goNeuT paper, we should expect that p i 1 and p 2 will tend to be anti-parallel. Nuclear effects like Fermi motion and most importantly FSI make the relation between p i 1 and p 2 more complicated, but the basic feature of the distribution seen in Fig. 3, namely the peak in cos \u03b3 i at -1, can be understood with presented above simple kinematical considerations. The shape seen in Fig. 3 is universal and does not depend much on the dynamical mechanism behind the appearance of the two proton final state.",

Better statistics data from awaited liquid argon Micro-BooNE experiment will allow us to understand better the situation.
