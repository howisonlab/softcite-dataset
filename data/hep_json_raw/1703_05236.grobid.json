The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . Results are interpreted in the context of a Z -two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended by a U(1) Z group, with a new massive Z gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like scalar Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m Zm A phase space. For example, the observed data exclude the Z mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for Z coupling strength g Z = 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles g \u03c7 = 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan \u03b2 = 1, and m A = 300 GeV. The results of this analysis are valid for any dark matter particle mass below 100 GeV.",

            "text": "Astrophysical observations have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) in the universe [1]. However, its underlying nature remains unknown and cannot be accommodated within the standard model (SM). The recent discovery of a Higgs boson with mass of about 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [2][3][4] provides an additional handle to probe the dark sector beyond the SM. As explained below, in the analyses presented here, it is assumed that there are five physical Higgs bosons, and that the new state corresponds to the light neutral CP-even state h. If DM has origin in particle physics, and if other than gravitational interactions exist between DM and SM particles, DM particles (\u03c7) could be produced at the CERN LHC. One way to observe DM particles would be through their recoil against a SM particle X (X = g, q, \u03b3, Z, W, or h) that is produced in association with the DM. This associated production of DM and SM particles is often referred to as mono-X production. The SM particle X can be emitted directly from a quark or gluon as initial-state radiation, or through a new interaction between DM and SM particles, or as final-state radiation. The Higgs boson radiation from an initial-state quark or gluon is suppressed through Yukawa or loop processes, respectively. A scenario in JHEP10(2017)180 which the Higgs boson is part of the interaction producing the DM particles gives monoh searches a uniquely enhanced sensitivity to the structure of couplings between the SM particles and the dark matter [5][6][7]. At the LHC, searches for DM in the mono-h channel have been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration using data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 20 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV and 3.2 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, through the decay channels h \u2192 bb [8,9] and h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [10].",

It can be seen from eq. (1.1) that g Z = 0.8 is the maximum allowed value of g Z for tan \u03b2 = 1 and m Z = 1.7 TeV (the best reach of LHC as estimated by ref. [7]). Note that this analysis does not consider the contribution of another decay that gives a similar mono-h signature: Z \u2192 Zh where Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd. The ratio of branching fractions, B(Z \u2192 Zh, Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)/B(Z \u2192 Ah, A \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7), is a function of tan \u03b2 and m Z and does not depend on g Z since the value of g Z cancels in the ratio. The h \u2192 bb decay mode has the largest branching fraction (\u224858%) of all, but suffers from relatively poor mass resolution of about 10%, and while the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction is small (\u22480.2%), the channel benefits from the high precision in reconstructed diphoton mass, with a resolution of about 1-2%. In the h \u2192 bb channel, the fact that the p T of the h should increase with m Z and decrease with m A is exploited. The minimum separation in the pseudorapidity and azimuth (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane between the decay products of h scales as m h /p h T , where p h T is the transverse momentum of the h boson. The allowed mass ranges of m Z and m A imply a very wide range of values for p h T and consequently a wide range in the separation of the decay products. Analysis in this channel is therefore divided into two regimes: (i) a resolved regime where the h decays to two distinct reconstructed b jets, and (ii) a Lorentzboosted regime where the h is reconstructed as a single fat jet. For each mass point, the analysis with best sensitivity for the expected limit is used as the final result. The signal extraction is performed through a simultaneous fit to the signal-and background-enriched control regions.",

Charged particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip tracker system, covering 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The electromagnetic calorimeter, which surrounds the tracker volume, consists of 75,848 lead tungstate crystals that provide coverage in pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.48 in the barrel region (EB) and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.0 in two endcap regions (EE). The EB modules are arranged in projective towers. A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of three radiation lengths of lead is located in front of the EE. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity and azimuth. In the (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5\u00d75 ECAL crystal arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from the nominal interaction point. For |\u03b7| > 1.74, the coverage of the towers increases progressively to a maximum of 0.174 in \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap calorimeters. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke.

The s-channel process of single top quark production is generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo. Differential measurements of top quark pair production show that the measured p T spectrum of top quarks is softer than the one produced in simulation. Scale factors to correct for this effect are JHEP10 (2017)180derived from previous CMS measurements [26,27]. The sum of top quark pair events and single top quark events is referred to as \"Top quark background\" in the rest of the paper. The W and Z boson production in association with jets is simulated at LO with MadGraph5 amc@nlo. Up to four additional partons in the matrix element calculations are included. The MLM matching scheme [28] is used as an interface to the parton shower generated with pythia. The cross sections for W+jets and Z+jets processes are normalized to the next-to-next-to-leading order cross section, computed using fewz v3.1 [29]. Moreover, to improve the description of the distribution of high p T W+jets and Z+jets processes, events are reweighted using the generated p T of the vector boson to account for NLO quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and electroweak (EW) contributions [30][31][32].

In order to improve the discrimination of signal against multijet background, the pruning algorithm described in refs. [46,47], which is designed to remove contributions from soft radiation and pileup, is applied to AK8 jets. The pruned jet mass (m pruned corrected ) is defined as the invariant mass associated with the four-momentum of the pruned jet, after the application of the jet energy corrections [48]. Corrections to jet momenta are further propagated to the p miss T calculation [49]. In addition, tracks with p T > 1 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and with longitudinal impact parameter |d Z | < 0.1 cm from the primary vertex are used to reconstruct the track-based missing transverse momentum vector, p miss T,trk . The jets originating from the decay of b quarks are identified using the combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm [50,51], which uses PF jets as inputs. The algorithm combines the information from the primary vertex, track impact parameters, and secondary vertices within the jet using a neural network discriminator. The loose (medium) working point (WP) used in this analysis has a b jet selection efficiency of 83% (69%), a charm jet selection efficiency of 28% (20%), and a mistag rate for light-flavor jets of \u224810% (1%) [50]. The AK8 jets are split into two subjets using the soft-drop algorithm [52,53]. The CSV algorithm is tested and validated for AK4 and AK8 jets [50]. The working points for the analyses of the resolved and boosted regimes were chosen by maximizing the expected significance. The loose WP of the subjet b tagging algorithm is used for the boosted regime, whereas the medium WP of the AK4 jet b tagging algorithm is used for the resolved regime, since the background is higher in this case.",

An additional trigger with a p miss T > 170 GeV requirement is used to achieve higher efficiency. In this way, events with either high p miss T or high H miss T will pass the trigger. For events passing the selection criteria that have p miss T > 170(200) GeV for the resolved (boosted) analysis, the trigger efficiency is found to be greater than 98%. The p miss T threshold for the analysis of the resolved regime is set slightly lower to enhance the signal efficiency in this region of phase space, where the p miss T distribution is softer. Event filters are used to remove spurious high p miss T events caused by instrumental noise in the calorimeters, or beam halo muons. It has been verified that the efficiency of these filters for accepting signal events is very close to 100%. The main part of the event selection consists of Higgs boson tagging. This selection is different for the resolved and boosted analyses. In the resolved regime, events are required to have two AK4 jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. These two jets are used to reconstruct the Higgs boson candidate, which is required to have p T > 150 GeV. Each of the two AK4 jets in the resolved regime is required to pass the b tagging selection, whereas in the boosted regime, JHEP10 (2017)180the two subjets inside an AK8 jet must both pass the b tagging selection. In the boosted regime, the decay products from the Higgs boson are merged. Therefore, an AK8 jet with p T greater than 200 GeV is used to reconstruct the Higgs boson. If more than one Higgs boson candidate is reconstructed, the ambiguity is resolved by selecting the candidate with the highest p T . Backgrounds due to hadronic jets are further reduced by constraining the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate mass, m bb , to be between 100 and 150 GeV. For the resolved regime, the Higgs boson candidate mass is reconstructed using two b-tagged AK4 jets. For the boosted regime, the corrected pruned mass of the AK8 jet with two b-tagged subjets is used as the Higgs boson candidate mass.",

Data-to-simulation ratios for pre-fit and post-fit background predictions are shown in the lower panels of all figures 3-6. Figure 4 shows the comparison of data and simulation for the main observable, p miss T , in the W+jets, top quark, and Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets CRs for the resolved regime. The comparison between data and simulated samples for the boosted regime is shown in figure 5 for the single-lepton CR and the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) mass sideband region. Figure 6 shows the p miss T distributions in three bins in the SR that are used for the final signal extraction. These three bins were chosen to optimize the expected limits. The selected signal and background events are compared to data and fit simultaneously in the SR and CRs in three p miss T bins, separately for the resolved and the boosted regimes. The simultaneous fit of SR and background-enhanced CRs is performed correlating the scale factors and systematic uncertainties as described in section 6. The measured datato-simulation post-fit scale factors are compatible with unity within the total combined statistical and systematic uncertainty. In particular, for the resolved regime, the scale factors for the backgrounds are 1.23 \u00b1 0.17 for Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets, 1.33 \u00b1 0.19 for W+jets, and 1.13 \u00b1 0.17 for the top quark contributions. For the boosted analysis, the scale factors -10 -JHEP10 2017   are 0.77 \u00b1 0.15 for Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets and 0.95 \u00b1 0.19 for W+jets and top quark processes. Although the background scale factors do not show a common trend between the boosted and resolved analyses, it should be noted that the b-tagging requirement, selected phase space and other parameters are different in the two cases. Thus the two simultaneous fits are essentially independent, allowing the post-fit scale factors to move in either direction from unity.     Figure 6.

An average systematic uncertainty of 6% per b jet, 12% per c jet, and 15% per light quark or gluon jet is used to account for the normalization uncertainty [50]. The pruned mass distribution of the AK8 jet is not perfectly reproduced by simulation. Therefore, a control region, with a large number of events enriched in boosted hadronically decaying W bosons reconstructed as AK8 jets, is used to measure the systematic uncertainty due to this effect, giving an estimated value of 5%. Moreover, different hadronization algorithms (pythia and herwig++) give slightly different shapes for the pruned mass distribution. Therefore, an additional uncertainty of 10% is assigned to account for the difference between simulations. For the boosted regime, the same background normalization scale factor is used for W+jets and top quark backgrounds. The uncertainty in the relative normalization of these two processes is 30%. An uncertainty of 2% is measured by varying the lepton efficiency scale factors within one standard deviation and recomputing the signal selection efficiency. For W+jets, Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets and top quark backgrounds, variations in the renormalization and factorization scales directly affect the normalization and shape of the p miss T distribution. A variation of approximately 5% is found for the yields of these backgrounds in the signal region. The uncertainty in the signal acceptance and p miss T shape due to the choice of PDFs is measured following the method described by the PDF4LHC group [66]. A variation of approximately 3% is found in the signal yields. The effect of electroweak corrections as described in section 3 is studied by recomputing the normalization and shapes for the W+jets and Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets backgrounds, by alternately removing the corrections or doubling them. An uncertainty of 20% is assumed for the single top quark , SM Higgs boson, and diboson production rates. Uncertainties due to the finite size of the signal and background simulated samples are included in the normalization and shape, such that each bin of the final fitted distributions is affected independently.",

As shown in figure 9, for the phase space parameters considered for this model (g \u03c7 and tan \u03b2 equal to unity), results of the combined analysis are mainly driven by the h \u2192 bb channel. The combination with the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel provides a 2-4% improvement in terms of constraints on the model for the low Z mass values.
