For most of these excited c states the spin and parity (J P ) have not been determined by experiments due to limited statistics.",

The strong decays of excited c baryons have also been studied in many models [20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. In these models, some possible J P assignments of these excited c have been performed. While many new excited charmed baryons have been discovered in experiments in recent years, and there has been dedicated theoretical work devoted to study the nature of charmed baryon such as the baryon internal structure and quark configuration, further cooperative efforts are needed from both experimentalists and theorists to make progress in this area.",

According to the signal MC simulation, the mass resolution of c candidates is almost independent of the c decay mode. The c signal region is defined as |M c \u2212 m c | < 12 MeV/c 2 (\u223c 2.5\u03c3 ) for all c decay modes illustrated by the central green box in theFig. 1 (right panel), where m c is the nominal mass of the c baryon[1]. To estimate the nonc backgrounds, we define the + c and \u2212 c mass sidebands as half of the total number of events in the four sideband regions next to the signal region minus one quarter of the total number of events in the four sideband regions in the corners as shown inFig. 1 (right panel).To extract theB 0 \u2192 K 0 S + c\u00af \u2212 c signal yields, we perform an unbinned two-dimensional (2D) simultaneous extended maximum likelihood fit to the M B versus M bc distributions for the three reconstructed c decay modes. A Gaussian function for the signal shape plus an ARGUS function[48]   for the background are used to fit the M bc distribution, and the sum of a double-Gaussian function for the signal plus a )",
