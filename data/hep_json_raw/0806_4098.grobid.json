We take these to be M (\u03c0 + \u03c7 c1 ), M (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ), the \u03c7 c1 and J/\u03c8 helicity angles (\u03b8 \u03c7c1 and \u03b8 J/\u03c8 ), and the angle between the \u03c7 c1 (J/\u03c8) production and decay planes \u03c6 \u03c7c1 (\u03c6 J/\u03c8 ). Here we analyze theB 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c7 c1 decay process after integrating over the angular variables \u03b8 \u03c7c1 , \u03b8 J/\u03c8 , \u03c6 \u03c7c1 and \u03c6 J/\u03c8 . We find that the reconstruction efficiency is almost uniform over the full \u03c6 \u03c7c1 and \u03c6 J/\u03c8 angular ranges; therefore, after integrating over these angles the interference terms between different \u03c7 c1 helicity states, which contain factors of sin \u03c6 \u03c7c1 , cos \u03c6 \u03c7c1 , sin 2\u03c6 \u03c7c1 or cos 2\u03c6 \u03c7c1 , are negligibly small. We subsequently verify that the \u03b8 \u03c7c1 and \u03b8 J/\u03c8 distributions agree with these expectations. We perform a binned likelihood fit to the Dalitz plot distribution, where the bin size is chosen by decreasing its area until the fit results are unaffected by further changes. The selected number of bins is 400 \u00d7 400. We consider only those bins that are fully contained within the Dalitz plot boundaries; this corresponds to 99.3% of the total Dalitz plot area.",

Projections of the fit results for the seven slices are shown in Fig. 7, where the influence of the structure in the \u03c0 + \u03c7 c1 channel is most clearly seen in the second vertical slice. The mass and width of the Z + found from the fit are M = (4150 +31 \u221216 ) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (352 +99 \u221243 ) MeV; the fit fraction of Z + events, defined as the integral of the Z + contribution over the Dalitz plot divided by the integral of the signal function, The fit fraction is not determined directly from the fit and its statistical uncertainty is difficult to estimate based on the statistical uncertainties of fit parameters. In this paper the statistical uncertainties of fit fractions are determined using 1000 toy Monte Carlo samples. Each sample is generated according to the probability distri- bution determined from the fit to experimental data, and contains the same number of events as the data. We generate 1000 such samples, fit them, and determine the fit fractions. We fit the distribution of the obtained fit fractions to an asymmetric Gaussian function and consider the sigmas of the Gaussian function as the statistical un-certainty in the fit fraction. The significance of the Z + , calculated from the difference in log likelihood between fits with and without the Z + contribution with the change in the number of degrees of freedom taken into account, is 10.7 \u03c3. The results of the fit with the Z + contribution excluded from the default fit function are presented in Fig. 8. The fit fractions and significances for each of the resonances included in the default model are listed in Table I.

This amplitude can be related to a decay that proceeds via a virtual B * . Rows 8 through 10 show results from fits that include the non-resonant contribution, but without the K * (1410), K * (1680) or K * 3 (1780), respectively. Row 11 corresponds to a fit that includes the non-resonant term and releases the experimental constraints on the mass and width of the \u03ba. We also consider models that include the nonresonant contribution, plus an additional J = 1 (row 12) or J = 2 (row 13) K * resonance with floating mass and width.

For the \u03c7 c1 in the helicity zero state the expected angular distribution for \u03c7 c1 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decay is P 0 = 9 32 (1 + 2 cos 2 \u03b8 \u03c7c1 cos 2 \u03b8 J/\u03c8 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 J/\u03c8 ), while for the \u03c7 c1 in the helicity \u00b11 state the expected angular distribution is P 1 = 9 32 (1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 \u03c7c1 cos 2 \u03b8 J/\u03c8 ). Here it is assumed that different J/\u03c8 helicity states do not interfere. We integrate the helicity zero and helicity \u00b11 components of the fit function over the Dalitz plot and find the relative contributions w 0 and w \u00b11 . The expected angular distribution is then P = w 0 P 0 + w \u00b11 P \u00b11 .",

The agreement with predictions is good. It is evident that the different models give very similar predictions and these angular distributions are not useful for discriminating between them. The invariant mass distribution M (\u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + ) for the Dalitz plot slice 1.0 GeV 2 /c 4 < M 2 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) < 1.75 GeV 2 /c 4 , where the contribution of the structure in the \u03c0 + \u03c7 c1 channel is most clearly seen, is shown in Fig. 14. Recently Belle observed the first candidate for a charmonium-like state with non-zero electric charge, the Z(4430) + [1]. The two resonance-like structures reported here represent additional candidate states of similar character. The existence of new resonances decaying into \u03c7 cJ \u03c0 is expected within the framework of the hadrocharmonium model [14].",
