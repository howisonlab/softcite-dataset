The event selection applies a veto on the presence of isolated electrons or muons and additional requirements on the number of b-tagged jets and the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets. Having explored the full ATLAS 2015-2016 dataset of LHC proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, which corresponds to 36.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, no evidence is found for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models inspired by R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating supersymmetry, where gluinos are pair-produced. More generic models within the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric Standard Model are also considered.",

One distinctive signature of such processes would be an increased incidence of events containing a large number of jets accompanied by missing transverse momentum (the magnitude of which is denoted E miss T ). These could originate from extended cascade decays of heavy particles through lighter states, which might interact weakly and therefore have remained unobserved due to their low production cross-sections.",

            "text": "A particle spectrum of this nature is exemplified by the pair production of heavy gluinos (g) that decay via long cascade chains, such as through the superpartners of the electroweak and Higgs bosons. In R-parity-conserving (RPC) [8] SUSY models, these decays culminate in the production of a stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Cosmological and other observations prohibit an electrically charged or strongly interacting LSP [9][10][11][12], hence the production of these objects, invisible to the detector, would result in missing transverse momentum. Similarly, large jet multiplicities could also be achieved if the gluinos were to decay via on-or off-shell top squarks (t 1 ) or via R-parity-violating (RPV) [13] couplings. In the latter case, the LSP could decay within the detector volume, softening the E miss T spectrum. This paper reports the results of an analysis of 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collision data recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment [14] in 2015 and 2016, scrutinising events that contain significant E miss T and at least seven jets with a large transverse momentum (p T ). Selected events are further classified based on the presence of jets containing B-hadrons (b-jets) or on the sum of the masses of large-radius jets. The b-jet selection improves the sensitivity to beyond-the-SM (BSM) signals with enhanced heavyflavour decays. Given the unusually high jet multiplicities of the target signatures, large jet masses can originate both from capturing the decay products from boosted heavy particles including top quarks and from accidental combinations [15]. A key feature of the search is the data-driven method used to estimate the dominant background from multijet production. Other major background processes include top quark pair production (tt) and W boson production in conjunction with jets (W +jets).",

This exploits the long lifetime, high decay multiplicity, hard fragmentation and large mass of B-hadrons. The selected working point for the b-tagging algorithm [94] tags b-jets in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 with an efficiency of approximately 70% in simulated tt events, and rejects c-jets, \u03c4 -jets and light-quark or gluon jets by factors of 9.6, 31 and 254, respectively. For the purposes of overlap removal, a loose b-tag designation is JHEP12(2017)034 defined using a working point with 80% b-tagging efficiency. Where b-tagging selections are applied, efficiency corrections measured in data are applied to simulated events, to improve modelling of the b-tagging efficiencies.",

For \u00b5 tt and \u00b5 W , the corresponding leptonic control regions provide the constraints. The 6-jet (j50) or 5-jet (j80) template region is treated as another control region in the fit such that \u00b5 multijet is coupled to any modifications of \u00b5 tt and \u00b5 W . If \u00b5 tt = \u00b5 W = 1, then \u00b5 multijet = 1 by construction, as the same region is used to derive the nominal multijet estimate. The systematic uncertainties (see section 7.1) are implemented in the form of Gaussian-constrained nuisance parameters modifying the Poisson mean of each background component contributing to the estimate in a given signal or control region. Minimisation of the likelihood (profiling) fixes the values of, and uncertainties in, \u00b5 b , which can then be combined with the MC and template predictions to obtain the total background prediction in the signal region. The compatibility of the background prediction and SR observation is computed in the form of a p-value CL b which is the probability of an upwards fluctuation from the SR prediction no larger than that observed in data, given the background model.",
