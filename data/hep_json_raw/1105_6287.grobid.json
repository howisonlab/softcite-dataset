A matrix-element method is developed that combines an in situ jet energy calibration with our standard jet energy scale derived from studies of \u03b3+jet and dijet events. We then implement a flavor-dependent jet response correction through a novel approach. This method is used to measure a top-quark mass of mt = 176.01 \u00b1 1.64 GeV. Combining this result with our previous result obtained on an independent data set, we measure a top-quark mass of mt = 174.94 \u00b1 1.49 GeV for a total integrated luminosity of 3.6 fb \u22121 .",

The observation of the top quark in 1995 [1,2] confirmed the existence of the six quarks in three generations of fermions expected in the standard model (SM) of particle interactions. Because of its mass, the lifetime of the top quark is much shorter than the time-scale of hadronization. The top quark can therefore decay before interacting, making it the only quark whose characteristics can be studied in isolation. The large mass of the top quark (m t ), corresponding to a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson equal to 1 within the current uncertainties, suggests a special role for the top quark in the breaking of electroweak symmetry. It is therefore not surprising that the precise determination of the mass of the top quark has received great attention. The interest in the top-quark mass also arises from the constraint imposed on the mass of the Higgs boson, m H , from the relationship among the values of m t , m H , and the SM radiative corrections to the mass of the W boson [3]. A precise measurement of m t also provides a useful constraint on contributions from physics beyond the standard model [4].",

The analysis focuses on tt events identified in lepton+jets (\u2113+jets) final states (with \u2113 representing either an electron or a muon) [6], in which the top and antitop quark are assumed to decay into a W boson and b quark [7], with one of the W bosons in the W + W \u2212 bb final system decaying via W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd into a lepton and neutrino and the other via W \u2192 qq \u2032 into two quarks, and all four quarks (qq \u2032 bb) hadronizing into jets. Such events are characterized by an isolated electron or muon with large transverse momentum (p T ), an undetected neutrino that causes a large imbalance in transverse momentum, and four highp T jets. In selecting candidate events, we exploit this distinct signature, which helps distinguish these events from background.",

The analysis uses the same matrix element (ME) analysis technique, with an in situ jet energy calibration based on constraining the invariant mass of the two jets from the decay of the W boson to the world average value of M W = 80.4 GeV [9]. As in the previous measurement, the standard jet energy scale (JES), derived from \u03b3+jet and dijet data samples, is used as an additional constraint, and implemented through a Gaussian prior on its absolute value and uncertainty. A major improvement in this new measurement is the significant reduction of the uncertainty associated with the modeling of differences in the calorimeter response to b-quark and light-quark jets originating from the introduction of a new flavor-dependent jet energy response correction.",

It is therefore important to understand the precise definition of the input mass m gen t in MC tt event generators, such as alpgen [10] and pythia [11], used to calibrate the direct measurements. Although m gen t is not well defined in leading order (LO) generators that use parton showers to model higher-order effects and hadronization, it has been argued that m gen t should be viewed as being close to the pole mass [12]. In Ref. [13], the D0 Collaboration has extracted m t from a comparison of the measured tt production cross section with predictions from higher-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD), by equating m gen is found to be different from the average value of m t . These results favor the pole mass interpretation of m gen t . This paper is arranged as follows. A brief description of the D0 detector is given in Sec. II, which is followed by a discussion of the selection and reconstruction of the physical objects in this analysis in Sec. III. Section IV summarizes the MC samples used to simulate the events of interest, and Sec. V discusses the technique used to extract the value of m t . This is followed by a description of the calibration of the response of the analysis method in Sec. VI and a discussion of the flavor-dependent jet response correction used to bring the simulation of the calorimeter response to jets into agreement with data in Sec. VII. The result of the calibration is applied to the data in Sec. VIII, where the measured value of m t and its statistical uncertainty are also presented. Section IX describes the evaluation of systematic uncertainties and the final result is given in Sec. X. We combine this new measurement in Sec. XI with an updated version of that from Ref. [8] in which the flavor-dependent jet response correction mentioned above has been applied and the systematic uncertainties have been updated.",

We identify the b jets among the candidates satisfying the jet selection criteria described in the previous section by using a neural network (NN) b-tagging algorithm that selects jets with displaced vertices and tracks relative to the PV [23]. The NN tagger is based on nine input variables that can be separated into two categories. The first category is related to the reconstructed secondary vertex and includes the vertex quality, the number of associated tracks, the invariant mass of the vertex, the number of secondary vertices reconstructed within the jet, the spatial separation between the jet axis and the position vector of the secondary vertex relative to the PV, and the length of the flight path projected on the transverse plane divided by its uncertainty (which provides a measure of the decay length significance in terms of standard deviations). The second category relies only on the characteristics of the tracks within the jets such as impact parameters, transverse momentum, and track quality. The b-jet candidates are also required to have at least two good quality tracks originating from the PV. The tagging efficiency for b jets is \u2248 65% for a misidentification rate of \u2248 3% for u, d, s quark, or gluon jets [24].",

The selected events must satisfy a single-lepton trigger, requiring a high p T electron or muon, or a lepton+jets trigger, requiring a lower-p T electron or muon accompanied by a jet. Events are required to have at least one PV with > 2 tracks reconstructed within the fiducial region of the SMT. We require exactly four jets with |\u03b7| < 2.5, with the leading (highest p T ) jet having p T > 40 GeV, and the other jets p T > 20 GeV. Leptons are required to originate from within 1 cm of the PV in the coordinate along the beam line. Exactly one tight electron (or tightly isolated muon) with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.1 (|\u03b7| < 2) is also required. Electron+jets events containing a second tight electron with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 or a veto muon with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2 are rejected. Muon+jets events containing a second muon that is a veto muon with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2 or a tight electron with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 are rejected. The missing transverse momentum is required to satisfy p / T > 20 GeV (p / T > 25 GeV) for e+jets (\u00b5+jets) events. Multijet background, typically arising from mismeasurement of lepton or jet energies, is suppressed by requiring a minimal azimuthal separation between the lepton direction and the p / T vector with \u2206\u03c6(e, p / T ) > 0.7\u03c0 \u2212 0.045 \u2022 p / T for electrons and",

VI) are generated using alpgen [10] to simulate the hard-scattering process and pythia [11] to simulate hadronization and shower evo-lution. The MLM matching scheme [25] is employed to avoid overlaps between components of the event belonging to the hard process, implemented through a matrix element, and parton evolution (showering) into jets. The W +jets background samples are divided into two categories: (i) W + lp and (ii) W + (cc, lp) and W + (bb, lp), where lp (light partons) denotes u, d, s-quarks, or gluons. Although the individual processes are produced with alpgen which is a LO generator, the relative contributions between the two categories are determined using next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations, with nextto-leading logarithmic (NLL) corrections based on the mcfm MC generator [26]. The MC samples used to derive jet transfer functions that correlate jet energies with those of partons in the tt events (described in Sec. V B 1) are generated using pythia to simulate both the hardscattering process and the subsequent hadronization and shower evolution for the events. All MC samples are generated with CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [27], and passed through a full geant3-based [28] simulation of the D0 detector. To simulate the effects from additional pp interactions, events with no trigger requirements selected from random pp crossings in the collider data having the same instantaneous luminosity profile as the data are overlayed on the fully simulated MC events. This is then followed by the same reconstruction and analysis chain as applied to data.",

Multijet events satisfy this condition and can therefore be represented by P bkg , as the event kinematics are far closer to W +jets than to tt production. Due to the finite detector resolution and the hadronization process, the measured set x for the observed events will not, in general, be identical to the corresponding set y of the original final-state partons and the relationship between x and y is described by a transfer function. In addition, the initial partons carry momenta q 1 and q 2 in the colliding p and p. To account for this complication, P sig and P bkg must be integrated over all parton states contributing to the observed set x.

Detector resolution is taken into account in W (x, y; k JES ), representing the probability density for the measured set x to have arisen from the partonic set y. Dividing by the total observed cross section for the process, \u03c3(\u03b1), ensures P (x; \u03b1) is normalized to unity. The differential cross section term for P sig is calculated using the LO ME of the quark-antiquark annihilation process (M tt ). A total of 24 integration variables are associated with the two initial state partons and the six particles in the final state. Since the angles for the four jets and the charged lepton are sufficiently well measured, the angular resolution terms in W (x, y; k JES ) can be approximated by Dirac \u03b4-functions. Integrating over these and four more \u03b4-functions that impose energymomentum conservation leaves 10 integrals to evaluate the probability density that represents the tt production probability for a given m t and k JES [30]: where, in addition to the CTEQ6L1 PDF given by f (q i ), the f \u2032 (q i ) also include parameterizations of the probability distributions for the transverse momenta q x,y i of the initial-state partons in pythia [11]. The masses of the initial-state partons are given by m qi , and \u03a6 6 includes the 6-body phase-space factor and other constants. The first sum is over all 24 jet permutations, each carrying a weight w i , which is the product of four jet weights. The weight for a b-tagged jet with a given p T and \u03b7 is the average tagging efficiency \u01eb \u03b1 (p T , \u03b7) for a given parton hypothesis \u03b1 (= b, c, light q, or gluon). The weight for a jet that is not b-tagged is 1 \u2212 \u01eb \u03b1 (p T , \u03b7). The second sum includes up to eight solutions for neutrino kinematics, and conservation of transverse momentum used to calculate the transverse momentum of the neutrino. The parameter \u03c1 represents the fraction of the energy carried by one of the quarks from the W \u2192 qq \u2032 decay. The masses of the two W bosons (M 1 ,M 2 ) and of the pair of top quarks (m 1 , m 2 ) are chosen as integration variables because of computational efficiency related to the four Breit-Wigner mass terms that make the ME negligible everywhere except at the mass peaks. The energy (the curvature 1/p T ) of the electron (muon) is defined by \u03c1 \u2113 . The integration over q i involves only transverse components. W (x, y; k JES ) is the product of five terms for the four jets and one charged lepton, described below. The normalization \u03c3 tt obs = A(x)P sig dx = \u03c3 tt (m t ) \u00d7 A(m t , k JES ) is calculated from the product of the total cross section corresponding to the ME used and the mean acceptance for events whose dependencies on m t and k JES are determined from MC events. The mean acceptance is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of m t for different values of k JES .",

Uncertainties in this assumption are discussed in the section on systematic uncertainties (Sec. IX). The in situ jet energy scale employed in this analysis can account for a global scale discrepancy between data and MC jet energy scales (see Sec. IX B 1) by rescaling the energies of the two light jets from the W \u2192 qq \u2032 decay of tt events to the world average mass of the W boson [9]. This same rescaling is also applied to the two b jets in the event. However, jets originating from different partons have different kinematic characteristics and particle compositions. In particular, b and light jets with different electromagnetic fractions can lead to different responses in a non-compensating calorimeter. Such features, if not properly simulated, can result in a systematic shift in the determination of the top-quark mass. In fact, the largest contribution to the total systematic uncertainty of our previous analysis in Ref. [8] is the b/light-quark response ratio which was an estimate of the effect of such a discrepancy.",

Defining the correction this way preserves the standard MC jet energy scale that is, strictly speaking, only appropriate for the \u03b3+jet events from which it is derived. At the same time, it brings the relative response difference between jets of flavor \u03b2 and jets in \u03b3+jet events in MC into agreement with that in data. The quantity F \u03b2 corr \u2212 1 is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of jet p T and \u03b7 for light-quark, gluon, and b jets. The shaded band at F \u03b2 corr \u2212 1 = 0 in each plot corresponds to the correction for jets in \u03b3+jet events.

All of the uncertainties in this table are unchanged, except for the uncertainties in the modeling of signal and the relative b/light-quark response ratio. The uncertainty for the modeling of signal in the previous analysis is replaced with one from the current analysis, which includes contributions from uncertainties in the modeling of higher-order effects, ISR/FSR, hadronization and underlying event, color reconnection, and multiple hadron interactions. The uncertainty on b/light-quark response is replaced with that associated with differences in jet response in data and MC for the current analysis (see also Sec. VII). The uncertainty in the modeling of background in Table I of Ref. [8] is the sum in quadrature of (i) the uncertainty in the heavy-flavor scale factor, and (ii) the uncertainty associated with discrepancies between data and MC background distributions. Since the uncertainty on the renormalization and factorization scale was not evaluated in the previous analysis, we include the additional contribution described in the second part of Sec. IX A 7. We also evaluate the uncertainty associated with the flavor-dependent jet-response correction factors appropriate for the previous analysis, using the procedure described in Sec. IX B 2. We find the mean of the extracted m t shifts by 0.13 GeV (\u22120.22 GeV) relative to the sample corrected with the central values when we change the correction factors by 1 sd (\u22121 sd).
