This is the first observation of this decay channel, with a statistical significance of 15 standard deviations. The mass of the B 0 s meson is measured to be 5367.08 \u00b1 0.38 \u00b1 0.15 MeV/c 2 . The branching fraction ratio B(B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6\u03c6)/B(B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6) is measured to be 0.0115 \u00b1 0.0012 +0.0005   \u22120.0009 . In both cases, the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. No evidence for non-resonant B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + K \u2212 or B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 decays is found.",

The most recent theoretical predictions for heavy hadron masses, based on lattice QCD calculations, can be found in refs. [4][5][6]. The current experimental knowledge of the B 0 s mass, as summarized in ref. [7], is dominated by results from the LHCb experiment [8], which were obtained with the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decay using a small fraction of the integrated luminosity collected in the 2010-2012 LHC run. The B 0 s mass measurement using this decay is limited by the precision of the momentum scale. The B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u03c6 decay mode is a good alternative to B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 since the kinetic energy available to the final-state particles (Q-value) is much lower, leading to a 65% reduction in the systematic uncertainty arising from the precision of the momentum scale.",

In recent years, many new charmonium or charmonium-like states have been discovered, which are not easily accommodated in the quark model of hadrons [9,10]. In a study of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 K + decays, the CDF collaboration reported evidence for a state, in the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 invariant mass spectrum, called Y (4140) with mass and width values of m = 4143.0 \u00b1 2.9 (stat) \u00b1 1.2 (syst) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 11.7 +8.3 \u22125.0 (stat) \u00b1 3.7 (syst) MeV [3]. The Belle and BaBar collaborations searched for the Y (4140) using the same B + decay mode [1,11] and found no significant signal, although the upper limits on the production rate did not contradict the CDF measurement. Recently, the D0 collaboration reported a similar structure [12]. At the LHC, both the LHCb and CMS collaborations have searched",

The search for resonances in the \u03c6 \u03c6 invariant mass spectrum is also of interest. Several experiments have reported a near-threshold enhancement in the \u03c6 \u03c6 invariant mass distribution from the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03c6 \u03c6 decay [14][15][16].

The B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u03c6 decay is the B 0 s counterpart of the measured B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 K 0 decays [17]. All these channels are strongly suppressed with respect to the similar decays without the additional \u03c6 meson in the final state. The suppression factors of the last two channels are 0.048 \u00b1 0.004 and 0.057 \u00b1 0.012 for the charged and neutral decays [7]. A qualitative comparison with these branching fractions can be done considering that the phase space of the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u03c6 is smaller by a factor of seven, so the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u03c6 branching fraction is expected to be \u223c 10 \u22125 . This paper presents the first observation of the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u03c6 and the decay branching fraction measurement with respect to the reference decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6. A measurement of the B 0 s mass is also presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 pp collisions collected by the LHCb experiment. The data were recorded in the years 2011 and 2012 at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively.",

For the B 0 s mass determination, the momentum scale calibration is the main source of systematic uncertainty. The momentum scale takes into account the limited knowledge of the detector alignment. By comparing measured mass values for several charmed mesons with precisely known values, an uncertainty of 0.03% on the momentum scale is estimated [39]. The corresponding uncertainty in the B 0 s mass value is \u00b10.12 MeV/c 2 . The uncertainty in the kaon mass [7] will affect the B 0 s mass determination, while the uncertainty on the J/\u03c8 mass has a negligible effect. The effect is estimated by repeating the fit with the kaon mass shifted by \u00b1\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the uncertainty on the known kaon mass.

In the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 plot, for each candidate two values are calculated, one for each \u03c6 meson. The distribution of data and simulation (phase space) are shown. To compare the shape, the two distributions are normalised to the same area.",
