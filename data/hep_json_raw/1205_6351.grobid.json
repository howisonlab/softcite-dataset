The spin-singlet (S = 0) states of the quark pair with zero orbital momentum, L = 0, are customarily called \u03b7 b (nS) with n = 1, 2, . . .. The hyperfine splitting \u2206M HF from the corresponding spin-triplet state, i.e. the mass difference between the \u03a5(nS) and \u03b7 b (nS), provides an important measure of the spin-spin interaction between the quark and the antiquark. The existing measurements [2] of the \u03b7 b (1S) mass are only in marginal agreement with theoretical expectations [3,4] ",

We use events that pass the Belle-standard hadronic event selection and consider all positively identified \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs that originate from the vicinity of the interaction point. Belle previously observed that the decay \u03a5(5S) \u2192 h b (nP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 proceeds via the intermediate resonances Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) [8].

To suppress continuum e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) background, we use the ratio R 2 of the second-to zeroth-order Fox-Wolfram moments [9]. In the \u03b7 b (1S) analysis, we require R 2 < 0.3, which was optimized using the \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [7]. For the high statistics h b (1P ) \u2192 \u03b7 b (1S)\u03b3 transition, the optimum is shifted to R 2 < 0.32, which we adopt here for the \u03b7 b (2S) analysis.",

We also multiply the non-relativistic Breit-Wigner function by an E 3 \u03b3 term expected for an electric dipole transition and include the uncertainty in the h b (1P ) and h b (2P ) masses and in the estimated value of the \u03b7 b (2S) width. The contribution of each source is given in Table III. We add the various contributions in quadrature to estimate the total systematic uncertainty. We repeat the analysis using signal MC instead of data and find no shift of the \u03b7 b (nS) parameters compared to the MC input. For the hyperfine splittings m \u03a5(nS) \u2212 m \u03b7 b (nS) we determine \u2206M HF (1S) = (57.9 \u00b1 2.3) MeV/c 2 and \u2206M HF (2S) = (24.3 +4.0 \u22124.5 ) MeV/c 2 , where statistical and systematic uncertainties in mass are added in quadrature.

For the significance of the \u03b7 b (2S) signal, we use a method that takes into account the trial factor associated with the definition of the search window or the so-called \"look-elsewhere effect\" [16]. To determine this window, we conservatively assume r = 0 and r = 1 for the ratio r = \u2206MHF(2S) \u2206MHF(1S) . (For reference, the measured value of r = 0.420 +0.071 \u22120.079 is consistent with perturbative calculations [14] that predict and \u03c0 0 veto requirements [by the R 2 requirement], \u01eb is the reconstruction efficiency of the photon. In this way, we do not rely on MC simulation for the determination of the efficiency of the R 2 and \u03c0 0 veto requirements.

For N total , we add the N and N anti\u2212cut uncertainties in quadrature. The contributions from the various sources of systematic uncertainty to the N total nP \u2192mS are given in Table IV. The h b (nP ) signal shape uncertainty is not considered for the yields, since it cancels in the ratio N total nP \u2192mS /N total nP . In combining the N nP \u2192mS and N anti\u2212cut nP \u2192mS uncertainties, we take into account correlations of the calibration and \u03b7 b (nS) line shape sources. We find N total 1P \u21921S = (30.9 \u00b1 3.
