            "text": "Studies of low energy e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons are of great interest for theory and have numerous applications. According to current concepts, e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons proceeds via an intermediate virtual photon which produces a pair of quarks, qq, followed by the hadronization of quarks into observed hadrons. This process is described by the lowest-order Feynman diagram shown in Fig. 1. When the initial energy of e + e \u2212 , or equivalently of the intermediate virtual photon, is large enough, the process of hadronization is well described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). At small energies, lower than 2-3 GeV, produced hadrons are relatively soft and intensively interact with each other forming hadronic resonances. At the moment QCD fails to describe this energy region. Because of that, it is vitally important to gain sufficient information from experiment to be used as an input to various QCD-based theoretical models. QCD sum rules are an example of how measurements of total and exclusive cross sections can be used to extract such fundamental parameters of theory as the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s , quark and gluon condensates (Shifman et al., 2000).",

It can be seen that the angular distribution of the ISR photon weakly depends on x and that a considerable fraction of the photons is emitted at large angles. In the next section we will discuss two approaches to study ISR events, a tagged and untagged one. In the tagged approach the ISR photon should be detected, i.e., emitted at a large angle, into the fiducial volume of the detector. At B-factories (2E 0 = 10.58 GeV) about 10% of highenergy ISR photons have 30 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 150 \u2022 . This angular range approximately corresponds to the fiducial volume of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the BABAR detector. The fraction of the large-angle ISR increases with decrease of the energy as shown in Fig. 4. The compact expressions for W 0 can be written for two practically applicable cases.

(Kuraev and Fadin, 1985) can be used, which takes into account soft multiphoton emission and \u03b1 2 terms in the leading logarithmic approximation. In this approximation the accuracy \u2206W/W is expected to be better than 1%. The relative difference between W (x) and W 0 (0, x) as a function of the invariant mass of the final hadronic system is shown in Fig. 5 for 2E 0 = 1.02 GeV, the c.m. energy of the \u03c6-factory in Frascati. It is seen that the radiative correction to the lowest-order radiator function reaches 15%. It should be noted that the size of the radiation correction depends on experimental conditions. For example, in Ref. (Aubert et al., 2006a) the function W (x) is calculated at 2E 0 = 10.58 GeV with conditions that the highest-energy ISR photon has a polar angle in the range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 160 \u2022 and that the invariant mass of the hadronic system combined with the ISR photon is greater than 8 GeV/c 2 . The latter condition restricts the maximum energy of extra photons emitted from the initial state. With these conditions the radiative correction factor 1 + \u03b4 = W (20 \u2022 , x)/W 0 (20 \u2022 , x) is close to unity with the maximum deviation \u03b4 of about 2%.",

Several theoretical papers are devoted to study radiative corrections to ISR processes, for example, (Arbuzov et al., 1998;Binner et al., 1999;Czy\u017c et al., 2003;Khoze et al., 2001Khoze et al., , 2002Rodrigo et al., 2002). The approaches of Refs. (Binner et al., 1999;Czy\u017c et al., 2003;Rodrigo et al., 2002) allow one to develop genera-tors of Monte Carlo (MC) events and are used in analyses of experimental data. In Ref. (Binner et al., 1999) the photon emission at large angles only is considered; radiative corrections are calculated in the leading logarithmic approximation with the structure function technique (Caffo et al., 1994(Caffo et al., , 1997. The accuracy of the method is determined by neglecting sub-leading \u03b1 2 contributions and estimated in Ref. (Rodrigo et al., 2001) to be about 1%. In Refs. (Czy\u017c et al., 2003;Rodrigo et al., 2002) the one-loop corrections and exact matrix element for emission of two hard photons are calculated. The accuracy of this next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation is estimated to be about 0.5% (Rodrigo et al., 2002) due to the higher-order effects.",

At these relatively low invariant masses, pions are produced in a narrow cone around the vector opposite to the ISR photon momentum and therefore can be detected only if the ISR photon is emitted at a large angle.

The hadronic cross sections in the mass region between the \u03c6-and J/\u03c8-meson resonances do not contain structures with a width comparable to the detector resolution. The 25-MeV/c 2 mass bin was chosen for a study of most of the processes with light hadrons. With such a bin size the distortion of the mass spectrum shape because of resolution effects is small. A smaller bin size was used for analyses of the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03b3 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3. For the former, it is important to study a near-threshold enhancement in the mass dependence of the proton electromagnetic form factor. The good pp mass resolution for masses below 2 GeV/c 2 (see Fig.9) allows to measure the cross section in this region with the 5 MeV/c 2 mass bin (Aubert et al., 2006a). The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section near the \u03c1-meson peak was measured in the BABAR experiment with the mass interval of 2 MeV/c 2 (Aubert et al., 2009a), which is significantly smaller than the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass resolution (about 6 MeV/c 2 at the \u03c1 peak). The unfolding of resolution effects from the high-statistics (about one-half million events) mass spectrum was performed with the procedure described in Ref. (Malaescu, 2009). The procedure uses a mass-transfer matrix that gives the probability that an event with true mass in an interval i is reconstructed with m meas in interval j. The transfer matrix is usually obtained using MC simulation and corrected to take into account a difference in the resolution between data and simulation. The measurement of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section at the \u03c6-factory (Ambrosino et al., 2009) with the KLOE detector was performed with the 0.01 GeV 2 step in the squared mass s \u2032 = m 2 2\u03c0 corresponding to a mass bin width of 6.5 MeV/c 2 near the \u03c1 peak. The mass reso-lution of the KLOE detector is about 1.3 MeV/c 2 at the \u03c1 mass. The resolution effects are substantial only in the mass region of the \u03c9-\u03c1 interference. For comparison with theory, these effects were removed by unfolding the mass spectrum using the Bayesian method (D'Agostini, 1995).",

The detection efficiency used was calculated in Sec. II.A for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 with a tagged ISR photon. The integrated luminosity is taken to be 500 fb \u22121 . The dashed curve in Fig. 10 shows the same quantity calculated for the KLOE experiment with the integrated luminosity of 240 pb \u22121 and detection efficiency taken for the case of an untagged ISR photon (Fig. 8). The luminosity of 240 pb \u22121 was used in the recent measurement (Ambrosino et al., 2009) of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section in the 0.592-0.975 GeV/c 2 mass range. The total integrated luminosity collected by the KLOE is about an order of magnitude larger, 2.5 fb \u22121 . The KLOE ISR luminosity is shown only up to 0.92 GeV/c 2 . It increases sharply and reaches 21 pb \u22121 at 0.975 GeV/c 2 . It should be noted that the BABAR measurement of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section (Aubert et al., 2009a) is also based on a part of the recorded data corresponding to 232 fb \u22121 . The histogram in Fig. 10 shows the distribution of the integrated luminosities collected in some direct e + e \u2212 experiments. At masses below 1.4 GeV/c 2 the statistics of the SND experiment (Achasov et al., 2002) recorded at the VEPP-2M collider is presented. This is the largest integrated luminosity collected in this mass region in a single experiment. The mass bin 1.0-1.1 GeV/c 2 does not include about 13 pb \u22121 taken by SND in vicinity of the \u03c6-meson resonance. The significant part of the statistics from the 0.7-0.8 GeV/c 2 mass interval is collected in the \u03c9-meson mass window 0.76-0.80 GeV/c 2 . In the c.m. energy range 1.4-2.2 GeV/c 2 the experiments with the largest statistics are DM1 and DM2 at the Orsay DCI e + e \u2212 collider. The histogram at m > 1.4 GeV/c 2 shows a sum of the integrated luminosities collected with these detectors. At low masses of the hadronic system the data samples of ISR events currently available at B-factories exceed the statistics collected in conventional e + e \u2212 experiments, especially at masses below 0.7 GeV/c 2 and above 1.4 GeV/c 2 . The ISR luminosity of the \u03c6-factory increases very rapidly with mass. For masses below 0.8 GeV/c 2 the luminosity currently used for ISR analysis (Ambrosino et al., 2009) is comparable with that collected in direct e + e \u2212 experiments. For higher masses it exceeds both BABAR and e + e \u2212 luminosities.",

The ISR luminosity in this mass region sig- nificantly exceeds the integrated luminosity collected in direct e + e \u2212 experiments including the recent CLEO-c energy scan (Cronin-Hennessy et al., 2009), 60 pb \u22121 at twelve points between 3.97 and 4.26 GeV. Thus, the current data samples of ISR events produced at the B-and \u03c6-factories are larger than those produced directly in e + e \u2212 collisions for all masses of interest excluding the regions near the narrow resonances (\u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S)). For masses above 1.4 GeV/c 2 this allows to significantly improve accuracy of the measurements of exclusive hadronic cross sections.

In many cases, particularly for final states with low invariant mass of the produced particles, the hadronic system is collimated along the direction opposite to the ISR photon.

In Fig.7 the angular dependence of the detection efficiency is shown for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03b3 (Aubert et al., 2006a). The angular dependence is close to uniform. This reduces the model dependence of the cross section measurement due to the unknown relation between the values of the proton electric and magnetic form factors, and significantly facilitates data analysis.

For many years only e + e \u2212 scan experiments provided information on this reaction and determined the uncertainty of the SM prediction of the muon anomaly (Davier et al., 2003a,b). Main information on light vector mesons has been also obtained in such measurements. Unfortunately, the collected data samples were not sufficient for a precise determination of parameters of excited vector mesons. Recently, due to a very high luminosity of the e + e \u2212 factories, DAFNE, KEK-B, and PEP-II, the ISR technique became a powerful tool for an independent study of e + e \u2212 annihilation at low energies.",

            "text": "For the first time it was demonstrated that the cross section determined by this method could have smaller statistical errors than direct e + e \u2212 measurements and could be compet-itive with them in a systematic uncertainty. Both untagged (Aloisio et al., 2005;Ambrosino et al., 2009) and tagged (Ambrosino et al., 2011;Muller, 2009) ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 events were studied with consistent results. While the tagged measurement has worse statistical errors and an additional source of the systematic uncertainty due to the FSR contribution, it covers the region of small invariant masses inaccessible for the untagged measurement. The result of the tagged measurement (Ambrosino et al., 2011;Muller, 2009) represented as a pion electromagnetic form factor squared is shown in Fig. 16(top) together with the results of the direct e + e \u2212 measurements with the CMD-2 (Akhmetshin et al., 2007) and SND (Achasov et al., 2006) detectors. Comparison of the more precise untagged KLOE measurement (Ambrosino et al., 2009) with the CMD-2 and SND data is given in Fig. 16(bottom). At invariant masses corresponding to the maximum of the \u03c1 resonance and its high-mass tail the points from direct e + e \u2212 measurements lie systematically higher than those from KLOE. In this mass region the difference between the CMD-2 and KLOE measurements is definitely larger than their combined systematic uncertainty. The KLOE systematic error includes the experimental (0.6%) and theoretical (0.6%) uncertainties. Two main sources of the former are tracking and luminosity measurement. The latter is determined mostly by the accuracy of the radiator function calculated with the PHOKHARA event generator. Note that the KLOE Collaboration performed a dedicated study to validate a calculation of FSR effects using forward-backward asymmetry arising from the interference between the ISR and FSR amplitudes (M\u00fcller, 2009). The study showed that the assumption of pointlike pions works reasonably well and can be used for the FSR calculation, see Fig. 17.",

The three-pion mass distribution for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 reaction shown in Fig. 22 is dominated by the well known \u03c9(782), \u03c6(1020), and J/\u03c8 resonances. For the \u03c9(782) and \u03c6(1020) resonances they determine the product of the leptonic width and the branching fraction to three pions consistent with other measurements and having comparable accuracy. Large data samples make possible the observation of two structures in the 1-2 GeV/c 2 mass region (see Fig. 23). The cross section below 1.4 GeV is in agreement with the SND measurement (Achasov et al., 2002), but at higher energies a large deviation from the DM2 results (Antonelli et al., 1992) is observed. The cross section in this region is fitted (see inset in 2008). The parameters of these states are still not well determined. In this case they strongly depend on relative phases between the corresponding amplitudes and their phase differences with the \u03c9(782) and \u03c6(1020) amplitudes. The latter resonances have a much larger decay rate to the 3\u03c0 mode. The obtained parameters of the \u03c9(1420) and \u03c9(1650) are summarized in Table II. The three-body final state is a relatively simple process for a study of hadron dynamics. Its Dalitz plot analysis shows that the \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c0 0 intermediate states dominate at all energies. There is also a small contribution of the \u03c9\u03c0 intermediate state with \u03c9 decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .

For ordinary isovector states, the \u03c6\u03c0 0 decay should be suppressed by the OZI rule. The authors perform two fits of the cross section. In the first one they assume a single resonance and obtain for it mass and width of 1593\u00b132 MeV/c 2 and 203 \u00b1 97 MeV, respectively. These parameters are compatible with those of the \u03c1(1700) (Amsler et al., 2008). A somewhat better quality of the fit is achieved if two resonances are assumed. The obtained parameters of the first resonance are 1570\u00b136\u00b162 MeV/c 2 for the mass and 144\u00b175\u00b143 MeV for the width, i.e., consistent with those of the C(1480) state observed in Ref. (Bityukov et al., 1987). The mass and width for the second resonance are 1909 \u00b1 17 \u00b1 25 MeV/c 2 and 48 \u00b1 17 \u00b1 2 MeV, respectively, compatible with the dip already observed in other experiments, predominantly in multipion final states (Antonelli et al., 1996;Aubert et al., 2006b;Baldini et al., 1988;Frabetti et al., 2000). With the limited statistics available at the moment they cannot draw a firm conclusion: an OZI-violating decay of the \u03c1(1700) cannot be excluded. Figure 28 shows the Dalitz plots for the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final states. It is seen that the KK * (892) and KK * 2 (1430) intermediate states give the main contribution to the KK\u03c0 production. For the K 0",

The large difference between the data sets from different experiments indicates that some previous measurements had large, up to 50%, unaccounted systematic errors. The BABAR systematic uncertainty on the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section is estimated to be about 5% in the 1-3 GeV energy range.

Unfortunately, such analysis was performed at BABAR only at a qualitative level. The two-and three-pion mass distributions for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state are relatively well described by the model of the a 1 (1260)\u03c0 intermediate state with a small contribution of the f 0 (1300)\u03c1 state. This agrees with the a 1 \u03c0 dominance hypothesis suggested in Ref. (Akhmetshin et al., 1999) to describe the 4\u03c0 dynamics at energies below 1.4 GeV. A strong deviation from this hypothesis is observed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 channel. In addition to the expected \u03c9\u03c0 0 and a 1 \u03c0 contributions, a surprisingly large contribution of the \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 intermediate state was observed. This is demonstrated in Fig. 32, where the 4\u03c0 mass spectra for \u03c9\u03c0, non-\u03c9\u03c0, and \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 intermediate states are shown together with the total mass spectrum for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 reaction. The contributions of the different intermediate states were separated using simple conditions on 3\u03c0 and 2\u03c0 invariant masses. It is seen that the \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 cross section is more than a half of the non-\u03c9\u03c0 cross section at the energy about 1.7 GeV. For the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 masses higher than 2.5 GeV/c 2 a clear signal of the f 0 (980) meson and a peak at the mass about 1.25 GeV/c 2 (probably from the f 2 (1270) meson) are seen in the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum corresponding to the contributions of the f 0 (980)\u03c1 and f 2 (1270)\u03c1 intermediate states.",

A small contribution of the K * 2 (1430)K\u03c0 state is also seen (Fig. 35(b)). A special correlation study (Lees et al., 2011) showed that the intermediate state with two K * , K * (892)K * (892), K * (892)K * 2 (1430), and K * 2 (1430)K * 2 (1430), contributes less than 1% to the total reaction yield (the associated K * (892)K * 2 (1430) production is observed in J/\u03c8 decays). Taking the numbers of events in the K * peaks for each c.m. energy interval, the \"inclusive\" e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 K\u03c0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * 2 (1430) 0 K\u03c0 cross sections shown in Fig. 36 were extracted. Figures 37(a) and 37(b) show scatter plots of the reconstructed a) m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and b) m(\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) versus m(K + K \u2212 ) for selected events of the reactions e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , respectively. A clear \u03c6(1020) signal is seen in the K + K \u2212 invariant mass in both figures and is discussed in more detail below. A signal of the \u03c1(770) is observed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in Fig. 37(a). The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution for K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events not containing the K * (892) meson is shown in Fig. 38 (a). The \u03c1(770) peak, probably corresponding to the intermediate K 1 (1230) \u00b1 and K 1 (1400) \u00b1 K \u2213 states, is clearly seen in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum. In Fig. 38 (b) the \"inclusive\" cross section for the K + K \u2212 \u03c1(770) reaction is presented. It is obtained by fitting the \u03c1(770) signal in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distributions for each c.m. energy interval in Fig. 38.",

For the ssss state, the observed Y (2175) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) is natural decay, while the not seen Y (2175) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (600) transition is suppressed by the OZI rule.

It is natural to expect that intermediate states for this reaction contain the \u03c6(1020) meson which has a large decay rate to K + K \u2212 . Indeed, the strong \u03c6 meson peak is seen in the K + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution shown in Fig. 46. Since the \u03c6 meson is present in almost each four-kaon event, it is concluded that the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 2(K + K \u2212 ) is strongly dominated by the \u03c6K + K \u2212 production.",

The K + K \u2212 pair forming the \u03c6 meson is selected by the requirement that its invariant mass is within \u00b110 MeV of the \u03c6 nominal mass. The invariant mass distribution for the second K + K \u2212 pair is shown in Fig. 47(a). Figures 47(b,c,d) show the cross section for events with the K + K \u2212 invariant mass in the regions 1, 2, and 3 indicated in Fig. 47(a). An enhancement in the K + K \u2212 invariant mass spectrum near the K + K \u2212 threshold can be interpreted as being due to decay f 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 . Therefore, the cross section for the region 1 is expected to have a structure similar to that observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0\u03c0 (see Sec. III.F). The bump at 2.175 GeV is indeed seen in the cross section shown in Fig. 47(b), however, the data sample is too low to perform a quantitative analysis. The relatively narrow region 2 with 1.06 GeV/c 2 < m(K + K \u2212 ) < 1.2 GeV/c 2 is responsible for the spike seen at 2.25 GeV in Fig. 45.

The three-pion and twokaon invariant mass spectra for this reaction are shown in Fig. 60. Clear \u03b7 and \u03c9 signals are seen in the three-pion mass distribution and a strong \u03c6 signal in the K + K \u2212 mass distribution. Figure 61 shows the calculated cross sections for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 (a) and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9K + K \u2212 (b) subprocesses. The former is in good agreement with that obtained in the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode (Aubert et al., 2008b). It is a first observation of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9K + K \u2212 . The reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 was also studied by BABAR in Ref. (Aubert et al., 2007c). The measured cross section is small and rises from threshold to a maximum value of about 0.2 nb at 2.8 GeV, followed by a monotonic decrease with increasing energy. The clear signal of the \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 (958) intermediate state is observed in the K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 mass distributions. Unfortunately, the \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 (958) invariant mass spectrum is not shown in Ref. (Aubert et al., 2007c). This spectrum is interesting since for the four-quark Y (2175) resonance (Sec. III.F) the decay to \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 (958) is expected.",

The ratio of the cross sections is almost constant over the energy range under study. Its average value is equal to 3.98 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.41. A dip structure just below 2 GeV in the six-pion cross section was observed in the DM2 experiment (Baldini et al., 1988) and then confirmed in the diffractive photoproduction of six pions in the FOCUS experiment (Frabetti et al., 2000). Such a dip at 1.9 GeV was also observed in the total cross section of e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons by the FENICE detector (Antonelli et al., 1996). This structure in BABAR data is fitted using the Breit-Wigner function coherent with the smooth non-resonant background. The fitted curves for both cross sections are shown in Fig. 63. The following \"resonance\" parameters are obtained:",

The cross section and the proton form factor were deduced assuming |G E | = |G M |. More precise measurements of the proton form factor have been performed in pp \u2192 e + e \u2212 experiments (Ambrogiani et al., 1999;Armstrong et al., 1993;Bardin et al., 1994). In the PS170 experiment (Bardin et al., 1994) at LEAR, the proton form factor was measured from threshold (pp annihilation at rest) up to a mass of 2.05 GeV/c 2 . The ratio |G E /G M | was measured using the angular dependence of the cross section and was found to be compatible with unity. The LEAR data show a strong dependence of the form factor on pp mass near threshold, and a weak dependence in the range 1.95-2.05 GeV/c 2 . The Fermilab experiments, E760 (Armstrong et al., 1993) and E835 (Ambrogiani et al., 1999), show that the form factor decreases rapidly at higher masses, in agreement with the perturbative QCD prediction G M \u221d \u03b1 2 s (m 2 )/m 4 .

However, the general quality of the BABAR detector and its particle identification in particular, are much better compared to the BESII detector. As a result, the detector efficiency and the integrated luminosity are determined with lower systematic errors.

The lower systematic error makes ISR results on many J/\u03c8 decays competitive with BESII and other previous measurements.

The dimuon mass spectrum for this reaction obtained by BABAR is shown in Fig. 74. The signal of the ISR J/\u03c8 production is well seen in the mass spectrum. The nonresonant spectrum is due to muon pair production in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3, where photon can be emitted by both initial electrons and final muons. Since the dimuon decay of the J/\u03c8 meson proceeds through a single photon transition, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , the angular and momentum distributions for events from the J/\u03c8 peak are completely identical to those for the ISR part of nonresonant events. The idea of the BABAR measurement is to determine the ratio of the number of J/\u03c8 events to the level of the nonresonant spectrum which is well known theoretically. The dimuon spectrum of Fig. 74 has been fit with a function taking into account the energy dependence of the nonresonant cross section and the experimental J/\u03c8 line shape. The ratio",

Since CLEO used the untagged approach, the FSR contribution to the nonresonant cross section was significantly reduced. The second important improvement of the method was that the J/\u03c8 line shape was extracted from data. To do this, the data collected by CLEO at the \u03c8(2S) resonance were used to select a clean sample of \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events.

The detection efficiency in the ISR method with a tagged photon is weakly sensitive to the dynamics of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 5\u03c0 decay. The model uncertainty in the detection efficiency for the BABAR measurement (Aubert et al., 2007c) was estimeted from the difference in efficiency values for phase-space generated five-pion events and events generated for the \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states.

To select these events, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 combination with the invariant mass closest to the J/\u03c8 mass is chosen. Figure 77(a) shows the scatter plot of this three-pion mass versus the five-pion mass. A clear signal from the above decay chain is seen. The fivepion mass spectrum for events with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass within the \u00b10.05 GeV/c 2 window around the J/\u03c8 mass is shown in Fig. 77(b).

By using the world-average \u0393(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and B(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) values (Amsler et al., 2008), the branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (2.36\u00b10.16\u00b10.16)% was obtained, which is in good agreement with the BABAR measurement in the 3\u03c0 final state: B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (2.18 \u00b1 0.19)% (Aubert et al., 2004b). This, in particular, confirms the correctness of the normalization procedure used for the measurement of B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 5\u03c0). Table III presents measurements of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decay rates performed with the BABAR detector via ISR for many multihadron final states. The current PDG values are shown in the last column (Nakamura et al., 2010). In most of the cases these values are close to those of BABAR emphasizing their importance. Note also that in a few cases the scale factor is significantly higher than one indicating a large difference between the BABAR measurement and previous results.",

Even such basic parameters of the \u03c8 mesons as mass, width and leptonic width were known with large uncertainties mainly determined by low statistics of the old experiments. In Ref. (Seth, 2005) an attempt was made to use the updated information on the R values from Crystal Ball (Osterheld et al., 1986) and BES (Bai et al., 2002) to improve these parameters. Finally, the BES Collaboration performed a global fit of the data on R collected by BES in the energy range from 3.7 to 5 GeV (Ablikim et al., 2008). In some cases the obtained values of mass, width and leptonic width for the \u03c8 states differ significantly from the older values and still suffer from big uncertainties caused by insufficient statistics and model dependence primarily due to numerous thresholds of charm production opening in this energy region. It became clear that serious progress would be possible after tedious exclusive studies, which recently became possible due to ISR analyses of BABAR and Belle based on very large integrated luminosities.",

The DD cross sections in the entire charm energy range from Belle (Pakhlova et al., 2008a) and BABAR (Aubert et al., 2007e) are shown in Figs. 80(a),(b) and are consistent with each other. Both exhibit clear evidence of structures near 4.1 and 4.4 GeV/c 2 . They also observe a structure (Figs. 80(a) and (b)) at 3900 MeV which must be taken into account to describe the DD cross section and R in the region between the \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4040). This enhancement is not considered as a new cc resonance, as it is qualitatively consistent with the energy dependence of the sum of the cross sections for various channels opening in this energy range predicted in a coupled-channel model (Eichten et al., 1980). The DD * cross sections from Belle (Pakhlova et al., 2007) and BABAR (Aubert et al., 2009b) shown in Figs. 80(c),(d) exhibit a single broad peak near threshold (close to the \u03c8(4040) position), whereas the D * D * results from Belle (Pakhlova et al., 2007) and BABAR (Aubert et al., 2009b) (Figs. 80(e),(f)) feature several local maxima and minima in this energy range.",

Because of the large number of the \u039b c decay channels with small branching fractions full reconstruction of both \u039b c is not effective. The strategy of a search for \u039b + c \u039b \u2212 c \u03b3 events at Belle (Pakhlova et al., 2008c) was the following: one of the \u039b c baryons was reconstructed using three decay modes pK 0 S , pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , \u039b\u03c0 + . Then in the spectrum of masses recoiling against the \u039b + c \u03b3 system, a peak at the \u039b \u2212 c mass was searched for. This peak presumably corresponded to the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c \u039b \u2212 c \u03b3. The resulting exclusive cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c \u039b \u2212 c is shown in Fig.80(i). The cross section is nearly flat from the threshold up to 5.4 GeV/c 2 except the region just above threshold, where a peak with the mass M = 4634 +10 \u221230 MeV/c 2 , width \u0393 = 92 +40 \u221227 MeV/c 2 and significance of 8.2 \u03c3 is observed. The state is denoted as X(4630) and the product of the branching fractions measured for it is B(e + e \u2212 )\u00d7B(\u039b c\u039bc ) = (0.68\u00b10.33)\u00d710 \u22126 . The nature of this enhancement remains unclear. Although both mass and width of the X(4630) are consistent within errors with those of another Belle state Y (4660), that was found in \u03c8(2S)\u03c0\u03c0 decays via ISR and is described in the next section (Wang et al., 2007), this could be coincidence and does not exclude other interpretations.",

BABAR (Aubert et al., 2007a) found one more apparent enhancement Y (4360) in \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which Belle (Wang et al., 2007) measured with somewhat larger mass and smaller width, as seen in Table VII. Belle also found a second structure near 4660 MeV/c 2 in the same final state, as seen in Fig. 83. (A combined fit (Liu et al., 2008) to Belle and BABAR \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data found consistency between them.) Because dipion transitions between vector quarkonia are commonplace for charmonium and bottomonium, it was natural to ascribe the Y 's to excited vector charmonia. A number of additional features of these states are in conflict with this hypothesis. Only one, Y (4660), is remotely near a predicted 1 \u2212\u2212 cc state (1 3 D 1 ). The Y (4260) and Y (4360) did not show up in inclusive hadronic cross section (R) measurements (Bai et al., 2002), as would be expected of such states (there is no fine-grained R-scan data near Y (4660)).",

For the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state the contribution of the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons is excluded. All values are in units of 10 \u221210 . agree with the corresponding old datasets. For example, from Fig. 23 discussed in Ch. 3 it is clear that the cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 obtained by BABAR (Aubert et al., 2004b) is consistent with that of SND (Achasov et al., 2002) below \u221a s = 1.4 GeV, but is much higher than that at DM2 (Antonelli et al., 1992) above this energy. The energy dependence of the cross section observed by DM2 is also inconsistent with other measurements (see the discussion of this problem in Ref. (Achasov et al., 2002)) and the existence of the rather well established \u03c9(1420) and \u03c9(1650) resonances. The contribution of this process to a had,LO \u00b5 , which was equal to (2.45\u00b10.26)\u202210 \u221210 before BABAR (Davier et al., 2003b), becomes (3.25 \u00b1 0.09) \u2022 10 \u221210 after the new results are taken into account (Davier, 2007). For the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 , which cross section is one of the largest above 1 GeV, the new BABAR measurement (Aubert et al., 2005b) is in good agreement with the older results and after taking them into account the precision of the corresponding contribution improves by a factor of two. Another example is the measurement of two six-pion final states (Aubert et al., 2006b). In Figs. 86 and 87 we compare the cross sections from BABAR with those in older measurements. It is clear that the improvement is dramatical because older measurements were too imprecise to make a reasonable prediction. We summarize the discussed contributions to a had,LO \u00b5 integrated from threshold to 1.8 GeV for the measurements before BABAR (see the references in Ref. (Davier et al., 2003b)) and with BABAR in Table IX (Davier, 2007).",

The most interesting final state is of course that with two pions, where a serious discrepancy be- tween the e + e \u2212 and \u03c4 data was reported (Davier et al., 2003a,b). The results of the most recent tests in this channel (Davier et al., 2010b(Davier et al., , 2011 are based on the reevaluation of isospin-breaking corrections. The predictions for the branching fraction of \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 shown in Table X. can be compared to the world average value of (25.51 \u00b1 0.09)% (Nakamura et al., 2010). Although the difference between the CVC prediction and the experimental value is less significant than previously (Davier et al., 2003b;Davier, 2007), it is still substantial for all groups but BABAR. A new approach to the problem was suggested very recently in Ref. (Jegerlehner and Szafron, 2011), where the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b3 mixing was properly taken into account. The CVC prediction for the branching fraction to two pions is (25.20 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b1 0.28)% in good agreement with the direct measurement. Finally, Ref. (Benayoun et al., 2011) reports consistent results on e + e \u2212 and \u03c4 in the 2\u03c0 channel and obtains a theoretical prediction for a \u00b5 , which is lower than the experimental value by 4.1\u03c3. One more test of CVC that included recent ISR results from BABAR has been performed in Ref. (Cherepanov and Eidelman, 2009). The authors use CVC together with the data on e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 to estimate the branching fraction of the corresponding \u03c4 decays.",
