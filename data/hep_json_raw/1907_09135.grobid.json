Taking advantage of the spin polarization in charmed baryon decays, we investigate the possibility to measure the weak decay asymmetry parameters in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039e 0 c\u039e 0 c process. We analyze the transverse polarization spontaneously produced in this process and the spin transfer in the subsequent \u039ec decays. The sensitivity to measure the asymmetry parameters are estimated for the decay \u039ec \u2192 \u039e\u03c0.",

Recently, precise measurements of the masses are coming from the hadron collider experiments [7,8]. Some exclusive decay modes are established by experiment, but its fundamental properties, such as the spin and parity, are still unconfirmed. Their quark contents are assigned as usc for \u039e + c and dsc for \u039e 0 c baryons. In SU (4) quark model, these two states are assigned as the 20-plet with SU (3) octet. Hence its spin and parity are assigned as 1 2 + .",

Compared with the charm meson decays, the W -exchange processes are believed to make significant contributions due to the absence of color and helicity suppressions. This argument is confirmed by the recent measurement of the branching fraction of \u039b + c \u2192 \u039e 0 K + [9]. However, it is difficult to make reliable calculations on this process since it involves nonfactorizable amplitudes. On the other hand, decay rates and asymmetry parameters for Cabbibo-favored decays, e.g. \u039e 0 c \u2192 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e + c \u2192 \u039e 0 \u03c0 + , are calculated by many groups [11][12][13][14][15][16].",

The charmed baryon carries a reverse polarization degree in the detector of east and west region, and has a net-zero degree of polarization in the full coverage of detector. To display its distribution versus cos \u03b8 in data analysis, a general way is to fill the distribution of sin \u03b81 sin \u03c61 versus cos \u03b8, which makes it independent on the measurement of angular distribution parameter \u03b1. Here the average is defined by sin \u03b81 sin \u03c61 = 1 N W\u039e(\u03b8, \u03b81, \u03c61) sin \u03b81 sin \u03c61d(cos \u03b81)d\u03c61",

We formulate the decay asymmetry parameter for the weak decay \u039ec \u2192 \u039e\u03c0, and we also show how the transverse polarization is transferred from the charmed baryon to the decayed \u039e hyperon.
