The data sample used in the search was collected in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . No evidence is found for lepton flavour violating decays in either final state. Upper limits on the branching fractions, B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < 0.69% and B(H \u2192 e\u03bc) < 0.035%, are set at the 95% confidence level. The constraint set on B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) is an order of magnitude more stringent than the existing indirect limits. The limits are used to constrain the corresponding flavour violating Yukawa couplings, absent in the standard model.",

In the standard model (SM), lepton flavour violating (LFV) decays of the Higgs boson are forbidden. Such decays can occur naturally in models with more than one Higgs boson doublet [4]. They also arise in supersymmetric models [5][6][7][8][9][10][11], composite Higgs models [12,13], models with flavour symmetries [14], Randall-Sundrum models [15][16][17], and others [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. The CMS Collaboration has recently published a search in the H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 channel [27] showing an excess of data with respect to the SM background-only hypothesis at m H = 125 GeV with a significance of 2.4 standard deviations (\u03c3 ).",

The momenta of charged particles are measured with a silicon pixel and strip tracker that covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, in a 3.8 T axial magnetic field. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, both consisting of a barrel section and two endcaps, cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 3.0. A steel and quartz-fibre Cherenkov forward detector extends the calorimetric coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. The outermost component of the CMS detector is the muon system, consisting of gas-ionization detectors placed in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet to identify the muons traversing the detector. The twolevel CMS trigger system selects events of interest for permanent storage. The first trigger level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events in less than 3.2 \u03bcs. The software algorithms of the high-level trigger, executed on a farm of commercial processors, reduce the event rate to less than 1 kHz using information from all detector subsystems.",

The muons are then replaced with simulated \u03c4 decays reconstructed with the PF algorithm. Thus, the key features of the event topology such as jet multiplicity, instrumental sources of E miss T , and the underlying event are taken directly from collision data. Only the \u03c4 lepton decays are simulated. The normalization of the sample is obtained from simulation. The technique is validated by comparing the collinear mass distributions obtained from the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 simulation and the embedding technique applied to a simulated sample of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events. A shift of 2% in the mass peak of the embedded sample relative to simulation is observed. This shift reflects a bias in the embedding technique, which does not take the differences between muons and taus in final-state radiation of photons into account, and is corrected for. Identification and isolation corrections obtained from the comparison are applied to the embedded sample.",

The probability for PF objects to be misidentified as leptons is measured using an independent collision data set, defined below, and this probability is applied to the background enriched sample to compute the misidentified lepton background in the signal sample. The technique is shown schematically in In the H \u2192 e\u03c4 h channel either lepton candidate can arise from a misidentified PF object, predominantly in W + jets and QCD multijet events, but also from Z \u2192 ee + jets and tt production. The misidentification rates f \u03c4 and f e are defined as the fraction of loosely isolated \u03c4 h or electron candidates that also pass a tight isolation requirement. This is measured in Z \u2192 ee + X collision data events, where X is an object identified as a \u03c4 h or e. The misidentified \u03c4 h contribution is estimated with Region I defined as the signal selection. Region III is the signal selection except the \u03c4 h is required to have loose and not tight isolation. The misidentified \u03c4 h lepton background in Region I is then estimated by multiplying the event yield in Region III by a factor f \u03c4 /(1 \u2212 f \u03c4 ). The same procedure is used to estimate the misidentified electron background by defining Region I as the signal selection and Region III as the signal selection but with a loose and not tight isolated electron, and scaling by f e /(1 \u2212 f e ). To avoid double counting, the event yield in Region III, multiplied by a factor f e /(1 \u2212 f e ) \u00d7 f \u03c4 /(1 \u2212 f \u03c4 ), is subtracted from the sum of misidentified electrons and taus. The procedure is validated with the like-sign e\u03c4 samples. Fig. 2 (right) shows the collision data in Region II compared to the estimate ",

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties that lead to a change in the shape of the M col distribution are summarized in Table 5. A 2% shift in the M col distribution of the embedded Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 sample used to estimate the background is observed relative to simulation. It occurs only in the H \u2192 e\u03c4 \u03bc channel as the effects of bremsstrahlung from the muon are neglected in the simulation. The M col distribution is corrected by 2 \u00b1 2% for this effect. There is a systematic uncertainty of 5% in Z \u2192 ee background in the H \u2192 e\u03c4 h channel, due to the mismeasured energy of the electron reconstructed as a \u03c4 h . It causes a shift in the M col distribution, estimated by comparing collision data with simulation in a control region of Z \u2192 ee events in which one of the two electrons that form the Z peak is also identified as a \u03c4 h [63]. Corrections are applied for the jet energy scale and resolution [66]. They are determined with dijet and \u03b3 /Z + jets collision data and the most significant uncertainty arises from the photon energy scale. Other uncertainties such as jet fragmentation modelling, single pion response, and uncertainties in the pileup corrections are also included. The jet energy scale uncertainties (3-7%) are applied as a function of p T and \u03b7, including all correlations, to all jets in the event, propagated to the E miss T , and the resultant M col distribution is used in the fit. There is also an additional uncertainty to account for the unclustered energy scale uncertainty. The unclustered energy comes from jets below 10 GeV and PF candidates not within jets. It is also propagated to E miss T . These effects cause a shift of the M col distribution. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution is used to smear the jets as a function of p T and \u03b7 and the recomputed M col distribution is used in the fit. A 3% uncertainty in the \u03c4 h energy scale is estimated by comparing Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events in collision data and simulation. Potential uncertainties in the shape of the misidentified lepton backgrounds are also considered. In the H \u2192 e\u03c4 \u03bc channel the misidentified lepton rates are applied in bins of p T and \u03b7. In the H \u2192 e\u03c4 h channel, the \u03c4 h misidentification rate is found to be approximately independent of p T but to depend on \u03b7. These rates are all varied by one standard deviation and the differences in the shapes are used as nuisance parameters in the fit. Finally, the distributions used in the fit have statistical uncertainties in each mass bin which is included as an uncertainty that is uncorrelated between the bins.",

The uncertainty in the signal yield from the lepton isolation and identification corrections is 2.0% and is estimated with the \"tag-and-probe\" method [72] applied to a collision data sample of Z bosons decaying to lepton pairs [60,62]. The uncertainties in the lepton energy scale and the dilepton mass resolution are taken from the H \u2192 ZZ analysis [61]. The systematic uncertainty in the pileup modelling is evaluated by varying the total inelastic cross section by \u00b15% [74].

There are systematic uncertainties in the efficiency of the b quark jet veto that also vary with production process and category from 0.05% to 0.7%.

The misidentified muon background is estimated with Region I defined as the signal selection with an isolated electron and an isolated muon of opposite charge. Region III is defined as the signal selection except the muon is required not to be isolated. Small background sources of prompt leptons are subtracted using simulation. The misidentified muon background in Region I is then estimated by multiplying the event yield in Region III by a factor f \u03bc , where f \u03bc is the ratio of isolated to nonisolated muons. It is computed on an independent collision data sample of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc + X events, where X is an object identified as a muon, in bins of muon p T and \u03b7. In the estimation of f \u03bc , background sources of three prompt leptons, predominantly WZ and ZZ, are subtracted from the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc + X sample using simulation. The technique is validated using like-sign lepton collision data in Regions II and IV. InFig. 2(left) the event yield in Region II is compared to the estimate from scaling the Region IV sample by the measured misidentification rate. The Region II sample is dominated by misidentified leptons but also includes small contributions of true leptons arising from vector boson decays, estimated with simulated samples.",

The shaded regions in the right plot are derived constraints from null searches for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 (dark green), \u03bc \u2192 3e (light blue) and \u03bc \u2192 e conversions (grey). The purple diagonal line is the theoretical naturalness limit Y ij Y ji \u2264 m i m j /v 2 [33]. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) changing neutral currents are dominated by the Higgs boson contributions. However, this limit can be degraded by the cancellation of lepton flavour violating effects from other new physics. The direct search for H \u2192 e\u03bc decays presented here is therefore complementary to indirect limits obtained from searches for rare decays at lower energies. = 125 GeV. These limits are used to constrain the Y e\u03c4 and Y e\u03bc Yukawa couplings as follows: |Y e\u03c4 | 2 + |Y \u03c4 e | 2 < 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and |Y e\u03bc | 2 + |Y \u03bce | 2 < 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 95% CL.",
