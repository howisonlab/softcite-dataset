The neutrons produced by cosmic-ray muons in their interactions with matter are called cosmogenic. Deepinelastic \u03c0A-collisions of pions in muon-induced hadronic showers are mainly their source at energies above 30 MeV. The characteristics of the energy spectrum for the generation of cg-neutrons have been determined by invoking the additive quark model of deep-inelastic soft processes and the mechanism for the interactions of high-energy nucleons in a nucleus. The three-component shape of the spectrum is explained, and the energy of the \"knee\" in the spectrum has been found to depend on the mass number A. The peculiarities of deepinelastic \u03c0A-scattering lead to the conclusion that the spectrum of cg-neutrons steepens sharply at energies above 1 GeV. The calculated quantitative characteristics of the spectrum are compared with those obtained in measurements.",

A relationship of the yield Y n to the energy losses of ultrarelativistic muons and the mass number of matter A has been established on the basis of experimental data [1]. An analytical expression that allows the yield Y n and, consequently, the flux and production rate of cg-neutrons to be calculated with a sufficient accuracy for any A at depths greater than 100 m w.e., where the mean energy of the muon flux E \u00b5 > 40 GeV, has been derived.",

These showers are initiated by deep-inelastic \u00b5Ascattering \u00b5A \u2192 k\u03c0 + mN + (A \u2212 m) + \u00b5 \u2032 (k and m are the multiplicities of the produced pions and nucleons, m\u2264A) and develop in matter due to the multiplication of pions in deep-inelastic \u03c0A-collisions: \u03c0A \u2192 k\u03c0 + mN + (A \u2212 m). In both \u00b5A-and \u03c0A-reactions the multiple production of pions is the result of an inelastic collision of the incident particle with one of the intranuclear nucleons. The multiple generation of pions occurs mainly in deep-inelastic soft processes, which make a major contribution to the cross section for the deep-inelastic interaction of hadrons. These processes are characterized by small transverse momenta of generated pions p \u22a5 < 1 GeV/c, in contrast to the hard ones with p \u22a5 > 1 GeV/c. Let us consider the production of neutrons in h-showers in terms of the quark model of strong interactions. In the additive quark model the elastic qq-scattering of two quasi-free valence (structural) quarks (current quarks interact in hard processes) underlies the soft multiple processes. This process can be depicted by a quark diagram (Fig. 2). In this representation of \u03c0N-interaction the antiquark of the incident pion q \u03c0 is elastically scattered by the quark q N of the target nucleon N. Both quarks acquire momenta sufficient for their escape from the confinements of the interacting hadrons. The breaking of the gluon bond of the scattered antiquark q \u03c0 to the spectator quark q \u03c0 gives rise to virtual qq-pairs with their subsequent recombination into a jet of fragmentation pions. The number of recombined qq-pairs and, consequently, pions is determined by the energy of the antiquark q \u03c0 . There is also a leading pion with an energy of about 1/2 of the initial one produced by the spectator quark q \u03c0 and the pair antiquark q among the fragmentation Figure 1: Energy spectra F s (T n ) for the generation of neutrons by muons of fixed energy E \u00b5 calculated by the Monte Carlo method for various materials: (a) LS, FLUKA, E \u00b5 = 285 GeV [12]; (b) LS, FLUKA and Geant4 (histogram), E \u00b5 = 280 GeV [11]; (c) Pb, FLUKA, E \u00b5 = 300 GeV [14]; (d) LS, Geant4, E \u00b5 = 280 GeV [13]; (e) soil, Geant4, E \u00b5 = 275 GeV [15]; (f) Pb, Geant4, E \u00b5 = 260 GeV [16].",

In the QCD theory of strong interactions this quantity corresponds to the scale of gluon vacuum fluctuations with a characteristic nucleon size \u223c 1 Fm (10 \u221213 cm), which is the nucleon confinement size. When gaining an additional momentum (in our case, from q \u03c0 ), the quark q N can reach the confinement boundary (nucleon periphery).

As a result, the r-nucleon formed from the diquark q N q N gains a momentum p r directed along the motion of the escaping quark in the nucleus whose mean value must correspond to the string tension at a confinement size \u223c 1 Fm, i.e., p r \u2248 0.35 GeV/c, which leads to the equality p r \u2248 p h \u22a5 .

In the KARMEN experiment the neutrons were generated by muons and showers mainly in a 7000-ton iron shield surrounding a 65 m 3 liquid scintillation detector. The crossing by a muon of the planes of the active detector shield, which recorded the time and coordinates of the muon-shower event, was a trigger for recording neutrons. The events of iron-shield crossing by a muon containing the detector pulses correlated with the muon were selected for the analysis. Since the main goal of the KARMEN experiment was to investigate the \u03bdA-cross sections in a beam of accelerator neutrinos, the facility was at a small depth underground. The neutrons from atmospheric muons were studied as a background source in the measurements. The mean energy of the muons passing through the shield corresponded to a depth of \u223c 40 m w.e., i.e., it was \u223c 15 GeV. Muons of such an energy produce mostly cv-neutrons, because the dominant channels of their generation are the \u00b5 \u2212 Acapture and photoproduction by virtual photons. Nevertheless, recording the temporal, spatial, and energy characteristics of scintillation detector pulses allowed one to establish the energy releases of \u03b4-neutrons escaping from the iron shield and then to determine the shape of the spectrum of \"visible\" energy releases in the energy range 20 \u2212 80 MeV. The authors of [7] fitted the spectrum of recorded cg-neutron energy releases F (\u03b5 vis ) by the law exp(\u2212\u03b5 vis /\u03b5 0 ), where \u03b5 0 \u2248 42 MeV (Fig. 4). As follows from the graph, in the range 30 \u2212 80 MeV being discussed 38 and 19 of the 59 experimental data points lie, respectively, above and below the straight line representing the law exp(\u2212\u03b5 vis /42); two points visually agree with the fit. The discrepancy between the experiment and the dependence exp(\u2212\u03b5 vis /42) is most pronounced in the tail of the spectrum: at a measurement uncertainty of about 35% in the energy range 60 \u2212 80 MeV 17 of the 20 data points lie above the straight line. The exponential with \u03b5 0 = 57.8 \u00b1 9.4 is the best fit to the KARMEN data in the range 20 \u2212 80 MeV. The significant error in \u03b5 0 is related to the determination of count rates from the graph in Fig. 4. Taking this fact into account, we assume below that \u03b5 0 \u223c 60 MeV. This value is supported by the result of the Soudan experiment [10] described below.",

The curve F (\u03b5 \u03b4 vis ) represents the dependence N(T \u03b4 ) \u221d T \u22121 \u03b4 , where the energy T \u03b4 was recalculated to the visible energy releas \u03b5 \u03b4 vis using the quenching function q(T \u03b4 ) = \u03b5 \u03b4 vis /T \u03b4 obtained for an organic liquid scintillator (LS) with an approximate composition C 10 H 20 in [22]. Here, the neutron was assumed to transfer all its energy T \u03b4 to one recoil proton, i.e., T p = T \u03b4 . In reality, the neutron in LS loses its energy in portions in np-scatterings and elastic and inelastic nC-collisions. This assumption affects insignificantly the shape of the curve F (\u03b5 \u03b4 vis ). The curves in Fig. 5 were normalized to the number of events at the energy release \u03b5 vis = 30 MeV corresponding to T \u03b4 = 47 MeV.

The dashed line is the best fit to the data by the law exp(\u03b5 vis /60MeV ) in the range 30 \u2212 80 MeV. and F (\u03b5 \u03b4 vis ) show that the KARMEN experimental data in the range 30 \u2212 80 MeV can be fitted by the law T \u22121 \u03b4 . The experiment [10] in an underground laboratory at a depth of 2100 m w.e. (E \u00b5 \u223c 210 GeV) at the Soudan mine (USA) was aimed at determining the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ). The measurements were performed with a cylindrical counter (\u2298 = 13 cm, L = 100 cm) filled with 12 L of LS. The range of measured energies \u03b5 vis is from 4 to 60 MeV. The range was limited from above by the electronics capabilities. The interaction of neutrons in LS was separated from the interactions of electrons, \u03b3-ray photons, and muons by the PMT pulse shape. The low statistics of 24 events in 655 days of measurements underground did not allow definitive conclusions about the shape of the spectrum in the range 30 \u2212 60 MeV to be reached. Of interest are the results obtained by the authors during the calibration measurements on the Earths surface: the spectrum of neutron energies \u03b5 vis in the range 30 \u2212 56 MeV, \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b5 vis /60MeV ) ( Fig. 6), coincided with the corrected KARMEN spectrum (Fig. 4). Thus, the authors of [10] obtained the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) on the surface. This fact can be explained by the detection of \u03b4-neutrons generated by extensive air shower (EAS) pions in the roof and walls of the Figure 5: Spectra of recorded cg-neutron energies \u03b5 vis in the range 30 \u2212 80 MeV.

The measured spectrum in the range 30 \u2212 400 MeV with a knee near 90 MeV corresponds to the \u03b4-neutron production spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) obtained underground in the LVD experiment [8]. On the surface neutrons with energies above 30 MeV could also be generated by EAS pions in the roof of the experimental room. The similarity of the spectra of neutrons at energies above 30 MeV obtained on the surface and underground has a natural explanation: in both cases, they are generated by h-shower pions in deep-inelastic \u03c0A-scattering, whereby the energy characteristics of the produced \u03b4-neutrons do not depend on the pion energy.",

The LS and Fe masses are identical, the LS composition is C k H 2k , k \u2248 10. The spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) of neutrons produced by nearly vertical muons in the target column (t-column) of the facility 6.2 m in length, 2.2 m in width, and 7.5 m in height (56 counters with an LS mass of 67 t and the same Fe mass) was reconstructed from the spectrum of \"visible\" neutron energy releases in 60 scintillation counters of the detecting volume (d-volume) with an LS mass of 72 t [8]. The d-volume is separated from the t-column by a 78 g cm \u22122 LS layer and iron layers with a total thickness of 45 g cm \u22122 contained in the separating half-column (28 counters). The half-column, which incorporates Figure 7: Energy spectrum of cg-neutrons in the LVD experiment [8], N n is the number of neutrons. light and heavy materials, efficiently shields the d-volume from the particles of the electromagnetic (\u03b3, e) and hadronic (p, \u03c0 \u00b1 ) components of the emand h-showers developing in the t-column. At the same time, the separating half-column with this composition and sizes slightly deforms the shape of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ). This is explained by the following factors. While crossing the half-column, the neutrons with energies T > 30 MeV interact mainly with C and Fe nuclei. In elastic nC-and nFe-scatterings the neutrons lose less than 10% of their energy. During an inelastic nA-interaction the \u03b4-neutrons with energies above 30 MeV initiate the development of INCs in the nucleus, which leads to fragmentation of the energy T \u03b4 and practically disappearance of the neutrons with an energy above 30 MeV that experienced inelastic nA- scattering. Since the cross section for this process, while slightly varying, is essentially independent of the incident neutron energy (Fig. 8), the inelastic scattering affects insignificantly the shape of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ).",

The sought-for spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) is formed by the neutrons produced in deep-inelastic \u03c0C-, \u03c0Fe-, and \u03c0p-interactions whose fractions in the total number of \u03c0A-interactions are 48% (\u03c0C), 37% (\u03c0Fe), and 15% (\u03c0p). In contrast to the spectrum F s (\u03c0p) \u221d 1/T \u22122 \u03b4 , the spectra of \u03b4-neutrons in carbon and iron change their shape at 72 and 124 MeV, respectively. Since the fraction of \u03c0p-interactions is small, the measured spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) is formed by the neutrons from \u03c0C-and \u03c0Fe-interactions. As a consequence, the spectrum of \u03b4-neutrons is described by the dependence T \u22121 \u03b4 in the energy range from 30 to \u223c 70 MeV and by the law T \u22122 \u03b4 above 120 MeV.

The range 70 \u2212 120 MeV is transitional. Since the \u03c0C-and \u03c0Fe-contributions are comparable, the shape of the sought-for spectrum can be assumed to change at an energy \u223c 100 MeV, i.e., T cr \u03b4 (LS + Fe) \u2248 100 MeV.

The flux of \u03b4-neutrons underground is characterized by a significant directivity from top to bottom. This is explained, first, by the strong anisotropy of the angular distribution of muons I \u00b5 (\u03b8) \u221d cos n \u03b8 \u00b5 with an exponent n \u2248 2 \u2212 5 at a depth of 1000 \u2212 4000 m w.e. under the flat surface, second, by the development of an h-shower along the muon trajectory, and, third, by the escape of \u03b4-neutrons from nuclei in a narrow cone along the motion of the shower pions. The energy dependence of the total nA-interaction cross section in the range 30 \u2212 150 MeV in a standard rock is similar to the energy dependence of the cross section \u03c3 nN \u221d T \u22121 n (Fig. 8). The mean free path of \u03b4-neutrons \u03bb \u03b4 with energies 30 \u2212 150 MeV lies within the range from 8 to 40 cm. The above peculiarities of cosmogenic particles underground in combination with the \u03b4-neutron isolation condition determine the region from which the neutrons arrive at the detector. It is located above the detector and around its upper part. Apart from the relationship between the detector and chamber surfaces, the shape and sizes of the region depend on the mean free path \u03bb \u03b4 and the angular distribution of \u03b4-neutrons. The number P D (T \u03b4 ) of is-neutrons incident on the detector is proportional to the volume of this region V (T \u03b4 ):",

            "text": "The cg-neutron production spectrum is explained in terms of the quark model of deep-inelastic \u03c0A-scattering. The spectrum is formed by the interactions in nuclei of atoms of the medium. The characteristics of the spectrum (the shape, the mean energy, the knee energy, the mean energies of the spectral ranges) are related to the mechanism for the qq collision of the valance quark of an incident pion with the valence quark of a nucleon in the target nucleus and the passage of the recoil neutron through the nuclear matter. The spectrum of cg-neutrons occupies the range from zero to \u223c 1 GeV and consists of three components. The first component (energies up to 30 MeV) is dominated by evaporative neutrons with a Maxwellian spectrum. The \u03b4neutrons with a spectrum 1/T \u03b4 present here have virtually no effect on the shape of the resulting spectrum. The mean energy 4 \u2212 7 MeV of neutrons in this spectral range is determined by the value of A and is unrelated to E \u00b5 . The neutrons of thefirst component account for 75 \u2212 80% of the total number of cg-neutrons, depending on A. The \u03b4-neutrons of deep-inelastic \u03c0Ascattering constitute the second and third components spanning the energy range from 30 MeV to \u223c 1 GeV. The spectrum of \u03b4-neutrons F s (T \u03b4 ) has a characteristic shape representable in a logarithmic scale by a straight line with a knee at energy T cr \u03b4 . The source of \u03b4-neutrons with energies above 30 MeV are h-showers. The neutrons of em-showers and those produced in other processes do not affect the shape of the spectrum. The shape of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) originates from the energy spectrum of \u03b4-particles 1/T 2 \u03b4 that characterizes the elastic scattering of quasi-free valance quarks. The spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) is formed by those of the recoil neutrons that escape from the nuclei without collisions. As a result of the interactions of recoil neutrons in the nuclei, the spectrum 1/T 2 \u03b4 in the range from 30 MeV to the knee energy T cr \u03b4 takes the shape of the second component 1/T \u03b4 . The neutrons of the third component from T cr \u03b4 to \u223c 1 GeV have a spectrum 1/T 2 \u03b4 , because they all escape from the nuclei without collisions. The energy of the knee T cr \u03b4 in the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) depends on A as T cr \u03b4 \u221d A 1/4 ; for nuclei with A \u2264 4 the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) takes a mono shape proportional to T \u22122 \u03b4 , while for A = 207 (Pb) the second component of the spectrum proportional to T \u22121 \u03b4 reaches an energy of \u223c 190 MeV. The mean energy of \u03b4-neutrons, T \u03b4 \u223c (120 \u2212 150) MeV is weakly related to A and does not depend on the shower pion energy. As a consequence, the shape of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) and the energy T \u03b4 of neutrons generated in the rock remain unchanged with increasing depth and correspondingly rising mean muon energy E \u00b5 . For the same reason, the shape of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) in the atmosphere must closely follow the shape of the cg-neutron spectrum underground.",

The main factor that determines the shape of the spectrum F is (T \u03b4 ) is the dimensions of the area from which the \u03b4-neutrons reach the detector. Under the action of this factor the second component of the spectrum F s (T \u03b4 ) acquires the shape F is (T \u03b4 ) \u221d T \u22120.6 \u03b4 , while the third component proportional to T \u22122 \u03b4 is transformed into T \u22122.6 \u03b4 .",

No cutoff has been established so far in measurements, because it is fairly difficult to determine the energy of cg-neutrons in this energy range experimentally. The spectra of cg-neutrons obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation show no sharp change in their shape at energies above 1 GeV (Fig. 1). At the same time, the effect of limiting nuclear fragmentation in a deep-inelastic hadron nucleus interaction and the behavior of the cross section \u03c3 nN (Fig. 3) at T n \u2265 1 GeV (implying the dominance of pion production in \u03c0N-collisions with neutron energy loss both inside and outside the nucleus) point to the existence of a cutoff in the spectrum of cg-neutrons.",

The proposed fits to the data of these simulations by the function T \u2212\u03b1 n at \u03b1 = const [27], the sum of exponentials exp(\u2212aT n ), or a combination of these functions [12], [28], [29] do not clarify the cg-neutron spectrum formation mechanism. Monte Carlo calculations do not yet provide simulations of the generation of neutrons by highenergy muons that fit the real one. Knowing the physical processes shaping the spectrum of cg-neutrons allows the Monte Carlo codes needed for the optimization of experiments and the calculation of background effects to be selected and corrected.",
