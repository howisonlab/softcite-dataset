The determination of this inefficiency is important for jet energy scale and mass calibration, as well as multiple other performance studies and analyses. A data driven method is used, where the fraction of lost particle tracks is determined from energy deposition dE/dx in the pixel detector. The fraction of lost tracks is found to be less than 5%, which is an improvement since the previous study, and agrees well within systematic uncertainties with a Monte Carlo simulation.",

Examples include btagging and boosted \u03c4 reconstruction, jet energy scale and mass determination, and analyses using jet substructure information. The leading source of systematic uncertainty is in many cases the uncertainty on track reconstruction efficiency. Thus, it is necessary to maintain a high tracking efficiency also inside of jets, and to determine the (in-)efficiency precisely.",

Clusters shared between multiple tracks are penalized during reconstruction, to ensure high quality tracks, as one of the tracks in this case is likely to be fake. However, in dense environments this is a disadvantage, since clusters from close-by tracks can naturally merge. To account for this, an artificial neural network is trained to identify and not penalize such merged clusters [1,2]. This greatly increases the percentage of correct associations of clusters to tracks at small track separations, and improves b-tagging and \u03c4 reconstruction performance. To determine the remaining inefficiency of tracking in dense environments, a data driven method is applied, where the fraction of lost tracks is determined from the energy deposition dE/dx in the pixel detector (section 4).",

Events were selected passing single jet triggers, with a minimal jet p T threshold of 100 GeV.
