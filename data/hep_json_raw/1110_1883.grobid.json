            "text": "The ALICE experiment has the ability to measure, in addition to other observables, open heavy flavor production in different colliding systems at the LHC. Charm and beauty production in proton proton collisions at the LHC are an important tool to test pQCD calculations in a new energy domain. Their spectra in heavy ion interactions are influenced by the formation of hot and dense QCD matter. Due to their relative large mass and the difference between quark and gluon color charge, the medium effects in heavy flavor hadrons are expected to differ from those of light hadrons. RHIC results show that heavy quarks effectively lose energy in the medium through (elastic and/or inelastic) interactions, but a possible quark-mass hierarchy has not yet been elucidated. LHC measurements at higher energies, with larger cross sections and better capabilities to separate charm and beauty production, will help to answer these questions.",

It is characterized by its ability to track particles from very low (\u223c 100 MeV/c) up to fairly high (\u223c 100 GeV/c) transverse momenta. The central barrel, equipped with a solenoid magnet of up to 0.5 T, is in charge of tracking and identifying charged particles and photons. From the vertex region to the outer part it is composed of a vertex detector, the Inner Tracking System (ITS), a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC), a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) for electron identification, and a Time Of Flight detector (TOF) to identify protons, kaons and pions, all of them with full azimuthal acceptance. The muon spectrometer is equipped with a dipole magnet of up to 0.7 T, and is responsible for muon tracking and reconstruction. The V0 detector comprising two scintillator hodoscopes located in the forward and backward regions, is involved in fast triggering and centrality determination. The minimum bias trigger is activated by the presence of at least a signal in either of two V0 scintillator hodoscopes, or in the two inner layers of the ITS. The experiment is completed by a set of global and central detectors that are not used in the measurements presented here.",

The heavy flavor electron spectrum was obtained subtracting a cocktail of the non-heavy-flavor sources from the inclusive electron spectrum and applying the acceptance and efficiency corrections. The cocktail was built based on the measured \u03c0 0 , J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 spectrum (the last two only in pp), heavier meson spectra from the measured \u03c0 0 via m T scaling, and direct \u03b3 from NLO pQCD calculations.

Prompt D mesons were studied at both 7 TeV and 2.76 TeV in pp interactions. Their transverse momentum distributions were also well described by the existent pQCD calculations (FONLL [2] and GM-VFNS [3]) at both energies, the measurement and theoretical uncertainties not allowing to favor any of them. The extrapolation of the D meson measurements (down to p t = 2 GeV/c) to the full kinematic phase space allowed to evaluate the total charm production cross section. Its dependence with the system center of mass energy, shown in Fig. 1 left, illustrates the compatibility of the different experiments, and the seemingly good description of its energy evolution by the MNR pQCD calculations [4]. The beauty decay electron differential p t spectrum at 7 TeV (see Fig. 1 right) also presents a good agreement with FONLL pQCD calculations. . The influence of the hot and dense QCD medium created in these heavy ion interactions was probed computing the nuclear modification factor, R AA = Y AA /( N coll \u00d7 Y pp ), as the ratio of the invariant yields in the PbPb and pp collisions at the same energy normalized by the average number of nucleon nucleon collisions (see Fig. 2). For all the herein mentioned measurements (single muons, single electrons, D mesons), the pp reference was obtained by extrapolating the 7 TeV measurements presented in the previous section to 2.76 TeV [5]. The scaling factor was calculated from pQCD calculations and its uncertainty determined by the spread of the scaling varying the prediction parameters: quark mass, renormalization and factorization scales. The scaling procedure was validated by comparing the results to the existing measurements and to other predictions (MNR, GM-VFNS).",

The inclusive muon distribution at intermediate p t , mainly populated by heavy flavor decays, shows a suppression of their production rate in good agreement with that of the heavy flavor decay electrons in a different pseudo-rapidity range. Prompt charm at mid-rapidity is also suppressed, consistently with heavy flavor leptons and charged pions.
