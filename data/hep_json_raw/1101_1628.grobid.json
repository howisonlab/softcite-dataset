The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in events with jets and significant missing transverse energy, characteristic of the decays of heavy, pair-produced squarks and gluinos. The primary background, from standard model multijet production, is reduced by several orders of magnitude to a negligible level by the application of a set of robust kinematic requirements. With this selection, the data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds, namely tt, W + jet and Z + jet production, which are estimated from data control samples. Limits are set on the parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. These limits extend those set previously by experiments at the Tevatron and LEP colliders.",

Nevertheless, it is widely believed to be only an effective description of a more complete theory, which supersedes it at higher energy scales. Of particular theoretical interest is supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6], which solves the \"hierarchy problem\" [7,8] of the SM at the expense of introducing a large number of supersymmetric particles with the same quantum numbers as the SM particles, but differing by half a unit of spin. If R-parity conservation [9] is assumed, supersymmetric particles are produced in pairs and decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). If the LSP is neutral and weakly-interacting, it goes undetected giving rise to a signature with missing energy.",

Furthermore, to select a pure multijet topology, events are vetoed in which an isolated photon [29] with p T > 25 GeV is found. These vetoes reject 5% of the previously selected events in data and simulation. At this preselection stage, the background from multijet production, as predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is still several orders of magnitude larger than the typical signal expected from SUSY. The H T distribution for the selected events is shown in Fig. 1 and compared to simulation-based background estimates. The QCD multijet background is estimated using the pythia6.4 [30] Monte Carlo generator with tune Z2 [31]. Electroweak backgrounds from W + jets, Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd + jets and tt + jets events, which will be referred to collectively as the electroweak (EWK) backgrounds in what follows, are simulated using MadGraph [32]. The SM distribution, i.e. the sum of the QCD multijet and EWK distributions, is indicated in Fig. 1 as a hatched band representing the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties from the jet energy scale and resolution. The expected H T distributions for two low-mass SUSY signal points, LM0 and LM1, are overlaid. With the exception of tt, the SM processes fall off exponentially over the entire H T range, whereas a broad peak at values of a few hundred of GeV is expected for the signal models. The selection is tightened by requiring the H T of all jets to exceed 350 GeV, thus ensuring large hadronic activity in the event. This requirement substantially reduces the contributions from SM processes while maintaining a high efficiency for the SUSY topologies considered.",

The background estimate is insensitive to this variation: since R R \u2248 1, the change in the estimate is always much smaller than the statistical uncertainty. Even under extreme variations of the individual EWK processes by up to five times higher values than those predicted by simulation, the systematic uncertainty is at least a factor two smaller than the statistical uncertainty.

The final states with two or more hadronic jets and significant missing transverse energy, as expected from high-mass squark and gluino production and decays, have been analysed in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb \u22121 . A search for a SUSY signal has been performed at high values of the scalar sum of the transverse energy of jets, H T . The primary background, from QCD multijet events, has been reduced by several orders of magnitude down to a negligible level using a robust set of requirements designed specifically for the exploratory, early data-taking phase of the experiment. The sum of standard model backgrounds has been estimated from an extrapolation of the data observed at lower H T values. The only remaining backgrounds have been found to stem from electroweak processes, namely W + jet, Z + jet, and tt production, where the weak decays of the vector bosons involve high-momentum neutrinos. An independent estimate of the electroweak backgrounds, from W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd + jets decays as well as \u03b3 + jets events in the data together with input from simulation, has been found to be well compatible with the estimate from control samples in data. Here, conservatively large systematic uncertainties have been assigned to the background estimates. The measurements are in agreement with the expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits on the CMSSM parameters have been derived, and have been shown to improve significantly those set by previous experiments.",
