The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the Standard Model background. In addition to an inclusive dijet search, events with jets identified as containing b-hadrons are examined specifically. No significant excess of events above the smoothly falling background spectra is observed. The results are used to set cross-section upper limits at 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Model-independent limits on Gaussian-shaped signals are also reported. The analysis looking at jets containing b-hadrons benefits from improvements in the jet flavour identification at high transverse momentum, which increases its sensitivity relative to the previous analysis beyond that expected from the higher integrated luminosity.",

Such heavy particles could be produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and then decay into quarks and gluons, creating two energetic jets in the detector. In the SM, dijet events are produced mainly by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. QCD predicts dijet events with a smoothly decreasing invariant mass distribution, m jj . A new particle decaying into quarks or gluons would emerge instead as a resonance in the m jj spectrum.",

The mediator Z mass ranges from 1 TeV to 7 TeV, and the coupling to SM quarks (g q ) varies from 0.1 to 0.5. In this scenario, the Z does not decay into the DM candidate and so the dijet signal depends only upon the coupling to quarks and the mass of the Z resonance.

            "text": "Jets containing a b-hadron are identified using a deep-learning neural network, DL1r, for the first time at ATLAS. The DL1r b-tagging is based on distinctive features of b-hadrons in terms of the impact parameters of tracks and the displaced vertices reconstructed in the inner detector. The inputs of the DL1r network also include discriminating variables constructed by a recurrent neural network (RNNIP) [58], which exploits the spatial and kinematic correlations between tracks originating from the same b-hadron. This approach is found chiefly to improve the performance for jets with high p T [59]. Operating points are defined by a single cut-value on the discriminant output distribution and are chosen to provide a specific b-jet efficiency for an inclusive tt MC sample. A 77% efficiency b-tagging operating point is adopted, which gives maximal overall signal sensitivity across the various signal models and masses considered in the b-tagged categories. The b-tagging performance has a strong dependence on the jet p T : the efficiency drops from 65% for a b-jet p T of around 500 GeV to 10% for a p T of around 2 TeV. Estimated from MC simulation, the corresponding mis-tag rate of charm jets drops from 15% to 2% over the same p T interval, and that of light-flavour jets remains at the level of 1%. Simulation-to-data scale factors are applied to the simulated event samples to compensate for differences in the b-tagging efficiency between data and simulation. These scale factors are measured as a function of jet p T using a likelihood-based method in a sample highly enriched in tt events [60]. Given that the number of b-jets in data is limited for jet p T > 400 GeV, additional uncertainties are assessed by varying in the simulation the underlying quantities that are known to affect the b-tagging performance. The differences between the b-tagging efficiency after each variation and the nominal b-tagging efficiency are then used to construct an extrapolation uncertainty to extend the validity of the correction factors into the higher jet-p T range used in this analysis. The simulation-to-data scale factor as a function of jet p T for the JHEP03(2020)145  Figure 1. Simulation-to-data scale factor as a function of jet p T for the 77% operating point of the DL1r b-tagging algorithm. The scale factors are measured with a likelihood-based method in a sample highly enriched in tt events using 2015-2017 data, as described in ref. [60], with uncertainties due to the limited size of data sample, detector calibration and physics modelling. An additional uncertainty is included to extrapolate the measured uncertainties to the high-p T region of interest (p T > 400 GeV), and has contributions related to the reconstruction of tracks and jets, the modelling of the b-hadrons and the interaction of long-lived b-hadrons with the detector material.",

The signal dijet events are produced through s-channel processes, which favour small |y * |, while a large fraction of the background events are from QCD t-channel processes and have large |y * |. The |y * | cut values are optimised for various categories and signals. In the inclusive selection, |y * | < 0.6 is required for the considered signals, except W * . Due to the fact that a larger |y * | is favoured in the W * decays, a looser requirement |y * | < 1.2 is adopted in the search for W * signals. In the b-tagged categories, where the two leading jets have |\u03b7| < 2.0, a selection |y * | < 0.8 is made. A lower bound on the dijet invariant mass m jj is required to ensure a fully efficient selection without any kinematic bias; it is determined by the single-jet trigger's efficiency turn-on and also depends on the |y * | requirement, as shown in table 1. Within the acceptance of the m jj and |y * | selections, the leading jet's p T is above the single-jet trigger's threshold. For the inclusive selection, the acceptance of QBH and q * signals is around 55% for all the masses considered, while that of W and Z ranges from approximately 20% to 45%, depending on the resonance mass.

In these CRs the signal leakage is expected to be small, and this is confirmed by the MC simulation. In the CRs with the |y * | < 0.8 requirement reversed, per-event fractions passing b-tagging selections are derived as functions of p T and \u03b7 of the two leading jets for both the 1b and 2b categories, which fully take into account the correlations between the leading and subleading jets.

The fitting quality is assessed via the BumpHunter p-value. In a good fit, any localised excess is expected to arise from fluctuations in the fitted background distribution. In determining the window size of the sliding-window fit, a fit is accepted if the corresponding BumpHunter p-value is greater than 0.01. Figure 3 shows the observed m jj distributions for the various categories. The bin widths for each category are chosen to approximate the m jj resolution, which broadens with increasing m jj mass. Predictions for benchmark signals are scaled to larger cross-sections, from 10 to 1000 times their expected values, for display purposes. The vertical lines indicate the most discrepant interval identified by the BumpHunter test. No significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed in the data spectra. In the inclusive category, the BumpHunter p-values of the most discrepant regions are 0.89 for dijet events with |y * | < 0.6 and 0.88 for events with |y * | < 1.  ",

For the 1b and 2b categories, the upper limits are set on the signal cross-section times acceptance times b-tagging selection efficiency times branching ratio. The expected limits are calculated with the asymptotic approximation to the test statistic's distribution [66] and using pseudo-experiments generated according to the values of the background uncertainties from the maximum-likelihood fit. Pseudo-experiments are employed for the interpretation of the signals populating the high-mass part of the spectra where the relative deviation from the asymptotic approximation is found to be more than 1%. The calculated limits are logarithmically interpolated. No uncertainty is applied to the signal theoretical cross-sections. The systematic uncertainties of the background and signal samples are incorporated into the limits by varying all the uncertainty sources according to Gaussian probability distributions.

For example, excited quarks q * with masses below 6.7 TeV are excluded at 95% CL. For the SSM Z model, Z masses below 2.7 TeV are excluded at 95% CL. The analysis with b-tagging benefits from substantial improvements in the b-jet identification algorithm at high transverse momentum, resulting in an improvement in sensitivity beyond that expected from the integrated luminosity increase.",
