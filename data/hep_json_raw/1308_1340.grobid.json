The measurement is performed in seven bins of \u00fe \u00c0 invariant mass squared in the range 0:05 < q 2 < 22:00 GeV 2 =c 4 , excluding the J=c and c \u00f02S\u00de resonance regions. Production and detection asymmetries are corrected for using the B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe decay as a control mode. Averaged over all the bins, the CP asymmetry is found to be A CP \u00bc 0:000 AE 0:033 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:005 \u00f0syst\u00de AE 0:007 (J=c K), where the third uncertainty is due to the CP asymmetry of the control mode. This is consistent with the standard model prediction.",

Physics processes beyond the SM that may enter via the loop and box diagrams could have large effects on observables of the decay.

The detection asymmetry has two components: one due to the different interactions of positive and negative kaons with the detector material, and a left-right asymmetry due to particles of different charges being deflected to opposite sides of the detector by the magnet. The component of the detection asymmetry from muon reconstruction is small and neglected. Since the LHCb experiment reverses the magnetic field, about half of the data used in the analysis is taken with each polarity. Therefore, an average of the measurements with the two polarities is used to suppress significantly the second effect. To account for both the detection and production asymmetries, the decay B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe is used, which has the same final-state particles as B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 and very similar kinematic properties. The CP asymmetry in B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe decays has been measured as \u00f01 AE 7\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c03 [20,21]. Neglecting the difference in the final-state kinematic properties of the kaon, the production and detection asymmetries are the same for both modes, and the value of the CP asymmetry can be obtained via",

To measure any variation in A CP as a function of q 2 , which improves the sensitivity of the measurement to physics beyond the SM, the B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 data set is divided into the seven q 2 bins used in Ref. [1]. The measurement is also made in a bin of 1 < q 2 < 6 GeV 2 =c 4 , which is of particular theoretical interest. To determine the number of B \u00fe decays in each bin, a simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the invariant mass distributions of the B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 and B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe candidates in the range 5:10 < m K < 5:60 GeV=c 2 .

For the B \u00fe !K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 distribution, these decays are fitted by an ARGUS function [23] convolved with a Gaussian function to account for detector resolution. For the B \u00fe !J=c K \u00fe decays, the partially reconstructed background is modeled by another Cruijff function. The shapes of the peaking backgrounds, due to B \u00fe !
