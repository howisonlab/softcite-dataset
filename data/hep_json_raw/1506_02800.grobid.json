With the start of the LHC in 2009, an unprecedented wealth of measurements of the top quark's production mechanisms and properties have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, most of these resulting in smaller uncertainties than those achieved previously. At the same time, huge progress was made on the theoretical side yielding significantly improved predictions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. Due to the vast amount of events containing top quarks, a variety of new measurements became feasible and opened a new window to precisions tests of the Standard Model and to contributions of new physics. In this review, originally written for a recent book on the results of LHC Run 1 [1], top-quark measurements obtained so far from the LHC Run 1 are summarised and put in context with the current understanding of the Standard Model.",

After a two-decade long period of searches at various colliders and experiments, the top quark was finally discovered in 1995 by the CDF and D\u00d8 experiments at Fermilab's Tevatron, a protonantiproton collider, operated at the time at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.80 TeV [3,4]. Since then, and in particular after the upgrade of the Tevatron to a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, pioneering precision measurements were performed at this machine. Prime examples are the measurements of the total cross section for single-top and top-quark pair (tt) production and the measurements of the topquark mass (see Refs. [5,6] and references therein). Currently, both CDF and D\u00d8 are in the process of publishing their legacy measurements based on data sets corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 10 fb \u22121 collected by each experiment during Tevatron Run 2-and these measurements set a standard for the LHC.",

At the LHC, top quarks are produced abundantly due to the high centre-of-mass energy, the resulting large rise of the parton luminosities, and the large instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator. During LHC's Run 1 more than 5 million top-quark events were produced at the collision points in ATLAS and CMS each. Based on these huge data samples, most of the measurements performed at the Tevatron have already been improved and/or complementary studies have been performed. This has only been made possible by inheriting a wealth of analysis techniques from the Tevatron experiments where they were pioneered and brought to perfection. At the LHC, top quarks have become tools for searches for new physics, e.g. the search for rare decays, for measurements of top-quark couplings to gauge bosons, or for the investigation of the proton structure.",

These results do not only impact on our understanding of the Standard Model, but also help us prepare for future investigations at the LHC and beyond.

The factorisation scale \u00b5 F denotes the scale at which, in higher-order calculations, the initialstate singularities are factorised into the parton distribution functions.

The coupling constant \u03b1 s is evaluated at the renormalisation scale \u00b5 R . Note that in higher order, the partonic cross section d\u03c3 also depends on the factorisation scale \u00b5 F such that the factorisation scale dependence of the parton distribution functions is cancelled order by order and the hadronic cross section becomes independent of the non-physical scale \u00b5 F at fixed order in perturbation theory. For more details we refer to Chap. 5 of Ref. [1]. Because the QCD coupling constant is not small (\u03b1 s \u2248 0.1), higher-order corrections can give sizeable contributions and need to be taken into account in most cases. Since the top-quark mass sets a large energy scale, non-perturbative effects are essentially cut off and QCD perturbation theory is believed to give reliable predictions. The next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections for tt production were calculated a long time ago [7,8]. Further improvements were obtained by resumming soft-gluon corrections, which lead to a logarithmic enhancement of the cross section, to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy [9][10][11]. Soft-gluon resummation has been extended recently to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy [12][13][14][15][16]. Despite the fact that top quarks do not form bound states (because of their short lifetime), binding effects still lead to minor corrections of the cross section close to the tt-pair production threshold. In principle, such a would-be bound state could be observed as a narrow peak in the tt invariant-mass spectrum, just below the production threshold. However, the energy resolution of the LHC experiments is not sufficient to resolve this effect. 1 The corresponding corrections to the inclusive cross section are small and have been studied in detail [16][17][18]. Electroweak corrections have also been investigated [19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. For the inclusive cross section of tt production at the LHC operating at 14 TeV, they are negative and at the percent level.",

The first uncertainty is due to the residual 2 scale dependence which is used as an estimate of the unknown higher-order contributions. It has been determined by a variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the range m t /2 . . . 2m t . The second uncertainty is due to the incomplete knowledge of the parton distribution functions. From equation (2) we conclude that the total cross section is known with a precision better than 5%. Moving to higher collider energies will slightly improve the PDF uncertainties since less weight is put to the large x region where the PDFs are less precisely known. So far, only very few NNLO results exist for differential distributions. Most predictions are currently restricted to NLO accuracy (extended in some cases by the resummation of soft-gluon corrections). Fixedorder NLO corrections are available, for example, through the parton-level Monte Carlo (MC) program Mcfm [28]. Combining parton-level NLO calculations with parton-shower simulations is in general not straight forward. A naive combination would count real emission processes twice, since real emission is simulated through the parton shower, but, on the other hand, is also explicitly taken into account in the real-emission processes contributing at NLO. A consistent matching that avoids double-counting has been developed in the past [29,30]. Differential distributions for top-quark pair production at NLO including parton shower effects are given in [31,32].",

[33]). Obviously, the naive expectation can only be true if the observable under consideration is not directly related to off-shell effects. A counter-example is the invariant-mass distribution of the top-quark decay products. Off-shell effects for tt production have been investigated in detail in Refs.

With this wealth of data, top-quark physics entered a completely new realm of precision and detail. With the 2011 data samples, measurements of the inclusive top-quark pair cross section were performed in all decay channels of the tt system (except the one with two \u03c4 leptons in the final state), reaching an unprecedented level of statistical and systematic precision [44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54].   In the limit of large statistics, the most precise measurements of the inclusive tt cross section can be obtained in the e-\u00b5 channel, as the backgrounds and associated uncertainties are minimal. The first published measurement of the top-pair cross section at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV was performed by CMS [55]. It makes use of the decay channel of top-quark pairs with two opposite-charge leptons, one electron and one muon, in the final state. In this channel, backgrounds from non-top-quark events are minimal. Dominant contributions arise from Drell-Yan processes with two \u03c4 leptons in the final state that both decay into a lepton. These backgrounds are suppressed by requiring at least one of the two jets to be b-tagged. Smaller background contributions come from single top-quark production (see section 6) and from top-quark events in other decay channels where one of the jets is misidentified as a lepton. In figure 2 the distributions of the b-tag multiplicity and the missing transverse momentum after the final event selection are shown. The final result of this measurement is \u03c3 tt ( \u221a s = 8 TeV) = 239.0 \u00b1 2.1 (stat) \u00b1 11.3 (syst) \u00b1 6.2 (lumi) pb , in good agreement with the NNLO prediction quoted in equation (2).",

The cross sections for centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV are measured to be \u03c3 tt ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) = 182.9 \u00b1 3.1 (stat) \u00b1 4.2 (syst) \u00b1 3.6 (lumi) \u00b1 3.3 (beam) pb , and \u03c3 tt ( \u221a s = 8 TeV) = 242.4 \u00b1 1.7 (stat) \u00b1 5.5 (syst) \u00b1 7.5 (lumi) \u00b1 4.2 (beam) pb , respectively, where the latter uncertainty is due to the beam-energy uncertainty.",

In figure 4 the distributions of the invariant mass and of the transverse momentum of the top-quark pair system as measured by ATLAS are displayed [57]. The data are very well described by the various calculations up to an energy scale of about 1 TeV. The results from CMS agree with these findings [58]. The transverse momentum and rapidity distribution of each of the top quarks were also measured and the results from CMS are presented in figure 5. Different theoretical predictions are confronted with the data, and they are generally found to give a good description of the data. However, most Monte Carlo simulations predict the transverse momentum distribution of the top quarks to be somewhat harder than what is seen in the data. This discrepancy between data and simulation is presently under investigation. For the time being it constitutes an important source of uncertainty for many analyses.  ",

            "text": "At LHC energies, a large fraction of top-quark pairs is accompanied by additional high-p T jets. Demanding, for example, a minimal transverse momentum of 50 GeV for such additional jets, about 30% of all top-quark pairs are produced together with at least one further jet [60]. From an experimental point of view, the jet activity needs to be understood since the appearance of additional jets affects the event reconstruction. Owing to the large rate, tt production with jets may also lead to sizeable backgrounds for other SM studies or searches for new physics. As an example, tt + 1-jet + X production is the dominant background for Higgs production via vector-boson fusion. From a theoretical perspective, the additional jet activity can be used for further tests of the underlying production and decay mechanisms. Anomalous ttg couplings can be constrained, for example, through a detailed analysis of the process pp \u2192 tt + 1-jet + X. Assuming the validity of our theoretical understanding, tt production in association with a jet can also be used to measure the top-quark mass [61]. Since the process pp \u2192 tt + 1-jet + X is proportional to \u03b1 3 s , NLO contributions can easily give corrections of the order of 30%. For a precise understanding it is thus mandatory to take these corrections into account. In Born approximation, the partonic processes gg \u2192 ttg, qq \u2192 ttg, qg \u2192 ttq and gq \u2192 ttq contribute to tt production in association with a jet. The last three processes are related by crossing. The leading-order partonic matrix elements can be calculated e.g. with the help of MadGraph [62]. The hadronic cross sections are then calculable through a numerical Monte Carlo integration, using again equation (1). For the evaluation of the NLO corrections, the one-loop corrections to the aforementioned Born processes, together with real-emission processes, need to be evaluated. Since the two contributions are individually infrared (IR) divergentthe divergences cancel only in the sum-a method to organise this cancellation needs to be applied. In Refs. [60,63], the one-loop amplitudes have been calculated using a traditional tensor reduction for the one-loop integrals. The cancellation of the IR divergences is achieved using the Catani-Seymour subtraction method [64,65]. In Ref. [66], an alternative calculation of the NLO corrections, based on the unitarity method, has been presented. In a subsequent study [67], also the on-shell decay of the top quark has been taken into account. NLO results for tt production in association with a photon are also available at NLO QCD [68], since this process is closely related to tt production in association with jets. In figure 6(a), the cross section for tt + 1-jet + X production is shown as a function of the renormalisation scale \u00b5 R which is set equal to the factorisation scale. For the parton distribution functions the CTEQ6 set [69] has been used.  The transverse momentum of the additional jet is required to be at least 20 GeV. The leading-order result strongly depends on the renormalisation scale \u00b5 R , a fact that directly reflects the running of the coupling constant \u03b1 s (\u00b5 R ). The Born approximation can thus at best be considered as a rough estimate of the cross section. The NLO corrections as a function of the renormalisation scale, however, show a flat behaviour around \u00b5 R = m t . This may be considered as an indication that m t provides a natural scale for this process. It can also be seen from figure 6(a) that the corrections are rather small for \u00b5 R = m t . Similar observations can be made in figure 6(b) where the rapidity distribution of the additional jet, calculated at NLO, is shown. In Refs. [60, 68] a large variety of differential distributions have been investigated. In particular the transverse momentum distribution of the top quark, the tt system and the additional jet have been calculated. It turns out that for large transverse momentum p T , significant QCD corrections together with a large scale uncertainty are observed. In principle, this is not surprising since at a large transverse momentum an additional scale-different from m t -is introduced. It is conceivable that a phase-space-dependent renormalisation scale could improve the behaviour of the perturbation theory by effectively resumming large logarithmic corrections. In table 1, the dependence of the cross section on the required minimal transverse momentum of the additional jet, p cut T , is shown. A strong dependence on p cut T is found. For p cut T \u2192 0 the cross section diverges logarithmically (the divergence cancels a similar divergence in the cross section for inclusive tt production at NNLO, when tt + 1-jet + X production is combined with the two-loop corrections to inclusive tt production). With the exception of p cut T = 20 GeV, where very small and negative corrections are observed, the corrections are positive and typically about 15-20%.",

            "text": "The ATLAS and CMS collaborations studied the distributions of jet multiplicities and additional jets due to QCD radiation in detail [76][77][78]. The multiplicity distributions of jets for tt events in the single-lepton channel as measured by the CMS collaboration is shown in figure 7. The data are generally well described by the Monte Carlo predictions obtained using MadGraph, Powheg and MC@NLO. Towards very large multiplicities, the MC@NLO generator interfaced with parton showers from Herwig predicts significantly less events than MadGraph or Powheg, which both use Pythia to generate the parton showers. An alternative way of investigating additional activity in tt events is to study \"gap-fraction\" distributions [76,77]. In these studies, events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a given threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto, the gap fraction, is presented as a function of the threshold. The gap-fraction distributions for jets as measured by ATLAS are displayed in figure 8. A qualitatively similar trend is observed as in the multiplicity distribution (figure 7) in that the MC@NLO generator predicts a larger fraction of events that have no jet activity beyond the jets originating directly from the top-quark decays. However, vetoing jets just in the forward region, at rapidities |y| > 1.5, all simulations predict a smaller fraction of events with no additional jet than is seen in the data. These results can be used to improve the choice of models, scale parameters and tunes in Monte Carlo simulations for an optimal description of the data.  Building up on the insights about inclusive distributions of additional jets in top-quark pair events, both ATLAS and CMS have also been studying distributions and rates of events with additional jets originating from heavy quarks. These form an important background to events in which Higgs bosons are produced in association with top-quark pairs, with subsequent decay of the Higgs boson into bb or cc pairs, see Chap. 6 of Ref. [1]. The ATLAS experiment published a measurement of top-quark pairs together with heavy-flavour quarks, tt + b + X or tt + c + X at \u221a s = 7 TeV [79]. The separation between heavyflavour and light-flavour contents of additional jets is achieved by a fit to the vertex-mass distribution of b-tagged jets, shown in figure 9. From the fit, the relative contribution of heavy quarks is extracted to be R HF = [6.2 \u00b1 1.1(stat) \u00b1 1.8(syst)]%, consistent within uncertainties with leading-order expectations, see Ref.

The only free parameters in top-quark physics are thus the three corresponding CKM matrix elements and the top-quark mass, m t . Instead of the top-quark mass, one may also use the Yukawa coupling \u03bb t to the Higgs boson as a free parameter since the two are related by m t = v/ \u221a 2\u03bb t , where v is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. Once the CKM matrix elements and the top-quark mass are known, the SM makes testable predictions for all top-quark properties. Precise measurements of these properties can thus be used to test the consistency of the SM. A prominent example is provided by the simultaneous measurements of the top-quark mass, the W -boson mass and the mass of the Higgs boson since these three masses are related in the SM: The W -boson mass can be calculated as a function of the top-quark mass and the mass of the Higgs boson. A comparison with the measured values thus allows the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking predicted by the SM to be indirectly tested. This is demonstrated in figure 10 where, for comparison, also results within the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM, see e.g. Chap. 10 of Ref. [1]) are shown [80].",

Through quantum corrections, the top quark influences the effective Higgs potential that vertex mass [GeV] jets / 1.00 GeV is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. In principle, it is conceivable that these quantum corrections modify the effective potential such that it develops a second minimum or even becomes unbounded from below. As a consequence, the electroweak vacuum might become metastable or even unstable. Calculating the corresponding lifetime of the vacuum and comparing it with the age of the universe provides a further consistency test of the SM. Experimentally, in most measurements, the mass of the top quark is determined through the reconstruction of the top quark's decay products. The top-quark mass can be estimated by comparing the measured values with the value of the mass parameter used in the simulation. Measurements employing this approach generally achieve the most precise results.",

The reconstructed masses of the two W bosons are constrained in the fit to 80.4 GeV. The reconstructed invariant-mass distribution is shown in figure 12. Events can enter the distributions with different parton-jet assignments (permutations). For simulated tt events, the parton-jet assignments can be classified as correct, wrong and unmatched permutations where, in the latter, at least one quark from the tt decay is not matched to any of the four selected jets. The actual top-quark mass value is determined simultaneously with the jet energy scale using a joint likelihood fit. The joint likelihood is constructed based on the \"ideogram method\" in which the likelihood for each event is evaluated from analytic expressions obtained from simulated events. Biases arising due to this method are determined using pseudo-experiments and corrections are applied accordingly. The dominant uncertainty of the final result comes from the uncertainty of the difference in the jet energy responses for jets originating from light (u, d, s) or bottom quarks, as well as from statistical uncertainties in the determination of differences between different models for colour-reconnection processes. The final result is m t = 173.49 \u00b1 0.43 (stat+JES) \u00b1 0.98 (syst) GeV , corresponding to an optimal jet energy scale correction of 0.994 \u00b1 0.003 (stat) \u00b1 0.008 (syst) with respect to the CMS calibration.",

It depends on the latter quantity because the amount of initial-state and finale-state radiation changes with increasing transverse momentum.

The lepton charge asymmetry is also calculated as a function of the same three kinematic variables as for the single-lepton analysis. No deviations between the measurements and the predictions are found. The charge asymmetry in tt production is predicted to cause a small effect on a variety of observables at the LHC. None of the measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are in conflict with the SM predictions while the current experimental precision is of the order of the size of the prediction itself. Although a variety of models of physics beyond the Standard Model can be excluded with the set of measurements already performed, the analysis of the 8 TeV data (which was not finished at the time of publication) will provide further sensitivity to the predictions of perturbative QCD. It should be noted, that the interpretation of the leptonic charge asymmetries relies on a solid understanding of top-quark production and decay. In particular, a non-standard top-quark polarisation could affect the leptonic asymmetries. It is thus important to cross check the polarisation through explicit measurements.",

Measurements of such quantities are only feasible because of the extremely short lifetime of the top quark of \u03c4 t \u2248 1.5 \u2022 10 -25 s. The lifetime is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the time scale at which hadronisation takes place, \u03c4 had \u2248 1/\u039b QCD \u2248 3 \u2022 10 -24 s, and in particular shorter than the time needed to decorrelate the spin configuration of the tt pair, \u03c4 decorr \u2248h mt \u039b 2 QCD \u2248 3 \u2022 10 -21 s [111,112]. Top quarks will thus decay before they can form bound states. As mentioned before, the large top-quark width cuts off non-perturbative effects. The polarisation of the top-quark is thus not diluted by hadronisation effects and can be calculated reliably within perturbation theory. The parity-violating weak decay can then be used to analyse the top-quark polarisation through the angular distribution of the decay products. The correlation of the top-quark and antiquark spins is reflected in the angular correlation of the topquark and antiquark decay products. This is a unique feature since all lighter quarks form hadrons for which-due to the hadronisation process-the initial spin information of the mother particle is diluted or even entirely lost. In contrast, the spin information of the top quark is directly transferred to its decay products.",

The spin-analysing power quantifies the amount of spin information transferred to the daughter particle and depends on the particle type. It is approximately one for charged leptons and down-type quarks from the subsequent decay of the W boson [113]. The coefficient A is a measure of the spin correlation between top quark and antiquark. As the strong interaction conserves parity, the polarisation of top (anti)quarks in tt production within the production plane is expected to be zero. QCD absorptive parts, sometimes also called final-state interactions 3 , introduce a tiny transverse polarisation at the one-loop level [114,115]. Electroweak corrections lead to a small amount of net polarisation of \u03b1 i P i = 0.003 \u00b1 0.001 [116].

While for measurements at the Tevatron the \"off-diagonal basis\" and the \"beam basis\" are suitable choices, measurements at the LHC are most sensitive to the correlation coefficient in the \"helicity basis\". In the beam basis, the direction of the beam is used as reference axis for the top-quark as well as for the antiquark. In the helicity basis, the direction of flight of the top-quark/antiquark is used as respective reference axis. The strength of the correlation predicted by the SM using the helicity basis is A = 0.031 [117] with an uncertainty of approximately 1%. Close to the threshold, top-quark pairs produced via gluon fusion are in a 1 S 0 state while top-quark pairs produced via quark-antiquark annihilation are in a 3 S 1 state. As a consequence, the spins of a topquark pair produced in quark-antiquark annihilation tend to be parallel while in gluon fusion they tend to be antiparallel. A measurement of the coefficient A is thus a direct probe of the production mechanism. Contributions from additional production mechanisms, e.g. yet unknown intermediate vector bosons, can lead to altered predictions for A. Note that the correlation coefficient depends both on the centre-of-mass energy and on the initial-state particles, and so the measurements conducted at the Tevatron and the LHC are complementary.",

The measurement is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb \u22121 recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Events consistent with the signature of tt events decaying in the dilepton mode are selected, and the spin correlation is probed using the difference in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons, \u2206\u03c6, calculated in the laboratory frame. The advantage of this observable compared to those in equation (4) is that no kinematic reconstruction of the top-quark momenta is necessary while the sensitivity to the correlation strength is largely retained [112]. Figure 17(a) shows the observed \u2206\u03c6 spectrum as well as the predictions for the assumption of SM correlations and the absence of correlations. The measured correlation coefficient is not compatible with zero, A = 0.40 \u00b1 0.04 (stat) +0.08 \u22120.07 (syst) , with a significance of 5.1 standard deviations. The dominating sources of systematic uncertainty are the estimate of events with misidentified leptons and the jet reconstruction.

The two largest systematic uncertainties are uncertainties on the top-quark mass and on the jet reconstruction.

The data were collected at \u221a s = 7 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.66 \u00b1 0.08 fb \u22121 . The full tt system is reconstructed using a kinematic likelihood [104] in the single-lepton channel and the neutrino-weighting method [123] in the dilepton channel. The angle \u03b8 \u00b1 is calculated in the helicity basis for each lepton, and the corresponding distributions are fitted with templates of partially polarised top quarks. The spin correlation is assumed to be that of the SM. The fits are done separately for each lepton type as well as for positively and negatively charged leptons. The latter is done in order to distinguish scenarios in which the polarisation comes from CP -conserving processes and maximally CP -violating processes. For such cases, the expressions \u03b1 P are either the same for top quark and antiquark, or they differ by a sign. Figure 18 shows the distributions of cos(\u03b8 \u00b1 ) measured in single-lepton events for the two scenarios.

In both cases, the reconstruction of the top quarks is based on the final-state particles and assumptions on the detector performance. For both event types, an individual analysis strategy is followed. While the first strategy is based on a template fit of the cos(\u03b8 * ) distributions, the second makes use of the angular asymmetries derived from unfolded cos(\u03b8 * ) spectra. The individual results are all found to be in agreement and are combined using the BLUE method [129].

Due to phase-space suppression and the small gluon luminosity, this channel gives only a tiny contribution at the Tevatron. In contrast, s-channel production, which is roughly responsible for one third of the cross section at the Tevatron, leads only to a contribution of a few percent at the LHC. Single top-quark production at the LHC is thus to some extent complementary to that at the Tevatron. A further major difference arises from the fact that the initial state at the Tevatron is a CP eigenstate. Since CP -violating effects are negligible in single top-quark production within the SM, the numbers of produced single top quarks and antiquarks are identical at the Tevatron. At the LHC, however, the initial state is not a CP eigenstate, and more top quarks than antiquarks are produced because in pp collisions the flux of up-type quarks is larger than the flux for down-type quarks.",

However, as has been pointed out before, this channel gives only a small contribution at the LHC. Since at NLO, no colour transfer between the two quark lines is allowed (the corresponding box contributions vanish after interference with the Born amplitude), it is conceivable that the small corrections are accidental and that the small scale uncertainty observed at NLO underestimates the possible size of the NNLO corrections. Very recently, the vertex corrections for the t-channel have been calculated at NNLO QCD [145]. The corrections are found to be comparable in size to the NLO corrections.",

In contrast to tt production, singly-produced top quarks are highly polarised-a consequence of their V -A coupling to the W boson. The measurement of the top-quark polarisation thus provides a further test of the V -A structure of the tW b vertex. Assuming that the production mechanism is well understood, t-channel single top-quark production can also be used to constrain the b parton distribution in the proton. Furthermore, it can be used for a direct measurement of the CKM matrix element V tb which is otherwise only indirectly accessible, via the assumptions of CKM matrix unitarity and of the existence of only three quark families.",

Events with two or three jets are selected. To separate t-channel single top-quark signal events from backgrounds, several kinematic variables are combined into one discriminant by employing a neural network that also exploits correlations between the variables. The most discriminating variable for the two-jet sample is the invariant mass of the system formed by the b-tagged jet, the charged lepton and the neutrino, m \u03bdb , see figure 22(a). In the three-jet category, the invariant mass of the two leading jets and the absolute value of the difference in pseudo-rapidity of the leading and the lowest-p T jet are among the most discriminating variables. Multi-jet event yields are determined with data-driven techniques, while contributions from W +jets events are derived from simulation and normalised to data in control regions using a cut-based analysis. All other backgrounds and the t-channel signal expectation are normalised to theoretical cross sections. To extract the signal content of the selected sample, a maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the output distributions of the neural net in the two-jet and three-jet data sets. From a simultaneous measurement in the two channels, a cross section of . The event sample is selected by the application of simple criteria: The events must contain exactly one muon or electron with large transverse momentum. They are categorised according to the numbers of jets and b-tagged jets, and the category enriched with t-channel signal is the one with two jets and one tag. One of the jets, denoted by j , is expected to not originate from b quarks, and its pseudorapidity distribution is typical of the t-channel processes where a light parton recoils against a much more feature is used to distinguish the signal from background. Background events from tt and from W +jets processes are determined by the use of control categories. In all categories the invariant mass m \u03bdb is used to define a signal region and a side-band region that contain events inside and outside the reconstructed top-quark mass window of 130 < m \u03bdb < 220 GeV, respectively. To determine the contribution from signal events, a binned maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the |\u03b7 j | distribution of the events in the signal region of the category with two jets and one tag. In figure 23 (a) the m \u03bdb distribution is shown for events with forward jets. The figure illustrates that large-purity samples of t-channel single-top quark events can be isolated at the LHC using simple selection criteria. The measured cross section for this process is \u03c3 t+t = 83.6 \u00b1 2.3 (stat) \u00b1 7.4 (syst) pb .",

The ATLAS analysis makes use of dileptonic final states with events featuring two isolated leptons (electron or muon) with significant transverse missing momentum and at least one jet. A boosted decision tree (BDT) is used to discriminate single top-quark tW events from background events, which mostly arise from top-quark pair production.

On the theoretical side, a major breakthrough has been made with the calculation of the NNLO QCD corrections for inclusive production of top-quark pairs. Very recently, the theoretical calculations have been extended to include also predictions for differential distributions. The NNLO QCD corrections have been further improved by including weak corrections, the resummation of logarithmically enhanced contributions due to soft-gluon emission, and bound-state effects. In addition, finite-width effects have been studied in ground-breaking calculations by studying the one-loop QCD corrections including the decay of the top quark. For the experimental analysis, NLO predictions matched and merged to take into account parton-shower corrections and predictions for larger jet multiplicities are available. For single-top-quark production, NLO QCD corrections are known including also the decay of the top quark. For t-channel production, the theoretical predictions have been extended recently to include also partial results at NNLO QCD. In addition, conceptual differences using four or five flavours in the initial state have been studied in detail. For many observables the theoretical uncertainties are at the level of ten percent, and in some cases even the level of a few percent is reached. Beyond the steadily improving quality of theoretical predictions, a variety of new observables that allow precise tests of the underlying theory have been proposed. New methods to measure the top-quark mass are currently under development.",

Substantial effort is being invested to reduce these uncertainties, through auxiliary measurements, through tuning of Monte Carlo generators and through further improvements of the theoretical calculations.
