            "text": "Studies of particle production and decay under the reversal of discrete symmetries (charge, parity, and time reversal) have yielded considerable insight on the structure of the theories that describe high energy phenomena. Of particular interest is the observation of CP violation, a phenomenon well established in the K 0 and B 0 d systems, but not yet observed for the B 0 s system, where all CP violation effects are expected to be small in the standard model (SM) [1]. (See [2] and references therein for a review of the experimental results and of the theoretical framework for describing CP violation in neutral meson decays.) The violation of CP symmetry is a necessary condition for baryogenesis, the process thought to be responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe [3]. However, the observed CP violation in the K 0 and B 0 d systems, consistent with the standard model expectation, is not sufficient to explain this asymmetry, suggesting the presence of additional sources of CP violation, beyond the standard model [4].",

This difference arises from additional hyperon production channels in K \u00c0 -nucleon reactions, which are absent for their K \u00fe -nucleon analogs. Since the interaction probability of K \u00fe mesons is smaller, they travel farther than K \u00c0 in the detector material, and have a greater chance of decaying to muons, and a larger probability to punchthrough the absorber material thereby mimicking a muon signal.

Figure 2 and Table III give the resulting fractions f K and F K for different p T bins. Only statistical uncertainties are given; systematic uncertainties are discussed in Sec. VIII. The difference in the absolute value and in the p T dependence of f K and F K may be due to a different composition of the inclusive muon and like-sign dimuon samples, and due to the statistical fluctuations. In addition to the fitting procedure discussed in Appendix B, the ratio F K =f K is also measured by an alternative null fit method presented in Appendix E. The agreement between the two methods is very good; therefore we exclude the fitting procedure as the source of difference between f K and F K . ",

Changes are implemented in a variety of tests: (i) Test A: Using only the part of the data sample corresponding to the first 2:8 fb \u00c01 . (ii) Test B: In addition to the reference selections, requiring at least three hits in muon wire chamber layers B or C, and the 2 for a fit to a track segment reconstructed in the muon detector to be less than 8. (iii) Test C: Since the background muons are produced by decays of kaons and pions, their track parameters measured by the central tracker and by the muon system are different. Therefore, the fraction of background strongly depends on the 2 of the difference between these two measurements. The requirement on this 2 is changed from 40 to 4 in this study. (iv) Test D: The maximum value of the transverse impact parameter is changed from 0.3 to 0.05 cm, and the requirement on the longitudinal distance between the point of closest approach to the beam and the associated interaction vertex is changed from 0.5 to 0.05 cm. This test serves also as a cross-check against the possible contamination from muons from cosmic rays in the selected sample. (v) Test E: Using only low-luminosity events with fewer than three interaction vertices. (vi) Test F: Using only events corresponding to two of the four possible configurations of the magnets, for which the solenoid and toroid polarities are identical. (vii) Test G: Changing the requirement on the invariant mass of the two muons from 2.8 to 12 GeV. (viii) Test H: Using the same muon p T requirement, p T > 4:2 GeV, over the full detector acceptance. (ix) Test I: Requiring the muon p T to be <7:0 GeV. (x) Test J: Requiring the azimuthal angle of the muon track to be in the range 0 < < 4 or 5:7 < < 2. This selection excludes muons directed to the region of poor muon identification efficiency in the support structure of the detector.

(xiv) Test N: Requiring the muon to be in the range 0:7 < jj < 2:2. (xv) Test O: Using like-sign dimuon events passing at least one single muon trigger, while ignoring the requirement of a dimuon trigger for these events. (xvi) Test P: Using like-sign dimuon events passing both single muon and dimuon triggers. (xvii) Test Q: Using the events collected when the muon detector is fully operational. A summary of the results from these studies is presented in Tables XV and XVI. The last line, denoted as ''significance,'' gives the difference between the reference result (column Ref.) and each modification, divided by its uncertainty, and taking into account the overlap between the samples. The statistical uncertainties are used in the calculation of the significance of the difference between two results. These tests demonstrate an impressive stability of the A b sl result, and provide a strong confirmation of the validity of the method. As a result of the variations of the selection criteria, all input quantities are changed over a wide range, while the asymmetry A b sl remains well within the assigned uncertainties. For example, the uncorrected asymmetry A changes by a factor % 1:5 in test C, while the asymmetry A b sl changes by less than 7%. It should also be noted that reducing the kaon background in test C yields a negative asymmetry A. Figure 16 shows the observed and expected uncorrected like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. The expected asymmetry is computed using Eq. (13) and all the measurements of the sample composition and of the asymmetries. We compare the expected uncorrected asymmetry using two different assumptions for A b sl . In Fig. 16(a) the observed asymmetry is compared to the expectation for A b sl \u00bc 0, while Fig. 16(b) shows the expected asymmetry for A b sl \u00bc \u00c00:009 57. A possible systematic discrepancy between the observed and expected asymmetries can be observed for A b sl \u00bc 0, while it essentially disappears for the measured A b sl value corresponding to Eq. (67). It can also be seen that the observed asymmetry changes as a function of the dimuon invariant mass, and that the expected asymmetry reproduces this effect when A b sl \u00bc \u00c00:009 57. This dependence of the asymmetry on the invariant mass of the muon pair is a complex function of the production mechanism, of the mass of the particles being produced, and of their decays. The agreement between the observed and expected asymmetries indicates that the physics leading to the observed asymmetry is well described by the contributions from the backgrounds and from decaying b hadrons.",

These terms are significant only because of the large statistics of the inclusive muon sample, which contains about 10 7 entries per bin in Fig. 22. The fit of the K \u00c30 signal in the like-sign dimuon sample is of the same quality without these additional terms. The results do not change significantly if these terms are omitted.

K ! \u00de are obtained by fitting the invariant mass histograms of K \u00c30 ! K ! in the like-sign dimuon and inclusive muon samples, respectively. These fits require precise modeling of the 0 resonance and of other backgrounds. In the first method we use the results listed in Table III and obtain the values of i listed in Table XVII. A second set of values for the i parameters can be obtained by finding a scale factor which minimizes the differences between invariant mass distributions for the K \u00c30 candidates in the inclusive muon and dimuon samples (null fit method). Invariant mass distributions for K \u00c30 candidates analogous to the ones shown in Fig. 22 and 23 are built for each bin of K ! transverse momentum. We scale the invariant mass distribution in the inclusive muon sample by a factor i N i =\u00f02n i \u00de and subtract it from the invariant mass distribution obtained from the dimuon sample. The contributions from the resonance and from other backgrounds cancel to first order in the difference of the two invariant mass distributions, simplifying the convergence of mass fits. We then vary the factor i and find the value that yields a null normalization factor for the residual K \u00c30 signal. The statistical uncertainty on i is obtained by choosing the value of the scale factor which yields a positive (negative) value of this normalization factor which is equal to its uncertainty. The values of i obtained with this method are also listed in Table XVII, with their statistical uncertainties. There is remarkable agreement between the values of i obtained using the two methods.",
