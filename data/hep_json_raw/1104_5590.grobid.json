These are flavor changing neutral current decays, forbidden at tree level in the SM but allowed through electroweak loop processes. The loop can be mediated by non-SM particles (for example, charged Higgs or SUSY particles) and therefore is sensitive to new physics (NP). Here we report the first observation of a new b \u2192 s radiative penguin decay mode, B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 \u03b3, as well as measurements of its time-dependent CP asymmetry. This type of decay is sensitive to NP from righthanded currents [1] and will be useful for precise timedependent measurements at future high-luminosity flavor facilities [2][3][4].",

The expected mixinginduced CP asymmetry parameter (S) is O(3%) and the direct CP asymmetry parameter (A) is \u223c 0.6% [1]. In several extensions of the SM, both photon helicities can contribute to the decay. Therefore, any significantly larger CP asymmetry would be clear evidence for NP. In contrast to B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (\u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 )\u03b3 [5,6], another related mode that is sensitive to NP, the time dependence of B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S \u03b3 can be measured from the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay and does not require a difficult measurement of the long lived K 0 S decay inside the inner tracking volume or reconstruction of a low energy \u03c0 0 . The B \u2192 \u03c6K\u03b3 mode can be used to search for a possible contribution from kaonic resonances decaying to \u03c6K. Furthermore, we can also probe the photon polarization using the angular distributions of the final state hadrons [7].",

We use two event-shape variables (a Fisher discriminant formed from modified Fox-Wolfram moments [16] and the cosine of the angle between the B flight direction and the beam axis, cos \u03b8 B , in the cms frame) to distinguish spherically symmetric BB events from the jet-like continuum background. From these variables we form a likelihood ratio, denoted by R s/b . We require R s/b > 0.65, which removes 91% of the continuum while retaining 76% of the signal. In addition to the continuum, various BB background sources are also studied. In the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S \u03b3 mode, backgrounds from some b \u2192 c decays such as D 0 \u03c0 0 , D 0 \u03b7 and D \u2212 \u03c1 + , peak in the M bc distribution. We remove the dominant peaking backgrounds by applying a veto to \u03c6K 0 S combinations consistent within detector resolution (\u00b14 \u03c3) with the nominal D mass [13]. Some of the charmless backgrounds, where the B meson decays to \u03c6K * (892), \u03c6K\u03c0 0 and \u03c6K\u03b7 also peak in M bc but shift towards lower \u2206E. Another significant background is non-resonant (NR) B \u2192 K + K \u2212 K\u03b3, which peaks in the \u2206E-M bc signal region; it is estimated using the \u03c6 mass sideband, The signal yield is obtained from an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood (UML) fit to the two-dimensional \u2206E-M bc distribution. We model the shape for the signal component using the product of a Crystal Ball line shape [17] for \u2206E and a Gaussian for M bc . The continuum background is represented by the product of a first-order polynomial for \u2206E and an ARGUS [18] function for M bc . The b \u2192 c background is described by the product of a second-order polynomial for \u2206E and the sum of an ARGUS and a Gaussian function for M bc . For the small charmless backgrounds (except for the NR component), we use the sum of two Gaussians for \u2206E and a Gaussian for M bc . The probability density function (PDF) is the product of these two functional forms [19]. In the final fit the continuum parameters are allowed to vary while all other background parameters are fixed to the values from MC simulations. The shapes of the b \u2192 c and NR peaking background components are fixed to that of the signal. In the charged mode, the NR background yield, (12.5 \u00b1 6.7)% of the signal, is fixed from the \u03c6 mass sideband. Since the neutral mode is limited by statistics, we assume isospin symmetry and use the same NR fraction. The signal shapes are adjusted for small differences between MC simulations and data using a B 0 \u2192 K * (892) 0 (\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b3 control sample, with M K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2208 [820, 970] MeV/c 2 . The fit yields a signal of 144 \u00b1 17 B + \u2192 \u03c6K + \u03b3 and 37 \u00b1 8 B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S \u03b3 events. The projections of the fit results onto \u2206E and M bc are shown in Fig. 1. The signal significance is defined as \u22122 ln(L 0 /L max ), where L max is the maximum likelihood for the nominal fit and L 0 is the corresponding value with the signal yield fixed to zero. The additive sources of systematic uncertainty (described below) are included in the significance by varying each by its error and taking the lowest significance. The signal in the charged mode has a significance of 9.6 \u03c3, whereas that for the neutral mode is 5.4 \u03c3. To measure the M \u03c6K distribution, we repeat the fit in bins of \u03c6K mass and the resulting signal yields are corrected for the detection efficiency. Nearly 72% of the signal events are concentrated in the low-mass region, M \u03c6K \u2208 [1.5, 2.0] GeV/c 2 , as shown in Fig. 2. The MC efficiencies are reweighted according to this M \u03c6K depen-dence. These spectra are consistent with the expectations from the pQCD model for non-resonant B \u2192 \u03c6K\u03b3 decays [20]. With the present statistics no clear evidence is found for the existence of a kaonic resonance decaying to \u03c6K.",

The value r = 0 signifies no flavor discrimination while r = 1 implies unambiguous flavor assignment. The data are divided into seven r intervals. The vertex position for the f rec decay is reconstructed using the two kaon tracks from the \u03c6 meson and that of the f tag decay is from well-reconstructed tracks that are not assigned to f rec [22].

The fraction of each component (f j ) depends on the r region and is calculated for each event as a function of \u2206E and M bc . The signal PDF is given by a modified form of Eq. (1) by fixing \u03c4 B 0 and \u2206m d to their world-average values [13] and incorporating the effect of incorrect flavor assignment. The distribution is then convolved with a resolution function to take into account the finite vertex resolution. Since the NR component is expected to have the same NP as the signal B \u2192 \u03c6K\u03b3, we treat this as signal for the time-dependent fit [23]. For the other BB components, we use the same functional forms as signal with an effective lifetime taken from MC and CP parameters fixed to zero. For the continuum background, we use the functional form described in Ref. [22]; the parameters are determined from a fit to the \u2206t distribution of events in the data sideband M bc < 5.26 GeV/c 2 and \u2206E \u2208 [0.1, 0.3] GeV. The term P ol (\u2206t) is a broad Gaussian function that represents an outlier component with a small fraction f ol . The PDFs and resolution functions are described in detail elsewhere [22]. We perform various consistency checks of the CP fitting technique. A lifetime fit to the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b3, B + \u2192 \u03c6K + \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S \u03b3 data sample yields 1.56 \u00b1 0.03 ps, 1.70 \u00b1 0.20 ps and 2.09 \u00b1 0.45 ps, respectively. These are all consistent with the worldaverage values of the B lifetimes. The results of the CP asymmetry fit to the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b3 (S = +0.02 \u00b1 0.06, A = \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.04) and B + \u2192 \u03c6K + \u03b3 (S = +0.25 \u00b1 0.33, A = +0.18 \u00b1 0.26) are consistent with zero. A fit to the sideband events in the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S \u03b3 data sample gives an asymmetry consistent with zero (S = \u22121.77 \u00b1 1.30, A = \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.14).

The uncertainty from physics parameters (\u03c4 B 0 , \u2206m d ), effective lifetime and CP asymmetry of the BB background, is (0.05, 0.03). We also include a possible fit bias due to low statistics and the proximity of the central value to the physical boundary ( +0.00 \u22120.22 , +0. 21 \u22120.00 ). MC simulations show that this bias decreases to 0.04 with twice the signal yield. Adding all these contributions in quadrature, we obtain a systematic error of +0.10 \u22120.24 on S and +0.23 \u22120.10 on A. In summary, we report the first observation of a new radiative decay mode, B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 \u03b3 using a data sample of 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs. The observed signal yield is 37 \u00b1 8 with a significance of 5.4 \u03c3 including systematic uncertainties, and the measured branching fraction is B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 \u03b3) = (2.74 \u00b1 0.60 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10 \u22126 .

The signal events are mostly concentrated at low \u03c6K mass near threshold. The branching fractions and \u03c6K mass spectra are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of Ref. [20].
