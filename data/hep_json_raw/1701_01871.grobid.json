The Standard Model (SM) predicts CP violation to occur in the charm sector, albeit at a level of O 10 \u22123 at leading order in 1/m c , compatible with the lack of evidence in current measurements. Larger values are possible if new sources of CP violation beyond the SM exist. The study of charm systems is a unique tool to probe sources of CP violation that affect only the dynamics of up-type quarks [1].",

            "text": "In order for non-zero CP asymmetries to be observable in a process, two or more interfering amplitudes with different CP-odd and CP-even phases are needed. In the SM, no direct CP violation can therefore emerge at leading order in Cabibbo-favoured charm decays, which are mediated by a single weak amplitude, while small CP asymmetries are expected in singly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays [2] due to the interference of colour-allowed tree-level amplitudes with loop-(penguin) and colour-suppressed tree-level amplitudes. Since these asymmetries may be enhanced by nonperturbative effects [3], theoretical interpretations of experimental results require the analysis of several channels with similar sensitivity. In particular, the study of charm decays to pseudoscalar mesons tests flavour topology [4] and SU(3) predictions, and may constrain amplitudes through triangle relations or shed light on sources of SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking [5][6][7]. To date, the most precise measurements of CP asymmetries in singly-Cabibbosuppressed two-body charm decays have been performed in D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays by the LHCb Collaboration [8,9], and have shown no evidence for CP violation. Among the other charm decays to two pseudoscalar mesons with significant branch-ing fractions, thus far D \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 \u00b1 and D \u00b1 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 \u00b1 have been studied only in e + e \u2212 collisions [10,11] due to the experimental difficulty of reconstructing \u03b7 ( ) mesons in hadron collisions. The most recent studies of these decays at the Belle and CLEO experiments yielded a CP asymmetry of (\u22120.12 \u00b1 1.12 \u00b1 0.17)% [11] for the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed D \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 \u00b1 decay and (\u22122.2 \u00b1",

Uncertainties are statistical only. A shaded band representing the 68.3% confidence intervals obtained from the weighted average over all the samples is shown to guide the eye. The selection of signal and control sample candidates removes the majority of background from non-prompt D \u00b1 (s) mesons, originating from the decay of a b hadron.

The systematic uncertainty due to D \u00b1 s\u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 , D \u00b1 s \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 , and D \u00b1 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c00 is calculated from the estimated fraction of background events, assuming a negligible CP violation and using the production asymmetries in LHCb acceptance as an input. The difference of raw asymmetries in A CP (D \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) is corrected for the K 0 asymmetry [9] and an associated systematic uncertainty equal to the applied correction is included. The potential discrepancy in the bachelor pion kinematic distribution within each p T \u2212 \u03b7 bin between signal and control samples, associated to the finite number of bins, might result in an incomplete cancellation of detection asymmetries. The discrepancy in A CP with respect to the nominal binning, resulting from using no kinematic binning, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The D \u00b1 (s) production asymmetry may show a dependence on p T and \u03b7 of the charm meson. Therefore, the cancellation of production effects in A CP may be partial, since D \u00b1 (s) kinematic distributions are different for signal and control channels. To estimate this effect, in each bin of the bachelor-pion kinematic distribution, the D \u00b1 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 and D \u00b1 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 candidates are given a weight depending on either the p T or the \u03b7 value of the D \u00b1 (s) meson, to reproduce the D \u00b1 (s) kinematic distribution of signal candidates. The effect on A CP is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The A CP results are stable when the requirements on the bachelor-pion particle identification and track quality are tightened, and when the constraints on the parameters of the combinatorial background component are removed from the fit to D \u00b1 (s) \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 \u00b1 candidates. The stability of A CP is also investigated as a function of beam energy and hardware trigger decision. No significant dependence is observed, as shown in Fig. 4.",
