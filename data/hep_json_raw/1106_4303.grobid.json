In addition to the pure number fluctuations, region-to-region correlated background within one event can enhance or deplete locally the level of background and modify the jet energy. We show a first detailed assessment of background effects using different probes embedded into heavy-ion data and quantify their influence on the reconstructed jet spectrum.",

The aim of jet reconstruction is to gain more direct access to the orignal parton properties and the modification of their fragmentation process in heavy-ion collisions than single particle measurements [1,2]. Already the first measurements of reconstructed jets in heavyion collisions at the LHC showed a striking imbalance between back-to-back dijets [3] pointing to a significant partonic energy loss in the medium. However, a quantitative interpretation of any jet result requires a precise knowledge of the background-induced fluctuations of the measured jet signal, which can distort the jet balance even in the absence of any other medium effects [4].",

For this we use tracks reconstructed in the Time-Projection-Chamber (TPC) together with vertexing information from the Inner Tracking System (ITS).

In case of embedding the standard anti-k t algorithm with R = 0.4 is used to cluster the event and the reconstructed jets are matched to the embedded probe, by either finding the single track in it, or 50% of the pp jet momentum (in the case of jet embedding).

The distribution is peaked around zero, illustrating the validity of the background subtraction. We iteratively fit the left-hand-side of each distribution with a Gaussian to obtain a measure for the width of the distribution. The \u03c3 of the Gaussian fit provides the lower limit on the total fluctuations and is larger than 10 GeV/c for all methods. The deviation from the Gaussian shape on the right-hand-side of the distribution is apparent, and is also reflected in the RMS of the full distributions which ranges from 11.4 to 12 GeV/c. It can be explained mainly by the presence of jets in the Pb-Pb events used for embedding, as seen by the shape of the scaled reconstructed jet spectrum. It is also seen in figure 2a), where the \u03b4p t distribution from random cones on full events is compared to random cones with a minimum distance to the leading jets and in events where the tracks have been randomized in \u03b7 and \u03c6. In the latter two cases the tail attributed to jets is much less pronounced and a Gaussian shape is almost recovered. It has to be noted that the distributions due to purely statistical fluctuations are not expected to exactly follow a Gaussian shape, but instead are better described by a \u0393-function [9], since \u03b4p t is similar to a measurement of p t fluctuations in a limited region of phase space. The removal of the jet contribution does not affect the left side of the distribution, it only becomes narrower if all residual correlations are destroyed by randomizing the event, this points to correlated region-to-region fluctuations in addition to the purely statistical.",

Since within the jet we sum over all particle p t the effect scales with v 2 (p t )p t and thus is still sizable in central events.
