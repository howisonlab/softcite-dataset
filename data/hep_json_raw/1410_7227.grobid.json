            "text": "We present a measurement of neutrino oscillations via atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance with three years of data of the completed IceCube neutrino detector. DeepCore, a region of denser IceCube instrumentation, enables the detection and reconstruction of atmospheric muon neutrinos between 10 GeV and 100 GeV, where a strong disappearance signal is expected. The IceCube detector volume surrounding DeepCore is used as a veto region to suppress the atmospheric muon background. Neutrino events are selected where the detected Cherenkov photons of the secondary particles minimally scatter, and the neutrino energy and arrival direction are reconstructed. Both variables are used to obtain the neutrino oscillation parameters from the data, with the best fit given by \u2206m 2 32 = 2.72 +0.19 \u22120.20 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b823 = 0.53 +0.09 \u22120.12 (normal mass ordering assumed). The results are compatible, and comparable in precision, to those of dedicated oscillation experiments.",

This property gives neutrinos produced in one flavor eigenstate, \u03b1, a non-zero probability of interacting in a different flavor, \u03b2, after traveling for some distance L. In the simplest scenario, with only two neutrino flavors, the transition probability is given by",

Considering the existence of three neutrinos, as done in this letter, provides an oscillation probability that consists of a sum of terms of the form of Eq. 1, but involving three mixing angles, two mass-squared differences and a complex phase. Currently, the mixing angles, the solar mass splitting and the absolute value of the atmospheric mass splitting have been measured [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] while the existence of CPviolation and the ordering of the masses remain open questions [11,12]. Addressing these questions requires improving the measurement precision on the known parameters and improving the measurements sensitive to the parameters that modify the oscillation probabilities as neutrinos traverse matter [13][14][15].",

By selecting events above the noise threshold of the search, a sample of atmospheric muons which fulfill the quality criteria, outlined next, is obtained. These events are used to create the template for the muon background at the final selection level.

In the figure, the region where cos \u03b8 z \u2265 0 is also shown, even though it is not used for obtaining the final result. The transition from a muon to neutrino (assuming the best known oscillation parameters) dominated sample as additional selection criteria are applied can be seen in the three steps.
