The measurement covers a phase space up to 2 TeV in jet transverse momentum and 2.5 in absolute jet rapidity. The statistical precision of these data leads to stringent constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton. The data provide important input for the gluon density at high fractions of the proton momentum and for the strong coupling constant at large energy scales. Using predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order, complemented with electroweak corrections, the constraining power of these data is investigated and the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass M Z is determined to be \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1185 \u00b1 0.0019 (exp) +0.0060   \u22120.0037 (theo), which is in agreement with the world average.",

            "text": "Collimated streams of particles, conventionally called jets, are abundantly produced in highly energetic proton-proton collisions at the LHC. At high transverse momenta p T these collisions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using perturbative techniques (pQCD). Indispensable ingredients for QCD predictions of cross sections in pp collisions are the proton structure, expressed in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), and the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , which is a fundamental parameter of QCD. The PDFs and \u03b1 S both depend on the relevant energy scale Q of the scattering process, which is identified with the jet p T for the reactions considered in this report. In addition, the PDFs, defined for each type of parton, depend on the fractional momentum x of the proton carried by the parton. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch The large cross section for jet production at the LHC and the unprecedented experimental precision of the jet measurements allow stringent tests of QCD. In this study, the theory is confronted with data in previously inaccessible phase space regions of Q and x. When jet production cross sections are combined with inclusive data from deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), the gluon PDF for x 0.01 can be constrained and \u03b1 S (M Z ) can be determined. In the present analysis, this is demonstrated by means of the CMS measurement of inclusive jet production [1]. The data, collected in 2011 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 , extend the accessible phase space in jet p T up to 2 TeV, and range up to |y| = 2.5 in absolute jet rapidity. A PDF study using inclusive jet measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration is described in Ref. [2].",

The treatment of correlations uses 16 mutually uncorrelated sources as in Ref. [1]. Within each source, the uncertainties are fully correlated in p T and \u03b7. Any change in the jet energy calibration (JEC) is described through a linear combination of sources, where each source is assumed to have a Gaussian probability density with a zero mean and a root-mean-square of unity.

The absolute scale is a single fixed number such that the corresponding uncertainty is fully correlated across p T and \u03b7. Using photon + jet and Z + jet data, the JES can be constrained directly in the jet p T range 30-600 GeV. The response at larger and smaller p T is extrapolated through MC simulation. Extra uncertainties are assigned to this extrapolation based on the differences between MC event generators and the single-particle response of the detector.

The measurement uncertainties within different detector regions are strongly correlated, and thus the \u03b7-dependent sources are only provided for wide regions: barrel, endcap with upstream tracking, endcap without upstream tracking, and the HF calorimeter. In principle, the \u03b7-dependent effects can also have a p T dependence. Based on systematic studies on data and simulated events, which indicate that the p T and \u03b7 dependence of the uncertainties factorise to a good approximation, this is omitted from the initial calibration procedure. However, experiences with the calibration of data collected in 2012 and with fits of \u03b1 S (M Z ) reported in Sect. 4 show that this is too strong an assumption. Applying the uncertainties and correlations in a fit of \u03b1 S (M Z ) to the inclusive jet data separately for each bin in |y| leads to results with values of \u03b1 S (M Z ) that scatter around a central value. Performing the same fit taking all |y| bins together and assuming 100 % correlation in |y| within the JES uncertainty sources results in a bad fit quality (high \u03c7 2 per number of degrees of freedom n dof ) and a value of \u03b1 S (M Z ) that is significantly higher than any value observed for an individual bin in |y|. Changing the correlation in the JES uncertainty from 0 to 100 % produces a steep rise in \u03c7 2 /n dof , and influences the fitted value of \u03b1 S (M Z ) for correlations near 90 %, indicating an assumption on the correlations in |y| that is too strong.

[1] is used, i.e. the calculations are based on the parton-level program NLOJet++ version 4.1.3 [14,15] and are performed within the fastNLO framework version 2.1 [16]. The renormalization and factorisation scales, \u03bc r and \u03bc f respectively, are identified with the individual jet p T . The number of active (massless) flavours N f in NLOJet++ has been set to five. Five sets of PDFs are available for a series of values of \u03b1 S (M Z ), which is a requisite for a determination of \u03b1 S (M Z ) from data. For an overview, these PDF sets are listed in Table 1 together with the respective references. The ABM11 PDF set employs a fixed-flavour number scheme with five active flavours, while the other PDF sets use a variableflavour number scheme with a maximum of five flavours, N f,max = 5, except for NNPDF2.1 which has N f,max = 6. All sets exist at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading evolution order. The PDF uncertainties are provided at 68.3 % confidence level (CL) except for CT10, which provides uncertainties at 90 % CL. For a uniform treatment of all PDFs, the CT10 uncertainties are downscaled by a factor of \u221a 2 erf \u22121 (0.9) \u2248 1.645. The electroweak corrections to the hard-scattering cross section have been computed with the CT10-NLO PDF set for a fixed number of five flavours and with the p T of the leading jet, p T,max , as scale choice for \u03bc r and \u03bc f instead of the p T of each jet. At high jet p T and central rapidity, where the electroweak effects become sizeable, NLO calculations with either of the two scale settings differ by less than one percent. Given the small impact of the electroweak corrections on the final results in Sects. 4 and 5, no uncertainty on their size has been assigned.",

Data that have been corrected for detector effects, however, refer to measurable particles, i.e. to colour-neutral particles with mean decay lengths such that c\u03c4 > 10 mm. Two complications arise when comparing fixed-order perturbation theory to these measurements: emissions of additional partons close in phase space, which are not sufficiently accounted for in low-order approximations, and effects that cannot be treated by perturbative methods. The first problem is addressed by the parton shower concept [23][24][25] within pQCD, where multiple parton radiation close in phase space is taken into account through an all-orders approximation of the dominant terms including coherence effects. Avoiding double counting, these parton showers are combined with leading-order (LO) calculations in MC event generators, such as pythia [26] and herwig++ [27].",

As a consequence the shape of the \u03c7 2 curve at minimum up to \u03c7 2 + 1 can not be determined completely. To avoid extrapolations based on a polynomial fit to the available points, the alternative \u03b1 S evolution code of the HOPPET package [49] is employed. This is the same evolution code as chosen for the creation of the CT10 PDF set. Replacing the original \u03b1 S evolution in CT10 by HOPPET, \u03b1 S (M Z ) can be set freely and in particular different from the default value used in a PDF set, but at the expense of losing the correlation between the value of \u03b1 S (M Z ) and the fitted PDFs. Downwards or upwards deviations from the lowest and highest values of \u03b1 S (M Z ), respectively, provided in a PDF series are accepted for uncertainty evaluations up to a limit of | \u03b1 S (M Z )| = 0.003.

The six extractions of \u03b1 S (M Z ) are reported in Table 5. The \u03b1 S (M Z ) values are evolved to the corresponding energy scale Q using the twoloop solution to the renormalization group equation (RGE) within HOPPET. The value of Q is calculated as a cross section weighted average in each fit region. These average scale values Q, derived again with the fastNLO framework, are identical within about 1 GeV for different PDFs. To emphasise that theoretical uncertainties limit the achievable precision, Tables 6 and 7 present for the six bins in p T the total uncertainty as well as the experimental, PDF, NP, and scale components, where the six experimental uncertainties are all correlated. Figure 10 presents the running of the strong coupling \u03b1 S (Q) and its total uncertainty as determined in this analysis. The extractions of \u03b1 S (Q) in six separate ranges of Q, as presented in Table 5, are also shown. In the same figure the values of \u03b1 S at lower scales determined by the H1 [57][58][59], ZEUS [60], and D0 [52,53] collaborations are shown for comparison. Recent CMS measurements [55,56], which are in agreement with the \u03b1 S (M Z ) determination of this study, are displayed as well.

            "text": "To study more flexible PDF parameterizations, a MC method based on varying the input data within their correlated uncertainties is employed in combination with a data-based regularisation technique. This method was first used by the NNPDF Collaboration and uses a more flexible parameterization to describe the x dependence of the PDFs [63]. To  avoid the fitting of statistical fluctuations present in the input data (over-fitting) a data-based stopping criterion is introduced. The data set is split randomly into a \"fit\" and a \"control\" sample. The \u03c7 2 minimisation is performed with the \"fit\" sample while simultaneously the \u03c7 2 of the \"control\" sample is calculated using the current PDF parameters. It is observed that the \u03c7 2 of the \"control\" sample at first decreases and then starts to increase again because of over-fitting. At this point, the fit is stopped. This regularisation technique is used in combination with a MC method to estimate the central value and the uncertainties of the fitted PDFs. Before a fit, several hundred replica sets are created by allowing the central values of the measured cross section to fluctuate within their statistical and systematic uncertainties while taking into account all correlations. For each replica, a fit to NLO QCD is performed, which yields an optimum value and uncertainty for each parameter. The collection of all replica fits can then provide an ensemble average and root-mean-square. Moreover, the variations to derive the model dependence of the HER-APDF prescription do not lead to any further increase of the uncertainty. Similarly to Fig. 14 for the HERAPDF method, a direct comparison of the two fit results with total uncertainties is shown in Fig. 15 for the MC method. The total uncertainty derived with the MC method is almost always larger than with the HERAPDF technique, and in the case of the gluon at low x, it is much larger. In both cases a significant reduction of the uncertainty in the gluon PDF is observed, notably in the x range from 10 \u22122 up to 0.5. Both methods also lead to a decrease in the gluon PDF between 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22121 and an increase for larger x. Although this change is more pronounced when applying the MC method, within the respective uncertainties both results are compatible. For the sea quark only small differences in shape are observed, but, in contrast to the HERAPDF method that exhibits reduced uncertainties for x > 0.2, this is not visible when using the MC method. Both methods agree on a very modest reduction in uncertainty at high x > 0.05 in the u valence quark  PDF and a somehwat larger improvement for the d valence quark PDF, which is expected from the correlations, studied in Fig. 11, where the quark distributions are constrained via the qq contribution to jet production at high |y| and p T . Changes in shape of the d valence quark PDF go into opposite directions for the two methods, but are compatible within uncertainties. All preceding figures presented the PDFs at the starting scale of the evolution of Q 2 = 1.9 GeV 2 . For illustration, Fig. 16 displays the PDFs derived with the regularised MC method after evolution to a scale of Q 2 = 10 4 GeV 2 . Finally, Fig. 17 shows an overview of the gluon, sea, u valence, and d valence distributions at the starting scale of Q 2 = 1.9 GeV 2 for both techniques, the HERAPDF and the regularised MC method.",

Lacking a recommended procedure for the scale uncertainties in combined fits of PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ), two evaluations are reported here for the HERAPDF method. In the first one, the combined fit of PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ) is repeated for each variation of the scale factors from the default choice of \u03bc r = \u03bc f = p T for the same six combinations as explained in Sect. 4.2. The scale for the HERA DIS data is not changed. The maximal observed upward and downward changes of \u03b1 S (M Z ) with respect to the default scale factors are then taken as scale uncertainty, irrespective of changes in the PDFs: \u03b1 S (M Z ) = +0.0022 \u22120.0009 (scale). The second procedure is analogous to the method employed to determine \u03b1 S (M Z ) in Sect. 4. The best PDFs are derived for a series of fixed values of \u03b1 S (M Z ) as done for the global PDF sets. Using this series of PDFs with varying values of \u03b1 S (M Z ), the combination of PDF and \u03b1 S (M Z ) that best fits the HERA-I DIS and CMS inclusive jet data is found. The \u03b1 S (M Z ) values determined both ways are consistent with each other. The fits are now repeated for the same scale factor variations, and the maximal observed upward and downward changes of \u03b1 S (M Z ) with respect to the default scale factors are taken as scale uncertainty: \u03b1 S (M Z ) = +0.0024 \u22120.0039 (scale). In contrast to the scale uncertainty of the first procedure, there is less freedom for compensating effects between different gluon distributions and \u03b1 S (M Z ) values in the second procedure, and the latter procedure leads to a larger scale uncertainty as expected. In overall size the uncertainty is similar to the final results on \u03b1 S (M Z ) reported in the last section: \u03b1 S (M Z ) = +0.0053 \u22120.0024 (scale).",

It was found that the published correlations of the experimental uncertainties adequately reflect the detector characteristics and reliable fits of standard model parameters could be performed within each rapidity region.
