This observation of exclusive \u03c7 c , together with earlier observations of exclusive dijets and exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 candidates, support some theoretical predictions for p + p \u2192 p + H + p at the LHC.

            "text": "Central exclusive production at the Tevatron is the process p +p \u2192 p + X +p, where \"+\" means a rapidity gap \u2206y exceeding 3 units, and X is a simple system fully measured. Exchanges (t-channel) over such large gaps must be color singlets with spin J [or Regge intercept \u03b1(0)] \u2265 1.0. Only photons \u03b3 and pomerons IP qualify, apart from W and Z bosons which always cause the proton to break up. The gluon g would qualify apart from its color, but if another gluon is exchanged that can be cancelled, and IP = gg is often a good approximation. It cannot be exact; QCD forbids a pure gg state, and a qq component certainly grows as Q 2 increases. The IP has C = +1; in QCD one should also have a ggg state with C = -1, the odderon [1] O, not yet observed. The central masses M X are roughly limited to M X \u221a s 20 with the outgoing protons having Feynman x F > 0.95. Hence M X 3 GeV at the CERN ISR [2], appropriate for glueball spectroscopy, where M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) shows a broad f 0 (600), a narrow f 0 (980) and still unexplained structure possibly associated with f 0 (1710), a glueball candidate. The study of X = hadrons, e.g. \u03c6\u03c6 and D \u2022D\u2022 to name two channels among many, has not been studied above ISR energies, but CDF is a perfect place to do it and hopefully it will be done.",

There are scenarios (e.g. SUSY) in which FP420 could provide unique measurements, e.g. if there are two nearby states both decaying to bb or to W + W \u2212 .

Both these issues are addressed by CDF in a \"TeV4LHC\" spirit, and they are also very interesting in their own right. The calculation of cross sections (e.g. [6]) involves, in addition to \u03c3(gg \u2192 X), the unintegrated gluon distribution g(x 1 , x 2 ), rapidity gap survival probability (no other parton interactions), and the Sudakov factor (probability of no gluon radiation producing hadrons). The Durham group predicts \u03c3(SM H) for p + H + p at the LHC = 3 \u00d73 \u00f73 fb. At the Tevatron p + H +p is out of reach, but the process p + \u03c7 c (\u03c7 b ) +p is identical as far as QCD is concerned, as is p+\u03b3\u03b3+p. Measuring these constrains the SM H cross section. In CDF we have looked for both exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 [7] and \u03c7 c [8], without however having detectors able to see the p andp. Instead we added forward calorimeters (3.5 < |\u03b7| < 5.1) and beam shower counters BSC (5.5 < |\u03b7| < 7.4). If these are all empty there is a high probability that both p andp escaped intact with small |t|. We also measured [9] exclusive dijets.",

We required all other detectors to be consistent with only noise; then our effective luminosity is only about 10% of the delivered luminosity. We found [7] 3 events with exactly two back-to-back EM -showers (assumed to be photons) with M (\u03b3\u03b3) > 10 GeV/c 2 .

Exclusive 2-photon processes had not previously been observed in hadron-hadron collisions; the cross section agrees with the precise theory prediction. This process has been suggested as a means of calibrating the LHC luminosity; then it must be done in the presence of pile-up, and one will need to know the acceptance etc. at the few % level. More interesting for FP420 is that measurement of an exclusive lepton pair gives both forward proton momenta, with a precision dominated by the incoming beam momentum spread ( \u03b4p p \u2248 10 \u22124 , or 700 MeV). One can do this with pile-up, selecting dileptons with no associated tracks on the l + l \u2212 vertex and \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0. One can also cut on p T (l + l \u2212 ) (correlated with \u2206\u03c6), but \u2206\u03c6 has better resolution. In CDF we found that a cut \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 < 0.8GeV M (l + l \u2212 ) rads is suitable for QED-produced pairs. For each pair one can predict \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 , and, if a proton is in the FP420 acceptance, compare \u03be i and \u03be 420 . This can also possibly map the acceptance A(\u03be, t \u22480), as the cross section shape is known from QED, and the (Coulomb) protons have very small t.",

This is a very rich region, with the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) vector mesons that can only be produced exclusively by photoproduction \u03b3 + IP \u2192 \u03c8, or possibly by odderon exchange: O + IP \u2192 \u03c8. We know what to expect for photoproduction from HERA, so an excess would be evidence for the elusive O. The spectrum [8] is shown in Fig. 1, together with the sum of three components: the vector mesons and a continuum, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , which is again consistent with QED. These central exclusive spectra are exceptionally clean; in fact the biggest background (\u2248 10%) is the identical process but with an undetected p \u2192 p * dissociation. The J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross sections d\u03c3 dy | y=0 , are (3.92\u00b10.62)nb and (0.54\u00b10.15)nb, agreeing with expectations [13,14]. Thus we do not have evidence for O exchange, and put a limit O \u03b3 < 0.34 (95% c.l.), compared with a theory prediction [15] 0.3 -0.6. While the QED and photoproduction processes in Fig. 1 should hold no surprises, their agreement with expectations validates the analysis. We required no EM tower with E EM T > 80 MeV. If we allow such signals (essentially \u03b3's) the number of J/\u03c8 events jumps from 286 to 352, while the number of \u03c8(2S) only increases from 39 to 40. The spectrum of EM showers is shown in Fig. 2. These extra J/\u03c8 events are very consistent with being \u03c7 c0 (3415) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03b3, from IP IP \u2192 \u03c7 c , with about 20% of the \u03b3 being not detected (giving a background of 4% under the exclusive J/\u03c8). We measure d\u03c3 dy (\u03c7 c )| y=0 = (75\u00b114)nb. The existence of this process implies that p + H + p must happen at the LHC (assuming H exists), as the QCD physics is qualitatively identical. The \u03c7 c cross section agrees with predictions: 150nb [16] and 130 \u00d74 \u00f74 nb [6]. It is therefore likely that \u03c3(p + p \u2192 p + SM H + p) is of order 0.5-5 fb, within reach of FP420. In SUSY models the cross section can be much higher [4].",

There are 8 exclusive candidates with \u03c3(p +p \u2192 p + (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 l + l \u2212 ) +p) = 0.24 +0.13 \u22120.10 pb (for |\u03b7(\u00b5)| < 4.0), agreeing with \u03c3(QED) = 0.256 pb. All the events have \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 < 0.013(rad) and p T (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.2 GeV/c. Only one event had ap in the acceptance of the Roman pots when they were operational, and a track was observed, showing that the event was exclusive, and that at the LHC such l + l \u2212 + p events will be available for calibration. If we remove the requirement that the BSC should be empty there are 4 additional events, interpreted as p \u2192 p * dissocation. One of them has M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) \u2248 M (Z) and a larger \u2206\u03c6 and p T than the others, but we cannot claim it to be truly exclusive. We put a limit on exclusive \u03c3 excl (Z) < 0.96 pb at 95% c.l. Clearly it will be interesting to look for exclusive p + Z + p at the LHC. In early running of the LHC, when bunch crossings without pile-up are not yet rare, it is important to measure these exclusive processes, to the extent possible without complete forward coverage. In CMS we have plans to add forward shower counters [20] around the beam pipe to help tag rapidity gaps, together with the ZDC and forward hadron calorimeters. With large forward gaps in both directions, a trigger on two EM showers with E T > 4 GeV should be possible, hopefully observing \u03a5 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , IP IP \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and \u03c7 b \u2192 \u03a5 + \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3. Clean single interactions are surely needed for the \u03c7 b and IP IP \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3; both channels are excellent tests of p + H + p. One may even hope that when exclusive Higgs production is measured, the coupling ggH can be derived by comparing the three cross sections!",
