The number of J/\u03c8 events taken in 2009 is recalculated to be (223.7 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 6 , which is in good agreement with the previous measurement, but with significantly improved precision due to improvements in the BESIII software. The number of J/\u03c8 events taken in 2012 is determined to be (1086.9 \u00b1 6.0) \u00d7 10 6 . In total, the number of J/\u03c8 events collected with the BESIII detector is measured to be (1310.6 \u00b1 7.0) \u00d7 10 6 , where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects and the statistical uncertainty is negligible.",

To further comprehensively study the J/\u03c8 decay mechanism, investigate the light hadron spectrum, and search for exotic states, e.g. glueballs, hybrids and multi-quark states, an additional, larger J/\u03c8 sam-ple was collected in 2012. A precise determination of the number of J/\u03c8 events is essential for analyses based on these data samples. With improvements in the BESIII software, particularly in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the reconstruction of tracks in the main drift chamber (MDC), it is possible to perform a more precise measurement of the number of J/\u03c8 events taken in 2009 and 2012. The relevant data samples used in this analysis are listed in Table 1. We implement the same method as that used in the previous study [4] to determine the number of J/\u03c8 events. The advantage of this approach is that the detection efficiency of inclusive J/\u03c8 decays can be extracted directly from the data sample taken at the peak of the \u03c8(3686). This is useful because the correction factor of the detection efficiency is less dependent on the MC model for the inclusive J/\u03c8 decay and therefore the systematic uncertainty can be reduced significantly. The number of J/\u03c8 events, N J/\u03c8 , is calculated as",

Each track is required to originate from the interaction region by restricting the distance of closest approach to the run-dependent interaction point in the radial direction, V r < 1 cm, and in the beam direction, |V z | < 15 cm.

Therefore, for events with only two charged tracks, we require that the momentum of each charged track is less than 1.5 GeV/c in order to remove Bhabha and dimuon events. This requirement is depicted by the solid lines in the scatter plot of the momenta of the two charged tracks (Fig. 2). The Bhabha events are characterized by a significant peak around 1.5 GeV in the distribution of energy deposited in the EMC, shown in Fig. 3. Hence an additional requirement that the energy deposited in the EMC for each charged track is less than 1 GeV is applied to further reject the Bhabha events. After the above requirements, N sel = (854.60\u00b10.03)\u00d7 10 6 candidate events are selected from the J/\u03c8 data taken in 2012.

To check the effect on the detection efficiency related to the different noise levels, the \u03c8(3686) data and the MC samples are divided into three sub-samples, and the detection efficiency and the correction factor are determined for the three subsamples individually. The resulting maximum change in the number of J/\u03c8 events, 0.06%, is taken as an additional systematic uncertainty associated with the noise realization. The total systematic uncertainty due to the noise is estimated to be 0.12% for the J/\u03c8 events taken in 2009.",

Differences between the data and MC samples may lead to a change in the number of J/\u03c8 events. We compare the multiplicity distribution of J/\u03c8 decays in the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 data sample to that of the J/\u03c8 data at rest to obtain the dependence of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the data. The efficiency determined from the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8(J/\u03c8 \u2192 inclusive) MC sample, \u03c8(3686) MC in Eq. 2, is reweighted with the dependence of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 from the data sample. The resulting change in the number of J/\u03c8 events, 0.28% (0.34%) is taken as the uncertainty for the data taken in 2012 (2009).",
