Low-energy phenomena, such as the binding of quarks and gluons within hadrons, lie in the nonperturbative regime of QCD and are difficult to calculate. Much progress has been made in recent years in the study of beauty mesons [1]; however, many aspects of beauty baryons are still largely unknown. Many decays of beauty mesons into pairs of charm hadrons have branching fractions at the percent level [2]. Decays of beauty baryons into pairs of charm hadrons are expected to be of comparable size, yet none have been observed to date. If such decays do have sizable branching fractions, they could be used to study beauty-baryon properties. For example, a comparison of beauty meson and baryon branching fractions can be used to test factorization in these decays [3].",

Uncertainty in the fit model is largely due to the size of the combinatorial background near the B 0 s peak.
