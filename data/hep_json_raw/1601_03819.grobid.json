Both the b and c quarks decay through the weak interaction and, unlike in cc and bb quarkonia, cannot annihilate into gluons. Consequently, there are many possible final states to explore new aspects of heavy-quark dynamics. Studies of strong-interaction B + c production have been possible only at hadron colliders because of the low center-of-mass energy at e + e \u2212 colliders operating at the \u03a5(4S) resonance and the small qq cross section in e + e \u2212 collisions at the Z resonance. The CDF II detector features significant improvements in the system for reconstructing charged-particle trajectories (tracking) that increase the acceptance and facilitate the detection and precise measurement of the kinematic properties of b hadrons and their decay products. Together with the increased luminosity, this makes it possible to measure more precisely the properties of the B + c meson with the significantly larger samples of B hadrons collected in Run II.",

Excited B + states that contribute to the B + ground state include the radiative decay B * + \u2192 B + \u03b3, as well as orbital excitations of the B + and B 0 mesons, e.g., B * * 0 \u2192 B +( * ) \u03c0 \u2212 . In the case of the B + c meson, besides direct production of the ground state, contributions are only allowed from excited states of the B + c meson itself because of flavor conservation. Therefore, any excited B + c state whose mass is smaller than the sum of the bottom and charm meson masses cascades into the B + c ground state, primarily through radiative decay. For example, the production cross section of the B * + c meson [2] is estimated to be approximately 2.5 times the cross section to the ground state B + c , and the B * + c meson reaches the ground state through the radiative decay B * + c \u2192 B + c \u03b3, where the mass splitting between the B * + c and B + c mesons is estimated to be within the range 40-76 MeV/c 2 [7]. Less important are the Pwave excited B * + cJ,L=1 states whose total cross section is estimated to be about 1/2 of that of direct production to the ground state B + c [8].

On the right side of Eq. (2), the first factor is the relative yield for the two decays, the second term gives the scaling for the relative geometrical acceptance and detection efficiency, and the third term is a correction for the muon efficiency relative to kaons. The overall relative efficiency \u01eb rel is defined by \u01eb rel = \u01eb B + /(\u01eb B + c \u00d7\u01eb \u00b5 ). The selection criteria for both B + c and B + events are made as nearly identical as possible to minimize systematic uncertainties in both the relative yields and in determining \u01eb rel . The number of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays is determined from a fit to the invariant-mass spectrum around the known B + mass value, which includes a background component, a signal component, and a correction for the Cabibbo-suppressed J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + final state. Since the B + c decay is only partially reconstructed, the number of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd candidates is determined by counting the total number of J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + events in the invariant-mass window 4 GeV/c 2 < M (J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + ) < 6 GeV/c 2 and subtracting the contributions of known backgrounds. The quantity M (J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + ) is the invariant mass of the trimuon partial reconstruction of the J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + X final state, where X represents any undetected particles. Because the signal events are spread over a 2 GeV/c 2 invariantmass interval, the background cannot be determined by a simple sideband subtraction. A large fraction of this paper is devoted to describing the methods used to determine the various backgrounds included in the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd candidate sample. The principal classes of background events are the following: a wrongly identified or misidentified-J/\u03c8 candidate with a real third muon, a real J/\u03c8 meson with a wrongly identified or misidentified third muon, and a real J/\u03c8 meson with a real muon that originated from different b quarks in the same event. These backgrounds are determined quantitatively from independent data samples wherever possible and from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation otherwise. We correct for misidentified-J/\u03c8 candidates with misidentified muons that are contained in two of the major backgrounds above and for backgrounds from other B + c decay modes that yield a J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + X final state (for examples see Table XI in Sec. V). The analysis demonstrates that about half of the inclusive J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + X sample is B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd events, and the remainder is background with a small contribution from other B + c decay modes.",

In this analysis the silicon detectors provide precise measurements of the decay vertices for B + c and B + candidates. The 310 cm long COT [14] is an open-cell multiwire proportional drift chamber consisting of 96 sensewire layers from r = 40 cm to r = 137 cm. The layers are grouped into alternating axial and \u00b12 \u2022 stereo superlayers. The relative positions of the silicon and COT tracking systems are shown in Fig. 2. The COT alone provides excellent track reconstruction and momentum resolution. For the combined COT, ISL, and SVX II tracking system, the asymptotic transverse momentum resolution \u03b4p T /p T has a p T dependence given by \u03b4p T /p T = 0.0007p T (GeV/c). In addition the COT provides sampling of the specific-ionization-energy loss dE/dx along a track, which provides particle-type identification [15].",

They arise because of mass resolution effects associated with the decay in flight of pions and kaons where the decay muon is ultimately matched with a third track and results in the event contributing to the misidentified-muon background. The misidentified-muon probabilities determined above are derived under the assumption that the pion and kaon tracks, even after a possible kink resulting from a decay in flight, yield a two-body invariant mass that remains within 50 MeV/c 2 of the known D 0 mass. However, the mass resolution can be spoiled because of a kink, while the pion or kaon track is still matched to a CMUP muon. Because the signal region for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd decays has a width of 2 GeV/c 2 , background events from decays in flight may contribute to the signal region but remain excluded from the measurement of the probability that a pion or kaon is misidentified as a muon using the decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . We correct for this effect by determining the fraction F out h (h is a pion or kaon) of misidentified events that fall outside of the D 0 mass peak for a given particle type through a MC simulation.",

The rationale is as follows: Fig. 8 shows that the muon misidentification probabilities for K + mesons are significantly higher than for K \u2212 mesons. This difference arises because K + mesons have an additional punch-through component, which is not present for K \u2212 mesons because the strong-interaction cross section in matter for K \u2212 mesons is larger than that for K + mesons. The punch-through component does not produce any kink in the track and for this component of \u01eb K + the outsideof-peak correction should not be applied.

Numerical results are given in Table V.  the third muon produced from the decay of theb quark in the same event, or vice versa. The production of bb pairs in pp collisions is dominated by the leading-order flavor-creation (FC) process and the next-to-leading order flavor-excitation (FE) and gluon-splitting (GS) processes [33]. Flavor creation corresponds to the production of a bb pair by gluon fusion or by the annihilation of light quarks via two 2-to-2 parton subprocesses gg \u2192 bb and qq \u2192 bb. Flavor excitation refers to the QCD hard 2-to-2 reaction corresponding to the scattering of a b quark out of the initial state into the final state by a gluon or a light quark or light antiquark via the subprocesses gb \u2192 gb, qb \u2192 qb, andqb \u2192qb. Theb partner from the original initial state bb pair will also appear in the final state. There are three more processes corresponding to the scattering of theb quarks in the high Q 2 sea of gluons and heavy-quark pairs that define the p andp structure functions. Gluon splitting occurs when only gluons and light quarks and light antiquarks participate in the 2-to-2 hard parton scattering subprocess, but one of the final-state gluons fragments into a bb pair, e.g., gg \u2192 g(g \u2192 bb) or qg \u2192 q(g \u2192 bb). Flavor creation is expected to produce the largest opening angles between the quark pairs, as measured in the plane transverse to the beam direction. Flavor excitation is expected to produce both large and small opening angles, and gluon splitting is expected to produce a relatively uniform distribution of opening angles [28,29].",

We constrain the pythia MC simulation with the experimental data using the distribution of the opening angle \u2206\u03c6 between the J/\u03c8 and the muon in an event. We select a sample of experimental data called the unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + -pairs sample as described in Sec. IV C 1 below. \"Unvertexed\" means that there are no requirements that the J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs originate from a common vertex. From this sample we subtract potential signal candidates as well as unvertexed variations of the major backgrounds described above. We fit the \u2206\u03c6 distribution in these data with a linear combination of the \u2206\u03c6 distributions of pythia-simulated FC, FE, and GS events that are also unvertexed. This procedure allows for a determination of the relative fractions of FC, FE, and GS to use in estimating the bb background irrespective of the relative fractions that any particular variation of the pythia parameters might produce. Using the experimentally constrained fractions for the FC, FE, and GS contributions, we calculate the bb background by applying the selection requirements for the J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + -signal sample to the unselected pythia-simulated FC, FE, and GS samples. A valuable cross check of the background determination consists in comparing the sum of all of the backgrounds with the number of events in the J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + invariant-mass ranges 3-4 GeV/c 2 and greater than 6 GeV/c 2 , where the number of events is dominated by background.",

            "text": "To produce a pure sample of bb pairs to compare with the pythia simulation, it is necessary to estimate the contributions from the non-bb sources listed above and then subtract them from the selected sample of unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs shown in Fig. 17a. The first non-bb source is identified by applying the vertex probability requirement to the unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs, and its \u2206\u03c6 distribution is shown in Fig. 17b, labeled as \"B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd\" candidates. The essential difference between this B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd sample and the signal sample is that the \u2206\u03c6 selection criterion is not applied in order to compare the bb data sample with the MC simulation over the entire range of \u2206\u03c6. Next, we estimate the unvertexed-misidentified-muon background with the procedure described in Sec. IV B using the unvertexed-J/\u03c8-track sample with the vertexed events subtracted. The \u2206\u03c6 distribution of unvertexedmisidentified-muon background is also shown in Fig. 17b. Finally, the events containing an unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pair, where the J/\u03c8 is misidentified, are accounted by the method of Sec. IV A using the events from the dimuon mass sidebands of the unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + -pairs sample. The \u2206\u03c6 distribution of misidentified J/\u03c8 in the unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + -pairs sample is also shown in Fig. 17b. Subtracting the three non-bb sources shown in Fig. 17b from the unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs in Fig. 17a gives the background-subtracted sample of unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs. This pure bb sample is shown in Fig. 17c and is used to determine the relative fractions of the QCD production processes generated by the pythia simulations.",

The factors S FC , S GS , and C together with Eq. (10) are used in Sec. IV C 4 to calculate the number of bb background events. One source of systematic uncertainty in the determination of the bb background arises from the choice to force the contribution of FE to be zero. We estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty using the difference between the predicted number of bb events for the two values 0 and 0.1 for S FE . A second source is introduced by the uncertainty in the estimate of the unvertexedmisidentified-muon component of the \u2206\u03c6 distribution of unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + events. The misidentified-muon component is removed prior to fitting the pythia predictions to the data; hence, its uncertainty propagates into the determination of the bb background. To determine this systematic uncertainty, the \u2206\u03c6 distribution of unvertexed-J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + pairs shown in Fig. 17c is increased and decreased by the amount of the lower and upper values of the unvertexed-misidentified-muon systematic uncertainty, respectively. The scale factors are refit for these two cases and the change in the predicted bb background is determined. The systematic uncertainties from these two sources are summarized in Table VII. The total systematic uncertainty is calculated by adding the results from the three rows in quadrature.",

In the greater than 6 GeV/c 2 region, we expect 28 and observe 46\u00b119. This gives confidence in the calculation of the sum of background yield plus other decay modes in the signal region.",

The mass difference between the B * + c and the B + c is too small for \u03c0 0 production. Consequently, the B * + c are assumed to decay exclusively to the B + c \u03b3 final state. B.

In Eq. 14the statistical and systematic uncertainties are from the measurement of R and \"other\" is the combined experimental uncertainty in the measurements of B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + ) and \u03c3(B + ). Combining the uncertainties in quadrature gives \u03c3(B + c )B(B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd) = 0.60 \u00b1 0.09 nb. To extract the total B + c production cross section from this result, it is necessary to consider the predictions for the branching fraction for the semileptonic decay B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd. Table XX summarizes the many predictions. The approaches to the calculation of this semileptonic branching fraction include: QCD sum rules [5,37], relativistic constituent-quark models [6,38,39], a quark model using the Bethe-Salpeter equation [40], a nonrelativistic constituent-quark model [41], covariant-lightfront quark models [42][43][44], QCD relativistic-potential models [45,46], and non-relativistic QCD [47]. With the exception of Ref. [47], all of the theoretical results shown in Table XX predict the branching fraction B(B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd) in the range 1.15-2.37 %. Using this selection of theoretical predictions, we find the total B + c cross section to be in the range 25\u00b14 to 52\u00b18 nb for p T (B + c ) > 6 GeV/c and |y| < 1, where the uncertainties reflect only the experimental uncertainties of the measurements used in the calculation. The result is a measure of the combined cross section for production to the ground state plus any excited B + c state that cascades into the ground state prior to its weak-interaction decay.",
