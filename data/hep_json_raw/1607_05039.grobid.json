The study includes a comparison of perturbative and non-perturbative jet energy corrections and the response under realistic background conditions. Several algorithms are benchmarked with a detailed detector simulation at \u221a s = 3 TeV. We find that the classical e + e \u2212 algorithms, with or without beam jets, have the best response, but they are inadequate in environments with non-negligible background. The Valencia algorithm and longitudinally invariant k t algorithms have a much more robust performance, with a slight advantage for the former.",

Linear e + e \u2212 colliders are the best tool to explore the energy range from several 100 GeV to a few TeV. The Technical Design Report of the International Linear Collider (ILC [1,2]) project envisages a programme of precision Higgs and top physics at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 250, 500 GeV and, after an energy upgrade, 1 TeV. The compact linear collider (CLIC [3]) scheme has been shown to reach accelerating gradients that extend the e + e \u2212 programme into the multi-TeV regime. CLIC envisages a first phase at \u221a s = 380 GeV, followed by its highenergy programme of multi-TeV operation, with stages at 1.5 and 3 TeV [4]. A large circular machine, as envisaged by the FCCee [5] and CEPC [6] projects, could provide high luminosity at 250 GeV. FCCee may reach the top-quark pair This work was carried out in the framework of the CLICdp collaboration.",

These particle-level simulations are also used to study the impact of energy deposited on the signal event by background processes.

The dominant branching ratios of the W , Z and Higgs bosons are from hadronic decays. Final states with four jets, most notably e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh, play a key role in the physics programme of any future electron-positron collider. At high-energy final states with six jets (e.g. e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt), or even eight or ten jets (e.g. e + e \u2212 \u2192 tth), become important. Imperfect clustering of final-state particles can affect the reconstruction of hadronic decays in an important way. The impact of incorrect assignments of final-state particles to jets is illustrated with an example. We consider the Higgsstrahlung process with hadronic decays of Z -and Higgs bosons, where reliable reconstruction of Z and h-boson candidates is the key to a precise measurement of the Higgs boson couplings [22]. The hard scattering process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Zh is simulated with the MadGraph_aMC@NLO [23] pack- Higgs boson candidates are formed by adding the fourvectors of the two jets that yield the di-jet mass closest to the Higgs boson mass. In Fig. 1 the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs boson candidates is shown for three centre-ofmass energies. We find that the distribution has a non-zero width, even in this relatively perfect simulation. The finite resolution is purely due to imperfect clustering of final-state particles into jets. The effect of confusion in jet clustering is less pronounced at higher centre-of-mass energy, as the greater boost of the Z -and Higgs bosons leads to a cleaner separation of the jets.",

The generalised e + e \u2212 algorithm again converges fastest. We have estimated the nonperturbative correction also for the jet invariant mass: these corrections are much larger than the non-perturbative energy corrections and remain of the order of a few % even for R = 1.5 and \u221a s = 3 TeV. The forward-peaked \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192hadrons background at future high-energy linear lepton colliders is one of the most important factors in the jet reconstruction performance. It has motivated ILC and CLIC to abandon classical, inclusive algorithms in favour of algorithms with a finite jet size. Algorithms that expose a reduced solid angle in the forward region of the detector, such as longitudinally invariant k t or VLC are more robust. A particle-level study shows that these two algorithms have a different response, with VLC showing a lower response, but one that is more stable versus polar angle.
