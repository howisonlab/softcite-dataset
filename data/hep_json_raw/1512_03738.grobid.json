The main detectors used in the analyses are the Inner Tracking System, Time Projection Chamber and Time-Of-Flight detector, all located at mid-rapidity. The dielectron yield in p-Pb collisions shows an overall agreement with the hadronic cocktail. The pair transverse momentum distributions are sensitive to the contributions from open heavyflavours. In Pb-Pb collisions, uncorrected background-subtracted yields have been extracted in two centrality classes. In pp collisions the production of virtual photons relative to the inclusive yield is determined by analyzing the dielectron excess with respect to the expected hadronic sources. The direct photon cross section is then calculated and found to be in agreement with NLO pQCD calculations. A feasibility study for LHC Run 3 after the ALICE upgrade indicates the possibility for a future measurement of the early effective temperature.",

Additionally, dielectrons from semileptonic decays of correlated heavy-quark mesons carry information on the heavy-flavour production in the different collision systems. Low-mass dielectrons are also produced by internal conversion of virtual direct photons. To quantify modifications of the dielectron production in heavy-ion collisions, measurements in pp collisions serve as a reference, while the analysis of p-A collisions allows disentangling cold from hot nuclear matter effects. In ALICE [1] at the LHC, dielectron measurements are performed using the central barrel detectors at mid-rapidity. In this proceedings we present the invariant mass analyses in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, a mass-differential study in p-Pb, and a virtual direct photon measurement in pp collisions. Prospects of a future measurement in Pb-Pb collisions after the ALICE upgrade for LHC Run 3 are also discussed.",

            "text": "The analyses presented here are based on 3 ULS /N mix LS and stays within 5% around unity for the full invariant mass range considered in these analyses.  The corrected dielectron yield in p-Pb collisions, integrated over pair-p T (p ee T ), is shown in Fig. 1. The data points and systematic uncertainties are extracted from the mean values and the spread of results obtained with 22 different combinations of analysis cut settings (inspired by [2]). The data are compared to the hadronic cocktail, which uses the charged pion measurement [3] as \u03c0 0 input and m T -scaling for the other light mesons. Open heavy-flavour and J/\u03c8 contributions are calculated from PYTHIA, tuned to independent ALICE measurements in pp and p-Pb collisions [4,5]. Uncertainties coming from the input of the cocktail sources are shown as a grey band in Fig. 1. Data and cocktail are in reasonable agreement within their uncertainties over the full mass range. Figure 2 shows, for Pb-Pb collisions in both centralities, the background-subtracted uncorrected yields in the low-mass region for 1 < p ee T < 2 GeV/c. The corresponding signal-to-background ratios within 0.2 < m ee < 0.5 GeV/c 2 are 0.01 for 20-50% and 0.003 for 0-10% centrality. The efficiency correction and cocktail comparison are in progress. The kinematic region p ee T m ee is useful to study the production of virtual direct photons. Figure 3 shows the differential dielectron cross-section in pp collisions at low m ee for one pair-p T region, compared to a hadronic cocktail and its components. Also shown is the expected mass distribution of dielectrons coming from virtual direct photons, after having applied the single-electron fiducial cuts on p T and \u03b7. A fit to the data is performed to determine the virtual photon fraction r by using the function f combined = (1\u2212r)\u2022 f cocktail +r\u2022 f \u03b3,dir in the range 0.1 < m ee < 0.4 GeV/c 2 . This fit is done in four pair-p T regions and the extracted virtual photon fraction is then multiplied by the inclusive photon cross section, also measured by ALICE via the photon conversion method (PCM) [6]. In Figure 4 the resulting direct photon cross section is compared to NLO  pQCD calculations. Reasonable agreement is found, within uncertainties, between data and model. Details on this analysis can be found in [7]. The dielectron yield in p-Pb collisions is analyzed as a function of pair-p T in different mass regions to gain additional sensitivity in the hadronic cocktail comparison. At LHC energies, heavy-flavour contributions already become relevant for 0.14 < m ee < 0.75 GeV/c 2 , as shown in Fig. 5, while they completely dominate the spectrum for 1.1 < m ee < 3.0 GeV/c 2 , as shown in Fig. 6. The analysis is being extended to higher momenta to evaluate different model calculations and extract heavy-flavour cross sections. ",

We evaluated to which precision a possible thermal excess yield [9] could be reconstructed in Pb-Pb collisions at full LHC energy ( \u221a s NN = 5.5 TeV). A sample of electron candidates is created according to the expected detector performance after the upgrade, additionally being operated at a reduced solenoid magnetic field to increase the acceptance. A statistical significance is calculated from realistically constructed signal and background spectra, and is then used for Poisson sampling of data points around the model input, both shown in Fig. 7. A DCA cut (distance of closest approach between track and vertex) is applied to suppress the cc contribution. Figure 8 shows the expected spectrum after subtraction of the hadronic sources, where a thermal fit can be applied. The ALICE upgrade is expected to allow for a temperature measurement in the intermediate mass region within 10% statistical (based on 2.5 \u2022 10 9 events) and 20% systematic uncertainty [10].",
