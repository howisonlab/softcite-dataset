The ISR luminosity is determined from a study of the leptonic process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3)\u03b3ISR, which is found to agree with the next-to-leading-order QED prediction to within 1.1%. The cross section for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) is obtained with a systematic uncertainty of 0.5% in the dominant \u03c1 resonance region. The leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic anomaly calculated using the measured \u03c0\u03c0 cross section from threshold to 1.8 GeV is (514.1\u00b12.2(stat)\u00b13.1(syst))\u00d710 \u221210 .",

Theoretical calculations are related to hadronic production rates in e + e \u2212 annihilation via dispersion relations. As perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic theory fails in the energy regions where resonances occur, measurements of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons cross section are necessary to evaluate the dispersion integrals. Of particular interest is the contribution a had \u00b5 to the muon magnetic moment anomaly a \u00b5 , which requires data in a region dominated by the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3). The accuracy of the theoretical prediction for a \u00b5 is linked to the advances in e + e \u2212 measurements. A discrepancy of roughly 3 standard deviations (\u03c3) including systematic uncertainties between the measured [1] and predicted [2][3][4] values of a \u00b5 persisted for years before the results of this analysis became available [7], possibly hinting at new physics. An independent approach using \u03c4 decay data leads to a smaller difference of 1.8\u03c3 [5] in the same direction, with enlarged systematic uncertainties due to isospin-breaking corrections.",

The main advantage of the ISR approach is that the final-state mass spectrum is obtained in a single configuration of the e + e \u2212 storage rings and of the detection apparatus, thus providing a cross section measurement over a wide mass range starting at threshold. Consequently, a better control of the systematic errors can be achieved compared to the energy-scan method, which necessitates different experiments and colliders to cover the same range. The disadvantage is the reduction of the measured cross section, which is suppressed by one order of \u03b1. This is offset by the availability of high-luminosity e + e \u2212 storage rings, primarily designed as B and K factories in order to study CP violation.",

The reduced energy is related to the energy E * \u03b3 of the ISR photon in the e + e \u2212 centerof-mass (c.m.) frame by s \u2032 = s(1 \u2212 2E * \u03b3 / \u221a s), where s is the square of the e + e \u2212 c.m. energy. In this analysis, s \u223c (10.58 GeV) 2 and \u221a s \u2032 ranges from the two-pion production threshold to 3 GeV. Two-body ISR processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 X\u03b3 with X = \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) and X = \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3) are measured, where the ISR photon is detected at large angle to the beams, and the charged particle pair can be accompanied by a final-state radiation (FSR) photon. Figure 1 shows the Feynman diagrams relevant to this study. The lowest-order (LO) radiated photon can be either from ISR or FSR. In the muon channel, ISR is dominant in the measurement range, but the LO FSR contribution needs to be subtracted using QED. In the pion channel, the LO FSR calculation is model-dependent, but the contribution is strongly suppressed due to the large s value. In both channels, interference between ISR and FSR amplitudes vanishes for a charge-symmetric detector.",

Since individual trigger and filter line responses are stored for every recorded event, efficiencies can be computed by comparing the response of trigger lines, after choosing lines that are as orthogonal and as efficient as possible. Trigger efficiencies are determined on data and simulation samples, after applying identical event selections and measurement methods, and data/MC corrections C trig are computed from the comparison of measured efficiencies on backgroundsubtracted data and signal MC.

Both of them are efficient for \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 ISR events. For \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 ISR events, the small efficiency of the calorimetric trigger limits the statistical precision of the track-trigger and overall efficiency measurements. Furthermore, a correlated change of the two trigger line responses for close-by tracks induces both a non-uniformity in the efficiency and a bias in the efficiency measurement. This originates from the overlap of tracks in the drift chamber and of showers in the EMC, which induces a simultaneous decrease in the track-trigger efficiency and an increase in the calorimetric-trigger efficiency. Overlap is a major source of overall inefficiency and difference between data and simulation, necessitating specific studies.

This \u03c0 0 veto is not applied to the pion tracking sample, because of the bias it would introduce on the inefficiency related to secondary interactions. The events are required to pass the triggers and online filter and are selected without specific requirements on the second reconstructed track, if any. Biases affecting the tracking- efficiency measurement introduced by the primary-track selection or event-level background-rejection criteria are identified and studied with simulation, and evaluated with data. The predicted track is required to lie within the tracking acceptance, taking into account the effect of angular and momentum resolution. The method therefore determines the efficiency to reconstruct a given track in the SVT+DCH system within a specified geometrical acceptance, no matter how close or distant this track is with respect to the expected one, due for instance to decays or secondary interactions. However, the possible mismatch in momentum and/or angles affects the full kinematic reconstruction of the event, and its effect is included in the efficiency of the corresponding \u03c7 2 selection applied to the physics sample (Sect.

Not only is the individual track efficiency locally reduced, but a correlated loss of the two tracks is observed. In addition, as the final physics sample is required to have two and only two good tracks with opposite charge, the understanding of the tracking involves not only track losses, but also the probability to reconstruct extra tracks as a result of secondary interactions with the detector material or the presence of beambackground tracks. The full tracking efficiency is then the product of the square of the single-track efficiencies, the probability for not losing the two tracks in a correlated way (loss probability = f 0 ), and the probability for not having an extra reconstructed track (loss probability = f 3 ).

To reduce the backgrounds, the mass range of selected \u03c0\u03c0(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR candidates is restricted to the \u03c1 peak, 0.6 < m \u03c0\u03c0 < 0.9 GeV/c 2 . To ensure the validity of the pion ID efficiency measurement, the purity of the pion ID sample is further increased by requiring the primary track to satisfy the 'hard pion' tag. In the restricted mass range, the sum of \u00b5, K and e backgrounds is reduced to the (3.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22123 level. While for muons it is possible to measure the ID efficiencies for isolated tracks using events with a large m \u00b5\u00b5 mass, for pions we use events in the \u03c1 region. Tracks in this region may overlap in one detector or another. Thus the \u03c0-ID efficiencies and mis-ID probabilities contain some average of overlap effects, which are not possible to sort out in detail. However these effects are much reduced for pions compared to muons, since showering in the IFR is sufficient to distinguish hadrons from muons and the overlap of pion showers does not degrade the pion-ID efficiency.",

These effects are studied with simulated \u03c0\u03c0(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR signal samples, by comparing the mass spectra of produced events when \u03c0-ID is either applied or not. The former spectrum is obtained by applying the PID process, then correcting the '\u03c0\u03c0' spectrum by the \u03c0-ID efficiency determined as in data. The latter spectrum is obtained by not applying any PID requirement. As expected, the agreement is excellent in the \u03c1 region with a variation of at most 2 permil, while some bias is observed in the lower and higher mass regions: 1% for m \u03c0\u03c0 < 0.4 GeV/c 2 , 6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for 0.4 < m \u03c0\u03c0 < 0.6 GeV/c 2 , 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for 0.9 < m \u03c0\u03c0 < 1.2 GeV/c 2 , and 1% for m \u03c0\u03c0 > 1.2 GeV/c 2 . The full bias determined in simulation is taken as a sys- tematic uncertainty. The global PID test in data described below supports this estimate. In this analysis a good control of the \u03c0 \u2192 '\u00b5' mis-ID probability is crucial to the determination of the \u00b5\u00b5(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR cross section in the \u03c1 region. At track level this probability in data is found to vary with momentum between 4.5% at 5 GeV/c and 7% at 1 GeV/c, and the data/MC correction is determined to be 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 and 1.23 \u00b1 0.03, respectively.",

The main component of this sub-sample is from FSR but a contribution from large-angle ISR is estimated from the \u03b8 \u00b5\u03b32 distribution and taken with a 25% systematic uncertainty. Absolute rates in data and MC are compared, showing a good agreement up to E \u03b3 add.FSR \u223c 2 GeV, and a small excess in data in the tail above. After correction for the remaining ISR contribution below 20 \u2022 , the ratio data/MC for the fraction of additional FSR amounts to 0.96 \u00b1 0.06. Therefore the use of PHOTOS to generate FSR photons is in good agreement with data and adequate for our precision goal, since the uncertainty on the FSR rate represents about 8\u00d710 \u22124 of the total \u00b5\u00b5(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR sample. Figure 15 (right) shows the same distributions for pions after subtraction of the residual \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 background. From the comparison of data and MC events in the FSR region defined by ln(\u03c7 2 FSR + 1) < ln(\u03c7 2 ISR + 1), E \u03b3 add.FSR > 0.2 GeV, and \u03b8 \u03c0\u03b32 < 10 \u2022 , some excess is observed in \u03c0\u03c0(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR data with respect to the PHO-TOS expectation. In the 0.5-1.0 GeV/c 2 mass range, the excess is (21 \u00b1 5)%, taking into account subtraction of background and the large-angle ISR contribution. This difference is accounted for in the determination of the \u03c7 2 selection efficiency, as discussed below. After the hadronic channels are removed using the PID (Sect. IV D 8), the remaining background contributions to the \u00b5\u00b5(\u03b3)\u03b3 ISR sample are essentially from \u03c4 \u03c4 (\u03b3) events with two muons in the final state, or one muon and a pion misidentified as 'muon'. This contribution is small and well simulated, so it can be handled easily even in the background (BG) region of the 2D-\u03c7 2 plane (Sect. VI A). Thus the determination of the loose \u03c7 2 selection efficiency is straightforward in the muon channel. In contrast, for the pion channel, it is not possible to directly measure the efficiency of the 2D-\u03c7 2 selection in data because of an overwhelming background in the rejected region (controlling the loose selection), even in the intermediate region (controlling the tight selection).",

At each step of the iterative re-weighting process, the data-MC differences of reconstructed spectra are unfolded and added to the true MC spectrum. Such iterative procedures can result in a significant bias to the final results if statistical fluctuations are mis-interpreted as true differences between data and MC distributions. The stability of the method is provided in this analysis by the use of a regularization function to avoid unfolding large fluctuations in the data, due for example to a large background subtraction.

The advantage of Phokhara is that it uses the almost-exact QED NLO calculation (without ISR-FSR interference). However, contrary to AfkQed, it does not include the contribution from two FSR photons nor higher-order ISR emission. Both effects are expected to be at a very small level. The contribution of two FSR photons is suppressed by the smallness of LO FSR (about 1% at 1 GeV and 15% at 3 GeV) and NLO FSR (< 1% at 1 GeV and 2.7% at 3 GeV) corrections for photon energies E \u03b3 add.FSR > 0.2 GeV.

This shows that the GS function, the parameters of which are mainly determined in the \u03c1 peak region, together with the constraint at s \u2032 = 0, does not accurately describe the resonance tails. At higher masses, the validity of the VDM description that involves the parametrization of very broad resonances with large inelasticity, is somewhat arguable. However the overall agreement is satisfactory, notably in the 0.5-1.0 GeV region. We compare the results for the resonance parameters (Table VI) to those obtained by other experiments, noting that the comparison can be biased if the mass range or the parametrizations are different. The fitted \u03c1 parameters are compared to the results from CMD-2 [35] and SND [36]: for the mass m \u03c1 , these two experiments obtain (776.0 \u00b1 0.8) MeV/c 2 and (774.6 \u00b1 0.6) MeV/c 2 , respectively, while for the width \u0393 \u03c1 , they obtain (146.0 \u00b1 0.9) MeV and (146.1 \u00b1 1.7) MeV. The fitted value of the phase \u03c6 \u03c9 of the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 interference is not in good agreement with the CMD-2 value (0.182 \u00b1 0.067 rad); SND uses a different parametrization. However in the CMD-2 fit, the \u03c9 mass is fixed to the world-average value m \u03c9 = 782.65 MeV/c 2 [24]. If we fix m \u03c9 to this value in the BABAR fit, the phase comes out to be (0.137 \u00b1 0.023) rad, in agreement with CMD-2. In fact in the 18-parameter fit the fitted values for m \u03c9 , \u03c6 \u03c9 , and c \u03c9 are strongly correlated (80%). The fitted \u03c9 width \u0393 \u03c9 is found to be consistent with the world-average value (8.49 \u00b1 0.08) MeV obtained from the dominant \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay mode [24].",

This procedure also compensated for the relatively poorer quality of data in this region. The BABAR continuous low-mass data permit a direct evaluation, consistent with the constrained method. The very small contribution (0.55 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10 \u221210 between the 2\u03c0 threshold and 0.3 GeV is evaluated using the extrapolation of the constrained fit to the data between 0.3-0.5 GeV. The BABAR results are given in Table VII in different mass ranges. The upper boundary (1.8 GeV) is chosen in accordance with previous evaluations [2], in which the contribution of the higher energy region was computed using QCD. The contribution in the 1.8-3 GeV range, obtained with the present BABAR data, is indeed only (0.21 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , thus negligible with respect to the uncertainty in the main region. The contribution from threshold to 1.8 GeV is obtained for the first time from a single experiment: a \u03c0\u03c0(\u03b3),LO \u00b5 = (514.09 \u00b1 2.22 \u00b1 3.11) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , (41) where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The total uncertainty is 3.82 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , so that the precision of the measurement is 0.74%. B. Comparison to other determinations using e + e \u2212 and \u03c4 data Direct comparison to the results from other experiments is complicated by two facts: (i) e + e \u2212 scan experiments provide cross section measurements at discrete and unequally spaced energy values, while the ISR method provides a continuous spectrum, (ii) unlike BABAR, other experiments do not all cover the complete mass spectrum from threshold up to energies where the contributions become negligible. The latter problem is alleviated by appropriately combining different sets of measurements performed by the same experiment. Where gaps remain, they are filled by using the weighted-average cross section values from the other experiments. This approach has been thoroughly treated in Ref. [6], from which we extract the relevant integrals. The fraction of contributions to the integrals estimated in this way ranges from 3% for KLOE to 11% for CMD-2 (7% for SND), engendering some correlations between the total values (given in the energy range from 2m \u03c0 to 1.8 GeV).",

Except for a few channels still unmeasured, BABAR results bring a new level of precision and dominate the picture. We follow here the recent analysis of Ref.
