The measured cross section for 0.5 < pT < 5.0 GeV/c and 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 3.8 is well described by a next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculation. The asymmetries AN have been measured as a function of Feynman-x (xF ) from 0.2 < |xF | < 0.7, as well as transverse momentum (pT ) from 1.0 < pT < 4.5 GeV/c. The asymmetry averaged over positive xF is AN = 0.061\u00b10.014. The results are consistent with prior transverse single-spin measurements of forward \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 mesons at various energies in overlapping xF ranges. Comparison of different particle species can help to determine the origin of the large observed asymmetries in p \u2191 + p collisions.",

            "text": "Since the proton's magnetic moment was revealed to be 2.79 times the size of the Dirac magnetic moment [1], studying the internal structure of the proton has been a vibrant field of physics research. Early deep-inelastic electron-nucleon scattering (DIS) experiments found that leptons were elastically scattered off of partons [2][3][4], and further measurements have led to detailed understanding of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) that can be used to describe the collinear quark and gluon structure of the nucleon. At leading order in a perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) expansion in the strong coupling \u03b1 s , PDF f (x) represents the probability of a parton of flavor f carrying momentum fraction x of the total proton momentum. The PDFs themselves are nonperturbative and cannot be calculated directly in pQCD; they must instead be extracted from experimental measurements. From the development of QCD until the 1990s, experimental and theoretical studies focused on the one-dimensional momentum structure of the nucleon, in which the partons are treated as moving collinearly with the parent nucleon. Over the last two decades, a variety of theoretical and experimental tools have been developed to study other aspects of nucleon structure, including parton transverse dynamics within the nucleon. The measurement of transverse single spin asymmetries (SSAs) provides one window into dynamical spin-momentum correlations both in QCD bound states and in the process of partonic hadronization.",

            "text": "Leading-twist pQCD calculations predict very small transverse single spin asymmetries, less than O(10 \u22124 ) at highp T (p T > few GeV/c) [5]. However, strikingly large transverse SSAs, up to \u223c 40%, have been measured at forward rapidity for hadrons produced from transversely polarized proton collisions (p \u2191 +p \u2192 h+X), revealing significant spinmomentum correlations in the nonperturbative structure of the proton. These asymmetries have been observed for collision energies ranging from \u221a s = 4.9 to 500 GeV [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] and for hadron transverse momenta (p T ) up to 7 GeV/c [16]. The persistence of transverse SSAs into kinematic regimes where pQCD is applicable offers an opportunity to describe this nonperturbative behavior in terms of well-defined functions using the framework of pQCD. At midrapidity, no significant A N has been observed [15,17].",

Transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) PDFs include explicit dependence not only on the partonic collinear momentum fraction but also on the partonic transverse momentum (k T ) within the nucleon. Similarly, TMD fragmentation functions (FFs) depend on both the collinear momentum fraction of the scattered parton acquired by the produced hadron as well as the transverse momentum of the hadron with respect to the direction of the scattered parton.

Semi-inclusive DIS experiments have found evidence for a nonzero Sivers TMD PDF [20][21][22][23]. Collins alternatively proposed a TMD FF [24] that generates transverse SSAs, corresponding to a correlation between the (transverse) polarization of a scattered quark and the angular distribution of pions in the quark jet. The outgoing quarks in p \u2191 +p collisions will have a net transverse polarization if the transversity distribution in the proton is nonzero. Electron-positron annihilation, as well as semi-inclusive DIS measurements, have now found evidence for a nonzero Collins TMD FF as well as a nonzero transversity distribution [20,22,[25][26][27][28][29]. All these results indicate that there are sizable spin-momentum correlation effects in QCD bound states as well as in the process of hadronization.",

While these correlation functions do not contain direct information on the transverse momentum distributions of partons, this approach has been related to k T -moments of TMD PDFs and FFs such as the Sivers and Collins functions for multiparton correlations in the initial and final state, respectively [38]. Prior RHIC transverse SSA measurements for inclusive hadron production have been described relatively well by a combination of twist-3 effects in the initial and final states [39][40][41][42], but further refinement in both the theoretical calculations, for example through a better understanding of uncertainties, and in experimental measurements, for example through multi-differential measurements in more than one kinematic variable simultaneously, will be needed to test and understand these correlations in detail.",

In this case any phenomenology used to describe the asymmetries might become more complex, depending on the size of the effects from factorization breaking. The breakdown of TMD-factorization leads to the prediction of additional spin asymmetries in the case of hadron production in p \u2191 +p collisions [44], with the possible magnitude of any new asymmetries still unknown. These effects, due to color exchange, will be interesting to explore further at RHIC once phenomenological predictions become available.",

The MPC covers the pseudorapidity regions -3.7 < \u03b7 < -3.1 and 3.1 < \u03b7 < 3.9, respectively. The primary goal of the MPC is to identify \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons and measure their energy. P bW O 4 crystals were chosen for their short radiation length (0.89 cm) and small Moli\u00e8re radius (2.0 cm). Similar P bW O 4 crystals were originally used and extensively tested for the PHOS detector [51], part of the ALICE experiment at CERN. The MPC is not cooled, and runs at the ambient temperature of its location in PHENIX. The gain variation with time, due largely to temperature variations and radiation damage to the crystals and APDs, is tracked using a LED calibration system. The absolute gain calibration comprises the LED tracking and tower by tower calibrations using \u03c0 0 s. The relative energy resolution after calibration was found to be \u03c3(E)/E = 13%/ \u221a E \u2295 8%. Comparisons between the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson using real data and simulations showed that an overall energy scale uncertainty of 2% remained after all the calibrations, and also determined that the position resolution for clusters was about 2 mm.

At low momenta, wider opening angles can prohibit the measurement of both \u03b3s in the detector. At high momenta, cluster merging increasingly inhibits the detection of distinct \u03b3 pairs.

The average pseudorapidity of the measured \u03b7 mesons is \u03b7 = 3.52. The procedure to obtain A N from the minimum bias triggered dataset is the same as that in the 4\u00d74B dataset, and where the triggers overlap in x F , the A N values are weighted together. For forward x F (x F > 0), a clear rising asymmetry is seen, ranging from 2% to 20% over the measured x F range. For backward x F (x F < 0), A N is flat and consistent with zero when averaged over x F within 1.7\u03c3 of the statistical plus systematic uncertainties. An uncorrelated systematic uncertainty is shown as bands around the points, and is found by varying the functional form of the background functions. This changes the M \u00b1 2\u03c3 range and relative r values, which affects the number of \u03b7 mesons used in the calculation of A N .

The correlated systematic uncertainty (not shown on Fig. 9, see Table III) is due to small residual relative luminosity effects in the square root formula. Figure 10 shows the measured A N for \u03b7 mesons compared to other A N measurements. The upper panel shows a comparison between \u03b7 meson and \u03c0 0 meson asymmetries in overlapping x F and similar pseudorapidity ranges at various collision energies.

The similarity between the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 asymmetries suggests that initial-state spin-momentum correlations could play a role, or a common spin-momentum correlation is present in the fragmentation of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons.",

This measurement can be used to improve constraints on the hadronization process of \u03b7 mesons in future global analyses of the \u03b7 fragmentation function. Non-zero asymmetries measured at forward x F are consistent with previous \u03c0 0 meson results within statistical uncertainties. Because the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons are produced from potentially different parton fractions, and also might have different polarized fragmentation functions due to isospin or mass differences or the presence of strange quarks in the \u03b7, this data will help to constrain the relative importance of spin-momentum correlations in the initial state polarized protons versus that of spin-momentum correlations in the fragmentation. The dependencies of the measured asymmetry on x F and p T are reasonably well described by twist-3 calculations using quark-gluon correlation functions; a quantitative comparison can be made once uncertainties become available on the calculations. With higher statistics from future data sets, a doubly differential measurement of the asymmetry binned in both x F and p T simultaneously could provide a much more stringent test of any available calculations and better constrain twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions if they turn out to be the dominant contribution.  Table IV). The purple line shows a prediction from a twist-3 calculation based on quark-gluon correlation functions [59]. ",
