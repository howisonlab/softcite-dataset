We present recent preliminary measurements of the b-quark mass and related nonperturbative parameters from moments of kinematic distributions in charmed and charmless semileptonic and radiative penguin B decays. Their determination from charmless semileptonic B decays is the first measurement in this mode. The data were collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 -collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center at a center-of-momentum energy of 10.58 GeV.",

The most accurate determinations are obtained from semileptonic decays B \u2192 X c \u2113\u03bd and B \u2192 X u \u2113\u03bd, respectively. Generally, two different approaches can be used: The hadronic state X c,u can be reconstructed either in specific exclusive modes, or inclusively by summing over all possible hadronic final states. The inclusive determinations rely on an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) in inverse powers of the b-quark mass m b [2]. At second order in the expansion, two nonperturbative parameters arise, which describe the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic moment of the b quark inside the B meson. In the kinetic scheme, they are denoted by \u00b5 2 \u03c0 and \u00b5 2 G , respectively. Two more parameters arise at third order, \u03c1 3 D and \u03c1 3 LS . In the kinetic scheme, short-and long-distance contributions are separated by a hard cutoff \u00b5 and the b-quark mass and nonperturbative parameters are given at \u00b5 = 1 GeV.",
