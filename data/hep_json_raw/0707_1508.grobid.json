Next-to-leading (NLO) models have been successful in describing inclusive hadron production using parameterized fragmentation functions (FF) for quarks and gluons. However, in order to describe identified strange particle spectra at NLO, knowledge of flavor separated FF is essential. Such FF have recently been parameterized using data by the OPAL experiment and allow for the first time to perform NLO calculation for strange baryons. In fact, comparing the STAR \u039b data with these calculations allow to put a constraint on the gluon fragmentation function. We show that the Leading-order (LO) event generator PYTHIA has to be tuned significantly to reproduce the STAR identified strange particle data. In particular, it fails to describe the observed enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratio at intermediate pT (2-6 GeV/c). In heavy-ion (HI) collisions this observable has been extensively compared with models and shows a strong dependency on collision centrality or parton density. In the HI context the observed enhancement has been explained by recent approaches in terms of parton coalescense and recombination models.",

            "text": "Perturbative QCD has proven to be successful in describing inclusive hadron production in elementary collisions. Within the theory's range of applicability, calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) have produced accurate predictions for transverse momentum spectra of inclusive hadrons at different energy scales [1,2]. With the new high statistics proton-proton data at \u221a s = 200 GeV collected by STAR, we can now extend the study to identified strange hadrons as well as strange resonances. The perturbative QCD calculation applies the factorization ansatz to calculate hadron production and relies on three ingredients. The non-perturbative parton distribution functions (PDF) are obtained by parameterizations of deep inelastic scattering data. They describe quantitatively how the partons share momentum within a nucleus. The second part, which is perturbatively calculable, consists of the parton cross-section amplitude evaluated to LO or NLO using Feynman diagrams. The third part consists of the non-perturbative Fragmentation functions (FF) obtained from e + + e \u2212 collider data using quark-tagging algorithms. These parameterized functions are sufficiently well known for fragmenting light quarks, but less well known for fragmenting gluons and heavy quarks. Recently, Send offprint requests to: mark.heinz@yale.edu Kniehl, Kramer and P\u00f6tter (KKP) have shown that FF are universal between e + + e \u2212 and p + p collisions [3].",

However, in order to achieve this agreement, they fix the initial gluon to \u039b fragmentation function (D \u039b g ) to that of the proton, then estimate that an additional scaling factor of 3 is necessary to achieve agreement with STAR data. However, this modified FF for D \u039b g also works well in describing the p +p SPS data at \u221a s = 630GeV. It therefore appears that the STAR data is a better constraint for the high z part of the gluon fragmentation function than the OPAL e + + e \u2212 data. Similar conclusions with respect to the important role of p + p collisions have been drawn elsewhere [19]. ",

This is especially important since these models are now extensively used to predict observables for the LHC-era, and therefore one should be aware of their limitations. Phenomenological LO models can be tuned to describe the data but still struggle to describe baryon production at intermediate p T . Baryon production, and in particular the baryon to meson yield ratios at intermediate p T , are one of the \"hot\" topics in current heavy-ion research at RHIC. The p + p data presented here allows us to look at the ratio in elementary collisions and check how well it is understood in a simple system. The fact that PYTHIA baryon production parameters need to be tuned quite considerably to achieve an agreement is interesting. We also showed that at the higher energies, i.e. \u221a s = 630 GeV, this difference is even larger. This is an indication that the baryon to meson effects previously observed in heavy-ion collisions are present in some form in p + p data, and that the associated physics phenomena therefore need to be explained without requiring the presence of a quark-gluon plasma.",
