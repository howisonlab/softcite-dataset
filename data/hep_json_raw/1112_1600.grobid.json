            "text": "Measurements of low-energy processes can provide indirect constraints on particles that are too heavy to be produced directly. This is particularly true for Flavour Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) processes which are highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) and can only occur through higher-order diagrams. The SM predictions for the branching fractions of the FCNC decays 1 B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 are B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (3.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22129 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (0.10 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [1]. However, contributions from new processes or new heavy particles can significantly enhance these values. For example, within Minimal Supersymmetric extensions of the SM (MSSM), in the large tan \u03b2 regime, B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) is found to be approximately proportional to tan 6 \u03b2 [2], where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral CP-even Higgs fields. The branching fractions could therefore be enhanced by orders of magnitude for large values of tan \u03b2.",
