One interesting approach is the study of decay-time distributions of neutral B-meson decays to hadronic final states mediated by loop (penguin) b \u2192 s amplitudes. As-yet undiscovered particles could contribute in the loops and cause the observables to deviate from the values expected in the Standard Model (SM) [3][4][5][6]. Studies of various B 0 decays have been performed for this reason, including decay-time-dependent amplitude analyses of B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [7,8] and B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 [9,10] transitions. Such analyses, which involve describing the variation of the decay amplitudes over the phase-space of the three-body decays, are more sensitive to interference effects than the quasi-two-body approach and are therefore particularly important when broad resonances contribute. Decay-time-dependent analyses of B s \u2192 K * 0 K 0 (K 0 K * 0 ) decay mode. The electroweak penguin diagram for the B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K 0 (K 0 K * 0 ) channel is not shown; neither are diagrams corresponding to annihilation amplitudes. In each case, the first set of final-state particles (black) leads to the K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, while the second set (blue) leads to",

The K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + and K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 final states are not flavour-specific and as such both B 0 s and B 0 s decays can contribute to each, with the corresponding amplitudes expected to be comparable in magnitude. Large interference effects and potentially large CP -violation effects are possible, making an amplitude analysis of these channels of particular interest. Example decay diagrams for contributions through the B 0 s \u2192 K + K * \u2212 (K * + K \u2212 ) and B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K 0 (K 0 K * 0 ) resonant processes are shown in figure 1. The subsequent transitions K * \u2212 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and K 0 \u2192 K 0 S (and their conjugates) lead to the K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 (K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) final state for the former (latter) processes. 1 In this article, the first Dalitz plot analysis of B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays is described. The analysis is based on a sample corresponding to 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded with the LHCb detector during 2011 and 2012. Due to the limited signal yield, and the modest effective tagging efficiency that can be achieved at hadron collider experiments, the analysis is performed without considering decay-time dependence and without separating the B 0 s JHEP06(2019)114 or B 0 s initial states (i.e. the analysis is untagged ). As such, the current analysis has limited sensitivity to CP -violation effects but provides an important basis for future studies.",

Denoting one final state by f and the other byf , the former (latter) receives contributions from the amplitudes A f and\u0100 f (Af and\u0100f ), where A and\u0100 are used to denote amplitudes for B 0 s and B 0 s decays, respectively. Therefore, the untagged decay-time-integrated density of events in the Dalitz plot corresponding to f depends on |A f | 2 and |\u0100 f | 2 , while that forf depends on |Af | 2 and |\u0100f | 2 . The untagged decay-time-integrated rate also depends on an interference term that is responsible for the difference between the decay probability at t = 0 and the decay-timeintegrated branching fraction [20][21][22]. This must be considered when results are interpreted theoretically, but is not relevant for the discussion here. In the absence of CP violation in decay A f =\u0100f and\u0100 f = Af , but there is no simple relation between A f and\u0100 f . Indeed, theoretical predictions indicate that the values of these amplitudes could be quite different [23][24][25]. Thus, the situation differs from that usually considered in Dalitz plot analyses, where the density is given by just the magnitude of a single amplitude squared.",

In such analyses the distributions for B and B decays are summed, assuming them to be identical, so that they can be fitted with a single amplitude. However, in the presence of CP -violation effects, the distribution is actually given by the incoherent sum of two contributions, as is the case here. Consequently, the fitted parameters of the amplitude model will differ from their true values by an amount that depends on the size of the CP -violation effects. Similarly, by fitting each of the two B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 Dalitz plots with a single amplitude, the results will give values that differ from the true properties of the decays by amounts that must be estimated. Detailed studies with simulated pseudoexperiments demonstrate that the fit fractions (defined in section 5) obtained by this approach are biased by relatively small amounts that can be accounted for with systematic uncertainties, but that measurements of other quantities may not be reliable. Therefore, the results of the analysis are presented in terms of fit fractions only.",

The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with significant displacement from all primary pp interaction vertices. At least one charged particle must have p T > 1.7 (1.6) GeV/c in the 2011 (2012) data and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [29] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron. It is required that the software trigger decision must have been caused entirely by tracks from the decay of the signal B candidate.",

Pseudoexperiments are generated using a model containing a set of resonances that might contribute to the B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 Dalitz plot, and signal and background yields corresponding to various possible selection requirements on the BDT output.

The responses of several figures of merit are compared with the results of this study, and that given in eq.
