The super-WIMPs are absorbed and deposit total energy in the detector, such that the experimental signatures are spectral peaks corresponding to the super-WIMP mass. Measured data are compatible with the background model, and no significant excess of super-WIMP signals are observed. We derived new upper limits on couplings of electrons with the pseudoscalar and vector bosonic super-WIMPs in the sub-keV mass region, assuming they are the dominant contributions to the dark matter density of our galaxy.",

            "text": "Since all the existing evidence only probe the gravitational interaction of DM, their non-gravitational interactions with normal matter are still elusive. Many extensions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics predict viable DM candidates. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP), axions or axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos and millicharged particles are leading candidates of DM. Searches for these leading candidates are in full swing, but an experimental verification via direct, indirect detection or production from LHC is still awaited. In the absence of a credible positive signal, direct detection experiments have ruled out a substantial portion of the favored WIMP parameter space in the GeV to TeV mass range [1,2]. The light-DM (LDM) has received more attention at both theoretical and experimental front in recent years. Bosonic super-weakly interacting particles (denoted by \u03c7) constitute another large category of LDM candidates with masses at the keV-scale [3]. These bosonic \u03c7 candidates are experimentally very interesting due to their absorption via ionization or excitation of an electron in the target-atom of detectors. The bosonic \u03c7 would deposit the energy equivalent to their rest mass in the detector. A photo-like peak with unexplained origin in the measured energy spectrum would be \"smoking gun\" signature of bosonic LDM. Point-Contact Germanium (PCGe) detectors [4] with their excellent energy resolution, sub-keV threshold, and low intrinsic radioactivity background are the best candidates to study LDM and other physics beyond the SM.",

The random-trigger is generated by a function generator at the rate of 0.1 Hz and recorded randomly due to OR-gate logic with random Ge-trigger. These random-trigger events help to measure the pedestal fluctuation and dead time of the DAQ system. The inhibit output from the preamplifier is used to veto all triggers generated during the reset of the preamplifier, including random-trigger. A schematic diagram of DAQ trigger scheme at KSNL is shown in Fig. 3. A typical low energy signal from SA and TA is depicted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. The signal of AC NaI-detector and CR veto panel are also recorded along with Ge-trigger to understand the cosmic induced background, and filtered out in the offline analysis. The known amplitude pulses are generated from the precision wave function generator and injected into the test port of the preamplifier to study the trigger efficiency and electronic behavior of the DAQ system. The DAQ software is developed in NI LabVIEW programming language which provides a user-friendly environment.",

The maximal amplitude and integrated area of the pulse are both energy related parameters. The maximal amplitude is adopted to estimate the energy of an event for its better energy resolution [4,19]. The energy resolution of nPCGe is comparable to p-type Point-Contact (pPCGe) in low energy region, but degraded in high energy region. The energy resolution of nPCGe may be enhanced by increasing the detector operating temperature, selecting the material with lower electron trap concentrations and higher gradients impurity concentrations to generate higher drift field [20,10]. Figure 6 illustrates the variation of full width at half maximum (FWHM) as a function of energy for nPCGe and pPCGe detectors. The FWHM of nPCGe degrades as energy deposition increases. The performance parameters of same modular mass nPCGe and pPCGe detectors are summarized in Table 1.  ",

The concrete of the reactor building provides 30 meters of water equivalent overburden, which eliminates most of the hadronic components of cosmic rays. A multipurpose 4\u03c0 passive shielding house with \"inner target\" detector volume of 100 cm \u00d7 80 cm \u00d7 75 cm con-sists of, from the inside out, 5 cm of oxygen-free high-conductivity copper, 25 cm of boron-loaded polyethylene, 5 cm of steel, 15 cm of lead. The shielding house is further mounted with cosmic ray (CR) veto scintillator panels. This 50-ton passive shielding house provides significant attenuation to the ambient neutron and \u03b3 backgrounds. The Ge-detector surrounded by 38.3 kg well-shaped NaI(Tl) anti-Compton (AC) detector is placed inside the inner target volume. A detailed description of shielding and the detector development at KSNL can be found in Refs. [11, 14, 18]. The data acquisition (DAQ) system in operation at KSNL is a hybrid design of digital and analog electronics. The schematic block-diagram of electronics and DAQ system is illustrated in Fig. 2. The preamplifier of PCGe is custom designed with 5 copies of a signal. Two copies of Ge-preamplifier signal are shaped with Canberra 2026 shaping amplifier (SA) at 6 \u00b5s and 12 \u00b5s with same amplification factors. The distinct behavior of self-trigger noise at different shaping time helps to suppress noise events near the threshold. One copy of Gepreamplifier is processed with SA at minimum gain to study the high energy background behavior. The timing amplifier output (TA) preserves the rise-time information. Therefore, two copies of Ge-preamplifier signal are processed with Canberra 2111 TA at \"out\" differentiate along with 10 ns integration control setting with different gains to cover a wide energy range from sub-keV to few hundreds keV.",

The intensities of K-shell X-rays increased by putting back leakage events into their own sample, as illustrated in Fig. 12. High energy \u03b3rays from ambient radioactivity produce flat electron-recoil background at low energy, which is verified by simulation and measurements ( 241 Am and 137 Cs source). Figure 13 demonstrates the flat energy spectra after correction for AC + \u2297 CR \u2212 data sample.The observed AC \u2212 \u2297CR \u2212 spectra with internal X-ray lines from cosmogenicallyinduced isotopes decays via electron capture process is shown inFig.14.The intensity of K-shell peaks decay with time and low energy L-capture lines corresponding to 65 Zn and 68 Ge behaves similar to high energy K-capture lines. The L/K-capture ratio from the same isotope has been well understood by theoretically and independent experimental measurements. Therefore, the intensities of L-shell X-ray lines are estimated from measured K-shell X-ray lines and subtracted from measured AC \u2212 \u2297 CR \u2212 spectra.
