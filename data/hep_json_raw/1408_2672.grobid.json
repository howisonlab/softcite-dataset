However, the \"double-ridge\" structure observed in the longrange two-particle correlations in high multiplicity p-Pb collisions [5,6] resembles collective features found in Pb-Pb collisions [7]. It has been suggested that some final state effects, such as parton-induced interactions [8] and strong correlations in particle production characteristic of a high density system [9,10] may be present in p-Pb collisions. In addition, an enhancement of the baryon-to-meson yield ratio at intermediate p T \u223c 3 GeV/c in high multiplicity p-Pb collisions as compared to pp collisions [11] has been observed. This effect is qualitatively similar to the enhancement observed in Pb-Pb collisions [12] that has been discussed in terms of collective flow [13], which could be presented in small systems like pp collisions [14], and/or parton recombination [15]. To discriminate between hard and soft processes contributing to the baryon and meson production, we study the \u039b/K 0 S ratio within jets and compare it to inclusive distributions measured in p-Pb and minimum-bias simulations generated by PYTHIA8 (tune 4C) [16] for pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV.",

The uncertainty of multiplicity estimation is made using energy deposition in the Pb-going side Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZNA) and determined by the so-called hybrid method [19]. Charged particles are measured using the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The ITS also provides measurement of the primary vertex. The selection of tracks used for the jet reconstruction (see [20] for details) ensures an almost uniform tracking efficiency in full azimuth. Tracks with p T > 150 MeV/c are retained in the analysis. Charged particle jets are reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm [21], with resolution parameter R = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. To remove combinatorial jets a cut on the jet area A jet [22] is applied and only jets with A jet > 0.6\u03c0R 2 are retained. The reconstructed jet p T is obtained by subtracting the energy of the underlying background according to the approach introduced in [22]:",

Feed-down of \u039b from \u039e decays in jets is corrected using the feed-down fraction of inclusive \u039b obtained from data. The systematic uncertainty of the fraction of feed-down of \u039b in jets was estimated using the difference between the PYTHIA8 simulation and the inclusive measurements at high-p T in the data. The uncertainty on jet background fluctuations is evaluated by varying the jet p T threshold by 20%.

The results are obtained for charged particle jets with R = 0.3 and p ch T,jet > 10 GeV/c. A much harder spectrum is observed for the V 0 s produced in jets, relative to the inclusive V 0 s (black points). The \u039b/K 0 S ratios in jets with R = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 are presented in Fig. 2. The results are obtained in the 0 \u2212 10% event multiplicity class with p ch T,jet > 10 GeV/c and > 20 GeV/c and compared to the inclusive V 0 in data and in PYTHIA8 [16] simulations. The ratios in jets do not depend on the jet radii and do not vary with p T,jet . At the intermediate p T (2 < p T < 4 GeV/c) the inclusive ratio in p-Pb collisions is much larger than in PYTHIAgenerated pp collisions. This is consistent with previously reported baryon-to-meson enhancement in p-Pb collisions as compared to pp collisions [11]. On the other hand, the measured \u039b/K 0 S ratio in jets is significantly smaller than that of inclusive distribution. Moreover, it is compatible with the result of the analysis applied to the PYTHIA-generated pp collisions.",

            "text": "In contrast to the inclusive distribution, the \u039b/K 0 S ratio within jets in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions does not exhibit baryon enhancement. The ratio in jets has similar magnitude and p T dependence to the ratio in low-multiplicity p-Pb collisions, and to the inclusive ratio found in pp collisions. It is also consistent with the analysis performed on the pp collisions simulated with PYTHIA8 event generator. It is plausible that the baryon enhancement may therefore be attributable to the soft (low Q 2 ) component of the collision as discussed in [25]. This result disfavors the hard-soft recombination models while it is consistent with a picture in which the value of baryon/meson ratio has two independent mechanisms: i) the expansion of the soft particles of the underlying event within a common velocity field (radial flow), and ii) the production of particles via hard parton-parton scatterings and the subsequent jet fragmentation.",
