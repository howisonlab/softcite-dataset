During Run 1, it has recorded the world's largest data sample of beauty and charm hadrons, enabling precision spectroscopy studies of such particles. Several important results obtained by LHCb, such as the discovery of the first pentaquark states and the first unambiguous determination of the Zc(4430) \u2212 as an exotic state, have dramatically increased the interest on spectroscopy of heavy hadrons. An overview of the latest LHCb results on the subject, including the discovery of four strange exotic states decaying as X \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6, is presented. LHCb has also made significant contributions to the field of B + c physics, the lowest bound state of the heavy flavor b and c quarks. A synopsis of the the latest results is given.",

[1] predicts, besides conventional qq mesons and qqq baryons, any other SU(3) color-neutral combination of quarks and gluons such as gg glueballs, qqg hybrids, qqqq tetraquarks, qqqqq pentaquarks, and so on. Experimentally, such \"exotic\" states have been hard to find, especially in the light quark sector. The situation changed in 2003, after the discovery of the narrow exotic tetraquark state, X(3872), by the Belle collaboration [2]. Since then, several other states with exotic configurations have been seen, interestingly, all involving heavy quark systems. With the first unambiguous spin-parity assignments of the X(3872) [3] and Z c (4430) \u2212 [4] states, the discovery of two pentaquark states [5], among other results, the LHCb experiment has been contributing heavily towards our understanding of these particles. In this talk we touch upon some recent results from LHCb in exotic hadron spectroscopy, as well as in the rapidly evolving field of the doubly heavy-flavored B + c meson.",

Results from several experiments [6,7,8,9,10,11] have seen disagreements on the properties of the X(4140) and higher lying states. Theoretical interpretations range from tetraquark, molecular or hybrid states, or a re-scattering phenomena, including the so-called \"cusp effect\" [12] at the D \u00b1 s D * \u2213 s production threshold.

Each of the three decay amplitudes are constructed in its corresponding helicity basis. The spinprojections of all intermediate states are summed over coherently, while the spin-projections of the final state muons are summed incoherently. The lineshapes of resonant structures are taken as relativistic Breit-Wigners with mass-dependent widths, folded with the corresponding angular-momentum barrier factor. For non-resonant components, the lineshape is taken just as the angular-momentum barrier factor. The transition matrix element depends on six kinematic variables describing the full decay chain, and the angular analysis fits to the joint six-dimensional differential rate. )   Figure 1 shows the results of the default amplitude fit, projected onto the \"K * \" and \"X\" invariant mass variables (the exotic Z c contributions are found to not dominate). Although the overall m(\u03c6K) distribution in Fig. 1a appears flat, a rich spectrum of K * + \u2192 \u03c6K + resonances are found in the angular distributions. The near-threshold J/\u03c8 \u03c6 structure in Fig. 1b is found to be consistent with previous world data on X(4140) in the mass, while the width is found to be larger. A nearby second state consistent with the X(4272) found by the CDF collaboration [15] is seen, and both states prefer spin-parity assignments J P = 1 + . The higher m(J/\u03c8 \u03c6) region is also found to require two J P = 0 + resonances, X(4500) and X(4700). The significances of all four exotic states are found to exceed 5 \u03c3.",

Model-independent confirmation of exotic activity in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 One of the important sources of systematic uncertainties in the exotic states searches is the often poorly known spectrum of conventional hadronic resonances. For pentaquarks in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 [5], these comprise the exited \u039b * J \u2192 pK \u2212 states of spin-J. To circumvent this problem, the LHCb adopted a model-independent method [19] first proposed by the BaBar collaboration in the context of Z c (4430) \u2212 searches [20]. The underlying principle is that if the highest spin of the the contributing \u039b * J states is J max , then the maximal power of x = cos \u03b8 pK in the differential decay rate is given by the Legendre polynomial, P lmax (x), of order l max = 2J max + 1. Here \u03b8 pK is the helicity angle of the daughter kaon in the mother \u039b * J rest-frame. Typically, physical \u039b * J resonances occurring at a given m(pK) mass will have a limited ranges of l max as depicted in Fig. 4a: resonances of higher spins occur at higher masses, as demarcated by the red and blue lines.",

With a significant production and acceptance rate of B + c mesons inside LHCb detector, several precision or first measurements of its mass, lifetime and decay modes have been made. The interesting problem of whether the weak annihilation process bc \u2192 W + in B + c 3-body charmless decays, can be enhanced from New Physics contributions has also being probed.
