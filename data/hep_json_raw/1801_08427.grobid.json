This study is performed using proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, in data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb \u22121 . New substructure techniques, including the novel use of energy correlation functions, are utilized to identify the decay products of the top quark. With no significant deviations observed from predictions of the standard model, limits are placed on the production of new heavy bosons coupling to dark matter particles. For a scenario with purely vector-like or purely axial-vector-like flavor changing neutral currents, mediator masses between 0.20 and 1.75 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, given a sufficiently small dark matter mass. Scalar resonances decaying into a top quark and a dark matter fermion are excluded for masses below 3.4 TeV, assuming a dark matter mass of 100 GeV.",

            "text": "The existence of dark matter (DM) can be inferred through astrophysical observations of its gravitational interactions [1][2][3]. The nature of DM has remained elusive, although it is widely believed that it may have a particle physics origin. Multiple models of new physics predict the existence of weakly interacting, neutral, massive particles that provide excellent sources of DM candidates. Searches for DM are often carried out through direct searches for interactions between cosmic DM particles and detectors (e.g., via nuclear recoil [4]), or for particles produced in the annihilation or decay of relic DM particles [5]. The CERN LHC presents a unique opportunity to produce DM particles as well as study them. In this paper, we describe a search for events where DM particles are produced in association with a top quark (hereafter called \"monotop\"), originally proposed in ref. [6]. The associated production of a top quark and invisible particles is heavily suppressed in the standard model (SM). Therefore, this signature can be used to probe the production of DM particles via a flavor-violating mechanism, which most DM models do not consider [2].",

One model involves a flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC), where a top quark is produced in association with a vector boson that has flavor-changing couplings to quarks and can decay to a pair of DM particles. This is referred to in this paper as the \"nonresonant\" mode. In a simplified model approach, the interaction terms of the effective Lagrangian [6,10,11] describing nonresonant monotop production are given by: (1.1) where \"h.c.\" refers to the Hermitian conjugate of the preceding terms in the Lagrangian. The heavy mediator is denoted V, and \u03c7 is the DM particle, assumed to be a Dirac fermion. The couplings g V \u03c7 and g A \u03c7 are respectively the vector-and axial vector-couplings between \u03c7 and V. In the quark-V interaction terms, it is understood that q u and q d represent three generations of up-and down-type quarks, respectively. Correspondingly, g V u and g A u are 3 \u00d7 3 flavor matrices that determine the vector-and axial vector-couplings between V and u, c, and top quarks. It is through the off-diagonal elements of these matrices that monotop production becomes possible. To preserve SU(2) L symmetry, analogous downtype couplings g V d and g A d must be introduced, and the following must be satisfied [6]:",

[12], is a multipurpose apparatus designed to study high-transverse momentum (p T ) processes in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A superconducting solenoid occupies its central region, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T parallel to the beam direction. Charged particle trajectories are measured using silicon pixel and strip trackers that cover a pseudorapidity region of |\u03b7| < 2.5. A lead tungstate (PbWO 4 ) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) surround the tracking volume and extend to |\u03b7| < 3. The steel and quartz-fiber forward Cherenkov hadron calorimeter extends the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5. The muon system consists of gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid and covers |\u03b7| < 2.4. The return yoke carries a 2 T return field from the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system is designed to select events in less than 4 \u00b5s, using information from the calorimeters and muon detectors. The high-level trigger-processor farm reduces the event rate to several hundred Hz. The particle-flow (PF) event algorithm [13] reconstructs and identifies each individual particle through an optimized combination of information from the different elements of the CMS detector. The energy of a photon is obtained directly from the ECAL measurement, corrected for effects from neglecting signals close to the detector noise level (often termed zero-suppression). The energy of an electron is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of a muon is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of a charged hadron is determined from a combination of its momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of a neutral hadron is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.",

The final state particles of the hadronization of a light quark or gluon are reconstructed as a jet. A standard jet-clustering algorithm at CMS is the anti-k T algorithm [29] with a distance parameter of 0.4 (AK4). If a hadronically decaying top quark is highly Lorentz-boosted, reconstructing the three daughter quarks separately becomes difficult, as the resulting jets tend to overlap in the detector. Accordingly, to identify such signatures, we define CA15 jets as objects that are clustered from PF candidates using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [30] with a distance parameter of 1.5. To reduce the impact of particles arising from pileup, weights calculated with the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [31] are applied to the PF candidates. Calibrations derived from data are then applied to correct the absolute scale of the jet energy [32]. The CA15 jets must -4 -",

At 50% signal efficiency, the BDT background acceptance is 4.7%, compared to 6.9% for groomed \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 , which is commonly used for t tagging. The distributions in BDT output and m SD in MC and data are shown in figure 3, using control data enriched either in genuine top quark jets from tt production or in q/g jets. The selection of these control data is described in section 5.1. In all distributions, a slight disagreement between data and simulation is observed. This is accounted for by the use of data-driven estimates and scale factors, as described in section 5.  Figure 2. Performance of BDT tagging of top quark and q/g jets. The left figure shows the BDT output in both types of jets. The right figure shows the rate of misidentifying a q/g jet as a function of the efficiency of selecting top jets.

As the branching fraction of the Z boson to electrons and muons is approximately a factor of three smaller than to neutrinos, the resulting constraint on the Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background from the dilepton CRs is limited by the statistical uncertainty in the dilepton control samples at large values of p recoil T .",

Then, variations due to the parton shower algorithm, higher-order corrections, and experimental effects are propagated to the efficiency measurement. This is done for the loose and tight categories independently. The final uncertainty for tagging CA15 jets from a top quark decay is found to be 6% in both categories. Similarly, the uncertainty in mistagging a q/g jet is measured by computing the efficiency in a Z(\u00b5\u00b5)+jets selection. The mistag uncertainty is 7%. The CRs used to compute these efficiencies and uncertainties are those shown in figure 3. The uncertainties corresponding to the m SD and BDT distributions are only applied to the signal and minorbackground predictions.

Expected and observed limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set using the asymptotic approximation [57] of the CL s criterion [58,59] with a profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic, in which systematic uncertainties are modeled as nuisance parameters. Figure 9 shows the exclusion as a function of the mediator mass m V and DM particle mass m \u03c7 , assuming g V q = 0.25, g V \u03c7 = 1, and g A q = g A \u03c7 = 0. At m \u03c7 < 100 GeV, we observe that the result is roughly independent of m \u03c7 , and the range 0.2 < m V < 1.75 TeV is excluded. This can be compared to an expected exclusion of 0.2 < m V < 1.78 TeV. At very high m \u03c7 (i.e., 2m \u03c7 m V ), the parameter space is not excluded because the available phase space for the decay to DM decreases in this region. Figure 10 shows an analogous result, obtained with the assumptions g A q = 0.25, g A \u03c7 = 1, and   to an expected exclusion of 0.2 < m V < 1.78 TeV. However, as m \u03c7 approaches the off-shell region, the shape of the exclusion is modified owing to the coupling structure. In addition to considering the dependence on the DM and mediator masses, limits are calculated as a function of the couplings between DM and the mediator, and between quarks and the mediator. We fix m \u03c7 = 1 GeV and show the 95% CL exclusion in the planes spanned by the couplings and m V , assuming vector-(figure 11) and axial-only couplings (figure 12). Very little difference is observed between the two coupling schemes. At low mediator and DM masses, coupling combinations as small as Figure 20 in appendix A shows the maximum excluded m V as a function of g V \u03c7 and g V q . Figure 13 shows the results in the resonant model interpretation. The DM mass is fixed at m \u03c8 = 100 GeV, and the couplings are assumed to be a q = b q = 0.1 and a \u03c8 = b \u03c8 = 0.2.

Shaded bands around the central predictions correspond to independent variations of the nominal factorization and renormalization scale H T /2 by factors of 2 and 1/2.
