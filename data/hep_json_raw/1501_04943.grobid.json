The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb \u22121 and 20.3 fb \u22121 at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV respectively. All combinations of leptonic (\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd with = e, \u00b5) and hadronic (\u03c4 \u2192 hadrons \u03bd) tau decays are considered. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.5 (3.4) standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the direct coupling of the recently discovered Higgs boson to fermions. The measured signal strength, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, of \u00b5 = 1.43 +0.43   \u22120.37 is consistent with the predicted Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.",

With the discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 125 GeV by the ATLAS [8] and CMS [9] collaborations, an important milestone has been reached. More precise measurements of the properties of the discovered particle [10,11] as well as tests of the spin-parity quantum numbers [12][13][14] continue to be consistent with the predictions for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson.",

To establish the mass generation mechanism for fermions as implemented in the SM, it is of prime importance to demonstrate the direct coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions and the proportionality of its strength to mass [15]. The most promising candidate decay modes are the decays into tau leptons, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , and bottom quarks (b-quarks), H \u2192 bb. Due to the high background, the search for decays to bb is restricted to Higgs bosons produced in modes which have a more distinct signature but a lower cross-section, such as H production with an associated vector boson. The smaller rate of these processes in the presence of still large background makes their detection challenging. More favourable signal-to-background conditions are expected for H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays. Recently, the CMS Collaboration published evidence for H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays at a significance in terms of standard deviations of 3.2\u03c3 [16], and an excess corresponding to a significance of 2.1\u03c3 in the search for H \u2192 bb decays [17]. The combination of channels provides evidence for fermionic couplings with a significance of 3.8\u03c3 [18]. The yield of events in the search for H \u2192 bb decays observed by the ATLAS Collaboration has a signal significance of 1.4\u03c3 [19]. The Tevatron experiments have observed an excess corresponding to 2.8\u03c3 in the H \u2192 bb search [20].",

It provides precise position and momentum measurements for charged particles and allows efficient identification of jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ID is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and is surrounded by high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic calorimeters which cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator tile calorimeter provides hadronic energy measurements in the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). In the forward regions (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9), the system is complemented by two end-cap calorimeters using LAr as active material and copper or tungsten as absorbers. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting eight-coil toroids, a system of tracking chambers, and detectors for triggering. The deflection of muons is measured within |\u03b7| < 2.7 by three layers of precision drift tubes, and cathode strip chambers in the innermost layer for |\u03b7| > 2.0. The trigger chambers consist of resistive plate chambers in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.05) and thin-gap chambers in the end-cap regions (1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4).",

In this calculation, the effects of finite masses of the top and bottom quarks [64,65] are included and dynamical renormalisation and factorisation scales, \u00b5 R , \u00b5 F = m 2 H + p 2 T , are used. A reweighting is performed separately for events with no more than one jet at particle level and for events with two or more jets. In the latter case, the Higgs boson p T spectrum is reweighted to match the MinLo HJJ predictions [66]. The reweighting is derived such that the inclusive Higgs boson p T spectrum and the p T spectrum of events with at least two jets match the HRes2.1 and MinLo HJJ predictions respectively, and that the jet multiplicities are in agreement with (N)NLO calculations from JetVHeto [67][68][69].",

In this approach, essential features such as the modelling of the kinematics of the produced boson, the modelling of the hadronic activity of the event (jets and underlying event) as well as contributions from pile-up are taken from data. Thereby the dependence on the simulation is minimised and only the \u03c4 decays and the detector response to the tau-lepton decay products are based on simulation. By requiring two isolated, high-energy muons with opposite charge and a dimuon invariant mass m \u00b5\u00b5 > 40 GeV, Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events can be selected from the data with high efficiency and purity. To replace the muons in the selected events, all tracks associated with the muons are removed and calorimeter cell energies associated with the muons are corrected by subtracting the corresponding energy depositions in a single simulated Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 event with the same kinematics. Finally, both the track information and the calorimeter cell energies from a simulated Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay are",

Background contributions from jets that are misidentified as hadronically decaying taus (fake backgrounds) are estimated by using either a fake-factor method or samples of non-isolated \u03c4 had candidates. Likewise, samples of non-isolated leptons are used to estimate fake-lepton contributions from jets or hadronically decaying taus and leptons from other sources, such as heavy-quark decays. 8 Contributions from various other physics processes with leptons and/or \u03c4 had candidates in the final state are estimated using the simulation, normalised to the theoretical cross sections, as given in table 1. A more detailed discussion of the estimation of the various background components in the different channels is given in the following.",

It has been shown in other ATLAS analyses that existing Z+jets Monte Carlo simulation needs to be reweighted to model data correctly [102][103][104]. Additionally, it is not possible to select a sufficiently pure and signal-free Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 control sample from data to model the background in the signal region. Therefore this background is estimated using embedded data, as described in section 3. This procedure was extensively validated using both data and simulation. To validate the subtraction procedure of the muon cell energies and tracks from data and the subsequent embedding of the corresponding information from simulation, the muons in Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events are replaced by simulated muons. The calorimeter isolation energy in a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 around the muons from data before and after embedding is compared in figure 4(a). Good agreement is found, which indicates that no deterioration (e.g. possible energy biases) in the muon environment is introduced. Another important test validates the embedding of more complex Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, which can only be performed in the simulation. To achieve a meaningful validation, the same MC generator with identical settings was used to simulate both the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. The sample of embedded events is corrected for the bias due to the trigger, reconstruction and acceptance of the original muons. These corrections are determined from data as a function of p \u00b5 T and \u03b7(\u00b5), and allow the acceptance of the original selection to be corrected. The tau decay products are treated like any other objects obtained from the simulation, with one -20 -  , in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had final state, for simulated Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, compared to the one obtained from simulated Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events after tau embedding. The ratios of the values before and after the embedding and between the embedded Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events are given in (a) and (b) respectively. The errors in (a) and (b) on the ratios (points) represent the statistical uncertainties, while the systematic uncertainties are indicated by the hatched bands in (b). The shaded bands represent the statistical uncertainties from the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 data events in (a) and from the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 simulation in (b).",

The fake factor is defined as the ratio of the number of jets identified as medium \u03c4 had candidates to the number satisfying the loose, but not the medium, criteria. Since the fake factor depends on the type of parton initiating the jet and on the p T of the jet, it is determined as a function of p T separately for samples enriched in quark-and gluon-initiated jets. In addition, the fake factor is found to be different for 1-track and 3-track candidates. Three different, quark-jet dominated samples are used separately for the W +jets, tt and Z+jets background components. They are defined by selecting the high-m T region (m T > 70 GeV), by inverting the b-jet veto and by requiring two leptons with an invariant mass consistent with m Z (80 GeV < m < 100 GeV) respectively. In addition, a multijet sample dominated by gluon-initiated jets is selected by relaxing the lepton identification and requiring it to satisfy the loose identification criteria. The derived fake factors are found to vary from 0.124 (0.082) for p T = 20 GeV to 0.088 (0.038) for p T = 150 GeV for 1-track (3-track) candidates in the VBF category. The corresponding values for the boosted category are 0.146 (0.084) for p T = 20 GeV and 0.057 (0.033) for p T = 150 GeV. To obtain the fake-background estimate for the VBF and boosted signal regions, these factors are then applied, weighted by the expected relative W +jets, Z+jets, multijet, and tt fractions, to the events in regions defined by applying the selections of the corresponding signal region, except that the \u03c4 had candidate is required to pass the loose and to fail the medium \u03c4 had identification.

It is important to investigate the behaviour of the global fit and in particular to investigate how far the nuisance parameters are pulled away from their nominal values and how well their uncertainties are constrained. Furthermore, it is important to understand which systematic uncertainties have the most impact on the final result. For this purpose a ranking of nuisance parameters is introduced. For each parameter, the fit is performed again with the parameter fixed to its fitted value shifted up or down by its fitted uncertainty, with all the other parameters allowed to vary. The ranking obtained for those nuisance parameters contributing most to the uncertainty on the signal strength is shown in figure 8 for the combined fit of the three channels at the two centre-of-mass energies. The parameters contributing most are those related to the jet energy scale, the normalisation uncertainties for Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and top-quark events, and the tau energy scale. The uncertainties on the jet energy scale are decomposed into several uncorrelated components (among others: \u03b7 intercalibration of different calorimeter regions, jet energy response, and response to jets of different flavour). In addition, theoretical uncertainties on the branching ratio BR (H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) are found to have a significant impact.

A total cross section times branching ratio for H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 with m H = 125 GeV can also be measured. The central value is obtained from the product of the measured \u00b5 and the predicted cross section used to define it. The uncertainties are similarly obtained by scaling the uncertainties on \u00b5 by the predicted cross section, noting that theoretical uncertainties on the inclusive cross section cancel between \u00b5 and the predicted cross section and thus are not included for the production processes under consideration. These include the uncertainties on the inclusive cross section due to the QCD scale and the PDF choice as well as the uncertainty on the branching ratio H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ; however, theoretical uncertainties on the acceptance of the signal regions from the QCD scale and PDF choice are retained, along with the uncertainties due to underlying event and parton shower, and the electroweak correction on VBF production. Table 14 gives the measured values for the total cross section at 7 and at 8 TeV, as well as the measured values at 8 TeV for gluon fusion production and for VBF and V H production separately.  Figure 13. Likelihood contours for the combination of all channels in the (\u00b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 ggF , \u00b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 VBF+VH ) plane. The signal strength \u00b5 is the ratio of the measured signal yield to the Standard Model expectation, for each production mode. The 68% and 95% CL contours are shown as dashed and solid lines respectively, for m H = 125.36 GeV. The SM expectation is shown by a filled plus symbol, and the best fit to the data is shown as a star. ",

While the multivariate analysis performs a fit to the BDT output distribution, the cut-based analysis relies on a fit to the \u03c4 \u03c4 invariant mass distribution. The \u03c4 \u03c4 invariant mass is calculated using the missing mass calculator, as described in section 4.3. The analysis is not designed to be sensitive to a specific value of the Higgs boson mass m H .

These subcategories target events produced via the same production mode, but select different phase-space regions with different signal-to-background ratios. With this strategy the most sensitive subcategories have a small number of events, but a high signal-to-background ratio.

In all channels, the event categorisation is designed by splitting events first according to the production mode, either VBF-like or boosted ggF-like, and second, for the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channels, by signal-to-background ratio. The events accepted in the VBF categories pass a common selection that requires the presence of the two forward jets distinctive of VBF production. In the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel, tight and loose VBF subcategories are defined, via cuts on the mass of the dijet system, m jj , and p H T , the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson candidate. In the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel, the variables used to select the most sensitive categories for both production modes are p H T and the separation \u2206R(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 ) between the two \u03c4 had candidates. In the VBF-like events, correlations between the invariant mass of the selected jets m jj and \u2206\u03b7 jj of the jets characteristic of VBF production are also used. The subcategory with the highest purity is the VBF high-p H T subcategory, where tight cuts on p H T and \u2206R(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 ) reject almost all non-resonant background sources. The other two VBF-like subcategories are distinguished by a different signal-to-background ratio due to a tighter selection applied to the forward jets. For the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel, boosted subcategories are also defined. The division is based on the same cuts on p H T and \u2206R(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 ) as used in the VBF high-p H T category. Events with low transverse momentum are not used in any category because in such events the signal cannot be effectively distinguished from background channels. The proportion of the signal yield produced via VBF in the VBFlike subcategories is found to be 80% in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 lep channel, between 67% and 85% in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel and between 58% and 78% in the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel.",
