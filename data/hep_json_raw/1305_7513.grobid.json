            "text": "Since its original postulation by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, the neutrino has played a prominent role in our understanding of nuclear and particle physics. In the intervening 80 years, scientists have detected and measured neutrinos from a variety of sources, both man made and natural. Underlying all of these observations, and any inferences we may have made from them, is an understanding of how neutrinos interact with matter. Knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections is an important and necessary ingredient in any neutrino measurement. With the advent of new precision experiments, the demands on our understanding of neutrino interactions is becoming even greater. The purpose of this article is to survey our current knowledge of neutrino cross sections across all known energy scales: from the very lowest energies to the highest that we hope to observe. The article covers a wide range of neutrino interactions including coherent scattering, neutrino capture, inverse beta decay, low-energy nuclear interactions, quasielastic scattering, resonant pion production, kaon production, deep inelastic scattering, and ultrahigh energy interactions. Strong emphasis is placed on experimental data whenever such measurements are available.",

            "text": "The investigation into the basic properties of the particle known as the neutrino has been a particularly strong and active area of research within nuclear and particle physics. Research conducted over the latter half of the 20th century has revealed, for example, that neutrinos can no longer be considered as massless particles in the standard model, representing perhaps the first significant alteration to the theory. Moving into the 21st century, neutrino research continues to expand in new directions. Researchers further investigate the nature of the neutrino mass or explore whether neutrinos can help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. At the heart of many of these experiments is the need for neutrinos to interact with other standard model particles. An understanding of these basic interaction cross sections is often an understated but truly essential element of any experimental neutrino program.",

            "text": "The known reactions of neutrinos with matter fall completely within the purview of the standard model of particle physics. The model of electroweak interactions govern what those reactions should be, with radiative corrections that can be accurately calculated to many orders. As such, our goal in this review is essentially already complete: we would simply write down the electroweak Lagrangian and we would be finished. Of course, in practice this is very far from the truth. As with many other disciplines, many factors compound our simple description, including unclear initial-state conditions, subtlebut-important nuclear corrections, final-state interactions, and other effects. One quickly finds that theoretical approximations which work well in one particular energy regime completely break down elsewhere. Even the language used in describing certain processes in one context may seem completely foreign in another. Previous neutrino experiments could avoid this issue by virtue of the energy range in which they operated; now, however, more experiments find themselves ''crossing boundaries'' between different energy regimes. Thus, the need for understanding neutrino cross sections across many decades of energy is becoming more imperative. To summarize our current collective understanding, this work provides a review of neutrino cross sections across all explored energy scales. The range of energies covered, as well as their relevance to various neutrino sources, is highlighted in Fig. 1. We first establish the formalism of neutrino interactions by considering the simplest case of neutrino-electron scattering. Our focus will then shift to neutrino interaction cross sections at low (1-100 MeV), intermediate (0.1-20 GeV), high (20-500 GeV), and ultrahigh (0.5 TeV-1 EeV) energies, emphasizing our current theoretical and experimental understanding of the processes involved. Though it may be tempting to interpret these delineations as hard and absolute, they are only approximate in nature, meant as a guide for the reader.",

As a purely leptonic interaction, neutrino-lepton scattering allows us to establish the formalism and terminology used through the paper, without introducing some of the complexity that often accompanies neutrino-nuclear scattering. The general form of the twobody scattering process is governed by the dynamics of the process encoded in the matrix elements and the phase space available in the interaction. Figure 2 shows the tree-level diagram of a neutrino-lepton charged current interaction, known as inverse muon decay. A muon neutrino with fourmomentum p (aligned along the z direction) scatters in this example with an electron with four-momentum p e , which is at rest in the laboratory frame. This produces an outgoing muon with four-momentum k and a scattered electron neutrino with four-momentum k e . In the laboratory frame, the components of these quantities can be written as p \u00bc \u00f0E ;p \u00de; k \u00bc \u00f0E ;k \u00de; p e \u00bc \u00f0m e ; 0\u00de; k e \u00bc \u00f0E e ;k e \u00de:",

At tree level, knowing G F (and and M Z ) it is possible to exactly predict the value of sin 2 W and test this prediction against the relevant cross section measurements. However, once one introduces one-loop radiative contributions, dependencies on the top and Higgs masses are also introduced. The size of these corrections depends partially on the choice of the normalization scheme. The two commonly used renormalization schemes include the Sirlin on-shell model (Sirlin, 1980) and the modified minimal subtraction scheme . In the latter method, the Weinberg angle is defined by M W and M Z at some arbitrary renormalized mass scale , which is typically set to the electroweak scale",

Beta decay transitions also play a pivotal role in the evaluation of neutrino cross sections for a variety of other target nuclei. Nuclei which relate back to superallowed nuclear transitions stand as one excellent example. Isotopes that undergo superallowed Fermi transitions (0 \u00fe ! 0 \u00fe ) provide the best test of the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis (Gerstein and Zeldovich, 1956;Feynman and Gell-Mann, 1958) and, if one includes measurements of the muon lifetime, the most accurate measurements of the quark mixing matrix element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix V ud (Hardy and Towner, 1999). Typically, the value for V ud can be extracted by looking at the combination of the statistical rate function (F ) and the partial half-life (t) of a given superallowed transition.

Finally, though not least, both allowed and forbidden AE decays often allow a direct measure of the Gamow-Teller contribution to the total cross section. Comparisons of neutrino reactions on 37 Cl and the decay process 37 Ca\u00f0 \u00fe \u00de 37 K are prime example of this last constraint technique (Aufderheide et al., 1994).",

There exist two prominent methods for calculating such cross sections. The first method, sometimes referred to in the literature as the elementary-particle treatment (EPT) or at times the standard nuclear physics approach, was first introduced by Fujii and Yamaguchi (1964) and Kim and Primakoff (1965). The technique treats the relevant nuclei as fundamental particles with assigned quantum numbers. A transition matrix element for a given process is parametrized in terms of the nuclear form factors solely based on the transformation properties of the nuclear states, which in turn are constrained from complementary experimental data. Such a technique provides a robust method for calculating d scattering. Typically one divides the problem into two parts; the onebody impulse approximation terms and two-body exchange currents acting on the appropriate nuclear wave functions. In general, the calculation of these two-body currents presents the most difficulty in terms of verification. However, data gathered from n \u00fe p ! d \u00fe scattering provide one means of constraining any terms which may arise in d scattering. An additional means of verification, as discussed previously, involves the reproduction of the experimental tritium beta decay width, which is very precisely measured.",

EFT techniques make use of the gap between the long-wavelength and short-range properties of nuclear interactions. Calculations separate the long-wavelength behavior of the interaction, which can be readily calculated, while absorbing the omitted degrees of freedom into effective operators which are expanded in powers of some cutoff momentum. Such effective operators can then be related directly to some observable or constraint that fixes the expansion. In the case of d scattering, the expansion is often carried out as an expansion of the pion mass q=m . EFT separates the two-body current process such that it is dependent on one single parameter, referred to in the literature as L 1;A . This low-energy constant can be experimentally constrained, and in doing so provides an overall regularization for the entire cross section. Comparisons between these two different methods agree to within 1%-2% for energies relevant for solar neutrinos (< 20 MeV) (Nakamura et al., 2001;Mosconi, Ricci, and Truhlik, 2006;Mosconi et al., 2007). In general, the EFT approach has been extremely successful in providing a solid prediction of the deuterium cross section, and central to the reduction in the theoretical uncertainties associated with the reaction (Adelberger et al., 2010). Given the precision of such cross sections, one must often include radiative corrections (Towner, 1998;Beacom and Parke, 2001;Kurylov, Ramsey-Musolf, and Vogel, 2002).",

Unlike its decay counterpart, \u00f0p; n\u00de scattering does not suffer from being limited to a particular momentum band; in principle, a wider band is accessible via this channel. Since the processes involved for \u00f0p; n\u00de scattering are essentially the same as those for the weak interaction in general, one can obtain an empirical evaluation of the Fermi and Gamow-Teller strengths for a given nucleus. This is particularly relevant for \u00f0p; n\u00de reactions at high incident energies and forward angles, where the direct reaction mechanism dominates. The use of \u00f0p; n\u00de reactions is particularly favorable for studying weak interaction matrix elements for a number of reasons. The reaction is naturally spin selective and spin sensitive over a wide range of beam energies. Furthermore, small angle scattering is relatively easy to prove experimentally. This approach was first explored empirically by Goodman and others (Goodman et al., 1980;Watson et al., 1985) and later expanded in a seminal paper by Taddeucci et al. (1987). Provided that \u00f0p; n\u00de forward scattering data on a particular nucleus are available, one can reduce the uncertainties on the corresponding neutrino cross section considerably. Data on \u00f0p; n\u00de scattering have been taken for a variety of nuclear targets, with particular focus on isotopes relevant for solar neutrino physics and stellar astrophysics. An example of the latter would be the treatment of the neutrino cross section at low energies for 71 Ga (Haxton, 1998).",

Inverse beta decay and neutrino absorption are still, after 60 years, the main reaction channels used for detecting reactor and solar neutrinos. Within the context of studying neutrino cross sections, however, the experimental data are somewhat limited. Most studies of neutrino interactions on protons (hydrogen) come from reactor experiments, whereby neutrinos are produced from the fission of 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and 238 U. These experiments include Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL)-Grenoble (Kwon et al., 1981;Hoummada et al., 1995), 7 G\u00f6sgen (Zacek et al., 1986, ROVNO (Kuvshinnikov et al., 1991), Krasnoyarsk (Vidyakin et al., 1987), and Bugey (Declais et al., 1994;Achkar et al., 1995), the latter of which had the most precise determination of the cross section.

Reactor experiments, including Savannah River (Reines, Gurr, and Sobel, 1976), ROVNO (Vershinsky et al., 1991), Krasnoyarsk (Kozlov et al., 2000), and Bugey Riley et al. (1999), have reported cross sections per fission for both charged current ( \" e d ! e \u00fe nn) and neutral-current ( \" e d ! \" e pn) reactions (see Table V). Given the ever-increasing precision gained by large scale solar experiments, however, there has been greater urgency to improve upon the AE20% accuracy on the cross section amplitude achieved by direct beam measurements. Indirect constraints on the e d cross section have therefore emerged, particularly within the context of effective field theory. As discussed in the previous section, the main uncertainty in the neutrino-deuterium cross section can be encapsulated in a single common isovector axial two-body current parameter L 1;A . Constraints on L 1;A come from a variety of experimental probes. There are direct extractions, such as from solar neutrino experiments and reactor measurements, as highlighted above. Constraints can also be extracted from the lifetime of tritium beta decay, muon capture on deuterium, and helio-seismology. These methods were recently summarized by Butler, Chen, and Vogel (2002) and are reproduced in Table VI.",

The spin parity of the ground state of 12 C is J \u00bc 0 \u00fe , T \u00bc 0, while for the final state it is J \u00bc 1 \u00fe , T \u00bc1. As such, there exists both an isospin and spin flip in the interaction, the former involving the isovector components of the reaction, while the latter invoking the axial-vector components. Therefore, both vector and axial-vector components contribute strongly to the interaction. The isovector components are well constrained by electron scattering data. Since the final state of the nucleus is also well defined, the axial form factors can be equally constrained by looking at the decay of 12 N, as well as the muon capture on 12 C. Although these constraints occur at a specific momentum transfer, they provide almost all necessary information to calculate the cross section. The exclusive reaction is also optimal from an experimental perspective. The ground state of 12 N beta decays to the ground state of 12 C with a half-life of 11 ms; the emitted secondary electron providing a well-defined tag for event identification.

The neutrino beam in both experimental facilities is provided from proton beam stops. High-energy proton collisions on a fixed target produce a large \u00fe flux which is subsequently stopped and allowed to decay. The majority of low-energy neutrinos are produced from the decay at rest from stopped \u00fe and \u00fe , providing a well-characterized neutrino beam with energies below 50 MeV. 8 The KARMEN experiment at the ISIS facility additionally benefited from a well-defined proton beam structure, which allowed efficient tagging of neutrino events against cosmic ray backgrounds. The main uncertainty affecting these cross section measurements stems primarily from the knowledge of the pion flux produced in the protontarget interactions. Table VII summarizes the measurements to date on the inclusive and exclusive reactions on 12 C at low energies. Estimates of the cross sections using a variety of different techniques (shell model, RPA, QRPA, effective particle theory) demonstrate the robustness of the calculations. Some disagreement can be seen in the inclusive channels; this disagreement is to be expected since the final state is not as well defined as in the exclusive channels. More recent predictions employing extensive shell model calculations appear to show better agreement with the experimental data.

With that said, we acknowledge that the approach is also limited, as it fails to incorporate the nucleus as a whole. Such departmentalization is part of the reason why the spheres of low-energy and high-energy physics appear so disjointed in both approach and terminology.

In the case of charged current neutrino scattering, this process is referred to as ''quasielastic scattering'' and is a mechanism we first alluded to in Sec. IV.D, whereas for neutral-current scattering this is traditionally referred to as ''elastic scattering.'' Resonance production: Neutrinos can excite the target nucleon to a resonance state. The resultant baryonic resonance (\u00c1, N \u00c3 ) decays to a variety of possible mesonic final states producing combinations of nucleons and mesons. Deep inelastic scattering: Given enough energy, the neutrino can resolve the individual quark constituents of the nucleon. This is called deep inelastic scattering and manifests in the creation of a hadronic shower. As a result of these competing processes, the products of neutrino interactions include a variety of final states ranging from the emission of nucleons to more complex final states including pions, kaons, and collections of mesons (Fig. 8). This energy regime is often referred to as the ''transition region'' because it corresponds to the boundary between quasielastic scattering (in which the target is a nucleon) on the one end and deep inelastic scattering (in which the target is the constituent parton inside the nucleon) on the other. Historically, adequate theoretical descriptions of quasielastic, resonance-mediated, and deep inelastic scattering have been formulated, however, there is no uniform description which globally describes the transition between these processes or how they should be combined. Moreover, the full extent to which nuclear effects impact this region is a topic that has only recently been appreciated. Therefore, in this section, we focus on what is currently known, both experimentally and theoretically, about each of the exclusive final-state processes that participate in this region. To start, Fig. 9 summarizes the existing measurements of CC neutrino and antineutrino cross sections across this intermediate energy range N ! \u00c0 X;",

First, the total cross sections approaches a linear dependence on neutrino energy. This scaling behavior is a prediction of the quark parton model (Feynman, 1969), a topic we return to later, and is expected if pointlike scattering off quarks dominates the scattering mechanism, for example, in the case of deep inelastic scattering. Such assumptions break down, of course, at lower neutrino energies (i.e., lower momentum transfers). Second, the neutrino cross sections at the lower energy end of this region are not typically as well measured as their highenergy counterparts. This is generally due to the lack of high statistics data historically available in this energy range and the challenges that arise when trying to describe all of the various underlying physical processes that can participate in this region. Third, antineutrino cross sections are typically less well measured than their neutrino counterparts. This is generally due to lower statistics and larger background contamination present in that case.",

These measurements were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s using either bubble chamber or spark chamber detectors and represent a large fraction of the data presented in the summary plots we show. Over the years, interest in this energy region waned as efforts migrated to higher energies to yield larger event samples and the focus centered on measurement of electroweak parameters (sin 2 W ) and structure functions in the deep inelastic scattering region. With the discovery of neutrino oscillations and the advent of higher intensity neutrino beams, however, this situation has been rapidly changing. The processes discussed here are important because they form some of the dominant signal and background channels for experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. This is especially true for experiments that use atmospheric or accelerator-based sources of neutrinos.  . Also shown are the various contributing processes that will be investigated in the remaining sections of this review. These contributions include quasielastic scattering (dashed), resonance production (dotdashed), and deep inelastic scattering (dotted). Example predictions for each are provided by the NUANCE generator (Casper, 2002).

For comparison, we also include predictions from the NUANCE event generator (Casper, 2002), chosen as a representative of the type of models used in modern neutrino experiments to describe this energy region. The bulk of our discussions center around measurements of -nucleon scattering. Many of these arguments also carry over to scattering, except for one key difference; the energy threshold for the reaction.

Historically, this formalism was used to analyze neutrino QE scattering data on deuterium, subject to minor modifications for nuclear effects. In this way, experiments studying neutrino QE scattering could in principle measure the vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar form factors given that the weak hadronic current contains all three of these components. In practice, the pseudoscalar contribution was typically neglected in the analysis of QE scattering as it enters the cross section multiplied by m 2 =M 2 . Using CVC, the vector form factors could be obtained from electron scattering, thus leaving the neutrino experiments to measure the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon. For the axialvector form factor, it was (and still is) customary to assume a dipole form",

With the vector form factors under control from electron scattering and g A determined with high precision from nuclear beta decay, measurement of the axial-vector form factor (and hence M A ) became the focus of the earliest measurements of neutrino QE scattering. Values of M A ranging from 0.65 to 1.09 GeV were obtained in the period from the late 1960s to early 1990s resulting from fits to both the total rate of observed events and the shape of their measured Q 2 dependence [for a recent review, see Lyubushkin et al. (2009)]. In addition to providing the first measurements of M A and the QE cross section, many of these experiments also performed checks of CVC, fit for the presence of second-class currents, and experimented with different forms for the axialvector form factor. By the end of this period, the neutrino QE cross section could be accurately and consistently described by V-A theory assuming a dipole axial-vector form factor with M A \u00bc 1:026 AE 0:021 GeV (Bernard et al., 2002). These conclusions were largely driven by experimental measurements on deuterium, but less-precise data on other heavier targets also contributed. More recently, some attention has been given to reanalyzing these same data using modern vector form factors as input. The use of updated vector form factors slightly shifts the best-fit axial mass values obtained from these data; however, the conclusion is still that M A $ 1:0 GeV. 9 Modern day neutrino experiments no longer include deuterium but use complex nuclei as their neutrino targets. As a result, nuclear effects become much more important and produce sizable modifications to the QE differential cross section from Eq. (57). With QE events forming the largest contribution to signal samples in many neutrino oscillation experiments, there has been renewed interest in the measurement and modeling of QE scattering on nuclear targets. In such situations, the nucleus is typically described in terms of individual quasifree nucleons that participate in the scattering process (the so-called ''impulse approximation'' approach) (Frullani and Mougey, 1984). Most neutrino experiments use a relativistic Fermi-gas model (Smith and Moniz, 1972) when simulating their QE scattering events, although many other independent particle approaches have been developed in recent years that incorporate more sophisticated treatments. These include spectral function (Nakamura and Seki, 2002;Benhar et al., 2005;Ankowski and Sobczyk, 2006;Benhar and Meloni, 2007;Juszczak, Sobczyk, and Zmuda, 2010), superscaling (Amaro et al., 2005), RPA (Nieves, Amaro, and Valverde, 2004;Nieves, Valverde, and Vicente Vacas, 2006;Sajjad Athar, Chauhan, and Singh, 2010), and plane-wave impulse approximation-based calculations (Butkevich, 2010). In concert, the added nuclear effects from these improved calculations tend to reduce the predicted neutrino QE cross section beyond the Fermi-gas model-based predictions. These reductions are typically on the order of 10%-20% (Alvarez-Ruso, 2010).",

It is currently believed that nuclear effects beyond the impulse approximation approach are responsible for the discrepancies noted in the experimental data. In particular, it is now being recognized that nucleon-nucleon correlations and two-body exchange currents must be included in order to provide a more accurate description of neutrino-nucleus QE scattering. These effects yield significantly enhanced cross sections (larger than the free scattering case) which, in some cases, appear to better match the experimental data (Aguilar-Arevalo et al., 2010a) at low neutrino energies (Amaro et al., 2011b;Barbaro et al., 2011;Bodek and Budd, 2011;Giusti and Meucci, 2011;Martini, Ericson, and Chanfray, 2011;Nieves, Ruiz-Simo, and Vicente-Vacas, 2011;Sobczyk, 2012). They also produce final states that include multiple nucleons, especially when it comes to scattering off of nuclei. The final state need not just include a single nucleon, hence why one needs to be careful in defining a ''quasielastic'' event especially when it comes to scattering off nuclei. In hindsight, the increased neutrino QE cross sections and harder Q 2 distributions (high M A ) observed in much of the experimental data should probably have not come as a surprise. Such effects were also measured in transverse electronnucleus quasielastic scattering many years prior (Carlson, 2002). The possible connection between electron and neutrino QE scattering observations has only been recently appreciated. Today, the role that additional nuclear effects may play in neutrino-nucleus QE scattering remains the subject of much theoretical and experimental scrutiny. Improved theoretical calculations and experimental measurements are already underway. As an example, the first double differential cross section distributions for QE scattering were recently reported by the MiniBooNE experiment (Aguilar-Arevalo et al., 2010a). It is generally recognized that such modelindependent measurements are more useful than comparing M A values. Such differential cross section data are also providing an important new testing ground for improved nuclear model calculations (Amaro et al., 2011a;Giusti and Meucci, 2011;Martini, Ericson, and Chanfray, 2011;Nieves, Simo, and Vacas, 2012;Sobczyk, 2012). Moving forward, additional differential cross section measurements, detailed measurements of nucleon emission, and studies of antineutrino QE scattering are needed before a solid description can be secured.",

Recent results from the NOMAD experiment have expanded the reach out to higher neutrino energies, however, there are currently no existing measurements of the antineutrino QE scattering cross section below 1 GeV. Given that the newly appreciated effects of nucleon-nucleon correlations are expected to be different for neutrinos and antineutrinos, a high priority has been recently given to the study of antineutrino QE scattering at these energies. A precise handle on neutrino and antineutrino QE interaction cross sections will be particularly important in the quest for the detection of CP violation in the leptonic sector going into the future.",

As with QE scattering, a new appreciation for the presence of nuclear effects in such neutral-current interactions has also recently arisen with many new calculations of this cross section on nuclear targets (Amaro et al., 2006;Benhar and Veneziano, 2011;Butkevich and Perevalov, 2011;Meucci, Giusti, and Pacati, 2011). Just as in the charged current case, nuclear corrections can be on the order of 20% or more.",

Such effects are sizable, not well known, and ultimately complicate the description of neutrino interactions. Once created in the initial neutrino interaction, the pion must escape the nucleus before it can be detected. Along its journey, the pion can rescatter, get absorbed, or charge exchange thus altering its identity and kinematics. Improved calculations of such ''final-state interactions'' have been undertaken by a number of groups (Paschos et al., 2007;Antonello et al., 2009;Dytman, 2009;Mosel, 2010a, 2010b). The impact of in-medium effects on the \u00c1 width and the possibility for intranuclear \u00c1 reinteractions (\u00c1N ! NN) also play a role. The combined result are sizable distortions to the interaction cross section and kinematics of final-state hadrons that are produced in a nuclear environment.",

Modern experiments have realized the importance of final-state effects, often directly reporting the distributions of final-state particles they observe. Such ''observable'' cross sections are more useful in that they measure the combined effects of nuclear processes and are much less model dependent. Table XII lists the collection of some of these most recent pion production cross section reportings. Measurements have been produced in the form of both ratios and absolute cross sections, all on carbon-based targets. Similar measurements on additional nuclear targets are clearly needed to help round out our understanding of nuclear effects in pion production interactions.",

            "text": "To date, it has been a challenge to develop a single description that can successfully describe existing coherent pion production measurements across all energies. The most common theoretical approach for describing coherent pion production is typically based on Adler's partially conserved axial current (PCAC) theorem (Adler, 1964) which relates neutrinoinduced coherent pion production to pion-nucleus elastic scattering in the limit Q 2 \u00bc 0. A nuclear form factor is then invoked to extrapolate to nonzero values of Q 2 . Such PCACbased models (Rein and Sehgal, 1983) have existed for many years and have been rather successful in describing coherent pion production at high energy (the prediction shown in Fig. 22 is such a model). With the accumulation of increasingly large amounts of low-energy neutrino data, revised approaches have been applied to describe the reduced level of coherent pion production observed by low-energy experiments. Two such approaches have been developed. The first class of models are again based on PCAC (Rein and Sehgal, 1983;Belkov and Kopeliovich, 1987;Paschos and Kartavtsev, 2003;Kopeliovich, 2005;Paschos et al., 2006;Berger and Sehgal, 2009;Hernandez et al., 2009;Paschos et al., 2009). The other class is microscopic models involving \u00c1 resonance production Kelkar et al. (1997)  Martini, Ericson, and Chanfray (2011). Because this latter class involves \u00c1 formation, their validity is limited to the low-energy region. An excellent review of the current experimental and theoretical situation is available in Alvarez-Ruso (2011a). The study and prediction of coherent pion production is important as it provides another source of potential background for neutrino oscillation experiments.",

Higher energy coherent pion production results have also been recently reported by the MINOS experiment (Cherdack, 2011). of multipion final states depending on the neutrino energy. Figures 23-25 show existing measurements of neutrinoinduced di-pion production cross sections compared to an example prediction including contributions from both resonant and deep inelastic scattering mechanisms. Because of the inherent complexity of reconstructing multiple pions final states, there are not many existing experimental measurements of this process. All of the existing measurements have been performed strictly using deuterium-filled bubble chambers. Improved measurements will be important because they test our understanding of the transition region and will provide a constraint on potential backgrounds for neutrino oscillation experiments operating in higher energy beams.",

            "text": "These reactions typically have small cross sections due in part to the kaon mass and because the kaon channels are not enhanced by any dominant resonance. Measuring neutrinoinduced kaon production is of interest primarily as a source of potential background for proton decay searches. Proton decay modes containing a final-state kaon, p ! K \u00fe \" , have large branching ratios in many supersymmetry grand unified theory models. Because there is a nonzero probability that an atmospheric neutrino interaction can mimic such a proton decay signature, estimating these background rates has become an increasingly important component to such searches. Figure 26 shows the only two experiments which have published cross sections on the dominant associated production channel, n ! \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00c3 0 . Both bubble chamber measurements were performed on a deuterium target and are based on less than 30 events combined. Many other measurements of strange particle production yields have been performed throughout the years, most using bubble chambers (Barish et al., 1974;Deden et al., 1975;Berge et al., 1976Berge et al., , 1978Blietschau et al., 1976;Bell et al., 1978;Hasert et al., 1978;Krenz et al., 1978b;Baker et al., 1981Baker et al., , 1986Bosetti et al., 1982;Brock et al., 1982;Grassler et al., 1982;Son et al., 1983;Aderholz et al., 1992;Willocq et al., 1992;Jones et al., 1993;DeProspo et al., 1994;Agababyan et al., 2006). More recently, NOMAD has reported NC and CC strange particle production yields and multiplicities for a variety of reaction kinematics (Astier et al., 2002;Naumov et al., 2004;Chukanov et al., 2006). As far as theoretical calculations go, predictions for these neutrino-induced kaon production processes have existed for several decades (Albright, 1975;Ezawa et al., 1975;Shrock, 1975;Amer, 1978;Dewan, 1981), although there have been several revised calculations in recent years (Adera et al., 2010;Alam et al., 2010Alam et al., , 2012.",

Improved experimental measurements and theoretical calculations will be especially important for reducing systematics in future precision neutrino oscillation experiments. Luckily, such studies are already underway making use of new intense accelerator-based sources of neutrinos. However, for such updated cross section measurements to be robust, they must be accompanied by an equally precise knowledge of the incoming neutrino flux. Improved hadro-production measurements are key to providing the level of precision necessary. In addition, further scrutiny of nuclear effects in intermediate energy neutrino and antineutrino interactions is absolutely essential. Analysis of data from the MINERA experiment will soon enable the first detailed look at nuclear effects in neutrino interactions. Together, theoretical advances and new data taken on a variety of nuclear targets from the ArgoNeuT, K2K, MicroBooNE, MINERA, MiniBooNE, MINOS, NOMAD, NOvA, and SciBooNE experiments should provide both a necessary and broad foundation going into the future. In order to make progress in our understanding of this energy regime and provide the most clarity, experiments should strive to report what they directly detect in the final state, for example, in the form of model-independent differential cross sections.",
