The search is based on 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, including at least one b-tagged jet and a large-radius jet identified as originating from the hadronic decay of a high-momentum W boson. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed in the reconstructed T mass distribution. The observed 95% confidence level lower limit on the T mass are 1350 GeV assuming 100% branching ratio to W b. In the SU(2) singlet scenario, the lower mass limit is 1170 GeV. This search is also sensitive to a heavy vector-like B quark decaying to W t and other final states. The results are thus reinterpreted to provide a 95% confidence level lower limit on the B quark mass at 1250 GeV assuming 100% branching ratio to W t; in the SU(2) singlet scenario, the limit is 1080 GeV. Mass limits on both T and B production are also set as a function of the decay branching ratios. The 100% branching ratio limits are found to be applicable to heavy vector-like Y and X production that decay to W b and W t, respectively.",

However, the underlying nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unknown. Naturalness arguments [3] require that quadratic divergences arising from radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass are cancelled by a new mechanism to avoid fine-tuning. This paper presents a search for pair production of vector-like quarks (VLQs) decaying into third-generation quarks using the pp collision data collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.",

            "text": "Several new mechanisms have been proposed in theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In supersymmetry, the cancellation comes from assigning superpartners to the Standard Model (SM) bosons and fermions. Alternatively, Little Higgs [4,5] and Composite Higgs [6,7] models introduce a spontaneously broken global symmetry, with the Higgs boson emerging as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson [8]. These latter models predict the existence of VLQs, defined as colour-triplet spin-1/2 fermions whose left-and right-handed chiral components have the same transformation properties under the weak-isospin SU (2) gauge group [9,10]. Depending on the model, vector-like quarks are produced in SU (2) singlets, doublets or triplets of flavours T , B, X or Y , in which the first two have the same charge as the SM top and b quarks while the vector-like Y and X quarks have charge 1 \u22124/3 and 5/3. In addition, in these models, VLQs are expected to couple preferentially to third-generation quarks [9,11] and can have flavour-changing neutral-current decays in addition to the charged-current decays characteristic of chiral quarks. As a result, an up-type T quark can decay not only to a W boson and a b quark, but also to a Z or Higgs boson and a top quark (T \u2192 W b, Zt, and Ht). Similarly, a down-type B quark can decay to a Z or Higgs boson and a b quark, in addition to decaying to a W boson and a top quark (B \u2192 W t, Zb, and Hb). Instead, due to their charge, vector-like Y quarks decay exclusively to W b while vector-like X quarks decay exclusively to W t. To be consistent with the results from precision electroweak measurements a small mass-splitting between VLQs belonging to the same SU(2) multiplet is required, but no requirement is placed on which member of the doublet is heavier [12]. Cascade decays such as T \u2192 W B \u2192 W W t are thus assumed to be kinematically forbidden. Decays of VLQs into final states with first and second generation quarks, although not favoured, are not excluded [13,14].",

The samples were generated for an SU(2) singlet T VLQ, but with equal branching ratios of the T quark to each final state. To check the dependence of the results on the weak-isospin of the VLQ, one sample was also generated using the SU(2) doublet model including only the T contributions. The signal samples are normalised to pair-production cross-sections computed using Top++ v2.0 [28], including next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections and soft-gluon resummation to NNLL accuracy [29][30][31][32][33][34], and using the MSTW 2008 NNLO PDF set.

The nominal tt MC sample was generated with Powheg-Box v2 interfaced with Pythia 6.428 [39,40] for the parton shower and hadronisation, using the Perugia2012 tune [41] and the CT10 PDF set, and setting the h damp parameter to the mass of the top quark.

Further, samples with Powheg-Box v2 interfaced with Pythia 6.428 were generated varying the factorisation and normalisation scales by 2 and 0.5, as well as the next-to-leading-order (NLO) radiation factor, h damp , between m top and twice m top .

The jet energy and pseudorapidity are further calibrated to account for residual detector effects using energy and pseudorapidity dependent calibration factors derived from simulation. The k t -based trimming algorithm reclusters the jet constituents into subjets with a finer-grained resolution (the R-parameter for subjets is set to R sub = 0.2). Subjets that contribute less than 5% to the p T of the large-R jets are discarded. The properties (e.g. transverse momentum and invariant mass) of the jet are recalculated using only the constituents of the remaining subjets. Trimmed large-R jets are only considered if they have p T > 200 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. To identify large-R jets that are likely to have originated from the hadronic decay of W bosons (W had ) and not from the hadronic decay of top quarks or multi-jet background, jet substructure information is exploited using the ratio of the energy correlation functions D \u03b2=1 2 [60,61] and jet mass [58]. Selected large-R jets must pass both the substructure and mass requirements of the 50%efficient W -tagging working point [18].

The compatibility of the data with the background-only hypothesis is estimated by integrating the distribution of the test statistic, approximated using the asymptotic formulae [75], above the observed value of q 0 . This value is computed for each signal scenario considered, defined by the assumed mass of the heavy quark and the three decay branching ratios. The lowest p-value is found to be \u223c50%, for a T mass of 700 GeV. Thus no significant excess above the background expectation is found.

Nonetheless, the sensitivity to BB production is expected to be weaker, as the reconstructed T mass distribution is used as the final discriminant. Without any modifications to the analysis to specifically target BB production, observed (expected) lower limits at 95% CL are set at 1250 (1150) GeV when assuming B(B \u2192 W t) = 1 and at 1080 (980) GeV for the SU(2) singlet B scenario.
