In the analysis, the QED background yield under the \u03c8(3686) peak is evaluated by analyzing the two sets of off-resonance data taken close in time with the peak samples, i.e. center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 3.65 GeV collected in 2009 and four energy points ranging from 3.542 to 3.600 GeV collected in 2012 for a \u03c4 -mass scan. The strategy for the background estimation was successfully used in our previous measurement of the number of \u03c8(3686) events collected in 2009 [2].",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight (TOF) system, and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoid magnet with a field strength of 1.0 T (0.9 T in 2012). The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with resistive plate counter modules interleaved with steel as a muon identifier. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% over the 4\u03c0 stereo angle. The chargedparticle momentum resolution at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the photon energy resolution at 1 GeV is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (end-caps) of the EMC. More details about the apparatus can be found in Ref. [3]. The MDC encountered the Malter effect [4] due to cathode aging during \u03c8(3686) data taking in 2012. This effect was suppressed by mixing about 0.2% water vapor into the MDC operating gas [5] and can be well modeled by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The other sub-detectors worked well during 2009 and 2012.",

Figures 1 and 2 show the scatter plots of the momentum of the first charged track versus that of the second charged track, and the distribution of the opening angle between the two charged tracks for the type-II candidates from simulated Bhabha (top) and inclusive \u03c8(3686) (bottom) MC events, respectively. Further, an energy fraction requirement E visible /E cm >0.4 is applied to suppress the low energy background (LEB), comprised mostly of e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 +X and double ISR events (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03b3 ISR X). Here, E visible is the visible energy which is defined as the total energy of all charged tracks (calculated with the track momentum assuming the tracks to be pions) and neutral showers, and E cm is the center-of-mass energy. Figure 3 (top) shows the E visible /E cm distributions of the type-II events for the \u03c8(3686) data and inclusive MC sample. The visible excess in data at low energy is from the LEB events. Unless noted, in all plots, the points with error bars are the \u03c8(3686) data collected in 2012, and the histogram is the corresponding MC simulation.  For type-I events, at least two photons are required in an event. Compared to those events with high charged track multiplicity, the type-I sample has more background according to the vertex distribution of the charged tracks. Thus, a neutral hadron \u03c0 0 candidate is required to suppress the background events [10], where the \u03c0 0 candidate is reconstructed by any \u03b3\u03b3 combination. In an event, only the \u03c0 0 candidate with a mass closest to \u03c0 0 nominal value and satisfying |M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212M \u03c0 0 | < 0.015 MeV/c 2 is kept for further analysis. Figure 4 shows the M \u03b3\u03b3 distribution of selected \u03c0 0 candidates for type-I events. With the above selection criteria, the corresponding E visible /E cm distributions of the candidate events for the \u03c8(3686) data and inclusive MC sample are shown in Fig. 3 (bottom). An additional requirement E visible /E cm > 0.4 is used to suppress the LEB events.",

Alternatively, as mentioned in Section 1, the off-resonance data samples can be used to estimate the continuum QED background yield. We apply the same approach to determine the yields of collision events and their uncertainties for the off-resonance data samples, which are dominated from the continuum QED processes. With the above method, the effect of QED background is independent of the MC simulation and the corresponding systematic bias is expected to be small. For the \u03c8(3686) and off-resonance data samples, the backgrounds from the radiative return to the J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 decay due to the extended tail are very similar due to the small difference in the center-of-mass energies. The total cross sections for these two processes are estimated to be 1.11 nb and 1.03 nb at the \u03c8(3686) peak and the off-resonance energy point, respectively [12]. Detailed MC studies show that the efficiencies for the continuum processes are equal at these two energy points. Therefore, the off-resonance data can be employed to subtract both the continuum QED and J/\u03c8 decay backgrounds using a scaling factor, f, determined from the integrated luminosity multiplied by a factor of 1 s to account for the energy dependence of the cross section,",

For the \u03c4 -scan data, the average energy is determined to be \u221a s =3.572 GeV. The scaling factors f are determined to be 3.61 and 20.56 for the 2009 and 2012 data samples, respectively. The integrated luminosities of the data samples taken at different energy points are determined from e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 events using the following selection criteria. Each event is required to have no good charged tracks and at least two showers. The energies for the two most energetic showers must be higher than 1.6 GeV, and the cosine of the polar angle of each electromagnetic shower must be within the region |cos\u03b8| < 0.8. The two most energetic showers in the \u03c8(3686) rest frame must be back to back with azimuthal angles  [13], respectively. Here, the errors are statistical only. The systematic uncertainties related to the luminosity almost cancel in calculating the scaling factor due to the small difference between the energy points. In order to show that the shape of the LEB events in off-resonance data is consistent with that in the \u03c8(3686) sample, and, therefore, scaled off-resonance data can be used to remove LEB background in the \u03c8(3686) sample, we select an LEB sample by requiring E visible /E cm <0.35, where few QED events are expected. Figure 6 (top and bottom) shows the comparisons of the E visible /E cm distributions for the type-I (top) and type-II (bottom) LEB events between the \u03c8(3686) and the scaled off-resonance data samples taken in 2012. The ratios of the number of events between the \u03c8(3686) peak and the off-resonance energy are 22.78 and 22.57 for the type I and type II events, respectively. Compared with the scaling factor obtained from the integrated luminosity normalization in Eq. 3, a difference of 10% is found for the type-I and type-II events. Similar differences are found for the 2009 data sample [2]. Since the fraction of LEB events in the selected sample is very small, the effect of this difference for the background estimation is negligible.",

            "text": "A detailed topological analysis is performed for the events with N good =0 in the inclusive MC sample. Most of these events come from the well-known decay channels, such as \u03c8(3686) \u2192 X + J/\u03c8 (where X denotes \u03b7,\u03c0 0 ,\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ,\u03b3\u03b3 etc.) and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The fraction of these N good = 0 events in the inclusive MC sample is \u223c2.0%, of which the pure neutral channels contribute about 1.0%. As shown in Fig. 7, the MC simulation models data well. Therefore, we investigate the pure neutral hadronic events, which are selected according to the following scheme. With the same charged track and shower selection criteria as above, we require N good = 0 and N \u03b3 > 3. The latter requirement is used to suppress e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 and beam-associated background events. The same selection criteria are imposed on the off-resonance data and inclusive MC events. Figure 9 shows the distributions of the total energies in the EMC, E EMC , for the different data sets and inclusive MC sample. The peaking events around the center-of-mass energy are taken as the pure neutral hadronic candidates. As shown in Fig. 9, the number of signal events is determined by a fit of the E EMC distribution. In this fit, the signal is described by a Crystal Ball function, the QED background in \u03c8(3686) data is described by the shape of off-resonance data (off-resonance data at \u221a s = 3.65 GeV or \u03c4 -scan data) after scaling for luminosity, and the other backgrounds are described by a polynomial function. For the 2012 data, the difference in the number of pure neutral hadronic events between the data and the inclusive MC simulation sample is 11% if the \u03c4 -scan data sample is taken as the off-resonance data to estimate the background function, as shown in Fig. 9 (top). However, this difference changes to 18% if we use the off-resonance data at \u221a s=3.65GeV for the background function, as shown in Fig. 9 (middle). The larger difference is used to estimate the uncertainty conservatively. Since the fraction  of the pure neutral hadronic events is about 1.0% of the total selected candidates, the uncertainty due to the missing N good =0 events should be less than 18%\u00d71%= 0.18% for the 2012 data. The same method is applied to the 2009 data samples, and the uncertainty is 0.25%, which is somewhat larger than the previous analysis [2].",
