The measurement is based on 36 pb \u00c01 of data recorded at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC. The left-handed, right-handed, and longitudinal polarization fractions (f L , f R , and f 0 , respectively) of W bosons with transverse momenta larger than 50 GeV are determined by using decays to both electrons and muons. The muon final state yields the most precise measurement: \u00f0f L \u00c0 f R \u00de \u00c0 \u00bc 0:240 AE 0:036\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:031\u00f0syst\u00de and f \u00c0 0 \u00bc 0:183 AE 0:087\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:123\u00f0syst\u00de for negatively charged W bosons and \u00f0f L \u00c0 f R \u00de \u00fe \u00bc 0:310 AE 0:036\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:017\u00f0syst\u00de and f \u00fe 0 \u00bc 0:171 AE 0:085\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:099\u00f0syst\u00de for positively charged W bosons.

            "text": "The measurement of the kinematic properties of W bosons produced at hadron colliders provides a stringent test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations as well as being an important prerequisite to searches for physics beyond the standard model. The pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offer both a new environment and a higher energy to study W bosons with large transverse momenta recoiling against several energetic jets. The sizable production cross section results in significant samples of W bosons, while the nature of the initial state leads to an enhancement of the quark-gluon contribution to W \u00fe jet production when compared to the Tevatron p \" p collider, where quark-gluon and antiquarkgluon processes contribute equally. This dominance of quark-gluon initial states, along with the V-A nature of the coupling of the W boson to fermions, implies that at the LHC W bosons with high transverse momenta are expected to exhibit a sizable left-handed polarization [1,2]. A significant asymmetry in the transverse momentum spectra of the neutrino and charged lepton from subsequent leptonic W decays is therefore expected. This Letter reports the first measurement of the polarization of W bosons with large transverse momenta ( > 50 GeV) at the LHC, using a data sample of pp collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 AE 1:4 pb \u00c01 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, recorded with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector.",

This can be quantified via a measurement of the A 4 parameter. However, the inability to determine the momentum of the neutrino along the beam axis introduces a twofold ambiguity in the determination of the momentum of the W boson. Therefore, it is not possible to precisely determine the W boson rest frame required to extract the W decay angles. To overcome this, a variable which exhibits a strong correlation with cos \u00c3 is introduced. The lepton projection variable L P is defined as the projection of the scaled transverse momentum of the charged lepton,p T \u00f0'\u00de=jp T \u00f0W\u00dej, onto the normalized transverse momentum of the parent W boson,p T \u00f0W\u00de=jp T \u00f0W\u00dej:",

A crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass or scintillator hadron calorimeter surround the tracking volume and cover the region jj < 3. The steel return yoke outside the solenoid is in turn instrumented with gas detectors, which are used to identify muons.

The most significant sources, which are listed in supplemental Table II  [14], stem from the energy scale and resolution [15] uncertainties of the jets recoiling against the W boson, which enter in the measurement of its transverse momentum. These uncertainties are fully correlated between the electron and muon channels. The recoil energy scale is varied by its measured uncertainty [16], and the effect is propagated through the analysis, resulting in modified L P distributions. The measurement is repeated, and the full difference from the nominal value is quoted as the systematic uncertainty from this source. The effect is smaller for values of L P close to 1, corresponding to low values of~E T , and hence the uncertainty is smaller for W \u00c0 relative to W \u00fe . The same procedure is followed for the recoil resolution, electron energy, and muon momentum scale. Decays of Z bosons to electrons are used to derive corrections, in bins of the electron pseudorapidity, which calibrate the electron energy scale. An uncertainty of AE50% on these corrections is assumed, in order to cover the full range of variations. Decays of Z bosons to muons are used to constrain the muon momentum scale, and an uncertainty of 1% at 100 GeV is found. The fit range of the lepton projection variable is restricted to 0:0 < L P < 1:3, as a result of the minimization of the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurement, independently for both the electron and muon channels.",

The lepton projection variable also depends weakly on the values of the polarization parameters A 1 , A 2 , and A 3 , which are not measured. In order to evaluate the magnitude of the effect, these coefficients are varied by AE10% with respect to recent standard model calculations at leading-order QCD [2]. These variations produce a negligible change in the W boson polarization measurement. A similar result is obtained for the shape of the L P distributions by varying the parton distribution functions using the CTEQ6.6 PDF error set.",

By using a sample of collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u00c01 , the measurement is performed for both charges of the W boson, in the electron and muon final states. The results from both of these channels are consistent, as are the combined fit results. The muon fit result yields the most precise measurement: \u00f0f L \u00c0f R \u00de \u00c0 \u00bc 0:240AE0:036\u00f0stat\u00deAE 0:031\u00f0syst\u00de and f \u00c0 0 \u00bc 0:183 AE 0:087\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:123\u00f0syst\u00de for negatively charged W bosons and \u00f0f L \u00c0 f R \u00de \u00fe \u00bc 0:310 AE 0:036\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:017\u00f0syst\u00de and f \u00fe 0 \u00bc 0:171 AE 0:085\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:099\u00f0syst\u00de for positively charged W bosons. This measurement establishes a difference between the left-handed and right-handed polarization parameters with a significance of 7.8 standard deviations for W \u00fe bosons and 5.1 standard deviations for W \u00c0 bosons. This is the first observation that high-p T bosons produced in pp collisions are predominantly left-handed, as expected in the standard model.",
