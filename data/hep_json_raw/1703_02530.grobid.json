            "text": "A measurement of the top quark mass is reported in events containing a single top quark produced via the electroweak t channel. The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . Top quark candidates are reconstructed from their decay to a W boson and a b quark, with the W boson decaying leptonically to a muon and a neutrino. The final state signature and kinematic properties of single top quark events in the t channel are used to enhance the purity of the sample, suppressing the contribution from top quark pair production. A fit to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quark candidates yields a value of the top quark mass of 172.95 \u00b1 0.77 (stat) +0.97   \u22120.93 (syst) GeV. This result is in agreement with the current world average, and represents the first measurement of the top quark mass in event topologies not dominated by top quark pair production, therefore contributing to future averages with partially uncorrelated systematic uncertainties and a largely uncorrelated statistical uncertainty.",

A combination of measurements from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron and ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC yields a value of 173.34 \u00b1 0.27 (stat) \u00b1 0.71 (syst) GeV for the top quark mass m t [1]. Measuring m t in single top quark production enriches the range of available measurements, exploiting a sample which is almost statistically independent from those used by previous ones, and with systematic uncertainties partially uncorrelated from those considered in tt production. Because of the different production mechanism, the mass extraction is affected differently by the modelling of both perturbative effects, such as initiale-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch and final-state radiation, and nonperturbative effects, such as colour reconnection, in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Some discussion on these topics, though mainly restricted to the case of pair production, can be found in Refs. [2,3]. In perspective, the lower level of gluon radiation and final state combinatorial arrangements with respect to tt production will make this channel a good candidate for precision measurements of m t when larger samples of events are available.",

Single top quark s-channel and tW associated production are considered as backgrounds for this measurement and simulated with the same generator. Top quark pair production, single vector boson production associated with jets (referred to as W/Z+jets in the following), and double vector boson (diboson) production are amongst the background processes taken into consideration and have been simulated with the MadGraph generator, version 5.148 [23], interfaced with pythia for parton showering. The pythia generator is used to simulate QCD multijet event samples enriched with isolated muons. The value of the top quark mass used in all simulated samples is 172.5 GeV. All samples are generated using the CTEQ6.6M [24] PDF set and use the Z2* underlying event tune [25]. The factorisation and renormalisation scales are both set to m t for the single top quark samples, while a dynamic scale is used for the other samples, defined as the sum in quadrature of the transverse momentum ( p T ) and the mass of the particles produced in the central process. The passage of particles through the detector is simulated using the Geant4 toolkit [26]. The simulation includes addi-tional overlapping pp collisions (pileup) with a multiplicity that is tuned to match the one observed in data.",

The '2J0T' sample is mostly populated by such events and contains a large number of events, making it in principle a suitable control region to study the expected contribution of W+jets events to the background in the signal region. However, the simulation shows that the reconstructed invariant mass distribution for W+jets events in the '2J0T' sample differs from that of the '2J1T' sample. Thus, simulation has been used for the characterisation of the W+jets component, as well as for all other nontop-quark background contributions. The shape of the invariant mass distribution for the sum of all non-top-quark background sources is well reproduced by a Novosibirsk function [37], with parameters \u03bc and \u03c3 representing the Gaussian core, and \u03c4 describing the skewness of the distribution. The option to use the full simulated sample before the final selection, as is done for events containing top quarks, has not been chosen, as the parameters of the fitted function vary significantly with the requirement on |\u03b7 j |, as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the sample obtained after applying the final selection is used to determine the shape parameters in the final fit.",

The JES uncertainties are p T -and \u03b7-dependent, and are taken into account by scaling the energies of all jets up and down according to their individual uncertainties, as determined in dedicated studies [31]. The scaling is then propagated to the calculation of p miss T , and all other quantities dependent on the jet energies. The mass fit is repeated on the 'scaled' simulated sample and the shift with respect to the nominal fit is taken as a measure of the uncertainty. The uncertainties in the JES are subdivided into independent sources and grouped into different categories following the prescription defined in Ref. [39], aimed at simplifying the combination of measurements reported by the different LHC experiments. A total of five categories are identified referring to the effect of uncertainties related to the absolute scale determination using Drell-Yan events (\"in-situ correlation group\"), relative (\u03b7-dependent) calibration, and high-and lowp T extrapolation (\"inter-calibration group\"), flavour-specific corrections (\"flavour-correlation group\"), pileup corrections using an offset dependence on the jet p T (\"pileup p T uncertainty\"), and remaining sources, uncorrelated between ATLAS and CMS (\"uncorrelated group\"). b quark hadronisation model: This is the term that accounts for the flavour-dependent uncertainties arising from the simulation of the parton fragmentation. The total uncertainty can be decomposed into two separate contributions: the b quark fragmentation uncertainty and the uncertainty from b hadron decays. The b quark fragmentation uncertainty has been derived in the same way as in the top quark mass measurement using semileptonic tt events [38]. The Bowler-Lund fragmentation function for b hadrons is retuned to agree with the x B data measured by the ALEPH [40] and DEL-PHI [41] Collaborations, where x B represents the fraction of the b quark energy retained by a b hadron. A weight is attributed to each event, according to the x B value, and the difference with respect to the nominal setup is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty from the semileptonic branching ratio of b hadrons is taken from Ref. [38], in which the branching fractions were varied by \u22120.45 and +0.77% to give the possible range of values and the associated uncertainty. Jet energy resolution (JER): After correcting for the mismatch between the data and simulation for the energy resolution, the uncertainty is determined by varying the corrected JER within its \u03b7-dependent \u00b11 standard deviation uncertainties. These changes are then propagated to the calculation of p miss T . Muon momentum scale: This contribution is determined by varying the reconstructed muon momenta by their uncertainties. These are determined as a function of the muon \u03b7 and p T with a \"tag-and-probe\" method based on Drell-Yan data, as described in Ref. [42]. Unclustered missing transverse momentum: The uncertainty arising from the component of the missing transverse momentum that is not due to particles reconstructed as leptons and photons or clustered in jets (\"unclustered p miss T \") is determined by varying it by \u00b110%.",

            "text": "The top quark mass is measured in a sample enriched in events with a single top quark for the first time. Top quarks are reconstructed from decays to a W boson and a b quark, with the W boson decaying to a muon and a neutrino. In the final sample, events with a top quark from single production in the t-channel account for 73% of the total number of events with a top quark. The measurement is obtained from a fit to the distribution of the reconstructed mass of top quark candidates, where the t-channel single top quark component is modelled separately from the contribution of other top quark production channels. The measured value is m t = 172.95 \u00b1 0.77 (stat) +0.97 \u22120.93 (syst) GeV. This is in agreement with the current combination of Tevatron and LHC results, 173.34\u00b10.27 (stat)\u00b10.71 (syst) GeV, which is based on measurements using tt events. Because many of the systematic uncertainties affecting the measurement of m t using single top quark t-channel events are totally or partially uncorrelated with the measurements using tt events, and in addition the data sample analysed is largely statistically independent of the samples previously used, the result presented in this paper will be useful in the determination of world averages of the top quark mass. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
