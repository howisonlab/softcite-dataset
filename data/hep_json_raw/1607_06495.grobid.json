The crosssection is measured for leptons with pseudorapidities in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5, transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV and dilepton invariant mass in the range 60 < m( ) < 120 GeV. The integrated cross-section from averaging the two final states is \u03c3 Z = 194.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 7.6 pb, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is due to systematic effects, and the third is due to the luminosity determination. In addition, differential cross-sections are measured as functions of the Z boson rapidity, transverse momentum and the angular variable \u03c6 * \u03b7 .",

The analysis uses a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 294\u00b111 pb \u22121 and considers events where the boson decays either to a dimuon or a dielectron final state. The two final states offer statistically independent samples with largely independent systematic uncertainties. The analysis is performed using similar methods to previous LHCb measurements of electroweak boson production at lower pp collision energies [1][2][3][4][5]. The LHCb detector measures particle production in the forward region; the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported similar measurements at \u221a s = 13 TeV [6, 7] in a different kinematic region.",

            "text": "Measurements of electroweak gauge boson production are benchmark tests of Standard Model processes at hadron colliders, and are of interest for constraining the parton distribution functions (PDFs) that describe the structure of the proton. Because of the longitudinal boost required for a Z boson to be produced in the forward region, LHCb results are particularly sensitive to effects at low and high values of Bjorken-x [8], and have been used to constrain global PDF fits [9][10][11]. The \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collisions allow LHCb to access lower values of x than previous measurements at 7 and 8 TeV. In addition, the boson transverse momentum (p T ) and \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions can be used to test Monte Carlo modelling of additional higher-order radiation that arises from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The \u03c6 * \u03b7 variable [12] is defined as \u03c6 * \u03b7 \u2261 tan(\u03c6 acop /2)/ cosh(\u2206\u03b7/2), where the acoplanarity angle \u03c6 acop \u2261 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 depends on the difference in azimuthal angle of the two leptons, \u2206\u03c6, and \u2206\u03b7 is the difference in pseudorapidity of the two leptons. This variable probes similar physics to that probed by the boson transverse momentum, but with better experimental resolution.",

The calorimeters at LHCb are optimised for the study of low E T physics, and individual cells saturate for transverse energies greater than approximately 10 GeV. Electron reconstruction at LHCb therefore relies on accurate tracking measurements to determine the electron momentum. However, bremsstrahlung photons are often emitted as an electron traverses the LHCb detector, so the measured momentum does not directly correspond to the momentum of the electron produced in the proton-proton collision. These photons are often collinear with the electron and are detected in the same saturated calorimeter cell so that recovery of this emitted photon energy is incomplete. Consequently LHCb accurately determines the direction of electrons, but tends to underestimate their energy by a variable amount, typically around 25%. Despite these challenges, the excellent angular resolution of electrons provided by the LHCb detector means that measurements using the dielectron final state can be used to complement analyses of angular variables such as rapidity and \u03c6 * \u03b7 in the dimuon final state [2, 4]. Simulated pp collisions for the study of reconstruction effects are generated using Pythia 8 [16,17] with a specific LHCb configuration [18]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [19], in which final-state radiation is modelled using Photos [20]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [21,22] as described in ref. [23].",

The results are also compared to predictions using the Monash 2013 tune of Pythia 8 [16,17,26] and an updated version of the LHCb-specific Pythia 8 tune [18].

Similar techniques to those used in previous analyses are applied to quantify the contribution of each source [3, 5]. The contribution where at least one muon is produced by the decay of heavy flavour particles is studied by selecting sub-samples where this contribution is enhanced, either by requiring that the muons are not spatially isolated from other activity in the event, or by requiring that the muons are not consistent with a common production point. Studies on these two sub-samples are consistent, and the background contribution is estimated to be 180 \u00b1 50 events. The contribution from misidentified hadrons is evaluated from the probability with which hadrons are incorrectly identified as muons, and is determined to be 100 \u00b1 13 events. Following refs. [1, 3, 5], this evaluation is made with randomly triggered data. An alternative estimate of the contribution from these sources is found by selecting events where both muons have the same charge, but pass all other selection criteria. The assumption that the charges of the selected muons are uncorrelated for these sources is validated by confirming that the same-sign event yield is compatible with the opposite-sign event yield in background-enriched regions. The overall number of same-sign events is 198, with the numbers of \u00b5 + \u00b5 + and \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 candidates statistically compatible with each other.

A loose requirement is made on the dielectron invariant mass, m(ee) > 40 GeV, since many events where the dielectron system is produced with an invariant mass above 60 GeV may be reconstructed at lower mass due to bremsstrahlung. Effects arising from the difference between the fiducial acceptance and the selection requirements will be discussed in section 4.4.

A sample of same-sign e \u00b1 e \u00b1 combinations, otherwise subject to the same selection criteria as the standard dataset, is used to provide a data-based estimate of the largest backgrounds. Hadrons that shower early in the ECAL and fake the signature of an electron are expected to be the dominant background, and should contribute roughly equally to same-sign and opposite-sign pairs. The contribution from heavy-flavour decays is also expected to contribute approximately equally to same-sign and opposite-sign datasets, and is much smaller than the background due to misidentified hadrons. Overall, 1 255 candidate same-sign events are selected, with no significant difference observed between the e + e + and e \u2212 e \u2212 datasets. In order to ascertain the reliability of this procedure, a hadron-enriched sample is selected by requiring that one of the electron candidates is associated with a significant energy deposit in the HCAL, suggesting that it is likely to be a misidentified hadron. The numbers of same-sign and opposite-sign pairs satisfying these requirements are found to agree within 6.2%. Consequently a 6.2% uncertainty is assigned to the estimated yield of background events, which corresponds to a 0.5% uncertainty on the signal yield. In addition, simulated background datasets of Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decays, tt events and WW events are generated [16,17] and studied similarly to the dimuon final state.

The use of different techniques to determine efficiencies to those applied in the muon channel provides uncorrelated systematic uncertainties between the two measurements. The efficiency for electrons is factorised into similar components to those applied in the dimuon analysis, though one extra effect is considered. The GEC efficiency determines the probability that the dielectron candidates pass the GEC present in the hardware trigger. There is no such requirement in the dimuon trigger. The GEC efficiency for dielectron data is determined from the dimuon data, correcting for small differences in the detector response to muons and electrons. The average GEC efficiency is 79% and exhibits a weak dependence on rapidity and \u03c6 * \u03b7 . The trigger efficiency is determined directly from data using a tag-and-probe method, and is typically 93%. The efficiency with which both electrons are identified by the calorimetry is typically 78% and is determined from simulation that has been calibrated with data. This efficiency exhibits a significant dependence on the boson rapidity, since the LHCb calorimeter acceptance only extends as far as \u03b7 \u2248 4.25. The track reconstruction and kinematic efficiency describes the efficiency with which electrons that are in the fiducial region are reconstructed with p T > 20 GeV. It corrects both for failure to reconstruct a track and for incomplete bremsstrahlung recovery incorrectly reconstructing electrons with p T below the 20 GeV threshold. This is also determined from simulation calibrated to data, and is on average 48%.",

The contributions from different sources are combined in quadrature. The uncertainties on the fiducial cross-section measurement are summarised in table 1. For both muons and electrons, the statistical precisions of the efficiencies are assigned as systematic uncertainties. For muons, the accuracy of the tag-and-probe methods used to determine efficiencies is tested in simulation, and efficiencies calculated using the tagand-probe method are generally found to match simulated efficiencies at the per-mille level, with the largest difference arising from the determination of the track reconstruction efficiency. An uncertainty of 1% is assigned to this efficiency for each muon. The method of treating each muon independently and applying the efficiencies as a function of the muon pseudorapidity is also studied in simulation, and is found to be accurate to better than 0.6%. This is also assigned as a systematic uncertainty. For electrons, the accuracy of the method used to determine the trigger efficiency is studied by applying it to the simulated dataset and comparing the resulting efficiencies to those directly determined in the same dataset: no bias is observed, and no additional uncertainty is assigned. For the electron track reconstruction efficiency the relative performance in data and simulation is studied using a tag-and-probe method and an uncertainty of 1.6% is assigned. The uncertainty associated with potential mismodelling of the electron identification efficiency is determined by comparing between data and simulation the distributions of calorimeter energy deposits used to identify electrons. The impact of any mismodelling is propagated through the measurement, and an uncertainty of 1.3% is assigned. Apart from the uncertainties arising from the statistical precision of the efficiency evaluation, these uncertainties are treated as fully correlated between bins.
