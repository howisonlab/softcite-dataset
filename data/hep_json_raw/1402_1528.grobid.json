As an intermediate step of the present investigation the mass of the KS meson has been measured to be M (KS) = 497.607 \u00b1 0.007 \u00b1 0.015 MeV. Both M (D 0 ) and M (KS) are the most precise single measurements of the masses of these mesons.",

            "text": "The D 0 meson, the ground state of the charm meson family, and the K S meson, the ground store of the strange meson family, occupy an important place in hadron spectroscopy, and precision determination of their masses is of particular importance. Not only do the masses of K S and D 0 mesons provide precision calibration standards for masses and mass differences below 2.5 GeV as M (J/\u03c8) and M (\u03c8(2S)) do in the 3-4 GeV mass region [1,2], but precision determination of M (D 0 ) is of crucial importance in time-dependent analyses of D 0 -D 0 mixing and CP violation [3][4][5]. Recently, many observations of mesons that do not conveniently fit in the conventional |qq > meson families have been reported, and several of these are conjectured to be weakly bound hadronic molecules of D and D S mesons [6]. The most famous of these 'exotics' is the X(3872) meson which can be modeled as aD 0 D * 0 molecule. The small binding energy of X(3872) requires a precision determination of the masses of D 0 and D * 0 mesons [7,8]. In this paper we present results for the highest precision measurement of M (D 0 ). As an intermediate step in our analysis, we have also made a precision measurement of M (K S ).",

The pions in this decay have momenta up to \u223c400 MeV, and the calibration obtained for them can be reliably used in the study of D 0 \u2192 K3\u03c0 decays which contain charged pions and kaons in a similar range of momenta. By analyzing our data for the exclusive reaction, \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, with M (J/\u03c8) fixed at the precision value, M (J/\u03c8) KEDR =3096.917 MeV we determine the new value of the solenoid B-field correction factor, B COR (new), which corrects the pion momenta such the mass of \u03c8(2S) we measure, M (\u03c8(2S)) PRESENT equals the precision value M (\u03c8(2S)) KEDR = 3686.114 MeV. It is found that the CLEO-c default value B COR (default) has to be increased by 0.0289%, or 2.89\u00d710 \u22124 , so that B COR (new)=0.995488. The \u03c8(2S) mass spectrum obtained with this corrected B-field is shown in in the same manner.",

We analyze the inclusive reaction \u03c8(2S) \u2192 K S + X to determine M (K S ). We use the precision calibration of the B-field as determined in the first step for this purpose. The pions in \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 calibration have momenta up to 400 MeV. For determining M (K S ) we only use K S with momenta p(K S ) < 400 MeV for which 95% of pions from K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay have momenta <360 MeV. Fig. 2 shows that for K S of momenta <400 MeV, the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 from \u03c8(2S) decay and from K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay have nearly identical pion momentum distributions and angular distributions of the pions with respect to beam. Fig. 3 shows the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution corresponding to B COR (new)=0.995488 for events from the decay K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The distribution is fitted as described before, with the fraction of the simple Gaussian and bifurcated Gaussian being 52% and 48%, respectively.  Although we have used M (\u03c8(2S)) based energy calibration obtained for pions with p(\u03c0) < 400 MeV to determine M (K S ) for K S decays with p(K S ) < 400 MeV, we find that the calibration is good for higher momenta. For example, we find that if decays with p(K S ) up to 650 MeV are included, M (K S ) varies by less than 1\u03c3, or < 10 keV.",

Before analyzing the D 0 \u2192 K3\u03c0 decays, it is necessary to determine the appropriate B COR values for the D 0 subruns.
