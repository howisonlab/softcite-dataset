It is demonstrated how modes of this sort can be cleanly included in measurements of the unitarity triangle angle \u03b3 using B \u2213 \u2192 D K \u2213 decays. The high CP-even content of D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , in particular, makes this a promising mode for improving the precision on \u03b3 .",

This information can be obtained from studies of quantum-correlated DD mesons pro-decays. The channel D \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 is a similar, but less abundant, self-conjugate mode that has also attracted interest [20,21]. This Letter presents the first analysis of these decays using quantumcorrelated DD decays, and measurements of their CP content, making use of the CLEO-c \u03c8(3770) data set. These measurements allow the inclusive decays to be included in future B \u2213 \u2192 D K \u2213 analyses in a straightforward and model-independent manner, thus allowing for an improved determination of the angle \u03b3 . Throughout the effects of CP violation in charm mesons are neglected, which is a good assumption given theoretical expectations and current experimental limits [6,22].",

In addition, to suppress background from D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 in the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 selection, requirements are placed on the vertex of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair to be consistent with originating from the e + e \u2212 collision point. Fig. 1 shows the M bc distributions for CP-tagged signal candidates, summed over all CP-even and CP-odd tags, respectively, where the CP-tag final state does not contain a K 0 L meson. Many K 0 L mesons produced do not deposit any reconstructible signal in the detector. However, double-tag candidates can be fully reconstructed using a missing-mass squared (M 2 miss ) technique [27] for tags containing a single K 0 L meson. Yields are extracted from the signal and sideband regions of the M 2 miss distribution. Fig. 2 shows the M 2 miss distributions for candidates tagged with either a K 0 S mass. The selected sample of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 vs. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 candidates contains a significant combinatoric background from continuum e + e \u2212 \u2192 u\u016b, dd events that hadronise to six pions. Furthermore, this combinatoric background does not follow a uniform distribution in M bc as in the other double-tag modes. Therefore, an alternative strategy is used to determine the signal yield. A maximum-likelihood fit to the distribution of the average M bc of the two D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 candidates is used to determine the signal yield. The probability density functions (PDFs) are parametrised by a Crystal Ball function [28] and a threshold ARGUS function [29] for the signal and combinatoric background components, respectively. Apart from the signal yield all other parameters of the signal PDF are fixed to those obtained from the signal MC sample. All parameters for the background PDF are obtained from the fit to data. The average M bc distribution for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 vs. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 candidates is shown in Fig. 3(a), along with the result of the fit.

Therefore inclusive final states such as h + h \u2212 \u03c0 0 may be cleanly interpreted in terms of \u03b3 and the other parameters of interest, provided that F + is known. At leading order the only difference that the CP asymmetry A F + has with respect to the pure CP-eigenstate case is a dilution factor of (2F + \u2212 1), which is 0.936 \u00b1 0.036 for D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and 0.462 \u00b1 0.124 for D \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The measurement of F + presented here assumes a uniform acceptance across the Dalitz plot; any non-uniformity is considered as a potential source of systematic uncertainty. Therefore, any non-uniformity of the acceptance over the Dalitz plot for an experiment determining R F + and A F + must be corrected for, if necessary, and a suitable systematic uncertainty assigned.",

Measurements of F + , the fractional CP-even content of each decay have been performed. Values of F + (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.968 \u00b1 0.017 \u00b1 0.006 and F + (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.731 \u00b1 0.058 \u00b1 0.021 are obtained, where the first uncertainty is statistical, and the second is systematic. It has been demonstrated that such self-conjugate inclusive channels can be cleanly included in measurements of the unitarity-triangle angle \u03b3 , using B \u2213 \u2192 D K \u2213 decays. The high value of F + obtained for D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 makes this channel, in particular, a valuable addition to the suite of D-decay modes used in the measurement of \u03b3 at LHCb and Belle-II. Furthermore, given the large branching fraction, the D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 state can provide an additional source of CP-even tags for quantum-correlated measurements at the \u03c8(3770). The sample of D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 tags would be approximately twice as large as the D \u2192 h + h \u2212 sample. However, the formalism needs to be adjusted to incorporate F + to account for the small CP-odd component in the final state. Improved precision on the F + parameters can be obtained using the larger \u03c8(3770) data set available at BESIII, and similar measurements can also be performed for other self-conjugate final states.",
