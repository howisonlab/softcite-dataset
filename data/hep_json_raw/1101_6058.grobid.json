The fit yields a signal of 19 \u00b1 6(stat) \u00b1 3(syst) resonance events, and resonance mass and width of 4143.4 +2.9 \u22123.0 (stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst) MeV/c 2 and 15.3 +10.4 \u22126.1 (stat) \u00b1 2.5(syst) MeV/c 2 respectively. The parameters of this resonance-like structure are consistent with values reported from an earlier CDF analysis.",

The recent discoveries of states with charmonium-like decay modes [2][3][4][5] that do not fit into the overall charmonium system have introduced challenges to the conventional qq meson model. The possible interpretations beyond qq such as hybrid (qqg) and four-quark states (qqqq) have revitalized interest in exotic mesons in the charm sector [6][7][8][9][10][11].",

Charge conjugation is implied throughout this letter. Since the mass of this state, termed Y (4140), is well beyond the threshold of open charm-pair production, the expected branching fraction into this channel for conventional charmonium is tiny. The structure is the first observed charmonium-like object decaying into a pair of quarkonium states (cc and ss) with a relative narrow width, a possible signature for an exotic meson [7,11,13,14]. The Belle collaboration has searched for this J/\u03c8 \u03c6 structure without a firm conclusion near the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 threshold [15].",

The COT and silicon-strip vertex detector are used for the measurement of charged-particle trajectories and decay locations. In addition, the COT provides ionization energy loss information, dE/dx, used for kaon discrimination, while the TOF system provides complementary kaon discrimination information. The central muon identification system is located radially outside the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and consists of two sets of drift chambers and scintillation counters. The central detector covers the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| \u2264 0.6 and detects muons with p T \u2265 1.4 GeV/c [17], and the outer part covers the region 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 1.0 and detects muons with p T \u2265 2.0 GeV/c.",

Top-data from Ref.[12], bottom-new data. (b) A fit to the combined data assuming Y (4140) only. (c) A fit to the combined data assuming two structures. This fit, including the second peak, lowers the 3-body phase space background under the first peak and increases its yield and significance with negligible effect on its resonance parameters. The shaded histogram is the data from the B sideband. The dotted blue curve is the predicted background contribution, the dash-dotted black curve is the predicted B 0 s contamination, and the solid red curve is the total unbinned fit.",
