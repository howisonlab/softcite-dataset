Particularly relevant is the case where the decay of a heavy hypothetical resonance produces high-p T top quarks that decay hadronically.

Similarly, studies of top-quark production at the Tevatron have been limited to top quarks with p T < 300 GeV/c [26][27][28]. The large data samples collected by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab pp Tevatron Collider permit study of jets with p T greater than 400 GeV/c and their internal structure. At the same time, the-oretical progress has been made in the understanding of the production of massive jets, and the differential top-quark pair (t t) production cross section as a function of p T is now known up to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) [29,30] and full NNLO [31] expansion in the strong interaction coupling constant \u03b1 s .",

The distribution of the mass of a QCD jet has a maximum, m peak , comparable to a small fraction of the momentum of the jet, followed by a long tail that, depending on the jet algorithm used, could extend up to values that are a significant fraction of the p T of the jet. Based on QCD factorization (see, e.g., [32]), a semi-analytic calculation of the QCD jet-mass distribution has been derived for this high-mass tail where the jet mass, m jet , is dominated by a single gluon emission [33]. The probability of such gluon emission is given by the jet functions J q and J g for quarks and gluons, respectively. These are defined via the total double-differential cross section",

The solenoidal charged-particle spectrometer provides charged-particle momentum measurement over |\u03b7| < 1.5. A superconducting magnet generates an axial field of 1.416 T. The charged particles are tracked with a set of silicon microstrip detectors arranged in a barrel geometry around the collision point. This is followed by a cylindrical drift chamber, the central outer tracker (COT), that provides charged-particle tracking from a radius of 40 to 137 cm. Measurement of E T is made by summing vectorially the energy deposits in each calorimeter tower for towers with |\u03b7| < 3.6 and forming a missing energy vector. We take E T as the magnitude of the vector. The relative resolution of this quantity is proportional to 1/ \u2211 E T , where E T is in GeV and the sum is over the transverse energy observed in all calorimeter towers. This has been determined by studies of events with and without significant missing transverse energy [53]. A measure of how large the observed E T in an event is relative to its uncertainty is provided by the E T significance, defined as",

For example, the shift in jet mass from a single particle is inversely proportional to the mass of the jet, while the overall shift in mass from a collection of low-energy particles is predicted to increase as R 4 , where R is the jet cluster radius [3]. We are able to discriminate the effect of the underlying event alone by measuring the number of primary interactions (N vtx ) and then separately consider events with N vtx = 1 from events with N vtx > 1. Jets in N vtx = 1 events would only be affected by underlying event (UE) while jets in events with N vtx > 1 would be affected by both UE and multiple interactions (UEMI).",

We then define a complementary cone in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space of the same radius as the jet cones and at the same \u03b7 as the leading jet, but rotated in azimuth by \u00b1\u03c0/2.

We then add these energy deposits to the jet using the standard four-vector recombination scheme and calculate a new jet mass, m new , and a mass shift, m new \u2212 m old . We then calculate the average mass shift as a function of jet mass for the entire data sample. The upward shifts in jet mass for events with one and more than one interaction are estimates of the UE and UEMI effect, respectively, and can be used to statistically remove this effect from the observed jets.",

Both corrections are assumed to have a 1/m jet dependence, as expected from kinematic considerations, rising to a maximum around jet masses of approximately 30 GeV/c 2 . The UE and UEMI corrections differ by approximately a factor of two. The average number of primary interactions for this sample is approximately three per event, which would suggest a similar factor for the difference between corrections. However, the UE contribution is more energetic than a typical pp collision and is correlated with the jet, leading to a larger jet-mass correction. We parametrize both jet corrections with a 1/m jet dependence and an offset down to a jet mass of 30 GeV/c 2 . Below this value the correction is expected to vanish at zero mass (since a jet with an observed small mass cannot have experienced any significant increase in m jet from multiple interaction effects). We therefore chose a linear parametrization for m jet < 30 GeV/c 2 with an intercept at zero. This has no effect on the heavy jets which are the focus of this analysis.",

Given the clear clustering of the signal in this distribution, we define a signal region with both jet candidates having jet masses between 130 and 210 GeV/c 2 . We show in Fig. 17(b) the same distribution for the QCD MC sample, showing that the top quark signal and the QCD background are reasonably well-separated. The t t MC calculation predicts that 11.2% of the top quark events with at least one top quark with p T > 400 GeV/c would have jets satisfying this selection. We expect to see 3.0 events in the signal region. Figure 17(c) shows the 2-dimensional jet-mass plot for the data. We expect that the mass of the two jets produced via QCD interactions would be largely uncorrelated [70]. No correlation (coefficient \u03c1 = 0.06) between the second-leading and leading jet masses is observed in the data or the PYTHIA QCD prediction. This is to be compared with the correlation in p T of the two leading jets of 0.64 for the data sample. In addition, studies of the mass distributions of the leading and second-leading jet in the PYTHIA MC events, comparing the m jet2 distributions when different m jet1 requirements are applied, confirm the lack of significant correlation. Theoretical studies, as discussed below, are used to estimate the effect of any correlations in m jet between the two leading QCD jets.",

A correlation may arise from instrumental effects, e.g., arising from the jet being incident on an uninstrumented region of the detector, resulting in a lower jet mass and increased S MET . We have searched for such a correlation in the data set, and found no evidence for such instrumental effects. We therefore perform a data-driven background calculation similar to that used for the 1+1 candidates. We define Region E to be m jet1 \u2208 (30, 50) GeV/c 2 and S MET \u2208 (2, 3) GeV 1/2 , Region F as m jet1 \u2208 (130, 210) GeV/c 2 and S MET \u2208 (2, 3) GeV 1/2 , Region G to be m jet1 \u2208 (30, 50) GeV/c 2 and S MET \u2208 (4, 10) GeV 1/2 , and Region H to be the signal region. Region E contains 256 events, Region F contains 42 events and Region G contains 191 events. We predict 31.3 \u00b1 5.7 (stat) events in Region H (the signal region). We verified that the result is robust against reasonable variations in the definitions of the four regions, providing further confirmation that the two variables used are not correlated in this sample.",

The agreement between the QCD Monte Carlo calculations using PYTHIA 6.216, the analytic theoretical calculations and the observed data for jet masses greater than 70 GeV/c 2 , indicates that these theoretical models reproduce satisfactorily the data and may be used to extrapolate backgrounds arising from light quark and gluon jets in searches for new phenomena at the LHC. The measurements of the angularity of QCD jets produced with masses in excess of 90 GeV/c 2 show that these are consistent with the NLO prediction of two-body structure, and the planar flow distribution for jets with masses between 130 and 210 GeV/c 2 show similar consistency with QCD predictions.",
