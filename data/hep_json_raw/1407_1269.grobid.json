New values for the CPT asymmetry in the B 0 and B 0 s systems are deduced from published BaBar, Belle and LHCb results. With dedicated analyses, LHCb will be able to further improve the bounds on CPT violation in the D 0 , B 0 and B 0 s systems. Since CPT violation implies violation of Lorentz invariance in an interacting local quantum field theory, the observed CPT asymmetry will exhibit sidereal-and boost-dependent variations. Such CPT-violating and Lorentz-violating effects are accommodated in the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME). The large boost of the neutral mesons produced at LHCb results in a high sensitivity to the corresponding SME coefficients. For the B 0 and B 0 s systems, using existing LHCb results, we determine with high precision the SME coefficients that are not varying with sidereal time. With a full sidereal analysis, LHCb will be able to improve the existing SME bounds in the D 0 , B 0 and B 0 s systems by up to two orders of magnitude.",

Nevertheless, the combined CPT transformation is observed to be an exact fundamental symmetry of nature. From a theoretical perspective, CPT symmetry is required by any Lorentz-invariant, local quantum field theory. Many experimental searches for CPT violation have been performed over the last decades. Interferometry in the particle-antiparticle mixing of neutral mesons is a natural and very sensitive method to search to deviations from CPT invariance. Since most CPT tests have been performed with neutral kaons, progress can still be made in the D 0 , B 0 and B 0 s systems. As CPT violation implies Lorentz violation in an interacting local quantum field theory [1], any CPT-violating observable must also break Lorentz invariance. In the framework of the Standard Model Extension [2,3] (SME), spontaneous CPT violation and Lorentz invariance violation appear in a low-energy effective field theory. In this sense, small CPT-violating effects at low energies provide a window to the quantum gravity scale [4]. Such effects are expected to be suppressed by m 2 /M Pl , with M Pl \u2248 10 19 GeV the Planck * Corresponding author.

The Lorentz violation introduces a boost-and direction-dependent variation in the CPT-violating parameters. From an experimental point of view, the direction dependence results in a modulation with the sidereal phase. Such modulations would provide an unambiguous signature of CPT violation.",

We ignored for simplicity small effects coming from CP violation in kaon and B 0 mixing and direct CP violation due to the penguin contributions. The contribution from direct CP violation gives the dominant uncertainty on C f and therefore on the determination of Re(z). Theoretically, it is estimated to be at most a few times 10 \u22123 [27]. Experimentally, the direct CP asymmetry in B + \u2192 J /\u03c8 K + decays is (0.3 \u00b1 0.6)% [18], which is expected to be largely equal to that in B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K 0 S decays using isospin symmetry [28]. Another experimental constraint comes from the B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 0 decay, which can be used to determine the direct CP violation in B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K 0 S to be (1 \u00b1 1)% [29].

Then, this measurement translates to Re(z) = (1.9 \u00b1 6.8)%, where the uncertainty from the factor Re(\u03bb)/|\u03bb| is negligible. This result was left unnoticed in the PDG world average of Re(z) [18]. Averaging here both numbers, we find Re(z) = (1.9 \u00b1 4.0)%. Both results neglect the possible contribution from direct CP violation. A more recent and accurate value on Re(z) can actually be obtained using the world average on the cosine coefficient of (0.5 \u00b1 1.7)% [12]. With Re(\u03bb)/|\u03bb| \u2248 0.72 and setting C f = 0, this results in Re(z) = (0.7 \u00b1 2.4)%.",

For instance, CPT asymmetries for B 0 mixing are constructed by simultaneously interchanging the time ordering of initial B 0 and B 0 decays and substituting K 0 L and K 0 S states. Although this method is statistically not competitive, it does allow to cleanly separate effects from CP, T and CPT violation. Unfortunately, such tests are only possible at the \u03a5 (4S) experiments, and not at hadron collider experiments where the B 0 mesons are produced incoherently and the reconstruction of K 0 L mesons is much more challenging.",

At LHCb, with their large sample of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays and assuming a comparable boost factor, it should be possible to improve the FOCUS bounds by a factor 40. Note, however, that it will not be possible to constrain Re(z) to be smaller than one, since Re(z) is suppressed in Eq.(11)by O(10 \u22126 ). Nevertheless, no assumptions on the smallness of |z| have been made so far. Extrapolating to the statistically larger sample, LHCb should be able to reach a sensitivity on the a \u03bc parameters of about 1 \u00d7 10 \u221214 GeV.3.3. B 0 mesonsDue to the small value of \u0393 d in the B 0 system, decays to flavour-specific final states are sensitive to Im(z), while decays to CP eigenstates are sensitive to Re(z) (cf. Eqs. (4) and(6)). This is a key point that is used below for B 0 decays, but it is also valid for B 0 s decays. Using only dilepton (i.e., flavour-specific) final states, the BaBar Collaboration published Im(z) = (\u22121.39 \u00b1 0.80)%[22]. Similarly, the Belle Collaboration reported Im(z) = (\u22120.57 \u00b1 0.47)%, mainly using flavour-specific final states[11]. The average value of both results is Im(z) = (\u22120.8 \u00b1 0.4)%[18]. Using the same dilepton final states, the BaBar Collaboration also reported a measurement of Re(z) \u0393 d = (\u22127.1 \u00b1 4.4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 ps \u22121[22]. When inserting the theoretical expectation of \u0393 d \u2248 \u2212(2.7 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22123 ps \u22121[23], this measurement gives only a weak constraint on Re(z) of O(2). Since",
