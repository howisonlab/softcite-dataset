Upper limits on the cross sections between ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 3.80 and 5.56 GeV are determined at the 90% credibility level, which range from a few pb to a few tens of pb.

Three charmoniumlike states with J PC \u00bc 1 \u2212\u2212 were discovered at B factories via initial state radiation (ISR) in the last decade: the Y\u00f04260\u00de in e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 J=\u03c8 [1,2] and the Y\u00f04360\u00de and Y\u00f04660\u00de in e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de [3,4].

Some of these states show unusual properties that are inconsistent with charmonium [6]. It is unlikely that all of these states are charmonia; some, perhaps, have exotic nature: a multiquark state, molecule, hybrid, or some other configuration. To improve our understanding of these states and the underlying QCD, it is important to investigate them using much larger data samples and new decay channels.",

The limited statistics prevented them from measuring the line shape of e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ . The BESIII experiment reports the upper limits on the cross sections of the reactions e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 and e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 at four energy points: ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 4.009, 4.230, 4.260, and 4.360 GeV [8]. With the full Belle data sample, we are able to study this process via ISR. In this paper, we report a study of the e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ process using ISR events detected with the Belle detector [9] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e \u00fe e \u2212 collider [10]. Here, \u03c7 cJ is reconstructed in the \u03b3J=\u03c8 final state and J=\u03c8 is reconstructed in the \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 final state alone (the background level is very high in the e \u00fe e \u2212 final state due to Bhabha events). The same final state \u03b3\u03b3J=\u03c8 has been previously analyzed at Belle and \u03c8\u00f04040\u00de and \u03c8\u00f04160\u00de were observed as \u03b7J=\u03c8 resonances [11]. We study the full Belle data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 980 fb \u22121 . About 70% of the data was collected at the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance, and the remainder was taken at the other \u03d2\u00f0nS\u00de (n \u00bc 1, 2, 3, or 5) states or at CM energies a few tens of MeV lower than the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de or the \u03d2\u00f0nS\u00de peaks.",

The mass and width of V can be varied so that we can obtain the signal efficiency as a function of the vector meson mass. This model considers the leading-order (LO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction only and thus higher-order corrections should be estimated and properly taken into account. The dedicated ISR generator PHOKHARA [13] has the next-toleading-order (NLO) QED correction but does not contain the mode of interest. However, the process e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR V \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03b7J=\u03c8 can be generated with PHOKHARA and this allows us to estimate the NLO correction effect in the mode under study by comparing the results from the two generators in the analysis of the \u03b7J=\u03c8 mode.

Clear signals due to \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 are observed with very low background and we fit this photon energy distribution to extract the corresponding yields. The \u03c7 cJ signal shapes are obtained from Monte Carlo simulated signal samples convolved with a corresponding smearing Gaussian function to compensate   for the resolution difference between data and Monte Carlo simulation; the background is parametrized as a first-order Chebyshev polynomial. The resulting fit function is shown in Fig. 5 and the fit yields 340 AE 20 \u03c7 c1 and 97 AE 12 \u03c7 c2 signal events.

We extract the transition rate of the vector charmonium and charmoniumlike states to \u03b3\u03c7 cJ by fitting the distributions in Fig. 6. We use a Breit-Wigner function for the signal and a first-or second-order polynomial function for the background. While doing the fit, the mass and total width are fixed to the world-average values [17] and \u0393 ee \u00d7 B\u00f0R \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ \u00de is scanned from zero to a large number at which the probability is less than 1.0% of the largest value. Normalized probability density functions are derived from such a scan. These probability density functions then give the upper limits at 90% C.L. as listed in Table II. Taking \u0393 ee \u00bd\u03c8\u00f04040\u00de and \u0393 ee \u00bd\u03c8\u00f04415\u00de from the world-average values [17] and \u0393 ee \u00bd\u03c8\u00f04160\u00de from the BES II measurement [20], we set the upper limits on the branching fractions for these three conventional charmonium states as listed in Table III. Taking \u0393 ee \u00bdY\u00f04260\u00de\u00d7B\u00bdY\u00f04260\u00de\u2192\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 J=\u03c8\u00bc \u00f06.4AE0.8AE0.6\u00de eV or \u00f020.5 AE 1.4 AE 2.0\u00de eV [19] [there 1 In common high energy physics usage, this Bayesian interval has been reported as \"confidence interval\" which is a frequentiststatistics term.",

The uncertainty in the tracking efficiency for tracks with angles and momenta characteristic of signal events is about 0.35% per track [11] and is additive. The uncertainty due to particle identification efficiency is 1.9%. The uncertainties of J=\u03c8 mass and \u03c7 cJ mass requirements are estimated using the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de sample in the same analysis and are found to be 1% and 1.3%, respectively. The generator EVTGEN is used in generating signal MC events. In this generator, however, only one ISR photon is allowed and the higher-order ISR effect should be estimated and corrected. This effect is studied by using a control sample e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de with \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de decaying into \u03b7J=\u03c8. This process can be generated with both EVTGEN and PHOKHARA, a generator with higher-order ISR corrections. We assume that the correction factor obtained in this mode is the same as in the mode under study, and 9.0% is taken as the systematic error, corresponding to the uncertainty in the difference between the measured B\u00f0\u03c8\u00f02S\u00de \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J=\u03c8\u00de and the world average [17]. Taking the statistical error of the MC samples and the possible uncertainty in simulating the angular distributions of the full decay chain \u03b3\u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J=\u03c8 into account, we quote a total uncertainty due to the generator as 12%. Belle measures luminosity with 1.4% precision and the trigger efficiency is about 91% with an uncertainty of 2%. Errors on the branching fractions of the intermediate states are taken from Ref. [17] with a systematic error of 4.5%. Assuming that these systematic error sources are independent, the total systematic error is 13.4%. The systematic uncertainty is considered in the upper limits shown in Tables I-IV.  In summary, using the full Belle data sample, we measure the e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ process via initial state radiation. For the CM energy between 3.80 and 5.56 GeV, there are no significant e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 and \u03b3\u03c7 c2 signals. The upper limits on the e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ production cross sections, which range from a few pb to a few tens of pb, are set for the first time and are listed in Table I. We also set upper limits on the decay rate of the vector charmonium and charmoniumlike states to \u03b3\u03c7 cJ . This information may help in understanding the nature of these vector states. ",
