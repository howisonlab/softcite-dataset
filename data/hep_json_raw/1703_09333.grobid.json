Because heavy-flavor production is dominated by gluon-gluon interactions at \u221a s = 200 GeV, these measurements offer a unique opportunity to obtain information on the trigluon correlation functions. The measurements are performed at forward and backward rapidity (1.4 < |y| < 2.0) over the transverse momentum range of 1.25 < pT < 7 GeV/c for the cross section and 1.25 < pT < 5 GeV/c for the asymmetry measurements. The obtained cross section is compared to a fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative-quantumchromodynamics calculation. The asymmetry results are consistent with zero within uncertainties, and a model calculation based on twist-3 three-gluon correlations agrees with the data.",

            "text": "Transverse single-spin asymmetry (TSSA) phenomena have gained substantial attention in both experimental and theoretical studies in recent years. The existence of TSSAs has been well established in the production of light mesons at forward rapidity in transversely polarized p+p collisions at energies ranging from the Zero Gradient Synchrotron up to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Surprisingly large but oppositely-signed TSSA results were first observed in \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 production at large Feynman-x (x F ) in transversely polarized p+p collisions at \u221a s = 4.9 GeV [1]. These results surprised the quantum-chromodynamics (QCD) community because they disagreed with the expectation from the naive perturbative QCD of very small spin asymmetries [2]. The large TSSA of pion production has been subsequently observed in hadronic collisions over a range of energies extending up to \u221a s = 500 GeV for \u03c0 0 ( \u221a s = 200 GeV for \u03c0 \u00b1 ) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Furthermore, TSSA in \u03b7 meson production has also been studied at forward rapidity [13,14]. The results are consistent with the observed \u03c0 0 asymmetries at various energies in the overlapping x F regions. Two theoretical formalisms within the perturbative QCD framework have been proposed to explain the origin of these large TSSAs at forward rapidity. Both formalisms connect the TSSA to the transverse motion of the partons inside the transversely-polarized nucleon and/or to spin-dependent quark fragmentation.",

The final state contribution originates from the quark transversity distribution and the Collins [17] fragmentation function, which describes the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a final state hadron with nonzero transverse momentum relative to the parton direction. This framework requires two observed scales where only one needs to be hard and both effects have been observed in SIDIS measurements [18,19]. However, TMD factorization cannot be used in the interpretation of hadron production in p+p collisions as only one hard scale is available [20].",

PHENIX has measured the TSSA (A N ) of J/\u03c8 in central and forward rapidity [24]. Theoretical predictions of the J/\u03c8 single-spin asymmetry are complicated by the lack of good understanding of J/\u03c8 production mechanism [25]. In addition, there are feed-down contributions from higher resonance states in inclusive J/\u03c8 production [26]. On the other hand, the effect of pure gluonic correlation functions on D-meson production in transversely polarized p+p collisions has been extensively studied within the twist-3 mechanism in the framework of collinear factorization [27,28]. However, it is difficult to constrain the trigluon correlation functions due to the lack of experimental results. Future measurements including D-meson production are proposed at the Large Hadron Collider [29].",

Two polarimeters are used to determine the beam polarizations. One is a hydrogen-jet polarimeter, which takes several hours to measure the absolute polarization [34]. The other is a fast, proton-carbon polarimeter which measures relative changes in the magnitude of the polarization and any variations across the transverse profile of the beam several times per fill [35,36]. During the \u221a s = 200 GeV run in 2012, the polarization direction in the PHENIX interaction region was transverse. The average clockwisebeam (known as blue beam) polarization for the data used in this analysis was P = 0.64\u00b10.03, and the average counter-clockwise-beam (yellow beam) polarization was P = 0.59\u00b10.03.

The contribution of muons from J/\u03c8 to the muons from inclusive heavy-flavor decays is \u223c 2% at low p T and increases up to \u223c 20% at p T > 5 GeV/c. Because there is a B \u2192 J/\u03c8 contribution in the inclusive J/\u03c8 measurement, a fraction of B is included in N J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 and subtracted as background. However, the fraction, N B\u2192J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 /N HF , is quite small based on the measurements of the B \u2192 J/\u03c8 fraction [46]. Figure 2 shows the p T spectra of inclusive muon tracks and estimated background components; the relative contribution from each source varies with p T . After subtraction of backgrounds from light hadrons and J/\u03c8, the p T spectra of muons from open heavy-flavor decays can be obtained.

Vertical bars (boxes) around the data points are statistical (systematic) uncertainties; details on systematic uncertainties will be described in the following section. Because K + has a longer nuclear interaction length than other light hadrons, the signal-to-background ratio of positively-charged tracks is smaller than that of negatively-charged tracks. ",

In addition, the modification of A N due to azimuthal smearing from the D-decay is quite small (< 5% relative difference between A D N and A \u00b5 N ) in p \u00b5 T > 1.25 GeV/c. One notes that muons from charm and bottom are combined in the data, and the contribution from bottom is about 2% (55%) at p T = 1 GeV/c (5 GeV/c) according to the FONLL calculation shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, the charm contribution is expected to be dominant except for the last p T bin of A \u00b5 N (3.5 < p T < 5 GeV/c). In addition, subprocesses other than gluon-fusion can contribute to the measured yield of muons from heavy-flavor decays. The converted A N of muons from D mesons are shown in Fig. 5, 6, and 7, and both calculations are in agreement with the data within the statistical uncertainties. The difference between two models becomes larger at increasing |x F |, but it is hard to distinguish these two models due to the limited x F coverage for this measurement ( |x \u00b5 F | =0.04, 0.07).",

The contribution from other sources is negligible as discussed in Sec. III B 2. To obtain the asymmetry of muons from open heavy-flavor decays (A HF N ), the asymmetry of the background from light hadrons (A h N ) and muons from J/\u03c8 (A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N ) should be eliminated from the asymmetry of inclusive muon candidates (A incl N ). Because hadron tracks can be selected with the p z cut, A h N is obtained from the asymmetry of stopped hadrons at MuID Gap3. Possible differences between the A N of stopped hadrons at MuID Gap3 and the mixture of decay muons and punch-through hadrons at MuID Gap4 is studied with the hadron-cocktail simulation. The details are described in Sec. III C 3. For the estimation of A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N , a previous PHENIX A J/\u03c8 N measurement [24] is used. The asymmetry of single muons from J/\u03c8 decay (A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N ) is estimated from a decay simulation with the initial A J/\u03c8 N in [24] (A J/\u03c8 N = \u22120.002 \u00b1 0.026 at x F < 0, and \u22120.026 \u00b1 0.026 at x F > 0). The initial p T and rapidity distributions of J/\u03c8 are taken from [26]. The obtained A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N is \u22120.002 +0.018 \u22120.022 at x F < 0 and \u22120.019 +0.019 \u22120.025 at x F > 0. A possible effect from J/\u03c8 polarization is tested by assuming maximum polarization, and the variation of A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N is < 0.001. Because the variation due to J/\u03c8 polarization is much smaller than the variation from the uncertainty of A J/\u03c8 N , the J/\u03c8 polarization effect is not included to evaluate A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N and the systematic uncertainty.

The final systematic uncertainty is calculated as the quadratic sum of systematic uncertainties from each source (\u03b4A \u03b4f h N , \u03b4A h N , \u03b4A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N , and \u03b4A method N ), described here: \u03b4A \u03b4f h N : Systematic uncertainty on the fraction of light-hadron background (\u03b4f h ) from Fig. 3 is an important source of systematic uncertainty on A HF N . The upper and lower limits of A HF N are calculated using Eq. (5) with the upper and lower limits of the fraction of the light-hadron background (f h \u00b1 \u03b4f h ).\u03b4A h N : The asymmetry of the light-hadron background (A h N ) at MuID Gap4 is estimated by using stopped hadrons at MuID Gap3. Due to decay kinematics, the A h N at MuID Gap4 can be different from the A h N measured at MuID Gap3. In order to quantify the difference, a simulation study using the decay kinematics of light hadrons from the hadron-cocktail in Sec. III B 2 and an input asymmetry (A input N ) is performed. A input N is taken as 0.02 \u00d7 p T (with p T in GeV/c) at p T < 5 GeV/c and 0.1 at p T > 5 GeV/c, based on the most extreme case of A h N measured at MuID Gap3. The detailed procedure is as follows: 1. Generate a random spin direction (\u2191,\u2193) for all tracks. 2. Apply a weight (1\u00b1A input N \u2022cos \u03c6 0 ) for each track based on the manually assigned initial asymmetry (A input N ). The sign is determined from the random polarization direction in step 1, and \u03c6 0 is the azimuthal angle of the track at the generation level. 3. Extract A reco N of the tracks at MuID Gap3 and Gap4 with the azimuthal angle and momentum of the reconstructed tracks by fitting the asymmetry of the two polarization cases with A reco N \u2022 cos \u03c6 0 . The largest difference between A reco N at MuID Gap3 and Gap4 is \u223c 0.008 in the entire p T range, so \u00b10.008 is assigned to the systematic uncertainty. In the case of x F binning, the difference of A reco N at MuID Gap3 and Gap4 is quite small (< 0.001). \u03b4A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N The systematic uncertainty from A J/\u03c8\u2192\u00b5 N is determined from the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 simulation with the upper and lower limits of A J/\u03c8 N in [24]. Propagation to A HF N is calculated using Eq. (5). The effect from B \u2192 J/\u03c8 is negligible due to its small fraction in the inclusive J/\u03c8. \u03b4A method N The A incl N results from the maximum likelihood method at Eq. (3) are compared with result using the polarization formula at Eq. (7). Because the measurement of A h N using tracks at MuID Gap3 suffer from large statistical fluctuations, the difference of two methods with inclusive tracks at MuID Gap4 is used for both A incl N and A h N variations using Eq. (5). A N (\u03c6) of inclusive tracks for each p T or x F bin is calculated as,",
