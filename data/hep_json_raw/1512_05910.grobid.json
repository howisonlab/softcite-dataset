Selected events have an isolated photon and a jet, each with transverse momentum above 150 GeV. No significant deviation of the \u03b3+jet invariant mass distribution from the backgroundonly hypothesis is found. Limits are set at 95% confidence level on the cross sections of generic Gaussian-shaped signals and of a few benchmark phenomena beyond the Standard Model: excited quarks with vector-like couplings to the Standard Model particles, and nonthermal quantum black holes in two models of extra spatial dimensions. The minimum excluded visible cross sections for Gaussian-shaped resonances with width-to-mass ratios of 2% decrease from about 6 fb for a mass of 1.5 TeV to about 0.8 fb for a mass of 5 TeV. The minimum excluded visible cross sections for Gaussian-shaped resonances with widthto-mass ratios of 15% decrease from about 50 fb for a mass of 1.5 TeV to about 1.0 fb for a mass of 5 TeV. Excited quarks are excluded below masses of 4.4 TeV, and non-thermal quantum black holes are excluded below masses of 3.8 (6.2) TeV for Randall-Sundrum (Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulous-Dvali) models with one (six) extra dimensions.",

As a consequence, the LHC could produce quantum black holes (QBH) with masses near M * [7,8], which would then decay before thermalizing, producing low-multiplicity final states [9,10]. The RS1 model studied in this article has n = 1 extra dimensions. For the ADD model, the same benchmark scenario (n = 6) is investigated as in the previous ATLAS publication [11]. In this article it is also assumed that the mass threshold for black hole production is equal to the Planck scale, M th = M * . The maximum mass for black hole production, which in any case cannot exceed the pp centre-of-mass energy, is set to 3M * (when M * < \u221a s/3), to avoid the high-mass regime in which a classical description of the black hole should replace the quantum one. A continuum of black holes with invariant masses between the threshold mass and the maximum mass can therefore be produced, with a probability rapidly decreasing with the mass. The total expected production cross sections times decay branching ratios for pp \u2192 QBH + X \u2192 \u03b3 + q/g + X as a function of the threshold mass, assuming that all QBHs decay to two-body final states and summing over all parton types in the initial and final state, are shown in figure 1. These cross sections were obtained with the QBH 2.02 event generator [12]. At \u221a s = 13 TeV the predicted total production cross section times branching ratio is 1.4 fb (390 fb) for RS1 (ADD) black holes with M th = 4 TeV.",

Despite the six times smaller integrated luminosity at \u221a s = 13 TeV, the sensitivity of the present search to the q * and QBH signals exceeds the exclusion limits obtained with 8 TeV data. This is due to the significant growth of the q * and QBH production cross section with the increase of the pp centre-of-mass energy from 8 TeV to 13 TeV. For instance, for a mass of 5 TeV, the production cross sections rise by more than two orders of magnitude for both the q * and QBHs, while the background cross section increases by less than an order of magnitude.",

The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field and by a high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter. The EM calorimeter measures the energy and the position of electromagnetic showers with |\u03b7| < 3.2. It includes a presampler (for |\u03b7| < 1.8) and three sampling layers, longitudinal in shower depth, up to |\u03b7| = 2.5. The hadronic calorimeter, surrounding the electromagnetic one and covering |\u03b7| < 4.9, is a sampling calorimeter which uses either scintillator tiles or LAr as the active medium, and steel, copper or tungsten as the absorber material. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, each with eight coils, a system of precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7), and fast tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.4) for triggering.",

The \u03b3 + jet candidate with the highest m \u03b3j value has an invariant mass of 2.87 TeV. A small contamination from dijet events is expected, due to jets misidentified as photons in the calorimeter. Such fake candidates typically arise from jets containing a neutral meson (most likely a \u03c0 0 ) carrying a large fraction of the jet energy and decaying into two collimated photons. These candidates are on average less isolated from activity in the neighbouring cells of the calorimeters and have on average wider shower shapes in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The purity of true photon+jet events in the selected sample is estimated to be around 93% by means of a two-dimensional sideband method based on the numbers of photon+jet candidates in which the photon either passes anti-isolation requirements, anti-identification requirements, or both [27], thus indicating that the dijet contamination is rather small. For the purity measurement a photon candidate is considered non-isolated if its isolation transverse energy is at least 3 GeV larger than the maximum allowed E \u03b3 T,iso for a photon to be regarded as isolated. A photon candidate is non-identified if it fails at least one of the requirements on four shower shape variables computed from the energy deposited in the finely segmented cells of the first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter. No evidence of a dependence of the photon purity on the \u03b3 + jet invariant mass is observed. Figure 2 shows the comparison between the m \u03b3j distribution of events selected in data and the shapes predicted by Sherpa and Jetphox for SM \u03b3 + jet production, neglecting the dijet contribution. The bin width rises from 100 GeV to 300 GeV with increasing m \u03b3j , to account for the corresponding decrease in the number of data events and increase in the intrinsic width of most of the signals considered in this study. The simulated spectra from Sherpa and Jetphox are normalized to the data in the range 0.5 TeV< m \u03b3j <2.5 TeV. The shapes of the m \u03b3j distributions in data and simulation agree in the range studied. The agreement is better for Sherpa, due to the inclusion of hadronization and underlying-event effects and of the detector response.",

Some examples of expected signals overlaid on the fitted background are also shown, for (a) a q * with a mass of 3.8 TeV (red dashed line) and an RS1 (n = 1) QBH with a threshold mass of 4 TeV (orange dotted line) and (b) an ADD (n = 6) QBH with a threshold mass of 6 TeV (red dashed line).
