Prompt-photon production is understood to proceed via two processes: the one in which the photon arises directly from the hard interaction (the direct-photon process) and the one in which the photon is emitted in the fragmentation of a high transverse momentum (p T ) parton (the fragmentation-photon process) [1,2].",

            "text": "Measurements of inclusive prompt-photon production also provide benchmarks to use in investigating novel approaches to parton radiation [12], next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections with matched parton showers [13], the relevance of threshold logarithms in QCD and electroweak corrections [14] and NNLO QCD corrections [15][16][17]. More specifically, the production of prompt photons, which is less sensitive to hadronisation effects than that of jets, can be used to pursue an alternative QCD description based on the k T factorisation approach combining off-shell amplitudes and transverse-momentum-dependent parton densities [12]. The prompt-photon data allow the investigation of the fragmentation contribution, which can be done either via fragmentation functions or through the inclusion of parton showers [13]. Electroweak corrections are likely to play an important role at the TeV scale and, thereby, measurements at photon transverse energies in that region would help to unveil such phenomena [14]. The prompt-photon measurements at the LHC are characterised by small uncertainties that demand precise theoretical predictions, e.g. those from NNLO QCD calculations [15][16][17], in order to fully exploit these data. Measurements involving isolated photons have also been used to constrain the contributions from new light scalar particles decaying into a photon pair [18]. This paper presents a measurement of isolated prompt-photon production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The differential cross section as a function of the photon transverse energy 1 (E \u03b3 T ) is measured in different regions of the photon pseudorapidity (\u03b7 \u03b3 ) for E \u03b3 T > 125 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, excluding the region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.56.

The measurement presented here is found to be consistent with the previous one in the overlapping kinematic regions. This increase in statistics allows improvements in the calibration of the photon energy and reductions in the experimental systematic uncertainties affecting the cross-section measurement, as well as an extension of the coverage in E \u03b3 T to higher values than previously measured. In this analysis, the region where the measurement is limited by systematic uncertainties is extended to E \u03b3 T \u223c 1 TeV, beyond what was achieved in the previous measurement. The NLO QCD predictions of Jetphox [19,20] and Sherpa [21] based on several parameterisations of the PDFs are compared with the measurement. The NNLO QCD prediction of Nnlojet [16], which has significantly reduced uncertainties due to fewer missing higher-order terms, is also confronted with the data. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The transverse energy is defined as ET = E sin \u03b8, where E is the energy and \u03b8 is the polar angle. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2) and the angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector [22][23][24] is a multipurpose detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry. It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The inner-detector system is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector is closest to the interaction region and provides four measurements per track. The pixel detector is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four three-dimensional space point measurements per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by the transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2. The calorimeter system covers the range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters; for |\u03b7| < 2.5, the EM calorimeter is divided into three layers in depth. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid-angle coverage is completed out to |\u03b7| = 4.9 with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are optimised for EM and hadronic measurements, respectively. Events are selected using a first-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [25].",

Fragmentation into hadrons is described by the Lund string model [31] in the case of Pythia and by a modified version of the cluster model [32] in the case of Sherpa. The proton's structure was parameterised by the LO NNPDF2.3 [33] PDF set for Pythia and by the NLO CT10 [34] PDF set for Sherpa. All samples include a simulation of the underlying event (UE), with parameter values set according to the ATLAS 2014 tune series (A14 tune) for Pythia [35] or to the tune developed by the authors of Sherpa for use in conjunction with the NLO CT10 PDF set. The Pythia simulation of the signal includes LO photon-plus-jet events from direct processes (the hard subprocesses qg \u2192 q\u03b3 and qq \u2192 g\u03b3, called the 'hard' component) and photon bremsstrahlung in LO QCD dijet events (called the 'bremsstrahlung' component). The bremsstrahlung component is modelled by final-state QED radiation arising from calculations of all 2 \u2192 2 QCD processes. The Sherpa samples were generated with LO matrix elements for photon-plus-jet final states with up to three additional partons (2 \u2192 n processes with n from 2 to 5); the matrix elements were merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@LO prescription [36]. The bremsstrahlung component is accounted for in Sherpa through the matrix elements of 2 \u2192 n processes with n \u2265 3. In the generation of the Sherpa samples, a requirement on the photon isolation at the matrixelement level is imposed using the criterion defined in ref. [37]. This criterion, commonly called Frixione's criterion, requires the total transverse energy inside a cone of size r in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane around the generated final-state photon, excluding the photon itself, to be below a certain threshold,",

            "text": "Photon candidates are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposited in the EM calorimeter and classified [46] as unconverted photon candidates (clusters without a matching track or without a matching reconstructed conversion vertex in the inner detector) or converted photon candidates (clusters with a matching reconstructed conversion vertex or a matching track consistent with originating from a photon conversion). The main background in the prompt-photon production measurement comes from an energetic \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 meson which is misidentified as a photon because it decays into an almost collinear photon pair. Such energetic \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 mesons are produced copiously inside jets. This background is reduced by the photon identification criteria and by requiring the photon candidate to be isolated. Photon candidates are identified by using variables that characterise the lateral and longitudinal electromagnetic shower development in the EM calorimeter and the energy fraction leaking into the hadronic calorimeter. Tight requirements are imposed on the shower shapes in the second layer and in the finely segmented first layer of the EM calorimeter as well as on the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter [46]. These requirements are optimised separately for unconverted and converted photon candidates and ensure the compatibility of the measured shower profile with that originating from a single photon impacting the calorimeter. Small differences in the average values of the showershape variables between data and simulation are observed and corrected for in simulated events prior to the application of the photon identification criteria. Three data-driven methods based on radiative Z decays, electron extrapolation and an inclusive sample of photon candidates [46] are used to measure the efficiency of the tight identification criteria. The results of the three methods agree in the overlapping kinematic regions and the measured efficiencies are above 90% (95%) for unconverted (converted) photon candidates with E \u03b3 T > 125 GeV. Efficiency scale factors are evaluated as the ratios of the measured efficiencies to the efficiencies obtained in simulation and are applied to photon candidates in simulated events. The resulting efficiency scale factors are compatible with unity and have uncertainties in the range 1%-3%, depending on E \u03b3 T and \u03b7 \u03b3 . The photon isolation requirement is based on the amount of transverse energy (E iso T ) inside a cone of size \u2206R = 0.4 around the photon candidate, excluding an area of size \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.125 \u00d7 0.175 centred on the barycentre of the photon cluster. The measured value of E iso T is computed from topological clusters of calorimeter cells [47] and is corrected for the expected leakage of the photon energy into the isolation cone as well as for the 2 The single-photon trigger with the threshold of 120 GeV was kept unprescaled during 2015 whereas it had to be prescaled during 2016 due to the increase in instantaneous luminosity. 3 The discriminating variables used for 'loose' and 'tight' photon identification can be found in table 1 of ref.

The parameters are chosen to be as loose as possible to minimise a bias from the application of the photon isolation requirement at particle level. Since Frixione's criterion requires the upper limit on the transverse energy isolation to be exactly zero at r = 0, the criterion cannot be strictly looser than any non-zero photon isolation requirement at detector or particle level for all r < R. The photon isolation requirement is applied (see table 1) using the procedure described in section 6; the prescription employed is referred to as 'hybrid-cone isolation' [16,62] since it includes the application of the Frixione's criterion at a small value of \u2206R (R = 0.1) and the fixed-cone isolation at \u2206R = 0.4 used for the fiducial region of the measurement. Dynamic factorisation and renormalisation scales are adopted (E \u03b3 T ) as well as a dynamical merging scale withQ cut = 20 GeV [62]. The strong coupling constant is set to \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.118. The same prescription for the electromagnetic coupling as for the Jetphox prediction is used. Fragmentation into hadrons and simulation of the UE are performed using the same models as for the Sherpa samples of simulated events presented in section 3. The NNLO NNPDF3.0 PDF set is used in conjunction with the corresponding Sherpa tuning.",

The uncertainties in Jetphox associated with \u03b1 s are evaluated as the differences between the varied and the nominal cross sections scaled by a factor 1.5/2. This scaling factor accounts for the difference in \u03b1 s (m Z ) between the nominal and the \u03b1 s (m Z )-varied calculations (0.002) and the uncertainty in \u03b1 s (m Z ) (0.0015) recommended by the authors of MMHT2014 [67]. The uncertainties in Sherpa 2.2.2 due to \u03b1 s are evaluated as the differences between the varied and the nominal cross sections scaled by a factor 1.5 to match the prescription used for MMHT2014. The resulting uncertainties in the prediction of Jetphox (Sherpa 2.2.2) are less than 3% (6% except for the highest measured E \u03b3 T point in the region 1.81 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, where it increases to 12%). Since the NLO pQCD prediction from Jetphox is at the parton level while the measurement is at the particle level, correction factors for the non-perturbative (NP) effects of hadronisation and the underlying event are needed for the former to match the data. However, the data are corrected for pile-up and UE effects and the distributions are unfolded to a phase-space definition in which the requirement on E iso T at particle level is applied after subtraction of the UE. Therefore, corrections for NP effects are expected to be close to unity. They are evaluated by computing the ratio of the particle-level cross section for a Pythia sample with UE effects to the parton-level cross section without UE effects. The resulting corrections are consistent with unity within \u00b11%. Thus, no correction is applied to the NLO QCD prediction of Jetphox and an uncertainty of 1% is assigned. The Sherpa 2.2.2 prediction is based on particle-level observables after applying the requirements listed in table 1 and, therefore, can be compared directly with the measurement. Although no tunes are available to assess the impact of hadronisation and UE in the Sherpa 2.2.2 prediction, it is expected that the associated uncertainty is of a similar size as that evaluated using Pythia and, therefore, can be neglected in comparison to the other uncertainties.",

            "text": "The NLO QCD prediction of Jetphox is compared with the measurement in figures 6 and 7. The NLO QCD prediction from Sherpa 2.2.2 is also reported in figures 6 and 7 and is denoted by 'ME+PS@NLO QCD' to highlight the differences relative to the predictions from Jetphox discussed in section 8. The nominal prediction of Sherpa 2.2.2 is above that of Jetphox; this is attributed to the fact that the former includes contributions from parton showers, virtual corrections for \u03b3 + 2-jet and higher-order tree-level matrix elements for the processes 2 \u2192 n with n = 4 and 5, which are not present in the prediction of Jetphox. Both types of predictions adequately reproduce the dependence of the singleand double-differential cross section on E \u03b3 T and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | as observed in the data. Although the predictions are overall consistent with the measurement within the uncertainties, a detailed comparison is presented in terms of the ratios of theory predictions to data. The ratios of the predictions of Jetphox with \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = \u00b5 f = E \u03b3 T using different PDF sets to the measured cross section as a function of E \u03b3 T are shown in figures 8 and 9; the full theoretical uncertainty, including the variations of the scales, is shown for the prediction based on the MMHT2014 PDF set. The predictions based on the MMHT2014, CT14 and NNPDF3.0 PDF sets are similar and closest to the data for |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37 for most of the range in E \u03b3 T . For 1.56 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, the prediction based on the HERAPDF2.0 PDF set is closest to the data. The prediction based on the ABMP16 PDF set is further away from the data than that based on the MMHT2014 PDF set for E \u03b3 T 1 TeV in the region |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37. The prediction of Jetphox with \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = \u00b5 f = E \u03b3 T exhibits a tendency to underestimate the data over most of the measured range in E \u03b3 T . However, the prediction of Jetphox with a different choice for the scales, namely \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = \u00b5 f = E \u03b3 T /2, provides an improved description of the normalisation of the data, as can be seen in figure 10; the full theoretical uncertainty, including the variations of the scales with respect to E \u03b3 T /2, is shown for the prediction based on the MMHT2014 PDF set. The ratio of the prediction of Sherpa 2.2.2 to the measured cross section as a function of E \u03b3 T is also shown in figure 10. Good agreement is observed between this prediction and the data distribution. In general, the NLO pQCD predictions are consistent with the measurement within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.  The NNLO QCD prediction from Nnlojet, which represent a significant step forward in precision, is compared with the data in figures 6, 7, 11 and 12. The inclusion of the NNLO QCD corrections increases the normalisation of the prediction and significantly reduces the uncertainties due to the scale variations, which are dominant for NLO QCD calculations. With the described choice of the input parameters, the NNLO QCD prediction provides an excellent description of the data except in the region 1.56 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.81, where there is a tendency in the theory to underestimate the data. The improvements in the description of the data by the NNLO QCD prediction relative to that of NLO QCD are shown in figures 11 and 12.    Figure 8.

The symbols for the data are centred at unity and the inner (outer) error bars represent the relative data statistical uncertainties (statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature). The hatched bands represent the full theoretical uncertainty associated to the prediction based on the MMHT2014 PDF set, including the variations of the scales. For comparison, the predictions using the CT14 (dashed lines) and NNPDF3.0 (dotted lines) PDF sets are also included.  Figure 9.
