A signal would appear as an excess of events with high transverse mass, where the standard model background is low. No excess is observed. Limits are set on a model in which the W decays preferentially to fermions of the third generation. These results substantially extend previous constraints on this model. Masses below 2.0 to 2.7 TeV are excluded, depending on the model parameters. In addition, the existence of a W boson with universal fermion couplings is excluded at 95% confidence level, for W masses below 2.7 TeV. For further reinterpretation a model-independent limit on potential signals for various transverse mass thresholds is also presented.",

            "text": "New heavy gauge bosons are predicted by various extensions of the standard model (SM). Charged heavy gauge bosons are generally referred to as W [1]. Non-universal gauge interaction models (NUGIM) [2][3][4][5] predict a larger W -boson branching fraction to the third generation of fermions. Searches for a W boson decaying to a tau lepton and neutrino have never been performed before, while the electron and muon channels have been studied extensively at the Tevatron [6,7] and by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC [8,9]. This Letter describes a search for a W boson decaying to a tau lepton and a neutrino with the CMS detector [10] at the CERN LHC, using proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 . The results are interpreted in the context of the sequential standard model (SSM) W boson [1] as well as an extended gauge group NUGIM [2,11,12]. The signature of a W -boson event is similar to that of a W-boson event in which the W boson is produced \"off shell\" with a high mass. Events of interest are those in which the only detectable products of the W decay form a single hadronically decaying tau (\u03c4 h ). The hadronic decays of the tau lepton are experimentally distinctive because they result in low charged hadron multiplicity, unlike QCD jets, which have high hadron multiplicity, or other leptonic W decays, which have none. In contrast, the decays W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bd e \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 and W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 can-E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. not be distinguished from W \u2192 e\u03bd e and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc , thus they suffer from low significance and are not selected in this analysis but rather in the corresponding leptonic (e, \u03bc) W searches.",

It is a narrow resonance with fermionic decay modes and branching fractions similar to those of the SM W boson, with the addition of the decay W \u2192 tb, which becomes relevant for W -boson masses larger than 180 GeV. If the W boson is heavy enough to decay to top and bottom quarks, the SSM branching fraction for the decay W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd is 8.5%. Under these assumptions, the total width of a 1 TeV W boson is about 33 GeV. Decays of the W boson into WZ bosons depend on the specific model assumptions and are usually considered to be suppressed in the SSM, as assumed by the current search and by previous searches in other final states [9,13]. If the W interacts with left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles (V \u2212 A coupling), interference with the SM W boson is expected [14][15][16].",

The tau decay is simulated by tauola [24] for all samples. For the hadronization of the MadGraph background, pythia is used. The response of these events in the CMS detector is simulated using Geant4 [25]. The backgrounds are produced at leading-order (LO), but reweighted to higher order cross sections. For the main W+jets background, a differential cross section as a function of the mass of the W-boson decay products is reweighted, incorporating next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD and next-to-leading-order (NLO) electroweak corrections. The effect with respect to the LO calculation corresponds to a K-factor of 1.3 at a mass of 0.3 TeV and drops for higher masses to 1.1 for a mass of 1 TeV. The calculation uses Monte Carlo generators mcsanc 1.01 [26] and fewz 3.1 [27], following the recommended combination from Ref. [28]. For the Z+jets background, the inclusive NNLO QCD cross section is calculated using fewz. For tt events, the inclusive NNLO calculation from [29] is used. For the diboson (VV) backgrounds, inclusive NLO QCD cross sections are calculated using mcfm 6.6 [30]. The background contribution from multijet events is estimated from control samples in data. The signal events for the SSM W are generated with pythia with NNLO cross sections from fewz. The NUGIM signals are generated with MadGraph 4.5.1 [17] and hadronized with pythia. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) used are CTEQ6L1 [31] for leading order simulation and CTEQ10 [32] for (N)NLO simulation.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. A particle-flow (PF) event algorithm [34] is used to reconstruct the events, identify the tau candidates and determine the missing E T . The algorithm reconstructs and identifies single particles with an optimized combination of all subdetector information. The events are triggered by the CMS trigger system, which is split into two levels, a first level (L1) composed of custom hardware processors, and a high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm. For this analysis a \"jet plus E miss T \" trigger is used, with thresholds of p T > 80 GeV for the jet and E miss T > 105 GeV, where the latter is seeded at L1 in the calorimeter with E miss T above 40 GeV. Both objects are reconstructed at the HLT level using the PF event reconstruction. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [10].",

            "text": "Tau candidates must be distinguished from quark or gluon jets (QCD jets in the following). The hadronic tau decays, \u03c4 h , are reconstructed using the \"hadron-plus-strips\" (HPS) algorithm, which is based on decay modes proceeding via specific intermediate resonances, with a combined branching fraction of 65%. They include modes with either one or three charged hadrons, and up to two neutral pions. Neutral pions are reconstructed via their decay into pairs of photons detected in the ECAL. The pattern of energy deposition in the ECAL typically occurs in \"strips\", elongated in the \u03c6 direction as a result of interactions in the tracker material and the effect of the axial magnetic field. The \u03c4 h candidate is reconstructed from strips and charged hadrons, which are combined using the mass ranges expected from the intermediate resonances. A more detailed discussion of the HPS algorithm can be found in [35]. The reconstruction of hadronic tau decays has been optimized for tau leptons with large p T where different tracks potentially merge. This occurs because either the track reconstruction seed cannot be resolved or the tracks share so many hits that one track cannot be reconstructed. This leads to reconstructed decay modes with only two charged hadrons (instead of three) being accepted to accommodate the boosted topology. The energy measurement of these high-p T objects is dominated by the calorimeter and therefore has a good p T resolution. The allowed mass range for the intermediate state reconstruction is broadened for high-p T tau leptons, to compensate for the mass resolution. With these adaptations the tau reconstruction efficiency is constant at 60% \u00b1 6% for p T > 80 GeV, as has been checked in simulations up to p T = 3 TeV. Hadronic tau decays identified by the HPS algorithm are required to be within the tracking acceptance, |\u03b7| < 2.3, and the tau p T is required to be larger than 50 GeV to reduce the contamination from QCD jets. Additionally the p T of the leading charged hadron is required to be larger than 20 GeV. Subsequently, \u03c4 h is distinguished from other objects that could mimic a tau candidate, such as QCD jets, electrons, or muons. The discriminator against QCD jets is the most important, since the rate of QCD jets at the LHC is several orders of magnitude larger than the tau production rate. Discrimination is based on isolation criteria: no additional PF charged hadrons or photons with | p T | above 2 GeV are allowed in an isolation cone of R = ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 = 0.3 (where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in radians and \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity) around the \u03c4 h candidate direction. Particle-flow objects are corrected for additional collisions in the same bunch crossing (pileup). Charged hadrons are identified as pileup objects by vertex association. Neutral particle candidates are corrected by using an average p T subtraction from the charged hadrons identified as pileup in a R = 0.6 cone.",

This occurs because the signal shape of a W boson with hadronically decaying tau leptons does not show a Jacobian peak structure, because of the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. The interference effect has therefore not been considered in this analysis.

They contribute a total of 3% to the background.",

            "text": "Most of the systematic uncertainties in this analysis affect the shape of the M T distribution by changing the background and sig-nal predictions. Others influence the overall normalization; these include the uncertainty of 2.6% [36] in the integrated luminosity. Simulated event samples are used to evaluate shape-dependent uncertainties arising from the measurement of individual particles and jets in the events. The kinematic variables of the individual objects are varied and the effect of the changes on the final M T distribution is evaluated. In the following, the shapedependent uncertainties are listed in decreasing order of their importance for the high-M T region. The main uncertainty in the background yield for M T \u2265 1 TeV is due to the momentum measurement of the tau lepton [37], important for estimating the contribution from off-shell SM W-boson decays. Using Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events and tau-mass fits, the uncertainty in the momentum scale is estimated to be 3% of the tau p T . This estimation is confirmed by comparing energy measurements from tau and jet reconstruction algorithms for high-p T taus. This results in a 15% scale uncertainty in the background event yield, primarily from the tail of off-shell SM W bosons, which is correlated with the uncertainty in the signal prediction. There is an 8% uncertainty in the event yield from the theoretical prediction of the background. One contribution to this theory uncertainty comes from the NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak calculations and is evaluated following the prescription described in Ref. [28]; there is an additional contribution from the PDFs, for which the prescriptions of Refs. [38,39] are used. The uncertainty in the event yield from the jet energy calibration is estimated to be 6%. The calibration uncertainty is dependent on the jet \u03b7 and p T , and is determined using dijet and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc + jets events [40]. The knowledge of the reconstruction efficiency for high-p T tau leptons is a source of uncertainty influencing the background and signal normalization. The efficiency is determined by studying Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and tt processes [37]. The resulting uncertainty in the normalization is 6%. There is an uncertainty of 20% in the QCD jet contribution to the background, which is estimated from statistical uncertainties in the control regions and cross checks of the method, and which results in a 4-6% uncertainty in the overall background yield. Other sources of uncertainty are the jet energy resolution (\u03b7 and p T dependent) [40], pileup modeling (5% on the estimated number of additional interactions), and other factors affecting the E miss T determination, such as low-energy deposits not associated with a jet (10% uncertainty in the energy of deposits smaller than 10 GeV). The overall impact of these effects is a 6% background uncertainty. The impact of all these uncertainties on the signal acceptance has been evaluated using the simulated samples. The size and relative importance of the effects observed are similar to those for the background yield, and depend on the shape of the M T distribution.",

The SSM W boson is excluded for masses 0.3 < M W < 2.7 TeV at 95% CL in the tau channel. The lower mass limit is due to the trigger threshold and rising background. The W mass limit obtained at 95% CL is 400 GeV lower for a signal cross section calculated to leading order. In the high mass region, off-shell production of W bosons becomes dominant, shifting the signal M T distribution to lower M T . In comparison, analyses of the muon and electron channels have set limits of 3.0 and 3.2 TeV on the SSM W mass, respectively [9]. In addition to the limit on the SSM W boson, limits are set on the parameter space of the NUGIM. Only leading-order signal cross sections are available in the NUGIM. A separate cross section limit is derived for each value of the model parameter cot \u03b8 E , since the signal efficiency depends on this parameter. The actual width of the W resonance for a given mass, as shown in Fig. 1, is taken into account. From these limits, constraints on the mass of the W boson as a function of the coupling parameter cot \u03b8 E are derived in the same way as described previously for the SSM W boson. The resulting constraints from these mass exclusion limits on the parameter space can be seen in Fig. 4. The W mass limit is 2.0 TeV for cot \u03b8 E = 5.5, rising to a W boson mass of 2.7 TeV for cot \u03b8 E = 1. This variation is due in part to the change in coupling strength to the tau lepton, which affects the decay, as shown in Fig. 1, and in part to the change in coupling to light quarks, which affects the production. For cot \u03b8 E > 5.5 the width of the W becomes very broad, and large virtual corrections are needed. This search sets significantly better limits than the previous constraints from direct and indirect searches for large cot \u03b8 E [9, 11,13] reinterpreted in [12]. For cot \u03b8 E < 1, the light families yield a better sensitivity because of their higher efficiency and branching fraction as shown for the case of the electron channel in Fig. 4.",
