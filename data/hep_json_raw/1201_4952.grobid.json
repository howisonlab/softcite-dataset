Differential cross-sections are presented as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity. The fraction of J/\u03c8 produced in B-hadron decays is also measured and the differential cross-sections of prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 production determined separately. Measurements of the fiducial production crosssection of the \u03a5(1S) and observation of the \u03c7 c,bJ states are also discussed.",

            "text": "Quarkonia are formed from a quark pair of same flavour and should represent one of the simplest systems described by QCD theory. Heavy quarkonium is a multiscale system, allowing for rigorous tests of the interplay between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD and a rich spectrum of radial and orbital excitations allow studies of spectroscopy and decay dynamics [1]. In addition, quarkonia is an ideal probe of cold and hot nuclear matter effects [2]. Many open questions exist in this area, and it has proven difficult thus far to universally describe the kinematics and production properties of quarkonia. ATLAS plans to investigate quarkonium production through measurements of production, spin-alignment and associated hadronic activity of these various states. The first production measurements toward this goal are outlined below.",
