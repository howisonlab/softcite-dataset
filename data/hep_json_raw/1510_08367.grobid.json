            "text": "Rare charm decays may proceed via the highly suppressed c \u2192 u\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 flavour changing neutral current process. In the Standard Model such processes can only occur through loop diagrams, where in charm decays the GIM cancellation [1] is almost complete. As a consequence, the short-distance contribution to the inclusive D \u2192 X\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 branching fraction is predicted to be as low as O(10 \u22129 ) [2], making these decays interesting for searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, taking into account long-distance contributions through tree diagrams involving resonances such as D \u2192 X V (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ), where V represents a \u03c6, \u03c1 0 or \u03c9 vector meson, the total branching fraction of these rare charm decays can reach O(10 \u22126 ) [2][3][4]. Their sensitivity to new physics therefore is greatest in regions of the dimuon mass spectrum away from these resonances, where the main contributions to the branching fraction may come from short-distance amplitudes. Angular asymmetries are sensitive to new physics both in the vicinity of these resonances and away from them [4][5][6][7][8] and could be as large as O(1%).",

When restricted to the dimuon mass range 675 < m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 875 MeV/c 2 , where the \u03c1 0 and \u03c9 resonances are expected to dominate, it can also be used to normalise the decays D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03b7 ( ) (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ). Measuring their branching fractions allows the coupling \u03b7 ( ) \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 to be determined. This contains crucial information for various low energy phenomena, and is an input to the prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [9][10][11]. Focusing on this dimuon mass range also simplifies the analysis, which does not have to account for the variation of the selection efficiency as a function of m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ). From previous measurements the most stringent 90% confidence level upper limits on the decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 are set by the E791 experiment [12]: B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 35.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the full K \u2212 \u03c0 + mass region and B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the region of the K * 0 resonance.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.

The resulting four-particle candidate must have a good quality vertex and its invariant mass must be consistent with the known D 0 mass [24]. The momentum vector of this D 0 candidate must be consistent with having originated from the PV. A preselection follows the trigger selections. Four charged particles are combined to form D 0 candidates. Tracks that do not correspond to actual trajectories of charged particles are suppressed by using a neural network optimisation procedure. To reject the combinatorial background involving tracks from the PV, only high-p and high-p T tracks that are significantly displaced from any PV are used. This background is further reduced by requiring that the four decay products of the D 0 meson form a good quality vertex that is significantly displaced from the PV and that p T (D 0 ) > 3000 MeV/c. These three criteria also reject candidates formed from partially reconstructed charm hadron decays, combined with either random tracks from the PV or with tracks from the decay of another charmed hadron in the same event. This type of background is further reduced by requiring the D 0 momentum vector is within 14 mrad of the vector that joins the PV with the D 0 decay vertex, ensuring that the D 0 candidate originates from the PV. Finally, the invariant mass of the D 0 candidate, which is reconstructed with a resolution of about 7 MeV/c 2 , is required to lie within 65 MeV/c 2 of the known D 0 mass. In",

Candidates from the remaining two categories appear as tails on the lower-mass side of the m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) distribution and must be accounted for to avoid biases in the non-peaking background and in the signal yield measured by the fit. Due to the small number of such candidates in the simulated sample, simulated D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates where no pion decays in flight are altered to reproduce the effect of such decays, and the corresponding m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) distribution is determined. This is achieved by modifying the momentum vectors of either one or two of the pions present in the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state according to the kinematics of \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc decays. The m(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) distributions obtained after this modification are converted into one-dimensional kernel density estimates. The fit model involves 5 yields: the signal yield, N sig , the yield of normalisation decays, N D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the peaking and non-peaking background yields, N pk and N npk , and the yield of background candidates in the D 0",
