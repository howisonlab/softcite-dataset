Already in 2011 a mean occupancy of 20 is often found in pp running. In 2004 studies by ATLAS showed that the detector would have excellent performance also for the foreseeable particle multiplicities in the highest energy p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions that the LHC will produce. These studies resulted in a letter of intent to the LHC committee by ATLAS to do physics with these beams also. In the past 2 years of data taking, ATLAS detector performance studies have confirmed these expectations at the actual multiplicities presented below.",

That year is sometimes identified with a triumph of e + e \u2212 colliders-the \"November Revolution\" [1] as well as the first papers on QCD [2]. Also in the same year a paper by Lee and Wick asked \"whether it is experimentally possible in a limited domain in space to excite the ordinary vacuum to an abnormal state\" [3]. A conference in Bear Mountain, NY, organized by Lee, Lederman, Ruderman et al. [4] explored the experimental possibilities, including using an existing collider (ISR) with nuclear beams. In the same year interest developed in hadron-nucleus collisions as a tool to understand the space-time development of particle production due to the Fermilab experiments of Busza [5] et al. Since the LHC provides access to both the highest energy pp collisions and the highest energy collisions of nuclear beams it is natural to use the largest and most complex particle detectors (e.g. ATLAS) to explore these topics also.",

In contrast, for the Pb-Pb data presented here the initial collision impact parameter (or, by calculation, the number of participant nucleons ) and orientation of the collision are determined with good precision. In the case of pp data, for example, multiplicity is measured for a sample of collisions ranging from peripheral (and, in some cases, diffractive) to very central for which we would expect more or less copious particle production. Similarly the leading baryon effect implies that a large fraction of the collision energy is carried away by a leading baryon (protons or neutrons with roughly equal probability) in each hemisphere. It has been shown that when the effective c.m.s. energy of pp collisions is corrected for the leading particle effect, pp multiplicities exhibit the same trend vs. energy as those from e + e \u2212 or even nucleus-nucleus [9].",

In fact this has been observed early in the SPS Heavy ion program by NA50. There are many aspects of the observed suppression which are not well understood, however. Originally it was felt that this suppression must occur because color screening in Heavy Ion collisions would prevent formation of a quark-antiquark bound state. One way to get further insight into this problem is to search for similar suppression of Z 0 or W \u00b1 bosons since these are neither strongly interacting or composite. Any modification of their yield would have to arise from the initial state (i.e. due to nuclear structure function).",

The anisotropic emission of particles described by the v n moments is modeled as small initial state perturbations which propagate hydrodynamically. It would be interesting to study the v n for a class of events where a \u223c 50 GeV jet is emitted since its energy loss must produce a large perturbation. It would also be of interest to compare jet suppression for b-quark jets.",

CMS has shown that similar features of correlations in Pb-Pb data also appear in pp collisions selected for high multiplicity which likely corresponds to very large gluon densities [15] and studies are under way which reveal other similarities to high multiplicity Pb-Pb collisions [16].
