            "text": "Evaluations from experimental data of fundamental parameters, such as Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements [1], and limits on physics beyond that described by the standard model, often rely on theoretical input [2]. One of the most useful models, the heavy quark expansion (HQE) [3][4][5], is based on the operator product expansion [6]; it is used, for example, to extract values for jV ub j and jV cb j from measurements of inclusive semileptonic B meson decays [7]. In the free quark model, the lifetimes of all b-flavored hadrons are equal, because the decay width is determined by the b quark lifetime. This model is too na\u00efve, since effects of other quarks in the hadron are not taken into account [8]. Early predictions using the HQE, however, supported the idea that b-hadron lifetimes were quite similar, due to the absence of correction terms O\u00f01=m b \u00de. In the case of the ratio of lifetimes of the \u00c3 0 b baryon, \u00c3 0 b , to the \" B 0 meson, \" B 0 , the corrections of order O\u00f01=m 2 b \u00de were found to be small, initial estimates of O\u00f01=m 3 b \u00de [9,10] effects were also small, thus, differences of only a few percent were expected [8,9,11]. Measurements at LEP, however, indicated that \u00c3 0 b = \" B 0 was lower: in 2003 one widely quoted average of all data gave 0:798 AE 0:052 [12], while another gave 0:786 AE 0:034 [13]. Some authors sought to explain the small value of the ratio by including additional operators or other modifications [14], while others thought that the HQE could be pushed to provide a ratio of $0:9 [15]. Recent measurements have shown indications that a higher value is possible [16], although the uncertainties are still large. Therefore, a precision measurement of \u00c3 0 b = \" B 0 is necessary to provide a confirmation of the HQE, or show definitively that the theory is deficient.",
