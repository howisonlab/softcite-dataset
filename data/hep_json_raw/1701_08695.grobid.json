The measurement is based on data collected with the CMS apparatus at the LHC, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.34 \u00b5b \u22121 . The energy is measured in the CASTOR calorimeter, which covers the pseudorapidity region \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2. The results are given as a function of the total energy deposited in CASTOR, as well as of its electromagnetic and hadronic components. The spectra are sensitive to the modeling of multiparton interactions in pp collisions, and provide new constraints for hadronic interaction models used in collider and in high energy cosmic ray physics.",

            "text": "Particle production at very forward rapidities (|\u03b7| > 5) in high energy hadronic collisions receives contributions from multiparton interactions (MPI), initial-and final-state radiation (from the hardest parton scattering), fragmentation of the so-called \"beam remnants\", plus diffraction [1]. The sum of all these particle production mechanisms, typically referred to as the \"underlying event\" [2], is modeled phenomenologically in hadronic Monte Carlo event generators with parameters tuned from the data [3][4][5]. A good understanding of forward particle production is important for a complete description of the final states in proton-proton (pp) interactions at colliders, as well as to accurately simulate extensive air showers induced in the earth atmosphere by very high energy cosmic rays [6]. In particular, forward charged hadron production has direct impact on the total number of air-shower muons at the ground, whose measurement shows unexplained excesses compared to model predictions [7]. The rapidities covered in the presented measurement (\u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2, still well separated from the beam rapidity y \u2248 9.5) are mostly sensitive to the MPI activity [8].",

The present paper reports new measurements of inclusive energy spectra at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are discussed in terms of the production of electrons and photons (mostly from \u03c0 0 decays), as well as hadrons (mostly \u03c0 \u00b1 ) in the very forward direction covered by the CASTOR calorimeter of the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. CASTOR [14] covers the pseudorapidity region \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2, and can distinguish between electromagnetic and hadronic energy depositions. CASTOR is only installed on the negative z-side of CMS, and hence has acceptance at negative pseudorapidities. Because of CASTOR's very forward location, the data are sensitive to parton interactions at very small and large fractional momenta in the proton, x < 10 \u22124 and x \u2192 1.",

The CASTOR calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter composed of layers of fused silica quartz plates and tungsten absorbers, segmented in 16 azimuthal towers, each with 14 longitudinal channels. The two front channels have a combined depth of 20 radiation lengths and form the electromagnetic section of each tower. The remaining 12 channels constitute the hadronic section. The full depth of a tower amounts to 10 hadronic interaction lengths. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and all relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [15].

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.34 \u00b5b \u22121 , with an average pp interaction probability of 5% per bunch crossing. Data were recorded with an unbiased trigger requiring only the presence of two colliding bunches. Electronic noise and beam-induced backgrounds are studied with data taken without colliding bunches. Events are selected offline by requiring hadronic activity in the HF calorimeters on either side of CMS. At least one reconstructed calorimeter tower with energy larger than 5 GeV is required. With these selection criteria the residual contribution of electronic noise and beam background is well below 1%.",

Because of this, an independent method based on 7 TeV collision data is used to determine the absolute energy scale calibration of CASTOR. The average energy measured by the HF calorimeters in the region 3 < |\u03b7| < 5 is fully corrected to the particle level [30] and extrapolated to the region covered by CASTOR, using various hadronic interaction models. The result of the extrapolation is used to calibrate CASTOR. The detector response is found to be consistent with the test beam results.

This threshold is determined independently for every calorimeter tower and varies between 2 and 2.5 GeV. The electromagnetic and hadronic contributions to the total energy can be determined by using the corresponding sections of CASTOR. The measured detector-level spectra are shown in figure 1. Differences among model predictions are apparent. The correction to the particle level is carried out through an unfolding technique by means of the RooUnfold package [31] with the iterative algorithm proposed by D'Agostini [32]. The procedure is stopped after 4 (6,5) iterations for the total (electromagnetic, hadronic) spectrum, when the change with respect to the previous step is less than one percent. Figure 2 shows the distributions of reconstructed energy in CASTOR as a function of the true energy at particle level for pythia 8 CUETP8M1. The fact that the slope of the correlation for the hadronic energy is not unity reflects the noncompensating nature of the calorimeter. The event selection at particle level is based on the Lorentz-invariant fractional momentum loss of the proton, \u03be. All final-state particles are divided into two systems, X and Y , based on their rapidity with respect to the pair of particles with the largest separation in rapidity. All particles on the negative side of this gap are assigned to the system X, while the particles on the positive side are assigned to the system Y [8]. The invariant masses, M X and M Y , of each system are calculated using the four-momenta of the individual particles, and the variable \u03be is defined as the maximum of their squared ratios to the center-of-mass energy:",
