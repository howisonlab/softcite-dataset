Abstract A measurement is presented of inelastic photoand electroproduction of J /\u03c8 mesons in ep scattering at HERA. The data were recorded with the H1 detector in the period from 2004 to 2007. Single and double differential cross sections are determined and the helicity distributions of the J /\u03c8 mesons are analysed. The results are compared to theoretical predictions in the colour singlet model and in the framework of non-relativistic QCD. Calculations in the colour singlet model using a k T factorisation ansatz are able to give a good description of the data, while colour singlet model calculations to next-to-leading order in collinear factorisation underestimate the data.

            "text": "The description of the process of charmonium production in interactions of photons and hadrons is a challenge to theory, since it involves both the production of the heavy quark system and the formation of the bound state. Charmonium production in electron 1 -proton collisions at HERA is dominated by photon-gluon fusion: a photon emitted from the incoming electron interacts with a gluon from the proton to produce a cc pair that evolves into a charmonium state. In the colour singlet model, only those states with the same quantum numbers as the resulting charmonium contribute to the formation of a bound cc state. This is achieved by radiating a hard gluon in a perturbative process. In the factorisation ansatz of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics, also colour octet cc states contribute to the charmonium production cross section via soft gluon radiation.",

In contrast, the calculation of photoproduction cross sections to next-to-leading order (NLO) [8] showed a reasonable description of the photoproduction cross sections. The calculation proved that the corrections with respect to leading order results are very large, increasing towards large transverse momentum of the J /\u03c8 meson. The same calculation, repeated recently with an up-to-date set of theoretical parameters [9], results in a prediction which is about a factor of three below the measured cross sections, indicating that corrections beyond NLO are needed and/or that contributions from colour octet states may be sizable.",

The CTD consists of two large cylindrical central jet drift chambers (CJC) which are interleaved by a z-chamber and arranged concentrically around the beam-line in a magnetic field of 1.16 T. The CTD provides triggering information based on track segments from the CJC [33,34], and on the z-position of the vertex from the 5-layer multi-wire proportional chamber [35] which is situated inside the inner CJC. To provide the best possible spatial track reconstruction, CTD tracks are linked to hits in the vertex detector, the central silicon tracker CST [36,37]. The CST is installed close to the interaction point, surrounding the beam pipe in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.3 and consists of two layers of double sided silicon strip sensors.",

In photoproduction the transverse momentum P T ,\u03c8 is measured in the lab frame, while in electroproduction the transverse momentum P * T ,\u03c8 is calculated in the \u03b3 * p rest frame. To suppress contributions from diffractive production of J /\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons, selected events are required to contain at least five reconstructed tracks in the central region of the detector (20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 160 \u2022 ). The reconstruction efficiency accounts for this experimental cut and the measured cross sections are corrected for this track multiplicity cut. Figure 1 shows the invariant mass spectra of the leptons in the selected event samples. The number of signal events, N J/\u03c8 , is obtained in all bins of the cross section measurements from a fit to the mass distributions in the interval 2 < m < 6 GeV. For the decay into muons the signal peak is described using a modified Gaussian [7]. In the case of a decay into two electrons an exponential is added to the lower mass region of the signal Gaussian in order to account for the radiative tail [44]. For the differential cross section measurements, the width and asymmetry term of the mass peak in each bin are fixed to the values obtained from the full samples.

            "text": "The fraction of events arising from b hadrons decaying into J /\u03c8 + X is estimated using the PYTHIA simulation. The PYTHIA prediction is scaled by a factor of 2, based on results from previous measurements of beauty production at HERA [56,57]. This scaled prediction by PYTHIA amounts to 5% in the total sample and about 20% in the lowest z bin. It is confirmed within uncertainties by the following determination using data. The fraction of events in the photoproduction sample containing b hadrons is estimated using the impact parameter of the decay muons to exploit the lifetime signature of b hadrons. The impact parameter, \u03b4, of the decay muon tracks is defined as the distance of closest approach in the transverse plane to the reconstructed primary vertex. The sign of the impact parameter is defined as positive if the angle between the decay muon and the J /\u03c8 meson momentum direction is less than 90 \u2022 , and is defined as negative otherwise. A signed significance S = \u03b4/\u03c3 (\u03b4) is reconstructed by weighting the reconstructed signed impact parameter with its uncertainty [58]. Figure 4(b) shows the distribution of the signed significance for events in the in-terval 0.3 < z < 0.4. The histogram is filled with the signed significance of the decay muons for all events where both muon tracks have at least one hit in the CST. The fraction of events coming from the decay of b hadrons is obtained from a fit of the significance distribution of CASCADE (simulating prompt J /\u03c8 meson production) plus PYTHIA (simulating bb events with subsequent decays into J /\u03c8 + X) to that of the data. The fit results are dominated by the region of small signed significances, S < 3, due to large statistical uncertainties at larger values of S. The distribution of the data is corrected for non-resonant contributions using the side bands [44]. The relative contribution from b hadrons as resulting from the fits are shown in Fig. 4(c) for three bins of z. The scaled predictions from PYTHIA are found to be in The contribution from \u03c7 c production and decay was studied [3] and found negligibly small in the present kinematic region, 0.3 < z < 0.9.",

The detector simulation is reweighted to match the efficiency measured in the data as necessary. Remaining differences are smaller than 3% everywhere and are taken as systematic uncertainty. \u2022 The systematic uncertainty on the determination of the number of signal events, obtained by a fit to the mass distributions in every analysis bin, is determined by a variation of the extraction method. Comparing the number of signal events for binned and unbinned log-likelihood fits yields a systematic uncertainty of 0.5%. In addition, the result from the fit to background and signal is compared to the number of signal events above the fitted background function in the mass window between 2.95 and 3.2 GeV.  An uncertainty of 2% for the decay into muons and 4% for the electrons is found. The uncertainty for the electron is larger due to an additional uncertainty originating from the description of the radiative tail. \u2022 The trigger efficiencies are determined using independent trigger channels. For the electroproduction sample the trigger efficiency is measured to be (97 \u00b1 2)%. In the photoproduction sample the trigger efficiency depends mainly on the identification of the decay muons in the central muon system. The efficiency amounts to about 70% with a systematic uncertainty of 3%. \u2022 For the electroproduction sample the measurement of the scattered electron energy is known with a scale uncertainty of 1%. The uncertainty of the scattering angle is 1 mrad. Both uncertainties combined lead to an uncertainty of the cross section measurement of 2% on average. \u2022 The hadronic energy scale uncertainty is 4% in the LAr and 7% in the SpaCal.

The model uncertainty arising from the knowledge of the decay angular distributions, explained in Sect. 9, is determined by variation of the parameter \u03b1 in the simulation by \u00b10.3. This variation results in a change of the cross section of up to 4%. The systematic uncertainty originating from the uncertainty of the slope of the P T ,\u03c8 (P * T ,\u03c8 ) distribution in the simulation is determined by a variation of this dis-tribution.

In addition to the CASCADE prediction, the remaining contributions from diffractive \u03c8(2S) mesons and from b hadrons are shown. The distributions in P 2 T ,\u03c8 and z are further investigated by dividing the sample into bins of P 2 T ,\u03c8 and z, respectively as shown in Fig. 6. The z distribution tends to flatten off towards larger values of P T ,\u03c8 presented in Fig. 6(a). It can be seen that differences between the data and the CASCADE prediction are localised at low elasticities and low transverse momenta of the J /\u03c8 mesons, where CASCADE overshoots the data, and at large elasticities and large transverse momenta, where CAS-CADE is below the data. Taking into account that the measured cross section in the lowest elasticity bin includes a significant fraction of about 20% of events originating from b hadron decays, the difference to the CASCADE prediction is even more significant.",

Figure 8 shows differential cross sections as a function of the elasticity z in bins of P * T ,\u03c8 and as a function of P * 2 T ,\u03c8 in bins of z. A comparison of the electroproduction data with predictions from the Monte Carlo generator CASCADE reveals in general a reasonable agreement with the data. Differences in shape can be seen in the differential cross section as a function of P * 2 T ,\u03c8 . For photoproduction, several theory calculations to nextto-leading order have been performed and are compared with the data in Fig. 9. A calculation in the CSM at NLO [8] was repeated using up-to-date sets of scale parameters [9,22], yielding predictions as shown in Fig. 9(a)-(b). The shapes of the data are reasonably described, whereas the normalisation of the prediction is about a factor three below the data, with large uncertainties, indicating that corrections beyond next-to-leading order are necessary in order to describe the data. Estimates of the NNLO contribution for charmonium production at the Tevatron [61,62] indicate that these contributions can be large indeed.",

A comparison of this prediction with the data is shown in Fig. 9(c)-(d). The dominant uncertainty arises from the difference in the predicted cross section when using LO colour octet LDMEs or higher order improved LDMEs [22]. The NRQCD prediction fails however in describing the shape of the differential cross section as a function of the elasticity z, even within the presently large uncertainties of the calculation. In addition to these uncertainties, the reliability of NRQCD calculations is questionable at large values of the elasticity z, due to the presence of both large perturbative corrections and enhanced nonperturbative power corrections [64][65][66].

In the helicity frame the polarisation axis z in the J /\u03c8 meson rest frame is defined by the flight direction of the J /\u03c8 meson in the \u03b3p rest frame, whereas the polarisation in the Collins-Soper frame is measured with respect to the bisector of proton (\u2212 p p ) and photon ( p \u03b3 ) in the J /\u03c8 meson rest frame [67]. Subsequently, the frame-dependent polarisation axis is taken as z axis of a right handed coordinate system, where the x and z axis lie in a plane spanned by the photon and proton directions.

The measurement is compared with predictions calculated in a k T factorisation ansatz [29] and with calculations in CSM (collinear factorisation) at leading [29] and next-to-leading order [9]  Table 10 Measured polarisation parameters in the helicity and the Collins-Soper frame as function of P T ,\u03c8 and z in the kinematic range P T ,\u03c8 > 1 GeV, 60 < W \u03b3p < 240 GeV and 0.3 < z < 0.9 ties. In contrast, the leading order CSM calculation predicts larger values for the polarisation variables than the measured ones for many bins and is disfavoured by the measurement. A similar measurement was published by the ZEUS collaboration in a different kinematic range [68].",

It is found that predictions based on k T factorisation in the colour singlet model are able to describe the cross sections and the helicity distributions well. Calculations based on collinear factorisation in the colour singlet model at next-to-leading order produce a reasonable description of the shape of the measured cross sections, but are lower in normalisation. They give an acceptable description of the polarisation parameter measurements within the large uncertainties. The failure to describe the cross section measurements and the strong sensitivity to scale variations indicate that calculations beyond next-to-leading order are necessary. Moreover contributions from colour octet states may be significant.",
