The data sample was collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The decay width of the top quark is measured using a template fit to distributions of kinematic observables associated with the hadronically and semileptonically decaying top quarks. The result, t = 1.76 \u00b1 0.33 (stat.) +0.79   \u22120.68 (syst.) GeV for a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV, is consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model.",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest particle in the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics, discovered more than 20 years ago in 1995 [1,2]. Due to its large mass of around 173 GeV [3][4][5], the lifetime of the top quark is extremely short. Hence, its decay width is the largest of all SM fermions. A next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculation predicts a decay width of t = 1.33 GeV for a top-quark mass (m t ) of 172.5 GeV [6,7]. Variations of the parameters entering the NLO calculation, the W -boson mass, the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , the Fermi coupling constant G F and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb , within experimental uncertainties [8] yield an uncertainty of 6%. The recent next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) calculation predicts t = 1.322 GeV for m t = 172.5 GeV and \u03b1 S = 0.1181 [9].",

Some BSM models, vector-like quark models for example [15], predict a sizeable deviation from the assumptions used in indirect measurements. This provides a motivation to perform a direct measurement of t . However, such a measurement is not yet sensitive to alternative BSM models with the current precision. A direct measurement of t , based on the analysis of the top-quark invariant mass distribution was performed at the Tevatron by the CDF Collaboration [18]. A bound on the decay width of 1.10 < t < 4.05 GeV for m t = 172.5 GeV was set at 68% confidence level. Direct measurements are limited by the experimental resolution of the top-quark mass spectrum, and so far are significantly less precise than indirect measurements, but avoid modeldependent assumptions.",

Thus, the final state consists of four jets, two of which are b-jets, one charged electron or muon and missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) due to the undetected neutrino.

Single-lepton triggers for electrons and muons under stable beam conditions were used. For each lepton type, two single-lepton triggers with the transverse momentum, p T , thresholds of 24 (24) and 60 (36) GeV for electrons (muons) were used. The two triggers with the lower p T thresholds imposed additional isolation requirements on the lepton to keep the trigger rate low. No isolation requirement was used by the higher p T threshold triggers. The nominal signal tt MC sample was generated assuming a top-quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV using the Powheg-Box (v1) event generator [21][22][23], referred to in the following as Powheg, providing NLO QCD matrix-element (ME) calculations [24]. The h damp parameter that regulates the highp T radiation in Powheg was set to m t . The CT10 parton distribution function (PDF) set [25] was used. The event generator was interfaced with Pythia 6.425 [26] for parton showering (PS), hadronisation and underlying event modelling, using the Perugia 2011C set of tuned parameters [27] and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [28]. To estimate the impact of the parton shower and hadronisation model choice, a Powheg+Pythia6 sample is compared to a sample generated with Powheg interfaced with Herwig 6.520 [29] using Jimmy v4.31 [30] to simulate the underlying event. The latter sample is referred to as Powheg+Herwig in the following. The h damp parameter was set to infinity in both samples used to assess the systematic uncertainty due to parton shower modelling. The uncertainty due to the MC event generator choice is estimated using the alternative MC event generator MC@NLO [31,32] for the hard process, interfaced to Herwig for showering, hadronisation and the simulation of the underlying event which is compared to the Powheg+Herwig sample. To assess the impact of the initialand final-state radiation, samples generated with Powheg were interfaced to Pythia with different settings for the event generator parameters regulating ISR and FSR. In these samples, the h damp parameter and the factorisation and renormalisation scales in Powheg, as well as the transverse momentum scale for space-like parton shower evolution in Pythia were varied to cover the range in additional jet multiplicity corresponding to the uncertainty of tt production measurements in association with jets [33,34]. The tt samples are normalised using the theoretical cross-section of \u03c3 tt = 253 +15 \u221216 pb, based on a calculation performed with the Top++2.0 [35][36][37][38][39][40] program that includes NNLO corrections and resums next-tonext-to-leading-logarithmic-order (NNLL) soft gluon terms. PDF and scale variations, the choice of \u03b1 S , and the input top-quark mass are regarded as sources of systematic uncertainty.",

Parton shower and hadronisation were modelled with Pythia 6.425. Separate samples were generated for W/Z + bb, W/Z + cc, W + c, and W/Z +light jets. A parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [42] is used to prevent double-counting of jets generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton-shower evolution. The W +jets events are normalised using a data-driven method exploiting the asymmetry of W \u00b1 production in pp collision [43]. The corrections for event generator mismodelling in the fractions of different flavour components (W + bb, W + cc, W + c and W +light jets) are estimated in a sample with the same lep-ton and E miss T selections as the signal selection, but with only two jets and no b-tagging requirement. The b-jet multiplicity, in conjunction with knowledge of the b-tagging and mistag efficiency, is used to extract the heavy-flavour fractions. The correction factors extracted from the MC simulation and used in the analysis are K bb = K cc = 1.50 \u00b1 0.11 (stat.+syst.), K c = 1.07 \u00b1 0.27 (stat.+syst.) and K light = 0.80 \u00b1 0.04 (stat.+syst.)

The jet reconstruction starts from calibrated topological clusters [62] which are built from energy deposits in the calorimeters. To correct for effects due to the non-compensating calorimeter response, dead material and out-of-cluster leakage, a local cluster calibration scheme [63,64] is applied prior to jet finding. Simulations of charged and neutral particles are exploited to estimate these corrections. The jets are calibrated by applying energy-and |\u03b7|-dependent calibration factors, derived from simulations, to the mean energy of the jets built from the stable particles [65]. In addition, a residual calibration [66] of the jet energy scale (JES) was performed using data taken in 2012. Dijet events are used to calibrate jets in the forward region against jets in the central region. Photon+jet as well as Z +jet events are used to calibrate central jets, and multijet events are used to calibrate highp T jets. These measurements are then combined. Jets are accepted if they fulfil p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 after energy calibration. To reduce the contribution from jets associated with pile-up, jets having p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 must satisfy a requirement [67] for the jet vertex fraction, 3 JVF > 0.5. To prevent double-counting of electrons as jets, the closest jet lying R < 0.2 of a selected electron is discarded. If the nearest jet surviving the selection described above is within R = 0.4 of the electron, the electron is discarded.",

As this background becomes very small in high b-tag multiplicity regions, these requirements are not applied to events with at least two b-tagged jets.

The logarithm of the likelihood has to satisfy ln(L) > \u221250 to suppress the combinatorial background due to wrongly reconstructed events and to decrease other backgrounds. This improves the sensitivity of the measurement by increasing the fraction of wellreconstructed tt events in the selected sample. Events satisfying all selection criteria are separated into eight mutually exclusive analysis regions. The events are categorised according to the flavour of the selected lepton and whether they have exactly one or at least two b-tagged jets. They are further split into two |\u03b7| regions, a central region with all four jets associated with the tt decay having |\u03b7| \u2264 1 and a second one with at least one jet with |\u03b7| > 1. This approach takes advantage of the different sensitivity of these regions to detector resolution effects and pile-up contributions and different amounts of background. The corresponding event yields are listed in Table 1. Figures 1, 2 show the distributions of the lepton and leading b-tagged jet p T , lepton and leading b-tagged jet \u03b7, E miss T and m W T for events with at least two b-tagged jets in the electron and muon channels, respectively.

However, both background events and tt events with partially correctly and incorrectly matched jets contribute to the full range of likelihood values. The double peak structure of the output is thus not related to a correct match of jets but caused by the migration of the events which are not matched correctly towards the higher values of the likelihood due to the fixed top quark mass requirement. The fraction of events where all four partons are matched correctly increases from 13 to 23% ( 17 to 31%) after applying this requirement to events with at least one (two) b-tagged jet(s). This selection also improves the purity of the sample by removing more background events than tt signal. The analysis does not rely on matching correctly all four jets. The observable m b , which provides most of the sensitivity to t , depends solely on the correct assignment of the b-jet from the semileptonically decaying top quark for which the reconstruction efficiency is 65% (75%) for events with at least one (two) b-tagged jet(s).",

The observables are m b , which is the reconstructed invariant mass of the b-jet of the semileptonically decaying top quark and the corresponding lepton, and R min ( j b , j l ), which is the angular distance between the b-jet j b and the closest light jet j l , both originating from the hadronically decaying top quark. The choice of m b is due to its good sensitivity to t while being less sensitive to jet-related uncertainties compared to reconstructed masses of the hadronic decay branch. Despite the much lower sensitivity of R min ( j b , j l ) to t , it is beneficial to use it in the fit because it adds information from the hadronic top-quark decay branch and reduces leading jet-related and signal model systematic uncertainties in the combination with m b . Several other observables defined using the invariant mass of, or angles between, the tt decay products were tested but were found to be less suitable because of larger jet-related or signal model uncertainties. Signal templates are generated by reweighting events at parton-level to Breit-Wigner distributions with alternative top-quark decay-width hypotheses. A total of 54 templates for different values of t are created: 50 templates cover the range 0.1 < t < 5.0 GeV in steps of = 0.1 GeV. Four additional templates are created for t = 0.01, 6, 7, 8 GeV to take into account very small and very large width values. The top-quark decay width in the nominal MC signal sample is t = 1.33 GeV corresponding to the NLO calculation. The reweighting method was validated using a signal MC sample generated with t = 3.0 GeV by comparing top-quark mass distributions of this sample with top-quark mass distributions obtained from the reweighting procedure at parton level, and no significant differences were observed. The impact on the template distributions by varying the decay width in the range of 0.7-3.0 GeV is shown in Fig. 4.",

The measured top-quark decay width is extracted from the minimum of a quadratic fit to the negative logarithm of the likelihood values. The fit method was validated using pseudo-experiments, and the correlation between the two observables was examined. In each pseudo-experiment the content of the bins of the m b and R min ( j b , j l ) distributions are varied according to the Poisson and Gaussian distributions to take into account the expected number of events per bin and the background constraints, respectively. These pseudo-experiments are used for a linearity test and to pro-duce pull distributions. The pull is defined as the difference between the fitted value t and the input value divided by the estimated uncertainty of the fit result. No deviations from the expectation were found for various decay width values within 1.1 < t < 4.0 GeV. For smaller decay width values the pull width decreases since the t distribution approaches a limit of 0 GeV. However, this does not affect the result and the fit method is stable and unbiased.

            "text": "Following the PDF4LHC [77] recommendations, three different PDF sets are compared using a reweighting technique for the signal tt MC sample to estimate the uncertainty due to the PDF set choice: CT10 NLO (nominal PDF set) [25], MSTW 2008 68% CL NLO [52] and NNPDF 2.3 NLO [78]. Each PDF set has a different prescription for using its error sets to evaluate the uncertainty: the CT10 set uses a symmetric Hessian matrix, the MSTW set uses an asymmetric Hessian matrix and the NNPDF set uses a standard deviation for the uncertainty calculation. For the three PDF sets, the variations for all different PDF parameters are evaluated within the corresponding set. Half of the width of the largest deviation from nominal among all three sets is taken as the PDF uncertainty. The tt MC simulation utilised to extract the decay width uses NLO matrix elements for top-quark pair production and LO matrix elements with approximate implementation of finitewidth and interference effects for the decay of the top quarks. A theoretical study [79] performed in the e\u03bc decay channel of the tt system indicates that taking into account offshell effects, which include the contributions from tt and W t single-top production as well as their interference, is important for the precision measurements of top-quark properties. However, there is no MC implementation yet of NLO decay and off-shell effects for the lepton+jets final state. The potential impact of ignoring these effects was tested in two different ways. First, the parton-level m b distribution of a sum of tt and W t single-top contributions without these effects taken into account was reweighted to the m b distribution provided by the authors of Ref. [79] which corresponds to the W W bb calculation at NLO. Second, the measurement was repeated requiring m b < 150 GeV, limiting the analysis to the region where these effects are expected to be suppressed according to Ref. [79]. Both cross-checks yield a difference in the measured top-quark decay width of less than 0.5 GeV. For more precise future measurements, it would be beneficial to have an MC simulation providing an NLO description of the top-quark decay accounting for off-shell effects.",

The decay width of the top quark is extracted using a binned likelihood template fit to data based on two observables related to the hadronic and the semileptonic decay branches of the tt pair. The top-quark decay width is measured to be t = 1.76 \u00b1 0.33 (stat.) +0.79 \u22120.68 (syst.) GeV for m t = 172.5 GeV, which is in a good agreement with SM predictions.
