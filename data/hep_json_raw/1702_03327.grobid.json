Such particles, referred to as \"dark photons\", are motivated by theories applying a U (1) gauge symmetry to dark matter. We find no evidence for such processes and set 90% confidence level upper limits on the coupling strength of A to e + e \u2212 in the mass range m A \u2264 8 GeV. In particular, our limits exclude the values of the A coupling suggested by the dark-photon interpretation of the muon (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 anomaly, as well as a broad range of parameters for the dark-sector models. The nature of dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics. It is transparent to electromagnetic radiation and we have only been able to infer its existence through gravitational effects. Since terrestrial searches for dark matter interactions have so far yielded null results, it is postulated to interact very weakly with ordinary matter. Recently, models attempting to explain certain astrophysical observations [1][2][3][4] as well as the muon (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 anomaly [5] have introduced an appealing idea of a low-mass spin-1 particle, referred to as A or U , that would possess a gauge coupling of electroweak strength to dark matter, but with a much smaller coupling to the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge [6,7]. Such a boson may be associated with a U (1) gauge symmetry in the dark sector and kinetically mix with the SM photon with a mixing strength \u03b5 1; hence the name \"dark photon\". Values as high as \u03b5 \u223c 10 \u22123 and masses in a GeV range have been predicted in the literature [6,7].",

The backgrounds in this region are dominated by the QED process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, especially near M X \u2248 0 (E * \u03b3 \u2248 \u221a s/2). Due to the orientation of the EMC crystals, which point towards the IR, one of the photons may escape detection even if it is within the nominal EMC acceptance. The event selection is optimized to reduce this peaking background as much as possible. The \"HighM\" trigger selection defines the high M X range 24 < M 2 X < 69 (63.5) GeV 2 for the \u03a5 (3S) (\u03a5 (2S)) dataset. This region is dominated by the lowangle radiative Bhabha events e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3, in which both the electron and the positron escape the detector.",

First, after a relatively coarse selection, we include the EMC variables that describe the shape of the electromagnetic shower: the difference between the number of crystals in the EMC cluster and the expectation for a single photon of given energy, and two transverse shower moments [25]. Second, we include both the total excess EMC energy in the laboratory frame not associated with the highest-energy photon, and the CM energy and polar angle of the second most energetic EMC cluster. We also compute the azimuthal angle difference \u2206\u03c6 12 between the highest and second-highest energy EMC clusters; the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events with partial energy deposit in the EMC tend to peak at \u2206\u03c6 12 \u223c \u03c0. Third, a number of variables improve containment of the background events. We extrapolate the missing momentum vector to the EMC face, and compute the distance (in (\u03b8, \u03c6) polar lab-frame coordinates) to the nearest crystal edge. This allows us to suppress e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events where one of the photons penetrates the EMC between crystals leaving little detectable energy. Furthermore, we look for energy deposited in the IFR, and compute the correlation angle \u2206\u03c6 N H between the primary photon and the IFR cluster closest to the missing momentum direction; e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events produce a peak at cos \u2206\u03c6 N H \u223c \u22121. We also apply a fiducial selection to the azimuthal angle \u03c6 miss of the missing momentum by including cos(6\u03c6 miss ) into the BDT. This accounts for uninstrumented regions between six IFR sectors [22]. Finally, cos \u03b8 * \u03b3 is included in the BDT to take advantage of the different angular distributions for signal and background events.",
