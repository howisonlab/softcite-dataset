The search is performed in event samples enhanced in vector-boson fusion Higgs boson production by requiring two jets with large invariant mass in addition to the Higgs boson candidate decay products. The analysis is based on the full dataset of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb \u22121 . The data are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions and an upper limit at the 95% confidence level is placed on the production cross section times the branching ratio for the decay H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg. This limit ranges from 3.1 pb to 9.0 pb depending on the mass of the a boson.",

            "text": "The discovery or exclusion of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson was one of the main goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics programme. A Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV, and with properties compatible with those expected for the SM Higgs boson (H ), was discovered by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations. Since its discovery, a comprehensive programme of measurements of the properties of this particle has been underway. These measurements could uncover deviations from branching ratios predicted by the SM or set a limit on the possible branching ratio for decays into new particles beyond the SM (BSM). Existing measurements constrain the branching ratio for such decays (B BSM ) to less than 34% at 95% confidence level (CL) [3], assuming that the absolute couplings to vector bosons are smaller than or equal to the SM ones. The results presented in this Letter cover the unexplored \u03b3 \u03b3 jj final state in searches for H \u2192 aa, where one of the a bosons decays into a pair of photons and the other decays into a pair E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch. of gluons. This final state becomes relevant in models where the fermionic decays are suppressed and the a boson decays only into photons or gluons [4,10]. The ATLAS Run 1 search for H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 [11] set a 95% CL limit \u03c3 H \u00d7 B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 ) < 10 \u22123 \u03c3 SM for 10 < m a < 62 GeV, where \u03c3 SM is the production cross-section for the SM Higgs boson. There is currently no direct limit set on B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg); however, in combination with B BSM < 34%, the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 result sets an indirect limit on B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg) to less than \u223c 4%. Assuming the same ratio of photon and gluon couplings to the a boson as to the SM Higgs boson, the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay occurs very rarely relative to the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg decay (a typical value for the ratio B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 )/B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg) is 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [10]) making H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 jj an excellent unexplored final state for probing these fermion-suppressed coupling models. The branching ratio for a \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 can be enhanced in some scenarios. The two searches are therefore complementary, where the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 jj final state is more sensitive to photon couplings with the new physics sector similar to the photon coupling to the SM Higgs boson, while the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 final state is more sensitive to scenarios with enhanced photon couplings. In addition, the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 jj final state can probe models inaccessible by the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 final state, for example H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 jj where decays leptonically, would require approximately 300 fb \u22121 of LHC data in order to be sensitive to branching ratios less than 4%. The gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) production mode has a larger crosssection, but is overwhelmed by the \u03b3 \u03b3 +multi-jet background. The strategy described in this Letter consists in selecting events where vector-boson fusion (VBF) is the dominant Higgs boson production mode. Even though the production rate is lower than that for the ggF mode, the characteristic topology of the jets produced in association with the Higgs boson enables more effective suppression of the background.",

The ATLAS detector [12] comprises an inner detector in a 2 T axial magnetic field, for tracking charged particles and a precise localisation of the interaction vertex, a finely segmented calorimeter, a muon spectrometer and a two-level trigger [13] that accepts events at a rate of about 1 kHz for data storage. Monte Carlo (MC) event generators were used to simulate the H \u2192 aa \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 gg signal. Signal samples for the ggF and VBF processes were generated at next-to-leading order using Powheg-Box [14][15][16] interfaced with Pythia [17] for parton showering and hadronisation using the AZNLO set of tuned parameters set [18] and the CT10 parton distribution function (PDF) set [19]. Samples were generated in the m a range 1 20 GeV < m a < 60 GeV, assuming the a boson to be a (pseudo)scalar. All MC event samples were processed through a detailed simulation [20] of the ATLAS detector based on geant4 [21], and contributions from additional pp interactions (pile-up), simulated using Pythia and the MSTW2008LO PDF set [22], were overlaid onto the hard-scatter events.",

In the high-level trigger the shape of the energy deposit in both clusters is required to be loosely consistent with that expected from an EM shower initiated by a photon.

As in the trigger selection, photon candidates are required to satisfy a set of identification criteria based on the shape 1 The diphoton triggers considered for this search do not have acceptance for the lower mass range (m a < 20 GeV), where the two photons are collimated. of the EM cluster [24]. Two working points are defined: a Loose working point, used for the preselection and the data-driven background estimation, and a Tight working point, with requirements that further reduce the misidentification of neutral hadrons decaying to two photons. In order to reject the hadronic jet background, photon candidates are required to be isolated from any other activity in the calorimeter. The calorimeter isolation is defined as the sum of the transverse energy in the calorimeter within a cone of R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 centred around the photon candidate, The transverse energy of the photon candidate is subtracted from the calorimeter isolation. Contributions to the calorimeter isolation from the underlying event and pile-up are subtracted using the method proposed in Ref. [25]. Candidates with a calorimeter isolation larger than 2.2% of the photon's transverse energy are rejected. Jets are reconstructed from topological clusters [26] using the anti-k t algorithm [27] implemented in the FastJet package [28] with a radius parameter of R = 0. Each event is required to have at least two photon candidates whose transverse energy requirements depend on the trigger path the event follows. In each path the offline transverse energy requirements are designed so that the trigger selections are fully efficient. For events passing the trigger with higher transverse energy thresholds, the leading photon is required to have E T > 40 GeV, and the sub-leading photon is required to have E T > 30 GeV. For events passing the trigger with lower thresholds, both the leading and sub-leading photons are required to have E T > 27 GeV. For events passing both triggers, the latter selection is applied. The invariant mass of the two leading photon candidates is denoted by m \u03b3 \u03b3 .",

In VBF signal events, these jets correspond to the light quarks emitting the vector bosons 55% of the time, as estimated in simulation. The VBF Higgs boson signal is further enhanced, relative to the dominant \u03b3 \u03b3 +multi-jet background, by requiring m VBF jj to be greater than 500 GeV and the p T of the leading VBF jet to be greater than 60 GeV. The discrimination power of these observables can be seen in the difference in shape between the VBF signal and the data, shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The two remaining highest-p T jets are referred to as signal jets, with invariant mass m jj . The two photon candidates and the two signal jets form the Higgs boson candidate with invariant mass m \u03b3 \u03b3 jj , which is required to be in the range 100 < m \u03b3 \u03b3 jj < 150 GeV.

Dominant sources of experimental systematic uncertainty arise from the calibration and resolution of the energy of the jets [32,33].

Uncertainties associated with the estimation of the integrated luminosity and the simulation of pile-up interactions (Lumi and Pile-up) are found to be negligible.
