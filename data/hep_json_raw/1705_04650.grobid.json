The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions collected in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No excess event yield is observed above the predicted standard model background, and the results are interpreted as exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the masses of predicted particles in a variety of simplified models of R-parity conserving supersymmetry. Depending on the details of the model, 95% confidence level lower limits on the gluino (light-flavor squark) masses are placed up to 2025 (1550) GeV. Mass limits as high as 1070 (1175) GeV are set on the masses of top (bottom) squarks. Information is provided to enable re-interpretation of these results, including model-independent limits on the number of non-standard model events for a set of simplified, inclusive search regions.",

Such searches were previously conducted by both the ATLAS [1-5] and CMS [6-9] Collaborations. Our search builds on the work presented in Ref. [6], using improved methods to estimate the background from standard model (SM) processes and a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected during 2016 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Event counts in bins of the number of jets (N j ), the number of b-tagged jets (N b ), the scalar sum of the transverse momenta p T of all selected jets (H T ), and the M T2 variable [6,10] are compared against estimates of the background from SM processes derived from dedicated data e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch control samples. We observe no evidence for a significant excess above the expected background event yield and interpret the results as exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the production of pairs of gluinos and squarks using simplified models of supersymmetry (SUSY) [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. Modelindependent limits on the number of non-SM events are also provided for a simpler set of inclusive search regions.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector and trigger system, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Refs. [19,20].",

Physics objects reconstructed with this algorithm are hereafter referred to as particle-flow candidates. The physics objects and the event preselection are similar to those described in Ref. [6], and are summarized in Table 1. We select events with at least one jet, and veto events with an isolated lepton (e or \u03bc) or charged PF candidate. The isolated charged PF candidate selection is designed to provide additional rejection against events with electrons and muons, as well as to reject hadronic tau decays. Jets are formed by clustering PF candidates using the anti-k T algorithm [22,23] and are corrected for contributions from event pileup [24] and the effects of non-uniform detector response. Only jets passing the selection criteria in Table 1 are used for counting and the determination of kinematic variables. Jets consistent with originating from a heavy-flavor hadron are identified using the combined secondary vertex tagging algorithm [25], with a working point chosen such that the efficiency to identify a b quark jet is in the range 50-65% for jet p T between 20 and 400 GeV. The misidentification rate is approximately 1% for light-flavor and gluon jets and 10% for charm jets. A more detailed discussion of the algorithm performance is given in Ref. [25].",

Collision events are selected using triggers with requirements on H T , p miss T , H miss T , and jet p T . The combined trigger efficiency, as measured in a data sample of events with an isolated electron, is found to be > 98% across the full kinematic range of the search.

The main background samples (Z+jets, W+jets, and tt+jets), as well as signal samples of gluino and squark pair production, are generated at leading order (LO) precision with the MadGraph 5 generator [30,31] interfaced with pythia 8.2 [32] for fragmentation and parton showering. Up to four, three, or two additional partons are considered in the matrix element calculations for the generation of the V+jets (V = Z, W), tt+jets, and signal samples, respectively. Other background processes are also considered: ttV(V = Z, W) samples are generated at LO precision with the MadGraph 5 generator, with up to two additional partons in the matrix element calculations, while single top samples are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) precision with the Mad-Graph_aMC@NLO [30] or powheg [33,34] generators. Contributions from rarer processes such as diboson, triboson, and four top production, are found to be negligible. Standard model samples are simulated with a detailed Geant4 [35] based detector simulation and processed using the same chain of reconstruction programs as collision data, while the CMS fast simulation program [36] is used for the signal samples. The most precise available cross section calculations are used to normalize the simulated samples, corresponding most often to NLO or next-to-NLO accuracy [30,33,34,[37][38][39][40].",
