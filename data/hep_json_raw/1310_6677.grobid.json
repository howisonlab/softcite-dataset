The first definitive measurement of neutrino oscillations was made by Super-K in 1998 in atmospheric neutrinos [1]. Since that time, the experiment has accumulated significantly more data, more than 11 liveyears, and introduced a wide variety of neutrino event topologies into the oscillation analysis. In these proceedings we use these samples to address the significant issues in neutrino physics today: the detailed nature of oscillations among all three active neutrino flavors as well as the possibility of additional sterile neutrino states.",

The cosmic rays arrive from all directions so the neutrinos produced are incident on our detector from all directions as well.

Downward-going neutrinos, which have a zenith angle near 1, can travel as little as 10 km while upwardgoing neutrinos with cos \u03b8 z near \u22121 can travel as far as 13, 000 km.

It is arranged into two optically-separated regions: an inner-detector instrumented with 11,146 20-inch PMTs and an active-veto outer-detector instrumented with 1,885 8-inch PMTs, both filled with ultra-pure water. A fiducial volume is defined 200 cm inwards from the walls of the inner detector with a mass of 22.5 kton. Super-K has had four run-periods. The SK-I, SK-III, and SK-IV had full 40% photo-coverage while SK-II had only 19% coverage due to an accident in 2001. The most recent period, SK-IV began with the installation of new front-end electronics. allowing trigger-less data acquisition into a buffer on which advanced software-based triggers are applied. Neutrinos, of course, cannot be observed directly since they interact only via the weak nuclear force. Instead, we observe the charged particles produced when the neutrino interacts with a nucleus in the detector. The charged particles produced in these interactions are typically highly relativistic and will produce Cherenkov radiation when their kinetic energy is above a mass-dependent threshold energy (in water, 780 keV for electrons and 160 MeV for muons). Highly-relativistic particles will radiate Cherenkov photons in a cone (42 \u2022 in water for particles with velocity close to c) as long as the particle is above threshold, producing a ring of light projected onto the wall of the detector. The timing of the photon hits allows the vertex to be reconstructed, and direction of travel of the particle can be estimated from the vertex and the center of the ring. The more energetic the particle, the more light it will produce in the detector before falling below threshold. Particle-ID can also be determined based on the shape of the ring. Showering particles (electrons, photons) will produce many overlapping rings which appear as a single ring with a fuzzy edge. Non-showering particles (muons, pions, protons) travel in a consistent direction and produce a ring with a sharp outer boundary. A likelihood-based selection shown in Fig. 1 is used to separate these two ring types.",

The distance is estimated by extrapolating the direction of travel of the observed charged particles in the detector and extrapolating back to the atmosphere (above the detector or across the Earth). The energy is estimated by summing the energy seen in the detector and correcting for differences between showering and non-showering particles.  There are three basic event topologies used in the atmospheric neutrino analysis which cover different neutrino energies (plotted in Fig. 2). Fully-contained (FC) events have vertices inside the fiducial volume and stop before leaving the inner detector. They are the lowest-energy sample ranging from a few hundred MeV up to a few GeV. These events have the best energy resolution since all of the energy is contained and also have good PID information. Conversely, they also have the worst direction resolution since the outgoing lepton direction is less correlated with the incoming neutrino direction. In the oscillation analysis, these events are divided into 13 sub-samples. They are divided up by energy into sub-GeV and multi-GeV samples and binned either in lepton momentum (sub-GeV only) or both energy and cos \u03b8 z (sub-and multi-GeV). The samples are also divided up by number of decay electrons which can signify the presence of a charged pion produced below Cherenkov threshold and particle-id. Sub-GeV samples are split into \u00b5-like, elike, and \u03c0 0 -like (a neutral current-enhanced sample) while Multi-GeV samples are split into \u00b5-like, \u03bd e -like and \u03bd e -like.",

They are split into lower-energy stopping (stops in the inner detector) and higher-energy through-going (exits out the far side of the detector) sub-samples. The through-going events are further sub-divided into nonshowering and showering. The critical energy at which energy loss by bremsstrahlung (the dominant process in showering) equals energy loss by ionization for muons is 900 MeV [9] so evidence of showering provides  an additional handle for estimating the energy of these muons which deposit a potentially large fraction of their energy in the rock around the detector. The showering up-\u00b5 sample is the highest-energy sample in Super-K.

The flux uncertainties are calculated by the groups who calculate the flux prediction [10] and they are based on our knowledge of the cosmic ray flux to the Earth, our knowledge of the atmosphere, and our knowledge of the hadronic interactions that produce the mesons which decay into neutrinos. All three of these pieces are informed by external measurements, with the last being constrained by measurements in hadron production experiments (e.g. [11]). In general, the largest uncertainties are in the absolute normalization of the flux. The ratios of various components to each other are known to much better precision -for example electron/muon ratio, up-going/down-going ratio, etc. The neutrino cross-section uncertainties are based on external cross-section measurements. The detector uncertainties generally relate to energy scale and selection efficiency and vary between run periods (SKI-IV). These uncertainties are determined with laser and radioactive calibration sources and the naturally abundant cosmic-ray muon sample [12,13,14].",

These oscillations are typically parameterized with the PMNS mixing matrix which relates the neutrino mass and flavor eigenstates,  ? In order to focus on these questions, the Super-K zenith angle oscillation fit, which includes all oscillation parameters and matter effects following the prescription from [19] and described in detail in [13], now includes a constraint on sin 2 2\u03b8 13 from [9]. The oscillation probability in Super-K is best shown in the twodimensional plane of cos \u03b8 z vs. energy (Fig. 4). The distortions in the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 oscillation bands and the enhancement of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e around 10 GeV at cos \u03b8 z < \u22120.5 are driven by resonant matter effects as the neutrinos travel through the denser core of the Earth (the PREM model [20] of the Earth density is used). In the normal hierarchy this resonant enhancement happens for neutrinos and in the inverted hierarchy it happens for antineutrinos, so the \u03bd e and \u03bd e enhanced samples described earlier enhance our sensitivity to the mass hierarchy. The \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation enhancements at low energy, driven by the smaller solar \u2206m 2 21 , are sensitive to sin 2 \u03b8 23 and hence the \u03b8 23 octant (while \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 oscillations are primarily sensitive to sin 2 2\u03b8 23 and have little octant sensitivity). The results of the oscillation fit to SKI-IV data are shown in Fig. 5 as contours in \u2206m 2 32 vs. sin 2 \u03b8 32 separately for the normal (\u2206m 2 32 > 0) and inverted (\u2206m 2 32 < 0) mass hierarchy assumptions. Both fits weakly prefer the second octant, though more so with the inverted hierarchy assumption. Also shown is the \u03c7 2 distribution of both the normal and inverted hierarchy assumptions vs. the CP-violating \u03b4 parameter. The inverted hierarchy is preferred to the normal hierarchy by 1.2\u03c3 -no definitive preference yet.",

Having three light neutrinos implies there can be only two independent mass-splittings. Two have been definitively observed in a range of experiments, the solar \u2206m 2 21 and the atmospheric \u2206m 2 32 .

Unitarity reduces these 14 parameters to 5 independent ones: 3 new 'angles' and 2 new phases. The angles can be parameterized multiple ways, but in these proceedings we have chosen to use the magnitudes of the matrix elements: |U e4 | 2 , |U \u00b54 | 2 , and |U \u03c44 | 2 . This type of model, with a fourth sterile neutrino widely separated in mass from the three active neutrinos, is often called '3+1.' Additional neutrinos can be added to make '3+2' or '1+3+1' models, adding 8 additional free parameters to the oscillation model. Hints of possible sterile neutrinos have appeared in several experiments [23]. First the LSND experiment and then the MiniBooNE experiment saw hints of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations consistent with two-flavor oscillations with a \u2206m 2 new \u2248 1 eV 2 [24,25]. The effective two-flavor angle can be translated into the 3+1 parameterization above as sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e = |U e4 | 2 |U \u00b54 | 2 . Some hints of sterile oscillations have also been seen in lower-than-expected rates in short-baseline reactor experiments and in the radioactive source calibra-tions of gallium solar neutrino experiments [26]. If these low rates are interpreted as two-flavor oscillations, they are consistent with \u2206m 2 new > 1 eV 2 and with |U e4 | 2 \u2248 0.02 [26]. The two-flavor angle in this case is, sin 2 2\u03b8 ee = |U",

Muon neutrino disappearance measurements at both short and long baselines are sensitive to oscillations via |U \u00b54 | 2 , driven by \u2206m 2 new . At short baseline this can approximate two-neutrino mixing (the formula is analogous to sin 2 2\u03b8 ee ), but at long baselines like in Super-K, the signature of nonzero |U \u00b54 | 2 is fast oscillations away from normal three-flavor oscillations. Long-baseline measurements like Super-K are also sensitive to sterile oscillations driven by \u2206m 2 32 , but \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd s instead of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 . These oscillations require non-zero |U \u00b54 | 2 and |U \u03c44 | 2 and also introduce a new kind of matter effect. Where the more well known charged current (CC) matter effects arise from the potential difference between \u03bd e 's with CC and neutral current (NC) interactions and \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 with only NC interactions, these new NC matter effects arise from the potential difference between \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , and \u03bd \u03c4 which have NC interactions and \u03bd s which has no weak interactions. These matter effects tend to shift around the effective \u2206m 2 32 in \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance and distort the shape of the oscillations at the longest lengths through the Earth.",

One of the significant advantages of the fit to atmospheric neutrinos is that 3+1 and 3+N models look the same to first order, so a simpler fit can constrain more complex models. We also assume there are no sterile-\u03bd e oscillations (|U e4 | 2 \u2192 0), which is reasonable since the constraints from the \u03bd e disappearance analyses limit the possible size of such an effect to the point where it becomes impossible to observe in Super-K [27].

A second fit is performed for |U \u00b54 | 2 and |U \u03c44 | 2 which includes only the NC matter effects.
