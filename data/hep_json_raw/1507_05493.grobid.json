In all models of GGM, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the gravitinoG (the partner of the hypothetical quantum of the gravitational field), with a mass significantly less than 1 GeV. In the GGM models considered here, the decay of the supersymmetric states produced in LHC collisions would proceed through the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), which would then decay to theG LSP and one or more SM particles, with a high probability of decay into \u03b3 \u00feG. In this study, several different possibilities for the nature of the NLSP are considered, providing separate motivation for the four different and complementary experimental signatures that are explored. In all models considered, all supersymmetric states with the exception of theG are short lived, leading to prompt production of SM particles that are observed in the ATLAS detector.",

In this study, three cases are assumed for the composition of the NLSP. For the first case, the NLSP is assumed to be purely binolike [the SUSY partner of the SM U(1) gauge boson]. For the second case, the NLSP is assumed to be an admixture of bino and neutral higgsino states. For the final case, the NLSP is assumed to be a degenerate triplet of wino states [the SUSY partners of the SM SU (2) gauge bosons]. In this paper, the neutral NLSP is denoted\u03c7 0 1 irrespective of its composition. For the case that the NLSP is a degenerate triplet, the charged NLSP states are denoted\u03c7 AE 1 .

For the case that the NLSP is a mixture of the bino and higgsino, both the possibilities that the higgsino mass parameter \u03bc is less than or greater than zero are explored. For the \u03bc < 0 possibility, the final decay in the cascade would include a significant contribution from\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 h \u00feG with the subsequent decay h \u2192 bb, leading to final states with a photon, multiple b-jets, and E miss T . The latter (\u03bc > 0) possibility can produce scenarios for which the final decay in the cascade can be relatively evenly split between\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3 \u00feG and\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z \u00feG, leading to final states with a photon, multiple jets (including two from the hadronic decay of the Z boson) that most often do not arise from b-quarks, and E miss T . For the case that the NLSP is a degenerate set of three wino states, the final step in the cascade includes charged as well as neutral wino decays. Charged wino decays tend to produce isolated leptons, while neutral wino decays produce photons with a wino-tophoton branching fraction that is no less than sin 2 \u03b8 W for any value of the wino mass. Overall, these two wino-NLSP contributions lead to a significant number of events with an isolated photon accompanied by an isolated lepton. Of the five GGM models considered here, two (the \"gluino-bino\" and \"wino-bino\" models, where the gluino is the SUSY partner of the gluon) incorporate a purely binolike NLSP, two (the \"higgsino-bino\" models) incorporate a NLSP that is a higgsino-bino admixture, and one (the \"wino-NLSP\" model) incorporates a winolike set of NLSPs; in all cases the mass of the NLSP state is considered to be a free parameter of the model. The two GGM models incorporating a binolike NLSP are the focus of the diphoton analysis. For these models, one other set of SUSY partner states is taken to be potentially accessible in 8 TeV pp collisions, while all other SUSY masses are decoupled (set to inaccessibly large values). For both of these binolike NLSP cases, production proceeds solely through this set of SUSY partners, with the NLSP appearing in the subsequent decays of the produced SUSY partner states. For the gluino-bino model, the set of partners is composed of a degenerate octet of gluinos. For the wino-bino model, the set of partners is composed of a degenerate triplet of wino states\u03c7 0 2 ,\u03c7 AE 1 , and is dominated by the production of\u03c7 \u00fe 1\u03c7 \u2212 1 and\u03c7 0 2\u03c7 AE 1 . For both of these models, the masses of these produced states are considered to be free parameters along with that of the chosen\u03c7 0 1 state, the latter of which is constrained to be less than those of the produced states. This results in a SUSY production process that proceeds through the creation of pairs of the highermass states, which subsequently decay through short cascades to the NLSP\u03c7 0 1 states. Other SM objects (jets, leptons, photons) may be produced in these cascades. Th\u1ebd \u03c7 0 1 branching fraction to \u03b3 \u00feG is 100% for m~\u03c70 1 \u2192 0 and approaches cos 2 \u03b8 W for m~\u03c70",

The GGM SU(3) mass parameter M 3 bears a direct relation to the gluino mass, and is taken to be a free parameter in this \u03bc < 0 higgsino-bino model, with all squark states decoupled. The GGM SU(2) mass parameter M 2 is set to a value of 2.5 TeV. Four other electroweak gaugino states typically lie within 25 GeV of the\u03c7 0 1 NLSP: the two lightest charginos\u03c7 AE 1 , and two additional neutralinos\u03c7 0 2 and\u03c7 0 3 . The pair production of gluinos or any of these four additional gaugino states leads to decays to th\u1ebd \u03c7 0 1 via cascades involving SM particles. For the second of the higgsino-bino models, which is the focus of the photon \u00fe j analysis, the \u03bc parameter is chosen to be positive, which suppresses the h \u00feG decay mode of the higgsino. As in the models described above, the NLSP mass is taken to be a free parameter. The M 1 and \u03bc parameters are adjusted so that the branching fractions of the\u03c7 0 1 to \u03b3 \u00feG, Z \u00feG and h \u00feG are maintained close to 50%, 49% and 1% for most values of the\u03c7 0 1 and gluino masses. In this model, the production of gluino pairs can be followed by decays to both a single photon and a hadronically decaying Z boson, producing events with a single isolated high-energy photon accompanied by two jets. In the case that the gluino mass is substantially larger than th\u1ebd \u03c7 0 1 mass, additional jets can be produced in the cascade. Three additional electroweak gaugino states lie close in mass to the\u03c7 0 1 , allowing for the possibility of SUSY production through pairs of these states. Such events tend to produce fewer jets than those that proceed through gluino production, but in certain regions of the model space can provide a significant contribution to data samples selected to isolate the photon-plus-jets signature. As in the \u03bc < 0 higgsino-bino model, the value of M 3 , which is directly related to the gluino mass, is taken to be a free parameter, M 2 is set to a value of 2.5 TeV, and all squark states are decoupled.

Production proceeds through the direct production of pairs of NLSP states; such events usually contain at least oneW 0 NLSP. Although theW 0 couples preferentially to the Z boson relative to the photon, theW 0 decays into a photon \u00fe gravitino final state with unit branching fraction for wino mass below that of the Z boson. TheW 0 branching fraction to photon \u00fe gravitino approaches sin 2 \u03b8 W for wino masses far above that of the Z boson. Leptons can be produced either through the decays of charged wino states, or through the decays of Z bosons that arise fromW 0 decay, leading to a significant probability that the overall final state would contain both a photon and a lepton. In this model, a common wino mass scale is taken as a free parameter, with all other GGM mass parameters set to a value of 2.5 TeV, except the squark masses, which are set to infinity.

The simulation of W and Z boson production, including events with up to five accompanying partons, is calculated by two different generators. The ALPGEN 2.14 [39] Monte Carlo generator is interfaced to HERWIG 6.520 for showering and fragmentation and to JIMMY [40] for simulation of the underlying event. Parton distributions are provided by the CTEQ6L1 functions. Similar samples are produced with the SHERPA 1.4.1 generator [41] with CT10 [42] PDFs, for up to four accompanying partons.",

Outside the solenoid, fine-grained lead/ liquid-argon electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters provide coverage over j\u03b7j < 3.2 for the measurement of the energy and position of electrons and photons. A presampler, covering j\u03b7j < 1.8, is used to correct for energy lost upstream of the EM calorimeter. An iron/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter covers the region j\u03b7j < 1.7, while a copper/liquid-argon medium is used for hadronic calorimeters in the end cap region 1.5 < j\u03b7j < 3.2. In the forward region 3.2 < j\u03b7j < 4.9 liquid-argon calorimeters with copper and tungsten absorbers measure the electromagnetic and hadronic energy. A muon spectrometer consisting of three superconducting toroidal magnet systems, each comprising eight toroidal coils, tracking chambers, and detectors for triggering, surrounds the calorimeter system. The muon system reconstructs penetrating tracks over a range j\u03b7j < 2.7 and provides input to the trigger system over a range j\u03b7j < 2.4. A three-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels that together reduce the accepted event rate to 400 Hz on average depending on the data-taking conditions during 2012.",

Jets arising from detector noise, cosmic rays or other noncollision sources are rejected, as described in Ref. [67]. Each cluster is classified, prior to the jet reconstruction, as coming from an electromagnetic or hadronic shower on the basis of its shape [68]. Each cluster energy is then corrected by weighting electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits with correction factors derived from Monte Carlo simulation. A correction is applied to subtract the expected contamination from pileup, calculated as the product of the jet area in \u03b7-\u03d5 space and the average energy density of the event [69]. A further calibration, relating the response of the calorimeter to in situ jet-energy measurements [69] is then applied. Once calibrated, jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.8. Jets containing b-hadrons are identified using the MV1c b-tagging algorithm [70]. This neural network algorithm combines the information from various algorithms based on track impact-parameter significance or explicit reconstruction of b-and c-hadron decay vertices. The analyses presented in this paper use an operating point corresponding to 70% efficiency for jets originating from the fragmentation of a b-quark in simulated tt events, selecting approximately 0.7% of light-quark and gluon-induced jets and 20% of c-quark-induced jets.",

Finally, a requirement that the total transverse energy from jets with p T > 40 GeV (H jets T ) be less than 100 GeV helps reduce the backgrounds to SR \u03b3l e=\u03bc due to top quark production. A summary of the selection requirements specific to each of the diphoton SRs is presented in Table II,  and \u0394\u03d5 min \u00f0\u03b3; E miss T \u00de. Also shown are the expected contributions of SM processes, estimated as described in Sec. VII, as well as the expected m eff distributions for the \u00f0mg; m~\u03c70",

While these sources contribute generically to all four signatures explored in this study, the differing definitions of each of the associated SRs lead to, in many cases, significant differences in the manner in which the contributions of these various background sources are estimated. In the following, the methodology of the background estimation for each of the four experimental signatures is discussed, and the resulting background estimates, broken down by source, are tabulated. For the estimation of background contributions that rely upon MC simulation, either directly or through the estimation of \"transfer factors\" relating the background content of control regions to that of corresponding SRs, the effect of MC modeling uncertainties have been considered; in general, these uncertainties are found not to be dominant contributions to the overall uncertainty in the background estimates. Background models are confirmed in validation regions (VRs) with selection criteria closely related to those of the corresponding SR, but with one or more selection criteria modified to suppress the contribution of possible GGM signal to the VR.",

The second background component, referred to as \"EW background,\" is due to W \u00fe X (here \"X\" can be any number of jets, accompanied by no more than one photon; the two-photon case is treated separately) and tt events, with a smaller contribution arising from Z \u00fe X events.

A contribution from dijet QCD events is found to be small and largely incorporated into the photon \u00fe jet background estimate. To estimate the photon \u00fe jet contribution a \"QCD control sample\" is identified within the diphoton-trigger data sample by selecting events for which one photon candidate satisfies the tight selection criterion, while the other satisfies the loose but not the tight photon criterion. QCD control sample events containing electrons are vetoed to reduce contamination from W \u2192 e\u03bd decays.

W\u00f0\u2192 l\u03bd\u00de background events are further classified according to the origin of the highenergy isolated photon. Contributions from W\u00f0\u2192 l\u03bd\u00de backgrounds for which the photon arises from the misidentification of an electron are estimated via a control sample for which the photon requirement is replaced by an electron requirement, scaled by an electron-to-photon misidentification probability; this approach is similar in nature to that of the diphoton analysis. Estimates of this component of the background to SR \u03b3b L and SR \u03b3b H are shown in Table VI; the quoted uncertainty arises from the limited number of events in the control sample, as well as systematic uncertainty associated with the possible p T dependence of the electron-to-photon misidentification-rate scale factor.",

Separate control regions CR lep L and CR lep H are defined for the low-and high-neutralino-mass SRs by requiring a lepton in addition to the requirements already imposed to define the SRs. In addition, in order to increase the number of events in the CR, the E miss T requirement is reduced, the M bb requirement is removed (for the SR \u03b3b L analysis), and the H T requirement is relaxed (for the SR \u03b3b H analysis). Events in these two CRs are expected to be dominated by tt, tt\u03b3 and W\u03b3 production, as is expected for the corresponding background contributions to the SRs, and any overlapping phase space is subtracted as part of the background estimation. Including all SM sources, a total of 14.5 (58.0) events are expected in the CR lep L (CR lep H ) control regions, to be compared to an observation of 18 (61) events. Scaling the combined SM MC samples by these ratios of data to expectation, after having subtracted the contributions estimated by other techniques, yields the SR background estimates shown in Table VI. It is found that the data-to-expectation scale factor is somewhat dependent upon the requirements used to define the lepton-enriched CRs; these variations are included in the systematic error on the resulting SR background prediction.",

For the SR \u03b3b H analysis, three similar control samples are defined by requiring that no jet be identified as a b-jet, by requiring that E miss T < 150 GeV, or by requiring both of these SR modifications. A transfer factor is calculated by taking the ratio of the number of events with only the E miss T requirement changed to the number of events with both the E miss T and b-jet requirements changed. Assuming that the relaxation of the b-jet requirement is uncorrelated with the relaxation of the E miss T requirement, the number of QCD-background events in the SR can then be estimated by scaling, by this transfer factor, the number of events with only the b-tag requirement changed. This scaling is done only after subtracting the number of events expected to come from sources other than those that produce QCD-background events from each of the control samples. To avoid the biasing effects of possible correlations between the relaxation of the b-jet requirement and the E miss T requirement, for the SR \u03b3b L (SR \u03b3b H ) analysis events are binned in E miss T and weighted bin by bin in the ratio of the number of events in the 2-tag (1-tag) region to the number of events in the 1-tag (0-tag) region in the \u03b3 \u00fe jet MC sample.

The isolation-energy distribution for real photons is modeled with electrons from Z boson decays, while that of misidentified jets is modeled with a sample of events for which there is a \"pseudophoton.\" A pseudophoton is defined to be an object that passed all loose photon selection requirements, as well as all tight photon selection requirements except one or more from a set of four that relate to the shape of the deposition in the finely granulated front portion of the EM calorimeter. The fraction of misidentified jets within the tight, isolated photon sample is determined with a control sample composed of events with tight, isolated photons with p T > 125 GeV, as well as a relaxed E miss T requirement of 50 < E miss T < 150 GeV and an intermediate requirement of H T > 600 GeV. The photon isolation-energy distribution of this control sample is fit to establish the relative amounts of these two sources (real photons and misidentified jets), with the misidentification fraction taken to be the relative integrals of the isolationenergy distributions of the misidentified and total contributions in the region for which the isolation energy is less than 5 GeV. The estimation of the jet-misidentification background in each signal region and control sample (as well as for the validation regions described below) is then obtained by scaling the observed number of events in each range. The result for the contribution of the jet-misidentification backgrounds for each SR is shown in Table VII. Systematic uncertainties arise due to the uncertainties in the combined fit used to derive the misidentification factor, for which the parameters of the signal and background templates are allowed to vary within their uncertainties, and from the uncertainties of the extrapolation fit used for the estimation of the SR contamination.",

Uncertainties on the background expectations are treated as Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters in the maximum-likelihood fit. Assuming that no events due to physical processes beyond those of the SM populate the various CRs used to estimate SR backgrounds, observed 95% CL limits on the number of such events vary between 3.0 (for the SR \u03b3\u03b3 S\u2212L and SR \u03b3\u03b3 S\u2212H SRs) and 14.2 (for the SR \u03b3l e SR). Taking into account the integrated luminosity of 20.3 AE 0.6 fb \u22121 these number-of-event limits translate into 95% CL upper limits on the visible cross section for new physics, defined by the product of cross section, branching fraction, acceptance and efficiency for the different SR definitions. Correspondingly, the observed visible crosssection limits vary between 0.15 and 0.70 fb. By considering, in addition, the value and uncertainty of the acceptance times efficiency of the selection requirements associated with the various SRs, as well as the NLO (\u00feNLL) GGM cross sections [33][34][35][36][37], which vary steeply with gluino and gaugino mass, 95% CL lower limits may be set on the masses of these states in the context of the various GGM scenarios explored in this study.

Due to the discrete nature of the number-ofobserved-events likelihood distribution in background-only pseudoexperiments, when both the expected number of background events and its uncertainty are close to zero the expected limit is dominated by the case of zero observed events. This leads to a very narrow one-standard-deviation range for the expected limit \u22120.14 the best expected sensitivity at each simulated point in the parameter space of the corresponding GGM model(s) is used to determine the degree of exclusion of that model point. For the photon \u00fe l analysis, the 95% CL exclusion limits are derived from the combined likelihood of the electron and muon channels, taking into account the correlation between the systematic uncertainty estimates in the two channels.

The resulting observed limits on the gluino and wino masses are exhibited, as a function of bino mass, for the diphoton analysis gluino and wino production models in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.

Exclusion limits in the wino-bino mass plane, using the SR \u03b3\u03b3 W\u2212H analysis for m~\u03c70 1 \u2265 350 GeV and the SR \u03b3\u03b3 W\u2212L analysis for m~\u03c70 1 < 350 GeV. The vertical axis represents wino mass while the horizontal axis represents bino mass. The observed limits are exhibited for the nominal SUSY model crosssection expectation, as well as for a SUSY cross section increased and decreased by 1 standard deviation of the cross-section systematic uncertainty. Also shown is the expected limit, along with its AE1 standard-deviation range. The discontinuity at m~\u03c701 \u00bc 350 GeV is due to the switch between the use of the SR \u03b3\u03b3 W\u2212L and SR \u03b3\u03b3 W\u2212H analyses, the former of which exhibits a small excess of observed events relative to the expected SM background.",
