Detailed measurements of nuclear modification factors and energy flow of the aforementioned quenched jets are performed with the CMS detector. These new results extend previous measurements to large angles with respect to the quenched jets and increase reach in the transverse momentum range. High statistics pp, pPb and PbPb data taken in 2011-13 are used in the following analysis. A new data-driven method to estimate the underlying event contribution from the forward calorimeter energy distribution is employed which takes into account possible event by event flow modulation. The flavor dependence of energy loss of jets is studied by tagging heavy flavor b-jets in these systems.",

            "text": "Relativistic heavy-ions with sufficient energy density are expected to produce a strongly interacting medium known as the quark gluon plasma (QGP) [1]. Large transverse momentum (p T ) jets are of a special importance because their medium interactions lead to a modification in their yield, i.e. they are quenched [2] when compared to pp collisions at the same energy. This was seen at RHIC in central AuAu collisions [3,4,5,6] and at the LHC [7]. Recent datasets with integrated luminosity 150 \u00b5b \u2212 at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV) is used for the calculation of the nuclear modification factor. The jet quenching effect is assumed to be dependent on the flavor of the fragmenting quark. For example when the parton p T is comparable with the parton mass, the radiation is expected to be less due to the dead-cone effect [8]. Heavy flavor quark jets are tagged using a discriminant based on the displaced vertex and the b-jet yields are compared between the three systems to study the flavor dependence of quenching. A novel method of studying the distribution of track p T around the jet axis for a particular jet (in a dijet system) is performed to recover the energy lost due to quenching by going to large jet radii in the \u03c6, \u03b7 plane. The detector coordinate system is defined with \u03c6 as the azimuthal angle and \u03b7, the pseudorapidity. The differences in charged particle multiplicity and momentum flow carried by charged particles near the leading and the sub-leading jets in dijet events are measured in PbPb and pp systems.",

Jets are reconstructed using the CMS particle flow algorithm [10] which combines all stable particle signatures like calorimeter deposits, track information and muon chamber hits. These particle flow objects are then clustered using the anti-k T algorithm [11] encoded in the FastJet [12] framework. The clustering algorithms use a resolution parameter R, which is a p T weighted distance between objects in the \u03b7 and \u03c6 space to specify the \"size\" of the reconstructed jet. To study the momentum flow in dijet measurements, calorimetric jets that are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters are used. A discriminator called the Simple Secondary Vertex tagger (SSV) [13] which is based on the flight distance significance of the reconstructed secondary vertices is used to tag heavy flavor jets. The Underlying Event (UE) contribution or the background energy is removed using an iterative-pileup subtraction technique [14]. The HF/Voronoi algorithm [15] is a new background subtraction method which models the central underlying event density as a nonlinear response of the HF azimuthal profile. This improves the estimation of the central UE by incorporating several non-zero components of the anisotropic flow of the QGP. The estimated energy is subtracted on particle level and is later equalized to even out non physical negative energies (which arise due to the subtraction).",

In contrast to the PbPb measurement, the pPb modification factor does not show any enhancement or suppression in the p T range reconstructed for inclusive jets and b-jets. To further quantify the energy loss in the quenched jets, the momentum flow of tracks in unbalanced dijet pairs in both PbPb and pp collisions is studied. There is about 35 GeV/c of p T missing from the most quenched jet in these asymmetric back to back dijet pairs.
