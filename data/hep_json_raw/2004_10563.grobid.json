The measurements are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the LHCb experiment. The polarisation is determined in a fiducial region of \u039b 0 b transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of 1 < p T < 20 GeV/c and 2 < \u03b7 < 5, respectively. The data are consistent with \u039b 0 b baryons being produced unpolarised in this region. The parity-violating asymmetry parameter of the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay is also determined from the data and its value is found to be consistent with a recent measurement by the BES III collaboration.",

The spin- 1 2 \u039b 0 b baryon can provide information about the production of hadrons containing b quarks. For example, the \u039b 0 b polarisation is closely related to that of the b quark [1]. Heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) predicts that \u039b 0 b baryons originating from energetic b quarks retain a large fraction of the transverse b-quark polarisation [2,3]. The longitudinal polarisation is expected to vanish in pp collisions due to parity conservation in strong interactions and the term polarisation is used to refer to the transverse polarisation of particles in this paper. The authors of ref. [4] estimate that the b-quark polarisation is of the order of 10%. This leads to an estimate that the polarisation of the \u039b 0 b baryon can be around 10% with possible values up to 20% [1,5]. Measurements of \u039b polarisation at fixed-target experiments [6][7][8] find that the polarisation strongly depends on Feynman-x, x F , with polarisation vanishing at x F = 0.

            "text": "x F is defined by x F = 2p L / \u221a s, where p L is the longitudinal momentum of the baryon with respect to the beam line and \u221a s is the centre-of-mass energy of the collision. If a similar x F -dependence is present in \u039b 0 b -baryon production, a negligible polarisation would be expected at the LHC since the experiments mostly cover the phase-space region close to x F = 0. In addition, several heavy b-baryon states are observed experimentally [9][10][11][12][13]. In the production of \u039b 0 b baryons from decays of these states, the connection between the \u039b 0 b and the b-quark polarisation can be further diluted due to the interaction of the b quark with the light quarks in the heavy b-baryon [1,3]. The fraction of the b-quark polarisation transferred to the \u039b 0 b baryon is estimated to be around 75% in ref. [1]. The decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b, where the \u039b baryon decays to p\u03c0 \u2212 and the J/\u03c8 meson decays to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , can be used to measure the polarisation of the \u039b 0 b baryon as well as to test the theoretical understanding of hadronic decays of \u039b 0 b baryons. 1 The angular distribution of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b decay is described by the polarisation of the \u039b 0 b baryon, P b , four decay amplitudes and by the parity-violating asymmetry parameter of the \u039b baryon decay, \u03b1 \u039b . The decay parameter \u03b1 \u039b arises due to the V\u2212A nature of the weak interaction [14]. The four decay amplitudes, A(\u03bb \u039b , \u03bb J/\u03c8 ) correspond to different \u039b and J/\u03c8 helicities, \u03bb \u039b and \u03bb J/\u03c8 . The notation a \u00b1 = A(\u00b1 1 2 , 0) and b \u00b1 = A(\u2213 1 2 , \u00b11) is used in this paper. In the naive heavy-quark and light-diquark limit, the u and d quark in the baryon form a spin-and isospin-zero spectator system. The left-handed nature of the charged-current interaction then implies that the \u039b-baryon helicity is \u2212 1 2 , such that |a + | \u2248 |b \u2212 | \u2248 0. Several theoretical approaches have been used to predict the \u039b 0 b parity-violating decay parameter",

            "text": "Both measurements were performed using an angular analysis of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b decay. The LHCb measurement used data collected at \u221a s = 7 TeV, while the CMS measurement used data from both 7 and 8 TeV pp collisions. A similar analysis was performed by the JHEP06(2020)110 ATLAS collaboration [28] but assuming P b = 0 and measuring only magnitudes of the decay amplitudes. While all three measurements are compatible, the LHCb and CMS results are unphysical; the LHCb value of |b \u2212 | 2 and the CMS value of |a + | 2 are negative. This is likely to be due to the use of a now outdated value of \u03b1 \u039b = 0.642 \u00b1 0.013 from an earlier Particle Data Group average of the results of refs. [29][30][31][32][33] that is no longer used. This value is significantly smaller than that measured by the BES III collaboration using J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u039b\u039b decays [34]. In their analysis, the BES III collaboration determine \u03b1 \u039b and \u03b1 \u039b , for the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 + decays, to be \u03b1 \u039b = 0.750 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.004 and \u03b1 \u039b = \u22120.758 \u00b1 0.010 \u00b1 0.007. The BES III measurement is supported by a reanalysis of CLAS \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u039b scattering data in ref. [35], which gives \u03b1 \u039b = 0.721 \u00b1 0.006 \u00b1 0.005. The polarisation of \u039b 0 b baryons has also been determined to be P b = (0 \u00b1 5)% in the LHCb acceptance using \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, under the assumption that the polarisation is independent of \u221a s [36]. This paper describes a measurement of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b angular distribution using data collected with the LHCb experiment during Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC. The data set corresponds to 1.0, 2.0 and 1.9 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV in 2011, 2012 and 2015-2016, respectively. A measurement of the polarisation and the decay amplitudes is made, using the BES III value of \u03b1 \u039b as an input. The polarisation of \u039b 0 b baryons is measured for the first time at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The paper starts by describing the angular formalism used in the analysis in section 2. Section 3 introduces the LHCb detector. Section 4 describes the selection of candidates from the LHCb data set. The yields of \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b decays in the different data sets are obtained in section 5. Section 6 describes the procedure used to correct the data for the nonuniformity of the reconstruction and selection. The production polarisation and decay amplitudes are obtained through a two-step procedure described in sections 7 and 9. Section 8 discusses sources of systematic uncertainty in the measurement. Finally, conclusions are presented in section 10.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [41], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [42,43] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp collision vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + (29 GeV/c)/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [44]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [45], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the muon system and calorimeters, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Samples of simulated events are required to model the effects of the detector acceptance and the imposed selection requirements on the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b angular distribution.

            "text": "Signal candidates are formed by combining a J/\u03c8 -meson candidate with a \u039b-baryon candidate. The J/\u03c8 candidates are reconstructed from two oppositely charged tracks that have been identified as muons. The muons are required to have a significant IP with respect to all PVs in the event and form a common vertex with a good vertex-fit quality. The dimuon mass is required to be in the range 2900 < m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 3150 MeV/c 2 . The \u039b candidates are reconstructed in two categories: \u039b baryons that decay early enough for the proton and pion to be reconstructed in the vertex detector; and \u039b baryons that decay later, such that they cannot be reconstructed in the vertex detector. These categories are referred to as long and downstream, respectively. The \u039b candidates in the long category have a better mass, momentum and vertex resolution than those in the downstream category. Approximately two thirds of the candidates are reconstructed in the downstream category. For both categories, the proton and pion are required to be significantly displaced from all PVs in the event and form a common vertex with a good vertex-fit quality. The \u039b candidates are also required to have an invariant mass within 30 MeV/c 2 of the known \u039b-baryon mass [54], a decay time larger than 2 ps and a decay vertex at z < 2350 mm. The z-axis is aligned with the LHC beam line, with positive z in the direction of the LHCb detector acceptance, where z = 0 corresponds approximately to the centre of the pp interaction region. The vertex position requirement is imposed to remove background from material interactions in front of the large-area silicon-strip detector. The \u039b 0 b candidate is associated with the PV relative to which it has smallest \u03c7 2 IP , where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in the vertex-fit \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without a considered particle. The \u039b 0 b candidate is required to have a good vertex-fit quality, to be consistent with originating from its associated PV and to have a vertex position that is significantly displaced from that PV. A kinematic fit is then performed, constraining the masses of the J/\u03c8 and \u039b candidates to their known values [54] and constraining the \u039b 0 b candidate to originate from its associated PV. The signal candidates are required to have passed a hardware trigger that selects either a single muon with a large transverse momentum or a pair of muons with a large product of their individual transverse momenta. The software trigger requires a candidate to be at least partially reconstructed with a secondary vertex that has a significant displacement from any PV. At least one charged particle must have a large p T and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate discriminator [55] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

To reduce the complexity of the parameterisation, an iterative approach is used, where the efficiency model is constructed in stages. At the first stage, each dimension is parameterised independently and the simulated decays are corrected by the inverse of this simplified efficiency model. At the second stage, three-dimensional corrections are determined separately for (cos \u03b8 l , \u03c6 l , cos \u03b8) and for (cos \u03b8 b , \u03c6 b , cos \u03b8), which are subsequently applied to the simulated decays.

The resolution, determined using simulated decays, is approximately 3 mrad in \u03b8 and \u03b8 l , 20 mrad in \u03b8 b , 10 mrad in \u03c6 l and 45 mrad in \u03c6 b .

No significant correlation is found between the mass and angular distribution of simulated \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b decays. The variables are also found to be uncorrelated for the combinatorial background. However, a correlation is seen between the mass and angular distributions of misidentified B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S decays. The impact of neglecting this correlation is tested using pseudoexperiments, with the mass and angular distributions of the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S decays taken from a detailed simulation. The values of the moments are then determined neglecting the correlation and the resulting bias is taken as a systematic uncertainty. In principle there is also an effect arising from neglecting the precession of the \u039b-baryon spin in the external magnetic field of the experiment. The precession is small due to the small size of the integrated field between the production and decay points of the \u039b baryon.",

The last term in the likelihood originates from the external constraints from BES III on the value of \u03b1 \u039b . In this analysis, the recent BES III result [34] for the \u039b asymmetry parameter is used. Averaging the BES III values for \u039b and \u039b decays yields \u03b1 BES \u039b = 0.754 with an uncertainty \u03c3(\u03b1 BES \u039b ) = 0.003. The value of \u03b1 \u039b and the values of the complex amplitudes a \u00b1 and b \u00b1 are shared between the different data sets but the polarisation is allowed to differ between different centre-of-mass energies. The Bayesian analysis procedure has been validated for both small and large values of the polarisation using pseudoexperiments.    Table 5. Estimates for the magnitude and phase of the decay amplitudes and the transverse production polarisation of the \u039b 0 b baryons, extracted using the Bayesian analysis. The most probable value (MPV) and the shortest 68% interval containing the most probable value are given. The posterior distribution of \u03b1 \u039b with the constraint on \u03b1 \u039b removed, assuming a uniform prior in the range [\u22121, +1], is shown in figure 7. The most probable value of \u03b1 \u039b is 0.74. The 68% credibility interval spans [0.71, 0.78]. The data strongly favour the larger \u03b1 \u039b value reported by the BES III collaboration [34] over the values from older secondary scattering measurements [29][30][31][32][33], which are excluded with high significance. Small values of \u03b1 \u039b are excluded by the large p\u03c0 \u2212 forward-backward asymmetry observed in the cos \u03b8 b distribution. Larger values of \u03b1 \u039b can be accommodated by changing the magnitudes of the decay amplitudes to reduce the asymmetry. ",

The measurements are performed in a fiducial region of \u039b 0 b transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of 1 < p T < 20 GeV/c and 2 < \u03b7 < 5, respectively. The magnitudes of two of the four decay amplitudes are found to be small. One of these amplitudes corresponds to \u039b helicity of + 1 2 and J/\u03c8 helicity of 0 and the other to \u039b helicity of \u2212 1 2 and J/\u03c8 helicity of \u22121. This is consistent with the expectation from the heavy-quark limit and the left-handed nature of the weak interaction. The parity-violating parameter \u03b1 b is found to be consistent with zero, with a 68% credibility interval from \u22120.048 to 0.005. The small negative value of \u03b1 b favoured by the data is consistent with most theoretical predictions but is inconsistent with the prediction based on HQET in ref. [5]. The \u039b 0 b production polarisation is found to be consistent with zero, with 68% credibility level intervals of [\u22120.06, 0.05], [\u22120.04, 0.05] and [\u22120.01, 0.07] at \u221a s of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, respectively.

The magnitude and phase of b + are fixed to be |b + | = 1 and arg(b + ) = 0. This amplitude is one of the two amplitudes that are expected to be large. The remaining amplitudes are measured relative to b + . A uniform prior is assumed on their magnitudes and phases and on P b . The priors use the ranges [\u22121, +1] for P b , [\u2212\u03c0, +\u03c0] for the phases, and the range [0, 20] for the magnitudes of the amplitudes. The values of the amplitudes and the polarisations are given in table 5. The 95% credibility intervals are provided in table 6 of the appendix.Figure 5shows P b as a function of the \u221a s of the data set. The resulting \u039b 0 b polarisation at each centre-of-mass energy is found to be consistent with zero. The Markov chain finds two almost-degenerate solutions, which correspond to a change in sign of the polarisation accompanied by a change in sign of the decay amplitudes. This occurs due to the small size of two of the amplitudes. The degeneracy is most visible in the posterior distribution of P b determined at \u221a s of 13 TeV, leading to an asymmetric distribution. Due to the small size of polarisation, there is little sensitivity to the phases of the amplitudes. The magnitudes of the amplitudes a + and b \u2212 are consistent with zero at the 95% credibility level, as expected in the heavy-quark limit. The magnitudes of a \u2212 and b + are found to be similar in size.Figure 6shows the posterior distribution of the",
