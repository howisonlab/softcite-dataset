Two-particle correlations in relative azimuth (\u0394\u03d5) and pseudorapidity (\u0394\u03b7) are expected to exhibit several structures which arise from different physics mechanisms and allow us to study the wide landscape of correlations. The results include the dependence of the correlation function on the event multiplicity, the charge combination and species (pions, kaons or protons) of particles in the pair.",

Such studies often involve the measurement of relative angles \u0394\u03d5 and \u0394\u03b7, where \u0394\u03b7 = \u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 is the difference in pseudorapidity, \u0394\u03d5 = \u03d5 1 \u2212 \u03d5 2 is the difference in azimuthal angle. In general, correlation functions are sensitive to different sources i.e. minijets, elliptic flow, Bose-Einstein correlations, resonance decays, photon conversions, etc [1,2]. Contributions from those correlations create distinctive structures in \u0394\u03b7\u0394\u03d5 space. The goal of this study is to decompose them and quantify each contribution separately.",

Tracks were required to have a Distance of Closest Approach (DCA) to the reconstructed collision vertex smaller than 2 cm in the beam direction. In the transverse plane, a p T dependent cut was applied and only particles within (0.018 + 0.035p \u22121.01 T ) cm from the primary vertex were accepted. Furthermore, we applied a cut to remove electron-positron pairs which were produced from photon conversions. It was achieved by removing pairs constructed of one positive and one negative particle that have small polar angle difference (\u0394\u03b8 < 0.008) and invariant mass m inv < 0.002 (close to 0, the rest mass of the photon).

Figure 1 presents the dependence of the parameters of the full fit, for three charge combinations, as a function of the charged particle multiplicity density dN ch /d\u03b7 (number of charged particles per pseudorapidity unit), with no selection on the pair momentum. Below we briefly describe the trends seen in the plot. The panels in the top row show the parameters of the near-side component. We observe a distinct difference between the same and opposite charge pairs; the latter show a significantly wider peak, which reflects a stronger correlation effect. We also see that this peak has an exponent smaller than unity, meaning that the shape is more peaked than a Gaussian. We observe that both the magnitude and the width of the peak decrease with multiplicity. Such behavior is expected due to the construction of the correlation function for correlations coming from minijets. The higher the particle multiplicity, the smaller the correlation per pair.",

We can observe significantly different shapes of the correlation functions for different particle species. The correlation function is the strongest (the near-side peak is most distinct) for kaon pairs and significantly lower for pions and protons, both for like-and unlikesign pairs. Moreover, a surprising behavior can be seen for like-sign proton pairs, where a wide anti-correlation dip with minimum at (\u0394\u03b7, \u0394\u03d5) = (0, 0) can be observed. To explain these results we propose the following hypothesis. For the production of different types of particles (pions, kaons, protons) different conservation laws come into play, as summarized in Tab. 1. For pions, only momentum and electric charge must be conserved. Charged kaons contain strange quarks; so, they carry strangeness. Therefore, in case of kaons, also the strangeness must be conserved. Protons are baryons; so, the baryon number must be conserved. Since every single collision is an independent system, it must conserve all of these quantities. If those laws are conserved for the whole event we are defining the global conservation laws (i.e. the total strangeness of all produced particles should be zero). Moreover, all the quantum numbers must be conserved for each parton fragmentation separately (i.e. the total strangeness of all particles in the single jet must be zero) [17][18][19][20][21][22]. We would define local conservation laws, as conservation laws that are obeyed for each parton fragmentation. We test at which scale this conservation takes place, since they should influence the shape of the correlation function, especially in small systems. The study of different particle species in pp events shall allow to determine that. All of those must be taken into account while interpreting the results of the angular correlations analysis.",

It is most prominent (the correlation is strongest) for kaons, lower for protons, and the weakest for pions. This observation is consistent with our assumption that the conservation laws play a main role in defining the shape of the correlation function. The basic solution that would ensure conservation of all the laws is the production of particle-antiparticle pair. Moreover, it is always energetically most favorable to compensate particles with their antiparticles. The strength of the correlation depends on the energetic price of the alternative solution. If the alternative solution is \"cheap\" then the unlike-sign pairs (pairs constructed of particle and its antiparticle) will be less correlated, than for the \"expensive\" alternative solutions, where the correlation will be stronger: (1) for pions the alternative solution is just another opposite-charge particle, and the cost of such a solution is relatively low; so, the correlation is weakest, (2) for protons another anti-baryon (charged, or neutral plus additional charged particle) would have to be produced. Such solutions are less probable (the energetic price is higher) than in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 case which results in stronger near-side correlation, (3) for kaons, which carry the strange quark, the strangeness must be conserved; so, the alternative solution would be at least a \u039b particle together with another baryon. The energetic price of such solution is very high, therefore the creation of K + K \u2212 pair is much more favorable and the correlation is the strongest.   For like-sign pairs different mechanisms play a role determining the shape of the correlation function. Producing two identical particles is no longer the \"cheapest solution\". For correlations of such particles their masses play a significant role. The pions are light particles (with rest mass close to 0.139 GeV/c), kaons are heavier (with a rest mass about 0.949 GeV/c) and protons are the heaviest (with rest mass close to 0.938 GeV/c) of the analyzed particles. In the case of like-sign pairs also the femtoscopic effects which increase the correlation have to be taken into account.",

In the case of protons a large dip near the (\u0394\u03b7, \u0394\u03d5) = (0, 0) is present. It is due to the fact, that producing two protons, two identical heavy particles, in roughly the same direction, is less probable, than the similar production of some lighter particles. In the case of two identical protons produced in a similar direction automatically we would have to produce also two anti-baryons (i.e. two antiprotons) in the opposite direction; so, another two heavy particles. The cost of such a solution is high; so, such cases are rare and therefore we see a dip in the correlation function. The correlation functions obtained from Pythia Perugia-0 are presented in Fig. 4 for unlike-sign pairs and in Fig. 5 for like-sign pairs of protons, kaons and pions. Correlation functions obtained from Phojet are very similar to Pythia. There are significant differences between the results obtained from MC models and from the ALICE collision data (figures 2 and 3). The results show that in the studied MC models the strongest correlation exists between unlike-sign pairs of protons, not for kaons as is the case of the results of the analysis of collision data. Furthermore, there is a significant near-side peak instead of anti-correlation dip for the like-sign proton pairs. The results suggests that conservation laws, especially the baryon conservation law, are not modeled properly in the tested MC generators.",
