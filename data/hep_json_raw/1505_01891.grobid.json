Its determination would represent an important step in the formulation of the generalized model, and would have a profound impact on the quest of the nature of neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana) and the search for a theory of flavor. In this review, we summarize the status of experimental and theoretical work in this field and explore the future opportunities that emerge in light of the recently discovered non-zero and relatively large third neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 .",

Among them the existence of non-vanishing neutrino masses has a prominent position. Despite the obvious difficulty of experiments involving neutrinos, it is now clear beyond any doubt that neutrinos have masses, albeit tiny, and that they mix, unlike the assumptions of the standard model. Thanks to the discoveries of the last twenty years, we now have a simple three-flavor description of these new phenomena that explains most of the data. Despite the success, this is not the end of the story. Further experimental and theoretical effort is needed so that the next step, formulation of a new theory that encompasses the new insight into the neutrino physics, can be accomplished.",

Obviously, the inverted hierarchy represents the opposite situation. Note that the word hierarchy is used throughout this work even if the lightest neutrino mass m L (\u03bd 1 for the NH and \u03bd 3 in the IH) could be comparable to the other two masses, i.e. when all three masses are much larger than the \u2206m 2 ij (so called degenerate scenario).",

There are at best only a handful of the galactic core-collapse supernovae per century and their neutrino emission and detection is a complicated matter. On the other hand, neutrino sky coverage by the sufficiently large detectors has been on for about three decades already, and will continue in the foreseeable future. There is, therefore, a good chance that a high statistics SN neutrino sample will eventually become a reality and that the neutrino mass hierarchy can be deduced from its analysis. It is possible, perhaps even likely, that the SN neutrino spectra are not universal; they might depend on the progenitor mass, accretion or rotation. Nevertheless, some general features exist. Only recently it has been recognized that in the deep core region where the neutrino densities are very large the neutrino self-interaction could result in a hierarchy dependent collective flavor conversion. (For a review see Ref. [14]). Generally, this flavor conversion is not expected to affect the \u03bd and\u03bd spectra in the case of NH, but will alter significantly and differently the \u03bd and\u03bd spectra in the case of IH. In addition, the neutrino spectra will be affected by the resonant matter effect in the outer lower mass density layers of the supernova. Resonance occurs for neutrinos in the case of NH and antineutrinos in the case of IH. Also, the detected signal could be possibly altered by the matter effect during the transitions through earth (for general references see the review in Ref. [15]).

Both experiments were reactor antineutrino experiments searching for oscillations of\u03bd e at baselines of \u223c1 km with a single-detector configuration. No oscillations were observed in either experiment and an upper limit of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.12 was set at 90% confidence level (C.L.) by CHOOZ. Almost 10 years later, in 2011, several hints suggested a non-zero \u03b8 13 . The first one was based on a tension [19] between the KamLAND\u03bd e disappearance measurement (a reactor antineutrino experiment at an average baseline of \u223c180 km) and the solar neutrino measurements (e.g. ratio of \u03bd e charge-current to \u03bd e,\u00b5,\u03c4 neutral-current interactions from SNO). Subsequently, accelerator neutrino experiments MINOS [20] and T2K [21] reported on their searches of \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e appearance oscillation that is sensitive to \u03b8 13 .

By then, non-zero \u03b8 13 was firmly established. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows the current global status of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 measurements compiled with the latest results from each experiment. The precision of this important parameter is still being improved by the current-generation experiments. In particular, the right panel of Fig. 4 shows the expected uncertainty of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 from the Daya Bay experiment; by the end of the experiment it is expected to reach a better than 3% measurement precision of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 .

            "text": "The accelerator neutrino experiments provided and continue to provide crucial inputs to the development of the 3-flavor PMNS model. Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger already in 1960's discovered the muon flavor neutrinos [33] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and showed that the lepton flavor appears to be conserved in the weak interaction. The tau flavor neutrinos \u03bd \u03c4 , the second to last elementary particle in the Standard Model experimentally confirmed, was discovered by the DONUT collaboration at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) [34] in 2001. The K2K longbaseline experiment [35] confirmed the observation of the neutrino oscillation at energies comparable to those produced in the atmosphere. The OPERA experiment provided the evidence for \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd \u03c4 appearance [36]. The MINOS long-baseline experiment [37] provided the most precise measurement of the atmospheric mass-squared splitting \u2206m 2 32 . Very recently, the T2K experiment [27] discovered for the first time ever the neutrino appearance oscillation (\u03bd e appearance from \u03bd \u00b5 ), at more than 5\u03c3 statistical significance, and confirmed the \"large\" non-zero \u03b8 13 discovered in the Daya Bay experiment [38]. The T2K experiment [27] together with the reactor neutrino experiments in Refs. [39,40,41] provide an initial interesting hint of the leptonic CP violation. The most precise measurement of the atmospheric mixing angle \u03b8 23 also comes from the T2K experiment. Besides the possible determination of MH, the accelerator neutrino experiments are currently the only known reliable way to measure CP phase \u03b4 CP , as well as determining the \u03b8 23 octant: whether the \u03bd 3 contains more muon neutrino \u03bd \u00b5 or tau neutrino \u03bd \u03c4 . Furthermore, the measurement of the third neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 from accelerator experiments together with the measurement of \u03b8 13 from reactor antineutrino experiments provides a nice unitarity test of the PMNS matrix [42]. Figure 5: A schematic view of the conventional neutrino beamline. The magnetic field is toroidal and assumed to focus positive charged particle. The muon neutrinos and antineutrinos are mainly generated through the two-body decay of pions and kaons. The electron neutrinos and antineutrinos, one of the main backgrounds for the electron neutrino/antineutrino appearance measurement, are mainly generated through the three-body decay of kaons and muons. The dashed line illustrates the direction of very short-lived \u03c0 o .",

A schematic view of a conventional neutrino beamline is shown in Fig. 5. First, energetic secondary pions and kaons are produced when high-energy proton beams interact with the nuclear target. Second, some of the charged pions and kaons within certain momentum range are focused by magnets (also known as horns), so that they are approximately traveling in parallel with the incident proton beam direction. The polarity of the magnet can be selected by changing the current in order to focus either the positive or negative charged particles. The charged pions and kaons then travel through a long decay pipe to provide enough time for them to decay. Finally, a thick absorber is placed at the end of decay pipe to absorb the muons (decay products of pions and kaons) and other remaining charged particles. The \"on-axis\" neutrino  Figure 6: Neutrino fluxes for different species are shown for the Fermilab Booster neutrino beamline [44]. Left (right) panel represents the positive (negative) polarity which focuses positive (negative) charged particles in the magnetic horn.

The accelerator-produced neutrinos are generally detected through the charged-current interaction with nucleon/nuclei in the detector.

E l , p l , and \u03b8 l are the energy, momentum, and polar angle of the scattered charged lepton. E B is the separation energy. The above method has a systematic bias, as the reaction mechanism should include the Fermi motion, involvement of more than one nucleon in the initial state (such as the short-range correlation), and final state interactions. The correct modeling of the reaction mechanism in the neutrino event generator is thus crucial. Another example is the deep inelastic scattering. The neutrino energy can be reconstructed by the calorimetry method, which sums the charged lepton energy with the energy of the hadronic system. In this method, the correct modeling of the hadronic energy response in the simulation and the correct estimation of the missing energy due to neutral particles (neutron and neutrino) becomes essential. Fig. 8 shows the calculated \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e appearance oscillation probability vs. the ratio L/E \u03bd . Due to the matter effect, the different MH leads to different behavior for the neutrino and antineutrino oscillations. In particular, at the first oscillation maximum L/E \u03bd \u223c 510 km/GeV, the normal (inverted) MH would enhance the neutrino (antineutrino) oscillations, but suppress the antineutrino (neutrino) oscillations. Therefore, by precision measurements of the \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e and the\u03bd \u00b5 to\u03bd e oscillations, MH can be determined. Comparing to Fig. 2, which is evaluated at fixed baseline L = 1300 km, Fig. 8 is made by scanning L at fixed neutrino energy E \u03bd = 2 GeV. Due to this choice, the matter effect is significant in the second and higher oscillation maxima in Fig. 8. On the other hand, it is not as important for the second and higher oscillation maxima in Fig. 2 as the neutrino energy is much lower.",

The positively charged pions decay to a positively charged muon and a muon neutrino. The positively charged muons further decay to a positron, an electron neutrino, and a muon antineutrino.

The atmospheric neutrino flux contains four neutrino species (\u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e ,\u03bd e ) and the detectors are usually only sensitive to the neutrino flavor. Therefore, one cannot disentangle the muon neutrino disappearance from the electron neutrino to muon neutrino appearance. Similarly, one cannot disentangle the electron neutrino disappearance from the muon neutrino to electron neutrino appearance. Nevertheless, they can still be sensitive to the matter effect, as the modification of neutrino oscillations due to the matter effect is large. In addition, as the neutrino flux is higher than the antineutrino flux and the neutrino-nuclei cross section is larger than the antineutrino-nuclei cross section, one could determine MH with a detector that is not sensitive to the lepton (in practice muon) charge. The sensitivity to MH can be further enhanced with a magnetized detector which is sensitive to the muon charge. ",

            "text": "Reactor antineutrino experiments have a glorious history. In 1956, Cowan and Reines first experimentally discovered neutrinos at the Savannah River reactor power plant in the U.S. [58]. In 2005, the KamLAND experiment in Japan observed the neutrino oscillations in the solar sector [59]. Recently, the Daya Bay experiment in China, the RENO experiment in Korea, and the Double-Chooz experiment in France reported the discovery of non-zero \u03b8 13 , the third neutrino mixing angle in 2012 [23,24,22]. In the future, besides the determination of the mass hierarchy, the reactor neutrino experiments will also provide precision measurements of neutrino mixing parameters including the mixing angles \u03b8 13 and \u03b8 12 and the mass-squared splittings \u2206m 2 32 and \u2206m 2 21 . Nuclear power reactors produce electricity by the sustained nuclear chain reaction, and are essentially pure electron antineutrino\u03bd e sources. In every nuclear fission \u223c200 MeV energy is released together with on average six\u03bd e emitted by the \u03b2-decay of the fission fragments. 1 For each 1 gigawatt (GW) of the reactor thermal power, about 2\u00d710 20\u03bd e are emitted isotropically every second, making nuclear reactors one of the most powerful man-made neutrino sources. 235 U and 238 U, together with the 239 Pu and 242 Pu produced by breeding in the reactor, are the main sources of the reactor\u03bd e . The corresponding\u03bd e energy spectra are shown in Fig. 13. The primary method to detect reactor\u03bd e is using the inverse beta decay (IBD) reaction\u03bd e +p \u2192 e + +n in which electron antineutrino interacts with a free proton. The final state particles are a positron and a neutron. An IBD event is represented by a coincident signal consisting of i) a prompt signal induced by the positron ionization and annihilation inside the detector such as a liquid scintillator (LS) detector and ii) a delayed signal produced by the neutron capture on a proton or a nucleus (such as Gd) with a large neutron capture cross section. In particular, the neutron capture on Gd releases multiple gammas with a total energy \u223c8 MeV. With 0.1% Gd-doped LS, the average time between the prompt and the delayed signal is about 30 \u00b5s. In comparison, for neutron capture on hydrogen a single gamma with energy of \u223c2.2 MeV is emitted. For liquid scintillator C n H \u223c2n , the average time between the prompt and the delayed signal is about 200 \u00b5s. Fig. 14 illustrates the reaction and detection principle of the IBD process. The cross section of the IBD process is shown as the solid black line in Fig. 13 with units showing on the right axis. The convoluted energy spectrum, i.e. the product of the reactor antineutrino flux and the IBD cross section, is plotted as the dashed line. It begins at the threshold of \u223c1.8 MeV neutrino energy E \u03bd , and peaks around 4 MeV. The tail of the spectrum extends beyond 8 MeV. Due to the time and space correlations, IBD can be easily distinguished from radioactive backgrounds which mostly consist of only a single signal. Furthermore, the energy of the prompt signal (also known as the visible energy E vis ) is directly related to the neutrino energy:",

In the left panel of Fig. 15, the \u2206m 2 \u03c6 is plotted as a function of the visible energy E vis \u2261 E prompt as well as the baseline L. At a baseline L \u223c 60 km, \u2206m 2 \u03c6 has a clear energy dependence. In particular, the \u2206m 2 \u03c6 at low energy (2-4 MeV) is larger than that at high energy (4-8 MeV), providing an opportunity to determine MH. For the normal (inverted) MH, the \u2206m 2 ef f measured at low energy (2-4 MeV) would be higher (lower) than that measured at high energy (4-8 MeV). However, in order to perform such a measurement successfully, the energy resolution of the detector must be very good (better than 1.9% for \u03b4E/E at 2.5 MeV), since the oscillations corresponding to \u2206m 2 ef f are very fast at low energy and a cruder energy resolution would make the oscillation pattern to disappear. On the other hand, at short baseline (L < 20 km), \u2206m 2 \u03c6 is essentially a constant, thus it would be impossible to determine MH through comparing \u2206m 2 ef f values at low and high energy regions. The purple line in the left panel of Fig. 15 represents the approximate boundary of degenerate mass-squared difference. The right side of the purple line alone will yield negligible contributions to MH.",

Thus, the determination of MH represents the test of two discrete hypotheses (normal hierarchy vs. inverted hierarchy or NH vs. IH in short). In this context, there are two different but related questions: i) given the data from an experiment, how to quantify the finding regarding MH? and ii) when designing an experiment, how to evaluate its sensitivity to MH?  The usual approach to the first question is as follows. Given the result of a measurement, we compare the data (represented by \"x\") with expectations from both the NH and IH hypotheses. In practice, one commonly defines a test statistic T N H := \u22122 log L N H , where L N H is the likelihood of NH for data \"x\". T N H is further minimized over all nuisance parameters, including unknown parameters and systematic uncertainties, to obtain T min N H . Similarly, another test statistic T min IH is calculated from the likelihood of IH for data \"x\". In order to evaluate whether the experimental data favors NH or IH, a test statistics \u2206T = T min IH \u2212 T min N H is defined. It is easy to see that a positive \u2206T would favor the NH hypothesis, and a negative \u2206T would favor the IH hypothesis. In addition, the absolute size of \u2206T contains the information of how much data favor one hypothesis relative to the other one.",

Given a null hypothesis H 0 and the alternative hypothesis H 1 , type-I error rate \u03b1 is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis H 0 , if H 0 is true. On the other hand, type-II error rate \u03b2 is defined as the probability of accepting the null hypothesis H 0 , if H 1 is true. Furthermore, according to Neyman-Pearson lemma, the likelihood ratio test is shown to be the most powerful test given that H 0 and H 1 are both simple hypotheses. 4 This provides the basis to use \u2206T defined above to perform the MH hypothesis test. Before data are obtained, we choose the type-I error rate \u03b1, and this will decide the rule of the hypothesis test. The \u03b1 value will determine the rejection region, and it will in turn determine the corresponding type-II error rate \u03b2. In our MH problem, one can choose the null hypothesis to be NH, and the alternative hypothesis would be IH. The result of this test will tell us whether the NH would be rejected or not, given the pre-defined rule. Similarly, one should also perform a second hypothesis test by choosing null hypothesis to be IH with the alternative hypothesis being NH. The result of the second test will tell us whether the IH would be rejected or not. Unlike the Bayesian approach, the Frequentist approach does not directly address the question how much one MH hypothesis is favored over the other MH hypothesis given the experimental data.",

These next-generation experiments are in various stages of planning and funding.  The analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data from the Super-Kamiokande experiment currently provides a hint of the mass hierarchy. The Super-Kamiokande detector (left of Fig. 17) is a cylindrical 50-kton (22.5-kton fiducial volume) water Cherenkov detector located 1000 m underground in western Japan. The signal readout uses an array of regularly spaced large photo-multiplier tubes sensitive to single photo-electrons [88]. From the pattern of the detected Cherenkov light, one can reconstruct the energy, the direction, as well as the particle type of the charged leptons produced by the charged-current neutrino-nuclear interaction. Using the principle illustrated in Sec. 2.3, Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric neutrino data are sensitive to MH. Preliminary result was presented at Neutrino 2014 [87,89] and shown in the right panel of Fig. 17. The normal mass hierarchy is slightly favored by \u2206\u03c7 2 \u223c 0.9.

For the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy, the effective masssquared splitting in electron neutrino disappearance channel is larger (smaller) than that in the muon neutrino disappearance channel. In other word, the \u2206m 2 32 value extracted from these two channels would be more consistent with each other when testing the true MH hypothesis than the incorrect MH hypothesis. Figure 18 shows the extracted |\u2206m 2 32 | from Super Kamiokande [87] in Japan, IceCube [90] at the South Pole, T2K [91] in Japan, MINOS/MINOS+ [92] in the U.S., and Daya Bay [31,93] in China at the Neutrino 2014 conference under both normal and inverted MH scenarios. While Daya Bay measures the\u03bd e disappearance from reactors, the rest of experiments measure the \u03bd \u00b5 and/or\u03bd \u00b5 disappearance. Figure 18 shows that IH are slightly favored compared to NH. Assuming all results are uncorrelated, the fit of NH results yields a \u03c7 2 /N DF value of 4.4/4. On the other hand, the fit of IH results yield a \u03c7 2 /N DF value of 1.85/4. Therefore, the IH is favored by \u2206\u03c7 2 \u223c 2.55, which corresponds to a probability ratio of 78% vs. 22% in the Bayesian framework.",

            "text": "The NO\u03bdA (NuMI Off-axis \u03bd e Appearance) experiment [94] is an accelerator neutrino experiment in the United States. It is currently taking data. NO\u03bdA measures the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance as well as the \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) disappearance in a \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) beam. The neutrino beam is generated by the 120 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab's Main Injector. The system consists of two detectors, with the detector near the production point characterizing the neutrino beam and the far detector at the baseline of 810 km studying neutrino oscillations. Left panel of Fig. 19 shows the overall configuration of the NO\u03bdA experiment. The far detector is located at 14 mrad off-axis of the incident proton beam to obtain a narrow band neutrino beam around 2 GeV energy. The 810 km baseline corresponds to the maximal oscillation at 2 GeV. In addition, the long baseline offers the experiment a chance to determine the mass hierarchy through the matter effect as discussed in Sec. 2.2. Right panel of Fig. 19 shows the detector configuration of NO\u03bdA [95]. The near (0.3 kt) and far (14 kt) detectors are structurally and functionally identical, despite the difference in their absolute sizes. Such a configuration allows to minimize the systematic uncertainties in the neutrino beam, the neutrino interaction cross section, and the detecting efficiency. The near detector consists of 18 thousand PVC cells filled with liquid scintillator and arranged in alternating X/Y layers with an overall dimension of 14.3 \u00d7 4.2 \u00d7 4.2 m 3 . The light is transported through a wavelength shifting fiber and then read out with avalanche photodiode. The far detector is approximately 60 times larger with the overall dimension of 60 \u00d7 15.6 \u00d7 15.6 m 3 . Since it is located on the surface, the far detector is exposed to a large flux of cosmic muons. Nevertheless, a factor of 4\u00d710 7 suppression has been achieved to reject the cosmic ray background, taking into account the timing and the direction of the \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e beam. Figure 20 shows the expected MH sensitivity from NO\u03bdA after collecting a total of 36\u00d710 20 protons on target (POT), which corresponds to about six years (three years neutrino and three years antineutrino running) of data taking at 750 kW beam power. The mass hierarchy resolution has a large dependence on the value of the unknown CP phase \u03b4 CP . This is so because both the matter effect and the CP phase \u03b4 CP can induce differences between neutrino and antineutrino appearance oscillations, which leads to a degeneracy between the MH determination and the determination of CP phase \u03b4 CP for certain values of \u03b4 CP . At the most favorable CP values, the sensitivity of MH determination can reach about 3\u03c3. At this sensitivity, there is a 50% chance that NO\u03bdA will be able to reject the unfavored MH hypothesis by 3\u03c3. Meanwhile, 6.7% of measurements will yield a result favoring the wrong MH hypothesis. ",

            "text": "In this subsection the long baseline experiments that aim at the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy, among other things, are described. There were two proposals, the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) [97] in the US and the Large Apparatus for Grand Unification and Neutrino Astrophysics and Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillations (Laguna-LBNO or LBNO) [98] in Europe, designed to separate the signal of the two hierarchies with matter effect. While the fundamental goal of the two proposals is similar, they differ in important details, in particular in the length of the baseline. Due to the limited available resource and expected costs of these projects, LBNE and LBNO collaborations combined efforts and merged into a new experiment located in the US: the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (DUNE/LBNF). We concentrate on the DUNE experiment and will describe it in details. There is no firm schedule for DUNE at the present time. Tentatively, the construction of DUNE/LBNF might begin in 2017 and the neutrino beam might be ready by \u223c2023. DUNE is an accelerator neutrino experiment under development in the United States. It consists of a horn-produced broad band beam with 60-120 GeV protons at \u223c1 MW from Fermilab, >35 kton fiducial volume Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) 4850-feet underground at Sanford Laboratory in Lead, South Dakota, as the far detector, and high-resolution near detector(s) at Fermilab. Figure 21 shows the overall configuration of DUNE. In order to optimize the physics sensitivity to the CP phase \u03b4 CP , the baseline of DUNE is chosen to be 1300 km [99], which is longer than any existing accelerator neutrino experiments. The large underground LAr detector also represents an excellent opportunity for the underground science including proton decay searches, detection of atmospheric neutrinos and supernova neutrino burst. In particular, the detection of atmospheric neutrinos will provide additional information regarding MH.  Inverted Hierarchy Figure 22: The \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation probabilities are shown for the normal (left) and the inverted (right) mass hierarchies. Different curves represent different values of currently unknown CP phase \u03b4 CP . The first and second oscillation maxima locate at about 2.5 and 0.8 GeV, respectively. The matter density \u03c1 and the electron fraction Y e are assumed to be 2.7 g/cm 3 and 0.5, respectively. DUNE is designed to precisely measure parameters that govern \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ,\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 , and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd \u00b5 oscillations, including the second mixing angle \u03b8 23 , the third mixing angle \u03b8 13 , the CP phase \u03b4 CP , and MH. Figure 22 shows the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation probabilities for different values of \u03b4 CP for both normal and inverted mass hierarchies. The principle of the MH determination in DUNE relies on the matter effect, introduced in Sec. 2.2. For NH, the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance probability at first oscillation maximum (\u223c2.5 GeV) is enhanced (suppressed), while for IH, the opposite is true, i.e., the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance probability at first oscillation maximum is suppressed (enhanced). At 1300 km, the matter effect in DUNE is large enough so that there is no fundamental degeneracy between the matter effect and the \u03b4 CP -induced CP effect. In other word, given enough statistics, these two effects can be totally disentangled. Furthermore, the precision measurements of the oscillation probability will also enable a measurement of the currently unknown CP phase \u03b4 CP that may hold the key to explain the large matter over anti-matter asymmetry in our universe [101].

Rubbia for the neutrino physics [103] in 1977. As the most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere (\u223c1.3% by weight), argon can be extracted economically, and is an ideal material for the TPC. Electrons have very high mobility in LAr [104]. At 500 V/cm electric field and 87 K temperature, the electron drift velocity is about 1.6 km/s [105,106,107,108], which is equivalent to about 0.64 ms for electrons to travel 1 m. Electrons have low diffusions in LAr [109]; the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients are about 5 and 13 cm 2 /s [110,111,112,113], respectively at 500 V/cm electric field. For a 1.6 ms drift time, these numbers correspond to a position resolution (one standard deviation) of about 1.3 and 2.0 mm for longitudinal and transverse diffusions, respectively. LAr also has relatively high density (\u223c1.4 g/mL at 87K), advantageous for neutrino experiments.",

The scintillation light (emission peaks at \u223c128 nm [114]) can provide the absolute event time to determine the drift distance along the electric field direction. The coordinate information perpendicular to the electron drift direction can be determined with a high resolution detector (e.g. wire planes). The spatial resolution could reach a few mm. Finally, the ionization energy required to produce an electron-ion pair is about 23.6 eV [104,115]. Some of the pairs will recombine in LAr, and the remaining electrons will be collected at wire planes. The charge collected per wire will be closely related to the energy deposition per unit distance (dE/dx), which can be used for the particle identification (PID). In addition, the event topology can be used for PID as well. LArTPCs are excellent detectors of neutrino interactions. Fig. 23 shows event displays for two neutrino events from Monte Carlo as an example. The high-resolution nature of LArTPC is self-evident.

Furthermore, the precise measurement of these hadrons produced in the neutral-and charged-current interactions will significantly improve the background estimation in the oscillation signal.

This appears to be an insurmountable problem. However, the differences in the cross section and kinematics of the \u03bd and\u03bd interaction with nuclei, as well as the differences in the atmospheric \u03bd and \u03bd fluxes, makes it possible to separate the two hierarchies. As described in Ref. [120], it is possible to identify the \"distinguishability\" region in the space of E \u03bd and cos \u03b8 zenith where the effect of MH is most pronounced. It is these regions where the most useful information of the MH can be extracted.",

            "text": "The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) [123, 124] is a planned underground experiment at Pottipuram, Theni (India) to study the atmospheric neutrinos. The project has been approved by the Indian government with the tentative start of data taking by 2020. The proposed detector is a magnetized iron calorimeter with 52 kiloton mass and 1.5 Tesla magnetic field, divided into three detector modules. Each module contains 151 layers of 5.6 cm iron plates with the resistive plate chambers (RPC) as active detector elements in the gaps between the plates. INO will have excellent muon energy and direction resolutions as well as a charge reconstruction capability. Besides MH, INO will be also sensitive to \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 32 . Fig. 28 shows the projected MH sensitivity of INO vs. data taking time [125]. An improved analysis taking into account the hadron energy reconstruction together with all oscillation parameters marginalized, show an enhanced sensitivity [126]. The \u2206T is expected to reach 9.5 with 10 years of data taking for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.1 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.5 [126]. Note that the MH sensitivity strongly depends on the true values of \u03b8 23 and \u03b8 13 which, however, might be precisely known by the time the detector begins data taking. The MH sensitivity is significantly larger if the mixing angle \u03b8 23 is in the second octant, i.e. if sin 2 \u03b8 23 > 0.5. The same also applies to MH sensitivity in PINGU.  Hyper-Kamiokande [127] is a proposed experiment near the site of the previous Kamiokande and the current Super-Kamiokande detectors in Japan. The master plan at present suggests that the construction and the operation might begin in 2018 and 2025, respectively. The detector technology will be water Cherenkov similar as in Super-Kamiokande, only many times larger, with a total mass of 1 Megatons (560 kiloton fiducial mass). While the main experimental program at Hyper-Kamiokande is the precision measurement of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e and\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e oscillations with accelerator neutrinos at a relative short baseline (295 km) to search for CP violation in the lepton sector, Hyper Kamiokande is also sensitive to MH with atmospheric neutrinos. Fig. 29 shows the atmospheric neutrino MH sensitivity with ten years of data taking. Again, the MH sensitivity is significantly larger if the mixing angle \u03b8 23 happens to be in the second octant. ",

Figure 31 shows a conceptual design of the spherical LS central detector. The photo-cathode coverage is expected to reach 75%. Together with high performance LS (high photon yield with >14,000 photons per MeV, optical attenuation length of 30 m or better) and high quantum efficiency PMTs (peak quantum efficiency reaching 35%), JUNO aims to achieve an energy resolution of better than 1.9% at 2.5 MeV, which is essential for the MH determination. This level of energy resolution requires a comprehensive calibration system to minimize position dependent corrections to the reconstructed energy. The spherical central detector will be placed inside a water pool instrumented with PMTs to identify and veto cosmic muons and provide shielding from radioactive backgrounds in the underground environment. A muon tracker on top of the detector will further enhance the muon identification.  RENO-50 is a proposed large (18 kton) liquid scintillator detector in Korea [130]. At the present time, the schedule for the facility and detector construction aims at years 2015-2020 with the start of operation in 2021. The central detector is expected to be equipped with 15k high quantum efficiency 20inch PMTs. Fig. 32 shows the proposed site of RENO-50, roughly 50 km away from the Hanbit nuclear power plant. The physics goal of RENO-50 is similar to those of JUNO, including the determination of MH and the precision measurements of neutrino mixings. In order to reach the desired energy resolution for MH determination, RENO-50 is carrying out R&D to i) enhance the light yield of liquid scintillator from \u223c 500 to > 1000 photoelectrons/MeV, ii) increase the attenuation length of the liquid scinillator from \u223c 15 to \u223c25 m, and iii) enhance the quantum efficiency of PMT from 20% to 35%.

The motivations and the theoretical framework are depicted in Sec. 1. Then, in Sec. 2 the practical methods that can be used in the MH determination are described. Finally, in Sec. 3 the various existing and proposed or planned experiments that have the capacity to shed light on the MH are briefly reviewed. Determining the neutrino mass hierarchy is a challenging problem. Even though one could naively expect that the difference between the normal and inverted hierarchies, the two possible mass ordering shown in Fig. 1, is going to be significant, in fact the difference is rather subtle in the real data. That is so because the majority of experimental findings, at least for the most common case of neutrinos propagating in vacuum, can be described in a reasonable approximation as stemming from mixing of just two neutrino states; in that case the oscillation pattern depends only on the absolute values of the mass-squared differences, not on their sign. Thus, in order to determine the MH, i.e. the sign of \u2206m 2 3x , it is necessary to go beyond that approximation and consider the effects associated with mixing of the three neutrino states. The corresponding effects are, however, suppressed by the two small parameters present in the oscillation formalism, the mixing angle \u03b8 13 \u223c 8.5 o and the mass square difference ratio \u2206m 2 21 /\u2206m 2 32 \u223c 1/30. The fact that it is possible to approach the problem in this way at all is the result of successful experiments that have recently shown that the mixing angle \u03b8 13 is not as small as many people believed. That finding opens the way to the MH determination. At the same time, that finding also shows that the seemingly simple and attractive possibility of the so-called tribimaximal mixing matrix, originally suggested in Ref. [134] and discussed in many papers since, is not realized in nature. Even though the PMNS matrix, as determined from the oscillation experiments, looks similar to the simple form suggested, with |U ij | 2 expressed in rational numbers 2/3,1/2, 1/3,1/6 and 0, the reality is more complicated.",

Solar neutrinos propagate from the central region of the Sun, over large distance with high electron density, so the matter effects are very pronounced. However, the corresponding oscillation length L matter to determine the mass ordering of neutrinos \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 (see Eq.
