The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) partonic distribution (PDF) and fragmentation functions (FF) play a crucial role in gathering and interpreting information towards a true 3-dimensional imaging of the nucleons. TMDs can be accessed in several experiments, but the main source of information is semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) of polarized leptons off polarized nucleon. For SIDIS, the theoretical formalism is described in a series of papers [1,2] using tree level factorization [3] where the standard momentum convolution integral [4] relates the quark intrinsic transverse momentum to the transverse momentum of the produced hadron P hT in semi-inclusive processes.",

In the MC generator we used the model described in Ref. [1] that was numerically further evolved in Ref. [2]. The Bessel-weighted asymmetry, providing access to the ratio of Fourier transforms of g 1 and f 1 , has been extracted.

For our studies we used simple factorized Gaussians for the f 1 (x, k \u22a5 ) and g 1 (x, k \u22a5 ) distribution functions and D 1 fragmentation function, with widths given by fits from available world data. Figure 1 shows the two dimensional plot of k 2 \u22a5 /Q 2 versus x. One can see a clear correlation between the transverse and longitudinal momenta, where the dashed black curves [2] defining the upper bounds. Restrictions at large x come from the energy and momentum conservation and at small x from the requirement that the parton should move in the forward direction with respect to the parent hadron (k z > 0). The red curves (solid for Q 2 = 1 GeV 2 and dashed Q 2 = 3 GeV 2 ) are calculated for a non-zero proton mass, requiring the parton to move in the forward direction with respect to the parent hadron (in Ref. [2] the proton mass was neglected).",

Within the b T range of b T < 5 \u223c 6 GeV \u22121 1 f m the Bessel-weighted asymmetries could be extracted with a minimum of 2.5% accuracy, although with some systematic shift. The shift observed in the reconstructed value is due to the kinematical restriction introduced by energy and momentum conservation [2], which deforms the Gaussian shapes of the k \u22a5 and p \u22a5 distributions. In experiment there is always a cutoff at high P hT due to the acceptance and low cross section, as well as a cutoff at small P hT , where the azimuthal angles are not well defined. A correction factor, accounting for the missing P hT range above the maximum value accessible (P max ) in a given experiment, was estimated, based on an analytic calculation of the contribution above that value. The systematic uncertainty of that correction could be estimated from the variation of the maximum P max within the resolution of the experiment. In Fig. 2 the blue filled squares represent this correction using the Gaussian distributions and the open black squares represent the numerical integration up to that exact k 2 max that we used for correction.
