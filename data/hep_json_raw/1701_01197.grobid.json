The normalized magnetic-quadrupole (M2) amplitude for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8 and the normalized electric-octupole (E3) amplitudes for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c2, \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 are determined. The M2 amplitudes for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c1 and \u03c7c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 are found to differ significantly from zero and are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also obtain the ratios of M2 contributions of \u03c8(3686) and J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c7c1,2, b 1 2 /b 2 2 = 1.35 \u00b1 0.72 and a 1 2 /a 2 2 = 0.617 \u00b1 0.083, which agree well with theoretical expectations. By considering the multipole contributions of \u03c7c1,2, we measure the product branching fractions for the cascade decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c0,1,2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8 and search for the process \u03b7c(2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 through \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c(2S). The product branching fraction for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8 is 3\u03c3 larger than published measurements, while those of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8 are consistent. No significant signal for the decay \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8 is observed, and the upper limit of the product branching fraction at the 90% confidence level is determined.",

The contributions of these higher multipole amplitudes give information on the anomalous magnetic moment \u03ba of the charm quark [1,2] and on the admixture of S-and D-wave states [3]. The normalized M2 contributions for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3 1 \u03c7 c1,2 and \u03c7 c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3 2 J/\u03c8, which are referred to as b 1,2 2 and a 1,2 2 with the superscript representing \u03c7 c1,2 , are predicted to be related to the mass of the charm quark, m c , and \u03ba [1,2,4].

Higher-order multipole amplitudes can be obtained by investigating the angular distributions of the final-state particles [1,6,7]. Several experiments have searched for higher-order multipole amplitudes [5,[8][9][10][11][12]. The CLEO experiment reported significant M2 contributions in \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3 1 \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3 2 J/\u03c8 by analyzing 24 million \u03c8(3686) decays [5]. Recently, BESIII found evidence for the M2 contribution in \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 with \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 /K + K \u2212 [12].",

These requirements suppress 77% of the Bhabha events with a reduction of the signal efficiency by one third. The corresponding MC-determined efficiencies are listed in Table II.

To remove the peaking background, such as radiative Bhabha and radiative di-muon (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR/FSR \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), a threeconstraint (3C) kinematic fit is applied, in which the energy of the soft photon (\u03b3 1 ) is left free in the fit.

For the background from radiative Bhabha/di-muon processes, the ratio N \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 /N \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 is obtained by a fit to a 928 pb \u22121 data sample taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. After the event selection imposed on the data, the remaining events are mainly radiative Bhabha/di-muon events, and a small contribution originates from \u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ and decays of \u03c8(3686) produced in ISR process. In the fit, the shapes of the M 3C (\u03b3 2 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) distributions for the Bhabha/di-muon processes are determined from a \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 FSR (\u03b3 FSR ) MC sample by shifting the M 3C (\u03b3 2 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) from \u03c8(3686) to \u03c8(3770) according to formula m \u2032 = a * (m \u2212 m 0 ) + m 0 , where m 0 = 3.097 GeV/c 2 is the mass threshold of \u03b3J/\u03c8, and the coefficient a = (3.773 \u2212 m 0 )/(3.686 \u2212 m 0 ) = 1.15 shifts the events from 3.686 GeV to 3.773 GeV. The shapes of the backgrounds are based on MC simulation, while the amplitude of each component is set as a free parameter. Thus, the cross-section weighted ratio of the backgrounds e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 ISR/FSR (\u03b3 ISR/FSR ) and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03b3 FSR (\u03b3 FSR ) for the two parts is N e + e \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 /N e + e \u2212 \u03b3 = 1.203 \u00b1 0.081 (N \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 /N \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0.689 \u00b1 0.044) for the e + e \u2212 TABLE I.

The \u03c1 J a 2,3 b 2,3 are the correlation coefficients between a J 2,3 and b J 2,3 . \u03c7c1 a 1 2 = \u22120.0740 \u00b1 0.0033 \u00b1 0.0034, b 1 2 = 0.0229 \u00b1 0.0039 \u00b1 0.0027 \u03c1   Figure 3 shows the M 3C (\u03b3 2 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) distributions for selected candidates of the two channels of J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , where clear signals of \u03c7 c0,1,2 can be observed. No evident \u03b7 c (2S) signature is found. A simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to obtain the signal yields. The common parameter for the two J/\u03c8 decay channels is the product branching fraction (B product ) of the cascade decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,1,2 (\u03b7 c (2S)) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8. The number of signal events for each channel is N \u03c8(3686) \u00d7 B product \u00d7 B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) \u00d7 \u01eb. In the fit, the branching fractions for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 /\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and the total number of \u03c8(3686) events are fixed to the values in Ref. [17] and Ref. [25], respectively. The efficiency \u01eb is obtained from the signal MC sample with the higher-order multipole amplitudes considered as listed in Table II. The fit contains three \u03c7 c0,1,2 components, the \u03b7 c (2S), and the background. The signal lineshapes of the \u03c7 c0,1,2 are parameterized as",

In Fig. 5, the product branching fractions are compared to previous results from BESIII [24], CLEO [41], and the world average [17]. The world average refers to product of the average branching fraction of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3 1 \u03c7 cJ and the average branching fraction of \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3 2 J/\u03c8, where the results of BESIII and CLEO are not included in the world average values. For all \u03c7 cJ , our results exceed the precision of the previous measurements. Compared to the previous BESIII result, the results are consistent within 1\u03c3, but we have considered the higherorder multipole amplitudes and improved the systematic uncertainty due to a more precise measurement of the total number of produced \u03c8(3686) [25]. In addition, our measurement for the \u03c7 c0 channel is 3\u03c3 larger than the result from CLEO and 3\u03c3 larger than the world average value, while for the \u03c7 c1,2 , our results are consistent with previous measurements. There are theoretical prediction for the branching fraction \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,1,2 by several different models [14][15][16] without consideration of higherorder multipole amplitudes, which agree with each other poorly. The results in this measurement will provide a guidance for the theoretical calculations.",

Considering the systematic uncertainty, an upper limit on the product branching fraction is determined to be B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S)) \u00d7 B(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8) < 9.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at the 90% C.L., where the systematic uncertainty is incorporated by a factor 1/(1\u2212\u03c3 syst. ) for conservative. Combining the result of B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S)) obtained by BESIII [42], the upper limit of the branching fraction for \u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 is B(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8) < 0.044 at the 90% C.L. Using the width of \u03b7 c (2S) of 11.3 +3.2 \u22122.9 MeV/c 2 [17], our upper limit implies a partial width of \u0393(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8) < 0.50 MeV/c 2 . Although this result agrees with the prediction of LQCD (0.0013 MeV/c 2 ) [23], it clearly has a very limited sensitivity to rigorously test theory.
