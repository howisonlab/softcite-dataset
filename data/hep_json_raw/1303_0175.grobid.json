After subtracting the known background sources, the inclusive muon charge asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero while the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry significantly deviates from the standard model (SM) prediction. This deviation is usually interpreted as the anomalous charge asymmetry of B 0 and B 0 s semileptonic decays [5,6].",

The composition of the like-sign dimuon sample can be derived from the information given in Table I assuming that the two muons come from independent processes. This assumption can be applied because the requirement that the invariant mass of the two like-sign muons is greater than 2.8 GeV, which is used for selecting the dimuon pairs [4], suppresses decays with the two muons originating from the same b quark. Since the oscillation of the D 0 meson is found to be small [8], the contribution of process T 6 in Table I to the like-sign dimuon sample is suppressed and, therefore, is neglected in the following discussion.",

The experimental uncertainty on \u2206\u0393 d keeps open the possibility of a substantially larger contribution from this source. We also note that CPV in interference of B 0 is much larger than the SM prediction for CPV in mixing of B 0 and B 0 s given in Eq. (26). In Ref. [4] the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry is measured in several sub-samples of events with an additional selection according to the muon impact parameter. This selection effectively changes the contribution of muons coming from the oscillated B 0 decays. The estimate (55) after applying this selection is also modified and the contribution from CPV in interference can be enhanced by selecting the dimuon events with large muon impact parameter. Therefore, the study of the dependence of the asymmetry A S on the muon impact parameter can provide an additional insight on this source of CPV. Estimate 2.
