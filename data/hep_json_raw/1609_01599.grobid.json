The analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The inclusive cross sections are extracted using likelihood fits to signal and control regions, resulting in \u03c3 tt Z = 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 pb and \u03c3 tt W = 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 pb, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), top quarks are copiously produced in quark-antiquark pairs (tt). This process has been extensively studied in proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV, and recently at 13 TeV [1,2] centre-of-mass energy. Measurements of the associated production of tt with a Z boson (tt Z) allow the extraction of information about the neutral-current coupling of the top quark. The production rate of a top-quark pair with a massive vector boson could be altered in the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as vector-like quarks [3,4], strongly coupled Higgs bosons [5] or technicolour [6][7][8][9][10], and therefore the measurements of \u03c3 tt Z and \u03c3 tt W are important checks of the validity of the SM at this new energy regime. The tt Z and tt W processes have been established by ATLAS [11] and CMS [12] using the Run-1 dataset at \u221a s = 8 TeV, with measured cross sections compatible with the SM prediction and having uncertainties of \u223c30%. At \u221a s = 13 TeV, the SM cross sections of the tt Z and tt W processes increase by factors of 3.5 and 2.4, respectively, compared to \u221a s = 8 TeV. The cross sections, computed at next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD precision, using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (referred e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch to in the following as MG5_aMC), are \u03c3 tt Z = 0.84 pb and \u03c3 ttW = 0.60 pb with an uncertainty of \u223c12% [13,14], primarily due to higher-order corrections, estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales.",

The final states of top-quark pairs produced in association with a Z or a W boson comprise up to four isolated, prompt leptons. 1 Decay modes with two same-sign (SS) charged muons, or three or four leptons are considered in this analysis. The analysis strategy follows the strategy adopted for the 8 TeV dataset [11], excluding the lower sensitivity SS dilepton channels. Table 1 lists the analysis channels and the targeted decay modes of the tt Z and tt W processes. Each channel is divided into multiple analysis regions in order to enhance the sensitivity to the signal. Simultaneous fits are performed to the signal regions and selected control regions in order to extract the cross sections for tt Z and tt W production. Additional validation regions are defined to check that the background estimate agrees with the data and are not used in the fit.",

The inner detector (ID) consists of a high-granularity silicon pixel detector, including the newly installed Insertable B-Layer [16], which is the innermost layer of the tracking system, and a silicon microstrip tracker, together providing pre- Tetralepton cision tracking in the pseudorapidity 2 range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and of a transition radiation tracker covering |\u03b7| < 2.0. All the systems are immersed in a 2 T magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. The EM sampling calorimeter uses lead and liquid argon (LAr) and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and endcap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. Hadron calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures, in the range |\u03b7| < 1.7, and by two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters that cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, optimised for EM and hadronic measurements respectively, covering the region 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muon tracks in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers located in toroidal magnetic fields. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm for most of the detector. The muon spectrometer is also instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system, using custom hardware followed by a software-based trigger level, is used to reduce the event rate to an average of around 1 kHz for offline storage.",

A simultaneous variation of \u03bc R = \u03bc F by factors 2.0 and 0.5 is performed. In addition, the effects of a set of variations in the tune parameters (A14 eigentune variations), sensitive to initial-and final-state radiation, multiple parton interactions and colour reconnection, are evaluated. Studies performed at particle level show that the largest impact comes from variations in initial-state radiation [26].

The uncertainty due to the matrix method is estimated by propagating the statistical uncertainty on the measurement of the fake-lepton efficiencies. Additionally, a 20% uncertainty is added to the subtracted charge-flip yields estimated as the difference between data-driven charge-flips and simulation, and the E miss T requirement used to enhance the single-fake-lepton fraction is varied by 20 GeV. The main sources of fake muons are decays of light-flavour or heavyflavour hadrons inside jets. For the 2\u03bc-SS region, the flavour composition of the jets faking leptons is assumed to be unknown. To cover this uncertainty, the central values of the fake-lepton efficiencies extracted from the b-veto and the b-tag control regions are used, with the efficiency difference assigned as an extra uncertainty. For the tetralepton channel, fake-lepton systematic uncertainties are covered by the scale-factor uncertainties used to calibrate the simulated fake-lepton yield in the control regions. Within a fake-lepton estimation method, all systematic uncertainties are considered to be correlated among analysis channels and regions. Thus 2\u03bc-SS and trilepton fake-lepton systematic uncertainties that use the matrix method are not correlated with the tetralepton systematic uncertainties.

In the two channels most sensitive to the tt W signal the observed relative number of events with two positively or two negatively charged leptons is compatible with expectation. In the 3 -noZ-2b channel the observed distribution of the number of events with a given amount of electrons and muons match expectation, as well.  Fig. 8 The result of the simultaneous fit to the tt Z and tt W cross sections along with the 68 and 95% confidence level (CL) contours. The shaded areas correspond to the theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model predictions, and include renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties as well as PDF uncertainties including \u03b1 S variations uncertainties for tt Z (tt W ), the cross section for tt W (tt Z) is fixed to its Standard Model value. For both processes, the precision of the measurement is dominated by statistical uncertainties. For the tt Z determination, the different sources contribute with similar size to the total systematic uncertainty. For the tt W determination, the dominant systematic uncertainty source is the limited amount of data available for the estimation of the fake leptons.",

The significance of the transverse impact parameter d 0 is required to satisfy |d 0 |/\u03c3 (d 0 ) < 5 for electrons and |d 0 |/\u03c3 (d 0 ) < 3 for muons, where \u03c3 (d 0 ) is the uncertainty in d 0 . Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [51,52] with radius parameter R = 0.4, starting from topological clusters in the calorimeters [53]. The effect of pile-up on jet energies is accounted for by a jet-area-based correction [54] and the energy resolution of the jets is improved by using global sequential corrections [55]. Jets are calibrated to the hadronic energy scale using E-and \u03b7-dependent calibration factors based on MC simulations, with in-situ corrections based on Run-1 data [56,57] and checked with early Run-2 data [58]. Jets are accepted if they fulfil the requirements p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To reduce the contribution from jets associated with pile-up, jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are required to satisfy pile-up rejection criteria (JVT), based on a multivariate combination of track-based variables [59]. Jets are b-tagged as likely to contain b-hadrons using the MV2c20 algorithm, a multivariate discriminant making use of the long lifetime, large decay multiplicity, hard fragmentation and high mass of b-hadrons [60]. The average efficiency to correctly tag a b-jet is approximately 77%, as determined in simulated tt events, but it varies as a function of p T and \u03b7. In simulation, the tagging algorithm gives a rejection factor of about 130 against light-quark and gluon jets, and about 4.5 against jets containing charm quarks [61]. The efficiency of b-tagging in simulation is corrected to that in data using a tt-based calibration using Run-1 data [62] and validated with Run-2 data [63].",
