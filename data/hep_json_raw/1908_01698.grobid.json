In particular, the potential precision of the Z lineshape determination calls for a very precise measurement of the absolute luminosity, at the level of 10 \u22124 , and the precision on the relative luminosity between energy scan points around the Z pole should be an order of magnitude better. The luminosity is principally determined from the rate of low-angle Bhabha interactions, e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , where the final state electrons and positrons are detected in dedicated calorimeters covering small angles from the outgoing beam directions. Electromagnetic effects caused by the very large charge density of the beam bunches affect the effective acceptance of these luminometers in a nontrivial way. If not corrected for, these effects would lead, at the Z pole, to a systematic bias of the measured luminosity that is more than one order of magnitude larger than the desired precision. In this note, these effects are studied in detail, and methods to measure and correct for them are proposed.",

The e + e \u2212 collider and the experimental programme are described in the FCC-ee Conceptual Design Report (CDR) [2]. Several stages are foreseen, during which the collider is planned to run at and around the Z pole, at the WW threshold, at the ZH cross-section maximum, and at and above the tt threshold. The machine delivers extremely high luminosities, in particular at the Z pole where a luminosity of 2.3 \u00d7 10 36 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is expected per interaction point. To optimally exploit the very large anticipated data samples, a relative precision of 10 \u22124 on the absolute measurement of the luminosity is desirable [2], a factor of three better than the experimental uncertainty of the most precise measurement achieved at LEP [3]. Moreover, the ratio of the luminosities measured at different energy points around the Z pole must be known to within a few 10 \u22125 (so called \"point-to-point uncertainty\").

Electrons (positrons) in the e \u2212 (e + ) bunch feel the field from the counter-rotating e + (e \u2212 ) bunch, responsible in particular for the well-known beamstrahlung radiation. Moreover, any charged particle present in the final state of an e + e \u2212 interaction, if emitted at a small angle with respect to the beam direction, also feels the fields of the bunches. In particular, the final state e + (e \u2212 ) in a Bhabha interaction, emitted at a small angle from the e + (e \u2212 ) beam direction, feels an attractive force from the incoming e \u2212 (e + ) bunch, and is consequently focused towards the beam axis. 2 This effect, illustrated in figure 1 in the case of head-on collisions, leads to an effective reduction of the LumiCal acceptance, as particles that would otherwise hit the detector close to its inner edge are focused to lower polar angles and, therefore, miss the detector. As explained below, at the Z pole, the resulting bias on the Bhabha counting rate is of the order of two per mil, a factor of 20 larger than the goal on the precision of the measurement. Consequently, this bias must be corrected for, and it must be known to better than 5% for this correction to contribute less than 10 \u22124 to the systematic uncertainty on the luminosity measurement.",

As shown in section 3, a nonzero collision crossing angle has important consequences on the beam-induced effects considered in this note. Dedicated simulation tools, such as the Guinea-Pig code [6] used here, allow these effects to be computed numerically. The correction of the bias on the luminosity could, in principle, be taken from such simulations. However, as is shown below, the correction factor depends significantly on the parameters that characterise the bunches, which may vary from bunch to bunch and during the fills, such that a numerical determination of the correction assuming averaged values for these parameters could be affected by a significant systematic uncertainty. Moreover, since these beam-induced effects on the luminosity measurement have not been observed yet, experimental crosscheck measurements of the calculations are highly desirable. In this note, measurements are proposed to determine the luminosity correction factor with a reduced dependence on the simulation.",

The colliding electron and positron beams cross with an angle \u03b1 = 30 mrad at two interaction points (IP). A detector is placed at each IP, with a solenoid that delivers a magnetic field of 2 T parallel to the bisector of the two beam axes, called the z axis. The two beam directions define the (x, z) horizontal plane. The convention used here is such that the velocity of both beams along the x axis is negative, the x axis pointing towards the centre of the collider ring. Two complementary central detector designs are under study. In both cases, the trajectories of charged particles are measured within a tracker down to polar angles of about 150 mrad with respect to the z axis. The tracker is surrounded by a calorimeter and a muon detection system. The region covering polar angles below 100 mrad corresponds to the \"machine-detector interface\" (MDI), the design of which demands special care. A brief account of the MDI can be found in ref. [7]. The luminosity is measured from the rate of small angle Bhabha interactions, benefiting from the large cross-section of the Bhabha scattering process in the forward region (proportional to 1/\u03b8 3 , where \u03b8 denotes the polar angle of the scattered e \u00b1 with respect to the outgoing e \u00b1 beam direction). The Bhabha electrons are detected in a dedicated luminometer system, which consists of two calorimeters, one on each side of the interac- tion point. The space where these calorimeters can be installed is very tightly constrained. Indeed, in order to reach the aforementioned luminosity, the last focusing quadrupole must be very close to the IP, well within the detector volume. Moreover, as there is a 15 mrad angle between the momentum of the beam particles and the field of the main detector, a compensating solenoid is required in order to avoid a large blow-up of the beam emittance. In the baseline configuration [2], the front face of this compensating solenoid is at 1.2 m from the IP, which basically sets the position of the end face of the LumiCal. The LumiCal that detects e \u2212 (e + ) is centred along the direction of the outgoing e \u2212 (e + ) beam, extends along this direction between z LumiCal = 1.074 m and 1.190 m, and covers an inner (outer) radius of 54 mm (145 mm). For a robust energy measurement, the fiducial acceptance limits are kept away from the borders of the instrumented area, effectively reducing the acceptance to the 62-88 mrad range.",

An input Bhabha event is associated to one of the e + e \u2212 interactions, i.e. is assigned a spatial vertex and an interaction time according to their probability density. Beamstrahlung, that causes the energy of the initial state particles to be reduced, as well as the electromagnetic deflection of these particles due to the field of the opposite bunch, are taken into account by rescaling, boosting and rotating the generated Bhabha event [5]. The electron and positron that come out from this Bhabha interaction see their four-momenta corrected when these transformations are applied.

This dependence is a consequence of the JHEP10(2019)225 crossing angle, as depicted in figure 7: a lepton emitted towards the inside of the ring, corresponding to \u03c6 = 0, travels for quite some time in the vicinity of the opposite charge bunch, and feels a stronger focusing force than a lepton emitted on the other side towards \u03c6 = \u03c0, which is further away from the opposite charge bunch.

The left panel of figure 8 shows the Guinea-Pig prediction for the angular focusing of 45.6 GeV electrons emitted at \u03b8 * = 64 mrad, when the number of longitudinal slices is increased from 30 to 800, the other settings being identical to the default settings given in section 3.1.1. The convergence is seen to be reached with about 700 slices, which corresponds to a slice length of about 20% of the standard deviation \u03a3 z of the z vtx distribution (eq. corresponding to the nominal interaction point. The deflection is obtained by integrating the Lorentz force felt by the electron between t = 0 and a time t max shown on the x axis, expressed in units of \u03c3 s /c. It can be seen that the deflection angle quickly reaches its plateau value \u2206\u03b8 FS , at a time of about 0.7\u03c3 s /c, irrespective of the azimuthal angle of the electron. This means that the deflection of Bhabha electrons from the field of the opposite charge bunch remains a rather localised effect. In particular, when the electron is emitted in the (x, z) plane, hence at 49 mrad (79 mrad) with respect to the z axis for \u03c6 = 0 (\u03c6 = \u03c0), it has travelled a distance of 0.4 mm (0.7 mm) along the x direction at t = 0.7\u03c3 s /c. Consequently, when Guinea-Pig is used to determine \u2206\u03b8 FS , the knowledge of the fields within the \"first\" grid, set to extend up to 150\u03c3 x 1 mm along the x direction, is sufficient for an accurate determination of the deflection angle. When the electron is emitted in the (y, z) plane, at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, it reaches y = 0.5 mm at t = 0.7\u03c3 s /c. This distance is very large compared to the dimension along y of the first grid, set to 60\u03c3 y 2 \u00b5m. However, as can be seen in figure 6 (left), the approximation made when Guinea-Pig is run with one single grid, whereby the fields outside the grid are taken to be those expected from a linear charge distribution, remains reasonable also in that extreme case, as the Guinea-Pig prediction agrees within less than 10% with the numerical calculation. This agreement justifies the choice of the default Guinea-Pig settings used for this study.",

(3.2) for the latter), once the p x kick and the final state angular focusing \u2206\u03b8 FS (\u03b8, \u03c6) are known, either from the Guinea-Pig simulation or from the numerical calculation described in section 3.1.2. A sample of 7 millions of \"genuine\" Bhabha events, generated with the BHWIDE Monte-Carlo program, are also used in sections 3.4 and 5 to determine the luminosity bias. Photon radiation (included in BHWIDE) leads to softer electrons in the final state, which feel a stronger focusing (figure 5 right). For final state radiations, however, the photon is usually emitted at a small angle with respect to the final state electron. The clustering algorithm that will be used to reconstruct the electrons in the LumiCal is likely to merge the electron and the (non deflected) radiated photon into a single cluster, thereby compensating for the latter effect. Hence, a proper study of the effect of radiations requires the BHWIDE events to be processed through a full simulation of the LumiCal and a cluster reconstruction algorithm to be run on the simulated energy deposits. Such a full simulation study, on a large statistics sample, is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, the luminosity bias (and the observable described in section 5) obtained from BHWIDE events are also shown below, as obtained using the final state charged leptons, applying a loose lower energy cut of 5 GeV on the latter, and ignoring the effects of the LumiCal clustering. The true values of the bias and of the observable are expected to lie between this latter determination and the prediction corresponding to leading-order Bhabha events.",

The idea of making measurements during this period and of extrapolating them to the situation where beam-beam effects would be absent has been proposed in ref. [15] and applied to the measurement of the crossing angle increase induced by the p x kick (section 4). The same idea is exploited here. During this period, half of the nominal intensity is first injected in electron and positron bunches, which are then alternatively topped up by steps of 10%, until the nominal intensity is reached for both. The bunches collide during this filling period, with the nominal optic parameters, and their longitudinal lengths vary between \u223c 0.65\u03c3 s and \u223c 1.10\u03c3 s [15]. The orbit may slightly differ from the nominal collision orbit, with a nonvanishing relative offset of the beams at the IP or a non-vanishing crossing angle in the vertical plane, but the Acol variable is largely insensitive to such variations (figure 12). Moreover, potential relative displacements of the beam spot between the ramp-up steps can be monitored precisely using tracks reconstructed in the tracker, such that a potential difference in Acol misalign between these steps can be corrected for.",

The result of a linear fit is also shown, from which it can be seen that the slope Acol beam could be determined with a statistical  uncertainty of 1.7%. This error would be reduced to less than 1% by using, instead of the intensities and bunch lengths provided by the beam monitoring, the number of dimuon events and the energy spread measured in-situ with a very good precision [15]. The uncertainty due to the \u03c3 s dependence of Acol is assessed by setting an uncertainty of \u00b10.03 for a (which is conservative for the range of \u03c3 s considered here). It results in a systematic uncertainty of 2% on the fitted slope, well within the level of precision that is targeted for. Moreover, as long as the experimental resolution on the polar angle measurement dominates the spread of the \u2206\u03b8 +\u2212 distributions, the statistical uncertainty of 1.7% on the luminosity correction factor, resulting from a fit to the Acol measurements, is independent of the misalignment.",

            "text": "Electromagnetic effects caused by the very large charge densities of the FCC-ee beam bunches affect the colliding particles in several related ways. The final state electrons and positrons from small angle Bhabha scattering are focused by the electromagnetic fields of the counter-rotating bunches leading to a sizeable bias of the luminometer acceptance, that must be corrected for in order to reach the desired precision on the luminosity measurement. Several sets of measurements can be used to control this bias. The crossing angle increase from its nominal value that is induced by beam-beam effects, which is measured using the central detector, and an acollinearity variable that is measured using the luminometer system, provide a determination of the correction factor to be applied to the luminosity. For the latter measurement, the effects induced by the beams can be disentangled from those caused by a misalignment of the luminometer system. Each of the proposed measurements allows a determination of the bias that ensures a residual uncertainty on the absolute luminosity smaller than 10 \u22124 . In practice, they are likely to be combined, possibly with other measurements which, as the ones proposed here, are sensitive to the beam-beam interactions. An energy scan around the Z peak, allowing a detailed study of the Z line shape, is a crucial part of the FCC-ee physics programme. A precision of a few tens of keV on the width of the Z boson could be reached provided that the relative luminosity of the datasets taken at the different energies is known with a precision of O(10 \u22125 ). The ramp-up period of the machine allows the luminosity bias to be determined with a statistical uncertainty of 1 \u2212 2% for a given fill, which corresponds to a residual uncertainty of 2 \u2212 3 \u2022 10 \u22125 on the luminosity. Summing up over the fills taken at each energy point reduces this statistical error to below 10 \u22125 . The systematic component of the uncertainty of the luminosity bias, that arises from the uncertainty of the dependence of the acollinearity variable on the longitudinal bunch length, is largely correlated from point to point. Consequently, the beam-beam effects are not expected to contribute significantly to the uncertainty of the relative normalisation.",

[15], a precise measurement of \u03b4\u03b1 is a crucial ingredient for a precise determination of the centre-of-mass energy of the collision, the motivation being summarised in what follows. Since the kick has no component along the z-axis, it has no effect on the centre-of-mass energy of the collision, given by  Consequently, such a misalignment \u03b4 x causes another component to Acol, Acol misalign , which is proportional to \u03b4 x and adds to the beam-induced component Acol beam . While the method of asymmetric acceptance would ensure that the bias on the luminosity acceptance remains below 10 \u22124 even for a large misalignment of 0.5 mm [2], \u03b4 x would have to be smaller than 5 \u00b5m for Acol misalign to be less than 5% of the nominal Acol beam . Should such a level of alignment not be achieved, one would need to disentangle Acol beam from Acol misalign in order to derive the luminosity correction from the \"mapping\" shown in figure 12. This distinction can be done by exploiting the fact that Acol beam scales linearly with the number of particles in the bunches, since both the p x kick and the angular deflection of the final state Bhabha electrons are proportional to the Lorentz force created by the beam, hence to the bunch intensity N . In contrast, Acol misalign is independent of N . A linear fit to measurements of Acol, made in bunches that differ in intensity, allows in principle the intercept (Acol misalign ) and the slope (Acol beam ) to be determined.",
