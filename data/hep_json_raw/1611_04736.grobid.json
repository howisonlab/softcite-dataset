Interactions of the 70 GeV proton beam with carbon, silicon and lead targets were studied to detect decays of charmed D 0 ,D 0 , D + , D \u2212 mesons and \u039b + c baryon near their production threshold. Measurements of lifetimes and masses have shown a good agreement with PDG data. The inclusive cross sections of charm production and their A-dependencies have been obtained. The yields of these particles are compared with the theoretical predictions and the data of other experiments. The measured cross section of the total open charm production \u03c3(cc) = 7.1 \u00b1 2.3(stat) \u00b1 1.4(syst) \u03bcb/nucleon at the collision c.m. energy \u221a s = 11.8 GeV is well above the QCD model predictions. The contributions of different kinds of charmed particles to the total cross section of the open charm production in proton-nucleus interactions vary with energy.",

Active target (AT) ( Fig. 1) contains 5 Si-detectors each 300 \u03bcm thickness and 1-mm pitch strips, the Pb-plate (220 \u03bcm thick) and C-plate (500 \u03bcm thick). The micro-strip tracking part of MSVD consists of 10 Si-detectors.  The vertex detector plays the main role in search of secondary vertexes with possible decays of a charm as the distance between a point of interaction and D meson decay point doesn't exceed 2 mm. We have the accuracy of primary vertex reconstruction along a beam of 100 microns (Fig. 2), secondary vertex -200 microns. Coordinate accuracy is equal in the cross plane to 10 microns. The spectrometer features allow one to get the effective mass resolution of \u03c3 = 4.4 MeV/c 2 for K 0 s and 1.6 MeV/c 2 for \u039b 0 masses, for the particles decayed before the MSVD tracking detectors.

The mass interval for the visual inspection has been limited to the region from 1.7 to 2.0 GeV/c 2 . The visual inspection significantly reduces the background in the region of interest, but the charm + anti-charm (D 0 /D 0 ) signal decreased only on 20%. The data fit by the sum of the straight line and the Gaussian function is shown in Fig. 3b (right). It gives 1861 MeV/c 2 for (D 0 /D 0 ) mass with a standard deviation \u03c3 = 21 MeV/c 2 (\u03c7 2 /NDF = 5.5/6) and the signal to noise ratio of (51 \u00b1 17)/(38 \u00b1 13). The detection efficiency of (D 0 /D 0 ) particles with efficiency of visual inspection taken into account is equal to \u03b5(D 0 /D 0 ) = 0.036. ",

The charmed particles yields measured in our experiment are given in Table 3 and in Fig. 8 along with the data from other experiments and theoretical predictions. The contributions of charmed particles to the total cross section vary with energy. For example, the particles (D 0 and D + ) contributions go down as the interaction energy decreases to 70 GeV, while the antiparticles (D 0 , D \u2212 and \u039b + c ) contributions grow. A large difference of the charmed particle and    [27] antiparticle yields was firstly observed experimentally in neutron-nucleus interactions at the average neutron-beam energy of 43 GeV in the BIS-2 experiment [19]. Only antiparticle (D 0 and D \u2212 ) decays were observed there, while particle (D 0 and D + ) decays were not found (their cross sections proved to be below the sensitivity threshold). The results shown in Fig. 8 are compatible with the predictions of the statistical hadronization model [18], [20].   Table 3, the theoretical curves (with designation of a particle) are taken from [18].",
