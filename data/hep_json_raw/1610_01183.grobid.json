In this work, we find that for the DUNE baseline of 1300 km, due to enhanced matter effect, the neutrino and antineutrino probabilities are different which creates a tension in the case of combined runs because of which octant sensitivity also can come from disappearance channel. In view of this, we study the physics of antineutrinos in DUNE and explore the role of antineutrinos run that is required to resolve the octant degeneracy at a certain confidence levels.",

            "text": "The fact that neutrinos have tiny non-zero mass is well established from the various neutrino oscillation experiments and the study of neutrino physics has entered the precision era. The standard 3-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario has six key parameters and these are, two (mass) 2 differences (\u2206m 2 i1 , i = 2, 3), three mixing angles (\u03b8 ij , j > i = 1, 2, 3) and the CP phase \u03b4 CP . Global analysis of neutrino oscillation data provide the best-fit values and 3\u03c3 ranges of these parameters and are given in [1,2,3]. The remaining unknown in neutrino oscillation physics are (a) the sign of |\u2206m 2 31 |(\u2206m 2 31 > 0, known as normal hierarchy (NH) or \u2206m 2 31 < 0, known as inverted hierarchy (IH)), (b) the octant of \u03b8 23 ( \u03b8 23 < 45 \u2022 , known as lower octant (LO) or \u03b8 23 > 45 \u2022 , known as higher octant (HO)) and (c) the CP phase \u03b4 CP . Information on these unknown parameters can come from the currently running long baseline experiments like T2K [4] and NO\u03bdA [5,6]. But the main problems which these experiments have to overcome is the issue of parameter degeneracies by which it is meant that different set of parameters can provide equally good fit to the data.",

            "text": "In this letter our main focus is on the resolution of octant degeneracy using next generation superbeam experiment DUNE. Currently, neutrino oscillation experiment, like, T2K gives the most accurate measurements of the parameter \u03b8 23 . The prime channel for this parameter is the disappearance channel P \u00b5\u00b5 . For baselines shorter than 1000 km this channel has an intrinsic octant degeneracy because of the presence of sin 2 2\u03b8 23 in the leading order term of the probability expression. Whereas the probability expression of P \u00b5e channel depends on the combination of sin 2 \u03b8 23 sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and hence does not suffer from intrinsic degeneracy but has generalized degeneracies which were addressed in [7,8,9,10,11]. Here, our main goal is to understand the role of antineutrinos in enhancing the octant sensitivity of DUNE experiment. It was observed that the main complication that arises in octant determination is due to the unknown value of \u03b4 CP in the subleading terms of P \u00b5e channel which gives rise to octant-\u03b4 CP degeneracy. It was discussed in [12,13] that combining the reactor measurement of \u03b8 13 with the accelerator data will be beneficial for extraction of information on the octant value from the P \u00b5e channel. The combined measurement of P \u00b5\u00b5 channel with P \u00b5e channel in long baseline experiments can also be helpful in determining the octant degeneracy because of the non-identical functional dependence of the two probabilities on \u03b8 23 . We present the results of the octant sensitivity using various combinations of (\u03bd and \u03bd) run as a function of true \u03b4 CP for fixed values of true \u03b8 23 . In addition, we also present the precision of \u03b8 23 in (true:\u03b8 23 -test:\u03b8 23 ) plane. The details of numerical simulation and experimental specifications that we have considered are given in [14] and the references there in.",

The main point to notice here is that, though only neutrino run suffers from octant degeneracy, still we get octant sensitivity around 3\u03c3. This is one of the special features of the on axis beam based neutrino oscillation experiment where the degeneracy does not exist over the complete energy range and one can still have some octant sensitivity only from the neutrino channel. However, storyline changes if the hierarchy is unknown then there is a wrong hierarchy(WH)-wrong octant(WO) solutions in the region 9 \u2022 < \u03b4 CP < 90 \u2022 . We see that once antineutrino run added, say [7+3] years of (\u03bd + \u03bd) run, octant degeneracy can be resolved with more than 4\u03c3 C.L. even without the knowledge of the true hierarchy for all values of \u03b4 CP .  In the case of IH-LO as shown in the right column of fig.(1) when \u2212180 \u2022 < \u03b4 CP < 0 \u2022 only neutrino suffers from degeneracy whereas addition of antineutrino run enhances the sensitivity because they do not suffer from octant degeneracy 1 and hence a large octant sensitive contribution to the \u03c7 2 is added. These combinations of hierarchy\u2212octant can resolve octant degeneracy with 5\u03c3 sensitivity with (5+5) years of (\u03bd + \u03bd) run for any value of \u03b4 CP .",

Both these figures demonstrate the relation between precision of \u03b8 and octant degeneracy. From these plots we see that only for neutrino run (i.e (10+0)) there are other allowed values of \u03b8 23 apart from the true value, if \u03b8 23 \u2208 LO (HO) at \u03b4 CP = \u221290 \u2022 (+90 \u2022 ) . This happens because of the existence of octant degeneracy. As we have seen from fig.(1) that for \u03b4 CP = \u221290 \u2022 (+90 \u2022 ), neutrinos suffer from octant degeneracy in LO (HO) and this in turn affects the precision of \u03b8 23 which is clearly seen from this figures.
