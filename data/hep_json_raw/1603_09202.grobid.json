It is optimised to study proton-proton collisions at the highest possible energies, but has capabilities also for heavy-ion and very forward physics. The ATLAS inner detector is housed inside a solenoid which produces a 2 T axial field. It is surrounded by calorimeters and a muon spectrometer based on a toroidal magnet configuration. The calorimeters extend up to a pseudorapidity |\u03b7| = 4.9, where \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2), with \u03b8 being the polar angle with respect to the nominal LHC beam-line in the beam-2 direction. Charged particle tracks are measured by the inner detector in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. In the right-handed ATLAS coordinate system, with its origin at the nominal IP, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured with respect to the x-axis, which points towards the centre of the LHC ring. As shown in figure 1, side A of ATLAS is defined as the side of the incoming, clockwise, LHC beam-1 while the side of the incoming beam-2 is labelled C. The coding of LHC machine elements uses letters L (left of IR, when viewed from ring centre) for ATLAS side A and, correspondingly, R for side C. The z-axis in the ATLAS coordinate system points from C to A, i.e. along the beam-2 direction. The most relevant ATLAS subdetectors for the analyses presented in this paper are the Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) [10], LUCID, the calorimeters, and the Pixel detector.",

Building on published results based on 2011 data, the correlations between background and residual pressure of the beam vacuum are revisited. Ghost charge evolution over 2012 and its role for backgrounds are evaluated. New methods to monitor ghost charge with beam-gas rates are presented and observations of LHC abort gap population by ghost charge are discussed in detail. Fake jets from colliding bunches and from ghost charge are analysed with improved methods, showing that ghost charge in individual radio-frequency buckets of the LHC can be resolved. Some results of two short periods of dedicated cosmic-ray background data-taking are shown; in particular cosmic-ray muon induced fake jet rates are compared to Monte Carlo simulations and to the fake jet rates from beam background. A thorough analysis of a particular LHC fill, where abnormally high background was observed, is presented. Correlations between backgrounds and beam intensity losses in special fills with very high \u03b2 * are studied.",

Bunch intensities up to 1.6\u00d710 11 protons were routinely reached. The high-luminosity experiments at the LHC are designed to cope with intense background from pp collision debris, compared to which the usual levels of beam-induced backgrounds (BIB) are negligible. When beam intensities and energies increase, the risk for adverse beam conditions, that could compromise the performance of inner detectors, grows. In order to rapidly recognise and mitigate such conditions, a thorough understanding of background sources and observables is necessary. The main purpose of this paper is to contribute to this knowledge.",

The time resolution of a BLM is limited by its electronics to about 40 \u00b5s, so it cannot be used to determine loss rates of individual bunches. Since the BLMs are located around very different machine elements, with different internal shielding, their response with respect to one lost proton is not uniform. Thus, without detailed response simulations, the BLMs cannot be used to compare the losses in two different locations. They serve mainly to give information about the time development of losses on a given accelerator element. The loss-rates on the TCT would be most interesting for background studies. Unfortunately, in this location, the BLMs are subject to intense debris from the collisions, so during physics operation they have no sensitivity to halo losses. Another beam monitoring system is the Longitudinal Density Monitor (LDM), which is used to measure the population in each RF bucket by synchrotron light emission [8]. The system has sufficiently good time resolution and charge sensitivity to detect ghost charge in individual RF buckets with an intensity several orders of magnitude below the nominal bunch intensity of \u223c 10 11 protons/bunch.

Radiative energy losses of these muons in calorimeter material, if large enough, are reconstructed as jets and can form a significant background to certain physics searches [13]. A characteristic feature of the high-energy muon component of BIB is that, due to the bending in the dipole magnets of the LHC, it is predominantly in the horizontal plane. The CRB is entirely due to high-energy muons. These can penetrate the 60 m thick overburden and reach the experiment. Just like the BIB muons, the CRB muons can create fake jets in the calorimeters by radiative energy losses and thereby introduce backgrounds to physics searches [14].",

For some of the per-BCID rate studies presented in this paper this integration time proved too long and recourse to the luminosity data from the BCM had to be made. These data, dedicated for luminosity measurement with the BCM, are available as LB-averages, i.e. with a typical time resolution of 60 s, for each BCID independently. As for the BCM triggers, the luminosity data are based on a hit in any of the four modules on one side. The time-window to accept events for the luminosity algorithms is 12.5 ns, starting at the nominal collision time. For the purpose of this paper only the single-side rates are relevant and will be denoted as BCM-TORx.7 By comparing BCM-TORx rates in colliding bunches, the difference in efficiency, including acceptance, between sides A and C was found to be <1%. Since those data are recorded independently for each side, it is not possible to reconstruct the background-like timing pattern. Consequently these data are most useful for unpaired bunches in conditions where the BIB is high compared to other signals. Such cases will be encountered in sections 10.1 and 10.2. Recourse to the BCM luminosity data will also be made in section 7.2 when describing a new method to disentangle ghost collisions from noise and BIB.",

This is illustrated in figure 2, using data from the high-\u03b2 * fill with very low luminosity and only two colliding bunches. The normal luminosity signal is seen in BCID 1886 and is of comparable size during high beam losses and in normal conditions. The background signal appears five BCID earlier and peaks in BCID 1881. In normal conditions it is much smaller than the luminosity peak, but during high losses it can become very prominent.

The beam pattern of 2011, with 1331 colliding bunches, was used at the beginning of 2012 data-taking until instabilities of the unpaired bunches [22] required finding a different filling scheme. The intermediate solution was a 1377 colliding bunch pattern with only three unpaired bunches per beam, which were all non-isolated according to the ATLAS standard definition. In order to retain one bunch in the unpaired isolated group, which is used primarily for background monitoring, it was decided to relax the isolation requirement from 150 ns to 100 ns. Continuing instabilities led the LHC to introduce temporarily a fill pattern with 1380 colliding bunches, leaving none unpaired. During this period, lasting from 24 May until 5 June, there was no background monitoring capability. After optimisation of the LHC machine parameters, the unpaired bunches could be reintroduced and soon afterwards (from LHC fill 2734 onwards) an optimal fill pattern was implemented. This pattern with 1368 colliding bunches has a mini-train of six unpaired bunches per beam in the ideal location, immediately after the abort gap in odd BCIDs 1-11 and 13-23. In this pattern the first colliding train started in BCID 66 and the last colliding bunch before the abort gap was in BCID 3393. Initially the beam-1 mini-train was first, but at the end of the year (24 November, from LHC fill 3319 onwards) the trains were swapped in order to disentangle possible systematic beam-1/beam-2 differences and effects caused by the relative order of the unpaired trains.",

The component of the afterglow BIB which arrives within the same BCID as the unpaired bunch is particularly significant for some observations to be discussed in this paper. This part has a very non-uniform, rapidly dropping, time distribution within the BCID and cannot be easily subtracted. The afterglow BIB level is a small fraction of the primary beam-gas rate, i.e. the rate seen as in-time hits in the downstream modules. However, since the afterglow BIB is correlated with the beam-gas events, there will be a bias towards primary beam-gas and afterglow BIB signal to form a collision-like coincidence, i.e. provide real and apparent in-time hits on both sides of the IP. In order for this to happen the afterglow has to arrive at the upstream detectors with a delay corresponding to the time-of-flight between the two BCM detector arms,  i.e. about 12.5 ns \u00b1\u2206t. Here, \u2206t is the tolerance allowed by the coincidence trigger window. If the downstream signal is exactly in time, \u2206t = 2.7 ns for L1_BCM_Wide after TS3 and 6.3 ns for observing simultaneous BCM-TORx signals on both sides. Since the afterglow BIB signal is very small, the overwhelming afterglow from the collisions prevents extracting it from stable-beam data. However, around 20 minutes of data at the start of each fill is obtained during the FLAT-TOP and SQUEEZE phases, in which the full-energy beams are separated and so there is no large afterglow from collisions. Figure 4(a) shows the BCM-TORx rates for unpaired bunches and empty BCID around them, averaged over most fills with the 1368 colliding bunch structure. Only fills until the start of the BCM noise period are included. It is clearly seen that the background noise (BCIDs<1 and BCIDs>23) is low and BCID-independent.",

Also, the primary beam-gas signals themselves disagree by about 28%, i.e. much more than the efficiency difference of the two sides. This discrepancy reflects a real difference in beam background, possibly due to systematically worse vacuum on side A. These arguments motivate processing the data by first subtracting the background noise and then rescaling one beam such that the primary BIB signals match. For each beam the noise level is determined as an average over 20 empty BCIDs preceding the first unpaired bunch. The rates in BCID 13-24 are multiplied by a factor of 1.28 in order to bring the primary BIB signals on the two sides into agreement.",

For beam-1 a pronounced early peak on the A-side is observed in figure 5(a), corresponding to the background associated with the incoming bunch. It is followed by a long tail, consistent with afterglow BIB . Beam-1 exits on the C-side and correspondingly the peak appears around bin 43, i.e. 'in-time' with respect to the nominal collisions, again followed by a tail due to afterglow BIB . In figure 5(b) similar structures are seen for beam-2, but on the opposite sides. However, there are also some entries consistent with early hits in downstream modules. A flat, or slowly falling, pedestal is expected from noise and afterglow causing random triggers. But instead clear peak-like structures are seen in figure 5, especially in unpaired BCIDs of beam-1.

If information from an individual gauge was not received for a short time interval, the gap was bridged by using the last available value, provided it was in the same fill and not older than 10 minutes. Obviously erratic readings were rejected by requiring that the value was within a reasonable range (10 \u221211 -10 \u22126 mbar).9 The pressure was determined by first taking the average of the pair of readings closest to each other and including the value from the third gauge only if it did not deviate by more than a factor of three from this pair-average. Such a three-gauge average was accepted in 97% of luminosity blocks and in only 0.3% of cases a two-gauge average was used. The number of cases that all gauges deviated by more than a factor of three from each other negligible. In 2.7% of luminosity blocks no valid pressure data could be determined and the luminosity block was ignored. Figure 6 shows the obtained fit parameters for the periods listed in table 2 using either p22 only, i.e. f = 1.0, or a combination of p22 and p58 in eq. 7.1. It can be seen that the value of A, which corresponds to the absolute normalisation, is systematically lower for beam-2, which implies that for the same measured pressure there is less background from beam-2 than beam-1. The difference varies over the year, but is roughly 20% during the operation with 1368 colliding bunches (periods 3 and 4). The two sides of ATLAS are symmetric, so there is no obvious explanation why the backgrounds should be different.

A significant fraction of the raw L1_BCM_Wide and L1_J10 trigger rates in unpaired bunches are due to accidental coincidences or, in the case of the latter, fake jets due to BIB muons. In this analysis ghost collisions are selected offline from the recorded event data by requiring the presence of a reconstructed vertex in a volume consistent with the luminous region and with at least two associated tracks. In order to estimate the rates correctly, -  the vertex reconstruction efficiency has to be known. A method for estimating this from data for L1_BCM_Wide will be presented. Luminosity blocks, or entire fills, that do not meet general data quality requirements are removed from the analysis. Figure 8(a) shows the L1_BCM_Wide rates for events with and without a reconstructed vertex. The asymmetry of the ghost collision rate is striking. As expected, the rate is much higher for lower isolation -but only for the first unpaired train, i.e. beam-1. For the second train, comprising unpaired bunches in beam-2, the rates remain high even for isolated bunches. This asymmetry arises from the beam extraction from the PS, where the kicker is timed to the start of the unpaired train, but will also extract any possible trailing ghost bunches. As a result the unpaired trains systematically have more intensity in trailing than heading injected ghost bunches. The L1_J10 rates shown in figure 8(b) confirm this shape. The plots also show that the unpaired isolated definition of having no bunch within 3 BCID in the other beam is adequate for the first train, while it includes a nonnegligible tail of ghost collisions in the second train. This feature is preserved also after swapping the unpaired trains late in 2012, i.e. depends on the order of the trains and not on the beam.",

However, a barely visible hump in the centre (around BCID 11) can be identified, which is due to real collisions where vertex reconstruction has failed. Assuming that the probability of fake vertex reconstruction and the vertex reconstruction inefficiency are both small, the latter can be estimated from the relative sizes of the small and the large peaks in figure 8(a). This yields an estimate of 1.1 % for the vertex reconstruction inefficiency. It must be emphasised, however, that this is the value with respect to collision events seen by the BCM and not a global inefficiency of ATLAS vertex reconstruction. Furthermore, a comparison of the flat tails in figure 8(a), taking into account this inefficiency, provides an estimate of 1.27 for the beam-1/beam-2 ratio of BIB, which is perfectly consistent with the factor 1.28 derived in section 6 and 1.20 \u00b1 0.17 found in section 7.",

Since the BCM and the calorimeters are totally independent and look at very different observables, it is not conceivable that the rise would be due to an increase of some random contribution.

Such BIB muons, with energies potentially up to the TeV range, may enter the ATLAS calorimeters and deposit energy which is then reconstructed as a fake jet. The simulations of BIB show that the high-energy muons leading to fake jets at radial distances of R > 1 m, originate from the tertiary collimators or, in the case of beam-gas collisions, even further away [1,11]. Nearly every physics analysis in ATLAS requires good quality jets with the pile-up contribution suppressed and non-collision backgrounds removed. In reference [1] various sets of jet cleaning criteria were proposed to identify NCB. Since then, these have been commonly used in ATLAS analyses. While calorimeter noise appears at a rate low enough to not significantly increase the trigger rate, calorimeter hot cells, BIB and CRB-muons may take up a significant fraction of the event recording bandwidth. The number of events triggered by a fake jet and entering a given analysis, strongly depends on the event topology considered. Single-jet selections are most likely to pick up a fake jet on top of minimum-bias collisions that happen during every crossing of two nominal bunches. Therefore, analyses with jets and missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) in the final state, such as the mono-jet analysis [13], crucially depend on an efficient jet-cleaning strategy. More complicated topologies will include NCB only if it is in combination with other hard collision products.",

In practice one expects a \"banana\" signature from the ghost bunch every 2.5 ns. The pedestal appears uniform because the jet times are smeared out at central \u03b7. But focusing on |\u03b7| > 2 the timing signal of the outgoing beam background is sharp enough to resolve a detailed time structure of RF buckets, as shown in figure 15. A comparison of figures 15(a) and 15(b) illustrates the appearance of the uniform pedestal and the RF bucket structure which is characteristic of de-bunched ghost charge.",

In the MC simulations the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd+jets and W \u2192 l\u03bd+jets electroweak processes are generated using Sherpa 1.4.1 [25], including leading-order matrix elements for up to five partons in the final state and assuming massive b/c-quarks, with the CT10 [26] parton distribution functions. The Monte Carlo expectations are normalised to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative QCD predictions using DYNNLO [27,28] and MSTW2008 NNLO parton distribution function set [29]. The generated events are interfaced with the GEANT4 [30] detector simulation. Approximately 1.4 million data events are selected from the full 2012 dataset, out of which more than half correspond to non-collision backgrounds. The azimuthal distribution of the leading jet, shown in figure 17(a), exhibits clear spikes at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c0, that are characteristic for beam-induced backgrounds [1], on top of the uniform distribution from the pp collision products described by the Monte Carlo simulation.

While such a discrepancy would be considered large for simulation of pp-collisions, it is reasonably good agreement for this kind of simulation. The uncertainties in the shape and normalisation of the parametrisation of the muon flux at the surface are about 10%. More significant uncertainties are related to the muon transport through the overburden, i.e. the exact density and composition of the \u223c60 m thick soil above the experiment. The principal message of figure 21 is, that the simulations describe well the spectrum of the CRB related fake jets up to the highest apparent p T -values. Figure 22 shows the distribution of jet multiplicities (n jet ) for selected events containing at least one jet with p T > 40 GeV. The data and Monte Carlo distributions agree to within \u223c 30% for n jet < 3, indicating that the Monte Carlo simulation of single CRB muons provides a reasonable representation of the data at low jet multiplicities. The deviation of the absolute normalisation is related to that observed in figure 21. For jet multiplicities above two, however, the number of selected data events significantly exceeds the Monte Carlo expectations. This is to be expected due to the presence of multiple-muon events in the data generated by extensive air showers [34][35][36], which are not modelled by the Monte Carlo generator.",

Therefore, the CRB data are further restricted to contain only leading jets in the tracker acceptance |\u03b7| < 2.5 that pass the inverted cleaning selection f ch / f max < 0.1 used to select the NCB events from the -34 - colliding bunches. Furthermore, the same kinematic and topological selection as in section 8.2 is imposed. A comparison of the rates is shown in figure 23 for jet p T > 200 GeV. The higher jet p T threshold is chosen in order to avoid turn-on effects caused by the E miss T selection in the CRB events where both the muon and the induced fake jet are reconstructed in such a way that the two objects weigh against each other in the E miss T calculation. The NCB rate from the colliding bunches -35 -is corrected for the live-time of the 2012 data-taking with 1368 colliding bunches. As in the case of the rate from the CRB data, the rate is scaled up such that it corresponds to all 3564 BCIDs being filled with a nominal bunch.

Thus both the collision probing and LDM show more ghost charge in beam-1, while the BIB rates in the direction opposite to the unpaired bunches indicate more background from beam-2 ghost bunches. This apparent paradox can be resolved by postulating that the ghost-BIB is dominated by cleaning debris and not by beam-gas interactions. Under this assumption the asymmetry of the LHC, with respect to beam cleaning insertions, plays an important role in explaining the observations. The momentum cleaning, located in IR3, is only two octants away from ATLAS along beam-2, but 6 octants along beam-1. In addition beam-1 has to pass both IR5 (CMS) and IR7 with its very tight betatron collimation. Thus, debris from momentum cleaning in IR3 is much more likely to make it to ATLAS in beam-2 than in beam-1.",

As explained in section 3 this de-bunched ghost charge is rather uniformly distributed in the entire ring and therefore the contribution from IR3 debris to the BIB is roughly the same for all RF buckets, including those filled with a nominal bunch. A nominal bunch has at least 3 orders of magnitude higher intensity than a ghost bunch and since the beam-gas rate is proportional to intensity, the role of IR3 debris for nominal bunches is negligible compared to close-by beam-gas scattering.

The systematic tendency for higher intensity in trailing than heading injected ghost bunches implies that after the swap the intensity of injected beam-2 ghost bunches (L1_BCM_CA triggers) in beam-1 unpaired locations should be higher than before the swap. A comparison of per-BCID rates between mid-August and the onset of the BCM noise, and after the swap of unpaired trains is shown in figure 25. The data clearly indicate that even when the beam-1 train is first, there is more BIB from injected beam-2 ghost bunches than from beam-1, consistent with figure 24. After the swap of the unpaired trains the BIB from injected beam-1 ghost bunches is very low, while there is a large increase for beam-2, as expected. Figure 26 shows the BCM background rates due to ghost bunches for all 2012 fills with 1368 colliding bunches. A sudden increase of background from beam-2 ghosts is seen, coincident with the chromaticity changes in early August11 [38], while no rise is seen in the beam-1 direction. At 11Coincident with the chromaticity changes the LHC also switched octupole polarities on 7 August, which is another possible candidate for having caused the jump. The data indicate, however, that the background started to rise already three days earlier, when the chromaticity optimisation started.  the same time, the fill-to-fill scatter increases significantly. Since chromaticity settings might affect how tight the momentum cleaning in IR3 is, this observation further supports the interpretation that the excess background, attributed to ghost bunches, originates from IR3.",

Its size is the same as in figure 15(a), which implies that there is no change in the BIB from unpaired bunches. Unlike in figure 15(a), several smaller peaks are observed in figure 15(b), especially for beam-2. These peaks reflect the 2.5 ns time-structure of the LHC RF, which is consistent with them being due to ghost charge produced by de-bunching in the LHC. The level of these peaks, however, is only a factor 20-50 below the main peak, which is much less than the intensity difference (at least 3 orders of magnitude) between nominal and ghost bunches. This observation, that ghost bunches produce more background per unit intensity than nominal ones, provides further evidence that their losses are dominated by beam cleaning and not beam-gas interactions. Figure 28 shows the timing distribution of fake jets in the direction opposite to the unpaired bunch, i.e. corresponding to ghost-BIB from the other beam. Like in figure 15, smaller peaks reflect the RF structure and indicate that the ghost charge is distributed among all buckets. It should be noted that there is no central peak in the A \u2192 C direction, just an almost uniform pedestal. This is consistent with the assumption that there is negligible fake jet production due to beam-1 ghost bunches and the observed rate is due to the smeared-out incoming beam-2 contribution where individual buckets cannot be resolved.12 In the C \u2192 A direction, the side-peaks are clearly visible, but the absolute level is similar to the other direction. The reason is that in both directions the rate is dominated by beam-2 ghost-BIB, but only in the C \u2192 A direction, i.e. downstream, is the time-spread small enough to resolve individual buckets (see figure 14). A comparison of the 12This is best understood from figure 14 where it is seen that downstream fake jets have a narrow time distribution, while upstream ones are smeared out.  Figure 28.

The plots are normalised by the live-time, the rate is averaged over the six unpaired BCIDs per beam and the bin width is 0.5 ns. pedestals, i.e. the rates for |t| > 4 ns, reveals that their levels are almost identical in figures 15(b) and 28(b). This is consistent with the pedestal being dominated by losses of the debunched ghost charge, which mostly are smeared out in time.",

While it is established that the injectors generate more intense injected ghost bunches in the nominal RF buckets, it is also assumed that those bunches would not be sufficiently off-momentum to reach IR3 cleaning. It is possible, however, that those low-intensity injected ghost bunches develop larger off-momentum tails than nominal ones. Another observation that can be made in figure 28 is that the side-peaks in the beam-2 (C\u2192A) direction are higher for earlier arrival, t < 0, than for t > 0. This might be related to a preferred direction of de-bunching from the injected ghost bunch in the t = 0 bucket: de-bunching is predominantly due to energy loss, as a result of which the particle moves to a slightly smaller radius and arrives earlier on subsequent turns.",

This implies that the effect should be visible also in BCIDs, which are not paired with an unpaired bunch in the other beam. An observation of the beam-2 excess in such BCIDs would also exclude any accidental coincidences involving the unpaired bunch. Such an excess in the beam-2 (C\u2192A) direction can, indeed, be seen in the rates shown for empty bunches in figure 25, but the cleanest possible sample of empty bunches can be found in the abort gap.  The points correspond to the average over all fills with the 1368 colliding bunch pattern, using the first five hours of stable beams and the error bars show the RMS of this average, thus reflecting any fill-to-fill variation. Fills shorter than five hours are not considered. Data shown are averages over periods before (a) and after (b) the LHC chromaticity changes. For plotting, the BCIDs in the abort gap have been re-mapped to negative values by BCID = BCID true -3564. The high rates just above BCID=0 correspond to the unpaired bunches. Figure 29 shows the background rates due to ghost-BIB as a function of BCID. It is evident that prior to the chromaticity changes both beams produce very similar levels of BIB, dominated by accidental background-like coincidences from afterglow pp or noise. The gently falling slope is explained by the decreasing afterglow pp following colliding trains before the abort gap. The situation is entirely different after mid-August: while the same smooth slope is observed for beam-1, the BIB from beam-2 reveals a periodic structure of humps. As indicated by the small error bars -which include the effect of fill-to-fill differences -the pattern of the humps is the same for all fills.",

The principle of abort gap cleaning is that excitations are introduced by the transverse damper system of the LHC. Figure 31(a) shows how BIB rates in different BCID-ranges of the abort-gap react to the cleaning in fill 3067. The cleaning was switched on and off several times during the fill. The BCID ranges are shown in figure 31(b), which gives per-BCID rates averaged over the periods indicated in figure 31(a). The solid black curve in figure 31(b) shows the estimated contribution from random coincidences. This has been subtracted in figure 31(a). Figures 31(a) and 31(b) show that as soon as the cleaning is switched on a large hump develops in the latter part of the abort gap while the hump in the early part is strongly suppressed. This suggest that the gap is filling up from the \"right\" (in figure 31(b)), i.e. off-momentum particles tend to move faster and arrive earlier. When the cleaning is switched off, a reduction of BIB rates is seen for all BCID ranges shown in figure 31(a), but only in the first bin (1 luminosity block, i.e. typically 60 s) following the cleaning. Thereafter the BIB rates return to their pre-cleaning levels.

The overall shape of beam-1 background seen by this method is perfectly consistent with figure 32, but since the tagged events have exact time-stamps, it is possible to significantly improve the time resolution. Figure 33 shows the time-dependence of the background over four minutes close to the maximum and a clear substructure is resolved. All unpaired isolated BCIDs exhibit a consistent periodic fluctuation with a frequency of the order of 0.1 Hz and significant amplitude.

Efficiency differences of individual Pixel modules lead to a rather non-uniform azimuthal distribution of cluster rates even for minimum-bias events, which produce secondaries uniformly in \u03c6. In order to compensate for this and extract the azimuthal asymmetry of the BIB, the rates of clusters in events tagged as BIB have been normalised by the cluster rates of minimum bias events in the same fill. The results for the innermost layer of the Pixel detector are shown in figure 35. The very high rate of beam-1 background in fill 3252 is again illustrated by the difference of the level of beam-1 and beam-2 backgrounds seen in figure 35(a). The more interesting aspect, however, is that the azimuthal distribution is different from that seen in figure 35(b), which represents a normal fill. This indicates that the source distribution along the z-axis must be different in the two cases such that the secondaries traverse different magnet configurations. As argued before, in the high-background fill the beam-gas events must be localised in the inner triplet. In section 7 it is established that the background seen by the BCM correlates with the pressure at 22 m, i.e. the IP-end of the triplet, but this does not exclude the possibility of contributions from more distant locations, as long as they also correlate with the 22 m pressure. It is worth noting that the integral of the beam-1 histogram in figure 35(b) is found to be 29 % larger than that of beam-2. This difference is consistent with the 28 % found in sections 6 and 7 for the beam-1/beam-2 ratio of the BCM backgrounds. This agreement, and the observation of a different azimuthal distribution, support the assumption formulated at the end of section 7 that the background of beam-1 has either an additional contribution or originates from a different pressure distribution than that of beam-2.",

Because the forward detectors, ALFA [40] and TOTEM [41,42], approached the beam with their roman pots to a distance of only 3.0 nominal \u03c3, the collimators in IR7 were temporarily moved as close as 2.0 nominal \u03c3 in order to clean the immediate surroundings of the beam core. Around the same time IR3 collimators were closed to 5.9 \u03c3 while TCTs in IR1 and IR5 were retracted to \u03c3 throughout the fill. These and other collimator settings are summarised in table 1. This tight cleaning resulted in very large beam losses over short durations of time. Against the very low luminosity background, these loss-spikes provided a particularly clean environment to study the relationship between proton losses at the primary collimators and background seen in ATLAS.

As will be seen, a comparison between the two detectors is very useful, since in some cases it confirms real background while in others it uncovers mechanisms that result in wrong association of spikes to bunches. Figures 36(a-d) shows the observed beam-1 and beam-2 backgrounds as seen by BCM and LUCID while figures 36(e-f) indicate the loss in beam intensities. It can be seen that, especially in beam-2, large backgrounds are observed already at 20:15 UTC, about 10 minutes before any appreciable beam intensity loss is seen. A detailed analysis of BLM readings in the cleaning insertions, summarised in figure 37 together with the relevant collimator positions, reveals that the observed intensity losses are caused by IR7 collimators closing between 20:30 and 20:40 UTC ( figure 37(c-d)). Collimators in IR3 ( figure 37(a-b)), however, close already at 20:15 UTC and while they cause no visible intensity loss in figure 36(e) or (f) their movement and local losses seen in IR3 BLMs correlate perfectly with beam-2 background increase seen in ATLAS (figure 36(b) and (d)). This leads to the interpretation that ATLAS backgrounds from beam-2 are much more sensitive to losses in IR3 than those in IR7. This is not too surprising given that, for beam-2, IR3 is only two octants away from ATLAS.",

This observation is consistent with interpreting the beam-1 excess as afterglow from beam-2 halo impinging on the TAS, i.e. an effect similar to afterglow BIB , discussed in section 7.2, except that here the interactions happen on the TAS and not with residual gas. This confusion of the two beams does not appear in LUCID, where the signal from the upstream detector is used which means that the time-window for the incoming beam-1 bunch is more than 120 ns before the passage of the beam-2 bunch. Figure 38 shows the correlation between the bunch intensity loss rate and the BIB rate observed by LUCID. The dashed lines in the plots are only to guide the eye, but they indicate that for a given beam the correlation is the same for each BCID, while it differs for the two beams. In particular, a comparison of figure 38(b) with the other three plots of figure 38 confirms that the ratio between background and beam loss is about a factor of 30 smaller for beam-1 than for beam-2.

The principal methods to monitor backgrounds in ATLAS rely on the existence of unpaired bunches in the fill pattern. The BIB rates associated with these are observed by the Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and fake jets with p T > 10 GeV in the calorimeters. The observation, made already in 2011 background data that beam backgrounds seen by the BCM are strongly correlated with the residual pressure 22 m from the interaction point, is reestablished and further elaborated. In particular, it is shown that a scaling of the BCM background with a linear combination of the pressures around the inner triplet results in a very constant rate throughout 2012. Any deviations from this constant level are sensitive indications of abnormal beam-losses.",

Largely due to these cleaner conditions, the analysis of 2012 background data revealed features, related to ghost charge, which were not seen in the 2011 analysis. The most noteworthy observation is the high sensitivity of ATLAS to off-momentum ghost charge being lost in IR3. The debris from these cleaning losses is seen both by the BCM and as fake jets in the calorimeters. An analysis of these rates revealed a significant jump of BIB from beam-2 ghost charge in early August, coincident with the LHC changing chromaticities. BIB, due to ghost charge losses, could be observed in the 3 \u00b5s long abort gap and for beam-2 was found to exhibit an unexpected hump-structure following the chromaticity changes, but not before. During periods of dedicated abort gap cleaning by the LHC these losses increased. Immediately after the cleaning a reduction of background was observed, but only for the order of one minute. This suggests that the abort gap is filled by de-bunched beam with a time constant of the order of one minute.",

After proper normalisation, the rates of fake jet rates due to BIB and CRB could be compared, showing that beyond p T \u223c 1 TeV the rates are similar, while at p T \u223c 200 GeV, the CRB-muons produce only 10% of the total fake jet rate.",

Any cross-talk between horizontal and vertical modules, e.g. by two different -58 -  secondaries from the same event, would lead to an increase of the trigger rate in BCM DEV. The upper limit of the increase is a factor of 2, corresponding to fully uncorrelated hits in the modules. Unlike for the collision-dominated L1_BCM_Wide, there is no other rate to which the BCM background trigger could be compared. The raw L1_BCM_AC_CA data, even after bunch intensity normalisation, are found to have a scatter much larger than the effect of the trigger change. The method employed to reduce this scatter by taking into account the vacuum conditions is described in section 7.1. The normalization with the residual pressure produces a reasonably flat distribution before and after TS3, and allows deriving the change in L1_BCM_AC_CA rate to be a factor of 1.22 \u00b1 0.01 for beam-1 and 1.19 \u00b1 0.01 for beam-2. This is illustrated in figure 41(b). For simplicity a unique factor of 1.2 was applied to L1_BCM_AC_CA rates prior to TS3 for both beams.",

The count rates for hits distributed randomly in time, e.g. afterglow pp and noise, depend on the width of the windows and if these rates are to be compared an appropriate correction has to be applied. The BCM-TORx rates correspond to an acceptance window of 12.5 ns width, while the BCM_Wide window is only 5.1 ns wide, which implies that a correction factor of 0.41 has to be applied to pedestal hits distributed uniformly in time. Since no correction is needed for in-time BIB, the correction factor for random BIB+pedestal coincidences amounts to this 0.41. Pedestal+pedestal coincidences have to be corrected by 0.41 2 = 0.17 when comparing rates derived from BCM-TORx to L1_BCM_Wide rates.",
