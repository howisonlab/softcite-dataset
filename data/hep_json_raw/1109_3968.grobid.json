KLOE has performed several precision measurements, here we present the preliminary analysis of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decay channel to study box anomaly and the recently published branching ratio measurement of \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay channel, never observed before. Pseudoscalar production at the \u03c6-factory associated to internal conversion of the photon into a lepton pair allows the measurement of the form factor F(q 2 1 = M(\u03c6) 2 , q 2 2 > 0) of pseudoscalar mesons in the kinematical region of interest for the VMD model: a preliminary study of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 is based on 739 pb \u22121 , using the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state. From a sample of 240 pb \u22121 taken off the \u03c6 resonance, a preliminary analysis of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7 process, without e \u00b1 tagging in the final state has been performed. The same data set has been used to search for the f 0 (600) produced in \u03b3\u03b3 interactions via the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The KLOE detector is being upgraded with small angle tagging devices, to detect both high and low energy e \u00b1 in e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 X events. The inner tracker and small angle calorimeters are scheduled to be installed in a subsequent step, providing wider acceptance for both charged particles and photons. This is the new KLOE-2 project [1]: the detector is successfully rolled in the new DA\u03a6NE interaction region, with a new beam crossing scheme allowing for a reduced beam size and increased luminosity. The main goal of KLOE-2 is to collect an integrated luminosity of about 20 f b \u22121 in 2-3 years in order to refine and extend the KLOE physics programme.",

Those anomalous processes, known as box anomalies, proceed via a vector meson resonant contribution (VDM) and maybe via a direct term. The presence of this direct term affects the partial width value in the case of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and the dipion invariant mass distribution, in the case of",

            "text": "The knowledge of the \u03b7 meson coupling to virtual photons is important for calculation of anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, because the pseudoscalar exchange is the major contribution to the hadron light-by-light scattering [1]. In the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 process we have conversion decays, which offer the possibility to precisely measure the virtual photon 4-momentum, via the e + and e \u2212 4-momenta and we are directly sensitive to the \u03b7 meson transition form factor because there are no hadrons among the decay products. The first theoretical evaluation dates from 1967 [7] and predicts a branching ratio BR(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) = 2.59 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . Double lepton-antilepton \u03b7 decays have been searched by CMD-2 and WASA, obtaining upper limits at level of the theoretical expectation. KLOE has published the first observation of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay, analysing 1.7 f b \u22121 and identifing 362 \u00b1 29 events which results in a branching ratio of (2.4 \u00b1 0.2 stat+bkg \u00b1 0.1 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , in agreement with theoretical predictions [8]. Vector-meson-dominance assumption provides good description of photon coupling to hadrons, and, implementing systematic corrections to standard VMD, it correctly describes the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 experimental results too. In this framework deviation from standard VMD for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 decay spectrum is predicted. The only existing data available come from SND experiment, which has measured the M ee invariant mass distribution with 213 events [9]. KLOE has selected 7000 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 using a sample of 739 pb \u22121 . Preliminary fit to the M ee using decay parametrization from [10] and F(q 2 ) as from [11], indicates the possibility to reach a 5% error on form factor slope.",
