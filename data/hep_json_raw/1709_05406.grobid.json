            "text": "The standard model (SM) describes the vast majority of particle physics phenomena. So far, it has withstood a multitude of challenges from precision measurements. Searches for physics beyond the SM carried out by various experiments also have not revealed convincing evidence for the existence of such phenomena. A recent triumph of the SM is the 2012 discovery of a Higgs boson (H) by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC [1][2][3]. However, there are several open challenges that cannot be explained by the SM, such as the hierarchy problem [4][5][6] (and fine tuning), and the absence of a dark matter candidate. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] is an extension of the SM that introduces an additional symmetry between bosons and fermions, and predicts superpartners, or \"sparticles\", to the SM particles. This extension offers a solution to several limitations of the SM, -1 -",

The cross sections associated with electroweak production of SUSY particles are far lower than those for strong production. This directly translates into significantly lower exclusion limits, ranging from about 100 to 700 GeV [21][22][23][24] on the masses of sparticles produced exclusively via the electroweak interaction. This would be the dominant production mechanism of sparticles if the colored superpartners are too heavy to be produced.",

We further divide the events into three bins of invariant mass of the dilepton pair, M , in order to separate processes that include a Z boson in the decay chain from those that do not. One of the M bins is defined to be below the Z mass (M < 75 GeV) and the second one contains the events with M above the Z mass (M > 105 GeV), which enhances the sensitivity to the scenarios with various mass splittings between the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 . The third one is defined as the Z mass window (75 \u2264 M < 105 GeV), and it is expected to contain the bulk of the standard model background events. In the case of three same-flavor leptons, the OSSF pair with the invariant mass closest to the mass of the Z boson is used. The transverse mass M T of the third lepton in the event is computed with respect to p miss T . For the SM WZ \u2192 3 \u03bd process, the M T variable computed in this way is steeply falling around the W mass, and facilitates discrimination against the dominant background from WZ production in the search. Both variables, M T and p miss T , are used to further categorize the events with most of the standard model background expected in low M T and p miss T bins. These signal regions are summarized in table 2. Signal region \"B\" contains the events in which no OSSF pair is found, further sorted into two bins each for M and M T . The low M T bins are then further subdivided into two p miss T bins. Most of these events arise from a leptonic decay of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ; therefore, the M is calculated from the opposite-sign (OS) dilepton pair whose invariant mass is closest to the mean dilepton mass determined from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 simulation, which is 50 GeV. An event lacking an OS pair (all three leptons have the same sign) most likely arises from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 with one lepton charge misidentified.

Systematic uncertainties are derived from detailed evaluation of the modelling of this process. The uncertainty in the normalization of the WZ background is 10%. This includes statistical uncertainties in the yields in the control sample used for normalization, and in the subtraction of the non-WZ contributions to the sample. An additional uncertainty stems from the modelling of the M T shape in the simulation of the WZ process. To estimate the effect of a potentially different p miss T resolution and W width in data and simulation on the W boson M T distribution shape, we verify the M T shape prediction from simulation in W\u03b3 and W+jets control samples in data. After applying a threshold p T > 40 GeV on the photon to suppress the contribution of W\u03b3 events produced by final-state radiation (FSR) which influences M T , we find the W boson M T distribution shapes in simulated W\u03b3, W+jets, and WZ processes to be the same. We thus proceed to measure the W\u03b3 and W+jets M T shape in a dedicated control sample in which an energetic, well-identified, and isolated photon passing the aforementioned p T threshold is required, together with a lepton passing the same criteria as those selected in the trilepton search regions, and p miss T > 50 GeV. A minimum separation of \u2206R > 0.3 is required between the lepton and the photon to further reduce the FSR contribution. The residual W+jets contribution in this control sample is about 20%, and consists of events where a jet has very high electromagnetic fraction, and thus is not subject to large mismeasurements that might influence the M T tail. Residual contamination from processes other than W\u03b3 or W+jets is subtracted using MC, and the M T shape measured in this control region is compared to the one predicted by the WZ simulation. The measured shape is found to agree well with the prediction from simulation within the statistical uncertainties, and the precision of this comparison is used to derive systematic uncertainties on the high-M T bins of the trilepton search. This uncertainty is between 5 and 40%, from the comparison of the M T shape in the WZ simulation with the one measured in the W\u03b3 control region. The size of this uncertainty increases for higher M T values and is driven by the statistical uncertainty of the W\u03b3 control sample. Systematic uncertainties on the modelling of M are neglected as lepton momentum scale and resolution effects are too small to have significant effects in this analysis [51,68].",
