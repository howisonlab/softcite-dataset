The input data are neutral current and charged current inclusive cross sections measured by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at the ep collider HERA. The polarization of the electron beam was taken into account for the ZEUS and H1 data recorded between 2004 and 2007. Results are presented on the vector and axial-vector couplings of the Z boson to uand d-type quarks. The values are in agreement with Standard Model predictions. The results on a u and v u represent the most precise measurements from a single process.",

At HERA, values of Q 2 of up to 50 000 GeV 2 were reached, a regime where the contribution of Z exchange becomes comparable to the contribution from photon exchange.",

Thus the polarized H1 data should improve the determination of the couplings v u and v d in comparison to the analysis using only ZEUS polarized data [3].",

The data sets with different polarization were added and the resulting cross sections were corrected to zero polarization before they were used as input to the H1 and ZEUS data combination. A combination of the H1 and ZEUS polarized data preserving the information on polarization has not been published and therefore this analysis reverts to the original sets of cross sections for polarized beams as published by the individual collaborations, except that the ZEUS cross sections for polarized beams [4][5][6][7] are used with updated values of the polarization as published in the ZEUS EW analysis [3].",

            "text": "The reduced cross sections used as input to the analysis were published by the individual collaborations after QED corrections were applied. These corrections are mostly on the percent level, but reach 15% for a few cross sections. The correction factors were calculated by producing Monte Carlo data sets for which radiative corrections were either turned on or off for comparison. This was done with the program HERACLES [37], interfaced to the hadronization routines within the program DJANGOH [38]. The H1 collaboration published [8] a cross-check with the programs HECTOR [39] and EPRC [14] and concluded that the uncertainties are below 2% over the complete phase space. The H1 collaboration included these uncertainties in the uncorrelated uncertainties of their published cross sections, whereas the ZEUS collaboration did not assign any uncertainties to their QED corrections in their original TABLE II. The results from HH-EW-Z on the axial-vector and vector couplings of the Z boson to uand d-type quarks. Given are the experimental/fit (exp) and total (tot) uncertainties. For comparison, the results of ZEUS-EW-Z are also listed. In addition, results of fits with the PDFs fixed to HH-13p and HERAPDF2.0, for which only the couplings of the Z were free parameters, are given. Also listed are the SM predictions.  and the measurements from LEP \u00fe SLC [40], the Tevatron [41,42] and HERA I (H1) [43]. The fits HH-EW-Z and ZEUS-EW-Z are based both on HERA I and HERA II data and were not included in the combinations for PDG14 [18]. The PDG values and all measurements are compared in Fig. 7. The HH-EW-Z results on the axial-vector and vector couplings to u-type quarks are the most precise results published from a single process. As expected, the vector couplings from HH-EW-Z are significantly more accurate than from ZEUS-EW-Z.",

The PDFs are very similar. The PDF parameters of HH-EW-Z are only weakly correlated to the Z couplings. The full correlation matrix for the 13 PDF parameters and the four Z couplings is given in Table I. A comparison of the HH-EW-Z PDFs to the central values of the HERAPDF2.0 NLO is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). The PDFs are similar within uncertainties. The slight difference in shape of the central values is due to the use of a 14th parameter in the HERAPDF2.0 analysis.

This value of \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom is typical for QCD fits to the HERA combined data. The decrease of \u03c7 2 when fitting the uncombined data is due to a difference in the effect of the correlations taken into account before and after combination. The description of the data is good. The predictions of HH-EW-Z are compared to the high-precision e \u00fe p NC data from H1 [8] and ZEUS [5]  These values are compared to the results from ZEUS-EW-Z [3] in Table II. They agree within uncertainties. Also listed are SM predictions and values obtained from fits which were performed as cross-checks (i) a fit in which only the axial-vector and vector couplings of the Z were allowed to vary and the PDF parameters are fixed to those of the 13-parameter QCD-only fit, HH-13p; (ii) a fit in which only the axial-vector and vector couplings of the Z were allowed to vary and the PDF parameters are fixed to those of HER-APDF2.0 NLO. Only experimental/fit uncertainties were considered for these cross-checks. The values agree within the experimental uncertainties with the result from HH-EW-Z.",

They are shown 4 for a u , v u and a d , v d in Fig. 4 and for a u , a d and v u , v d in Fig. 5. These figures demonstrate very clearly that the HERA data constrain the couplings of the Z boson to the u quark significantly better than the couplings to the d quark. This is due to the larger u valence content of the proton and the larger charge of the u quark. The couplings as determined by HH-EW-Z are compatible with the SM. Figure 6 shows the 68% C.L. contours from HH-EW-Z, together with the contours from ZEUS-EW-Z [3]  ",
