From other point of view decays with odd number of pseudoscalars belong to the wider class of anomalous decays, in low-energy QCD such anomalous decays are governed by the Wess -Zumino -Witten (WZW) term [1]. In this approach the decay probability is not vanish, and there are as CP -conserving and CP -violating models for the process \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 4\u03c0 0 [2][3][4].",

The target is surrounded by guard system, which consists of scintilation veto layer and lead glass counters to detect recoiled baryons. This set of the detectors allows the identification of the charge-exchange processes with neutral final states. The main detector of GAMS-4\u03c0 Setup is the lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter GAMS [11].

The method proposed in Ref. [20] was used to set upper limit for the decay desired. The decays (1) and (3) are consider as the event sources for the experimental histogramm, Fig. (4). The mass spectra for these decays have been obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation. The mass shift of \u03b7 \u2032 peak position for decay (3) with two lost \u03b3 is \u2248 30 MeV, the peak becomes the width \u03c3 5\u03c0 \u2248 50 MeV, Fig. 4b. For decay (1) the mass resolution is \u03c3 4\u03c0 = 20 MeV after 5C-fit. One can see in Fig. 4a that experimental 4\u03c0 0 mass spectrum in (0.8-1.0) GeV interval is reproduced well by background spectrum (3). The upper limit is evaluated as",

One was found that main physical background arises from the chain of other neutral \u03b7 \u2032 decays with lost photons. This process can present a problem for other experiments, such as Crystal Ball [21], Crystal Barrel [22] WASA [23] to find the decay (1). To reduce this background electromagnetic calorimeter used in experiment must have a low detection threshold for photons and reconstruction procedures capable to resolve overlapping showers.",
