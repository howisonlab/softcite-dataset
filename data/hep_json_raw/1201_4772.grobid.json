At the LHC, the tt production cross section at \u221a s = 7 TeV is predicted to be 164.6 pb by approximate next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO) calculation and 157.5 pb by next-leading-order (NLO) calculation. The cross section measurement of tt is important for testing the perturbative QCD which is successful so far and searching for new physics. Any deviation would indicate possible new physics. It is crucial to measure the cross section in all decay modes since new physics can appear in any different decay modes. Top quark decays almost exclusively to W boson ans b quark. Therefore, the decay mode entirely depending on W boson branching ratio. In dilepton decay mode (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5), tau leptonic decay is included. Considering Br(\u03c4 \u2192 l\u03bd l \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 0.35, the branching ratio would be 6.8%, 3.8%, 30% and 44% for dilepton, lepton+tau, lepton+jets and all hadronic decay modes, respectively. In addition to inclusive cross section, the jet multiplicity distribution of tt with additional jets in lepton+jets decay mode is shown, which is important measurement to constrain the initial state radiation (ISR). As the deviation has been observed by Tevatron, the charge asymmetry measurement at the LHC are also performed using the fact that the width of top quark is slightly broader than anti-top quark in rapidity distribution at the LHC.",

Unlike Tevatron, it is hard to measure in pp collision due to the symmetric initial state of pp collisions at the LHC. Therefore, the rapidity distributions of top and anti-top quarks are symmetrically distributed around zero. However, it is feasible when we consider top quark (valence quark) width is broader than anti-top quark (see quark) width. At ATLAS, absolute rapidity was used.

These measurements are already systematically limited and starting to constrain theory. Improve pileup modeling and btagging is required to reduce the systematic uncertainty. The first measurements in fully hadronic decays and decays tau are presented. All measured results are compatible with SM prediction so far.",
