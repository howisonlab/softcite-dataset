A search for evidence of extra spatial dimensions has been performed, through an analysis of the diphoton final state in data recorded in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis uses a dataset of 2.12 f b \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The diphoton invariant mass spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model (SM) background. We set 95% CL lower limits on the scale related to virtual graviton exchange process in the context of the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Dvali model (ADD) and on the lightest Kaluza Klein excitation mass in the context of the Randall-Sundrum model (RS).",

The gravity is the only field that propagates in those extra dimensions and acquires Kaluza Klein (KK) modes. In the ADD context, resolving the hierarchy problem implies small values of 1/R. This leads to an almost continuous KK spectrum of the graviton mass. Experimentally, an ADD signal will contribute through virtual graviton exchange to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum. This process can be parametrized as a function of the number of extra dimensions n and an ultraviolet cutoff (M s ). Several formalisms exist in the literature to define M s , referred to here as GRW [4], HLZ [5] and Hewett [6].",

The fifth dimension has a \"warped\" geometry which allows to naturally generate TeV scales from the Planck scale. The fundamental Planck scale (M Pl ) on one brane is related to the apparent scale (\u039b \u03c0 ) on the other brane by the relation \u039b \u03c0 = M Pl exp (\u2212k\u03c0r c ) where k is the curvature scale of the extra dimension, r c the compactification radius and M Pl = M Pl \u221a 8\u03c0 . The observed hierarchy of scales can be naturally reproduced by this model with kr c \u2248 11. In the minimal RS model, gravitons are the only particles that propagate in the bulk. Consequently a series of massive KK excitations is predicted with a mass splitting of the order of 1 TeV. Finally the RS model can be expressed in terms of the coupling k/M Pl and the mass of the lightest KK excitation (m G ). Experimentally the presence of a RS signal can be probed as a narrow resonance in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum. a e-mail: quentin.buat@cern.ch",

Therefore we rely on the inner tracker and the calorimetric system of the detector. The tracking system of ATLAS is composed of layers of silicon-based and strawtube detectors surrounded by a 2 T magnetic field for momentum measurements. It allows to measure the tracks of the 30% of photons converting in e + e \u2212 pairs before reaching the calorimeter. The photon energy deposit is measured by the Liquid Argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter, covering the region 0 < |\u03b7| < 1.37 and 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.37. It is segmented in three longitudinal layers. Most of the energy of the electromagnetic (EM) shower is recovered by the second layer which has a granularity of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.025\u00d70.025. The first layer with a thinner segmentation is designed to reject jets dominated by neutral hadrons such as a \u03c0 0 or a \u03b7. Indeed, such a hadron may decay into two photons which can be identified by resolving the two maxima in the first layer of the LAr calorimeter. In the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.81), a presampler is used to evaluate the energy lost in the upstream material. The hadronic calorimeter, composed of scintillating tiles-iron sampling for the central part (|\u03b7| < 1.7) and of liquid-argon-copper/tungsten sampling for |\u03b7| > 1.7 is used to measure the leakage of energy of the photon candidates. A complete description of the reconstruction and identification of photons with ATLAS can be found in [8].",

This trigger is fully efficient for high mass diphoton events passing the offline selection requirements. Events are required to have at least one primary collision vertex, with at least three reconstructed T > 25 GeV and lying outside the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters. In addition, the two photons are required to satisfy standard quality criteria and to lie outside detector regions where their energy is not measured in an optimal way. The two highest E \u03b3 T photon candidates have to satisfy a set of identification requirements on the hadronic leakage and on the lateral width of the EM shower. The requirements on the EM shower use the thin granularity of the first sampling to achieve a high purity of the selected photon sample. The isolation transverse energy E iso T for each photon is calculated [8] by summing over the cells within a cone of radius \u2206R = (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3 ) 2 + (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 \u03b3 ) 2 < 0.4 around the direction of the photon. Then the energy deposit of the photon itself is subtracted as well as the soft jet activity of the underlying event [9]. In addition, E iso T is corrected for the leakage of the photon energy into the isolation ring. To further reduce the jet background, an isolation cut of E iso T < 5 GeV is applied on the two leading photons. For all events the two photons with the highest E \u03b3 T values are considered and the diphoton invariant mass has to exceed 140 GeV. A total of 6846 events are selected.",

The irreducible background uncertainty is obtained by varying the scales of the models and the PDFs in DIPHOX while the reducible background uncertainty is obtained by fitting the three control samples described in section 5 with the functionnal form. The uncertainty on the background estimation varies from \u22482% for the low mass region to \u224820% at a mass of \u22482 TeV. For the signal, the PDFs uncertainty is of 10-15% for ADD models and 5-10 % for RS models and the uncertainty on the signal yields has been evaluated to be of 6.7 % for both ADD and RS models. Figure 1 shows the observed invariant mass spectrum of diphoton events, with statistical significance of the bin-bybin difference between data and the expected background at the bottom. This difference is measured in standard deviations based on Poisson statistics. The small variations show the good agreement between data and the estimated SM background. This is confirmed by an analysis using the BUMPHUNTER [16] tool, which yields a probability of 0.28, given the background only hypothesis, to observe discrepancies as large as the one observed in the bin by bin comparison. In the absence of any significant deviation we set 95% CL on the signal cross sections, using a bayesian approach [17] with a flat prior.
