While the jet containing the D * meson originates from a charm or anticharm quark produced in the hard subprocess, the non-D * -tagged jet, referred to as other jet, can result from either the other heavy quark or a light parton (e.g. a gluon). Correlations between the two jets are studied using variables which are sensitive to higher order effects and to the longitudinal as well as to the transverse momentum components of the partons entering the hard scattering process.",

The collinear factorisation makes use of the DGLAP [7][8][9][10][11] evolution equations, while in k tfactorisation the CCFM [12][13][14][15] evolution equations are employed. In the collinear approach transverse momenta obtained through the initial state QCD evolution are neglected and the transverse momenta are generated in the hard scattering process. Effects from the non-vanishing transverse momenta of the gluons enter only at the NLO level. In the k t -factorisation ansatz the transverse momenta of incoming gluons, k t , are already included at leading order both in the off-shell matrix element and the k t -dependent unintegrated gluon density [16]. Corrections appearing only at higher order in collinear factorisation are hence partially included at LO in the k t -factorisation approach.",

PYTHIA includes both direct photon gluon fusion and resolved-photon processes. In the resolved-photon processes either a charm quark or a gluon from the photon enters the hard scattering. In the inclusive mode of PYTHIA used here charm quarks are treated as massless partons in all steps of the calculation in both types of processes. The hadronisation process is simulated using the Lund string fragmentation model [20,21]. The Bowler fragmentation model [22] is applied to fragment the charm quark into a D * meson. The longitudinal part of the fragmentation is reweighted to the parameterisation by Kartvelishvili et al. [23] which depends on a single parameter \u03b1. The latter is set to the values determined by H1 [24], which depend on the centre-of-mass energy squared of the hard subprocess\u015d (see Table 1). The proton structure is described by the PDF set CTEQ6L [25]. For the photon the PDF set GRV-G LO [26,27] is used. CASCADE: The CASCADE [28] MC program is used for simulating events based on LO QCD calculations in the k t -factorisation approach. The direct boson gluon fusion process is implemented using off-shell matrix elements and incoming gluons which can have non-vanishing transverse momenta. Higher order QCD corrections are simulated with initial state parton showers applying the CCFM evolution [12][13][14][15]. The unintegrated PDFs of the proton from set A0 [29] are used. The hadronisation of partons is performed with the Lund string model as implemented in PYTHIA. For the fragmentation of the charm quarks into D * mesons the same reweighting procedure to the parameterisation of Kartvelishvili et al. is applied as in the case of PYTHIA.",

In order to estimate the uncertainties related to missing higher orders, the renormalisation and factorisation scales are varied by a factor 2 up and down. Each variation is done independently, leading to in total 6 variations. The resulting uncertainties are added in quadrature separately for positive and negative deviations to obtain the total uncertainties. GMVFNS: A next-to-leading order cross section prediction for direct and resolved contributions to the cross section has been provided in the GMVFNS [35,36]. The transition from the charm quark to the D * meson is given by the KKKS fragmentation function which takes DGLAP evolution and finite-mass effects into account [37]. The parton contents of the proton and of the photon are described by the PDF sets HERAPDF1.0 [32] and AFG04 [38], respectively. The charm mass is set to m c = 1.5 GeV, and the renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen to be \u03bc r = \u03bc f = m T . The uncertainties related to missing higher orders are estimated by varying the renormalisation scale, the factorisation scale for the initial state and the factorisation scale for the final state independently by a factor 2 up and down while satisfying the condition that the ratio of any of the two scales is 1/2, 1 or 2. This leads to 14 independent variations. The maximum and minimum values found by this procedure are used to determine the systematic uncertainty [36]. MC@NLO: In the MC@NLO framework [39,40], predictions for heavy flavour production at HERA [41] are provided which combine an NLO calculation in the massive approach with parton showers and hadronisation. The direct and resolved part of the cross section are calculated separately. MC@NLO uses parton showers with angular ordering to simulate higher order contributions and the cluster fragmentation as implemented in HERWIG [42]. A factor of 1.34 is applied to the MC@NLO predictions in order to correct the c \u2192 D * branching fraction in HER-WIG to the experimental value [43]. The PDF sets HERA-PDF1.0 [32] for the proton and GRV-G HO [26,27] for the photon are used. For an estimation of the uncertainty, the charm mass and the renormalisation and factorisation scales are varied separately, and the resulting uncertainties are added in quadrature.",

The CTD comprises two large cylindrical jet chambers (inner CJC1 and outer CJC2) and the silicon vertex detector [46,47]. The CJCs are separated by a drift chamber which improves the z coordinate reconstruction. A multiwire proportional chamber mainly used for triggering [48] is situated inside the CJC1. These detectors are arranged concentrically around the interaction region in a solenoidal magnetic field of 1.16 T. The trajectories of the charged particles are measured with a transverse momentum resolution of \u03c3 (p T )/p T \u2248 0.5 % p T /GeV\u22951.5 % [49]. The CJCs also provide a measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss dE/dx of charged particles. The interaction vertex is reconstructed from CTD tracks. The CTD also provides trigger information based on track segments measured in the CJCs [50,51]. At the first two levels of this fast track trigger (FTT) tracks are reconstructed online from the track segments in the CJCs. At the third level of the FTT invariant masses of combinations of tracks are calculated [52,53].",

For the signal which has a tail towards larger M values the asymmetric Crystal Ball function [62] is used. The shape of the background is parametrised with the Granet function [63]. The fit is performed in the RooFit framework [64]. The fit to the inclusive data sample yields 8232 \u00b1 164 D * mesons.

To prevent the decay particles of the D * candidate from being attributed to different jets, the D * candidate is used as a single particle in the jet algorithm, replacing its decay products. In this way the jet containing the D * meson (D * jet) is unambiguously defined for each D * candidate.

For all measured quantities the precision of the measurement presented here is much better than the estimated uncertainty of the NLO calculations. The uncertainty of the NLO predictions is dominated by the variation of the renormalisation scale \u03bc r , which has a large effect on the absolute cross section, while the differences in the shapes tend to be smaller. Within these large theoretical uncertainties, both the FMNR and GMVFNS predictions agree with the measured cross section as a function of p T (D * ), while the MC@NLO underestimates the data at small p T (D * ). The p T (D * ) shape is best described by the GMVFNS calculation, while FMNR and MC@NLO predict a harder spectrum than observed in data as can be seen in the ratio Fig. 6 Single differential cross section for D * -tagged dijet production as a function of p T and \u03b7 of the D * jet and the other jet compared to PYTHIA and CASCADE predictions. The normalised ratio R norm (see text) is also shown R norm . The underestimation of the low p T (D * ) region by the central FMNR and MC@NLO predictions results in a low normalisation in the other distributions.

All three NLO calculations give a rather precise prediction of the shape of the W \u03b3p distribution, which describes the measurement.

            "text": "The integrated D * -tagged dijet cross section in the visible range given in Table 3 is measured to be The corresponding predictions from PYTHIA, CASCADE and MC@NLO amount to 8.9 nb, 8.1 nb and 7.1 +2.5 \u22121.8 nb, respectively. In the common range of transverse momentum, p T (D * ) > 2.1 GeV, the ratio of the D * -tagged dijet to the inclusive D * cross section is 0.304 \u00b1 0.013 \u00b1 0.031, compared to 0.271 and 0.311 for PYTHIA and CASCADE, respectively. MC@NLO predicts a ratio of 0.309 +0.019 \u22120.040 . The bin averaged differential cross section for the D *tagged dijet production as a function of the transverse momentum p T and the pseudorapidity \u03b7 of both the D * jet and the other jet are listed in Table 7 and shown in Figs. 6 and 7. On average, the other jet is more forward than the D * jet not only due to the larger measurement range in \u03b7, but also within the common region of \u22121.5 < \u03b7 < 1.5. This behaviour is consistent with the expectation that the other jet originates not always from a charm quark. This observation confirms the result of the previous H1 analysis of D *tagged dijet photoproduction [3] with improved precision. In Fig. 6 the measurements are compared to the PYTHIA and the CASCADE predictions. The shapes of the distributions are described well by both models. In Fig. 7 the measurements are compared to the predictions of MC@NLO. At low transverse momenta of both the D * jet and the other jet, the predictions lie significantly below the measurement. This results in a smaller total visible cross section which is also observed in the \u03b7 distribution. The uncertainty band of the MC@NLO prediction includes both variation of the charm mass and variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales as described in Sect. 2.",

The correlation between the jets in the longitudinal and transverse directions is experimentally assessed by the difference in pseudorapidity \u03b7 = \u03b7(other jet) \u2212 \u03b7(D * jet) and in the azimuthal angle | \u03d5| between the D * jet and the other jet. The amount of QCD radiation in addition to the two leading jets is investigated using the mass variable M X = (P + q \u2212 (j 1 + j 2 )) 2 with P , q, j 1 and j 2 being the four-vectors of the initial proton, the exchanged photon, the D * jet and the other jet, respectively. In direct photon processes without radiation, M X is expected to be close to the proton mass, whereas resolved processes as well as additional QCD radiation will increase M X . The fraction x \u03b3 of the longitudinal photon momentum entering the hard scattering process can be used to distinguish direct and resolved processes: in collinear factorisation at LO a resolved photon process is characterised by x \u03b3 < 1, while a direct process has x \u03b3 = 1.

The cross section as a function of \u03b7 is not symmetric because the other jet is on average more forward than the D * jet. The shape in \u03b7 is reasonably well described by all QCD calculations. The cross section as a function of | \u03d5| shows a significant contribution away from the back-to-back configuration at | \u03d5| 180 \u2022 . Such a configuration can be described by models which include significant contributions from higher order QCD radiation or a transverse momentum of the gluon in the initial state. Whereas PYTHIA predicts a too small relative contribution of these configurations, CASCADE overestimates them. The prediction from MC@NLO, shown in Fig. 9(b), agrees well in shape with the measurement. The cross section as a function of the invariant mass M X is reasonably well described by the predictions of CASCADE and PYTHIA in the region of M X < 120 GeV, whereas the measured cross section is larger than the predictions for the highest M X bin. The large M X region is correlated with the region of small x \u03b3 , where also the predictions are below the measurement.
