The observatory design allows for relocation from one site to another. Positioning the observatory some 60 km distant from a nuclear reactor complex enables precision measurement of neutrino mixing parameters, leading to a determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and \u03b8 13 . At a mid-Pacific location the observatory measures the flux of uranium and thorium decay series anti neutrinos from earth's mantle and performs a sensitive search for a hypothetical natural fission reactor in earth's core. A subsequent deployment at another mid-ocean location would test lateral heterogeneity of uranium and thorium in earth's mantle. These measurements have significance for earth energy studies.",

The observatory records interactions of electron antineutrinos of E \u03bd >1.8 MeV by inverse \u03b2-decay in a monolithic cylindrical detector of 10 kt of ultra-pure scintillating liquid. An outer surface array of inward-looking 10inch photomultiplier tubes in 13-inch glass pressure housings collects scintillation photons. An energy resolution of 3.5%/\u221aE vis results, with E vis =E \u03bd -0.8 MeV the visible energy. Sufficient overburden, adequate shielding, and radio-pure detector components limit background to negligible levels providing very high detection efficiency. The observatory does not accurately measure the direction of antineutrinos.",

The experiment utilizes a near detector at the reactor complex for normalizing flux and cross section with a far detector at the first minimum of survival probability. There is agreement that an exposure of 60 GW-kt-y of a far detector at a distance of ~60 km yields an uncertainty of 2% in the value of sin 2 (\u03b8 12 ) at the 68% confidence level, assuming a detector systematic uncertainty of 4% or less. This experiment is analogous to methods proposed for precision measurement of the sub-dominant mixing angle \u03b8 13 [9], namely the reactor antineutrino flux sampling defines one-half cycle of the oscillating survival probability. The difference is the distance of the first minimum of survival probability, which is ~2 km for the \u03b8 13 measurement.",

            "text": "The existence of a detector with the capabilities of Hanohano and the location deep inside the ocean offers an opportunity for several exciting discoveries. Here we indicate some of them briefly. One is a search for an anti-neutrino signal from relic supernovae from the distant past. The signal can be as large as 4 events per year [24]. Of course, the signal from a galactic supernova is much more robust: about 2000 conventional anti-electron neutrino capture events, with additional charged current events from 12 N, 12 B, and neutral current events from scattering on electrons and 12 C. There are also about 2000 events of elastic scattering on protons. This would be a signal in addition and complimentary to those from all other detectors around the world.",

The signal from pep+CNO in the window of 0.8 to 1.3 MeV is expected to be about 150 events/day/10kt. This is detectable against an expected background of about 130 events/day/10kt, mostly from 11 C. This is very useful in confirming the conventionally accepted neutrino parameters and to rule out some non-standard neutrino properties [25].",

A one-year deployment ~60 km distant from a nuclear reactor complex measures sin 2 (\u03b8 12 ) to 2%. This measurement requires a dedicated near detector. The same deployment measures \u03b4m 2 31 and determines neutrino mass hierarchy for sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 )>0.05 without a near detector. A one-year deployment near Hawaii measures the flux of U and Th geoneutrinos from the mantle to 25% and either measures or severely constrains the power of the hypothetical geo-reactor. Studies, laboratory work and field tests are underway.",
