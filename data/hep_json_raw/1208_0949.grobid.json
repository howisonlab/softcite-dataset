The data represent the complete sample recorded in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity of 4:7 fb \u00c01 . No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Gluino masses below 860 GeV and squark masses below 1320 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level in simplified models containing only squarks of the first two generations, a gluino octet and a massless neutralino, for squark or gluino masses below 2 TeV, respectively. Squarks and gluinos with equal masses below 1410 GeV are excluded. In minimal supergravity/constrained minimal supersymmetric Standard Model models with tan \u00bc 10, A 0 \u00bc 0 and > 0, squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded for masses below 1360 GeV. Constraints are also placed on the parameter space of supersymmetric models with compressed spectra. These limits considerably extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements with the ATLAS detector.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) include heavy colored particles, some of which could be accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. The squarks and gluinos of supersymmetric (SUSY) theories [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] form one class of such particles. This paper presents a new ATLAS search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing only jets and large missing transverse momentum. Interest in this final state is motivated by the large number of R-parity conserving models, including minimal supergravity (MSUGRA)/constrained minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) scenarios [11][12][13][14][15], in which squarksq and gluinosg can be produced in pairs (fgg;qq;qgg) and can generate the final state of interest through their direct (q ! q 0 1 andg ! q \" q 0 1 ) and cascade decays to weakly interacting neutralinos 0 1 , which escape the detector unseen. ''Squark'' here refers only to the superpartners of the four light-flavor quarks. The analysis presented here is based on a study of final states which are reconstructed as purely hadronic. Events with reconstructed electrons or muons are vetoed to avoid overlap with a related ATLAS search [16] that requires them. The term ''leptons'' is therefore used in this paper to refer only to reconstructed electrons and muons and does not include leptons. Compared to previous studies [17], this updated analysis uses the full data set (4:7 fb \u00c01 ) recorded at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV in 2011 and extends the sensitivity of the search by selecting final state topologies with higher jet multiplicities. The search strategy is optimized for maximum discovery reach in the \u00f0mg; mq\u00de plane (where mg, mq are the gluino and squark masses, respectively) for a range of models. This includes a simplified model in which all other supersymmetric particles, except for the lightest neutralino, are given masses beyond the reach of the LHC. Although interpreted in terms of SUSY models, the main results of this analysis (the data and expected background event counts in the signal regions) are relevant for constraining any model of new physics that predicts the production of jets in association with missing transverse momentum.",

The requirements used to select jets and leptons (which are referred to as physics objects) are chosen to give sensitivity to a broad range of SUSY models. In order to achieve maximal reach over the (mg, mq) plane, six analysis channels are defined. Squarks typically generate at least one jet in their decays, for instance throughq ! q 0 1 , while gluinos typically generate at least two jets, for instance throughg ! q \" q 0 1 .

The dominant sources are: W \u00fe jets, Z \u00fe jets, top quark pair, single top quark, diboson and multijet production. The majority of the W \u00fe jets background is composed of W ! events, or W ! e, events in which no electron or muon candidate is reconstructed. The largest part of the Z \u00fe jets background comes from the irreducible component in which Z ! \" decays generate large E miss T . Top quark pair production followed by semileptonic decays, in particular t \" t ! b \" bqq 0 with the lepton decaying hadronically, as well as single top quark events, can also generate large E miss T and pass the jet and lepton requirements at a non-negligible rate. The multijet background in the signal regions is caused by poor reconstruction of jet energies in the calorimeters leading to apparent missing transverse momentum, as well as by neutrino production in semileptonic decays of heavy quarks. Extensive validation of the MC simulation against data has been performed for each of these background sources and for a wide variety of control regions (CRs).",

The CR selections are optimized to maintain adequate statistical weight, while minimizing as far as possible the systematic uncertainties arising from extrapolation to the SR, and any contamination from signal events.

The detailed trigger specification, including the value of the E miss T threshold, varied throughout the data-taking period, partly as a consequence of the rapidly increasing LHC luminosity. The trigger threshold on the missing transverse momentum increased from 45 GeVat the start of the data-taking period to 55 GeV at the end. The trigger reached its full efficiency of >98% for events with a reconstructed jet with p T exceeding 130 GeV and more than 160 GeV of missing transverse momentum.

Further criteria are applied which require that the fractional energy deposited in each calorimeter layer, and in any cells with known quality problems, is consistent with that expected from beam-beam events. In addition, the energy observed in charged particle tracks associated with the calorimeter cluster and the timing of the energy depositions in calorimeter cells with respect to the beam-crossing time are checked [53].

Coupled with the explicit requirement on m eff \u00f0incl:\u00de discussed below this equates to a hard selection on E miss T . The E miss T =m eff value used decreases with increasing jet multiplicity because the typical E miss T of SUSY signal events is inversely correlated with jet multiplicity due to phase-space limitations. This is because additional jets in a SUSY decay chain increase the probability that the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) will be produced with low momentum through effective multibody decays. Small mass splittings can also lead to low E miss T . The multijet cross section is also suppressed at higher jet multiplicities, allowing the E miss T requirement to be loosened.",

However, the large cross section for this process could potentially compensate for the low acceptance and hence lead to significant SR contamination. These two effects also limit the applicability of conventional MC simulation techniques; firstly because very large MC data samples are required and secondly because accurate modeling of the acceptance requires exceptionally detailed understanding of the performance of every component of the calorimeters. For this reason a data-driven method is used to estimate the multijet background in the SRs. The method makes use of high-statistics samples of well-measured data multijet events to minimize statistical uncertainties. In order to determine the acceptance of the SRs for poorly measured multijet events, the jets in these events are convoluted with a function modeling the response of the calorimeters. This response function is based upon the results of MC simulations but is modified in such a way as to give good agreement between multijet estimates and data in two additional dedicated analyses.

When the lepton is a hadronically decaying tau, the behavior lies between these two extremes, with the hadrons being seen as jet activity and the neutrino as missing momentum. In order to be consistent between the electron and muon channels, and to use one high-statistics control region each for top quark and W events, the choice is made to model all leptons as jets. This is justified by the fact that the majority of the background comes from hadronic -decay events, for which the behavior of the lepton is more jetlike than E miss T -like. It should be noted that this choice does not bias the background estimate because identical procedures are applied to data and to MC simulation events used to construct the transfer factors.

However, in these variants, the sparticle content is augmented by an additional intermediate chargino with mass between the strongly interacting sparticle and the LSP. This allows for production of additional jets or leptons and enriches the phenomenology. In the squark pair-production case, only left-handed squarks of the first and second generations are considered in order to enhance the branching ratios of decay chains incorporating an intermediate chargino. The cross sections have been reduced by 50% to take this situation properly into account. Two different parameterizations of the masses are shown. Figures 13(a) and 14(a) vary the squark/gluino mass and the LSP mass, keeping the chargino mass exactly midway between those two. In Figs. 13(b) and 14(b), the LSP mass is instead held fixed, with the ratio of the chargino-LSP mass splitting to the squark/gluino-LSP mass splitting defining the y axis.
