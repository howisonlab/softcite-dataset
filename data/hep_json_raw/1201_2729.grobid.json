For a thinner-THGEM of thickness 0.2 mm, with hole diameter 0.2 mm, pitch 0.2 mm and narrow (5-10 \u03bcm) rim, the performance of gain versus high voltage with different gas mixtures have been studied using 5.9 keV X-rays. In general, a gain of around 3\u00d710 3 was obtained with a single board in Ar/iC 4 H 10, and gains higher than 10 4 were obtained in Ne mixture at lower voltage. The dependence of the energy resolution on the drift and induction electric fields was measured and an energy resolution of 15.9% was obtained. A curved thinner-THGEM chamber with one-dimensional readout has been assembled for use in the diffraction studies at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). A cosmic-ray muon hodoscope based on thinner-THGEM was developed as a teaching experiment for the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (GUCAS).",

            "text": "More than eighteen types of THGEMs have been produced and studied at the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (GUCAS) and the Institute for High Energy Physics (IHEP). Two sets of THGEM of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm thickness respectively were designed and built for studying the dependence of gas gain on different hole diameters. The schematic layouts of these THGEMs are shown in Figure 1. Each THGEM had four sectors, each sector having different hole diameters as follows: 300 \u03bcm (b), 400 \u03bcm (a), 500 \u03bcm (d), 600 \u03bcm (c). All holes on the four sectors had the same 1 mm pitch. Each sector had the same active area of 3\u00d74 cm 2 .   Irradiated with a 55 Fe X-ray source, the gas of the THGEM detector is ionized. The ionized electrons in the upper drift region are drifted toward the THGEM and multiplied in the THGEM holes, and then enter the lower inductive region. Finally, the electrons are collected by the anode. All electrodes were biased with CAEN SY127 HV power supplies and the signal was recorded using an ORTEC 142 preamplifier (charge sensitivity 1V/pC) followed by an ORTEC 450 amplifier (shaping time \u03c4=0.5 \u03bcs) and an ORTEC 916 multi-channel analyzer (MCA). The THGEM was mounted on a polyethylene (PE) frame and installed in a gas-tight epoxy-made chamber, which was continuously flushed with 1 atm of pre-mixed gas Ar/CO 2 / CH 4 (89/10/1). We define the maximum applied voltage as the one where the discharge rate reaches the rate of one every 30 seconds.",

Each detector has two cascaded thinner-THGEM boards with an effective area of 50\u00d750 mm 2 . The effective gain is related to the appropriate voltages applied to the THGEM, based on our previous studies. The electric fields of the detector were selected as follows: the drift electric field (E drift ) of 0.35 kV/cm, the transfer electric field (E tran ) of 3 kV/cm, the induction electric field (E ind ) of 3.3 kV/cm, and the voltage of both cascaded thinner-THGEMs (\u2206V THGEM ) of 500 V, giving a gas gain of the detector 3\u00d710 4 in Ar/iC 4 H 10 (95/3).",

The data acquisition and processing software were written using KEIL-C++ software for SCM and LabVIEW for online display and data analysis. The display screen was designed as follows: when any of the 32 pads, either the upper 16 or lower 16, is hit by a cosmic ray muon, a spot is displayed. When a muon passes through both upper and lower detectors simultaneously, a track line is displayed through these two pads on the computer screen, as shown in Figure 13. ",

The experimental results show that the energy resolution depends strongly on the drift electric field. The thinner-THGEM has been used successfully in X-ray diffraction and muon hodoscope experiments.",

Finally, the electrons are collected by the anode. All electrodes were biased with CAEN SY127 HV power supplies and the signal was recorded using an ORTEC 142 preamplifier (charge sensitivity 1V/pC) followed by an ORTEC 450 amplifier (shaping time \u03c4=0.5 \u03bcs) and an ORTEC 916 multi-channel analyzer (MCA).
