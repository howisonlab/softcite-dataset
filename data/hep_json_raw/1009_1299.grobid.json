Lorentz violation can then be described by the single-flavor QED limit of the flatspacetime mSME. 2,5 In this framework, photons have a modified dispersion relation:",

Due to their energy loss, scattered electrons are extracted from the main beam in the magnetic dipole following the straight section. Their position can then be accurately measured in the so-called tagging system located 50 cm after the exit of the dipole. This system is composed of a position-sensitive Si \u00b5-strip detector (128 strips of 300 \u00b5m pitch, 500 \u00b5m thick) associated to a set of fast plastic scintillators. A typical Si \u00b5-strip count spectrum near the CE is shown in Fig. 1 for the multiline UV mode (364, 351, 333 nm) of the laser used in this measurement. The fitting function, also plotted, is based on the sum of 3 error functions plus background and includes 6 free parameters. The CE position (location of the central line), x CE , can be measured with an excellent resolution of \u223c 3 \u00b5m. A sample of the time series of the CE positions relative to the ESRF beam covering 24 h is displayed in Fig. 2c, along with the tagging-box temperature ( Fig. 2b) and the ESRF beam intensity (Fig. 2a). The sharp steps present in Fig. 2a correspond to the twice-a-day refills of the ESRF ring. The similarity of the temperature and CE spectra combined with their correlation with the ESRF beam intensity led us to interpret the continuous and slow drift of the CE positions as a result of the tagging-box dilation induced by the x-ray heat load.",
