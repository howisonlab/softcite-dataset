The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector. This determination, for the first time performed without assuming a value for the orbital angular momentum, confirms the quantum numbers to be J PC \u00bc 1 \u00fe\u00fe . The X\u00f03872\u00de is found to decay predominantly through an S wave and an upper limit of 4% at 95% C.L. is set on the D-wave contribution.",

However, the nature of this state remains unclear. The X\u00f03872\u00de state is narrow, has a mass very close to the D 0D\u00c30 threshold and decays to \u03c1 0 J=\u03c8 and \u03c9J=\u03c8 final states with comparable branching fractions [7], thus violating isospin symmetry. This suggests that the X\u00f03872\u00de particle may not be a simple cc state, and exotic states such as D 0D\u00c30 molecules [8], tetraquarks [9] or mixtures of states [10] have been proposed to explain its composition. The X\u00f03872\u00de quantum numbers, such as total angular momentum J, parity P and charge conjugation C, impose constraints on the theoretical models of this state. The orbital angular momentum L in the X\u00f03872\u00de decay may also provide information on its internal structure.",

            "text": "The choices for J PC were narrowed down to two possibilities, 1 \u00fe\u00fe or 2 \u2212\u00fe , by the CDF Collaboration, via an analysis of the angular correlations in inclusively reconstructed X\u00f03872\u00de \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 J=\u03c8 and J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 decays, dominated by prompt production in pp collisions [16]. Using 1.0 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by LHCb, J PC \u00bc 2 \u2212\u00fe was ruled out in favor of the 1 \u00fe\u00fe assignment, using the angular correlations in the same decay chain, with the X\u00f03872\u00de state produced in B \u00fe \u2192 X\u00f03872\u00deK \u00fe decays [17]. Both angular analyses assumed that the lowest orbital angular momentum between the X\u00f03872\u00de decay products (L min ) dominated the matrix element. Significant contributions from L min \u00fe 2 amplitudes could invalidate the 1 \u00fe\u00fe assignment. Since the phase-space limit on M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de is close to the \u03c1 0 pole (775.3 AE 0.3 MeV [7]), the energy release in the X\u00f03872\u00de decay, Q \u2261 M\u00f0J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u2212 M\u00f0J=\u03c8\u00de \u2212 M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de, is a small fraction of the X\u00f03872\u00de mass, making the orbital angular momentum barrier effective. 3 However, an exotic component in X\u00f03872\u00de could induce contributions from higher orbital angular momentum for models in which the size of the X\u00f03872\u00de state is substantially larger than the compact sizes of the charmonium states. Therefore, it is important to probe the X\u00f03872\u00de spin-parity without any assumptions about L. A determination of the magnitude of contributions from L min \u00fe 2 amplitudes for the correct J PC is also of interest, since a substantial value would suggest an anomalously large size of the X\u00f03872\u00de state. In this article, we extend our previous analysis [17] ",

The corresponding B LS amplitudes are listed in Table I. Values of J X up to 4 are analyzed. Since the orbital angular momentum in the B \u00fe decay equals J X , high values are suppressed by the angular momentum barrier. In fact, the highest observed spin of any resonance produced in B decays is 3 [29,30]. Since P is insensitive to the overall normalization of the B LS couplings and to the phase of the matrix element, the B LS amplitude with the lowest L and S is set to the arbitrary reference value (1,0). The set of other possible complex B LS amplitudes, which are free parameters in the fit, is denoted as \u03b1. ",

            "text": "The likelihood ratio t \u2261 \u22122 ln\u00bdL\u00f0J alt X \u00de=L\u00f01 \u00fe\u00fe \u00de is used as a test variable to discriminate between the 1 \u00fe\u00fe and alternative spin hypotheses considered (J alt X ). The values of t in the data (t data ) are positive, favoring the 1 \u00fe\u00fe assignment. They are incompatible with the distributions of t observed in experiments simulated under various J alt X hypotheses, as illustrated in Fig. 3. To quantify these disagreements we calculate the approximate significance of rejection (the p-value) of J alt X as \u00f0t data \u2212 hti\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de, where hti and \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de are the mean and rms deviations of the t distribution under the J alt X hypothesis. In all spin configurations tested, we exclude the alternative spin hypothesis with a significance of more than 16 standard deviations. Values of t in data are consistent with those expected in the 1 \u00fe\u00fe case as shown in Fig. 3, with fractions of simulated 1 \u00fe\u00fe experiments with t < t data in the 25%-91% range. Projections of the data and of the fit P onto individual angles show good consistency with the 1 \u00fe\u00fe assignment as illustrated in Fig. 4. Inconsistency with the other assignments is apparent when correlations between various angles are exploited. For example, the data projection onto cos \u03b8 X is consistent only with the 1 \u00fe\u00fe fit projection after requiring j cos \u03b8 \u03c1 j > 0.6 (see Fig. 5), while inconsistency with the other quantum number assignments is less clear without the cos \u03b8 \u03c1 requirement.",

By requiring Q < 0.1 GeV, the background level is reduced by more than a factor of 2, while losing only 20% of the signal. By tightening the requirements on the p T of the \u03c0, K and \u03bc candidates, we decrease the signal efficiency by around 75% with a similar reduction in the background level. In all cases, the significance of the rejection of the disfavored hypotheses is compatible with that expected from the simulation. Likewise, the best fit f D values determined for these subsamples of data change within the expected statistical fluctuations and remain consistent with the upper limit we have set.",

These quantum numbers are consistent with those predicted by the molecular or tetraquark models and with the \u03c7 c1 \u00f02 3 P 1 \u00de charmonium state [32], possibly mixed with a molecule [10]. Other charmonium states are excluded. No significant D-wave fraction is found, with an upper limit of 4% at 95% C.L. The S-wave dominance is expected in the charmonium or tetraquark models, in which the X\u00f03872\u00de state has a compact size. An extended size, such as that predicted by the molecular model, implies more favorable conditions for the D wave.
