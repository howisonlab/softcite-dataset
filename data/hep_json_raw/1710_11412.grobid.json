            "text": "A search for weakly interacting massive darkmatter particles produced in association with bottom or top quarks is presented. Final states containing third-generation quarks and missing transverse momentum are considered. The analysis uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. No significant excess of events above the estimated backgrounds is observed. The results are interpreted in the framework of simplified models of spin-0 dark-matter mediators. For colour-neutral spin-0 mediators produced in association with top quarks and decaying into a pair of darkmatter particles, mediator masses below 50 GeV are excluded assuming a dark-matter candidate mass of 1 GeV and unitary couplings. For scalar and pseudoscalar mediators produced in association with bottom quarks, the search sets limits on the production cross-section of 300 times the predicted rate for mediators with masses between 10 and 50 GeV and assuming a dark-matter mass of 1 GeV and unitary coupling. Constraints on colour-charged scalar simplified models are also presented. Assuming a dark-matter particle mass of 35 GeV, mediator particles with mass below 1.1 TeV are excluded for couplings yielding a dark-matter relic density consistent with measurements.",

One of the candidates for a DM particle is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) [5]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch At the large hadron collider (LHC), one can search for WIMP DM (\u03c7 ) pair production in pp collisions. WIMP DM would not be detected and its production leads to signatures with missing transverse momentum.

            "text": "Recently proposed simplified benchmark models for DM production assume the existence of a mediator particle which couples both to the SM and to the dark sector [13][14][15]. The searches presented in this paper focus on the case of a fermionic DM particle produced through the exchange of a spin-0 mediator, which can be either a colour-neutral scalar or pseudoscalar particle (denoted by \u03c6 or a, respectively) or a colour-charged scalar mediator (\u03c6 b ). The couplings of the mediator to the SM fermions are severely restricted by precision flavour measurements. An ansatz that automatically relaxes these constraints is Minimal Flavour Violation [16]. This assumption implies that the interaction between any new neutral spin-0 state and SM matter is proportional to the fermion masses via Yukawa-type couplings. 1 It follows that colour-neutral mediators would be sizeably produced through loop-induced gluon fusion or in association with heavy-flavour quarks. The characteristic signature used to search for the former process is a high transverse momentum jet recoiling against missing transverse momentum [7,11]. This paper focuses on dark matter produced in association with heavy flavour (top and bottom) quarks. These final states were addressed by the CMS Collaboration in Ref. [17]. For signatures with two top quarks (tt + \u03c6/a), final states where both W bosons decay into hadrons or both W bosons decay into leptons are considered in this paper. They are referred to as fully hadronic and dileptonic tt decays, respectively. Searches in final-state events characterised by fully hadronic or dileptonic top-quark pairs have been carried out targeting supersymmetric partners of the top quarks [18,19] colour-neutral spin-0 mediator associated production with top quarks tt +\u03c6/a; c colour-charged scalar mediator model decaying into a bottom quark and a DM particle b-FDM different kinematics of the events under study, those searches are not optimal for the DM models considered in this paper. The search in the channel where one W boson decays into hadrons and one W boson decays into leptons (semileptonic tt decays) is presented together with the searches for top squarks in the same channel [20]. Signatures with bottom quarks in the final state are denoted bb + \u03c6/a in the following. Representative diagrams for tree-level production of these models are shown in Fig. 1a, b. Processes with similar kinematic properties might also occur in two-Higgs-doublet models [21]. Following the notation of Ref. [14], the model has four parameters: the mass of the mediator m \u03c6 or m a , the DM mass m \u03c7 , the DM-mediator coupling g \u03c7 , and the flavour-universal SM-mediator coupling g q . The mediator width is assumed to be the minimal width, which is the one calculated from the masses and couplings assumed by the model [13]. The mediator can decay into SM particles or into DM particles. This search is sensitive to decays of the mediator into a pair of DM particles. Off-shell DM production is also taken into account. The effective production crosssection of DM particles at pp colliders is a function of the production cross-section of the mediator, depending on g q , and on the branching ratio for the mediator to decay into a pair of DM particles, which is a function of g q and g \u03c7 [13]. The cross-section for DM production is therefore proportional to the squared product of the couplings (g q \u2022 g \u03c7 ) 2 , and an additional assumption of g q = g \u03c7 = g is made to reduce the number of parameters. Since the cross-section of annihilation and scattering from nucleons has the same functional dependence on the couplings, the same assumption is made when the results are compared to non-collider experiments.",

            "text": "The second category of models considered in this search is the case of colour-charged scalar mediators [22]. The model assumes bottom-flavoured dark matter (b-FDM) and was proposed to explain the excess of gamma rays from the galactic centre observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, if this excess is to be interpreted as a signal for DM annihilation [23], while alternative conjectures without DM are also discussed [24]. A representative diagram for the production of this signal is shown in Fig. 1c. In this model, a new scalar field, \u03c6 b , mediates the interaction between DM and quarks. Dark matter is assumed to be the lightest Dirac fermion that belongs to a flavour-triplet coupling to righthanded, down-type quarks. The cosmological DM is the third component of the triplet and couples preferentially to bottom quarks. It explains the galactic-centre excess if a DM mass around 35 GeV is assumed. The other Dirac fermions in the flavour-triplet are heavy and couple weakly, and are therefore neglected. The b-FDM model has three parameters: the mediator and the DM masses (m(\u03c6 b ) and m(\u03c7 ), respectively), and the coupling strength between the mediator and the DM particle, \u03bb b [22]. For each pair of mass values considered, \u03bb b is set to the value, generally larger than one, predicting a DM relic density compatible with the astrophysical observations as detailed in Ref. [22]. Strong-interaction pair production of \u03c6 b , which does not depend on the coupling, is equivalent to the pair production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark (bottom squark,b 1 ) assuming that it decays exclusively into a bottom quark and the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ). Exclusion limits on m(b 1 ), which depend on m(\u03c7 0 1 ), are set in dedicated searches by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [25,26]. The target of this search is the single production mode represented in Fig. 1(c), which can dominate the production rate of the \u03c6 b mediator due to the relatively large values assumed for \u03bb b . The parameter space considered corresponds to \u03c6 b masses of a few hundred GeV. A search by the ATLAS Collaboration with the \u221a s = 8 TeV LHC Run-1 dataset has already excluded m(\u03c6 b ) < 600 GeV for m(\u03c7 ) = 35 GeV [27].",

The inner tracking detector consists of pixel and silicon microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5, surrounded by a transition radiation tracker which provides electron identification in the region |\u03b7| < 2.0. Between Run 1 and Run 2, a new inner pixel layer, the insertable B-layer [29,30], was inserted at a mean sensor radius of 3.3 cm. The inner detector is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing an axial 2 T magnetic field and by a fine-granularity lead/liquidargon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage in the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) of the hadronic calorimeter are made of LAr active layers with either copper or tungsten as the absorber material. A muon spectrometer with an air-core toroid magnet system surrounds the calorimeters. Three stations of high-precision tracking chambers provide coverage in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, while dedicated chambers allow triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. The ATLAS trigger system consists of a hardware-based level-1 trigger followed by a software-based high-level trigger [31]. The events used in this analysis are required to pass either an online trigger requiring a minimum of two electrons, two muons or an electron and a muon, or an online missing transverse momentum trigger selection. The trigger thresholds are such that a plateau of the efficiency is reached for events passing the analysis requirements presented in Sect. 4.

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r , \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

Jets are calibrated as described in Ref.

The integrated luminosity of the combined 2015 + 2016 dataset after requiring that all detector subsystems were operational during data recording is 36.1 fb \u22121 . The uncertainty in the total integrated luminosity is 3.2%, derived following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [51]. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to aid in the estimation of the background from SM processes and to model the dark-matter signal. All simulated events were processed through an ATLAS detector simulation [52] based on Geant4 [53] or through a fast simulation using a parameterisation of the calorimeter response and Geant4 for the other parts of the detector [54]. The simulated events are reconstructed with the same reconstruction algorithms used for data. Correction factors are applied to the simulated events to compensate for differences between data and MC simulation in the b-tagging efficiencies and mis-tag rates, lepton and photon identification, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies. The MC samples are reweighted so that the pileup distribution matches the one observed in the data.",

The expected background is determined separately in each SR through a profile likelihood fit based on the HistFitter package [96]. The CR yields constrain the normalisation of the dominant SM background processes. Such normalisation factors are treated as free fit parameters and are uncorrelated between fits of different SRs. The systematic uncertainties are included as nuisance parameters in the fit. In the case of a \"background-only\" fit set-up, only the CRs are considered and the signal contribution is neglected. The number of background events predicted by simulation in the SRs is normalised according to the results of the fit. When computing exclusion limits as described in Sect. 7, the SRs are also used to constrain the background predictions. The non-dominant SM backgrounds are determined purely from MC simulation, except fake or non-prompt lepton backgrounds (arising from jets misidentified as leptons or produced in either hadron decays or photon conversions) and the multi-jet background, both of which are estimated using a data-driven method described below. The background estimates in the SRs are validated by extrapolating the results of the likelihood fit in the CRs to dedicated validation regions (VRs), which are designed to be orthogonal to both the signal and control regions.

The normalisation factors for tt processes in the SRtX regions are found to be compatible with unity, while they are found to be considerably smaller than unity for SRb2.

The uncertainty connected with the parton-shower modelling is estimated as the difference between the predictions from Powheg showered with Pythia or Herwig. Additionally, the uncertainty  related to the choice of event generator is evaluated by comparing the Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO predictions [55] for SRb1, SRb2 and SRt3.

For SRt1 and SRt2 an additional uncertainty is included to account for effects on the R bb modelling not captured by the scale variations. This is estimated as the difference between the observed yield in data and the post-fit background prediction plus one times its uncertainty in each of the VRZs.

Table 6 summarises the contributions from the different sources of systematic uncertainty in the total SM background predictions for the different signal regions after the fit to the control regions described in Sect. 5. As can be seen, the contribution from the theoretical uncertainty in the tt background and the contribution from the statistical uncertainty connected with the use of Monte Carlo simulations are higher in SRt1 than in SRt2. The reason for the higher contribution from the theoretical uncertainty in the tt background is primarily due to the larger relative importance of this source of background in SRt1.

To derive the results for the fully hadronic tt final state the region SRt1 or SRt2 providing the better expected sensitivity is used  For each dark-matter and mediator mass pair, the exclusion limit on the production cross-section of colour-neutral scalar mediator particles can be converted into a limit on the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross-section using the procedure described in Ref. [109]. The results can thus be compared with the results from direct-detection experiments. The most stringent limits, provided by SRt3, are used for this purpose. Figure 7 shows the constraints from this analysis expressed as exclusion limits at 90% CL in the plane defined by the dark-matter mass and the scattering cross-section. The black line indicates the exclusion contour derived from the observed limits in the top part of Fig. 5, where mediator masses between 10 GeV and 500 GeV are considered. The maximum value of the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section displayed corresponds to the result obtained for a mediator mass of 10 GeV. The results of this analysis are compared with the results from the LUX [104], PandaX-II [105], XENON [106], SuperCDMS [107] and  experiments. The comparison is model-dependent, and therefore valid only for the specific models considered in this paper. For pseudoscalar mediator models, the predicted dark-matter cross-sections in these direct-detection experiments is suppressed by velocity-dependent terms. As a result, direct-detection limits on spin-independent DMnucleon scattering cross-section are several orders of magnitude worse than the ones obtained in this analysis, and therefore not presented.",

For a DM particle of approximately 35 GeV, as suggested by the interpretation of data recorded by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration, mediator masses below 1.1 TeV are excluded at 95% CL.",

            "text": "This article reports a search for dark-matter pair production in association with bottom or top quarks. The analysis is performed using 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The results are interpreted in the framework of simplified models of spin-0 mediators to the dark sector decaying into pairs of DM particles. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and limits are set on the signal strength for a coupling assumption of g = 1.0 or on the DM and mediator masses. The results represent the most stringent limits to date for colourneutral spin-0 mediator models for a DM mass assumption of 1 GeV in top-quark final states. It excludes at 95% CL mediator masses between 10 and 50 GeV for scalar mediators assuming couplings equal to unity and a dark-matter mass of 1 GeV. Although the analysis is expected to be sensitive to models with pseudoscalar mediators with masses between 10 and 100 GeV, no observed exclusion limit can be set for this model for the coupling assumption of g = 1.0 because of a small excess in the observed data. Limits of times the nominal cross section for couplings equal to unity are placed for scalar and pseudoscalar mediator masses between 10 and 50 GeV for a dark-matter mass of 1 GeV in bottom-quark final states. Constraints on b-FDM models are also presented. The excluded region depends on m(\u03c6 b ) and m(\u03c7 ); for m(\u03c7 ) = 35 GeV, mediator particles with m(\u03c6) < 1.1 TeV are excluded. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
