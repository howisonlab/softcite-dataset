In particular, the photon from the b is predominantly left handed in the SM, whereas additional right handed currents can arise in certain new physics models, such as the Left-Right symmetric models, or in some supersymmetric models [1]. Access to the polarisation information is available via an angular analysis of B \u2192 K * e + e \u2212 .",

            "text": "Hadronic form factors render theoretical prediction over the whole q 2 (the dilepton invariant mass squared) range difficult. However, it has been shown that these uncertainties are controllable at low q 2 , where the photon term dominates, and certain asymmetries providing information on the photon polarisation can be formed. [2] 2 B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 status at LHCb With 309 pb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s=7 TeV, collected in three months during the first half of 2011, the forward backward asymmetry of the dilepton system, A FB has been measured [3] using B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events, (as is shown in Fig. 2), along with F L , the K * longitudinal polarisation (Fig. 2); an input required for the photon polarisation measurement. These observables have been measured as being in good agreement with SM predictions, [4], implying a SM like Wilson Coefficient C 7 , but still allowing for the existence of C 7 (right handed currents). As stressed above, the measurement is most sensitive at low q 2 . It would therefore be preferable to perform the analysis using electrons. However, experimentally it is more challenging to observe electrons than muons, primarily due to the fact that muons provide a very clean signature to trigger on. With 309 pb \u22121 of LHCb data, B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 in the q 2 range 0-2 GeV has been observed, as is shown, along with other q 2 ranges, in Fig. 2. With the rest of the 2011 data, one can expect to see a B \u2192 K * e + e \u2212 signal. a e-mail: nicol@lal.in2p3.fr    Fig. 3.

Toy MC studies have therefore been carried out for this purpose [6]. 190k signal events were generated using EvtGen, and separated into files containing 250 events: the predicted yields from MC studies with 2fb \u22121 at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV, excluding effects from LHCb's high level trigger. By performing the fit on each file, it is shown that with 200-250 signal events and a signal to background ratio of the order of 1, a precision of 0.2 is attainable on A 2 T , equivalent to an accuracy on the fraction of wrongly polarised photons of 0.1. An example of one of the fits for one toy MC study can be seen in Fig. 4. The analysis also demonstrates that the measurements are not sensitive to the knowledge of the angular acceptance, and hence shall not be systematics limited. Fig. 4.
