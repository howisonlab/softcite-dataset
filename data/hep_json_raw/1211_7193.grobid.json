These are baryon asymmetry, dark matter, neutrino oscillations and others. Neutrino oscillations from short baseline experiments favor the existence of an additional neutrino mass state to the three active neutrinos in the SM. Astrophysical observations and cosmology also point to the fact that the effective number of neutrinos is greater than 3 [1]. This can be interpreted as a possible existence of at least one sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrino is a natural consequence of the non-zero neutrino mass and appears in many theories beyond the SM. From this point of view, addition of a. Would a sterile neutrino be found it will be the first particle beyond the Standard Model. While there is a number of the results which disfavor or even are in contradiction with the hypothesis of sterile neutrino, many experiments are undergoing or are planning to search for them. For details we refer to the \"Light sterile neutrinos: a white paper\" [2].",

Results of the reanalysis of our data on the direct electron antineutrino mass measurements in Tritium \u03b2-decay in the Troitsk nu-mass experiment [4] are presented in this paper. The group led by V. M. Lobashev was obtaining these data in the period of 1997-2004. We used the same file set and analysis framework as for the electron antineutrino mass. We performed a search for any sign of an additional neutrino mass state in the \u03b2-electron spectrum. Such a state with a finite mass would exhibit itself as a kink in the spectrum. Recently a similar analysis was published based on the Mainz data [3].",

Its main purpose is to filter short-timed high intensity \"bunch\" events which are caused by the electrons trapped in the spectrometer magnetic bottle. The procedure for \"bunch\" search is automatic and its effectiveness is lower for higher count rates. The count rate in the spectrometer below the spectrum endpoint by around 50 eV is usually critical for bunch rejection algorithm. The simulations show that while bunch rejection parameters cannot affect the estimation of the active neutrino mass, they do affect estimation of the probability for heavy neutrino mass above 30 eV. Our analysis is also not sensitive enough in the region of m 4 50 -100 eV because of wider intervals between the measured experimental points (around 25 eV) of electron spectrum moving away from the endpoint. In conclusion, we reanalyzed our data of the direct electron antineutrino mass measurements in Tritium \u03b2-decay in the Troitsk experiment. The file set and the analysis framework were identical to those used in the original work. The maximum likelihood method was used to evaluate a possible contribution of the heavy extra mass state m 4 with amplitude U 2 e4 with the assumption that all three active neutrinos have zero masses. In the mass range 2 < m 4 < 20 eV an upper limit at 95% C.L. quickly goes down to U 2 e4 = 0.01 and then stays close to this level for m 4 up to 100 eV .",
