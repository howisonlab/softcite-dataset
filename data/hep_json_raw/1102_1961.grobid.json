With the establishment of the decay modes presented here, future measurements can be considered that will further aid our experimental investigation into the physics of the B 0 s system. The success of the CKM threegeneration description of charge conjugation-parity inversion (CP ) violation [1] in the bottom and kaon sectors has continued to motivate additional, more precise tests of CP violation in the flavor sector. In recent years, attention has turned to the B 0 s meson as new territory to explore the possibility of non-standard-model contributions, specifically in the CKM matrix element V ts . Precise measurement of the frequency of B 0 s flavor oscillations [2] has significantly limited the magnitude of new physics amplitudes. However, possible large new physics phases remain poorly constrained.",

The CDF II detector is a general purpose, cylindrically symmetric detector. A more detailed description can be found elsewhere [7]. The sub-detectors relevant for these analyses are briefly discussed here. Charged particle trajectories (tracks) are measured by a system comprised of eight layers of silicon microstrip detector (SVX) and an open-cell wire drift chamber (COT), both immersed in a 1.4 T axial magnetic field. The silicon detector [8] extends from a radius of 1.5 cm to 22 cm and has a single-hit resolution of approximately 15 \u00b5m. The COT drift chamber [9] provides up to 96 measurements from radii of 40 cm to 137 cm and covers the range |\u03b7| \u22641 [10]. The combined COT+SVX charged particle momentum resolution is \u03c3 pT /p T 2 = 0.07% [GeV/c ] \u22121 , which leads to a mass resolution on the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 signal of 0.006 GeV/c 2 . Outside the calorimeters reside four layers of planar drift chambers [11] (CMU) that detect muons with transverse momentum p T >1.4 GeV/c within |\u03b7| < 0.6. Additional chambers and scintillators [12] (CMX) cover 0.6< |\u03b7| <1.0 for muons with p T >2 GeV/c.",

The reconstruction of K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates starts from pairs of oppositely-charged tracks fit to a common interaction point (vertex).

We model the signal contributions with templates composed of three Gaussians obtained from fits to B 0 MC. The two dominant, narrow Gaussians model detector resolution effects and also account for cases where the identities of the \u03c0 and K from the K * 0 decay are interchanged. As mentioned above, some events are identified where a single pair of tracks pass the selection requirements under both the \u03c0-K and K-\u03c0 hypotheses. In those cases, we reconstruct the event using both sets of \u03c0/K assignments and then choose candidate whose particle assignment yields a reconstructed mass that is closer to the nominal K * (892) mass. This technique ensures that candidates are not used twice. Approximately 10% of B \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 events are reconstructed with the incorrect \u03c0-K assignment. These events peak at the B masses, but have a significantly broader width. A wide Gaussian models misreconstructed signal events and other non-Gaussian resolution effects. The relative contributions, means, and widths of each Gaussian are fixed in the fit. The B 0 s templates used in the fit are identical to B 0 templates, except for a shift of 86.8 MeV/c 2 in the mean value of the three Gaussians. This value corresponds to the known [3,20] mass difference between B 0 s and B 0 . The MC slightly underestimates the mass resolution, so the widths of the two narrow Gaussians are multiplied by a scale factor common to the B 0 and B 0 s templates, which is allowed to float in the fit. The scale factor is not applied to the third Gaussian since the resolution effects are negligible compared to the other effects. Moreover, a common mass shift is added to the means of all Gaussian templates to account for a possible mass mismodeling in the MC. This mass shift is floating in the fit. The B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 analysis has three primary background contributions: events with random track combinations (combinatorics), partially reconstructed b hadrons, and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decays. Combinatorial background arises from sources such as a real J/\u03c8 plus two other tracks, where the J/\u03c8 could be either prompt or coming from a B decay. Another source arises from false J/\u03c8 candidates reconstructed from misidentified hadrons. The combinatorial background is non-peaking and accurately modeled in the fit with an exponential function.",

            "text": "For the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 analysis, the procedure to evaluate the systematic uncertainty is slightly different. The B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decay is an unknown admixture of CP -even and CP -odd states which have different lifetimes. The world-average currently gives \u2206\u0393 B 0 s /\u0393 B 0 s = 0.092 +0.051 \u22120.054 for \u0393 B 0 s = 1 2 (\u0393 B 0 sH + \u0393 B 0 sL ) [3], where \u0393 B 0 sH and \u0393 B 0 sL are the widths of the heavy and light mass eigenstates respectively. If the B 0 s were either all B 0 sH or B 0 sL , the maximum lifetime change would be 5%. To evaluate the effect on A rel , we reweight the default B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 lifetime distribution. The reweighting is performed by normalizing the default lifetime distribution and comparing it to distributions with the lifetime increased or decreased by 5%. This leads to a maximum deviation on A rel of 0.046.",

Since we normalize our B 0 s signal to the B 0 mode, we are sensitive only to mismodeling in the ratio of p T (B 0 ) versus p T (B 0 s ), which should be quite small. We compare the default B 0 s and B 0 samples which use a next-to-leading order QCD calculation [15] to the p T spectrum measured by CDF [7]. In the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 analysis, the value of A rel varies by 0.029 when using these alternative production spectra and we take this value as a systematic uncertainty. Likewise, for the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S analysis, the change in A rel is 0.032.",

Since we have no a priori knowledge of the actual polarization in the B 0 s mode, we compute the systematic uncertainty by allowing all possible values for the polarization. We generated MC samples for A 0 = 1, A = 1, and A \u22a5 = 1. The maximum variation from any of these polarizations leads to a systematic uncertainty on A rel of 0.261. Since the angular distributions arising from polarization are clearly the dominant systematic uncertainty, we have neglected the correlation between polarization and lifetime in assessing the uncertainties. Table IV shows a summary of the systematic uncertainties on A rel for both measurements. Summing these contributions in quadrature, we find A rel = 1.057 \u00b1 0.010 (stat) \u00b1 0.267 (syst) for the K * 0 analysis and A rel = 1.012 \u00b1 0.010 (stat) \u00b1 0.042 (syst) for the K 0 S analysis.",
