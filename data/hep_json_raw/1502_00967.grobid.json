            "text": "Combined constraints from the CDF and D0 Collaborations on models of the Higgs boson with exotic spin J and parity P are presented and compared with results obtained assuming the standard model value J P \u00bc 0 \u00fe . Both collaborations analyzed approximately 10 fb \u22121 of proton-antiproton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV collected at the Fermilab Tevatron. Two models predicting exotic Higgs bosons with J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 and J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe are tested. The kinematic properties of exotic Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson differ from those predicted for the standard model Higgs boson. Upper limits at the 95% credibility level on the production rates of the exotic Higgs bosons, expressed as fractions of the standard model Higgs boson production rate, are set at 0.36 for both the J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 hypothesis and the J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe hypothesis. If the production rate times the branching ratio to a bottom-antibottom pair is the same as that predicted for the standard model Higgs boson, then the exotic bosons are excluded with significances of 5.0 standard deviations and 4.9 standard deviations for the J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 and J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe hypotheses, respectively. The Higgs boson discovered by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] Collaborations in 2012 using data produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN allows many stringent tests of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model (SM) and extensions to the SM to be performed. To date, measurements of the Higgs boson's mass and width [3][4][5][6], its couplings to other particles [3,[7][8][9][10][11], and its spin and parity quantum numbers J and P [10][11][12][13][14][15][16]  (H \u2192 bb) [17,18]. The Tevatron data are also consistent with the predictions for the properties of the SM Higgs boson [18][19][20][21][22].",

            "text": "The authors of Ref. [23] proposed to use the Tevatron data to test models for the Higgs boson with exotic spin and parity, using events in which the exotic Higgs boson X is produced in association with a W or a Z boson and decays to a bottom-antibottom quark pair X \u2192 bb. This proposal used two of the spin and parity models in Ref. [24], one with a pseudoscalar J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 state and the other with a gravitonlike J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe state. For the SM Higgs boson, which has J P \u00bc 0 \u00fe , the differential production rate near threshold is linear in \u03b2, where \u03b2 \u00bc 2p= ffiffi f s p , p is the momentum of the X boson in the VX (V \u00bc W or Z) reference frame, and ffiffi f s p is the total energy of the VX system in its rest frame. For the pseudoscalar model, the dependence is proportional to \u03b2 3 . For the gravitonlike model, the dependence is proportional to \u03b2 5 ; however, not all J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe models share this \u03b2 5 factor [23]. These powers of \u03b2 alter the kinematic distributions of the observable decay products of the vector boson and the Higgs-like boson X, most notably the invariant mass of the VX system, which has a higher average value in the J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 hypothesis than in the SM 0 \u00fe case and higher still in the J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe hypothesis. These models predict neither the production rates nor the decay branching fractions of the X particles. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations recently reported strong evidence for Higgs boson decays to fermions [25][26][27][28][29][30], with sensitivity dominated by the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u00fe \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode, though they have not yet performed spin and parity tests using fermionic decays. The particle decaying fermionically for which the Tevatron also found evidence might not be the same as the particle discovered through its bosonic decays at the LHC. Tests of the spin and parity [23] with Tevatron data therefore provide unique information on the identity and properties of the new particle or particles. The CDF and D0 Collaborations have reoptimized their SM Higgs boson searches to test the exotic Higgs boson models in the WH \u2192 l\u03bdbb [31,32], ZH \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 bb [33,34], and WH \u00fe ZH \u2192E T bb [35,36] channels, where l \u00bc e or \u03bc and E T is the missing transverse energy [37]. In this Letter, we report a combination of the CDF [21] and D0 [22] studies of the J P assignments of the state X, with mass m X \u00bc 125 GeV/c 2 , in the X \u2192 bb decay.",

The single top quark production cross section is assumed to be 3.15 AE 0.31 pb [54]. For details of the generators used, see Ref. [55]. Data-driven methods are used to normalize the V plus light-flavor and heavy-flavor jet backgrounds [60] using V data events containing no b-tagged jets [61], which have negligible signal content [62,63].

Events are classified into separate categories based on the quality of the identified lepton. Separate categories are used for events with a high-quality muon or central electron candidate, an isolated track, or a forward electron candidate. Within the lepton categories, five exclusive b-tag categories, comprising two single-tag and three double-tag categories, are formed. The multivariate b tagger used by CDF [64] was trained on SM Higgs boson signal MC events. Few of these events contained jets with transverse energy E T > 200 GeV, and thus, the tagger does not perform well for such jets. Hence, only jets with E T < 200 GeV are considered. For the D0 WH \u2192 l\u03bdbb analysis, events are selected with two or three jets. The data are split by lepton flavor and jet multiplicity (two or three jet subchannels) and by the output of the b-tagging algorithm applied to all selected jets in the event. This channel, along with the other two D0 channels, uses a multivariate b-tagging algorithm [65,66]. Four exclusive b-tag categories, one single-tag and three double-tag, are formed. In the SM Higgs boson search, boosted decision trees are used as the final discriminating variables; here, they are used to PRL 114, 151802 (2015)",

The jet energies are corrected for E T using a neural network [67]. The CDF analysis uses a multistep discriminant based on neural networks, where two discriminant functions are used to define three separate regions of the final discriminant function. The D0 ZH \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 bb analysis separates events into nonoverlapping samples of events with either a single or double b tag. To increase the signal acceptance, the selection criteria for one of the leptons are loosened to include isolated tracks not reconstructed in the muon detector and electron candidates from the intercryostat region of the D0 detector. Combined with the dielectron and dimuon categories, these provide four independent lepton subchannels. A kinematic fit is used to optimize reconstruction. Random forests (RF) of decision trees [68,69] are used to provide the final variables in the SM Higgs boson search. The first RF is designed to discriminate against tt events and divides events into tt-enriched and tt-depleted single-tag and double-tag regions. Only events in the tt-depleted regions are considered in this study. These regions contain approximately 94% of the SM signal.",

The choice of setting \u03bc exotic \u00bc 1 in the test hypothesis is arbitrary; the sensitivity of the test is reduced if a smaller value is assumed. We use the log-likelihood ratio, LLR, defined to be \u22122 ln\u00bdp\u00f0datajtest\u00de=p\u00f0datajnull\u00de, where the numerator and denominator are maximized over systematic uncertainty variations [18]. The LLR distributions are shown in the Supplemental Material [73]. We define the p values p null \u00bc P\u00f0LLR \u2264 LLR obs jSM\u00de   The similarity of the limits and p values obtained for the J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 and the J P \u00bc 2 \u00fe searches is expected since the exotic models predict excesses in similar portions of kinematic space.",

No evidence is seen for either exotic particle, either in place of the SM Higgs boson or produced in a mixture with a J P \u00bc 0 \u00fe Higgs boson. In both searches, the best-fit cross section times the decay branching ratio into a bottomantibottom quark pair of a J P \u00bc 0 \u00fe signal component is consistent with the prediction of the SM Higgs boson.
