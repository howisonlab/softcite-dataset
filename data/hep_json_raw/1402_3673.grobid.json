High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider [4] at CERN, are ideal machines for producing and eventually detecting DM [5].",

CDM particles, in turn, may be weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a class of DM candidates that arise naturally in models which attempt to explain the 1 origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the typical (weak-scale) cross sections characterising these models are of the same order of magnitude as the WIMP annihilation cross section, thus establishing the so-called WIMP miracle; this is precisely where the connection between Cosmology and Particle Physics lies [7]. WIMP dark matter candidates include the lightest neutralino in models with weak-scale supersymmetry [2], Kaluza-Klein photons arise in scenarios with universal extra dimensions (UED) [3], while lightest T -odd particles are predicted in Little Higgs models [8] with a conserved T -parity. The common denominator in these theories is that they all predict the existence of an electrically neutral, colorless and stable particle, whose decay is prevented by a kind of symmetry: R-parity, connected to baryon and lepton number conservation in SUSY models; KK-parity, the four-dimensional remnant of momentum conservation in extra dimension scenarios; and a Z 2 discrete symmetry called T -parity in Little Higgs models.",

The main advantage of collider searches is that they do not suffer from astrophysical uncertainties and that there is no lower limit to their sensitivity on DM masses. The leading generic diagrams responsible for DM production [18,19] at hadron colliders involve the pair-production of WIMPs plus the initial-or final-state radiation (ISR/FSR) of a gluon, photon or a weak gauge boson Z, W . The ISR/FSR particle is necessary to balance the two WIMPs' momentum, so that they are not produced back-to-back resulting in negligible E miss T .

The analyses outlined here use the full 2011 pp LHC dataset at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV. The primary SM process yielding a true monojet final state is Z-boson production in association with a jet, where the Z decays to two neutrinos. Other known processes acting as background in this search are Z(\u2192 )+jets -with = e, \u00b5-, W +jets, tt as well as single-top events. All electroweak backgrounds and multijet events passing the selections criteria, as well as non-collision backgrounds, are in most cases determined by data-driven methods.

The experimental uncertainties on jet energy scale and resolution and on E miss T range from 1 \u2212 20% of the WIMP event yield, depending on the E miss T and p T thresholds and the considered interaction operator. Other experimental uncertainties include the ones associated with the trigger efficiency and the luminosity measurement. On the other hand, the parton-distribution-function set, the amount of ISR/FSR, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales assumed lead to theoretical uncertainties on the simulated WIMP signal.  From the limit on the visible cross section of new BSM physics processes, lower limits on the suppression scale as a function of the WIMP mass have been derived by the ATLAS Collaboration [20]. The 90% confidence level (CL) lower limits for the D1, D5 and D8 operators are shown in Fig. 1. The observed limit on M * includes experimental uncertainties; the effect of theoretical uncertainties is indicated by dotted \u00b11\u03c3 lines above and below it. Around the expected limit, \u00b11\u03c3 variations due to statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown as a grey band. The lower limits are flat up to m \u03c7 100 GeV and become weaker at higher mass due to the collision energy. In the bottom-right corner of the (m \u03c7 , M * ) plane (light-grey shaded area), the effective field theory approach is no longer valid. The rising lines correspond to couplings consistent with the measured thermal relic density [18], assuming annihilation in the early universe proceeded exclusively via the given operator. Similar exclusion limits for all operators listed in Table 1 are given in Ref. [20]. For the operator D1, the limits are much weaker (\u223c 30 GeV) than for other operators. Nevertheless, if heavy-quark loops are included in the analysis, much stronger bounds on M * can be obtained [22].",

The upper limits on the annihilation rate of WIMPs into light quarks, defined as the product of the annihilation cross section \u03c3 and the relative WIMP velocity v averaged over the WIMP velocity distribution \u03c3v , are shown in Fig. 2. The results are compared to limits on WIMP annihilation to bb, obtained from galactic high-energy gamma-ray observations, measured by the Fermi-LAT telescope [23]. Gamma-ray spectra and yields from WIMPs annihilating to bb, where photons are produced in the hadronisation of the quarks, are expected to be very similar to those from WIMPs annihilating to light quarks [24]. Under this assumption, the ATLAS and Fermi-LAT limits can be compared, after scaling up the Fermi-LAT values by a factor of two to account for the Majorana-to-Dirac fermion adaptation. Again, the ATLAS bounds are especially important for small WIMP masses: below 10 GeV for vector couplings and below about 100 GeV for axial-vector ones. In this region, the ATLAS limits are below the annihilation cross section needed to be consistent with the thermic relic value, keeping the assumption that WIMPs have annihilated to SM quarks only via the particular operator in question. For masses of m \u03c7 200 GeV the ATLAS sensitivity becomes worse than the Fermi-LAT one. In this region, improvements can be expected when going to larger centre-of-mass energies at the LHC.",

[37], the existing W searches from CMS [38] -which share a similar final state with mono-W searches-are used to place a bound on mono-W production at LHC, which for some choices of couplings are better than monojet bounds. This is illustrated in the left (right) panel of Fig. 5, where the spin-dependent (spin-independent) WIMP-proton cross section limits are drawn. The parameter \u03be parametrises the relative strength of the coupling to down-quarks with respect to up-quarks: \u03be = +1 for equal couplings; \u03be = \u22121 for opposite-sign ones; and \u03be = 0 when there is no coupling to down-quarks. Even in cases where the monoleptons do not provide the most stringent constraints, they provide an interesting mechanism to disentangle WIMP couplings to up-type versus down-type quarks. Such an interpretation has also been performed in Ref. [35] yielding similar limits.   Figure 5. CMS monolepton search with 20 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV.

The analysis searches for the production of W or Z bosons decaying hadronically and reconstructed as a single massive jet in association with large E miss T from the undetected \u03c7\u03c7 particles. For this analysis, the jet candidates are reconstructed using a filtering procedure referred to as large-radius jets [40]. This search, the first of its kind, is sensitive to WIMP pair production, as well as to other DM-related models, such as invisible Higgs boson decays (W H or ZH production with H \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7). Figure 6 shows the 90% CL upper limits on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the mass of DM particle for the spin-independent (left) and spin-dependent (right) models obtained by the ATLAS mono-W/Z analysis [39]. The new limits are also compared to the limits set by ATLAS in the 7 TeV monojet analysis [20]. Limits from XENON100 [41], CoGent [31], CDMS II [32], SIMPLE [33], COUPP [42], Picasso [34], IceCube [43] are superimposed for comparison.

The multijet background is determined from the data by a matrix method. All other (smaller) backgrounds are estimated entirely from the simulation, using the most accurate theoretical cross sections available.

The remaining parameters are set to tan \u03b2 = 30, A 0 = \u22122 m 0 , \u00b5 > 0, so as to acquire parameter-space points where the predicted mass of the lightest Higgs boson, h 0 , is near 125 GeV, i.e. compatible with the recently observed Higgs-like boson [13,14].

For masses in the TeV range, it  typically predicts too much cold dark matter, however these predictions depend of the presence of stringy effects that may dilute [58] or enhance [59] the predicted relic dark matter density.

It is stressed that the conservation of R-parity is an ad-hoc assumption. The only firm restriction comes from the proton lifetime: non-conservation of both B and L leads to rapid proton decay. R-parity conservation has serious consequences in SUSY phenomenology in colliders: the SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest SUSY particle is absolutely stable, thus providing a WIMP candidate. Recent CMS analyses are focused on studying the lepton number violating terms \u03bb ijk L i L j\u0113k and \u03bb ijk L i Q jdk , which result in specific signatures involving leptons in events produced in pp collisions at LHC. A search for resonant production and the following decay of\u03bc which is caused by \u03bb 211 = 0 has been conducted [72]. Multilepton signatures caused by LSP decays due to various \u03bb and \u03bb terms in stop production have been probed [73]. Reference [74] discusses the possibility of the generic model independent search for RPV SUSY in 4-lepton events.

These particles, not present in the Standard Model, would provide striking signatures in the detector and rely heavily on a detailed understanding of its performance. In SUSY, non-prompt particle decay can be caused by (i) very weak RPV [76], (ii) low mass difference between a SUSY particle and the LSP [77], or (iii) very weak coupling to the gravitino in GMSB models [78,79]. A small part of these   As a last remark, we address the issue of (not necessarily cold) dark matter in RPV SUSY models. These seemingly incompatible concepts can be reconciled in models with a gravitino [80,81] or an axino [82,83] LSP with a lifetime exceeding the age of the Universe. In both cases, RPV is induced by bilinear terms in the superpotential that can also explain current data on neutrino masses and mixings without invoking any GUT-scale physics [71]. Decays of the next-to-lightest superparticle occur rapidly via RPV interaction, and thus they do not upset the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis, unlike the R-parity conserving case. Such gravitino DM is proposed in the context of \u00b5\u03bdSSM [84] with profound prospects for detecting \u03b3 rays from their decay [85].",
