We employ a fully-automated reconstruction chain capable of identifying EM showers of O(100) MeV energy, relying on a combination of traditional reconstruction techniques together with novel machine-learning approaches. These studies demonstrate good energy resolution, and good agreement between data and simulation, relying on the reconstructed invariant \u03c0 0 mass and other photon distributions for validation. The reconstruction techniques developed are applied to a selection of \u03bd \u00b5 + Ar \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 + X candidate events to demonstrate the potential for calorimetric separation of photons from electrons and reconstruction of \u03c0 0 kinematics.",

The ICARUS experiment has made measurements of \u03c0 0 s from both cosmic-ray [6] and neutrino [7] interactions, both with samples of order 100 reconstructed \u03c0 0 candidates. The ArgoNeuT collaboration has measured \u03c0 0 decays to perform a measurement of semi-inclusive neutral current (NC) production in the NuMI beamline [8]. ArgoNeut's photon energy reconstruction capability is limited by its small volume and lack of containment of electromagnetic showers. The ArgoNeuT collaboration also released the first study on e/\u03b3 separation using calorimetry [9]. This work expands on previous literature by implementing a fully-automated EM energy reconstruction and presenting detailed studies of energy reconstruction and resolution which describe the various sources of energy smearing and bias. This work uses a sample of 440 \u00b1 21 (of which 88 expected background) candidate \u03c0 0 events, the largest available to date. Accurate and efficient reconstruction of electromagnetic activity in LArTPCs is a key to the success of a broad physics program which aims to perform detailed differential cross section measurments of \u03c0 0 production, precise \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e neutrino oscillation measurements, as well as tests of beyond the Standard Model physics models which manifests themselves through O(100 MeV) EM signatures.",

To illustrate this we describe the case of the collection plane wires, oriented vertically (0, 1, 0) in detail. Particles moving in the beam direction (0, 0, 1) are parallel to the collection plane's wire-pitch (0, 0, 1) and therefore deposit their charge on numerous wires. Particles moving perpendicular to the wire-pitch can either be oriented vertically (0, 1, 0) or in the drift direction (1, 0, 0). The former lead to large, isochronous charge deposits which collect on few wires at the same time, while the latter still deposit their charge on very few wires, but this charge is spread in drift, and thus readout time. The orientation-dependent pattern of charge on a wire-plane can lead to angular-dependent reconstruction performance for the identification and reconstruction of charged particle trajectories and EM showers.",

The SSNet network shows very good performance and data-MC agreement on the collection plane, but less so on induction planes, in which additional noise and signal-processing issues cause noise and track-like pixels to be reconstructed as shower-like. For this reason, collection and induction planes are used in different ways: a high-threshold score of 0.9 is placed on induction-plane hits to reject background hits. Induction-plane hits are used solely to reconstruct the 3D direction and start point of EM showers. Completeness in collecting energy deposition is therefore not a concern on these planes. On the other hand, collection-plane hits are selected as shower-like with a score greater than 0.5. This allows the collection of as much energy as possible deposited by EM showers.

The ability of the SSNet algorithm to identify shower-like pixels with an accuracy of better then 90% [15], including in cases where EM energy deposition is track-like, as in this example, motivates the choice to implement this tool in our reconstruction approach. The SSNet network is trained to discriminate between energy deposited by electrons and photons, and that produced by track-like particles (protons, pions, muons). It therefore associates EM activity correlated with muons, such as \u03b4 rays and bremsstrahlung showers, as shower-like. In addition, SSNet pixel tagging often associates energy deposited by muons in proximity to such correlated EM activity to a shower. These types of interactions are a background to the \u03c0 0 reconstruction. Figure 6 shows an example cosmic-ray muon from data with shower-like hits in proximity to EM activity correlated with the muon. Because of the cosmic-ray background in MicroBooNE data and the similar energy deposited by cosmic rays and \u03b3 showers, we target the removal of these backgrounds with specific selection criteria. The PANDORA pattern-recognition cosmic-ray muon reconstruction (section 4.1 of reference [21]) is used to identify cosmic muon tracks in 3D. Those longer than 50 cm are selected. If such tracks have an Impact Parameter (I P) with respect to the neutrino vertex greater than 10 cm, all shower-like hits associated either to the track itself or to any correlated \u03b4 rays are removed. Remaining shower-like hits from the cosmic muon of figure 6 after these cuts are applied are shown in the image on the right. ",

We examine the inefficiencies here, studying in the simulation the deficit between the energy recovered at each step in the reconstruction versus the true photon energy. The metric we utilize is the fractional energy difference [E reco \u2212 E deposited ]/E deposited with E deposited the photon energy deposited in the TPC active volume from simulation, and E reco the energy associated with surviving hits on the collection plane. Figure 8 reports this study for the four stages in our reconstruction, evaluated on a sample of photons from simulated BNB \u03bd \u00b5 CC \u03c0 0 neutrino interactions with overlayed simulated CORSIKA [22] cosmic-ray particles. Hit finding, in black in the figure, encapsulates the effect of identifying signals produced by energy deposits on the wires and reconstructing hits associated with them. The distribution at this stage is largely symmetric around zero with entries above zero caused by energy response smearing in the reconstruction. Nonetheless, a negative offset of 10% in the peak of the distribution is present, associated with thresholding effects which impact EM showers due to the significant number of energy depositions of less than a few hundred keV. In simulation, we find that the hit reconstruction threshold on the collection plane is approximately 300 keV. Pixel-labeling, in red in the figure, begins to significantly skew the distribution, adding to the bias and to the low-end tail in the distribution. The bias intensifies further after the cosmic-removal stage, in blue in the figure, particularly with a significant broadening of the low-end tail due to events for which many of the photon hits are removed due to their accidental proximity to a cosmic-ray muon. Finally, the clustering stage, in cyan in the figure, exhibits an additional residual inefficiency. In moving from hit finding to clustering, the purity of the collected photon showers is increasing. The skewed and biased nature of the distribution of figure 8 will impact energy reconstruction for EM showers, as will be discussed in detail in Section 5. The purity of clustered charge is also evaluated and found to be on average 82%.",

We further demand that one of the two clusters must be associated to the collection plane, as this will provide us with the best information with which to perform calorimetry and measure the energy of the \u03b3. Finally, only clusters which have at least 10 reconstructed hits will be considered. The matching algorithm applied calculates the overlap in time of pairs of clusters from different wire-planes and assigns a score based on this overlap. Cluster-pairs with the highest score are then merged. The figure of merit devised as the overlap score is denoted IoU, for Intersection over Union, and is defined as the time-interval common to the two clusters over the union of the two clusters' time-spans. A minimum IoU of 0.25 is required to match two clusters, and clusters are matched in order of their score: if a cluster has a match with two or more other clusters, the pair with the largest score is associated as belonging to the same \u03b3.",

This charge may have been missed at an earlier reconstruction stage due to a conservative clustering approach which purposely attempts to avoid including accidental charge in the shower.

The shower reconstruction efficiency as a function of true \u03b3 deposited energy in the TPC is shown in figure 9 (b). We note that we achieve a shower reconstruction efficiency of at least 60% for showers with more than 100 MeV of deposited energy and that reconstruct to within 10 degrees of the true shower direction. The efficiency drops for energies below 100 MeV, mostly due to the challenge of identifying low-energy EM showers due to their topological features. The efficiency is found to depend on shower direction as well, with a decrease in efficiency for showers propagating in the drift and vertical directions, perpendicular and parallel to the collection-plane wire directions respectively. This is because the shower projection on the collection plane is particularly challenging to reconstruct if the charge is collected on only a few wires.

Backgrounds are dominated by categories in which EM activity in the event originates either from charge-exchange interactions induced by a final-state charged pion which exits the target nucleus (\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 + p) or events where cosmic-ray EM activity near the neutrino vertex is mis-associated.

In terms of magnitude, recombination is the largest physics effect that impacts energy collection, suppressing almost half of the energy deposited in the detector. When correcting for ion recombination, the observables to take into account are the local electric field and the local energy deposition density, which can be related to the observable dE/dx. For particles which deposit energy at different rates along their path, such as stopping muons or protons, accounting for the significantly varying recombination factor at different steps in a particle's path is essential to recover the correct calorimetric energy measurement. In the case of EM activity, which has a much flatter energy loss rate over a wide energy range, this correction is much more uniform. In addition, calculating an accurate path length dx necessary to recover the correct recombination factor stepby-step is made difficult by the fact that reconstructing the 3D direction of EM energy deposition hit-by-hit is very challenging for the bulk of the shower. We therefore decide to implement an effective recombination correction applied to the total measured shower charge. The effective recombination factor, R effective , accounts for the global impact of charge quenching on a given EM shower, and is defined in equation 5.1 as the fraction of charge surviving after recombination, where Q visible is the total number of drifting electrons released after quenching, E deposited the total energy deposited by the EM shower, and W ion the work function of argon. and is meant to account for the global impact of charge quenching on a given EM shower.",

We next evaluate the performance of this energy reconstruction procedure on EM showers in simulation. Figure 13 compares the reconstructed to true \u03b3 energy for \u03b3 showerss from simulated \u03bd \u00b5 CC \u03c0 0 interactions. Unlike for muons, a significant bias is observed. This bias is introduced by two main effects: charge falling below the threshold necessary to identify and reconstruct a hit (thresholding) and inefficiencies due to hits not correctly labeled as shower-like, or not accounted for in the 2D reconstruction of shower clusters (under-clustering). The intrinsically lossy nature of these processes leads to an under-estimation of the total shower energy. These biases must be accounted for in order to recover the correct energy scale and reconstruct the kinematics of the photons and hence of the \u03c0 0 s which produced them. In order to quantify the bias observed, and be able to correct for it, we extract, in bins of true energy, the fractional energy resolution defined as (E reco \u2212 E true )/E true , and fit each distribution to a Gaussian plus a low-tail exponential. This choice is motivated by the interest in modeling the lossy impact of clustering and thresholding on energy reconstruction. Examples of such distributions and the resulting fits are shown in figure 14 for three energy ranges. The mean of the fitted Gaussian is taken as an estimate of the most-probable energy bias for each true energy bin. The bias is found to range between 10% and 20%, depending on the energy bin.",

While different approaches, which included allowing the fit intercept to float, led to bias corrections which were statistically significant, they ultimately caused an O(1%) difference in the reconstructed di-photon invariant mass (M \u03b3\u03b3 ) distribution. While in this work an energy-independent correction is applied, in the future, and depending on the details of the implemented reconstruction, adopting an energy-dependent correction may be beneficial. We note that the bias correction obtained for this reconstruction is smaller than the value of 1/0.70 obtained from MicroBooNE's previous study of EM activity at lower energy based on Michel electrons [10]. This is a consequence of an improved energy reconstruction and refined charge collection capabilities. ",

The energy resolution is quantified in two ways: the Gaussian \u03c3 of the fit function is taken to represent the resolution for the bulk of the distribution, while the reported 68% interval accounts for the low-end tail by integrating 68% of entries asymmetrically around the peak in proportion to the ratio of areas below and above the peak. Measurements of the energy resolution as a function of true photon energy from simulation are reported, using these two definitions, in figure 15. The fitted Gaussian gives a resolution of 8-12%, while the 68% interval method results in a width of 15-20%. The flat nature of the energy resolution as a function of energy indicates that rather than being limited by the 1/ \u221a E dependence typical of a total absorption calorimeter, we are in a regime where other effects, including clustering inefficiencies, dominate the energy smearing. This resolution meets, in the 50-300 MeV energy range studied, the requirements for electron energy measurements of DUNE (2% \u2295 15% / E [GeV]) [4] which corresponds to a resolution of 47% and 27% at 100 and 300 MeV, respectively.

The fact that the calibration relying on the invariant mass itself is consistent with the calibration procedure performed relying on stopping muons (found to be accurate at the 3% level, with possible additional angular dependences which can impact showers more significantly) is an indication of a sound calibration procedure and well modeled detector response for EM showers. In figure 17, and subsequently in comparisons of dE/dx distributions, for simulation distributions the 1.055 scaling described in appendix A is applied.

We measure shower dE/dx using hits deposited in the first 4 cm from the photon showering point (in a similar way as presented by the ArgoNeuT collaboration [9]) and measuring their median dE/dx value. This work shows a measurement of shower dE/dx performed in a fully automated way for the first time.

We have shown that we are able to obtain energy resolutions in the range 10-20%, meeting the requirements for electron energy reconstruction in DUNE's long-baseline neutrino oscillation program [4].

This section aims to quantify the level of data-simulation agreement, and utilize the reconstructed M \u03b3\u03b3 from \u03c0 0 candidates as an additional, orthogonal, calibration tool. To quantify the level of agreement in the reconstructed M \u03b3\u03b3 variable, we measure the \u03c7 2 between the area normalized data and simulation distributions, accounting for statistical uncertainties only, as a function of a relative energy scaling applied. Furthermore, the \u03c7 2 is computed only for bins below 250 MeV/c 2 to focus on signal events. The result of this measurement is shown in figure 20 and indicates a 5.5% discrepancy in energy scale. Specifically, the simulation distribution underestimates by 5.5% what is reconstructed in data. The \u2206 \u03c7 2 = 1 scaling factor correction covers the range [0.98, 1.13]. This factor is compatible with the calibration outlined in section 5 when accounting for the 3% expected level of uncertainty.

For this distribution we also see an improved level of data-simulation agreement after the scaling obtained from the \u03c0 0 mass is applied. It is important to note that unlike for shower energy reconstruction, calorimetric dE/dx is not impacted by the effect of hit-thresholding and charge-clustering, suggesting that the uncertainty in energy scale for \u03b3 reconstruction is primarily contributed by the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale calibration.
