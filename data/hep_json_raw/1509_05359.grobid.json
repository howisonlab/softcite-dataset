Recent STAR results show that in \u221a s NN = 200 GeV central Au+Au collisions the \u03a5(1S) state is suppressed more than the case that if only cold nuclear matter effects were present, and the excited state yields are consistent with a complete suppression. In 2012, STAR also collected 263.4 \u00b5b \u22121 high-energy-electron triggered data in U+U collisions at \u221a s NN = 193 GeV. Central U+U collisions, with an estimated 20% higher energy density than that in central Au+Au data, extend the \u03a5(1S+2S+3S) and \u03a5(1S) nuclear modification trends observed in Au+Au towards higher number of participant nucleons, and confirm the suppression of the \u03a5(1S) state. We see a hint with 1.8 \u03c3 significance that the \u03a5(2S+3S) excited states are not completely suppressed in U+U collisions. These data support the sequential in-medium quarkonium dissociation picture and favor models with a strong qq binding.",

            "text": "It has long been suggested that, due to the screening of the heavy quark potential, the yield of heavy quarkonia is suppressed in heavy-ion collisions compared to expectations from p+p collisions. Charmonium suppression was, in fact, anticipated as a key signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation [1]. Moreover, it is expected that quarkonium states follow a sequential suppression pattern, where states with lower binding energies dissociate (\"melt\") at lower temperatures than states with higher binding energies, thus quarkonium measurements may serve as a thermometer of the medium [2]. Despite early expectations, it has been found that the energy dependence of J/\u03c8 suppression is rather weak from SPS to top RHIC energies [3,4]. 1 e-mail: vertesi.robert@wigner.mta.hu An explanation to this is that later recombination (coalescence) of cc pairs gives a sizeable contribution to the J/\u03c8 yield which compensates for melting. Moreover, d+Au measurements proved that the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects also play an important role [5]. Feed-down from heavier states such as \u03c7 c , \u03c8 and B mesons to J/\u03c8 also contribute to the measured yields. Bottomonia are expected to be less affected by many of these effects than charmonia, as co-mover absorbtion and recombination are predicted to be negligible at RHIC energies [6]. Therefore it provides a cleaner probe for QGP effects. Nevertheless, feed-down such as \u03c7 b , \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) decaying to \u03a5(1S) is still present in the case of bottomonia.",

A similarly defined R dAu is used for describing nuclear modification in d+Au collisions. Measurements in p+p collisions are essential not only as a baseline for nuclear modification, but also as a benchmark for theoretical calculations. NLO pQCD calculations with the color evaporation model [8] describe the \u03a5 measurements at RHIC within their uncertainties [9]. Fig. 1 shows the R dAu versus rapidity measured by STAR and PHENIX [11]. The models shown in the figure consider different CNM effects, and they predict a rather small nuclear modification in mid-rapidity d+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [8,10]. Interestingly, STAR measurements show a strongly suppressed \u03a5 production at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5), although the uncertainties are relatively high [9]. This is a warning that CNM effects may also play an important role in nucleusnucleus collisions, or that hot nuclear matter effects may also be present in ",

Momentum measurement and electron identification based on the specific energy loss dE/dx were done in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). Further electron identification was applied using the BEMC. The position of the reconstructed tracks were extrapolated towards the BEMC surface and matched to hits in BEMC towers. Three adjacent towers around a BEMC hit that contained the highest energy deposits were combined into clusters in order to get a better estimate of the total energy deposit. Electron candidates were then required to have a cluster energy close to its momentum. Since electromagnetic showers are generally compact, most of the cluster energy was required to be in a single tower.

While the \u03a5(1S) is similarly suppressed in \u221a s NN =200 GeV Au+Au collisions to the high-p T J/\u03c8 mesons, there is a stronger suppression in the case of the excited states \u03a5(2S+3S). This attests to the sequential melting picture in the presence of a deconfined medium. The suppression pattern seen in the case of the U+U collisions is consistent with the trend marked in Au+Au collisons and extends it towards higher N part values. The indication of \u03a5(1S) suppression in central Au+Au collisions is confirmed by the new measurements in U+U. There is a hint with an 1.8 \u03c3 significance that \u03a5(2S+3S) is not completely suppressed in 0-60% U+U collisions at \u221a s NN =193 GeV.",

Ongoing analysis of the high-statistics \u221a s NN =200 GeV Au+Au dataset, taken in 2014 with the recently inaugurated MTD detector, will strongly reduce both the statistical and systematic uncertainties. We expect separate R AA measurements of all three \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) states with strongly reduced uncertainties [19]. High statistics p+Au collisions taken in 2015 will help us gain a deeper insight to the CNM effects.",
