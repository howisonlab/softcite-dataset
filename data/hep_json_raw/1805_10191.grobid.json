Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 60 GeV are probed, and no excess of events above the SM expectation is observed. Upper limits between 3 and 12% are set on the branching fraction B(h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u03c4 2b) assuming the SM production of the Higgs boson. Upper limits are also set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different 2HDM + S scenarios.",

The CMS Collaboration also studied the 2\u03bc2\u03c4 final state for 15.0 < m a < 62.5 GeV at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV [23]. The ATLAS Collaboration reported results for the following final states at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV: 4\u03bc, 4e, and 2e2\u03bc for 15 < m a < 60 GeV [24]; 4\u03b3 for 10 < m a < 62 GeV [25]; and 2\u03bc2\u03c4 for 3.7 < m a < 50.0 GeV [26]. At a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the ATLAS Collaboration published results for the 4b decay channel for 20 < m a < 60 GeV [27], and 4\u03bc, 4e, and 2e2\u03bc for 1 < m a < 60 GeV [28]. The 2b2\u03c4 final state has never been probed so far. This final state benefits from large branching fractions in most models because of the large masses of \u03c4 leptons and b quarks with respect to other leptons and quarks. The presence of light leptons originating from the \u03c4 decays allows events to be triggered in the dominant gluon fusion production mode.",

Throughout this Letter, the term \u03c4 h denotes \u03c4 leptons decaying hadronically. The \u03c4 \u03c4 final states studied in this search are e\u03bc, e\u03c4 h , and \u03bc\u03c4 h . Despite its large branching fraction, the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state is not considered because the signal acceptance is negligible with the transverse momentum (p T ) thresholds available for the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h triggers. The ee and \u03bc\u03bc final states for the \u03c4 \u03c4 pair are not considered either, because they have a low branching fraction and suffer from a large contribution of Drell-Yan background events.",

Within the solenoid volume, there are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [29]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [30].",

These samples are simulated at leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with the MLM jet matching and merging [32]. The Z + jets and W + jets processes are also generated with the MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator at LO with the MLM jet matching and merging. The Z + jets simulation contains non-resonant Drell-Yan production, with a minimum dilepton mass threshold of 10 GeV. The FxFx merging scheme [33] is used to generate diboson background with the MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator at next-to-LO (NLO). The tt and single top quark processes are generated at NLO with the powheg 2.0 and 1.0 generator [34][35][36][37][38][39]. Backgrounds from SM Higgs boson production are generated at NLO with the powheg 2.0 generator [40], and the minlo hvj [41] extension of powheg 2.0 is used for the Wh and Zh simulated samples. The generators are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [42] to model the parton showering and fragmentation, as well as the decay of the \u03c4 leptons. The CUETP8M1 tune [43] is chosen for the pythia parameters that affect the description of the underlying event. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) is NLO NNPDF3.0 for NLO samples, and LO NNPDF3.0 for LO samples [44]. The full next-to-NLO (NNLO) plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) order calculation [45][46][47][48][49][50], performed with the Top++ 2.0 program [51], is used to compute a tt production cross section equal to 832 +20 \u221229 (scale) \u00b1 35 (PDF + \u03b1 S ) pb setting the top quark mass to 172.5 GeV. This cross section is used to normalize the tt background simulated with powheg.",

The sum neutral p T represents a similar quantity for neutral particles. The last term corresponds to the p T of neutral particles from pileup vertices, which, as estimated from simulation, is equal to approximately half of that of charged hadrons associated with pileup vertices, denoted by charged,PU p T . The p T of the lepton is denoted p T . The azimuthal angle, \u03c6, is measured in radians. Jets are reconstructed from PF objects with the anti-k T clustering algorithm implemented in the FastJet library [56,57], using a distance parameter of 0.4. Corrections to the jet energy are applied as a function of the p T and \u03b7 of the jet [58].

The categories are defined on the basis of the invariant mass of the visible decay products of the \u03c4 leptons and the b-tagged jet with the highest p T , denoted by m vis b\u03c4 \u03c4 . This variable is typically low for signal events because the three objects originate from a 125 GeV Higgs boson, but it is on average much larger for background events, where the three objects do not originate from a decay of a resonance, as shown in Fig. 2 for the \u03bc\u03c4 h final state. The thresholds that define the categories depend on the \u03c4 \u03c4 final state: they are lower in the e\u03bc final state because there are more neutrinos not included in the mass calculation, and they are higher in the e\u03c4 h final state to keep enough events despite the lower signal acceptance related to the electron p T thresholds. Signal events with m a 25 GeV contribute mostly to the first two categories, whereas those with m a 25 GeV are concentrated in the second and third categories. This can be explained by the fact that the missing b jet in the mass calculation would be closer to the reconstructed b jet for a signal with lower m a because of the boost of the pseudoscalar bosons, leading to a larger reconstructed mass. The last category has large background yields; it is useful to constrain the various backgrounds and provides some additional sensitivity for low-m a signal samples. The results of the search are extracted from a fit of the visible \u03c4 \u03c4 mass (m vis \u03c4 \u03c4 ) distributions in each of the categories, because this is a resonant distribution for signal events.",

Upper limits at 95% CL are set on (\u03c3 (h)/\u03c3 SM )B(h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u03c4 2b) using the modified frequentist construction CL s in the asymptotic approximation [73][74][75][76][77], for pseudoscalar masses between 15 and 60 GeV. In this expression, \u03c3 SM denotes the SM production cross section of the Higgs boson, whereas \u03c3 (h) is the h production cross section. The limits per channel and for the combination of the three channels are shown in Fig. 7. The most sensitive final state is \u03bc\u03c4 h . The sensitivity of the e\u03c4 h and e\u03bc channels is approximately equivalent; the first channel suffers from higher trigger thresholds and lower object identification efficiency than \u03bc\u03c4 h , and the second one suffers from a lower branching fraction than \u03bc\u03c4 h . At low m a , the e\u03bc final state has a higher signal ac-  This improves by more than one order of magnitude previous limits on B(h \u2192 aa) obtained in the 2\u03bc2\u03c4 final state by CMS for 15 < m a < 25 GeV [20,23], and by up to a factor five those obtained in the 2\u03bc2b final state by CMS for 25 < m a < 60 GeV [20]. In the scenario with the highest branching fraction, 2HDM + S type III with tan \u03b2 = 2, the expected limit is as low as 6% at intermediate m a . Fig. 8 shows the observed limits at 95% CL on (\u03c3 (h)/\u03c3 SM )B(h \u2192 aa) as a function of m a and tan \u03b2 for type III and type IV 2HDM + S, for which there is a strong dependence with tan \u03b2. Fig. 9 shows the observed limits at 95% CL on (\u03c3 (h)/\u03c3 SM )B(h \u2192 aa) for a few scenarios of 2HDM + S, assuming the branching fractions of the light pseudoscalar to SM particles computed using Refs. [15,78]. The limit shown for type II 2HDM + S is approximately valid for any value of tan \u03b2 > 1, and that for type I 2HDM + S does not depend on tan \u03b2. In the m a range considered in the analysis, the branching fraction B(aa \u2192 bb\u03c4 \u03c4 ) ranges between 0.10 and 0.11 in type I 2HDM + S, between 0.11 and 0.13 for tan \u03b2 = 2 in type II 2HDM + S, between 0.44 and 0.46 for tan \u03b2 = 2 in type III 2HDM + S, and between 0.16 and 0.21 for tan \u03b2 = 0.5 in type IV 2HDM + S.",
