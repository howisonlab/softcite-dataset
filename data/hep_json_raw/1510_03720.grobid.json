However, the resulting experimental data suffers from low statistics, incomplete beam momentum coverage, and large differences between the measurements reported by different experiments. Also popular models of proton-proton interactions mostly fail to reproduce the measurements. The data on production and the model predictions are reviewed at the end of this paper.",

            "text": "At the same time rather impressive progress was made in measurements of hyperon production in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions [1]. This has two reasons. Firstly, mean multiplicities of all hadrons in central heavy ion collisions are typically two to three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding multiplicities in inelastic p+p interactions. Secondly, the hyperon yields per nucleon are enhanced by substantial factors in A+A collisions with respect to p+p interactions. This enhancement, which increases with the strangeness content of the hyperon in question, has raised considerable interest over the past decades. It has in particular been brought into connection with production of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, a 'deconfined' state of matter at that time hypothetical [2,3]. Nowadays, for the energies well below the LHC energy range, nucleus-nucleus collisions are investigated mainly to find the critical point of strongly interacting matter as well as to study the properties of the onset of deconfinement [4,5]. In particular, precise measurements of inclusive hadron production properties as a function of beam momentum (13A-158A GeV/c) and size of colliding nuclei (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La) are performed by NA61/SHINE [6]. Results on inelastic p+p interactions are an important part of this scan.",

The main detector system is a set of large volume time projection chambers (TPCs). Two of them (VTPC-1 and VTPC-2) are placed inside super-conducting magnets (VTX-1 and VTX-2) with a combined bending power of 9 Tm.

V 0 candidates were required to have a distance of closest approach (dca, Fig. 2) between the two trajectories of less than 1 cm anywhere between the position of the first measured points on the tracks and the primary vertex. In the second step, the position of the secondary vertex and the momenta of the decay tracks were fitted by performing a 9-parameter \u03c7 2 fit employing the Levenberg-Marquardt fitting procedure [15,16]. In the fit the fitted secondary vertex was added as the first point to the tracks at which the momenta were recalculated. Finally, for each candidate the invariant mass was calculated assuming proton (pion) mass for positively (negatively) charged particles. To ensure a good momentum determination and reduce the com- binatorial background from random pairs, a set of quality cuts was imposed:",

(ii) Proton and pion candidates were selected by requiring their specific energy loss measured by the TPCs to be within 3 \u03c3 around the nominal Bethe-Bloch value. This cut was applied only to experimental data. (iii) For the simulated data (see below) the background was totally discarded by matching, i.e. by using only those reconstructed tracks which were identified as originating from the corresponding decay. The identification was performed by matching the clusters found in the TPCs with the clusters generated in the simulation. In case more than one reconstructed track was matched to a decay daughter the one with the largest number of matched clusters was selected. (iv) The combinatorial background concentrated in the vicinity of the primary vertex is reduced by imposing a distance cut on the difference between the z coordinate of the primary and vertex ( z = z \u2212 z primar y , see Fig. 3). To maximise the fraction of rejected background while minimising the number of lost candidates, a rapidity dependent cut was applied: z > 10 cm for y < 0.25, z > 15 cm for y \u2208 [0.25, 0.75], z > 40 cm for y \u2208 [0.75, 1.25], and z > 60 cm for higher rapidities. (v) A further significant part of the background (e.g. pairs from photon conversions) was rejected by imposing a cut on cos \u03c6, where \u03c6 is defined as the angle between the vectors y , and n, where y is the vector perpendicular to the momentum of the V 0 -particle which lies in the plane spanned by the y-axis and the V 0 -momentum vector, and n is a vector normal to the decay plane (see Fig.  4). A rapidity dependent cut was used: | cos \u03c6| < 0.95 for y < \u22120.25, | cos \u03c6| < 0.9 for y \u2208 [\u22120.25, 0.75], | cos \u03c6| < 0.8 for higher rapidities. (vi) The trajectories of the candidates were calculated using the decay vertex and the momentum vectors of the decay particles. Extrapolation back to the primary vertex plane resulted in impact parameters b x (in the magnetic bending plane) and b y (see Fig. 2). As the resolution of impact parameters is approximately twice better in y than in x direction, an elliptic cut (b x /2) 2 + b 2 y < 1 cm was imposed in order to reduce the background from candidates which do not originate from the primary vertex.",

In order to ensure the stability of the fit results, even in the case of low statistics, a three step procedure was developed. In the first step, a pre-fit was performed in order to estimate the initial parameters of the background function. For that purpose, the invariant mass region containing the peak (1.100-1.135 GeV/c 2 ) was excluded from the fit. In the second step, the invariant mass spectrum was fitted to the sum of the signal and the background. The initial values for the parameters of the background function were taken from the first step, while the mass parameter m 0 was fixed to the PDG value m = 1.115683 GeV/c 2 [18] and the width was set to 3 MeV. The obtained values were used as the initial parameters for the third step, where no parameter was fixed.

The raw number of -hyperons (n I (k, l)) was then obtained by subtracting the fitted background and integrating the remaining signal distributions in the mass window m 0 \u00b1 3 (see Fig. 7), where m 0 is the fitted mass. The low statistics of the LH removed data set, forced to restrict the fits to y (x F ) bins summed over the transverse variable, resulting in n R (k). In order to obtain the raw number of -hyperons in (k, l) bins, it was assumed that the shape of the p T distributions and the efficiencies for a given y (x F ) bin were the same for the two data sets, and n R (k, l) was calculated as",

The simulated events were reconstructed with the same software as used for real events and the same selection cuts were applied (except the identification cut).

The data for the lifetime analysis were binned in rapidity k = y (from \u22121.5 to +1.0, in steps of 0.5) and life-time normalised to the mean lifetime t/\u03c4 P DG [18] (from 0.00 to 4.75, in steps of 0.25) with c\u03c4 P DG = 7.89 cm. The life-time was calculated using the distance r between the V 0 -decay vertex and the interaction vertex of the V 0candidates (t = r/(\u03b3\u03b2), where \u03b3 , \u03b2 are the Lorentz variables). Then d 2 n/(dydt) was calculated and an exponential function was fitted to the life-time distribution for each rapidity bin separately (see the example in Fig. 10a for y = \u22121.0). The ratio of the fitted mean life-time \u03c4 to the corresponding PDG value \u03c4 P DF is shown in Fig. 10b as a function of rapidity. The fitted mean life-times are seen to agree with the PDG The expected forward-backward symmetry of the data was also checked. The final double-and single-differential distributions used for this test were found to agree for the corresponding backward and forward rapidities within the statistical errors.",

An additional source of systematic uncertainty arises from the extrapolation of the multiplicity to full phase-space. This was estimated by an alternative procedure based on a parametrisation of published rapidity distributions. In an iterative procedure a symmetric polynomial of 4 th order [22] was fitted to the (1/ n )(dn/dz) distributions obtained by five bubble-chamber experiments [23][24][25][26][27] and the NA61/SHINE data, where z stands for y/y beam . First, the fit included only the five bubble-chamber datasets. Next, the NA61/SHINE spectrum was normalised to the fit result obtained in the first step and added as the 6 th set for the fit. Finally, the procedure was iterated using those six datasets until the normalisation factor converged. The ratio of the integral of the fitted function 1 dn dz (z) = 0.394 + 1.99z 2 \u2212 2.66z 4 (see Fig. 15) for the full range of rapidity to the integral in the range outside of the NA61/SHINE acceptance was used as the extrapolation factor for the NA61/SHINE results. This ratio amounted to 1.92 \u00b1 0.12, i.e. 48 % of the total production is outside of the acceptance for this procedure resulting in a mean multiplicity of = 0.129 \u00b1 0.008. The difference between this result and the linear extrapolation of the x F distribution is added in quadrature to the (positive) systematic error. The final result for the multiplicity in inelastic p+p interactions at 158 GeV/c then reads as follows: = 0.120 \u00b1 0.006 (stat.) \u00b1 0.010 (sys.)",

The experiments published data for the backward hemisphere, however, with rather small statistics [23][24][25][26][27] and correspondingly large uncertainties. In order to account for the difference in beam momentum the spectra are shown in terms of the scaled rapidity z = y/y beam and were normalised to unity in order to compare the shapes. Note, that the same data sets were also used to compute the alternative correction factor used to estimate   Though the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty of the NA61/SHINE measurement is much smaller than for the other experiments, and the results are consistent with all the datasets used for the comparison, the general tendency obtained by fitting a symmetric polynomial of 4 th order does not describe well the NA61/SHINE data. On the other hand, the result of Brick et al. for which the beam momentum (147 GeV/c) differs the least from the NA61/SHINE momentum, shows the best agreement.",

The lines are fitted using Eq. (12) experiments [23,25,26,[29][30][31] at nearby beam momenta is shown in Fig. 17. The NA61/SHINE results are consistent with the experiments performed at proton beams of lower energy, although the dip-like structure visible at central x F in the data from the experiments operating at higher energies is not observed. Figure 18 shows a comparison of rapidity spectra divided by the mean number of wounded nucleons 1/ N W in inelastic p+p interactions (this paper) and central C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb collisions (NA49 [32,33]) at 158 A GeV/c. The yield of hyperons per wounded nucleon increases with increasing N W as a consequence of strangeness enhancement in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Figure 19 displays m T spectra at mid-rapidity for inelastic p+p interactions (this paper) and central nucleus-nucleus  19], Urqmd [34,35] and Fritiof [36] models. The chain line was used to extrapolate the NA61/SHINE measurements to full phase space. For details see text collisions (NA49 [32,33]) at 158 A GeV/c. The inverse slope parameter of the spectrum increases with increasing nuclear size due to increasing transverse flow. A comparison with calculations from the models Epos1.99 [19], Urqmd3.4 [34,35], and Fritiof7.02 [36] embedded in Hsd2.0 [37] is presented in Fig. 20.",
