The results for the inclusive differential production cross section are presented as a function of energy in three different pseudorapidity regions: \u03b7 > 10.76, 8.99 < \u03b7 < 9.22 and 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99. The analysis was performed using a data set acquired in June 2015 that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.194 nb \u22121 . The measurements were compared with the predictions of several hadronic interaction models used to simulate air showers generated by Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. None of these generators showed good agreement with the data for all pseudorapidity intervals. For \u03b7 > 10.76, no model is able to reproduce the observed peak structure at around 5 TeV and all models underestimate the total production cross section: among them, QGSJET II-04 shows the smallest deficit with respect to data for the whole energy range. For 8.99 < \u03b7 < 9.22 and 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99, the models having the best overall agreement with data are SIBYLL 2.3 and EPOS-LHC, respectively: in particular, in both regions SIBYLL 2.3 is able to reproduce the observed peak structure at around 1.5-2.5 TeV.",

            "text": "In recent years, several ground-based experiments, like the Pierre Auger Observatory [1] and Telescope Array [2], have measured the flux and composition [3,4] of cosmic rays at energies above 10 18 eV, the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). In all cases, the results are affected by large systematic uncertainties because of the reliance on hadronic interaction models necessary for the data analysis. These generators are in fact extensively used in the reconstruction of incident cosmic rays starting from the Extensive Air Shower (EAS) they form when interacting in the atmosphere. Because of the lack of calibration data, relative to forward secondary particle production in high energy collisions, these models show a very different behavior, especially in the phase space regions that are relevant to the EAS physics [5]. Some of these generators, namely QGSJET II-04 [6], EPOS-LHC [7] and SIBYLL 2.3 [8], were tuned using the measurements made in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV, during the Run I operations at CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [9], the highest energy accelerator currently available. Even considering these post-LHC models, the level of agreement between them is far from satisfactory [10] and higher energy data is needed to reduce the observed discrepancies.

Of particular interest are the forward neutral hadrons detectable by the experiment, mainly neutrons, because of the key role that forward baryons have in the development of the atmospheric showers and in the abundance of the muonic component [12]. The measurements relative to the inclusive differential cross section of forward neutrons produced in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV have already been published by our collaboration [13]. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the data obtained in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, making use of the same pseudorapidity regions defined in the previous work. Compared to the 7 TeV run, this corresponds to an effective increase of the energy in the laboratory frame by a factor of four and an increase in the p T coverage by a factor of two. The results presented here were obtained using data from only one of the two LHCf detectors (Arm2), but in the future we will extend this analysis to the other one (Arm1) in order to enlarge the pseudorapidity coverage, exploiting the slightly different geometrical acceptance of the two detectors.",

All simulations steps (collision, transport and interaction with the detector) used Cosmos 7.633 [17] and EPICS 9.15 [18] libraries, except where otherwise specified. In the following, MC are separated in three different categories, summarized in table 1: a) MC that require a full detector simulation, i.e. generating collisions, transporting secondary products from IP1 to the TAN region (taking into account the effect of the magnetic field, particle decays and particle interactions with the beam pipe) and finally simulating the interaction with the detector. Three different models were used to generate collisions: QGSJET II-04, EPOS-LHC and DPMJET 3.04 [19], with a corresponding statistics of 10 8 , 5\u00d710 7 and 2\u00d710 7 inelastic collisions, respectively. In all cases, the transport along the beam pipe and the interaction with the detector were simulated using the DPMJET 3.04 model. In addition, we generated another special set of 4\u00d710 7 inelastic collisions dedicated to multihit events (events in which more than one particle enters a given calorimetric tower) both for QGSJET II-04 and EPOS-LHC. These special events were generated in two steps. First, starting from the full sample described above, we separated each multihit event, where n particles simultaneously hit the detector, into n independent singlehit events (events in which only one particle enters a given calorimetric tower). Then, we simulated again the interaction with the detector, this time one particle at a time. All the full detector simulations were used for the validation of the whole analysis procedure and for a preliminary comparison with experimental data at the folded spectra level, as well as for the estimation of a part of the correction factors (beam-pipe background, Particle IDentification (PID), multihit, fake, missed, see section 5.2) and of the systematic uncertainties (position resolution, unfolding method, see section 5.4). Note that for this last purpose (evaluation of corrections and uncertainties), only QGSJET II-04 and EPOS-LHC were used as collision generators, whereas DPMJET 3.04 was  Table 1. Summary of the three MC sets described in the text. The simulation is divided in three main steps: generation of particles produced in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, transport of secondary products from IP1 to the TAN region (taking into account the effect of the magnetic field, particle decays and particle interactions with the beam pipe), interaction of particles with the Arm2 detector. For each MC set we specified which software interfaces and which interaction models were used to simulate each step. The symbol \"-\" indicates that it was not necessary to simulate the given step for that MC set. excluded because of its very limited agreement with data already at the folded spectra level (as discussed in section 6). b) MC that require only the generation of collisions and the transport of secondary products from IP1 to the TAN region, without taking into account the interaction with the detector. We simulated 10 8 collisions for each of the following models: QGSJET II-04, EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL 2.3, DPMJET 3.06 and PYTHIA 8.212 [20]. The PYTHIA 8.212 simulation data set was generated using its own dedicated generator, whereas CRMC [21], an interface tool for event generators, was employed for the remaining models (version 1.5.6 for DPMJET 3.06, version 1.6.0 for the others). In both cases, all particles having c\u03c4 < 1 cm were considered unstable and their decay was treated by the interface. After generation, the secondary products were transported along the beam pipe making use of the DPMJET 3.04 model. All these simulations were used in the estimation of the hadron contamination correction factors and for the comparison with the measured distributions after unfolding. c) MC that require only the interaction with the detector to construct the response matrix used for unfolding. In order to be independent of the particular shape of the injected distribution, we considered a single neutron flat energy spectrum from 0 to 6.5 TeV, uniformly distributed on the whole area of the detector. The interaction with the detector was simulated using DPMJET 3.04 and QGSJET II-04, so that we could estimate the dependence of the results on the model adopted in the unfolding procedure. 1 This sample consists of about 10 7 neutrons per tower for each model.",

In particular, because of the inherent difficulty found in correctly identifying a multihit hadronic event, we decided to reconstruct all events as singlehit and to apply afterwards a correction factor, as described in section 5.2. 2 An event is accepted if it satisfies a software trigger condition, defined as a raw energy deposit above 850 MeV in at least three consecutive scintillator layers. This value was chosen by taking into account the efficiency curves of the discriminators used to generate the hardware trigger during LHC operations. Since hadron detection efficiency falls sharply for true hadron incident energies below 500 GeV, we report our final result only above this value. However, in all analysis steps we considered all reconstructed energies over 250 GeV, because we found that this choice improves the unfolding accuracy on the final result. The reason is that, due to the limited hadron energy resolution of the detector, low energy tails in the deposits of high energy hadrons lead to a significant contribution in the 250-500 GeV range of the folded distribution.",

Both effects are due to improper position and/or energy reconstruction, which are significant only in the low energy region. As discussed in section 5.1, the limited hadron detection efficiency contributes as well to the missed events. Actually, it constitutes the largest contribution to correction factors: indeed, due to the small depth of the detector, a large fraction of hadrons either interacts late or does not interact at all in the calorimeter. Above 2 TeV, the detection efficiency is mostly constant around a 70% value, whereas, below 2 TeV, it strongly decreases due to the smaller energy deposits left in the scintillators. Note that fake and missed events corrections are expressed as a function of different definitions of energy (reconstructed and true) because they are respectively applied before and after unfolding. They were both estimated making use of the ideal (multihit corrected) sample described before, using the average between QGSJET II-04 and EPOS-LHC as the final correction factors.

For this purpose, we used the iterative Bayesian method [23], implemented in the RooUnfold package [24]. Some changes to the default implementation were made, in order to separate the choice of the prior used as initial hypothesis of the algorithm from the distribution employed to construct the response matrix of the detector. This modification was necessary because we need to distinguish between the different contributions to the systematic uncertainty coming from the unfolding procedure itself, as discussed in section 5.4. The best estimation for the final unfolded distributions was obtained choosing a flat prior as initial hypothesis and constructing the response matrix from the single neutron flat energy sample simulated using the DPMJET 3.04 model. In order to estimate the uncertainties related to the deconvolution, the unfolding procedure was repeated several times for different priors, response matrices, or test input spectra. It was therefore important to define a general convergence criteria that could be valid for all the different cases tested: we decided to stop the iterative procedure when \u2206\u03c7 2 , the \u03c7 2 change between the outputs of two consecutive iterations, is below 1. This threshold was chosen as a compromise between convergence requirements and number of iterations needed to reach that convergence. As an example, in the case of the data points in the final unfolded distributions, this convergence criteria corresponds to 51, 12 and 10 iterations for Region A, B and C, respectively. Differently from the default procedure, we also chose to apply the fake and missed events corrections outside of the unfolding algorithm, although we verified that the results are consistent with the standard approach.

The first is due to calorimeter calibration (3.7%), comprising the absolute gain calibration for each scintillator layer, the non-uniformity of the position dependent correction factors, and the residuals in the conversion from the deposited energy to primary energy. The second comes from different hardware effects present during data taking at the LHC (2.0%), like ADCs non-linearity, cables attenuation, high voltages stability, PMTs gain calibration. The third is related to the observed shift in the position of the \u03c0 0 mass peak with respect to the simulations (+1.6%), as reconstructed from the two gamma invariant mass distribution [25]. Despite the fact that this shift is well within the consistency bounds of the two previously mentioned systematic uncertainties, we decided to consider this contribution as an additional source of error in our analysis. This conservative approach is justified, in the case of hadronic showers, because we do not have a clear energy signature that can be used to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The total energy scale error, obtained from the quadratic sum of these three terms, is \u00b14.5%. The systematic uncertainty on the unfolded spectra was estimated by shifting the energy scale by the corresponding error and comparing it with the nominal distribution. As we can see from table 4, the energy scale is the main source of uncertainty, especially in the high energy region where the slope of the distributions is steep. The systematic uncertainty strongly depends on energy, ranging from about 1% to about 100%.",

The third, here called unfolding interaction uncertainty (up to 70%), depends on the choice of the hadronic interaction model used to construct the response matrix. We estimated this term by comparing the unfolded results obtained simulating the detector interaction using two different models: DPMJET 3.04, employed for all simulations described in section 4, and QGSJET II-04. We decided against superimposing this uncertainty on the final results because, as described in appendix B, the large effects found are mainly due to the poor agreement between QGSJET II-04 and the experimental data obtained in various beam tests, which are anyway well reproduced by DPMJET 3.04. The fourth, here called unfolding algorithm uncertainty (up to 100%), derives from the different unfolded spectrum that we can obtain using different algorithms. We estimated this term comparing the unfolded results obtained using the iterative Bayesian method with those obtained using SVD [31] and TUnfold [32] (also implemented inside the RooUnfold package). In principle, this uncertainty should already be included in the first two, but we decided to conservatively consider it as an additional independent source of error. This is because the algorithm performances, tested using simulations, could change unpredictably when applied to real data, given the marked differences with the experimental results shown by all models, especially in Region A.

Comparing the pre-LHC and post-LHC version of SIBYLL, we can observe a significant increase of the neutron production in all the pseudorapidity regions and this fact improves the agreement of the model with the current experimental measurements. Differently, QGSJET and EPOS are not affected by relevant changes. Whereas no significant variation is found also in PYTHIA, DPMJET exhibits a very different inclusive differential cross section in the two cases. Because no relevant change in the mechanisms responsible for forward neutron production is expected between \u221a s = 7 and 13 TeV, this variation must be due to the fact that the p T coverage is different in the two LHC runs, i.e. the p T intervals corresponding to a given pseudorapidity region at 13 TeV are almost twice the ones at 7 TeV.",

For \u03b7 > 10.76, the experimental energy distribution exhibits a peak structure at around 5 TeV that is not predicted by any of the models, which also underestimate the total production cross section: QGSJET II-04 shows the smallest deficit with respect to data for the whole energy range. In the other two regions, the experimental energy distributions exhibit a peak structure at around 1.5-2.5 TeV that is well reproduced by SIBYLL 2.3: SIBYLL 2.3 and EPOS-LHC show the best overall agreement for 8.99 < \u03b7 < 9.22 and 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99, respectively.",

It is employed for detector calibration, for the estimation of correction factors, for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties, and for spectra unfolding. Unfortunately, the agreement between different models is not good in the energy range considered in this analysis. Because of this reason, we decided to test them using experimental data at the highest energy achievable at beam test facilities. These data were acquired at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in July-August 2015, making use of muon, electron and proton beams at different energies. The total energy deposit of 350 GeV protons in the detector was compared to the one predicted by DPMJET 3.04 and QGSJET II-04 models in the same experimental configuration. The event selection applied to these distributions differs from the one described in section 5.1 for two main reasons: the reduction of the software trigger threshold (75 MeV for small tower, 150 MeV for large tower) to cope with the otherwise small detection efficiency at this energy; the reduction of the detector fiducial area to a small square around center (5 mm \u00d7 5 mm for small tower, 6 mm \u00d7 6 mm for large tower) in order to select a region of uniform response. The comparison between data and MC is shown in figure 8, whereas the parameters of the distributions are reported in table 5. As we can see, DPMJET 3.04 is in very good agreement with experimental measurements, whereas QGSJET II-04 leads to an energy deposit that is slightly higher than the one observed. Thus, in the current analysis, we decided to use the DPMJET 3.04 model every time we need to simulate the interaction of a particle with the detector. In particular, the deviation of the energy mean and the energy resolution between DPMJET 3.04 predictions and experimental measurements is at most 2%. Because this difference is compatible with the error on the gain of scintillator channels, we decided to neglect this additional contribution to the total systematic uncertainty on the energy scale. As a final remark, it is important to note that the choice of the model used to simulate the interaction with the detector is independent from the ability of the same model to reproduce the distributions of secondary particles produced in \u221a s = 13 TeV p-p collisions. This is because, apart from the fact that in the calorimeter the first interaction is between the incoming particle and tungsten, there is a difference of more than four orders of magnitude between the highest possible energy of a particle reaching the detector (6.5 TeV) and the energy of the primary proton in the laboratory frame where the other proton is at rest (90 PeV).

The different results are in good agreement between each other and demonstrates the validity of x F scaling hypothesis for p-p collisions in the range \u221a s = 30.6-200 GeV. Thus, when choosing the prior used as initial hypothesis of the iterative Bayesian unfolding, it would be in principle better to choose the one extrapolated from ISR measurements rather than the flat one. This extrapolation can be easily done using the same method described in reference [30], limiting the integration to the acceptance of Region A in LHCf, corresponding to p T < 0.276 GeV/c \u2022 x F in the case of p-p collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Here we call ISR prior the one obtained extrapolating the ISR results relative to p-p collisions at \u221a s = 44.9 GeV according to the procedure mentioned above. Unfortunately, as shown in figure 7, this prior was found to have a large bias on the final result, observed both on experimental data and generator simulations. In particular, being very different from all models, the ISR prior leads to an unfolded spectrum that is very different from the generator truth in the case of QGSJET II-04. This is likely due to the spectral shape of the prior, which shows a sharp peak at about x F = 0.80 that rapidly decreases to 0 at x F = 1. In addition, this problem was found only with the ISR prior, but not with an artificial prior obtained shifting the peak position from x F = 0.80 towards smaller or larger values. Thus, we concluded that the ISR prior is not a safe choice for our analysis because, in the case the distribution present in nature was different from ISR measurements, the unfolding procedure would lead to a result that is different from the true one. As shown in figure 7, all other priors lead to similar results and, in any case, the residual difference is considered as a source of systematic uncertainty on our final measurements. Note that all this discussion applies only to Region A, but not to Region B and C, whose p T coverage is outside the validity of the extrapolation suggested in reference [30].",
