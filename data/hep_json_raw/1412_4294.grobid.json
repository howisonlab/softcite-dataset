A few unexpected results in the study of quasi-elastic scattering and single photon production have spurred a revisiting of the underlying nuclear physics and connections to electron-nucleus scattering. A thorough understanding and resolution of these issues is essential for future progress in the study of neutrino oscillations. A recent workshop hosted by the Institute of Nuclear Theory at the University of Washington (INT-13-54W) examined experimental and theoretical developments in neutrino-nucleus interactions and related measurements from electron and pion scattering. We summarize the discussions at the workshop pertaining to the aforementioned issues in quasi-elastic scattering and single photon production, particularly where there was consensus on the highest priority issues to be resolved and the path towards resolving them.",

The largest contributions to the systematic error, summarized in Table VI, are the uncertainty in the muon momentum scale, and the normalization and uncertainty in the flux for each energy region. For simplicity, we treat all the errors as symmetric when quoting a final result because these largest errors are symmetric. Other, smaller contributions include the shape of the non-QE background, the non-QE=QE ratio, and the two-track to one-track migration. A final, interesting source of uncertainty comes from nuclear effects, though it contributes only a small amount to this analysis. The statistical error is estimated by setting all the other parameters in the fit to their best fit values and rec distributions for K2K-1 data (left) and K2K-IIa data (right) for the one-track, two-track QE enhanced, and two-track non-QE enhanced samples. The shaded region shows the QE fraction of each sample, estimated from the MC. The contribution from each energy region is summed for each plot. The lowest two data points in each plot are not included in the fit, due to the large uncertainty in the effects of the nucleus.",

Analysis of CCQE interactions at MiniBooNE with energies around \u223c 1 GeV on carbon indicated that the absolute differential cross sections were consistent not only with the harder Q 2 distribution implied by higher values of M A \u223c 1.35 GeV, but also with the absolute rate [15]. At around the same time, NOMAD reported measurements of CCQE interactions on a carbon target at higher energies (> 3 GeV) on carbon, which resulted in M A values closer to those obtained on deuterium (1.06 \u00b1 0.06 GeV/c 2 ) [16]. Details on these results, as well as other recent experimental developments in CCQE measurements, are presented in Section 2. The nature of what appears to be tension or disagreement between these two measurements on similar targets, but at different energies and very different detection methods, remains under discussion. The larger CCQE cross sections measured by MiniBoonE led to the recollection of two past developments that identified potential mechanisms for higher cross sections. First were calculations performed using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) framework which predicted additional interactions channels corresponding to multi-nucleon knockout (often referred to as \"np \u2212 nh\") [17]. These would give rise to pionless final states that would be classified as \"CCQE\" in the topological classification used at MiniBooNE, thus leading to an excess of such events that could be interpreted as a higher absolute cross section. The RPA-based calculations were revisited in response to the MiniBooNE CCQE results and found to predict an additional np \u2212 nh contribution that could explain the excess of \"CCQE\" events observed at MiniBooNE.",

CCQE events are identified as those containing exactly one muon and one Michel decay electron arising from \u00b5 \u2192 e decay. The requirement of one Michel decay electron eliminates backgrounds from events containing a charged pion in the final state, since the charged pion decay will lead to a second Michel electron in the event. With this selection, CCQE events are defined as CC events with no pions and any number of nucleons in the final state. No attempt is made to reconstruct or count the final state proton(s) in these events. The dominant non-QE background in the neutrino (antineutrino) sample are CC \u03c0 + (CC \u03c0 \u2212 ) events where the pion is absorbed in the target nucleus. Such events have the same final state as CCQE interactions in the MiniBooNE detector and are part of the sample often called \"CCQE-like\" events. The size of this background is partially constrained by the measured rate of CC events with an observed pion in the final state in the MiniBooNE detector.

The integrated flux uncertainty is \u223c 10% in both cases after multiple years of work to incorporate improved hadro-production measurements (for example, data taken using a replica of the MiniBooNE proton target at HARP) and beam modeling using a custom GEANT4-based beam simulation [27]. The flux uncertainties grow to larger than 10% at both the low and high end of the predicted energy spectrum. Note that no use is made of MiniBooNE neutrino data to determine the neutrino flux. This is in part due to the insufficient statistics in \"standard candle\" processes with a priori well-known cross sections, such as inverse muon decay (IMD) and deep inelastic scattering (DIS), to measure the flux and the desire to not use the same event samples to both measure a flux and a cross section.",

The MINERvA detector sits just upstream of the MINOS near detector so that muons from MINERvA that enter the magnetized MINOS near detector can be charge-and momentum-analyzed. For MINERvA's first published quasi-elastic cross sections, only events with muons matched to MINOS tracks were used. The fiducial mass of the MINERvA scintillator is 5.56 tons, although there are also several passive nuclear targets that are in the upstream region of the detector which can be used to study neutrino interactions on different nuclei. The MINERvA detector sits in the NuMI beam line, which in the low energy configuration produced a broad band \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 beams which peak at 3.5 GeV [38]. MINERvA took data in both \u03bd \u00b5 and a\u03bd \u00b5 configurations, and with the magnetic field of the MINOS near detector was able to measure both neutrino and antineutrino cross sections with essentially no wrong-sign contamination.",

The muon momentum is determined based on the distance the muon travels in MINERvA plus the momentum measured in the MINOS near detector. The muon angle at the vertex is determined using the MINERvA tracking. From these two quantities the neutrino energy (E QE \u03bd ) and momentum transfer squared (Q 2 QE ) can be approximated using the CCQE hypothesis (Equations 6 and 7), assuming E b = 34(30) MeV for neutrinos (antineutrinos).",

The recoil energy includes energy depositions not associated with the muon that occur at least 30 cm (10 cm) away from the muon track vertex in neutrino (antineutrino) mode. The vertex energy includes energy depositions that are less than that distance from the muon track vertex. In order to eliminate potential bias due to mismodeled nuclear effects that could cause extra activity near the vertex, MINERvA makes no requirement on vertex energy, but selects CCQE events by making a Q 2 QE -dependent cut on the recoil energy designed to maintain 95% efficiency in selecting CCQE event at each Q 2 QE . In order to subtract the non-CCQE backgrounds from the CCQE sample, a fit to the sideband regions is done in bins of Q 2 . The fits reduces the non-CCQE backgrounds relative to the default predictions by 5% for Q 2 QE < 0.8 GeV 2 /c 2 and 15% for Q 2 QE = [0.8, 2.0] GeV 2 /c 2 .

The largest systematic error is from the flux and is largely constant over the different Q 2 QE regions. There is more discriminating power in the measurement by comparing the assigned Q 2 dependence of different models to the data. In particular, the MINERvA data are compared to two models which can both describe the enhanced cross section observed in the MiniBooNE CCQE data: one which includes an enhanced transverse cross section constrained by electron-nucleus data (red dashed line in Figure 7) and the RFG model with M A = 1.35 GeV (green line in Figure 7) . Both of these models can describe the MiniBooNE CCQE data in shape and rate, but MiniBooNE is unable to distinguish between the two choices given the incident neutrino beam energy and detector technology. This issue is very important to resolve for neutrino oscillation experiments given that the two effects (whether one changes the transverse response or axial form factor) have very different consequences on the energy dependence of the CCQE cross section, the determination of E \u03bd , and the final state particle composition. With its higher beam energy and added detector capability, MINERvA is able to resolve this issue. The MINERvA data more strongly favors an increase in the transverse response than an increased axial mass. This highlights the power of having data at multiple beam energies: while enhancements in the transverse cross section and axial mass have similar effects at 1 GeV, this is not the case at higher neutrino energies where the two effects can be differentiated. This has been nicely demonstrated in the case of the MINERvA CCQE data and the conclusions seem to hold for both neutrino and antineutrino scattering.",

The axial mass MA was calculated from the measured cross sections: we find MA = 1.05 \u00b1 0.06 GeV from the \u03bd\u00b5 sample and MA = 1.06 \u00b1 0.14 GeV from the\u03bd\u00b5 sample.

The muon in this case is not required to enter MINOS, since the kinematics of the event are determined by the proton kinetic energy rather than by the muon momentum and angle. This analysis finds that the model that best describes the hadron kinematics of these CCQE-like events is in fact not the model that best describes the muon kinematics described above [41]. This could be from either a mis-modeling of the inelastic component of the sample (which consists of pions that are absorbed inside the nucleus), or a mis-modeling of the final state interactions of the leading proton.",

While the GENIE model reproduces the low-multiplicity behavior in both neutrino and antineutrino data well, it predicts a significant fraction of events with large (> 5) proton multiplicity that is not observed in data. GiBUU, on the other hand, seems to model the absence of these large proton multiplicity interactions well. It is noted that the two models predict significantly different compositions for the \"CC0\u03c0\" sample, with GiBUU predicting a contribution of non-CCQE events (50%) nearly twice that of GENIE (30%).

The experiment is the first to utilize the \"off-axis\" beam configuration [46], in which the beam axis is directed away from the detectors. The muon neutrinos result primarily from the decay \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 of pions produced in the interactions of 30 GeV protons from the J-PARC main ring on a carbon target. The properties of relativistic twobody kinematics result in a beam of \u03bd \u00b5 with lower and more narrowly peak energy spectrum as one moves away in angle from the axis of the pion decays. This property is exploited at T2K to give a beam of neutrinos with a narrow spectrum peaked at \u223c 600 MeV optimized to maximize neutrino oscillation effects at L = 295 km. The neutrino flux prediction [28] is extensively tuned to NA61 particle production meausurements [26,47] and other hadronic interaction and cross section measurements, as well as in situ monitors which measure the optics of the incident primary protons and beam direction. The predicted neutrino flux is shown on the left in Figure 10, where uncertainties of 10 \u2212 15% have been achieved. Continuous improvements in the uncertainty are expected as additional NA61 data is analyzed and incorporated into the prediction.",

For charged tracks entering the TPCs, the magnetic field allows sign selection and momentum reconstruction of charged tracks by measuring their curvature. Measurements of the track ionization yield in the TPC also provide powerful particle identification capabilities. The tracks are matched to hits in the FGDs to form combined FGD-TPC tracks, while tracks originating from the FGDs that do not enter the TPC are reconstructed from FGD hits only. Once a negative outgoing muon is identified in the FGD and TPC, the \u03bd \u00b5 CC sample is divided into three topological categories based on other particles identified in an event. Events without additional matched tracks, nor with a delayed electron resulting from the \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2192 e decay chain, are classified as \"CC0\u03c0\". Based on additional pion tracks or decay electrons found in the event, the remaining events are categorized as \"CC1\u03c0\" if the topology is consistent with CC interaction with a single \u03c0 + , otherwise it is categorized as \"CC other\".

QE scattering experiments have been carried out for many years on a variety of targets and incident energies. Reference [54]     often to measure the momentum distribution of nucleons in the target nucleus. As shown in Figure 14, it was very early noted that in every nucleus there appeared nucleons with momenta well beyond the Fermi momentum that are incompatible with scattering off a free nucleon moving in a mean field. Theorists soon identified the high momentum nucleons as arising from correlated pairs of nucleons whose high momenta originate in the strong short-range nucleonnucleon interaction. Direct observation of these correlated pairs has only become possible in the last decade and there now exist spectacular demonstrations of their existence in nuclei. Ingo Sick's presentation addressed the overall importance of these correlations. While there is approximately a 20% probability for a nucleon to be involved in such a correlation, in carbon, for example, they are responsible for 37% of the energy required to remove a nucleon from the nucleus. The existence of these correlated pairs also accounts for approximately 20% of the depleted occupancy of the nuclear shell model orbits. Figure 14 shows a calculation of the normalized nucleon momentum distribution in selected light nuclei as shown by Ingo Sick. The shape of the high momentum distribution (k > 1.5 fm \u22121 ) is very similar in all four cases and almost identical for 4 He and 16 O. The fraction of correlated pairs is smaller in 2 H because of the dilute structure of this system. The high momentum components are due to the correlated pairs of nucleons (mostly n \u2212 p pairs with S = 1, T = 0) in the nucleus. The nucleon-nucleon interaction inside 1.5 fm is strongly attractive, but becomes sharply repulsive when the two nucleons overlap. As we shall see, it is crucial to take account of these nucleon-nucleon correlations when calculating lepton-nucleus quasi-elastic scattering.",

            "text": "Three kinds of scaling have been uncovered in electron-nucleus scattering and each provides valuable lessons. It is straightforward to extract the values for q and \u03c9 in electron scattering experiments. Scaling of the first kind employs the conservation of energy and momentum and assumes the observed QE cross section is simply an incoherent sum of the scattering off the individual nucleons in a nucleus. This simplification reduces the dependence of the cross section to variable \u0408. Since \u0408 is defined in Eqs. \u035119\u0352 and \u035120\u0352 in terms of the Fermi momentum, appropriate values of k F had to be selected: specifically, we use 220, 230, 235, and 240 MeV/c for C, Al, Fe, and Au, with intermediate values for the intermediate nuclei. The definition of the scaling variable also involves the choice of an appropriate ''shift'' energy \u0353see Eq. \u035118\u0352\u0354. This energy accounts for the effects of both the binding in the initial state and the interaction strength in the final state. In practice we use an energy that goes from 15 to 25 MeV for nuclei C, . . . ,Au; the results are quite insensitive to the exact choice. Figure 2 shows the scaling function f (\u0408) defined in Eq. \u035125\u0352 for all kinematics \u0351energies, angles, momentum trans-fers\u0352 and all available nuclei meeting our selection criteria. We observe reasonably successful superscaling behavior for values of \u0408\u03fd0, while for \u0408\u03fe0 the superscaling property is badly violated. The latter is to be expected, as there pro-cesses other than quasielastic scattering-meson-exchange current \u0351MEC\u0352, \u232c excitation, deep inelastic scatteringcontribute to the cross section, whereas the scaling as discussed in this paper only applies to quasielastic scattering.",

The transverse response is observed to increase with three-momentum transfer at least up to q = 570 MeV/c in contrast to the scaling predicted in the RFG impulse approximation. The RFG also predicts that both nuclear responses should be identical when the longitudinal and transverse responses of free nucleons are taken into account.

The desired physics is produced by the final state interaction of the struck nucleon with the relativistic mean field.

            "text": "These relativistic potentials have enjoyed considerable success in describing many aspects of nucleon-nucleus scattering [63]. As phenomenologically determined from low energy nucleon-nucleus scattering, the central scalar potential is strongly attractive (\u223c \u2212400 MeV) while the central vector potential is repulsive (\u223c 350 MeV) at low energy. Figure 21a shows the central vector and scalar potentials as a function of nuclear radius, while Figure 21b shows the net effect with the net central potential becoming repulsive at about 250 MeV. However, recalling what is stated above, to obtain the best fit to longitudinal and transverse response functions, the same optical potential is used to generate the initial bound state and the spectrum of final states. While the RMF impulse approximation is most convenient, it is puzzling that for non-relativistic approaches to produce the same physics, they must employ nucleon-nucleon interactions and two-body currents [18]. Apparently, much of the benefit of the RMF comes from the strong modification of the lower component wave function in the presence of the strong vector and scalar fields in the nucleus.",

            "text": "Clearly a great deal relevant to neutrino-nucleus scattering has been learned via the scaling analyses of inclusive electron QE scattering from nuclei. Such measurements are feasible with electrons where the critical variables q and \u03c9 are readily obtained from measurement of the momentum of the scattered electron. Unfortunately, for most neutrino experiments these quantities are out of reach. Thus, scaling cannot at the moment be applied to neutrino experiments due to a lack of knowledge of the incident neutrino energy which limits how well q and \u03c9 can be established. The appearance of short-range (high momentum) pairwise correlations among 20% of the nucleons in a nucleus is especially important. These correlations are known to be the cause of the enhancement appearing in the nuclear transverse response. These correlations will be shown to be important in neutrino-nucleus CCQE scattering. Also of importance and a cause for optimism is the fact that these correlations appear universally in all nuclei.",

The simplest view of neutrino CCQE scattering on a nucleus is that it is simply an incoherent sum of the CCQE scattering on the individual nucleons in the nucleus. Nucleon vector form factors are readily available from electron scattering, and the neutron lifetime and the Q 2 dependence of neutrino scattering on deuterium fixes the axial form factors. The publication of the MiniBooNE CCQE cross section data in 2009 [65,33] dramatically called attention to the fact that the observed data were some 45% above the consensus value predicted for the cross section [67] as shown in Figure 22. Much of the difference is ascribable to the different definition of CCQE used by the theorists and MiniBooNE. While theorists typically defined \"CCQE\" as a process giving rise to a muon and proton final state, MinBooNE termed events to be \"CCQE\" when there was a muon in the final state and no pion, with corrections applied to remove the contribution of events in which a pion was created and subsequently absorbed. Thus, the experimental signature sought by MiniBooNE was more inclusive than that employed by theorists.",

The various nuclear response functions depend on Q 2 and \u03c9 ; R C , the charge response; R L ,the isospin-spin longitudinal response; and R T , the isospin-spin transverse response. The R L response arises from the effect of soft pion exchange on the axial current [72,73] and is not a large contribution. On the third line, the enhancement known to exist for the magnetic response is also attributed to the axial response. This enhancement of both the axial and magnetic contributions is further amplified in the interference term for neutrino scattering (last term in Equation 19). These transverse enhancements are attributed to the effects of the tensor force arising from meson exchanges and are included diagrammatically with examples shown in Figure  24  [68]. This formalism reproduces the MiniBooNE data without any need to increase the axial mass in the nucleon form factors because of the enhancement of both the axial and magnetic responses.  (6).

We take into account this modification through the parametrization of the in-medium width of Oset and Salcedo [70], which leads to a good description of pion-nuclear reactions. The authors split the width into different decay channel contributions: the \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 N , which is modified by the Pauli blocking of the nucleon and the distortion of the pion. Moreover, in the nuclear medium, new decay channels are possible: the two-body (2p-2h) and three-body (3p-3h) absorption channels that they also incorporate. They give a parametrization for the inclusion of these effects, both in the case of pion interaction with nuclei and for the photoproduction process. We have used their parametrization in spite of the fact that in neutrino interaction the intermediate boson has a spacelike character. An explicit evaluation of the corresponding contributions in the kinematical situation of neutrino scattering is desirable. There exist also other 2p-2h contributions that are not reducible to a modification of the width. We include them, as in the work of Marteau [38], following the method of Delorme and Guichon [71] who perform an extrapolation of the calculations of Ref. [72] on the 2p-2h absorption of pions at threshold. For the last contribution only the imaginary part of the corresponding propagator is incorporated. The explicit expressions are given ",

The effects of pion exchange on vector and axial vector currents are known [72,73] to be quite different While very successful in reproducing the MiniBooNE data, it is not clear that this approach is robust. The weak current employed by Martini et al. is one-body so it is not clear to what degree conservation of the vector current is respected.

They have published a series of papers [75,76,21,21,77,92] that cover all essential aspects of neutrino-nucleus CCQE scattering, particularly with regard to the MiniBooNE data. Many aspects of their work are similar to those of Martini et al. as both employ a Fermi gas model with long and short-range interactions implemented via the RPA. Figure 25 shows their results for the CCQE cross section on 12 C calculated with the MiniBooNE neutrino flux. Of note is the large difference between their calculation and that from Martini et al. in the contribution from 2p\u22122h configurations. We speculate that this may be the result of IFIC having no enhancement of the axial response  in their calculation. Such enhancement is still an issue under investigation. In the presentation of the RPA formalism and results, terms such as \"n-particle, n-hole\" final states are often used, creating some confusion with n-body currents employed in other formalisms.",

The group has a background in electron scattering [18] and only recently turned its attention to neutrino CCQE scattering from nuclei. NUCLEI's approach is very different from any other presented at the workshop. They employ a parameterized version of the nucleon-nucleon interaction (VA18), including 3-body forces (TNI), and solve for the low-lying states of the nucleus using quantum Green's Function Monte Carlo (GFMC) techniques. The computational complexity of such an approach is currently limited to light nuclei (A \u2264 12). This Figure 26: The calculated binding energies of the ground and excited states of the nuclei from 4 He to 12 C using the Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon interaction and the Illinois-7 3-body interaction shown by J. Carlson [78].  very fundamental approach has proven very successful in reproducing the spectra and transitions of the low lying states of light nuclei as shown in Figure 26. The energy of the nuclear states from 4 He to 12 C are predicted to better than 0.5 MeV over a scale of \u223c 70 MeV. Of course, this success is no measure of how well quasi-elastic scattering will be predicted. The most convincing demonstration of the utility of this approach is from quasi-elastic electron scattering from 3 He and 4 He. Figure 27 shows the experimentally extracted longitudinal and transverse response functions in terms of \u03c8 , the scaling variable introduced in Section 3 [18]. In each case, the contributions of charge, magnetic moment, and form factor of the individual nucleon have been removed from the response functions. The large change between 3 He and 4 He is presumably due to the increased binding energy and resulting higher density of the 4 He nucleus. The longitudinal response is broadened in Figure 27: The experimentally extracted longitudinal (green, lower band) and transverse (red, uppper band) responses for 3 He (left) and 4 He (right) [18]. Recall in a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) impulse approximation description of quasi-elastic scattering, the longitudinal and transverse responses are identical. 4 He though the integral over \u03c8 remains the same, while the transverse response is both broadened and increased in integral. The change in the longitudinal response shows that the nucleon momentum in 4 He is higher and that there are more collisions in which the energy transfer is greater than would be inferred from the impulse approximation. The large increase in the relative transverse to longitudinal response shows that effects beyond individual nucleon physics must be at play. Table 3 shows the calculated sum rule for the longitudinal and transverse responses for 3 He and 4 He at different 3-momentum transfers. The longitudinal and transverse sum rules are integrals over the transferred energy at fixed three-momentum transfer as follows:",

The ANC two-body contributions in the sum rules studied here are much larger than the contributions associated with axial two-body currents in weak chargechanging transitions to specific states at low-momentum transfers, such as \u03b2 decays and electron-and muon-capture processes involving nuclei with mass numbers A=3-7 [36,49], where they amount to a few percent (but are nevertheless necessary to reproduce the empirical data).",

There are two papers in the literature addressing this shortcoming in CCQE electron scattering [83,74] and presenting the formalism. Applying these corrections to the MiniBooNE data did not appear to produce a sufficient increase in the yield. Figure 32 shows the increased yield produced by meson exchange currents (MEC) in a more stringent test where it is compared to the MiniBooNE differential cross section measurements. There appear to be several theoretical and computational issues that need to be addressed before this phase of the work is complete. In particular, the contribution to the transverse axial response needs to be better understood.    the inclusion of two-body currents improves the agreement with the data at low scattering angles, but some strength is missing at higher angles, especially for low muon momenta. Again some caution should be expressed before drawing definitive conclusions from the agreements or disagreements seen in Figs. 3 and 4. For instance, as already mentioned, there are strong indications from RMF studies as well as from QE (e, e \u2032 ) data that scaling of the zeroth kind is only approximate and that the vector transverse response should be enhanced over the strict SuSA strategy employed in the present work. Moreover, in different lan-guage, namely that of extended RFG modeling where 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations are incorporated, a fully consistent treatment should take into account not only the MEC contributions of the present study but also the correlation diagrams that are necessary in order to preserve the gauge invariance of the theory. In an infinite system like the RFG these diagrams give rise to divergencies which need to be regularized. A treatment of these contributions has been performed recently for (e, e \u2032 ) in [36], where they were shown to be of the same order as the MEC. The model of [36] contains similar ingredients in the treatment of 2p-2h Figure 32: SUSA predictions with the inclusion of MEC compared MiniBooNE CCQE differential cross section measurements [88].",

Recall that the RMF is used to account for the effects of strong interaction dynamics on lepton-nucleus scattering. Quite good results were obtained for electron-nucleus scattering with an asymmetric longitudinal response function and an enhanced transverse response. However Figure 33 shows that the total CCQE response lies closest to the (e, e ) longitudinal response. This implies that the RMF produces no enhancement of the axial response. In that case, it is impossible to reproduce the MiniBooNE CCQE measurements as not only is the enhancement of the axial response missing, but the further enhancement it provides to the interference term is also absent.",

There is a large body of their work starting with QE electron scattering in the early 90s [84] through their most recent publication [85] discussing the MINERvA CCQE data. There is extensive experience in the application of RMF to various inclusive and exclusive QE processes. While the particular recipe being applied may not be obvious to a non-expert, the eventual (e, e \u2032 ) vs (\u03bd, \u00b5). SuSA vs RMF  fit to data using a relativistic Green's function (RGF) is remarkably good [86] as shown in Figure 34. The EDA1 and EDAD1 are two different optical model potentials. The former is energy dependent but A-independent while the latter is energy independent but A-dependent and in this case is chosen to best fit elastic scattering of protons from 12 C. From Figure 33, it is evident that crucial effects must be obtained from the final state interaction of the outgoing nucleon with the potential generated by the A \u2212 1 residual nucleons. In this model, it is hoped that that the complex physics is all captured in the final state interaction with a relativistic optical potential.",

There seemed to be no question that two-body correlations and extension of the impulse approximation be added to any Fermi gas or non-relativistic mean values of E , are obtained in the RGF with both optical potentials. The differences between RGF-EDAI and RGF-EDAD1 are here clearly visible, RGF-EDAI being in good agreement with the shape and magnitude of the experimental cross section and RGF-EDAD1 being above RMF but clearly below the data. The differences between EDAI and EDAD1 are due to the different values of the imaginary parts of both potentials, particularly for the energies considered in kinematics with the lowest and the largest T . These kinematics, which were not considered in previous RGF calculations, give large contributions to the total cross section and emphasize the differences between the RGF predictions with both optical potentials. Notice that EDAI is a single-nucleus parameterization, which does field model of the nuclear ground state. Some place all of the enhancement of the cross section into the transverse vector response as this had clearly been observed in electron scattering. A major issue to be settled is the enhancement of the transverse axial response relative to that predicted in the impulse approximation. Its role in neutrino CCQE is very large due to constructive interference with the transverse vector response. The experimental community, particularly those associated with LAr-TPCs, is certainly interested in extensions beyond predicting the inclusive CCQE cross section and desire a more exclusive description that requires dealing with final state interactions at a minimum in order to predict the particle emission, As the inclusive CCQE cross section allows integration over all final CCQE channels, a reliable more exclusive treatment requires far more information and computation.",

The assigned neutrino energy for a given measured muon momentum is of course smeared by the Fermi momentum of the nucleon. Referring back to Figure 15 in Doug Higinbotham's presentation on (e, e pp), one can directly see the size of errors that can be made in assigning an incident neutrino energy if one can only observe the final state charged lepton energy. Using the momentum of the final state muon to infer the incident neutrino energy can greatly underestimate that energy if the muon was produced by CCQE scattering off a neutron in a correlated pair. The correlated pair can be viewed as being far off-shell and the scattering interaction must put both nucleons back on-shell. As an example of how such considerations may effect the assignment of neutrino energy, Figure 35 from Martini et al.

The mean bias and RMS in \u2206m 2 32 of \u22120.05 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and 0.014 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 , respectively, can be compared to the errors obtained in the actual analysis of \u00b10.082 eV 2 . Likewise, the bias and RMS in sin 2 \u03b8 23 is 0.0012 and 0.016, respectively, which can be compared to the uncertainty obtained in the fitted data of \u00b10.082. Thus, in the context of the model described in Nieves et al., the multi-nucleon contributions do not significantly impact the \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance analysis at T2K at this point; the parameter bias and additional uncertainty are small compared to the uncertainties arising from statistics and other systematic errors. However, a wider range of models need to be explored, and as the precision of the measurement increases as more data is accumulated at T2K, a 32 (left) and sin 2 \u03b8 23 (right) where multi-nucleon processes are included in the simulated data sets that are fit to two hypotheses that do and do not account for the multi-nucleon contributions. This illustrates the potential additional uncertainty and bias in the T2K Run 1-3 \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance analysis [94], which did not account for multi-nucleon effects. The multi-nucleon processes are simulated according to the model of Nieves et al. [91].",

However, the possibility of employing large fine-grained tracking detectors and LAr-TPCs in neutrino experiments has greatly increased the interest in improving the FSI treatment in neutrino event generators. Ideally these new detectors could reliably specify the incident neutrino energy, allow better specification of the interaction at the weak vertex, and allow the assignment of q and \u03c9 to each event. Indeed, data from SciBooNE (Section 2.3) and MINERvA (Section 2.4) are already providing evidence of the shortcomings of currently implemented FSI models. Detailed information on proton emission, such as shown in Figure 38 that was presented by Ornella Palamara at the workshop gives us a preview of the detailed topological and kinematic information we will obtain on CCQE final states. A first topological analysis is currently developed by the ArgoNeuT experiment, namely 1\u00b5 + Np + 0\u21e1, where we select events with one muon, any number of protons but without pions. The analysis takes two steps. First a similar event selection to the inclusive CC cross section measurements is applied to select events with muons. The selected events are then scanned to remove pion background and reconstruct the proton kinematics. The particle identification is done taking advantage of the detailed calorimetry information provided by the LArTPC. The particle species is determined by the energy deposition information as a function of residual range along the track trajectory if the particle stops inside the TPC. The kinetic energy is measured by summing the charge collected on each wire after correcting for electron lifetime and recombination e\u21b5ects. The threshold to reconstruct a proton in ArgoNeuT is T p = 21 MeV, where T p is the proton kinetic energy. Figure 3 shows the distributions of proton multiplicity for 1\u00b5+Np+0\u21e1 sample in comparison with genie predictions. The genie predictions have longer tails compared to ArgoNeuT data. This information is useful to improve the neutrino event generators.",

We have measured the \u232b \u00b5 and\u232b \u00b5 CC inclusive cross sections on argon. We also developed techniques to measure topological cross sections, which have yields results that are useful for understanding nuclear e\u21b5ects in neutrinonucleus interactions. Currently there are many ongoing ArgoNeuT analyses. We are searching for events with one muon and two protons where the two protons go back-to-back. This would be an indication for nucleon-nucleon correlation in neutrino scattering. Other analyses include a search for neutral hyperon production, electron/photon identification, measurements of NC \u21e1 0 cross sections, nuclear deexcitation s, coherent pion production, and \u232b e measurements. There is not a great body of work dealing with FSI in CCQE neutrino interactions. The Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck Project (GiBUU) is the most systematic and extensive effort [43]. Ulrich Mosel presented the model and its application to neutrino-nucleus interactions. As the names Boltzmann, Uehling and Uhlenbeck imply, GiBUU employs transport theory and provides a transport equation for each baryon and meson in a nuclear medium. The model has considerable generality and has been applied in a wide variety of reactions with considerable success. At present, GiBUU's principal role in CCQE is treating pion absorption following resonance formation at the electroweak vertex. These absorptive processes create a background to CCQE scattering as nucleons are the only hadrons present in the final state. Mosel made a strong case for upgrading present event generators to improve their treatment of FSI by incorporating GiBUU. This seems an entirely reasonable suggestion, given the huge cost and importance of many proposed neutrino experiments (LBNF, LBNO) that have the possibility of observing many of the final state products.",

One explanation is that the excess is due to to energetic photons (200-475 MeV) produced in neutral current (NC \u03b3) reactions [99,100,101]. Since the Mini-BooNE detector is not capable of distinguishing such photons from electrons emerging from \u03bd e CCQE interactions, the estimate of this background relies heavily on theoretical estimates. It is natural to assume on general grounds that the yield of such a process would be of order G 2 F \u00d7 \u03b1; the first detailed calculations of this process were similarly considered in the study of \u03bd + e elastic scattering. The issue is of considerable importance since sterile neutrinos are required to explain the excess of the electron-like events in MiniBooNE if it is due to \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) oscillations. Also, if the observed excess at MiniBooNE is due to an unmodeled source of photon production, this is an important background source to understand for current and future long baseline experiments studying \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation in the standard three neutrino flavor framework such as T2K, NOvA, LBNF [102], and Hyper-Kamiokande [103].",

Rather than calculate the rate from a nuclear model, MiniBooNE used its own measurement of NC \u03c0 0 production to infer the rate of NC \u2206 resonance production in carbon. Using the branching fraction of the radiative decay \u0393 \u03b3 /\u0393 \u2206 = 0.0056\u00b10.0004 for a free \u2206 at the resonance pole [104] and accounting for the various interactions of the \u2206 and the pion from its decay in the nuclear medium, (\u0393 \u03b3 /\u0393 \u03c0 0 ) \u2206, 12 C the ratio of \u03b3 to \u03c0 0 production in the decay of a \u2206 resonance in 12 C, is established and scaled by the observed \u03c0 0 production. This model was incorporated into the nuance [10] neutrino event generator to determine the rate and detailed topology of the NC \u03b3 background contribution.

However, as more data is accumulated and other sources of uncertainty shrink, this will likely become an important effect requiring careful treatment. The various models of these processes also differ significantly in the magnitude of the multi-nucleon contribution; thus theoretical convergence is also needed to predict the impact of multi-nucleon processes in CCQE with sufficient accuracy. The situation is similar for MiniBooNE, where an initial study of multi-nucleon effects concluded that these do not significantly impact the existing interpretation of the observed \u03bd e and\u03bd e candidates.

These measurements have already yielded a robust characterization of the nuclear spectral function, with approximately 20% of the nucleons in high momentum correlated pairs.

This presents both a challenge and opportunity: the enormous difficulties in producing a robust treatment of the exclusive hadronic states were manifestly obvious to all the participants.

First, new calculations must be provided in a form that can be incorporated into a neutrino event generator so that the results can be used by neutrino experiments. Experimentalists will require guidance in estimating the uncertainties in the prediction in order to use it effectively in an analysis. Finally, experiments will need predictions on the exclusive final states of neutrino-induced CCQE interactions. The path forward on the latter point was particularly unclear, but there was consensus that theoretical guidance and input on the above is crucial in moving forward.",

In neutrino studies, in contrast to electron scattering, different signatures occur for contributions where a pion is detected versus where it is not; the latter is called quasielastic, but is in that usage really the net effect obtained using the full electroweak current with one-and two-body contributions. In fact, even then there is an issue that pions can be produced, but be absorbed and so not detected and accordingly these contributions are counted as \"quasielastic\". Naturally some model is typically invoked to account for these effects that corrupt the strict meaning of quasielastic, although this means some model dependence has been introduced.",

This can be done because the many-body wave functions are especially simple, namely, on-shell (non-interacting) plane-wave states in Slater determinants. For models with interactions present one has a problem separating the MEC and correlation effects computed as matrix elements of two-body operators from effects already present in the wave functions themselves. In fact, the very concepts are not observables but are representation-dependent. A sophisticated interacting many-body description may already have some (but likely not all) correlation and MEC effects incorporated, in contrast to a simple model where they may not already be present. Another comment on MEC effects: These are not optional, but are required for any interacting system by gauge invariance. Any model with interactions must confront the requirement of having the corresponding two-body MEC contributions and many models (almost all) cannot do this consistently.",

Employing a standard Woods-Saxon shape, this prescription has been extremely successful in describing proton-nucleus elastic scattering cross sections and analyzing powers with a minimum number of parameters. When calculating inclusive electron quasi-elastic scattering, the impulse approximation and the same real scalar and vector potentials are used to generate the initial bound and final continuum states of the struck nucleon. All nuclear effects are in the interaction of the nucleon with the real mean field. Using an optical potential appropriate to the final state energy of the struck nucleon does not work as well. This prescription, while not obvious, allows for current conservation, orthogonality of the nucleon wave functions and generates the asymmetry of the longitudinal response and enhancement in the transverse response as seen in Figure 20. Apart from their phenomenological success, there is a body of theoretical work justifying the use of scalar and vector potentials. The scalar field is generated by a \u03c3 meson, a very broad T = 0, J \u03c0 = 0 + resonance formed by two pions, while the vector field is due to the \u03c9 meson with T = 0, J \u03c0 = 1 \u2212 .",

The open circles are the values for just the one-body currents while the closed circles are the values when two-body currents are included. As expected the charge response (S 00 ) shows no enhancement with the inclusion of two-body currents, while the important transverse summed responses (S xx and S xy ) show appreciable enhancement (40%). The transverse responses, S xx and S xy , include both the vector magnetic and the axial vector couplings.More surprising is the enhanced axial response, not explicit in the S xx and S xy ofFigure 28, but clearly present inFigure 29. The enhancement of the axial response is sizable and present at all three-momentum transfers and given its role in the coherent transverse interference response (S xy ), it is clear that its neglect leads to seriously under predicting the NCQE and CCQE cross sections on carbon. This axial enhancement results when two-body currents are included as is the case for the transverse vector response. The origin of this two-body current enhancement in the case of the axial response has not yet been identified by the authors. The result, if correct, supports the conjecture of Martini et al. and presents difficulty to all who would enhance the CCQE neutrino-nucleus inclusive cross section only via the transverse vector response. This may be the most significant result presented at the workshop.",

For information we also give the smeared distribution in the absence of the npnh contribution (dashed curve) which is more similar to the original data. However for us the more realistic curve is the one with the inclusion of the np-nh component. We stress that all the distributions shown inFig. 11 represent the same experimental data with the different treatment of the abscissa, the neutrino energy. The areas under these curves are the same. The salient feature is that our smeared distribution (with the np-nh component) is broadened and hardened, with the suppression of the low energy excess, as compared to the initial histogram. The effect arises from the high energy tail of our smearing function.The difference with the original distribution is so large that it could affect the interpretation in terms of oscillation. Our smeared distribution with the np-nh component is closer to the LSND[16] solutions shown in Ref.[11]  than the original histogram. At present this important conclusion is only tentative as the flux evaluation should and will be improved.",

This distribution has a high energy tail due to the np-nh cross section. For small or moderate E\u03bd values the distribution is not symmetrical around E\u03bd. The 1p-1h part itself is shifted towards larger neutrino energies by the Pauli blocking effects and the RPA influence. In addition the np-nh component is responsible for the high energy tail. For the smallest values of the reconstructed energy, E\u03bd 0.5 GeV, the np-nh tail is favored by the energy evolution of the neutrino flux which increases in this energy region, in particular for the T2K energy profile. With increasing values of the reconstructed energy the RPA hardening of the 1p-1h disappears and the form factor effect softens this part as explained previously.

The reason for the terminology comes from a simple (and somewhat naive) model: were the process to be simply electron scattering from a non-interacting nucleon at rest in a nucleus, a delta-function peak at the above energy loss would be the answer. The nucleons in the nucleus are in fact interacting and moving, and thus the delta function is smeared out (Fermi smearing). Actually things are more complicated than this and both initial-and final-state interactions are important; furthermore, the nucleons are not on-shell and thus their energies and momenta are not trivially related as some models suggest.",

Note that this does not equate to one-, two-, three-, etc. nucleon knockout, however, as one type of current operator can give rise to different numbers of nucleons effects are sometimes also included, although there may be issues with their validity at high energies. Once one goes to more sophisticated models the meaning of short-and long-range correlations change, these are not observables and are representation dependent. For instance, in one approach a strong repulsive core might be included to allow saturation of nuclear matter and might thereby influence the electroweak cross sections, especially in promoting strength to high missing energy (this needs defining as well; it can be covered in discussions). Alternatively, in relativistic mean field approaches (\u00e0 la Walecka) many of the correlation effects are already present via strong scalar and vector meson exchanges and therefore one should not be adding them willy nilly or one will run the risk of double counting. Note that this approach also saturates nuclear matter.",

As such, even very naive models such as the RFG can give reasonable answers. The models tend to satisfy basic symmetries such as unitarity, Lorentz covariance (often, but not always which is serious), maybe gauge invariance, etc. This being so, one tends to get roughly the correct answers since sum rules are being enforced. The main issues with such simple modeling for inclusive reactions is that the strength is often not quite correctly distributed in energy-momentum. In contrast, when (say) a nucleon in the final state is detected in coincidence with the final-state lepton one has a very different problem. The details of how that nucleon interacts with the rest of the nucleons in the final state is a much more complicated problem. Typical modeling that may be adequate for inclusive cross sections can be very bad for semi-inclusive studies.",
