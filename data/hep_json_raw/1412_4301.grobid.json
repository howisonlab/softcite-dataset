The hadronic system was often neglected or poorly modeled in the past, but they have significant effects on high precision neutrino oscillation and cross-section measurements. Among the physics of hadronic systems in neutrino interactions, the hadronization model controls multiplicities and kinematics of final state hadrons from the primary interaction vertex. For relatively high invariant mass events, many neutrino experiments rely on the PYTHIA program. Here, we show a possible improvement of this process in neutrino event generators, by utilizing expertise from the HERMES experiment. Finally, we estimate the impact on the systematics of hadronization models for neutrino mass hierarchy analysis using atmospheric neutrinos such as the PINGU experiment.",

On top of that, future long baseline oscillation experiments, such as PINGU [13], ORCA [14], Hyper-Kamiokande [15], and DUNE [16] are trying to use hadronic information from the atmospheric neutrino interactions around 2-20 GeV. Therefore correct modeling of hadronization processes is an important subject for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments.",

Fragmentation in PYTHIA is described by the Lund string fragmentation model, which is a model based on the dynamics of one-dimensional relativistic strings that are stretched between colored partons. These strings represent the color flux and in particular, are subject to a linear confinement potential. The hadronization process is described by break-ups in the strings through the production of a new quark-antiquark pairs. An iterative approach is used to perform the fragmentation as each break up is causally disconnected. The production rate of the created qq pair is determined using the tunneling mechanism, which leads to a Gaussian spectrum of the transverse momentum, p 2 \u22a5 (= p 2 x + p 2 y ), for the produced hadron. The fraction of E + p z taken by the produced hadron is given by the variable z, defined by the hadron energy E and energy transfer \u03bd (z = E/\u03bd). An associated fragmentation function f (z) gives the probability that a given z is chosen. The simplified Lund symmetric fragmentation function is given by,",

The input parameter is used to tune the function to agree with data, which is mainly taken from the Fermilab 15-foot bubble chamber experiment [23]. Although more recent hadron multiplicity data are available from CHORUS [24], the heavy target data require more sophisticated final state interaction models to access to the primary hadron multiplicity information, and we do not take these into account in this article. At higher energy regions the AGKY model gradually transitions from the KNO scalingbased model to PYTHIA discussed previously. A transition window based on the value of the invariant hadronic mass W is used, over which the fraction of events hadronized using the PYTHIA(KNO) model increases(decreases) linearly. The default values used in the AGKY model are  . This is the W distribution for \u03bd \u00b5 -water interactions simulated with GENIE. Here, we used a simple formula to model the atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 neutrino spectrum [25,26], described later. As you can see, the W -distribution in this energy region can be split into three main interaction modes, quasi-elastic (red hatched, left peak), resonance (blue hatched, middle), and DIS (green hatched, right). The AGKY model is applied to DIS interactions. Also note DIS is extended to the low W region to describe nonresonance interactions in the resonance region. Although charm production processes are possible at the high energies, contributions are minor and throughout this article we ignore charm production processes.

            "text": "Averaged charged hadron multiplicity data is fundamental in the development of hadronization models. It describes the average number of charged hadrons, mainly \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , measured as a function of invariant hadron mass W . Neutrino hadronization models are largely guided by such data from bubble chamber experiments. Recently, Kuzmin and Naumov performed detailed surveys of neutrino bubble chamber data, and chose the best sets of data to tune their model [33]. It is shown that all modern neutrino interaction generators, such as GENIE [19], NuWro [34], and GiBUU [35], all appear to underestimate averaged charged hadron multiplicity. Note, it is also shown that the NEUT neutrino interaction generator [36], which is used by T2K and Super-Kamiokande, also underestimates averaged charged hadron multiplicity [12].",

            "text": "This problem largely originates from the PYTHIA fragmentation model, because as mentioned in the previous section, the default PYTHIA parameters are tuned to higher energy experiments. Both GENIE and NuWro [37] tuned these PYTHIA parameters to improve the agreement with data but the effect is marginal. Note NuWro and GiBUU use their own models for fragmentation, and only later processes are based on PYTHIA. Fig. 3 shows the data-MC comparison of the averaged charged hadron multiplicity in \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 p and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 n interactions. Here, the two curves represent predictions from default GENIE and GENIE with a PYTHIA modified using the Lund-scan parameter set [29]. Note, because W < 2.3 GeV/c 2 range of the AGKY model is hadronized using the KNO scaling-based model, these two curves should be identical at W < 2.3 GeV/c 2 . As you can see, the HERMES tune describes the data better. Here, two data sets from the Fermilab bubble chamber and BEBC agree in \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 n interactions (both deuterium targets) but not in \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 p data (hydrogen and deuterium target), suggesting the conflict of data we see in      [20,21,33,38]. Despite the conflict of data, the HERMES parameterization in general increases the averaged charged hadron multiplicity, which improves the agreement with averaged charged hadron multiplicity data from neutrino bubble chamber experiments. Fig. 4 is the same plot for\u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 p interactions. Again, the agreement with the data is better for GENIE with the modified PYTHIA parameter set. Therefore, this new parameter set works better for both neutrino and antineutrino interactions.",

As shown in Fig. 1, these changes make the fragmentation function softer. This enhances emissions of soft hadrons, i.e., this increases averaged charged hadron multiplicity and thus it agrees better with data. In the higher energy experiments that PYTHIA is designed for, high order QCD effects cause additional low energy parton emissions. This causes hadrons to be produced with a broader spectrum in z. Because these effects are negligible for the neutrino experiments we are concerned with, we shift the peak of the fragmentation function to a lower z value by increasing (decreasing) the Lund a (b) parameter [30].",

Although the data here have larger errors, now the default GENIE has a better agreement with the data. The ratio of the number of produced charged pions and neutral pions is strongly tied due to isospin symmetry, i.e. N(\u03c0 + ) + N(\u03c0 \u2212 ) : N(\u03c0 \u2022 ) = 2 : 1. Thus, if we increase the charged hadron multiplicity, the model will also have higher multiplicities of neutral pions. The charged pion and neutral pion multiplicity ratio is 2:1 in BEBC neon target bubble chamber data [41], however, this relationship is not obvious in other bubble chamber data. As we see from Fig. 3 and 6, it is not easy to achieve good agreements with both charged hadron and neutral pion multiplicities by tuning PYTHIA parameters. On the other hand, PYTHIA shows excellent agreements in both charged and neutral pion fragmentation functions with HERMES data [27,45].  ",

In GENIE, the AGKY model uses a phenomenological approach based on KNO scaling [22], where dispersion is assumed to follow a scaling law as data suggest. Thus, by definition, the AGKY model has a better data-MC agreement for the dispersion of the multiplicity in the low W region. This is not the case in PYTHIA, where physics is simulated from a more first principles approach, which is based on quark-diquark fragmentation. By tuning PYTHIA parameters, the data-MC agreement of the averaged charged hadron multiplicity can be improved, but it is not easy to fully correct the dispersion. Fig. 7 shows the data-MC comparisons of the topological cross sections of charged hadrons, that is, the fraction of final particle topologies of a given interaction as function of invariant mass. In both plots, the GENIE predictions are compared with deuteron target \u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 p data from Fermilab 15' bubble chamber [23]. In the left plot, the hadronization model in GENIE is solely carried out by the KNO scaling-based model. Since the KNO scalingbased approach is designed to reproduce the dispersion data, GENIE can make the large multiplicities, such as n=6, n=8, etc, as data suggested. On the other hand, in the right plot, the GENIE hadronization model solely depends on PYTHIA. In this case, we see PYTHIA has problems reproducing large hadron multiplicity events. Therefore, the combination of KNO scaling-based model and PYTHIA cannot make smooth topological cross sections. This indicates the dispersion of hadron multiplicity reproduced by PYTHIA is smaller than the data.",

In inelastic interaction processes, both primary interactions and nuclear effects play significant roles and currently disagreements between data and predictions are not well understood [48].

However, the inclusion of a detector simulation in general smears structures and it will make the results of two different hadronization models nearly identical. This result can be understood from a simulated W distribution of PINGU. PINGU is dominated by few GeV low W interactions (< 5 GeV ) where PYTHIA hadronization processes have a minor role (Fig. 2).

All studies in the paper are qualitative in nature, and quantitative studies are beyond the scope of this paper. At the present moment, PYTHIA parameter tunings based on fits to neutrino experimental data are not being performed. An example of the difficulty of PYTHIA tunings is the correlations between different PYTHIA parameters, as HERMES collaborators noted [29]. In this article, we find that controlling the shape of the Lund string fragmentation function using the Lund a and Lund b parameters is the key to control the averaged hadron multiplicity, and a more precise tuning is left as a direction for future work. Near future LArTPC experiment, such as MicroBooNE, could test the hadronization models by measuring high hadron multiplicity events.",

Here, we used a simple formula to model the atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 neutrino spectrum[25,26], described later. As you can see, the W -distribution in this energy region can be split into three main interaction modes, quasi-elastic (red hatched, left peak), resonance (blue hatched, middle), and DIS (green hatched, right). The AGKY model is applied to DIS interactions. Also note DIS is extended to the low W region to describe nonresonance interactions in the resonance region. Although charm production processes are possible at the high energies, contributions are minor and throughout this article we ignore charm production processes.",

            "text": "Fig. 3is due to nuclear effects in deuterium[20,21,33,38]. Despite the conflict of data, the HERMES parameterization in general increases the averaged charged hadron multiplicity, which improves the agreement with averaged charged hadron multiplicity data from neutrino bubble chamber experiments.Fig. 4is the same plot for\u03bd \u00b5 \u2212 p interactions. Again, the agreement with the data is better for GENIE with the modified PYTHIA parameter set. Therefore, this new parameter set works better for both neutrino and antineutrino interactions.The main effect of this new parameterization originates from the increase of the Lund a parameter and the decrease of the Lund b parameter (Eq. 1). As shown inFig. 1, these changes make the fragmentation function softer. This enhances emissions of soft hadrons, i.e., this increases averaged charged hadron multiplicity and thus it agrees better with data. In the higher energy experiments that PYTHIA is designed for, high order QCD effects cause additional low energy parton emissions. This causes hadrons to be produced with a broader spectrum in z. Because these effects are negligible for the neutrino experiments we are concerned with, we shift the peak of the fragmentation function to a lower z value by increasing (decreasing) the Lund a (b) parameter[30].In fact, all parameterization schemes from HERMES we checked(Table 1) have a high (low) Lund a (b) parameter, and many have more extreme values than the ones we use here. However, these higher (lower) Lund a (b) parameter models tend to overestimate hadron multiplicities compared to neutrino hadron production data from bubble chamber experiments and as a result the data-MC agreement becomes worse. The neutrino hadronization data prefer a relatively smaller Lund a parameter than most HERMES parameter sets, yet bigger than the default PYTHIA choice, and this is the main reason why we chose this specific parameterization scheme in this paper.",
