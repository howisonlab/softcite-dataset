Traditionally, such methods assign each event exclusively to a single class producing classification errors in overlap regions of data space. As an alternative to this so called hard classification approach, we propose estimating posterior probabilities of each diffractive class and using these estimates to weigh event contributions to physical observables. It is shown with a Monte Carlo study that such a soft classification scheme is able to reproduce observables such as multiplicity distributions and relative event rates with a much higher accuracy than hard classification.",

            "text": "Diffraction is usually identified based on large rapidity gaps (LRG) although it is widely acknowledged that this requirement alone leads to insufficient separation between diffractive and non-diffractive events. This is due to long range correlations that may destroy the LRG. In fact, the gap survival probability S 2 of single diffractive events at LHC energies is only of the order of 10% [1]. Additionally, because of fluctuations in hadronization, also the non-diffractive background contains a non-negligible amount of LRG events [2]. Moreover, a rapidity gap may just be an experimental artifact due to high detection thresholds. Hence, in order to achieve more efficient identification of diffraction, alternatives to a simple cut on \u2206\u03b7 should be investigated.",

Such an approach does not explicitly look for rapidity gaps, but instead considers the full event topology in an optimal manner. That is, instead of heuristically determining the type of events to look for, such algorithms are able to learn the event characteristics providing the best discriminative power based on a suitably selected training set of labeled events.",

We call these hard classification algorithms, examples of which are neural networks and support vector machines. In our case, hard classification corresponds to classifying each event as either single diffractive, with the diffractive system on the left (SDL) or the right side (SDR), double diffractive (DD) or non-diffractive (ND) 1 . As there is inherent mixing between these classes, such an approach is bound to produce classification errors in the overlap regions of the data space. This is especially the case with DD events which often exhibit characteristics similar to SD and ND events. For this reason, instead of considering a single class only, we propose estimating the probabilities for each event to belong to each of the classes. We then use these probabilities to weigh the contribution of an event to physical observables. In the spirit of [4], we call such an approach soft classification.",

The sample contained SDL, SDR, DD and ND events in ratios determined by the MC tune. Starting from this generator level information, we calculated energy deposits and charged particle multiplicities registered by the IP5 detectors at the LHC based on their geometric acceptances. By dividing the CMS central tracker into 3 \u03b7 bins and T1 and T2 on both sides into 2 bins, multiplicity was recorded in 11 \u03b7 bins. The same amount of bins was also used for energy deposits corresponding to division of the central calorimeters into 3 bins, HF on both sides into 2 bins and a single bin each for CASTOR and the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) on both sides of the interaction point. In the case of the ZDC, only the energy of neutral particles was recorded. No thresholds or other detector effects were included in the simulations. By computing also the scalar sum of p T and the invariant mass of charged particles within |\u03b7| < 2.5, each event was represented by 24-dimensional data vector x x x. The MC sample was divided into training, validation and test sets each containing 50000 events followed by a normalization with the mapping x i \u2192 log(x i + 1). After further normalization for mean and variance, the dimensionality of the events was reduced to 3 using LDA. The optimal value of the parameter k for this data was found based on maximization of efficiency on the validation set. The kNN algorithm was then used to perform both soft and hard classification of the test set. As an additional benchmark, we also trained an MLP neural network [5] with 10 hidden nodes on a single hidden layer to perform hard classification of the same test set.",

Similar results were also obtained for the \u2211 p T distribution.

The results obtained using the soft kNN algorithm on a generator level MC sample show that the approach accurately reproduces physical observables. Soft classification could hence serve as an alternative to the rapidity gap method. The main drawback of the approach is its dependency on the selection of the training set which makes the classification MC dependent. The severity of this dependence is a subject of an ongoing study, the preliminary results of which suggest that soft classification is more robust against a misspecified training set than the hard methods. In some cases, it might also be possible to use data-driven methods for constructing the training set. The natural next step of the study is to employ detector level MC and eventually perform a full physics analysis using real data.",
