The analysis is based on events with energy deposits in the forward calorimeters, which cover pseudorapidities of \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22123.0 and +3.0 < \u03b7 < +5.2. An inelastic cross section of 68.6 \u00b1 0.5(syst) \u00b1 1.6(lumi) mb is obtained for events with M X > 4.1 GeV and/or M Y > 13 GeV, where M X and M Y are the masses of the diffractive dissociation systems at negative and positive pseudorapidities, respectively. The results are compared with those from other experiments as well as to predictions from high-energy hadron-hadron interaction models.",

The hadron-hadron cross section can be decomposed into elastic and inelastic contributions (including diffractive and nondiffractive topologies), each of which can be described by nonperturbative phenomenological models, based on general principles such as unitarity and analyticity [1]. These models have, however, large uncertainties when extrapolating existing data to higher center-of-mass energies [2][3][4], and need to be constrained by measurements.",

The value of the inelastic pp cross section, \u03c3 inel , is also used in the estimation of the number of simultaneous pp interactions occurring in the same beam-bunch crossing (henceforward referred to as \"pileup\") and is thus an important quantity to properly control the backgrounds in pp collision events measured at the LHC.

Several collaborations have extrapolated their measurements to the full inelastic phase space. The values reported for the total inelastic pp cross section at \u221a s = 7 TeV range from 66.9 \u00b1 5.3 to 73. 7 \u00b1 3.4 mb [13-19]. The TOTEM Collaboration, in particular, derived the inelastic cross section by exploiting the optical theorem, thereby avoiding model-dependent extrapolations for the low-mass diffraction contribution.

This value has been extrapolated to the total inelastic phase space, yielding \u03c3 inel = 78.1 \u00b1 0.6 (syst) \u00b1 1.3 (lumi) \u00b1 2.6 (extr) mb, with the last number being the extrapolation uncertainty. Finally, the TOTEM Collaboration obtained a value for the inelastic cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV of \u03c3 inel = 79.5 \u00b1 1.8 (syst) mb [22]. This paper presents a new measurement of the inelastic cross section in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Data collected with the CMS forward calorimeters HF and CASTOR, described in section 2 and covering pseudorapidities \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22123.0 and +3.0 < \u03b7 < +5.2, are analyzed. These detectors provide sensitivity to a large part of the total inelastic cross section, including diffractive events with dissociated protons that produce particles only at forward rapidity, with the exception of low-mass diffraction and events that happen to have rapidity gaps in the regions covered, including central exclusive production, e.g., diffractive dissociation mediated via double pomeron exchange. The fiducial cross section is therefore measured in a phase space region excluding fractional momentum losses of the scattered protons \u03be X = M 2 X /s < 10 \u22127 and \u03be Y = M 2 Y /s < 10 \u22126 , corresponding to M X < 4.1 GeV and M Y < 13 GeV, where M X and M Y are defined as the invariant masses of the dissociated proton systems with negative and positive pseudorapidities, respectively. The use of the CASTOR forward calorimeter allows the extension of this type of measurement to a low mass region so far unexplored.",

These triggers are 100% efficient for the event selection under consideration. A first sample of inelastic events is then selected offline by requiring an energy deposit above 5 GeV in either of the two HF calorimeters. This threshold was optimized by studying detector noise in events without beam. The rate of selected events from single bunches was found to be consistent with the one from empty bunches.

In eq. (4.1), the second term on the right-hand side is a first-order correction for genuine signal events (with occurrence approximated by F ZB \u2212 F EB ) overlaid with noise (with occurrence F EB ). Corrections of higher order in F EB are found to be negligible. Table 1 includes an overview of the noise-subtracted fraction of events (N cor /(N ZB F ZB )) found in the various runs. The number of events is further corrected for the effect of pileup. The observed number of pp collisions per bunch crossing, n, follows a Poisson distribution, P (n, \u03bb), with average value \u03bb. As the probability to find an interaction in a crossing with filled bunches is given by N cor /N ZB , the probability to have no interaction can be obtained as P (0, \u03bb) \u2261 exp(\u2212\u03bb) = 1 \u2212 N cor /N ZB , which allows \u03bb to be determined from the data.

Averaging the cross sections obtained from runs with the HF and CASTOR calorimeters in the extended phase space yields \u03c3(\u03be X > 10 \u22127 or \u03be Y > 10 \u22126 ) = 68.6 \u00b1 0.5 (syst) \u00b1 1.6 (lumi) mb, (7.2) also with a statistical uncertainty that is smaller than the least significant reported digit. Figure 1 shows the inelastic cross sections in the two phase space domains compared to the predictions of the various models used in this analysis. Table 3 shows the increase in the cross section from \u03be > 10 \u22126 to \u03be X > 10 \u22127 or \u03be Y > 10 \u22126 for the data and the various models. These models are used with their set of tunable parameters as described in section 3. Different models and tunes are used to investigate the sensitivity of the fiducial cross section to these parameters, and no uncertainties on individual model predictions are displayed. The variation between model predictions is mainly due to different descriptions of the diffractive contribution to the cross section. This can be concluded from the fact that models with the same approach to diffraction predict very similar cross sections (Epos LHC and QGSJetII-04, versus pythia 6 Z2* (SS) and pythia 8 CUETP8M1 (SS), respectively). The relative increase in the inelastic cross section observed in the data is three times larger than the experimental uncertainty. Most models describe reasonably well this small, but significant, relative increase in the inelastic cross section, but in general overpredict their value in both \u03be ranges. The pythia 8 Monash (DL) model describes data fairly well for \u03be > 10 \u22126 , but predicts a too steep increase for \u03be X > 10 \u22127 or \u03be Y > 10 \u22126 . Moreover, a comparison of the same models to fiducial and total inelastic cross section measurements at \u221a s = [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]21,22] indicates that, while the total inelastic cross section is reasonably well described, the cross section for diffractive dissociation events escaping detection, at masses even lower than those considered here, is substantially underestimated by the models, leading to an overestimation of the fiducial cross sections. One may therefore conclude that a model-based extrapolation of the fiducial cross section to the total inelastic phase space would yield a value that is too low for most models.",

In contrast, the same models generally describe reasonably well the measurements of the total inelastic cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV [21,22]. Given that the difference between the two sets of measurements is dominated by the contribution from low-mass diffractive processes, the data-model discrepancies observed here suggest a theoretical underestimation of the cross section for such events.
