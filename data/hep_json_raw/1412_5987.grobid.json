In this paper, we propose a technique that is based on the reconstruction of large angle positrons in the decay tunnel to identify three-body semileptonic K + \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 \u03bd e decays. This tagging facility operated in positron counting mode (\"event count mode\") can be employed to determine the absolute \u03bd e flux at the neutrino detector with O(1 %) precision. Facilities operated in \"event by event tag mode\" i.e. tagged neutrino beams that exploit the time coincidence of the positron at source and the \u03bd e interaction at the detector, are also discussed.",

            "text": "A detailed knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections plays a crucial role in the precision era of oscillation physics [1,2]. In the last decade, a vigorous experimental programme has been pursued, employing both the near detectors of running long-baseline experiments [3][4][5][6][7][8] and dedicated experiments [9][10][11] with special targets and PID capabilities. The large statistics accumulated so far and the careful strategy implemented for systematic mitigation have improved our knowledge of total and differential cross sections for \u03bd \u03bc and\u03bd \u03bc in the range of interest (0.3-5 GeV) for future long-baseline and sterile neutrino experiments [12]. All these experiments are, however, designed to work in \u03bd e appearance mode and the direct measurement of \u03bd e interactions still relies on scarce data [13,14]. Calculations are thus based on extrapolation from \u03bd \u03bc results. Despite lepton universality of weak interactions, the ratio between \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd e suffers from uncertainties due to nuclear effects [15] that have to be constrained with data to reduce systematic errors a e-mail: francesco.terranova@cern.ch in future long baseline \u03bd e appearance experiments [16,17]. To cope with this challenge, novel experimental approaches have been proposed with the aim of producing pure, intense and well controlled sources of electron neutrinos [18][19][20][21][22]. The technique proposed in the following has a similar aim: electron neutrinos are produced by the three body decay of K + (K e3 , i.e. K + \u2192 e + \u03bd e \u03c0 0 ) in standard neutrino beams. The positrons are identified in the decay tunnel by purely calorimetric techniques and the beam-line is optimized to enhance the \u03bd e components from K e3 and suppress to a negligible level the \u03bd e contamination from muon decays. This approach -from here on called \"event count mode\" -has several advantages. It provides a source of electron neutrinos that can be used to study \u03bd e interactions in a direct manner, i.e. without relying on extrapolations from \u03bd \u03bc . In addition, it delivers an observable (the positron rate) that can be directly linked to the rate of \u03bd e at the far detector through the three body kinematics of K e3 . The positron rate in the decay tunnel thus determines the flux with a precision significantly better than what is currently achieved with conventional untagged \u03bd \u03bc beams (\u223c10 %). Finally, this facility paves the way for the realization of tagged neutrino beams [23][24][25][26][27] in the configuration proposed in Ref. [28], where the positron is associated to the corresponding \u03bd e interaction at the far detector on an event by event basis (\"event by event tag mode\"). In this mode, full kinematic reconstruction of the K e3 can be achieved measuring the photon pair from \u03c0 0 decay, thus retrieving information on the energy of \u03bd e for each tagged event.",

In general, high energy neutrino beams as the CNGS [31] are contaminated by \u03bd e originating from the K e3 decays of K + while the contamination of lower energy neutrino beams is mostly due to \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 e + \u03bd e\u03bd\u03bc \u03bd \u03bc .

BR(K e3 ) is the K e3 branching ratio: 5.07 \u00b1 0.04 % [32]. L is the length of the decay tunnel. \u03c4 K (\u03c4 \u03c0 ) and \u03b3 K (\u03b3 \u03c0 ) are the lifetime and Lorentz factor of the K + (\u03c0 + ), respectively. The scaling of Eq. 1 is depicted in Fig. 1 assuming R K /\u03c0 = 10 % (see Table 1 below). For a beam dominated by the K e3 contamination, the only source of primary positrons in the decay tunnel is the K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd e decay and the Dalitz from the \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decay (BR 1.2 %). All other positrons are either due to DIF of muons (from pions or beam halo) or to photon conversions in the material around the decay tunnel. Two body positron decays (\u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd e and K + \u2192 e + \u03bd e ) are chirality-suppressed and can be neglected. As a consequence, all primary positrons are originated by three-body decays and are distributed at angles much larger than the angles of the muons from two-body \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc decays. For the beam parameters considered in Sect. 3, the mean positron angle (88 mrad) is 22 times larger than the corresponding mean \u03bc + angle and \u223c 30 times larger than the beam divergence of the undecayed particles. These considerations [28] support the instrumentation of the decay tunnel with detectors having a geometry similar to the calorimeters of hadron colliders (hollow cylinders). As discussed in Sect. 4, the technology requirements (radiation hardness, fast readout, fast recovery time for pile-up mitigation etc.) are quite similar, too. Since neither the muons from \u03c0 + decay nor the bulk of undecayed particles cross the calorimeter before reaching the beam dump, the particle rate is much smaller than the rate of muon monitors in conventional neutrino beams; such rate (see below) can be handled by standard detector and readout technologies developed for the hadron colliders. Finally, the need for short decay tunnels reduces the size of the calorimeter and makes the instrumentation of the whole tunnel -which was considered far-fetched in 1979 [24] -a viable option.",

The optimal value for the mean secondary momentum is around 8.5 GeV. Lower values decrease the \u03c0 + /e + separation efficiencies, while higher values reduce the flux and bring the \u03bd e spectrum above the region of interest for future long-baseline experiments (0.5-4 GeV).",

The decay tunnel consists of an evacuated beampipe (40 cm radius) surrounded by the positron detectors (see Sect. 4). For the calculation of the neutrino flux, we simulated pions and kaons distributed uniformly in a 10 \u00d7 10 cm 2 window in the transverse plane and with a flat polar angle distribution (up to 3 mrad). In fact, the actual meson beam distribution at the entrance of the decay tunnel is not a critical parameter because the neutrino beam divergence at this energy is dominated by the large neutrino decay angle with respect to the parent meson. The meson beam emittance has only to be small enough to contain the secondary beam inside the tagging detector. An unfocused meson beam entering the decay tunnel within a window of \u00b15 cm in both transverse projections and with a polar angle smaller than 3 mrad, is fully contained in a 50 m long, 40 cm radius decay tunnel, even including the tertiary muons produced in \u03c0 + decays (see Sect. 4). This phase space area corresponds to a geometrical acceptance of the decay tunnel A = 4\u00d7(5 cm)\u00d7(3 mrad) = 4 x x = 4 yy = 0.60 mm rad, where x x = yy = 0.15 mm rad in both transverse projections.

The capture of secondaries at the target in a facility operated in event count mode can thus be implemented with conventional magnetic horns. On the other hand, fast extractions (10 \u00b5s) challenge the positron tagger, whose local rate must be kept at the level of O(1) MHz/cm 2 . The optimal choice for the event count mode is \u223c2 ms. Such extraction length has already been employed at the CERN West Area Neutrino Facility (WANF [33]). It is also the parameter on which the NUMI horns and their power supplies have been originally designed [34]. Actually, in spite of the fact that both NOVA and T2K implement a fast extraction (10 \u00b5s) scheme [35], the typical current pulse width used to source their horns is \u223c2 ms. Longer extractions introduce additional constraints on the horn, due to the increase of Joule heating. In particular, thicker conductors will be needed to reduce resistive heating which, in turn, can cause beam deterioration due to particle re-interactions [34]. In addition, long extractions may reduce the \u03bd e CC purity due to cosmic background at shallow depth (see Sect. 6).",

The inner radius corresponds to a line of sight between the entrance of the tunnel and the beam dump of 8 mrad. All undecayed particles (\u03c0 + , K + , p) and all muons from the 2-body decay of \u03c0 + will reach the dump without crossing the calorimeter. The overall rate at the calorimeter will therefore be dominated by kaon decays. Since the decay  Figure 4 (black dashed line) also shows the energy distribution of background \u03c0 + from 2-body decay of K + (see Sect. 5). Positrons in the decay tunnel are identified by calorimetric techniques, exploiting the longitudinal shower development for particle identification. Photon rejection is achieved by a \"t 0 layer\", a pre-shower that provides the absolute time of arrival of the charged particle and is used to veto neutral particles in the calorimeter. Figure 6 shows the number of particles (expressed in Hz/cm 2 ) entering the calorimeter as a function of the position z along the tunnel. Each bin corresponds to a surface of 2\u03c0 R in z = 1.26 m 2 . For a 2 ms extraction length and 10 10 \u03c0 + per spill, the maximum positron rate (upper plot -red dashed line) is 10 kHz/cm 2 . The overall rate (upper plotblack continuous line) is dominated by muons originating by two-body decays of kaons (K \u03bc2 \u2261 K + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc , whose BR is 63.55 \u00b1 0.11 %; see lower plot -black continuous line) and photons (lower plot -green dotted line). The peak rate is 500 kHz/cm 2 (5 MHz per channel for a calorimeter with a granularity of 10 cm 2 ). Due to the 3 mrad beam divergence and the Lorentz boost of decayed particles, rates are low in the first 10 m of the tunnel and they saturate at nearly constant value for z > 10 m. During a single 2 ms spill, we expect 10 10 \u03c0 + and 1.02 \u00d7 10 9 K + at the entrance of the tunnel (the K + /\u03c0 + ratio is 10.2 % for 120 GeV protons -see Table 1).

Hence, the actual outer radius of the calorimeter will be larger than R out (by \u223c30 % for 1.5 cm Cu slabs interleaved by 0.5 cm scintillator tiles). The simulated energy deposition is sampled at the first 5X 0 (E 1 ) and 10X 0 (E 2 ) and the variables R 1 \u2261 E 1 /E tot and R 2 \u2261 E 2 /E tot are used for pion/positron separation. Since uncertainties on E 1 and E 2 are completely dominated by fluctuations due to lateral leakage, E 1 (E 2 ) is defined as  the energy deposited in the first 5 (10) radiation lengths inside a cylinder of radius 2R M without additional smearing. R M = 1.568 cm is the Moliere radius of copper. The material of the t 0 layer and beam pipe is neglected: the impact of the beam pipe material on the background from photon conversion is discussed in Sect. 5. A positron is defined as an energy deposit in the calorimeter associated with a hit in the t 0 layer. The energy deposited E tot must be greater than 300 MeV. We also request the energy deposit in the first 5 and 10 X 0 to be significantly larger than for a minimum ionizing particle (MIP): R 1 > 0.2, R 2 > 0.7. These requirements select positrons from K e3 with 69 % efficiency. Table 3 summarizes the overall efficiency (59 %) including the geometrical acceptance of the tagging calorimeter due to positrons escaping at low polar angles into the beam dump. Since local rates result only from kaons and are quite low compared with collider requirements, several technologies are available both for the calorimeter and for the t 0 layer. As a reference, we considered a scintillator tile calorimeter readout by SiPM and WLS fibers similar to the CALICE AHCAL [44] but with much coarser longitudinal segmentation. Other options, developed both for LHC and for CLIC are possible, too [45]. Unlike applications at colliders, pile-up mitigation and integrated doses are not particularly critical. For a R = 0.5 MHz/cm 2 local rate and a tile size S 10 cm 2 , the pile up probability is P = R S T cal (4) T cal being the recovery time of the calorimeter. It corresponds to P = 0.05 for T cal = 10 ns. In fact, pile-up mostly results from the overlap of a muon from K \u03bc2 with a candidate positron. Further pile-up mitigation is possible since MIP-like deposits and punch-through particles can be vetoed or removed offline using the longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeter and, if needed, a muon catcher layer (Fe + muon chambers) located at R > R out .",

The misidentification rate is below 10 \u22123 when integrated to all muons produced by K \u03bc2 , K \u03bc3 and the DIF of pions from the other decay modes. As a consequence, background from muon misidentification does not represent a limitation for PID in the instrumented decay tunnel.",
