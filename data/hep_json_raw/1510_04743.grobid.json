            "text": "Low energy muon physics experiments frequently use copious beams of \" surface muons\", i.e. muons generated by pions decaying at rest close to the surface of the pion production target, such as those produced at meson factories (PSI and TRIUMF). In the Standard Model (SM) with massless neutrinos, positive (negative) muons are fully polarized, with the spin opposite (parallel) to the muon momentum vector, that is P \u03bc = \u22121 for positive muons, at the production point; the muon polarization can be partially reduced by the muon interaction with the electric and magnetic fields of the muon beam line as well as with the muon stopping target. The degree of polarization at the muon decay point affects both the energy and angular distribution of the muon decay products i.e. Michel positrons and \u03b3 s from the normal \u03bc + \u2192 e + \u03bd\u03bd and radiative muon decay \u03bc + \u2192 e +\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd e \u03b3 . The muon decay products are an important background when searching for rare decays such as \u03bc + \u2192 e + \u03b3 ; a precise knowledge of their distribution is therefore mandatory. We report on the determination of the residual muon polarization in the PSI \u03c0 E5 [1] channel and MEG beam line [2] from the data collected by the MEG experiment between 2009 and 2011. Clear signs of the muon polarization are visible in the Michel positron angular distribution; the measured polarization is in good agreement with a theoretical calculation (see Sect. 2) based on the SM predictions and on the beam line characteristics.",

Preliminary results were published in [4,5] and [6]. The analysis of the MEG full data sample is under way and will soon be published. A detailed description of the experiment can be found in [2]. A high intensity surface muon beam (\u223c3 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b5 + /s), from the \u03c0 E5 channel and MEG beam line, is brought to rest in a 205 \u00b5m slanted plastic target, placed at the centre of the experimental set-up. The muon decay products are detected by a spectrometer with a gradient magnetic field and by an electromagnetic calorimeter. The magnetic field is generated by a multi-coil superconducting magnet (COBRA) [7,8], with conventional compensation coils; the maximum intensity of the field is 1.26 T at the target position. The positron momenta are measured by sixteen drift chambers (DCH) [9], radially aligned, and their arrival times by means of a Timing Counter (TC) [10][11][12], consisting of two scintillator arrays, placed at opposite sides relative to the muon target. The momentum vector and the arrival time of photons are measured in a 900 liter C-shaped liquid xenon photon detector (LXe) [13,14], equipped with a dense array of 846 UV-sensitive PMTs. A dedicated trigger system [15,16] allows an efficient preselection of possible \u03bc + \u2192 e + \u03b3 candidates, with an almost zero dead-time. The signals coming from the DCH, TC and LXe detectors are processed by a custom-made waveform digitizer system (DRS4) [17,18] operating at a maximum sampling speed close to 2 GHz. Several calibration tools are in operation, allowing a continuous monitoring of the experiment [19][20][21]. Dedicated prescaled trigger schemes collect calibration events for a limited amount of time (few hours/week). A complete list of the experimental resolutions (\u03c3 's) for energies close to the kinematic limit m \u03bc /2 can be found in [6]; the most relevant being: \u223c340 keV/c for the positron momentum, \u223c10 mrad for the positron zenith angle and \u223c 1 and \u223c 3 mm for the positron vertex along the two axes orthogonal to the beam direction.",

The latter involved the fitting of a constant cloud muon content to the limited region of the measured muon momentum spectrum, around the kinematic edge at \u224829.79 MeV/c. This was cross-checked by direct measurements of negative cloud muons at the MEG central beam momentum of 28 MeV/c, where there is no surface muon contribution on account of the charge sign (muonic atom formation of stopped negative muons). The cloud muon content was found to be consistent from both measurements when taking the kinematics and cross-sections of positive and negative pions into account.

In the MEG beam line the first term is associated with the guiding elements (quadrupole and bending magnets), while the second term is associated with the electrostatic separator. The geometrical parameters of the beam elements and their field intensities are [1]: for the deflecting magnets the length is \u224870 cm and the vertical field is \u22480.15 T; for the electrostatic separator the length is 82 cm, the gap between the plates 19 cm and the applied voltage \u2212195 kV. The COBRA spectrometer has a weak spatially varying magnetic field, which muons are subjected to while travelling on the US-side of the magnet, after being focused by the beam transport solenoid; the average vertical component of the COBRA magnetic field around the muon trajectory is of order of 0.025 T and its contribution to the spin rotation is about one order of magnitude smaller than the one of the bending magnets. With these parameters we evaluated a spin rotation of \u22480.25 \u2022 due to the magnetic component and of \u22487 \u2022 due to the electrostatic component. Note that the longitudinal polarization is, by definition, referred to the muon velocity, while the polarization we are interested in is the one in the beam direction, our natural quantization axis.

The behaviour of positive muons in matter is extensively discussed in the literature (for a review [25]). After a rapid moderation and thermalization of muons in matter, muonium (\u03bc + e \u2212 ) is formed and further thermalized by collisions. The muon polarization is unaffected during the muonium formation and thermalization and subsequent decay. Muonium interaction with the magnetic field in vacuum is described by a hyperfine Hamiltonian, which includes the muon-electron spin-spin interaction and the Larmor interaction of both spins with the external field. On the basis defined by the total spin S and by its projection along the quantization axis S Z , the muonium wavefunction is a superposition of a triplet state (S = 1) and of a singlet state (S = 0). If one assumes muons to be fully polarized in the longitudinal direction when they enter the target and electrons in the target to be unpolarized, the initial state of the muonium formation is a 50-50 % mixture of the state (S = 1, S Z = \u22121) and the combination of (S = 1, S Z = 0) and (S = 0, S Z = 0). The coefficients of this combination and their time evolution can be calculated as functions of the ratio x = B/B 0 , where B is the external magnetic field and B 0 = 0.1585 T.

The fraction of the positrons decaying off-target and reconstructed on the target was evaluated by a complete MC simulation of the muon trajectory along the PSI/MEG beam line up to the stopping target and of the subsequent muon decay. This fraction was found to be smaller than 0.5 % and can be considered as a source of systematic uncertainty assuming, very conservatively, the same effect on the polarization measurement.

Michel positrons were generated in the stopping target (the full simulation of the muon beam up to the stopping target described above was not used since it is much slower and does not bring significant advantages in this case) with a minimum energy of 40 MeV and a muon polarization P \u03bc varying between 0 and \u22121 in steps of 0.1. A smaller step size of 0.05 was used between \u22120.8 and \u22121, close to the expected value (Sect. 2). Separate samples of MC events were produced for each polarization value and the positron energy and direction were generated according to the theoretical energy-angle distribution corresponding to this polarization. Positrons were individually followed within the fiducial volume and their hits in the tracking system and on the timing counters were recorded; a simulation of the electronic chain converted these hits into anodic and cathodic signals which were processed by the same analysis algorithms used for real data. Modifications of the apparatus configuration during the whole period of data taking were simulated in detail, following the information recorded for each run in the experiment database. The position and spatial orientation of the target varied slightly each year, as well as trigger and acquisition thresholds, beam spot centre and size and the drift chamber alignment calibration constants. Some of the drift chambers suffered from instabilities, with a time scale from days to weeks, with their supply voltages finally set to a value smaller than nominal. The supply voltage variations, chamber by chamber, were also followed in the simulation on a run by run basis. However, voltage instabilities do not significantly affect the polarization measurement. Since drift chamber wires run along the z-axis, a non operating chamber produces the same effect on US and DS if the beam is perfectly centred on the target, while it gives a second order contribution to the US-DS asymmetry when the beam is not perfectly centred. The number of MC events generated using the global configuration (target position, alignment ...) corresponding to a given year is proportional to the actual amount of data collected in that year.",

The slope of this dependence is P \u03bc cos \u03b8 : one can therefore extract a polarization value by fitting the experimentally measured asymmetry and ratio and dividing the measured slope by the average value of |cos \u03b8 | = 0.1762 for the US and DS sections.

            "text": "1. Energy scale. The energy scale and resolution are determined in MEG, as discussed in [5], by fitting the Michel positron energy spectrum with the convolution of the theoretical spectrum (including radiative corrections) of the detector acceptance and of a resolution curve, in the form of a partially constrained triple Gaussian shape. The position of the Michel edge, used as a reference calibration point, is determined with a precision of \u03b4 E e + \u223c 30 keV. The effect of this uncertainty was evaluated by varying the reconstructed energy of our events by a factor 1 \u00b1 \u03b4 E e + /\u0112 e + , where\u0112 e + = 52.83 MeV is the position of the Michel edge, and repeating the analysis. The polarization value determined by the average of A (E e + ) and R (E e + ) fits increases by 0.0029 when \u03b4 E e + /\u0112 e + is added and decreases by \u22120.0052 when \u03b4 E e + /\u0112 e + is subtracted. 2. Angular bias. The angular resolution is determined by looking at tracks crossing the chamber system twice (double turn method), as discussed in [4,5]. The uncertainty on the \u03b8 and \u03c6 scales varies between 1 and 3 mrad. The effect of this uncertainty on the angular scale was (conservatively) evaluated by modifying both the reconstructed polar angles by \u00b13 mrad and repeating the analysis. The measured polarization decreases (increases) by \u22120.013 (+0.025). 3. Target position. The target position with respect to the centre of the COBRA magnet is measured by means of an optical survey and checked by looking at the distribution of the positron vertex of reconstructed tracks. The discrepancies between the two methods are at the level of a fraction of a mm. Since in our analysis we require that the reconstructed positron vertex lies within the target ellipse, an error on the target position can alter the positron selection. We assumed a conservative estimate of a target position uncertainty of \u00b11 mm on all coordinates and, as previously, added or subtracted it and repeated the analysis. The effect was to decrease (increase) the polarization by \u22120.022 (0.016). 4. MC-based corrections. The MC corrections, inserted to take into account the absolute tracking efficiency, are based on the position of the target as measured by the optical survey and on the nominal location of the beam centre. A variation of these parameters produces a variation on the correction functions, applied year by year to MC and data. We estimated the size of this effect by generating MC samples with a displaced beam and target (\u00b11 mm shift as previously) and null polarization and determined new tracking efficiency correction functions. Such func-tions were then applied to the data and MC: the measured polarization decreased (increased) by \u22120.035 (0.036). 5. Threshold effects. The response of the MEG tracking system close to the momentum threshold (E e + \u2248 45 MeV) depends in general on the polar angles and can be significantly distorted when the beam and target are not centred, causing fictitious differences between the US and DS sides. In 2010 the beam centre to target centre displacement was maximal, corresponding to more than 3 mm in the horizontal plane and just over 3 mm in the vertical plane, producing an asymmetric US-DS energy threshold, with the DS spectrum systematically higher than the US one for E e + < 47 MeV. The beam and target displacement were introduced in the MC, but the simulation for 2010 did not result in a good agreement with the data in the region close to the energy threshold. We then estimated the systematic effect due to the angular dependence of the energy threshold by removing the 2010 sample from the fit: the polarization decreases by \u22120.047, a difference twice larger than the statistical error. The \u03c7 2 /d.o. f. of the fit improved a bit from 0.74 to 0.71. A better fit quality was observed also on MC events by removing the simulated data corresponding to the year 2010 configuration. 6. Higher order corrections to the theoretical formula in Eq. 6. The effect of second and higher order contributions and of taking into account the finite electron mass to the muon decay rate is discussed in some detail in [33][34][35][36]. The conclusion is that they are smaller than the first order correction and therefore we can deduce that the effect of including them in Eq. 6 for extracting the polarization from Fig. 8 is not larger than the effect of the first order correction that is 0.3 %. Hence this value can be assumed as a conservative estimation of the systematic error due to higher order corrections. 7. Off-target muon decays. A conservative estimation of offtarget muon decays as discussed in Sect. 4.2 is 0.5 %, that is 0.004 on the polarization value.",
