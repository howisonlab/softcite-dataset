These results were rapidly confirmed by CDF [4]. The techniques utilized in those analyses and more recent, much higher statistics LHCb analyses [5][6][7] do not directly measure the normalized mass and the width differences of the neutral D eigenstates, x and y. In contrast, a time-dependent amplitude analysis of the Dalitz-plot (DP) of neutral D mesons decaying into selfconjugate final states provides direct measurements of both these parameters. This technique was introduced using D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays by the CLEO collaboration [8], and the first measurement by the Belle Collaboration [9] provided stringent constraints on the mixing parameters. More recent measurements with this final state by the BABAR and Belle collaborations [10,11] contribute significantly to the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) global fits that determine world average mixing and CP violation parameter values [12].",

The inclusion of charge conjugate reactions is implied throughout this paper. No measurement of CP violation is attempted as the data set lacks sufficient sensitivity to be interesting. The D 0 candidates are selected from D * (2010) + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + s decays where the D 0 flavor at production is identified by the charge of the slow pion, \u03c0 + s . The D 0 and D 0 meson flavor eigenstates evolve and decay as mixtures of the weak Hamiltonian eigenstates D 1 and D 2 with masses and widths m 1 , \u0393 1 and m 2 , \u0393 2 , respectively. The mass eigenstates can be expressed as superpositions of the flavor eigenstates, |D 1,2 = p D 0 \u00b1 q D 0 where the complex coefficients p and q satisfy |p| 2 +|q| 2 = 1.

The amplitudes are functions of position in the DP and are defined in our description of the fitting model in Sec. IV A Eq. (3). In Eq. (1), the first term is the direct decay rate to the final state f and is always the dominant term for sufficiently small decay times. The second term corresponds to mixing. Initially, the cosh(y\u0393 D t) and cos(x\u0393 D t) contributions to this term cancel, but over time the cosh(y\u0393 D t) contribution can become dominant. The third term is the interference term. It depends explicitly on the real and imaginary parts of A * f A f and on the real and imaginary parts of q/p. As for the mixing rate, the interference rate is intially zero, but it can become important at later decay times. The variation of the total decay rate from purely exponential depends on the relative strengths of the direct and mixing amplitudes, their relative phases, the mixing parameters x and y, and on the magnitude and phase of q/p. HFAG reports the world averages to be x = (0.49 +0.14 \u22120.15 )% and y = (0.61 \u00b1 0.08)% assuming no CP violation [12].",

Our model uses relativistic Breit-Wigner functions each multiplied by a real spindependent angular factor using the same formalism with the Zemach variation as described in Ref.

[23], W k also includes the Blatt-Weisskopf form factors with the radii of D 0 and intermediate resonances set at 5 GeV \u22121 and 1.5 GeV \u22121 , respectively. The CLEO collaboration modeled the decay as a coherent combination of four amplitudes: those with intermediate \u03c1 + , \u03c1 0 , \u03c1 \u2212 resonances and a uniform non-resonant term [24]. This form works well to describe lower statistics samples. In  this analysis we use the model we developed for our higher statistics search for time-integrated CP violation [18], which also includes other resonances as listed in Table I. The partial wave with a \u03c1 + resonance is the reference amplitude. The true decay time distribution at any point in the DP depends on the amplitude model and the mixing parameters. We model the observed decay time distribution at each point in the DP as an exponential with average decay time coming from the mixing formalism (Eq. (1)) convolved with the decay time resolution, modeled as the sum of three Gaussians with widths proportional to \u03c3 t and determined from simulation.

Efficiency variations across the Dalitz-plot are modeled by a histogram obtained from simulated decays generated with a uniformly populated phase space.

Our amplitude parameters and the associated fractions are generally consistent with the previous BABAR results based on a subset of our data [18]. The normalized difference between the signal DP and the model is shown in Fig. 2(b). The m 2 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 ) and m 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) projections of the data and model are shown in Fig. 2(c)-(e). Differences between the data and the fit model are apparent in both the Dalitz-plot itself and the projections. Large pull values are observed predominantly near low and high values of m 2 in all projections. However, we understand the origin of these discrepancies, and the systematic uncertainties induced on the mixing parameters are small, as discussed below. Our fit reports the raw mixing parameters as x = (2.08 \u00b1 1.17)% and y = (0.14 \u00b1 0.89)%. The correlation coefficient between x and y is \u22120.6%. The measured D 0 lifetime is \u03c4 D = (410.2 \u00b1 3.8) fs, and agrees with the world average of (410.1 \u00b1 1.5) fs [13]. The central values of x and y are later corrected by the estimated fit biases as discussed in Sec. V.",

The DP distribution of the signal is modeled as a coherent sum of quasi-two-body decays, involving several resonances. To study the sensitivity to the choice of the model, we remove some resonances from the coherent sum. To decide if removing a resonance provides a \"reasonable\" description of the data, we calculate the \u03c7 2 of a fit using an adaptive binning process where each bin contains at least a reasonable number of events so that its statistical uncertainty is well determined. With 1762 bins, the nominal fit has \u03c7 2 = 2794.

We take the largest variations as the systematic uncertainties. The other partial waves individually when removed produce \u2206\u03c7 2 > 165.

We ignore the migration of events which are produced at one point in the DP and reconstructed at another point; we parameterize detection efficiency from simulated events, generated with a uniformly populated DP using the observed positions, in the numerator. As noted earlier, this leads to discrepancies between fit projections and data for simulated data which are very similar to those observed for real data as observed in Fig. 2. We believe this is due to ignoring the systematic migration of events away from the boundaries of phase space induced by misreconstruction followed by constrained fitting. We have further checked the migration effect by fitting the data in a smaller DP phase space with all the boundaries shifted 0.05 GeV 2 inwards. In addition, detector resolution leads to a correlation between reconstructed D 0 mass and t, also noted earlier. To estimate the level of bias and systematic uncertainty introduced by these factors, we studied the full MC samples described in Section III. The fit results display small biases in x and y. From the fit to each sample, we determine the pull values for x and y, defined as the differences of fitted and input values.

We find x = (1.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 0.6)% and y = (0.2 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 0.5)%, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty can be reduced in analyses with larger data sets. Major sources of systematic uncertainty in this measurement include those originating in how we determine shifts for detector misalignment and the choice of decay time window. We estimated conservatively the former as it is already small compared to the statistical uncertainty of this measurement. The latter can be reduced by more carefully determining the signal-to-background ratio as a function of decay time. However, since the systematic uncertainties are already small compared to the statistical uncertainties, we choose not to do so in this analysis. Similar considerations suggest that systematic uncertainties will remain smaller than statistical uncertainties even when data sets grow to be 10 to 100 times larger in experiments such as LHCb and Belle II.",
