The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) that are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with resistive plate counter muon identifier modules interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% of the 4\u03c0 solid angle, and the charged-particle momentum resolution is 0.5% for transverse momenta of 1 GeV/c.

The measured Born cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 at each energy point is listed in Table 1. The measured cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 is much larger than that of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp at the same energy [39]. The difference in the detection efficiency between signal MC samples with and without the extra smearing is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty due to the kinematic fit is estimated by correcting the helix parameters of charged tracks for the signal MC sample according the method described in Ref. [40]. The difference in the detection efficiency between the MC samples with and without this correction is taken as the systematic uncertainty.  [41]. In the PWA fit, the resonance parameters are fixed according to the previous measurements [42,43]. Alternative fits are performed in which the resonance parameters are set as free parameters and the changes in the results are taken as systematic uncertainties. Uncertainties from additional resonances are estimated by adding the most significant additional resonance among each J P assignment in Ref. [36] into the PWA solution individually, and their influences on the cross section measurements are taken as the systematic uncertainties. Correlated systematic uncertainties among the different energy points include those from luminosity measurement (1.0%) [44], MDC tracking (2% for two charged tracks) [45], particle identification (2% in total for proton and antiproton) [46], photon detection efficiency (2%) [47] and radiative correction. The difference in (1 + \u03b4 r ) between the third and fourth iteration is taken as the systematic uncertainty due to the radiative correction, as the radiative-correction-dependent quantity (1 + \u03b4 r ) converges after three iterations.",

(2), \u03c3 con and \u03c3 Y represent the continuum cross section and resonant cross section, respectively, and \u03c3 con can be described by a function of s, \u03c3 con = C /s \u03bb , where the exponent \u03bb is a priori unknown. The parameter \u03c6 describes the phase between resonant and continuum production amplitudes. The mass m and width of the Y (4260) are fixed to the PDG values [28]. The values of C , \u03bb, \u03c3 Y , and the interference phase \u03c6 are free in the fit. The uncorrelated systematic uncertainties in the Born cross section measurements are directly considered in the fit and the effect of the correlated systematic uncertainties on the final results is estimated by the method in Ref. [48], in which the error propagation is determined from shifting the data by the aforementioned correlated uncertainties and adding the deviations in quadrature. In addition, the uncertainties for the beam energy measurements of all the data points taken from Ref. [49] are considered in the fit. The best fit function is shown in Fig. 2  G(\u03c3 Y , \u03c3 \u03c3 Y )dx/ \u221e 0 G(\u03c3 Y , \u03c3 \u03c3 Y )dx = 0.9, where G(\u03c3 Y , \u03c3 \u03c3 Y ) is a Gaussian function with mean value \u03c3 Y = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 pb and standard deviation \u03c3 \u03c3 Y = 5.9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 pb. The uncertainties from mass and width of the Y (4260) are considered by varying them by one standard deviation according to the PDG values [28] and the most conservative \u03c3 up Y is taken as the final result. The obtained upper limit is 0.01 pb. Compared to the measured cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8 [50,51], the upper limit on the ratio of the branching fractions B(Y (4260)\u2192pp\u03c0 0 ) B(Y (4260)\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8) at the 90% C.L. is determined to be 0.02%.

The optimal value of \u03c3 Y is (1.6 \u00b1 5.9) \u00d7 10 \u22123 pb with a statistical significance of 0.5\u03c3 . The significance is calculated based on the changes in the \u03c7 2 value and the number of free parameters in the fit with and without the assumption of existence of the Y (4260) resonance. The result for the phase between resonant and continuum production amplitudes is \u03c6 = 3.4 \u00b1 1.0. The parameters describing the slope of the continuum cross section are C = (5.4 \u00b1 5.3) \u2022 10 5 GeV 2\u03bb pb and \u03bb = 4.2 \u00b1 0.4.
