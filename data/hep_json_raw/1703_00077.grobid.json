Since then, measurements of the masses and widths of the charmonium family and their hadronic and radiative transition branching fractions have become more precise. The spectrum of bound charmonium states is important for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the perturbative and non-perturbative regions [2].",

The geant4-based [20] simulation software, BESIII Object Oriented Simulation [21], contains the detector geometry and material description, the detector response and signal digitization models, as well as records of the detector running conditions and performance. Effects of initial state radiation (ISR) are taken into account with the MC event generator kkmc [22,23], and final state radiation (FSR) effects are included in the simulation by using PHOTOS [24]. Particle decays are simulated with evtgen [25] for the known decay modes with branching fractions set to the world average [7] and with the lundcharm model [26] for the remaining unknown decays. Angular distributions of the cascade E1 transitions \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ follow the formulas in Refs. [27,28], while the cos \u03b8 distributions for \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 are generated according to phase space distributions. The \u03c7 cJ are simulated with Breit-Wigner line shapes. To account for the E1 transitions for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8, MC events will be weighted as described in Section IV.",

First, the event must satisfy the inclusive \u03c8(3686) selection requirements, as described in Section III A, and not be a non-\u03c8(3686) background event, as defined in Section III B, a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 event, or a \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 event. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 events are selected with the following requirements. There are two oppositely charged pions with momenta p \u03c0 < 0.45 GeV/c, and the mass recoiling from the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system, RM +\u2212 , must satisfy 3.09 < RM +\u2212 < 3.11 GeV/c 2 . The \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 events must have two \u03c0 0 s with p \u03c0 < 0.45 GeV/c, and the mass recoiling from the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system, RM 00 , must satisfy 3.085 < RM 00 < 3.12 GeV/c 2 . The photon must be in the EMC barrel. This requirement is used because the energy resolution is better for barrel photons, and there are fewer noise photons. The photon must satisfy the requirement of \u03b4 < 14 degrees (see Section III C) and not be part of a \u03c0 0 candidate. In Fig. 4  shown for data and inclusive MC events, respectively. The peaks from left to right in each distribution correspond to \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 , \u03b3\u03c7 c1 , \u03b3\u03c7 c0 , \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8, and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8. The very small peak at around 0.65 GeV is from the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c transition. Other small peaks not seen in the spectra but considered in the fit are J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c and \u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8. The inclusive \u03c8(3686) MC sample is used to obtain the signal shapes for charmonium transitions and the shape of the major component of the background under the signal peaks. The signal shape for each transition is obtained by matching the radiative photon at the generator level with one of the photons reconstructed in the EMC. The requirement, which has an efficiency greater than 99 %, is that the angle between the radiative photon and the reconstructed photon in the EMC must be less than 0.08 radians. No requirement on the energy is used to allow obtaining the tails of the energy distribution. The signal shapes are shown in Fig. 5. The three large peaks from left to right in Fig. 5 (a) correspond to the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 , \u03b3\u03c7 c1 , and \u03b3\u03c7 c0 transitions. The very small peak around 0.65 GeV is the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c transition. The peaks in Fig. 5 (b) from left to right correspond to the \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 transitions for J = 0, 1, and 2, where the \u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 peak at around 0.3 GeV is very small.",
