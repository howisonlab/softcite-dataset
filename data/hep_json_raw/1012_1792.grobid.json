Events are selected in two different topologies: single lepton (electron e or muon \u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least four jets, and dilepton (ee, \u03bc\u03bc or e\u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. In a data sample of 2.9 pb \u22121 , 37 candidate events are observed in the single-lepton topology and 9 events in the dilepton topology. The corresponding expected backgrounds from non-tt Standard Model processes are estimated using data-driven methods and determined to be 12.2 \u00b1 3.9 events and 2.5 \u00b1 0.6 events, respectively. The kinematic properties of the selected events are consistent with SM tt production. The inclusive top quark pair production cross-section is measured to be \u03c3 tt = 145 \u00b1 31(stat.) +42 \u221227 (syst.) pb.",

The measurement of the top quark pair production cross-section (\u03c3 tt ) in the various decay channels is interesting for several reasons. Uncertainties on the theoretical predictions are now at the level of 10% and a comparison with experimental measurements performed in different channels will ultimately allow a precision test of the predictions of perturbative QCD. In addition, the abundant tt sample which is expected to be produced in the first years of data-taking can be exploited for improving many aspects of detector performance. Finally, tt production is an important background ? e-mail: atlas.secretariat@cern.ch in various searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and new physics may also give rise to additional tt production mechanisms or modification of the top quark decay channels.",

Events with a tt pair can be classified as 'single-lepton', 'dilepton', or 'all hadronic' by the decays of the two W bosons: a pair of quarks (W \u2192 qq) or a lepton-neutrino pair (W \u2192`\u03bd), where`refers to a lepton. At the Tevatron the dominant production mechanism is qq annihilation, and the tt cross section at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV and at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV have been measured by D0 and CDF [6][7][8][9] in all channels.

The singlelepton mode, with a branching ratio 2 of 37.9% (combining e and \u03bc channels), and the dilepton mode, with a branching ratio of 6.5% (combining ee, \u03bc\u03bc and e\u03bc channels), both give rise to final states with at least one lepton, missing transverse energy and jets, some with b flavour. The crosssection measurements in both modes are based on a straightforward counting method. The number of signal events is obtained in a signal enriched sample after background subtraction. The main background contributions are determined using data-driven methods, since the theoretical uncertainties on the normalisation of these backgrounds are relatively large. For both single-lepton and dilepton channels, alternative methods of signal extraction and/or background estimation are explored. In particular, two template shape fitting methods, which use additional signal regions to exploit the kinematic information in the events, are developed for the single-lepton mode. In this paper these two fitting methods serve as cross-checks of the counting method. The methods also provide alternative data-driven estimates of backgrounds and are expected to become more precise when more data become available.",

The uncertainty due to ISR/FSR is evaluated by studies using the ACERMC generator [28] interfaced to PYTHIA, and by varying the parameters controlling ISR and FSR. For the ISR the variation ranges are similar to the ranges used in Perugia Soft and Perugia Hard tunes [29]. For the FSR the parameter variation ranges are larger those recommended in [30].

The predictions of the total cross-section have uncertainties of up to O(50%) [31] increasing with jet multiplicity. Total W/Z cross-section predictions are not used in the cross-section analysis, but are used in simulation predictions shown in selected Figures. The heavy-flavor fractions in the W/Z + jets samples are always taken from simulation, as the present data sample is too small to measure them. Here a fully correlated 100% uncertainty on the predicted fractions of bb and cc quark pairs is assumed, as well as a separate 100% uncertainty on the fraction of events with a single c quark. The uncertainty on the shape of W + jets kinematic distributions, used in fit-based cross-checks of the single-lepton analysis, is assessed by changing the choice of factorisation scale from m(W ) 2 + P p 2 T (jet) to m(W ) 2 , and by comparing ALPGEN with SHERPA [32].

This operating point yields a 50% btagging efficiency in simulated tt events The sign of L/\u03c3 (L) is given by the sign of the projection of the decay length vector on the jet axis. The typical probability for a light jet to be mis-identified as a b-jet ranges from 0.002 to 0.01 for jets with p T ranging 20 and 200 GeV [38]. The missing transverse energy is constructed from the vector sum of all calorimeter cells contained in topological clusters. Calorimeter cells are associated with a parent physics object in a chosen order: electrons, jets and muons, such that a cell is uniquely associated to a single physics object [39]. Cells belonging to electrons are calibrated at the electron energy scale, but omitting the out-of-cluster correction to avoid double cell-energy counting, while cells belonging to jets are taken at the corrected energy scale used for jets. Finally, the contributions from muons passing selection requirements are included, and the contributions from any calorimeter cells associated to the muons are subtracted. The remaining clustered energies not associated to electrons or jets are included at the EM scale.",

Both the b-tagging efficiency and mistag fraction measured in data depend strongly on the jet kinematics.

If r and f are known, the number of events with non-prompt muons can be calculated from (1) given a measured N loose and N std . The relative efficiencies r and f are measured in data in control samples enriched in either prompt or non-prompt muons. The key issue in selecting these control regions is that they should be kinematically representative of the signal region so that the measured control-region efficiency can be applied in the signal region. An inclusive Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 control sample is used to measure the prompt muon efficiency r = 0.990 \u00b1 0.003. No statistically significant dependence on the jet multiplicity is observed. For the measurement of the non-prompt muon efficiency two control regions are used: a Sample A with low missing transverse energy (E miss T < 10 GeV) and at least one jet with p T > 25 GeV, and a Sample B with the nominal missing transverse energy requirement (E miss T > 20 GeV), at least one jet with p T > 25 GeV, and a high muon impact parameter significance. Sample A is dominated by QCD multijet events as most QCD multi-jet events have little real E miss T and the cross-section is comparatively large. The contribution from events with prompt muons from W /Z + jets which remains in the E miss T < 10 GeV region has to be subtracted. Since the contribution of these processes is not accurately known, it is evaluated in an iterative procedure: the initial value obtained for f is used to predict the number of leptons in the full E miss T range. The excess of candidate lepton events in data is attributed to prompt muons from W /Z + jets, whose contribution to the E miss T < 10 GeV region is then subtracted, obtaining a new value for f . The procedure converges in few iterations and it results in f A = 0.382 \u00b1 0.007, where the quoted uncertainty is statistical only. Sample B is kinematically close to the signal region, but the large impact parameter significance requirement selects muons that are incompatible with originating from the primary vertex and the sample is thus enriched in non-prompt muons.

This method depends crucially on the understanding of the background, but makes minimal assumptions on tt signal properties for the yield calculation. For the QCD multi-jet and W + jets backgrounds, the datadriven estimates described in detail in Sects. 5.3 and 5.4 are used, while for the expected background from Z + jets and single-top production, simulation estimates are used. Table 1 shows the complete overview of background contributions that are used in this calculation. The observed yields, the total expected background yields and the resulting tt signal yields for the e + jets, \u03bc + jets and combined channels are shown in Table 3. The product of acceptance and branching fraction of tt events in the \u22654-jet tagged signal region, measured from Monte-Carlo samples and quoted in Sect. 5.1, is used together with the value of the integrated luminosity to extract the cross-section (\u03c3 tt ) from the observed event yield. The resulting cross-sections are shown in Sect. 5.5.3. Table 3 Observed event yield, estimated total background and tt signal using the counting method in the b-tagged \u22654-jet bin, for electrons and muons separately and combined. The total background consists of the sum of individual backgrounds listed in Table 1, choosing the datadriven estimate for W + jets (instead of the simulation-based W + jets estimate used in the 'total (non-tt )' row of Table 1). The uncertainty on the total background includes statistical uncertainties in control regions and systematic uncertainties. The first quoted uncertainty on the tt signal yield is statistical, while the second is from the systematics on the background estimation  Table 4 provides a detailed breakdown of the total systematic uncertainties on the cross-section for this method. The components listed under 'Object selection' relate to sources discussed in Sect. 4.1. The components listed under 'Background rates' relate to the uncertainties on background estimates detailed in Sects. 5.3 and 5.4. The components listed under 'Signal simulation' relate to sources discussed in Sect. 3.1. The largest systematic uncertainty is due to the normalisation of the QCD multi-jet background in the e + jets channel, followed by the uncertainties which affect mainly the tt acceptance, like jet energy reconstruction, b-tagging and ISR/FSR. The dependence of the measured cross-section on the assumed top-quark mass is small. A change of \u00b11 GeV in the assumed top-quark mass results in a change of \u22131% in the cross-section.",

A simulation-based correction is applied to the 3-jet tagged background fraction to obtain the 4-jet tagged background fraction that accounts for expected differences in the background composition.

Contributions from real leptons due to W + jets in the fake lepton control region are subtracted using simulated data. The dominant systematic uncertainty on the W + jets background, as determined by the matrix method, comes from the possible difference in the mixture of processes where the efficiency for fake leptons f is measured, di-jet events and, where it is applied, the signal region. For electrons, a larger contribution is expected from heavy flavour events in the signal region due to tt \u2192`\u03bdbjj b events. This effect is accounted for by measuring the dependence of the efficiency for fake leptons on the heavy-flavour fraction and calculating a corrected efficiency for fake leptons based on the expected heavy-flavour fraction in the signal region in simulation studies. The fake estimate in the data includes contributions from events with tight and loose leptons, whose contributions have opposite signs. This can lead to some negative background estimates in the case of small statistics, but always consistent with zero. The results of the matrix method for the non-Z background are shown in Table 7 for 0, 1 and \u22652 jet bins. The results for the signal region (\u22652 jets) is also reported in Table 6.",

The first (the 'weighting method') uses fake candidates in the single lepton sample and a fake rate to build an event weight for the fake lepton event. It uses a less restrictive loose definition and so probes the extrapolation of the fake rate f to the signal region. The method gives results consistent with the matrix method, as shown in Table 7. The second (the 'fitting method') makes no assumptions about the relative mixture of fake-lepton mechanisms, but uses data-derived templates in variables which can discriminate between real and fake leptons to fit for the fake-lepton fraction in the signal region. These variables are the expected lepton isolation and the number of high-threshold hits in the transition radiation tracker, allowing to distinguish electrons from heavy flavour decays or conversions. For the signal region the fitting method predicts 0.01 +0.97 \u22120 \u00b1 0.01 non-W boson events for the ee channel, 0.01 +0.29 \u22120 \u00b1 0.01 for the \u03bc\u03bc channel, and 0.13 +0.42 \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.14 for the e\u03bc channel.

The modelling of the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 is cross-checked in the e\u03bc channel in the 0-jet bin, where five events are observed in data versus a total expectation of 3.1 events, with an expected Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 contribution of 2.4 events.

Sources of systematic uncertainties are grouped into subsets that are uncorrelated to each other. However each group can have correlated effects on multiple signal and background estimates. The relationship between the channels is enforced by identifying the \u03b1 j common to different channels in the construction of the combined likelihood function. Ensembles of pseudo-data were generated and the resulting estimate of the cross-section was confirmed to be unbiased. The method is the same as the  one used in [44] and described in [45]; however, in this case systematic uncertainties are modelled with gamma distributions, which are more suitable priors for large systematics than truncated Gaussians [46]. In the small systematic uncertainty limit, the gamma distribution coincides with the conventional choice of a Gaussian. Table 11 lists the cross-sections and signal significance for the single-lepton, dilepton and the combined channels with the corresponding statistical and systematic uncertainties extracted from the likelihood fit. By combining all five channels, the background-only hypothesis is excluded at a significance of 4.8\u03c3 obtained with the approximate method of [45]. If Gaussian distributions are assumed for all systematic uncertainties, a significance of 5.1\u03c3 is obtained. The absence of bias in the fit is validated by pseudo-experiments. Similarly, the traditional hybrid Bayesian-frequentist approach in which the \u03b1 j are randomised in an ensemble of pseudo-experiments finds a signal significance consistent with the results from the likelihood method within 0.1\u03c3 . The results also agree with those obtained from an alternative method based on a purely Bayesian methodology.",

The cross-sections measured in each of the five subchannels are consistent with each other and kinematic properties of the selected events are consistent with SM tt production. The measured tt cross-section is in good agreement with the measurement in the dilepton channel by CMS [10], Fig. 9 Top quark pair-production cross-section at hadron colliders as measured by CDF and D0 at Tevatron, CMS and ATLAS (this measurement).
