            "text": "Reactor neutrino experiments have played a critical role in the 60-year-long history of neutrinos. After the discovery of the neutrino by Reines and Cowan [1] in 1956, early searches for oscillation with reactor neutrinos in late 1970s and 1980s turned out to be controversial, but led to much better understanding of the reactor neutrino flux. Palo Verde [2] and CHOOZ [3] introduced modern particle physics technology into reactor neutrino experiments such as detector Monte Carlo and complex veto design in the 1990s. Detector systematics were well understood although no oscillation at \u223c 1 km was found. KamLAND [4] found reactor neutrino oscillation at a 180 km baseline and tackled the degeneracy in solar neutrino oscillation parameters in 2002. Backgrounds studies were well advanced. Based on these experiences, Daya Bay [5], Double Chooz [6], and RENO [7] were designed with unprecedented precision in 2000s and finally measured the smallest mixing angle \u03b8 13 by observing the oscillation at \u223c 1 km, which led the neutrino physics into the precision era. The next generation experiment JUNO, expected to operate in 2020, will further advance the capability of reactor neutrino experiments to determine the neutrino mass ordering and precisely measure several oscillation parameters [8].",

Almost the entire parameter region suggested by the Bugey experiment was excluded. Later the Bugey-3 experiment [26] deployed new detector modules at 15 m, 40 m and 95 m from the Bugey reactor to search for neutrino oscillations. Again, no oscillations were observed, and the exclusion region in the oscillation parameter space was largely extended.",

To suppress the neutron background, a unique segmented detector was designed, with a target consisting of 11\u00d76 cells filled with Gadolinium (Gd) loaded liquid scintillator. The IBD signature was by a triple coincidence of one high energy trigger, due to the positron ionization or neutron capture cascade core, and at least two additional low energy triggers, resulting from positron annihilation \u03b3s or neutron capture \u03b3s. Despite this, the neutron backgrounds are still the overwhelming source of uncertainties and a swap method was specially designed to suppress backgrounds [31].",

Comparing to the segmented design of Palo Verde, the homogeneous design of CHOOZ gave full-absorption peak of 8 MeV \u03b3s from n-capture on Gd, leading to high efficiency and smaller uncertainty on neutron detection. The fast neutron backgrounds were much less than that in Palo Verde due to 10 times larger overburden. Since the PMTs of CHOOZ directly contacted with the scintillator, the radiation from PMT glass, particularly 40 K, resulted in large low energy backgrounds. Furthermore, the varying energy threshold caused by the fast degradation of its gadolinium-loaded scintillator resulted in a large efficiency uncertainty.",

It was tempting to invoke explanations based on the neutrino oscillation hypothesis, and these experiments allowed several possible solutions in the oscillation parameter space of sin 2 2\u03b8 and \u2206m 2 . The solutions are usually referred to as large mixing angle solution (LMA), small mixing angle solution (SMA), low \u2206m 2 solution (LOW) and vacuum (VAC) oscillation. In 2001, the SNO solar neutrino experiment gave the \"smoking gun\" evidence of the neutrino oscillation explanation to the Solar Neutrino Problem.

The balloon is supported by ropes in a buffer of dodecane and isoparaffin oils between the balloon and a 18-m-diameter stainless steel (SS) sphere. A non-rigid balloon led to a not well-defined target mass, and 2.1% uncertainty in the total LS mass was determined by the measurement with flow meters during detector filling. Due to high backgrounds from the balloon, a fiducial volume cut was applied, resulting in a large error (4.1%) which relied on the vertex reconstruction. Later a 4\u03c0 calibration system [38] significantly reduced the systematic errors. The vertex bias was reduced from 5 cm to 3 cm, leading to an improvement of fiducial volume uncertainty from 4.7% to 1.8% [39].",

The near-far cancellation has been crucial for these three experiments that all aimed for sub-percent-level systematics, in particular, Daya Bay was designed at an \u223c0.4% uncertainty in order to achieve a sensitivity of 0.01 (90% CL) in sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . There are three main sources of systematic uncertainties: reactor, background, and detector. More discussions about the uncertainties are in Section 3.3 and Section 4. Table   1 shows the advances in suppressing correlated uncertainties via relative measurements (the projected uncertainties after near-far cancellation are taken from References 45,47,and 50). Around 2008, the global fit [50,51,52] hinted the possibility of non-zero \u03b8 13 . After the indications from T2K [53], MINOS [54], and Double Chooz [6] in 2011, Daya Bay discovered the oscillation due to \u03b8 13 at 5.2\u03c3 [5] in 2012, which was soon confirmed by RENO [7].",

In the early 2000s, the combined limit from Palo Verde, CHOOZ and Super Kamiokande was sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.12 (90% C.L., if \u2206m 2 23 = 0.0024 eV 2 ), and the common intuition in the neutrino community was that \u03b8 13 would be tiny. Thus, it was generally believed that the NMO should be determined at long baseline experiments using accelerator neutrino beams. The possibility of distinguishing the NMO by exploring the effect of interference between the atmospheric-and solar-\u2206m 2 driven oscillations was first discussed, together with exploring the high-LMA MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem [69,70]. Then the capability of determining the NMO by reactor neutrino experiments at a intermediate baseline was investigated by using a Fourier transform to the the L/E spectrum [71]. A more advanced Fourier analysis to the L/E spectrum was performed [72,73]   The precise prediction of the antineutrino spectrum for JUNO is needed. Unlike Daya Bay, it is unpractical to build a near detector for JUNO. However, Daya Bay can be treated as a virtual near site, based on that JUNO has similar reactor cores as Daya Bay, thus a virtual relative measurement can be taken, see discussions in Section 3.2.",

In these measurements, sample foils were placed into a reactor and exposed to neutrons for one or two days. A high precision electron spectrometer recorded the emitted \u03b2 spectra, which were then inverted to the antineutrino spectra by fitting the observed \u03b2 spectra to a set of 30 virtual \u03b2-branches. With the Q-value and the branching ratios of the virtual \u03b2-branches, the corresponding neutrino spectra could be computed out. The uncertainty of the antineutrino spectrum by this conversion process was estimated to be 2.7%. These experiments did not perform similar measurements for 238 U, which only fissions with fast neutrons. Combined with the ab initio calculations for 238 U by Vogel [23], with uncertainties of <10%, the obtained reactor neutrino spectra are referred to as the ILL+Vogel model. Since 238 U only contributes to \u223c 8% of the total reactor antineutrino flux, the error introduced to the total flux is less than 1%.",

With on-going dedicated detector studies and more data, the precision will be improved. When predicting flux and spectrum for future reactor neutrino experiments like JUNO from the Daya Bay measurements, the uncertainty could be much smaller than the above absolute uncertainty since the relative energy non-linearity between the Daya Bay and JUNO detectors could be measured much easier than the absolute energy non-linearity. The Daya Bay measured spectrum is valid only for given fission fractions. Fortunately the average fission fractions of light water reactors are similar when integrating over a certain time. The small deviation from the Daya Bay average fission fraction can be complemented with the inversion models. There are many short-baseline experiments planned or undergoing with different detector technologies.",

Therefore, the reflectors are only installed at the top and the bottom, and the cylinder wall is equipped with black acrylic sheets at the equator of the PMTs.

The FLUKA results were confirmed later by a Geant4 simulation [108], where new hadronic processes were included and secondary neutrons were properly handled. The broad continuum spectrum of fast neutrons can be revealed by expanding the selection of the \u03bd e candidates with relaxed prompt energy cuts. No physical mechanism guarantees a particular shape, e.g, flat or linear, for the fast neutron spectra, because such backgrounds highly depend on the design and performance of the muon veto system, as well as the veto strategy in analysis. The three \u03b8 13 experiments observed different shapes of fast neutrons. In Daya Bay, although the simulation supported the validity of a linear extrapolation of this background into the \u03bd e signal region, more robust data-driven approaches were used to estimate this background and uncertainties [55].

This method was found to have large uncertainty at high muon rate, because the time constants for the \u03b2-n emitters and \u03bd e signal are nearly degenerate. Since most 9 Li/ 8 He are produced by showering muons, reducing the minimum ionizing muons in the muon sample would enhance the time correlation between muon and 9 Li/ 8 He. Daya Bay observed significant \u03b2-n production from muons with no associated shower in LS [5,62], by comparing muon samples with and without follow-on neutrons, based on the hypothesis that the 9 Li/ 8 He production was most-likely accompanied with neutron generation, as shown in Figure 5. This indicated that, although the 9 Li/ 8 He yield was expected to be much lower for a muon not showering inside the detector, it was compensated by the much higher rate of non-showering muons.  The above approach significantly reduced the largest background error for Daya Bay. In the most recent Daya Bay result [55], more than half of the 9 Li/ 8 He production followed the small fraction of muons with associated showers. The estimates for muons with lower reconstructed energy, were inconclusive due to degeneracy of the \u03b2-n and \u03bd e time constants in the distribution relative to those muons. Instead, \u03b2-n production by these muons was estimated using the neutron-tagged muon sample. The neutron-tagging efficiency for \u03b2-n production was assumed to be the same for muons that identified as showering or nonshowering. A systematic uncertainty of \u223c 40% was assigned, according to the variation in the observed tagging efficiency versus the muon deposit energy with this assumption.",

The moun system at each site of Daya Bay consists of a water pool acting as water Cerenkov detector, and a plane of resistive plate chambers (RPC) on top of it. In addition, each pool is divided into two independent water Cerenkov detectors: inner water system (IWS) and outer water system (OWS), optically isolated with Tyvek. Double chooz has a LS veto detector and a plastic scintillator tracker on top. KamLAND and RENO uses a water Cerenkov detector as veto. While the veto of KamLAND has a not very high efficiency, that of the \u03b8 13 experiments perform very well, e.g. Daya Bay IWS has an efficiency of 99.98\u00b10.01%. Having very good muon tracking is more important for JUNO to reject muon-induced long-live isotope backgrounds. The design will be described in Section 5.1.3. For the JUNO detector, a chimney on top of the acrylic sphere is designed for filling LS and operating the calibration systems. Based on the lessons on the chimneys of KamLAND, Double Chooz and RENO, JUNO will equip a light blocker at the chimney bottom to prevent the light generated inside the chimney from entering the main LS volume. In addition, the inner surface of chimney will be black. A detailed MC study indicated that the stopping muon background would be negligible.",

If both \u03b3 rays from the scattering and capture processes enter the scintillating region, it could mimic a \u03bd e signal. To mitigate this background, the 241 Am-13 C sources in the two off-axis ACUs were removed from each of the Daya Bay far-site detectors.

The presence of iron not only decreases optical transparency in the sensitive region of the PMT, but also degrades chemical stability of Gd-LS. The radiation from U/Th decay chains can form accidental coincidences mimicking \u03bd e signal. Particularly, the emitted alpha particles can produce correlated background via 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O reactions (see Section 4.6). Daya Bay conducted purifications such as filtration after melting, distillation and recrystallization to purify PPO, and thin-film vaccum distillation to purify THMA [92]. In addition, a co-precipitation approach was developed to remove U/Th from the raw materialGdCl 3 \u2022 xH 2 O [99]. The long-lived radium in the U/Th chain cannot be removed by this approach but it will not complex with the ligand like Gd and U/Th. This approach both removed the radioactive isotopes and significantly improved the optical transparency [92]. An important source of non-linear and non-uniform energy responses in LS is due to complex absorption and re-emission processes for scintillation and Cerenkov photons. Precise simulation of the light propagation in LS is highly desired, and can consequently reduce the energy scale uncertainty. A generic optical model in Monte Carlo has been developed to describe the complete absorption and re-emission processes (see Section 5.2.3), which is expected to significantly improve the understanding of the LS non-linearity.",

Daya Bay constructed an empirical model [63] to describe the scintillator nonlinearity for electrons, then the relationship from the e \u2212 nonlinearity to the response for \u03b3 and e + could be derived by Monte Carlo simulation. The energy model was determined by a fit to monoenergetic \u03b3 lines from various radioactive sources and the \u03b2 spectrum from the cosmogenic 12 B events.

Double neutron captures can also mimic an IBD signal. Palo Verde suffered from fast neutrons, which was not easy to model at that time, and the background estimation from simulation had a large uncertainty. A swap method[31] was invented to suppress the uncertainty from neutron-induced backgrounds, based on the fact that the \u03bd e signals and neutron backgrounds showed different symmetry behavior if the selection cuts were reversed by imposing the neutron cuts on the prompt signal and the positron cuts on the delayed signal. It reduced the measurement errors on the \u03bd e flux from \u223c 20% to \u223c 10%.The best shielding to attenuate fast neutrons is water, rather than sand or steel, because it is rich in protons, radio-pure, and cost-effective. The water buffer can provide the best tagging of muons if equipped with photomultipliers acting as a water Cerenkov detector. The lateral distance that fast neutrons can travel in water from the muon track, is approximately exponential with an average distance of 0.7\u223c 0.8 m.

Stopping muons which entered through and stopped inside the chimney, if failing to be identified by the veto system, could produce correlated backgrounds. Because the stopping muons in the chimney have a different hit pattern than a point-like source in the target, the likelihood with the best-fit vertex was used to reject such backgrounds. In Daya Bay, the automated calibration units are integrated on the top of antineutrino detector and submerged in water, thus the background induced by stopping muons is negligible.",

            "text": "The final design of JUNO central detector consists of 20 kton low-background LS held by an acrylic sphere 35.4 m in diameter and 120 mm in thickness. The acrylic sphere will be fabricated on-site by bonding \u223c 260 pieces of large acrylic panels, and is supported by a latticed shell made of stainless steel. About 18,000 20-inch PMTs, instrumented on the latticed shell, look inward to the LS and provide a maximum photocathode coverage of 75%. In the gaps between the 20-inch PMTs, around 36,000 3-inch PMTs will be installed, providing additional 3% photocathode coverage, enhancing the capability and dynamic range of measuring cosmic muons, and serving as an independent calorimeter to calibrate the energy nonlinearity. The whole structure is submerged in a ultra-pure water pool (see Section 5.1.3).For this \"Acrylic Sphere\" design, the biggest challenge is to build and support the world's largest acrylic sphere. A reliable design has been achieved, after several years of prototyping and bonding tests, mechanical tests and FEA validation. Issues such as temperature variation, earthquake safety, single point failure analysis, installation process and PMT mounting, etc, have been extensively studied and detailed engineering are basically finished. The energy response has a complicated shape near the edge of acrylic sphere due to the internal reflection, thus a comprehensive calibration system is designed, as discussed in Section 5.1.2.Good progress has been made on implosion protection of PMTs, highly reliable PMT potting, under-water electronics, and low Radon concentration in water.In the abandoned \"Balloon\" option, a transparent PA-film balloon holds the LS target, and is immersed in a LAB buffer which is contained in a stainless steel vessel (SSV). The leaks of such big balloon, most likely unavoidable, could be a show stopper. In the worst scenario, if the buffer LAB becomes scintillator, the radiation from PMTs and SSV will provide vast number of light noise overlapping with the \u03bd e signal. The MC simulation indicated significant degradation in the energy resolution and decreased the NMO sensitivity by \u2206\u03c7 2 \u223c 4.7. The design for chimney and calibration system is more complicated. The control of radioactivity contamination on such large surface (\u223c 4000 m 2 ) is non-trivial. Two 12-m-diameter balloons",

            "text": "A large water Cerenkov detector, 44 m in height and 43.5 m in diameter, surrounds the central detector. The stainless steel truss that supports the acrylic sphere automatically divides the water pool into two optically isolated zones: the inner water shield and the outer water Cerenkov detector with \u223c 2000 PMTs. The inner shield attenuates the radiation from PMTs and steel latticed shell, and the outer detector actively tags the muons. The minimum water thickness is \u223c 3.9 m to ensure sufficiently low fast neutron backgrounds. The target tracker of the OPERA experiment is re-used to cover the top of the water pool in a three layer arrangement. This external veto detector will provide optimum muon tracking and cross check with the central detector to ensure a highly efficient muon veto. The performance of the 20-inch PMT is significantly affected by the Earth magnetic field, thus compensation coils are designed inside the water pool, to suppress the field by at least one order of magnitude. 5.1.4 FADC Readout and Trigger JUNO will record the full waveform for each PMT channel by using high resolution Flash ADC (FADC) with 1 GHz sampling frequency. Then the number of photoelectrons can be reconstructed by a de-convolution method based on fast fourier transform (FFT) technique, which resolves the hit time of each photoelectron from the measured waveform. This can largely remove the non-linear response from the electronics side. Given the vast number of PMTs and long distance from PMTs to the electronics room, a highly-integrated readout electronics is designed to be integrated in the PMT housing, to reduce the number of cables and noise. The PMT base circuit, analog frontend and digitizer are enclosed in the waterproof potting shell. In addition, a customized high voltage (HV) module is also integrated to provide the PMT bias voltage. The capability of filtering low energy (< 0.2 MeV) noise event, predominantly by the coincidence of PMT dark noise in the trigger time window, is important for studying supernova neutrinos and solar neutrinos. The multiplicity trigger, which utilizes the received number of over-threshold channels, can effectively and robustly reject the PMT dark noises. Furthermore, JUNO trigger system employed an online correction to the time-of-flight (TOF) of photons, with a TOF look-up table that is constructed by dividing the LS volume into voxels. Then the PMT hits are aligned into a 50 ns narrow window for triggering, allowing significant removal of noise and efficient triggering for physics events below 0.2 MeV. In the case of a supernova burst at 10 kpc from the Earth, it will register several thousands of events within \u223c 10 s in the JUNO detector. The readout system can work in pipeline mode to record all the waveforms.",

The MCP has intrinsically high CE thanks to the simple assembly of the MCP structure.Successful prototypes of the 20-inch MCP-PMT were made following such an approach in the past years. The photoelectron CE depends on the MCP open area fraction, the angular and energy distributions of electrons emitted from the photocathode, the potential difference between the PMT photocathode and the MCP surface, as well as the secondary electron emission from the MCP electrode. The structure and operational parameters of the 20-inch MCP-PMT have been optimized to improve the photoelectron CE.",

However, the segmented design resulted in no monochromatic peak, causing difficulties for understanding the energy resolution, efficiency and systematic errors. On the contrast, the homogeneous design of CHOOZ gave a full-absorption peak of 8 MeV \u03b3s from the n-capture on Gd, leading to high efficiency and smaller uncertainty on neutron detection. Palo Verde had 12 tons of target and only \u223c 10% efficiency, whereas CHOOZ had only 5 tons Gd-LS but \u223c 70% efficiency.Segmented detectors have larger edge effects. Palo Verde observed two time constants for the neutron capture due to the inhomogeneity of its target. The faster time constant (27.1 \u00b5s) was for the neutrons remaining in the Gd-LS target, and the slower constant(76.8    ",

The as-built surveys show that the actual diameter have a variation of only 2 mm, corresponding to 0.17% variation of volume. This is comparable to the target mass variation which is controlled to be 0.19% by precise load cell measurement during filling. Without this gamma catcher layer, the characteristic 8 MeV signal of reactor neutrinos from neutron capture on gadolinium will have a large tail for events near the edge of the target. A cut on the tail to select neutrons, e.g. at 5 or 6 MeV, could introduce large uncertainty due the energy scale difference among detectors.A very thick gamma catcher may eliminate this uncertainty, while the actual thickness for the three experiments ranges from 42.5 cm to 70 cm, balancing with the statistical uncertainty (i.e. target mass). The buffer oil between the outer acrylic vessel and the outermost stainless steel vessel shields the radioactivity from the PMT glass and other detector materials.One possible large source of uncertainty is the hydrogen and gadolinium content in the liquid scintillator, which is 0.8% for CHOOZ. The \u03b8 13 experiments mixed Gd-LS and LS for all detectors in \"one batch\" to make the detectors identical. In Daya Bay, 185 ton Gd-LS was produced in 4-ton batches using the same batch of materials, and stored in five 40-ton",

The LS between the inner and outer acrylic vessels absorb \u03b3 rays leaking out from the target. acrylic tanks. Each tank has a built-in circulation system to mix the Gd-LS uniformly. 4 ton Gd-LS was taken from each of the five storage tanks to fill into one detector, which has 20 ton target mass, to ensure identical Gd-LS content for all eight detectors.Besides the designs common in all three experiments, Daya Bay detectors have several unique features, e.g. multiple detectors at one site and the movable detector design.Daya Bay has two detectors at each of the two near sites and four at the far site. Multiple detectors at the same site could cross-check detector systematics and statistically reduce the uncertainties. The Daya Bay detector is designed to have 0.38% uncertainty for each,",

The ACUs are used to regularly deploy sources along the central axis, and similar technologies worked excellently at Daya Bay. The CLS system can deploy sources at different locations in one given vertical plane. The GTCS allows deploying sources along a given longitude of the acrylic sphere to calibrate the energy response at the LS edge. The ROV can scan the whole LS volume to do a 4\u03c0 calibration.

JUNO, as a ultralow background LS detector with excellent energy resolution, provides good opportunity for searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2. The concept is to build a clean balloon to hold the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 target and insert into the central region of JUNO LS. Ultra-low background is the key for a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay search, thus dissolving 136 Xe-enriched, purified xenon gas into LS is a good choice. Of course doping other elements such as 130 Te is also possible as LS technology develops. With an in-depth study about the backgrounds, JUNO was found to have potential to reach a sensitivity of > 1.8\u00d710 28 yr at 90% C.L. with \u223c 50 tons of fiducial 136 Xe and 5 years exposure [132], where the corresponding sensitivity on the effective neutrino mass could reach <5-12 meV, covering completely the allowed region of inverted neutrino mass ordering.
