The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb1. The results include measurements of the scale and resolution of \u00ae pmiss T, and detailed studies of events identified with anomalous \u00ae pmiss T . The performance is presented of a \u00ae pmiss T reconstruction algorithm that mitigates the effects of multiple proton-proton interactions, using the \"pileup per particle identification\" method. The performance is shown of an algorithm used to estimate the compatibility of the reconstructed \u00ae pmiss T with the hypothesis that it originates from resolution effects. \u00a9 2019 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.",
