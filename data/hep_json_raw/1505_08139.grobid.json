The cross-section is measured in the rapidity range 2 < y(\u03a5) < 4.5 where the muons are reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7(\u00b5 \u00b1 ) < 4.5. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.9 fb \u22121 and was collected at centreof-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The measured \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) production crosssections are \u03c3(pp \u2192 p\u03a5(1S)p) = 9.0 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 1.7 pb and \u03c3(pp \u2192 p\u03a5(2S)p) = 1.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 pb, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The \u03a5(1S) crosssection is also measured as a function of rapidity and is found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions. An upper limit is set at 3.4 pb at the 95% confidence level for the exclusive \u03a5(3S) production cross-section, including possible contamination from \u03c7 b (3P ) \u2192 \u03a5(3S)\u03b3 decays.",

            "text": "Central exclusive production (CEP) of \u03a5(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) resonances in pp collisions is thought to occur by photoproduction through the exchange of a photon and a pomeron (a colour-singlet system) between two protons, as illustrated in figure 1. Since the protons do not dissociate, typically only a small component of momentum transverse to the beam direction (p T ) is exchanged in the interaction. The photoproduction of \u03a5 resonances at LHCb can be computed using perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), given the high photon-proton centre-of-mass energy, W , and the cross-section depends on the square of the gluon parton-density function, g(x), where Bjorken-x is the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the gluon [1]. Measurements of the production cross-sections for the \u03a5(nS) resonances in the forward region covered by the LHCb detector are sensitive to g(x) in the region of small x down to approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , where the knowledge of g(x) is limited. Furthermore, predictions for the \u03a5(nS) cross-sections at leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong-interaction coupling differ greatly for the values of W probed in \u03a5(nS) resonance production, and there are significant variations depending on the models used to describe the \u03a5 wave function and the t-channel exchange [1][2][3].",

            "text": "Quarkonia photoproduction has been studied in exclusive production at HERA [4][5][6][7][8][9], the Tevatron [10] and the LHC [11][12][13]. At LHCb, exclusive production is associated with the absence of significant detector activity apart from that associated with the exclusive candidate. The background from proton dissociation occurring outside the detector acceptance is characterised as having a value of \u03a5 candidate p T which is larger than that for exclusive production. In this article, the exclusive production cross-section of \u03a5(nS) resonances is measured in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state where both muons lie in the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) range 2 < \u03b7(\u00b5 \u00b1 ) < 4.5 and the \u03a5(nS) candidate is reconstructed in the rapidity (y) range 2 < y(\u03a5(nS)) < 4.5. The pp data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.9 fb \u22121 at a pp centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 2.0 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Given the limited statistical precision, the data sets are combined to measure the production cross-sections. The LHCb detector and the simulated event samples are outlined in section 2. In section 3 selection criteria are discussed, which exploit the absence of detector activity other than that associated with the \u03a5(nS) candidate. The signal efficiency and the various sources of background are also described. In section 4 two fits are described, which allow the determination of the exclusive signal yield: by fitting the \u03a5(nS) invariant mass spectrum in order to separate \u03a5 resonances from dimuon continuum background; and by fitting the \u03a5(nS) candidate p 2 T distribution to distinguish exclusively produced \u03a5 resonances from those originating in hard interactions. Systematic uncertainties are summarised in section 5, and the measurements of the cross-sections are discussed in section 6. Finally, for the \u03a5(1S) the differential cross-section, as a function of \u03a5(1S) candidate rapidity, is presented.",

The event is excluded if more than one proton-proton interaction occurs, causing a larger number of additional SPD hits or extra tracks to be reconstructed. The probability for an exclusive \u03a5 event not to feature additional activity from another pp interaction in the same beam crossing is determined as the fraction of events containing no activity, according to these criteria, in a randomly accepted, hence unbiased, sample. After subtracting the contribution of the dimuon candidate, an event may contain fewer than eight SPD hits and no reconstructed tracks in the backward direction or tracks in the forward region. The fraction of randomly triggered events passing these criteria, f SI , is found to be (23.63 \u00b1 0.04)% for the 7 TeV JHEP09(2015)084 data and (18.48 \u00b1 0.02)% for the 8 TeV data. The difference arises because of the different beam conditions in the two data-taking periods, leading to a different average number of proton-proton interactions per event. The reconstruction, trigger and offline selection efficiencies are determined using simulated samples, and the combined efficiency varies between 77% and 84%. For signal candidates that pass the trigger and reconstruction stages, the offline selection criteria are more than 99% efficient. The probability density function (PDF) used to model each \u03a5(nS) signal peak is a Gaussian function with modified tails (a double-sided crystal ball function [22]). The mass differences for the \u03a5(2S)-\u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(3S)-\u03a5(1S) resonances are taken from ref. [23]. The ratios of the \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) resolutions with respect to the \u03a5(1S) are fixed to the ratio of their masses with respect to the mass of the \u03a5(1S), following the procedure used in previous \u03a5 measurements using LHCb data [24].

The SuperChiC generator [16] models the pomeron-photon exchange and performs this extrapolation. Since the only published measurement of b \u03a5 has very low precision [8], the generator is tuned to reproduce the LHCb measurement of b J/\u03c8 = 5.7 \u00b1 0.1 GeV \u22122 c 2 [12] in exclusive J/\u03c8 production. The input values to SuperChiC are b 0 = 5.6 GeV \u22122 c 2 , \u03b1 = 0.2 GeV \u22122 c 2 and W 0 = 90 GeV. The fit PDF is obtained from the simulated samples with these inputs, and a kernel estimation is employed to derive a shape to fit to data [26]. It is assumed that the inelastic background component is distributed according to a single exponential function [12]. The slope and yield of this background function are free to vary in the fit. The total contamination from \u03c7 b (mP ) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03b3 decays is constrained to be the sum of the contributions in table 2 and enters the p 2 T fit by means of a Gaussian constraint. Given that no analysis of exclusive \u03c7 b production has been undertaken, and the consequent lack of knowledge of the exclusive purity of the very small sample of reconstructed \u03c7 b candidates, it is assumed that inelastic processes contribute half of this feed-down background and the same inelastic background PDF is employed as that used to model inelastic \u03a5(nS) production. For the exclusive component, the shape of the dimuon p 2 T PDF depends on the \u03c7 b (mP ) meson source, and the PDFs for each source, determined from simulation, are combined according to their relative contributions to the total feed-down yield.",

The feed-down background PDF is constructed using only contributions from the \u03c7 b1 (mP ) and \u03c7 b2 (mP ) background components, in equal parts, assuming no contribution from \u03c7 b0 (mP ) decays. Since it is not possible to resolve the spin states in data, we consider a conservative change where the nominal PDF is replaced with that for background originating from the decay of a \u03c7 b0 (mP ) meson. The fit to data is repeated and the change in exclusive purity is taken as the associated uncertainty. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the exclusive fraction of the \u03c7 b (mP ) feed-down background, which in turn affects the overall shape of the feed-down background used in the p 2 T spectrum. Since the size of the data set is too small to allow a data-driven estimate of the \u03c7 b (mP ) sample exclusive purity, the PDF for this purity is assumed to be uniform between 0% and 100%, and the effect of changing it by \u00b11 standard deviation (0.50 \u00b1 0.29) is therefore considered. The resulting change in the exclusive \u03a5(nS) sample purity is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The estimate of the yield of \u03c7 b (mP ) meson feed-down in data includes the determination of the photon reconstruction efficiency using simulated samples of \u03c7 b (mP ) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03b3 decays. Samples of B \u00b1 \u2192 J\u03c8K * \u00b1 (\u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 0 ) and B \u00b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u00b1 decays are used to validate the agreement between photon reconstruction efficiencies in data and simulation. An uncertainty of 5% is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the photon reconstruction efficiency to account for the small differences seen [27]. The resulting uncertainty is very small for the \u03a5(1S) but larger for the \u03a5(2S, 3S) samples where the relative contamination from the \u03c7 b (mP ) background is larger. These three systematic uncertainties on the cross-section are combined in quadrature and are presented as the 'feed-down b.g.' systematic uncertainty in table 3.",

The correction depends on the rapidity distribution in the simulated sample, which has a different shape to those of, for example, the predictions in figure 4a. To estimate the systematic uncertainty on the geometrical acceptance correction, the simulated samples are reweighted to obtain a uniform rapidity distribution within each rapidity bin, and the change in the geometrical acceptance is taken as the systematic uncertainty.
