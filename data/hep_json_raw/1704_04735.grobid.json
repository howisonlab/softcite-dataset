A comprehensive description of the transverse momentum and rapidity dependent production down to zero transverse momentum p T can be obtained with the Non-Relativistic Quantum ChromoDynamics (NRQCD) formalism combined with a Color Glass Condensate (CGC) description of the incoming protons [1].",

            "text": "The event multiplicity dependent production of charmonium, and also of charm quarks in general, is a fairly new topic of interest, and is believed to be suited to give new insights on processes on the parton level and on the interplay between the hard and soft mechanisms in particle production. ALICE has performed multiplicity dependent measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV of inclusive J/\u03c8 production at mid-and forward rapidity [2], and prompt J/\u03c8 , non-prompt J/\u03c8 and D-mesons production at mid-rapidity [3]. The general observation is an increase of open and hidden charm production with event multiplicity. For the J/\u03c8 production, multiplicities of about 4 times the mean values could be reached. The results are consistent with a linear, or stronger than linear increase. For the D-meson production, relative multiplicities of about 6 could be reached, with a stronger than linear increase at the highest multiplicities. Similar observations have been made by CMS for \u03a5(nS ) particles at mid-rapidity. They find a linear increase with event activity, when measuring it at forward rapidity, and a stronger than linear increase when measuring it at mid-rapidity [4].  Different theoretical models attribute the observed behavior to different underlying processes. In the PYTHIA 8 event generator [5], multi-parton interactions (MPI) are an important factor in charm quark production. Indeed, from MPI alone a stronger than linear scaling is expected for open charm production, as was demonstrated in [3]. Taking into account all sources of heavy quark production however, a more or less linear increase is predicted. In the EPOS 3 event generator [6], initial conditions are generated according to the Parton based Gribov-Regge formalism [7] followed by a hydrodynamical evolution of the system. Sources of particle production in this framework are parton ladders, each composed of a pQCD hard process with initial and final state radiation. This model predicts a stronger than linear increase with multiplicity [3].",

For tracking and selection of primary particles the Inner Tracking System (ITS) was used, and particle identification was done via specific energy loss in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). Combinatorial background from electrons originating from photon conversions was suppressed by usage of a prefilter on dielectron pairs with a low opening angle. In order to have access to high multiplicities, the data taking was performed using both a minimum bias trigger and a trigger on high event multiplicities, based on a large deposited charge in the ALICE V0 subdetector. This detector consists of two scintillator arrays at forward (2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1) and backward (\u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7) rapidity. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about L = 1.9 nb \u22121 for minimum bias events and L = 1.2 pb \u22121 for high multiplicity triggered events. Pile-up events were rejected if a second primary vertex with sufficient contributors could be reconstructed within one event. From a toy Monte Carlo study it is estimated that the remaining pile-up contribution is negligible in all multiplicity bins.",

As a cross-check also the distribution of like-sign pairs from the same event was used as a background estimator. The signal is extracted in 8 bins of the charged-particle multiplicity (indicated by the vertical lines in Fig. 1), the highest one corresponding to about 7 times the mean values. Figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution and the extracted signal in the bin corresponding to the highest multiplicity. In a final step the extracted yield and event multiplicities are normalized to the mean values in minimum bias events, obtained in the same analysis. Figure 3 shows the self-normalized inclusive J/\u03c8 yield (i.e. the yield per event divided by the mean yield per event in minimum bias collisions) in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at mid-rapidity as a function of the self-normalized charged-particle multiplicity. A smooth monotonic increase in the J/\u03c8 yield is observed, which at high multiplicities is clearly stronger than the increase in the charged-particle multiplicity.
