            "text": "Ernest Rutherford once said at the beginning of the twentieth century 'Theorists play games with their symbols while we discover truths about the Universe'. This was before the birth of the Bohr atom and quantum mechanics. At the beginning of the twenty-first century this sentence can probably be reverted, as the predictions of the theory are so successful that experimental discoveries of the last 40 years perfectly fit in the Standard Model (SM) theory framework. In this respect, the systematic exploration of the electroweak (EW) scale at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] could have represented an even greater confirmation of the theory predictions since most Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories and, in particular, low-energy Supersymmetry (SUSY) expect new particles with masses close to the EW scale. As it will be discussed extensively in this article, this is clearly not the case. The direct searches conducted at the first LHC run by the general purpose experiments ATLAS [2] and CMS [3] did not reveal the presence of any new particle beyond that of the Standard Model. In contrary, the Standard Model is now fully established by the discovery of the Higgs boson [4,5].",

The discussion of the results is split in three different sections, representing the main avenues of the SUSY searches at LHC: gluino and squarks of first/second generation at the energy frontier in Sect. 4, third-generation squarks in Sect. 5, and electroweak SUSY in Sect. 6. All assume Rparity conservation and prompt decay of the SUSY particles. Section 7 is devoted to escape routes beyond R-parity conservation and prompt decays, as well as more exotic SUSY scenarios.

Even if the LHC cannot explore the full SUSY phase space, it can probe extensively the low-energy (or weak-scale) realization of N = 1 SUSY, called the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [8]. This model predicts new particles, called sparticles, that are superpartners of each SM particle in the chiral multiplets, as shown in Fig. 1. A new quantum number, Rparity, is created and defined as P R = (\u22121) 2s+3B+L , where s is the spin, B the baryon number and L the lepton number. It is negative/positive for SUSY/SM particles. Therefore, the sparticles have the same quantum numbers as their SM  [8] partners, except for the spin which differs by half a unit, and R-parity. The spectrum is characterized by 25 elementary scalars and 10 elementary fermions without counting the SM particles.",

            "text": "In the MSSM framework, three main theoretical unknowns influence the search direction: the LSP nature, the compression (or not) of the SUSY spectra, and the status of R-parity. For the first one, experimental constraints restrict the LSP to be the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ) or the almost massless gravitino. In the latter case, the final states are increased compared to the former. The reason is that the Next-to-Lightest SUSY Particle (NLSP) which can be any of the SUSY particles (squark, gluino, slepton, chargino or neutralino) will Natural SUSY particle mass spectra giving less than 10 % tuning [13] decay to the gravitino and the SM partner of the NLSP [12]. 2 The second MSSM theory unknown is the difference (\u0394M) between the mass of the highest sparticle produced at the LHC (M SUSY ) and the LSP (M LSP ), resulting in compressed or open spectra, i.e. soft or hard objects in the final state. The third MSSM theory unknown is the status of R-parity. In a plain vanilla MSSM scenario R-parity is conserved (RPC), but it could well be violated (RPV) or even a continuous symmetry. It is important to mention that in the huge MSSM phase space long-lived particles decaying within the detector or even outside often exist. This situation could arise from the low mass difference between two sparticles in the spectrum, very weak coupling to the LSP, very small R-parity Yukawa couplings, etc. 2 The most 'natural' situation is that the NLSP is the \u03c7 0 1 (Fig. 3), whose decay will depend on its flavor (bino-, wino-or higgsino-like of Fig. 2) and results in \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3 G, \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3 /Z G or \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z/h 0 G decays, respectively. The relative proportion of \u03b3 , Z and h 0 depends also on other parameters \u03b8 W or tan \u03b2. Typical SUSY cross sections of pair-produced sparticles at the LHC are given in Fig. 4-for two different sparticles mass degeneracy is assumed. 3 Since each SM particle and its superpartner belong to the same multiplet, the sparticle decay generally involves the SM partner and the LSP. However, due to the high number of new particles many dif- Typical decay of a colored SUSY particle at LHC. The two cases shown at the bottom of the SUSY spectrum correspond to the two considered LSP types ferent decays are possible depending on the sparticle mass spectrum, generating long decay chains. Plain vanilla MSSM searches are therefore characterized by pair-produced particles, two LSPs escaping the detection and long decay chains involving jets and/or leptons and photons as depicted in Fig. 5. Note that for the gravitino LSP scenario, the mass difference with the NLSP is always sizeable in the natural spectrum, O(100) GeV, because the gravitino is almost massless. If the masses of all colored particles are too high to be produced at LHC, the production may be dominated by chargino-neutralino pair production, resulting in less complicated final states, generally containing several leptons. Finally, non-prompt sparticle decays can generate striking signatures as displayed in Fig. 6.",

First, every corner of the parameter space needs to be cov-ered, including all possible decay channels which provide a high number of final states with different mixtures of reconstructed objects (photon, electron, muon, tau, jets, b-jets, missing transverse energy). Second, due to the presence of many scalars and weakly interacting particles, cross sections are generally extremely tiny with respect to the SM background (cf. Fig. 4). In the plain vanilla MSSM scenario, the few signal events are generally located in the tails of the kinematic distributions, requiring challenging trigger, powerful discriminating variables and accurate background modeling in a complicated region of the phase space. In other SUSY scenarios where R-parity is violated and/or non-prompt decays are possible, the experimental challenge generally shifts to taking the best performance of each subdetector to improve secondary vertex reconstruction, timing resolution, jet substructure reconstruction, lepton coverage, etc. Therefore, SUSY searches provide an excellent way to push the detector and analyser capabilities to their best.",

The first proton-proton run of the LHC (Run 1) lasted from March 2010 to December 2012 with \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, and collisions every 50 ns. It was extremely successful and provided more than 20 fb \u22121 in 3 years, as shown in Fig. 7. Because of the increase of the proton density per bunch and the tuning of the beam optics, the number of interactions per beam crossing (pile-up) increased regularly during Run 1 to reach more than 30 at the end of 2012; see Fig. 8. This increases the complexity of the event reconstruction, as discussed later.

These processes can have cross sections that are up to ten orders of magnitude higher than the SUSY signal. Therefore, finding SUSY at the LHC requires to design signal regions (SR) by exploiting at best the main characteristics of the decay cascade: the presence of two stable LSPs, whose momentum is directly proportional to E miss T , and/or long decay chains involving jets, i.e. large calorimeter activity in the event. The latter is efficiently measured by the scalar sum, H T , of the transverse energy of reconstructed objects (for some analyses, only a part of the objects can also be considered). Rectangular cuts can then be applied on H T and E miss T (or H miss T ). Sensitivity can be improved by taking advantage of the correlation between H T and E miss T and by computing m eff = H T + E miss T , called the effective mass [31]. This is illustrated in Fig. 9. The other advantage is that m eff can be linked to characteristic SUSY parameters like M SUSY , the mass of the highest colored object, M LSP , the LSP mass, and their mass difference \u0394M; see Fig. 5. Typically m eff will Fig. 9 Illustration of the variables used in a standard SUSY search for strong production at LHC with one-lepton, three jets and E miss T final state [33]. For completeness the variable E miss T / \u221a H T is also represented in this plane peak at 1.8(M 2 SUSY \u2212 M 2 LSP )/M SUSY [32]. For open spectra (\u0394M = M SUSY \u2212 M LSP > O(500) GeV), this value is well above the SM background which has no correlation between E miss T and H T , and therefore peaks at lower values. However, for compressed spectra (\u0394M < 500 GeV), m eff loses its separation power and selection requirements have to be relaxed, or other discriminant variables have to be used.",

By grouping the reconstructed objects in two hemispheres, two mega-jets can be formed and kinematic properties used to distinguish signal from SM background. Two common variables are \u03b1 T [34], the ratio of the p T of the second hardest jet and the invariant mass formed from the two hardest jets, and Razor [35]. In the former case, SM dijet events are back-to-back and trail off at \u03b1 T = 0.5, whereas a SUSY signal can be asymmetric (causing \u03b1 T > 0.5) because of the presence of the LSP in the decay. For Razor, the idea is to use the transverse and longitudinal information to reconstruct the mass M R of the two mega-jets in the rest frame of the two-jet system (R-frame). For signal with open spectra M R will peak at M SUSY and at m t or m W for tt and WW events. Other quantities related to the R-frame (transverse mass, Lorentz boost) can be used to increase the discrimination against the background.",

The lepton generally comes from W leptonic decays originating from chargino, top or from slepton decay. Experimental challenges drastically change: lepton triggers can be exploited and requirements on jet kinematics can be reduced. Lowering cuts on E miss T and H T is possible since the multi-jet QCD background is naturally suppressed by the presence of iso-lated lepton(s). Very soft leptons (in the 6-25 GeV range) are also considered to probe the compressed gluino-chargino-LSP case [72]. Finally, other variables exist like the transverse mass m T , which efficiently reduces tt and W + jets backgrounds by requiring m T > m W , as discussed in Sect. 3.2. This allows one to compensate the loss due to the leptonic branching ratio(s) when comparing with lepton-veto analyses. While this works well for single-lepton analyses to be competitive with lepton-veto analyses, this is generally not sufficient when two leptons are considered. 7 In that case, it is more advantageous to consider two leptons of same-sign since this signature is almost not produced by SM processes and appears naturally in many SUSY decays. The two reasons are: (i) gluinos are Majorana particles and produced in pairs, therefore if leptons are present in each leg they have 50 % probability to be of same-sign, (ii) multi-W final states occur frequently through top and chargino decays and leptonic W decay will ensure the presence of two same-sign leptons in most cases. For a same-sign dilepton analysis, the main background is caused by the rare ttX (X = h 0 , Z, W) SM processes, fake leptons and mis-measured lepton charge because of the process l \u2192 l\u03b3 \u2192 lll where l inherits most of the energy of the original lepton.",

Reducing the dominant tt \u2192 W + W \u2212 bb background is possible when considering (i) a single isolated lepton and at least five jets, two or three of which are identified as b-tagged jets [73], (ii) two same-sign leptons with one, two or three b-tagged jets [74]. 8 The best sensitivity is obtained by the former, which can exclude gluino masses up to 1.3 TeV for LSP masses below 600 GeV, assuming a 100 % branching ratio for the decay g \u2192 t t \u2192 tt \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 1 .

However, it is already fair to say that the most important constraint from the LHC experiments is the exclusion of the gluino mass below 1 TeV for open spectra. This fairly generic limit excludes a great part of the favored region from naturalness (cf. Fig. 3). Since the gluino mass is governed by only one parameter (M 3 ) and enters in the top squark and EWKino masses through loop corrections, this has the general effect to pull up the whole natural spectrum [75]. Compressed spectra are still poorly explored, but more work is still going on to exploit monojet-like final states provided by ISR/FSR. Extra sensitivity will also be brought by analyses based on reduced lepton and jet thresholds-this is possible when the peak luminosity decreases at the end of a LHC run. Another important information is coming from the LSP mass constraint which can reach up to 600 GeV in leptonic analyses, though it is less generic than the gluino limit. Finally, squark-mass constraints are more model-dependent and single squark-mass limits are at most of the order of 500 GeV.",

Another motivation for the thirdgeneration squarks to be the lightest colored sparticles is that the squark mass eigenstates ( q 1 , q 2 ) depend on orthogonal combinations of the gauge eigenstates ( q R , q L ), e.g. for the lighter squark given by q 1 = q L cos(\u0398 q ) + q R sin(\u0398 q ). The off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix \u0398 q are proportional to the mass of the SM partner particle, the Higgs-related parameters \u03bc and tan \u03b2. Therefore, the mass of the t 1 , predominantly t R , can be small due to the large top quark mass, and the b 1 mass is expected to be light for large tan \u03b2.

But if the gluino masses are too heavy to be produced at the LHC energy, searches for direct third-generation squark pair production might be the only way to observe them, even though these branching ratios are more than one order of magnitude lower than those for gluino-gluino production (see Fig. 4). For top squarks, the possible decays and therewith connected search strategies depend on the masses of the accessible particles. Assuming that the t 1 , the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and the \u03c7 0 1 are the only accessible SUSY particles, the possible decays in the m t 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 parameter plane are displayed in Fig. 19. : here the top squark will decay either like t \u2192 t \u03c7 0 1 or t \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , where \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u03c7 0 1 , with cross sections depending on the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 mass. In both cases this gives two W bosons, resulting in a large probability to have (at least) one electron or muon in the final state. Hence, the searches requiring zero or one lepton in the final state are the strongest. Zero-lepton searches are expected to have a slightly higher reach in the t 1 mass for low \u03c7 0 1 masses, while one-lepton analyses tend to reach closer to the diagonal line at m t 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = m t . The region around this line is very difficult to cover with current searches, as the kinematics of the decay are similar to the SM top decay kinematics. An option to test this parameter space exists for cases where the t 2 is not too heavy either. A decay chain to search for would be t 2 \u2192 Z t 1 .

Accordingly, a 100 % left-handed top would reduce the limit by the same amount. Also, one has to take into account that the simplified model assumes a probably too optimistic branching fraction of 100 %.

Further discriminating variables are the minimum angle \u0394\u03c6 between the E miss T vector and either of the three highest-p T jets, which is expected to be larger for signal than for background from multi-jet events, and a requirement on the contransverse mass m CT (cf.

From naturalness arguments O(1 TeV) slepton masses are expected: the very low slepton production cross section, see Fig. 4, will therefore prevent their discovery. However, searching for O(500 GeV) sleptons could be achievable with high luminosity. The reason is that these very low cross sections with respect to EWKino production, are largely recovered by the more favorable branching ratio BR( l + \u2192 l + \u03c7 0 1 ) = 100 % compared to leptonic branching ratios of W and Z. Lepton searches rely almost entirely on the very powerful discriminant variables like m T2 or m CT and electron(s) or muon(s) in the final states (presently no sensitivity is obtained for staus).

In RPV SUSY, single sneutrinos can be produced via \u03bb 311 coupling and then decay through \u03bb i jk couplings to lepton pairs of different flavor. Searches for such scenarios have been performed in all possible combinations of differentflavor dilepton selections [99]. An example for a possible signal that is compatible with current exclusion limits on the strength of the RPV interactions from precision low-energy experiments [100], expectation, is given in Fig. 31 for the e\u03bc channel. Sneutrino masses of up to 1.6 TeV are excluded in the e\u03bc selection (for \u03bb 311 = 0.11 and \u03bb 132 = 0.07), where the mass resolution is better than in the channels including hadronically decaying tau leptons.

SUSY models with \u03c7 0 1 LSP and very small RPV couplings can provide a plethora of possibilities: with leptons (electrons, muons or taus) attached to the displaced vertex or without leptons. While the latter case requires tracker and calorimeter information (cluster size, track multiplicity pointing to the cluster, etc.), the former relies on a dedicated tracking algorithm for non-standard displaced-vertex reconstruction. To date the only publicly available search interpreted in SUSY models is the one from ATLAS [118]. SUSY models with the simplified decay chain q/ g \u2192 q/qq + \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 q/qq + \u03bcq i q j are excluded for \u03c7 0 1 lifetimes below 1 m and squark (gluino) masses below 0.7 (0.9) TeV. Other searches looking for long-lived neutral bosons decaying in two leptons [119] could be useful to reject some SUSY models-though it is not yet done. In this case the displaced vertex is required to be at a distance of more than five standard deviations from the primary vertex in the transverse plane. Similar study is ongoing with two jets.

Non-colored particles can also be detector-stable and behave like heavy muons. Therefore, the analysis techniques are similar to the ones used for colored particles. However, in that case, the best performing signal regions are the ones requiring two detector-stable slepton candidates. The current mass limits from detector-stable particles are presented in Fig. 38 [125]-note that the ATLAS results are still those from the 7 TeV run [30]. Because no Standard Model backgrounds exist, the limits obtained are generally higher than in the prompt-decay case. This is especially true for top and bottom squarks and staus-where no limits on the direct production exist in the RPC prompt case.

The extra Higgs are searched for as a peak around 10 GeV in the invariant di-muon mass [129]. The naturalness constraints from the 126 GeV Higgs mass are relaxed and singlino-like LSPs with very small couplings are possible-changing the phenomenology of the SUSY EW sector. Because of this addition, these models predict final states with multi-leptons and E miss T . Even if no dedicated searches exist yet at LHC, reinterpretations of present EWKino searches, presented in Sect. 6, have already started to constrain NMSSM models [130]. Apart from NMSSM,  [127] another popular model is stealth SUSY [131], where the invisible singlet and singlino are mass degenerate and light, which reduces drastically the amount of E miss T -all SUSY cascade decays end like S \u2192 S(\u2192 jj) G with a poorly boosted G. Experimental signatures comprise a low E miss T , displaced vertex and high-multiplicity final states including photons and a high number of b-jets. CMS already places a limit on stealth scenarios where S decays via a photon [132]. Limits of 1.5 TeV on squarks initiating cascade decays are obtained. More refined searches are currently going on.",

For the two first models, a new particle (the sgluon) completes the MSSM multiplet composed of gluons and gluinos. In all models, the constraint on the gluino mass in the natural spectrum is relaxed since the radiative corrections are truncated. Because of that, gluino-gluino cross sections are expected to be lower than in the MSSM, weakening the current constraint. The sgluon provides also new signatures to search for. Above a mass of 350 GeV, sgluons dominantly decay in two tops. They can for example be searched for by asking two same-sign leptons (no public results are presently available). At lower mass, sgluons decay in two gluons, giving a pair of two-jet resonances with equal mass. A unique pairing of the four highest energetic jets is achieved for each event by minimizing the pairwise separation. A peak in the dijet mass distribution is then searched for, while the shape and the normalization of the multi-jet background are esti- Fig. 41 Exclusion limits at 95 % CL on the sgluon pair production cross section as a function of the sgluon mass [136] mated by a data-driven method. Sgluons are excluded for masses below 300 GeV; see Fig. 41  [136]. It is interesting to note that this signature, unique in BSM models at LHC, is limited at low mass by the multi-jet energy trigger threshold and therefore strong limits are already obtained with the first run at 7 TeV in 2010.",

Expected luminosities are \u223c100 fb \u22121 at the end of 2017 and \u223c300 fb \u22121 in 2022. A possible extension, called High-Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC), is planned from 2024 to 2030-2035 (Run 3) and could deliver ultimately \u223c3000 fb \u22121 . The average number of pileup events per bunch crossing is expected to rise up to 140 in 2030. Expected discovery sensitivities and exclusion limits have recently been extracted by ATLAS and CMS for benchmark processes of plain vanilla MSSM, i.e. R-parity conservation and \u03c7 0 1 LSP [137,138]. With the increase in beam energy in 2015, the strong SUSY cross sections are greatly enhanced, opening a new phase space to explore with already a low integrated luminosity recorded (1-10 fb \u22121 ). A few examples are given here for sparticles at the energy frontier. The cross section for gluinogluino production (with squarks decoupled) is enhanced by more than a factor of 20 for gluino masses of around 1.3 TeV. The cross section for the pair production of squarks of the first/second generation as well as for third-generation squarks rises by about a factor of 10 for squark masses of 800 GeV. With 300 fb \u22121 , mass degenerate squarks (of the first and second generation) and gluinos of up to 2.7 TeV could be discovered with 5\u03c3 significance. For higher gluino (squarks) masses, e.g. 3.5 TeV, squark (gluino) masses could be discovered up to 2.5 (2) TeV. With the HL-LHC, a gain of about 300 GeV in the mass range is expected. Finally, the top squark could be discovered up to masses of about 800 (1000) GeV with 300 (3000) fb \u22121 , assuming a 100 % branching ratio to a top quark and a \u03c7 0 1 . Searches for electroweak particles like neutralinos and charginos benefit more from the large expected integrated luminosity than for the increase in \u221a s due to their low cross sections. By the end of Run 3, neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 2 ) and charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) decaying to Z \u03c7 0 1 and W \u03c7 0 1 , respectively, as in scenario (a) of Fig. 2, can be discovered up to a mass of 700 GeV for \u03c7 0 1 masses of up to 200 GeV with a 5\u03c3 significance. In the case of no signal, the exclusion limits are about 200 to 300 GeV higher. Some sensitivity is also expected in the compressed and more natural scenario (c) of Fig. 2 where the \u03c7 0 1 is higgsino-like. In summary, the full harvest of the LHC, including the HL-LHC, could explore the largest part of the most interesting weak-scale SUSY phase space, which will remain a hot topic to be tested for at least the next two decades.",

However, this model also predicts new particles at the energy frontier that could solve the gauge hierarchy problem of the Standard Model, i.e. the quadratic divergence of the Higgs mass at higher energy. Assuming that R-parity is conserved, the plain vanilla SUSY solution predicts a 'natural' or low fine-tuning mass spectrum composed of gluino masses around 1 TeV, top squark and left-handed bottom squark masses around 500 GeV, and chargino/neutralino masses below 500 GeV. All other SUSY particles could be of much higher mass. In this framework, the two favored LSP candidates could be the lightest neutralino or the gravitino. ATLAS and CMS experiment have probed, by direct searches, the uncharted heart of the MSSM spectrum, attracting high attention from the community. To date, these dedicated searches, mainly based on the presence of multi-jets and E miss T (but not only these), have not revealed any sign of new physics. Not all results from Run 1 are currently available but the following general conclusions could be drawn: the gluino mass, governed by only one SUSY parameter, M 3 , could be excluded below 1 TeV irrespective of the SUSY mass spectrum in between the gluino and the LSP, and the nature of the LSP. This conclusion applies well for open SUSY spectra, i.e. a mass difference between gluino and the LSP above O(500 GeV). But the excluded gluino mass region should be lowered to 600 GeV when considering more and more compressed spectra, because the jet and E miss T softening decreases the acceptance-the presence of isolated lepton(s) can partially correct for that.",

A strong focus was put on the third squark generation (top and bottom squark) because of their particular position in the natural spectrum. When top and bottom squarks are directly produced, final states are generally less complex than for the gluino and squarks of the first and second generation and composed of multiple b-jets and lepton(s). Dedicated searches dramatically shrink the allowed window, but they are (presently) unsuccessful. As an illustration, holes in the top squark searches are presently located near the top mass funnel, m t = m t + m \u03c7 0 1 , for m \u03c7 0 1 >100 GeV, at low mass difference between top squark and \u03c7 0 1 or in very intricate top squark decay chains. The weak SUSY sector (charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons) is also probed extensively at LHC. Because of the lower cross section, the Standard Model background is only reducible considering multi-lepton final states. These leptons are provided by the leptonic decay of the W, Z, Higgs and/or sleptons. Compared with the other sectors no strong general conclusions are drawn (yet) because of the high number of possible final states and the complexity of the sector governed by around 10 parameters. Nonetheless, constraints are generally always going beyond the LEP ones, and biting the natural spectrum in many cases.",

More definitive conclusions will come when all these results will be interpreted with a full scan of the main 19-20 MSSM parameters (some assumptions are made on the other 105-19 parameters), which will happen in 2014. Meanwhile, more focus has been put on searches for longlived particles, R-parity violating scenarios and new theoretical ideas (Stealth SUSY, Dirac gauginos, extra gauge-singlet superfield) that provide many striking signatures, generally background free and relying more on detector performance. Such scenarios are in most cases compatible with the absence of experimental evidence for plain vanilla MSSM. A huge number of possibilities exist and the most important ones have been covered (or are worked on), with presently no sign of SUSY. It is interesting to note that the gluino mass is constrained to be above 1 TeV in the models that have been considered.",

At LHC, the main improvement comes from the measurement of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 branching ratio, where the leading SUSY contributions involve SUSY Higgses (A 0 and H 0 ) in penguin diagrams. Good agreement with the Standard Model was found [139,140], and no irreducible limit exists on SUSY models. Other indirect evidence for new physics could be found when searching for the flavorchanging decay of the top quark like t \u2192 cH, which is very strongly suppressed in the Standard Model BR = O(10 \u221215 ). Contributions from SUSY Higgses in virtual loops of the decay amplitude can enhance the cross section significantly, by factors up to nine orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, up to now, no evidence for this decay has been found when considering H \u2192 WW, ZZ, \u03c4 \u03c4 leptonic decay [69] and H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay [141].",
