            "text": "The proton is a building block of matter, which is itself built from elementary quarks and gluons. Our understanding of the structure of the proton has become increasingly sophisticated since the advent of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and a reason for this has been the quest to understand how the proton gets its intrinsic spin from its constituents. The present view is that quark or gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) makes important contributions to the proton spin [1]. Early indications of this came from large analyzing powers (A N ), also known as transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSA), measured in the production of charged and neutral pions in collisions of transversely polarized protons at center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 20 GeV [2]. The observable A N is the amplitude of the spin-correlated azimuthal modulation of the produced particles. A large A N is not expected for pions produced with sufficient transverse momentum (p T ) in collinear perturbative QCD (pQCD) at leading twist, due to the chiral properties of the theory [3]. Measurements of large A N for pion production at large Feynman-x (x F = 2p z / \u221a s, where p z is the pion longitudinal momentum in the center-of-mass frame) prompted theorists to introduce spin-correlated transverse momentum (k T ) in either the initial state (Sivers effect [4]) or the final state (Collins effect [5]). For inclusive pion production, these effects cannot be disentangled. In contrast, in measurements of jets, defined as a collimated multiplicity of energetic baryons and mesons that are produced in high-energy collisions, contributions to A N from final-state fragmentation are absent and hence information about the scattered quark or gluon can be inferred directly. In particular, A N for jet production, direct photons, or Drell-Yan processes is expected to arise only from the Sivers effect. The initial-state spin-correlated k T is related by models [6] to quark and gluon OAM.",

            "text": "Cross sections for pion production at large x F in p \u2191 + p collisions at \u221a s \u2264 20 GeV [2,7] are much larger than naive pQCD expectations. This resulted in skepticism that pion production in these kinematics is from hard-scattering processes. Theoretical interest in understanding A N for pion production has been revived by recent measurements [8,9] at \u221a s \u2265 62 GeV, where cross sections [10] are in agreement with pQCD. Furthermore, measurements of A N for pion production in p \u2191 + p collisions at \u221a s \u2265 62 GeV have been concurrent with measurements of transverse SSA in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) [11] where an electron or muon is inelastically scattered from a proton, whose spin is transverse to the lepton beam. Meson fragments of the struck quark are found to have spin-correlated azimuthal modulations, whose amplitudes are understood by the Sivers and Collins effects, intro-duced to explain A N for p \u2191 + p \u2192 \u03c0 + X. An alternative and complementary theoretical approach based on collinear factorization [12] predicts A N involving twist-3 multi-parton correlations [13], and is expected to be related to the Sivers and Collins functions via transverse-momentum moments. However, an attempt at linking the different approaches using data from SIDIS and p \u2191 +p \u2192 \u03c0+X yielded a mismatch in the sign [14]. Most recently, theory has proposed that transverse SSA in p \u2191 +p receive large contributions from fragmentation [15]. Thus a consistent understanding of all transverse SSA in hard scattering processes is not yet within our grasp, but would greatly benefit from measurements of A N for jet production in p \u2191 + p collisions, since it receives no contributions from spin-dependent fragmentation effects.",

The primary detector components were two mirror-symmetric hadron calorimeter (HCal) modules that were mounted to face the \"Blue\" beam (the \"Yellow\" beam travels in the opposite direction) for the 2011 and 2012 RHIC runs. The HCal spanned the pseudorapidity interval 2.4 < \u03b7 < 4.0, a region that is well shielded from single beam backgrounds by the cryostats of the ring magnets. A top view of the A N DY apparatus in the 2011 run is shown in Fig. 1.

An automated procedure for bringing A N DY into collisions was developed, and as it was repeatedly demonstrated, it can be done without significant impact on the beam lifetime and luminosities at other interaction points. The colliding beam luminosity at IP2 was measured by the vernier scan technique and resulted in \u03c3=0.94\u00b10.08 mb for the effective cross section of coincidences between the ZDC modules which were used to continuously monitor the luminosity.

Offline analysis also refined the relative calibration of all cells by a combination of \u03c0 0 reconstruction and the matching of energy deposition distributions from single cells between data and full simulation. For the jet analyses described below, the energy calibration was adjusted to account for the average difference between hadronic and EM showers from full simulation. We used E = 1.12 \u00d7 E \u2032 \u2212 0.1 GeV, where E is the equivalent incident energy measured by individual cells as used in the jet finders and E \u2032 is from \u03c0 0 calibration. The rescaling of the energy calibration from neutral pion finding to set the jet-energy scale is further discussed below. An additional check of the calorimeter hadronic response can be done from reconstruction of known mesons or baryons. Evidence for \u03c1 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u2206 \u2192 N\u03c0 was observed in the data, but they were not used for calibration because of their large widths.

Low mass baryons and mesons built from strange quarks (\u039b, K S ) are observed as well. Their utility for calibration is impacted by their proximity to the sum of daughter masses and by their weak decays, resulting in large decay lengths, because nearly all particles are produced with large Lorentz factor in the forward direction. The K 0 * is the natural choice to check hadronic corrections to the calibration; since it has small width, it undergoes strong decay meaning there is no displaced vertex, it is sufficiently more massive than its daughters, and it is prolifically produced in the forward direction. The K 0 * decays with nearly 100% branching ratio to K\u03c0.",

The data is well described by our full simulation, although there are some indications that jets produced by PYTHIA 6.222 [20] have energy concentrated closer to the thrust axis relative to our measurements. Also shown in Fig. 5 is the correlation between x F and p T for the jet events. The d\u03b7 requirement strongly correlates these two kinematic variables. The jet energy scale was established by comparing tower jets reconstructed from the full simulation to particle jets reconstructed from PYTHIA, and resulted in the hadronic compensation described earlier. A check of the energy scale was made for 3-jet events in the data by observation of a narrow structure in 3-jet mass distribution attributed to the 3-gluon decay of \u03a5(1S) [24]. Fig. 6 shows the 3-jet mass distribution compared to the simulated \u03a5(1S)\u2192 3g. The peak has statistical signifi-  cance of 3.5\u03c3. The centroid of the peak depends smoothly on R jet used in the anti-k T algorithm, as do our measures of the jet energy scale from simulation. The mass peak is narrow because it comes from the jets that consist primarily of photons, electrons, and positrons, as deduced from the simulation. The uncertainty of the jet energy scale is constrained by the variation of the mass peak centroid (\u00b5) scaled by the known mass (M \u03a5(1S) [26]) with S , as shown in the inset to Fig. 6.

The cross section is averaged over the acceptance, resulting in \u03b7 jet =3.31. Both theoretical calculations provide a fair description of the cross section, supporting the conclusion that forward jets originate from hard scattering. The error bands for the calculations reflect the scale dependence, with the upper limit of each band using scale \u00b5 = p T /2 and the lower limit using \u00b5 = 2p T . The scale dependence of the GPM calculations is larger than for NLO pQCD, likely reflecting that the GPM is a leading-order calculation, albeit with parton distribution functions that depend on transverse momentum that are constrained to fit unpolarized SIDIS data with factorization assumed. Our results are also compared to PYTHIA 6.222 [20] and 6.425 [28] predictions for anti-k T jets reconstructed from stable particles that are within the detector acceptance. In Ref. [23] it was shown that PYTHIA 6.222 predicts that forward jets arise from partonic hard scattering. Analysis of particle jets generated by PYTHIA 6.222 show that the forward jet x F is strongly correlated with the Bjorken-x of the parton (most likely a valence quark) from the proton with p z > 0. The Bjorken-x distributions in bins of x F can be described by Gaussian functions with \u03c3=0.06 at x F =0.2 increasing to \u03c3=0.09 at x F =0.4. There is no correlation between jet x F and the Bjorken-x of the parton from the other proton, resulting in a broad distribution of parton x values that extends , as is expected for forward particle production. The low-x part of that distribution can be accessed by detecting forward dijets. PYTHIA 6.222 precedes tunings based on Tevatron data which resulted in later versions (e.g., 6.425) used by the LHC. Versions of PYTHIA that predate tunings for the LHC are known to accurately describe large x F \u03c0 0 production [29], and are known to lose accuracy for more complicated multiparticle correlations [30]. The forward jet A N is measured by the cross-ratio method from yields in the nominally mirror symmetric beam-left and beam-right HCal modules, sorted by the polarization direction of the Blue beam heading towards the detector and averaged over the polarization direction of the opposite beam (Yellow) for positive x F (and vice versa for negative x F ):",

A specific crossing of bunches from the two rings is the remainder after dividing the RHIC clock count for an event by 120. The bunch-crossing distribution has characteristic holes that correspond to missing bunches from one or the other beam. The pattern of polarization directions for that fill recorded at A N DY originating from information broadcast by RHIC is then used to accumulate N \u2191(\u2193) L(R) in the analysis.

Non-zero A N for forward jets is expected for the Sivers effect, but not for spin-dependent fragmentation effects because the jet finding integrates over the pro-duced hadrons. The measured jet A N at x F > 0 is small and positive. There is a hint of a negative A N at x F < 0. One check for systematic effects was to fit the spin asymmetry (\u01eb = P beam A N ) measured in each jet x F bin for each RHIC fill by a constant. The resulting \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom from these fits is close to unity, and is consistent with the statistical uncertainties, meaning the systematic uncertainties are small. A more quantitative check for systematic effects was to establish if an effectively unpolarized sample of p + p collisions had A N consistent with zero. This was accomplished by a random reversal of the spin direction for half of the filled bunch crossings. The mean value of \u01eb for \u223c 100 random spin direction patterns had values 10 \u22125 < \u01eb < 10 \u22124 resulting in the systematic uncertainty estimate of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for the jet A N . The systematic uncertainties of A N are estimated by varying the jet finder and valid jet parameters. Our jet A N measurement is limited by statistics. The measured small and positive jet A N is naively expected because A N (\u03c0 + )\u2248 \u2212 A N (\u03c0 \u2212 ), thus giving cancelling contributions from \u03c0 \u00b1 in a jet.",

Both the GPM and the twist-3 pQCD calculations fit the Sivers function to transverse single-spin asymmetries from SIDIS. It is important to recognize that the Bjorken-x range of the SIDIS data has little kinematic overlap with either forward jet data or forward pion data [8]. Unlike the case for pion production, both the GPM and the twist-3 pQCD calculation agree that the forward jet A N should be small and positive. Their phenomenological extractions of the Sivers function from SIDIS are compatible with the sign and magnitude of A N in p \u2191 p \u2192 jet + X. Neither calculation considers negative x F jet production. Other theoretical work [34,35] involving tri-gluon correlators and low-x phenomena address transverse single spin effects at negative x F . A future measurement that improves the precision of these measurements is required to compare to theory for possible spin effects at negative x F .",
