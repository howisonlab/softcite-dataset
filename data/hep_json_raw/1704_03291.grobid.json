To this end, a series of heavy ion collision measurements are performed. It is believed that above a certain collision energy and system size a phase transition between the hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma occurs. A number of observables have been developed to determine which of the phases was created at the early stage of the collision. This report discusses the dependence of the ratio of the mean number of produced pions to the mean number of wounded nucleons on the Fermi energy measure. For comparison with other measurements this is often presented in the form of the \"kink\" plot. This plot is presented enriched with preliminary results for 40 Ar+ 45 Sc central collisions at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A and 150A GeV/c beam momenta. The results are finally compared to data from other experiments.",

Search for the onset of deconfinement of a strongly interacting matter is part of the physics program of the experiment. Within the framework of this program measurements of p+p, Be+Be, p+Pb, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions were performed. In the near future, measurements of Xe+La reactions are planned. The measurements will greatly benefit the two-dimensional system size and collision energy scan, which will be helpful in studying the phase transition between hadronic and deconfined phases.",

Upstream from the spectrometer are placed scintillators, Cherenkov detectors and beam position detectors. They provide timing references and position measurements for incoming beam particles. About four meters after the target, the trigger scintillator counter S4 detects if collisions are in the target area by the absence of a beam particle signal. The main detectors of NA61/SHINE are four large volume time projection chambers (TPCs) used for the determination of trajectories and the energy loss dE/dx of produced charged particles. The first two -VTPC-1 and VTPC-2 -are placed in a magnetic field to measure the particle charge and momentum. Two large TPCs (MTPC-L and MTPC-R) are placed downstream of the magnets. Time-of-flight (ToF) measurements are performed by two ToF walls (ToF-L, ToF-R). The last part of the setup is the projectile spectator detector (PSD) -a zero-degree calorimeter which measures the energy of projectile spectators.",

Interactions between them are described by quantum chromodynamics [2,3]. One of the most important properties of quarks and gluons is that in the matter under normal conditions they are always enclosed within hadrons. This is called the quark confinement. In order to transform the matter from the hadronic into the deconfined phase one needs to create a system with high temperature and system density conditions. This can be achieved experimentally in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The system that achieves necessary conditions during the early stage of the collision forms the quark-gluon plasma [4], which rapidly expands and freezesout. In this later stage of the collision, quarks and gluons recombine and form a new set of hadrons.",

The majority of particles (~90%) produced in heavy ion collisions are \u03c0 mesons. Therefore, the entropy and information regarding the state of the matter formed in the early stage of collision should be reflected in the number of produced pions normalized to the volume of the system. This intuitive argument was quantified within the Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [5]. The change of the mean number of produced pions \u2329\u03c0\u232a is often normalized to the number of wounded nucleons \u2329W\u232a [6] and plotted against the Fermi energy measure",

The generated data undergo a regular reconstruction procedure. Selecting of negatively charged pions results in the distribution n i,j s el . The correction factor c i,j is then calculated as the ratio of the two Monte Carlo generated spectra, c i,j = n i,j gen /n i,j s el .

This allows one to produce a preliminary version of the \"kink\" plot shown in Fig. 5. From the preliminary version of the \"kink\" plot one can conclude that for high SPS energies Ar+Sc measurements lie in the Pb+Pb region. On the other hand, for low SPS energies Ar+Sc measurements lie in the p+p region. This intermediate collision system does not behave as a lighter system or as a heavier one. For lower SPS energies the pion production is enhanced compared to heavier systems, whereas for high SPS energies it is enhanced com- matter or the percolation threshold [11]. A further investigation of the preliminary results and improved centrality selection is urgently needed.",
