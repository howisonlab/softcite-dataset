            "text": "The magnetic dipole moment (MDM) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) are static properties of particles that determine the spin motion in an external electromagnetic field, as described by the T-BMT equation [1][2][3]. Several measurements of baryon MDMs contributed to confirm the validity of the quark model [4]. Measurements of the MDM of heavy baryons, i.e. baryons containing charm or beauty quarks, have never been performed due to the difficulties imposed by the short lifetime of these particles of about 10 \u221213 \u221210 \u221212 s. These measurements would provide important anchor points for QCD calculations, helping to discriminate between different models [5,6], and would improve the current understanding of the internal structure of hadrons. The possibility to measure the MDM of positively-charged charm baryons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using bent crystals has been proposed in Refs. [7,8] and recently revisited [9,10].",

Similarly to the MDM case, the method relies on baryons produced by the interaction of 7 TeV protons, extracted from the LHC beam, on a fixed target. The baryons are subsequently channeled in a bent crystal. The spin precession of short-lived particles is induced by the intense electromagnetic field between the crystal atomic planes. The EDM and the MDM information can be extracted by measuring the spin polarization of the channeled baryons the end of the bent crystal. This technique can be extended to strange and beauty positively-charged baryons.",

In Sects. 2 and 4, after introducing the channeling of charged particles in bent crystals, we study the deflection and the spin precession of positively-and negatively-charged baryons in a bent crystal using Geant4 simulations. We assess the experimental technique and study the possibility to extend the EDM searches and MDM measurements to negatively-charged baryons. This would allow to perform tests of the CP T symmetry by measuring the MDM of particles and antiparticles. In Sect. 3 we prove that the spin evolution equations describing MDM and EDM effects hold for non-harmonic planar channel potential, therefore spin precession effects for both positively-and negatively-charged particles depend uniquely on the crystal curvature. In fact, the same equations also apply for axialchanneled particles, mostly relevant for negatively-charged particles, although its application to MDM and EDM physics will require further investigation. Section 5 focuses on the description of a possible fixed-target setup installed in front of the LHCb detector. The feasibility of the measurements has been evaluated relying on both parametric and Geant4 simulations along with a geometrical model of the detector. Baryons and antibaryons will be referred hereafter generically as baryons, unless otherwise stated.",

Positive particles in channeling condition are repelled by the atomic electric field and follow trajectories that tend to be far from the lattice sites. Negative particles, on the contrary, are attracted by the same field and can repeatedly oscillate across the nuclei of the crystal. For this reason negative particles are more likely to collide with the nuclei of the crystal lattice and therefore can easily escape from a channeling bound state. The average length that a channeled particle traverses before exiting from the planar or axial potential well is called dechanneling length L d , being much shorter for negative than for positive charges.",

Indeed, in the case of axial channeling, there are particles which are above the electric field barrier and are not trapped along a single atomic string. Those particles are anyway deflected due to their stochastic scattering with different atomic strings of the crystal, avoiding the fast dechanneling occurring for negative particles. However, reaching a condition of axial alignment for beam steering is relatively more difficult than for planar channeling since the orientation of the crystal with respect to two (and not only one) rotational axes must be found.",

Dynecharm++ allows the tracking of a relativistic charged particle inside a crystalline medium via the numerical integration of the T-BMT classical equations of motion [1][2][3]. The continuum potential approximation proposed by Lindhard is used [18]. Echarm allows the computation if the electrical characteristics of the crystal is within this approximation.",

The Geant4 physics lists used were the G4HadronElasticPhysics and the G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT and a custom G4EmStandardPhysics_option4 with single scattering instead of multiple-scattering. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the channeling efficiency for protons and antiprotons with the particle momentum for a 1 mm, 1 cm, 7 cm long Si crystal bent along the (110) plane by a 0.1, 1 and 14 mrad bending angle, respectively. The efficiency for positive particles is not spoiled by L d , being L d > 13 cm for all the momenta, but the Fig. 1 Dependence of the channeling efficiency of protons and antiprotons with the particle momentum for 1 mm, 1 cm and 7 cm long Si crystals bent along the (110) plane by a 0.1, 1 and 14 mrad bending angle, respectively. The curves for the anti-proton interacting with the 1 and 7 cm long Si crystals are superimposed unfavourable ratio between the critical radius R c and the bending radius is causing it to decrease. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 2, this ratio rapidly increases, lowering the deflection efficiency. For negative particles, the deflection efficiency is largely dominated by the crystal length. Therefore, the efficiency remains always lower than for positive particles for all the momenta. Such simulations show that the crystal geometric parameters have to be carefully chosen depending on the energy range in which the crystal has to be operated. In the figure, particles which are not captured under channeling at the crystal entrance are reflected to the opposite side with an angle which depends on the particle momentum [51].",

The spin precession in the yz and xy plane are induced by the MDM and the EDM, respectively.

The \u03a6 angle indicates the spin precession due to the MDM units) as \u03bc = J g\u03bc B s and \u03b4 = J d\u03bc B s, respectively, where \u03bc B = eh/(2mc) is the particle magneton. 1 The lifetime of baryons with heavy quark constituents is too short, e.g. the \u039b + c baryon lifetime is about 10 \u221213 s, for a standard magnet to induce any detectable effect to the spinpolarization vector before they decay. The possibility to measure the MDM of short-lived baryons using channeling in bent crystals was firstly pointed out by V. G. Baryshevsky in 1979. The method is based on the interaction of the MDM of the channeled particles with the intense electric field between crystal atomic planes. As an example, a sketch of the deflection of the \u039b + c baryon trajectory and spin precession in a bent crystal is shown in Fig. 3. Charm baryons produced by interaction of protons on a fixed target, e.g. a W target, are polarized perpendicularly to the production plane due to parity conservation in strong interactions. The production plane xz, also shown in the figure, is determined by the proton and baryon momenta; the latter defines the z axis. The initial polarization vector s 0 = (0, s 0 , 0) is perpendicular to the production plane, along the y axis, and at the end of the crystal it is rotated of an angle \u03a6. The crystal is bent in the yz plane by an angle \u03b8 C . The measurement of the MDM of charm baryons using bent crystals has been widely discussed since the 80's [52][53][54]. Lately, the possibility of the measurement at LHC energies has been considered [7][8][9]. Recently, the search for charm baryon EDM using bent crystals at LHC has been proposed [17].",

In case of axial alignment, spin rotation can also be investigated. The phenomenon of axial channeling has been observed for positive and negative particles but it has not been considered for spin precession to date. Here we discuss the possibility to induce spin precession in axialchanneled particles for potential applications in MDM and EDM measurements of charged baryons.

Similar crystals were used for the E761 experiment at FNAL [55] The same Geant4 toolkit can also be used to simulate the spin precession of other positive and negative particles in a bent crystal, to compare with the expected analytical values. For this purpose, a 1 cm long Si crystal bent along the (110) plane by a 1 mrad bending angle has been used. A beam of short-lived particles with no angular divergence is generated in the simulation immediately before the crystal and the precession angle at the end of the crystal is evaluated.

At this position, a minimal crystal bending angle of about 14 mrad is required for channeled baryons to be deflected inside the detector fiducial volume.

Such detector could also extend the angular coverage at larger pseudorapidity to minimise the crystal bending angle, increasing the channeling efficiency, and operate closer to the fixed-target to provide enhanced vertex resolution. Nevertheless, a minimal bending angle of about 5 mrad is needed to guarantee a good separation between channeled and unchanneled particles. This value can be inferred from the angular distribution of \u039b + c baryons produced by 7 TeV protons impinging on the fixed-target, which are highly collimated along the incident proton beam direction, and are isotropically distributed over the azimuthal angle. The polar angle that defines the emission cone is \u221d \u03b3 \u22121 \u2248 1 mrad.

In the following, the length L and bending angle \u03b8 C for Si and Ge crystals are estimated maximizing the sensitivity of the experiment to the electromagnetic moments, while taking into account detector acceptance. The optimization has been performed using fixed-target \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + events, produced in 7 TeV proton beam collisions on protons at rest using Pythia. The \u039b + c channeling has been simulated using a parameterisation based on current theoretical description and channeling measurements, following Ref. [19]. A particle entering the crystal is channeled when its polar angle \u03b8 y lies within the (\u2212\u03b8 L , \u03b8 L ) interval, where \u03b8 L is the Lindhard angle, introduced in Sect. 2. For p \u2248 1 TeV in Si (Ge) this angle is about 6 (7) \u00b5rad, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the angular divergence of \u039b + c baryons shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, the trapping efficiency \u03b5 t is largely dominated by the angular opening of the baryons produced in the target. This imposes the crystal to be directly attached to the W target. The per-event deflection efficiency is parameterised as",

The per-event critical radius, R c = pc/U (x c ), must be below the crystal curvature radius R = L/\u03b8 C , where U (x c ) is the interplanar electric field at the critical transverse coordinate, below which the particle is lost from channeling mode. For Si 110 (Ge 110), x c \u2248 0.885 (0.915) \u00c5 and U (x c ) \u2248 5.7 (10) GeV/ cm [19]. A scan in the (L , \u03b8 C ) plane is performed to determine the minimal error on the d and g factors separately. Since there is a wide momentum distribution for the channeled \u039b + c baryons, we generate and fit pseudo-experiments using a conditional probability density function constructed with the angular distribution in Eq. (26). Following the discussion at the end of Sec. 5.1, we require the momentum of the \u039b + c baryons to be higher than 800 GeV/c. The dependence of the spin polarization is obtained from Eqs. (7) and 8   shows regions whose uncertainties on d (g) are increased by 20% with respect to the minimum, for Si and Ge in both S1 and S2 scenarios. The gyromagnetic ratio prefers higher L values, as \u03c3 g \u221d 1/\u03b3 . These wide regions provide the optimal parameters summarized in Table 2, chosen around the minimum of the gyroelectric factor. The parametric approach adopted above to account for dechanneling losses has been validated with Geant4 simulations, discussed in Sects. 2 and 4, using 1 TeV\u039b + c baryons with no angular divergence. For a 7 (5) cm long Si (Ge) crystal bent along the (110) plane by a 14 (15) mrad bending angle, the channeling deflection efficiency \u03b5 c is found to be 37.8 \u00b1 0.6 (31.7 \u00b1 0.6)%. In this case the ratio of the optimal crystal bending radius to the critical bending radius, R/R c , is 2.85 (3.33) for the Si (Ge) crystal. The enhanced channeling efficiency of Ge compared to Si is experimentally demonstrated [67][68][69], and it explains the possibility for Ge to use shorter crystals with larger bending angles.",

The average number of primary interactions can be determined as \u03bd = F p/ f , where p is the probability for a proton to interact in the target material, F the rate of impinging protons, and f the LHC bunch collision frequency, f = 11245 Hz \u00d7 2400 = 27 MHz assuming 2400 bunches. The probability p can be estimated itself as p = 1\u2212e \u2212T /\u03bb , where T is the thickness of the target material and \u03bb its nuclear interaction length. For the W target, T = 0.5 cm and \u03bb = 9.95 cm results in p = 0.05, which in turn gives \u03bd = 0.91 for a flux F = 5 \u00d7 10 8 protons/s. Similarly, for the Si (Ge) crystal with T = L as given in Table 2 and using \u03bb = 46.52 (26.86) cm we obtain \u03bd = 2.59 (3.15). Summing together the W and Si (Ge) contributions gives \u03bd = 3.49 (4.05). Similar results are obtained evaluating the number of primary interactions as \u03bd = F N A \u03c3 pp \u03c1T A part /A T , where N A is the Avogadro number, \u03c1 the target density, A T the atomic mass, \u03c3 pp = 48 mb the total p p cross section at \u221a s \u2248 115 TeV, and A part the number of participant nucleons, estimated using the Glauber model for pPb collisions [70] and rescaling to W and Si (Ge) assuming a spherical geometry for nuclei. These values are about a factor two smaller than for nominal p p collisions for the LHCb upgrade, \u03bd pp = L\u03c3 pp / f = 7.6, with L = 2 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and a total p p cross section at \u221a s = 14 TeV of \u03c3 pp = 102.5 mb. Secondary interactions have been studied implementing the geometry of the W target and Ge crystal of S1 scenario in the Geant4 framework. Interactions of protons with the W target and the Ge crystal are generated using Epos [71], tuned to the corresponding average number of primary interactions, whereas \u039b + c events use Pythia and EvtGen [72] to describe their production and decay. Figure 11 illustrates the radiography of the device based on the distribution of stable charged particles. A figure of merit of the occupancy can be obtained from the average number of charged particles within the detector acceptance, using the simplified geometrical model discussed in Sect. 5   Fig. 11 Radiography of the W target and Ge crystal geometries in Geant4, shown in the zy view. The distribution represents the origin vertex for stable charged particles from different physics processes (Compton, \u03b4 rays, hadronic interactions and pair production). The presence of the \u039b + c decay vertex after the crystal is clearly visible Fig. 12 Sketch of a signal event: the \u039b + c baryon, produced in the W target at the primary vertex (PV ) of the event, is channeled and deflected at an angle determined by the crystal curvature \u03b8 C . The secondary vertex (SV ) of the \u039b + c baryon decay is outside the crystal, and its position is determined by the vertex of the decay products similar to the corresponding average in the case of nominal p p collisions for the LHCb upgrade.",

By applying a few selection criteria based on these kinematic variables, e.g. the angle \u03b8 y (invariant mass) to be within a few \u03c3 of \u03b8 C (nominal baryon mass) and the momentum p 800 GeV/c, it would be possible to obtain a high background rejection while retaining most of signal events. For this purpose, the LHCb detector performance are crucial: in particular the estimated track angle resolution of \u224825 \u00b5rad, combined with good momentum and mass resolutions, \u2248 1% [60] and \u2248 20 MeV/c 2 [73], respectively. Particle identification is very limited at momentum regime of several hundreds GeV/c, and is neglected in this study. We assign the particle mass hypothesis based on momentum hierarchy, e.g. for \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , the highest momentum track is assigned to be the p, the second the K \u2212 and the third the \u03c0 + .",

The reconstructed invariant mass helps to reject backgrounds from other channeled hadrons having a similar topology, e.g. the more abundant D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays for \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + signal events.

For other \u039b + c decays no measurements are available but an effective \u03b1 f parameter can be calculated from a Dalitz plot analysis of \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays [78], e.g. \u03b1 \u039b + c \u2192\u0394 ++ K \u2212 = \u22120.67 \u00b1 0.30 [17]. Eventually, a Dalitz plot analysis of \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays would provide the ultimate sensitivity to dipole moments. For the \u039e + c \u2192 \u0394 ++ K \u2212 decay the asymmetry parameter is taken to be similar to the \u039b + c decay to the same final state, whereas for all beauty antibaryon decays it is assumed to be about the same as for the \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + decay. For the \u039e + \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + decay the asymmetry parameter is taken from [4]. The \u03a9 + \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + decay is predominantly parity-conserving and thus has a negligibly small asymmetry parameter [89]. The polarization can be determined in this case from the angular distribution of the antiproton from the \u039b decay, as the \u03a9 + polarization can be related to the polarization of its \u039b child baryon such that s \u03a9 + = s \u039b [90,91]. The initial polarization of \u039b + c particles produced from the interaction of 7 TeV protons on a fixed target is unknown. However, a measurement from interaction of 230 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 on copper target yields s 0 = \u22120.65 +0.22 \u22120.18 for \u039b + c transverse momentum larger than 1.1 GeV/c [92]. Moreover, from data produced in the interactions of 500 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 on five thin target foils (one platinum, four diamond) [78], the polarization of the \u039b + c is measured as a function of the \u039b + c transverse momentum. The average polarization is about \u22120.1, reaching \u22120.7 for p 2 \u22a5 between about 1.24 and 5.2 GeV 2 /c 2 . Considering these measurements and the average transverse momentum of channeled \u039b + c baryons given in Table 4, we assume |s 0 | = 0.6 for both \u039b + c and \u039e + c baryons [54]. The same polarization is assumed for the \u039e and \u03a9 + b antibaryons we take effective quark mass MDM calculations [6]. For all strange baryons under consideration there exist measurements [4].",

A unique opportunity to measure at LHC the EDM and MDM of charm, beauty and strange charged baryons has been discussed here. The experimental setup is based on a fixed-target to be installed in the LHC where protons from the beam halo are deflected using a bent crystal, producing transversally polarized baryons from their interactions with the target. A second bent crystal is positioned after the target where charged baryons that are channeled deflect their trajectory and enter the detector acceptance while rotating their spin. The MDM and EDM information can be inferred from the measurement of the spin-polarization vector after the crystal by analysing the angular distribution of the baryon decay products.",

However, planar channeling efficiency for negative particles is consistently lower than for positive particles, thus much higher statistics is required to perform useful measurements. In that case CP T tests based on the MDM for baryons and antibaryons could be performed. The possibility of exploiting axial channeling of negative particles has been briefly discussed but more studies are needed, including Monte Carlo Geant4 simulations, before drawing any conclusion on the possibility to measure electromagnetic dipole moments.",

            "text": "A ity of the experiment based on the LHCb detector has been assessed relying on both parameterised and Geant4 simulations along with a geometrical model of the detector. Sensitivities for 10 15 PoT could be reached within a few weeks of dedicated detector operations spanned over several years at a flux of 5\u00d710 8 p/ s. The possibility of a dedicated experiment a covering larger pseudorapidity region, able to afford higher proton fluxes and longer data taking periods, has also been discussed. For the LHCb layout, optimal bent crystal parameters are determined to be 7 cm (5 cm) length and 14 mrad (15 mrad) bending angle for Si (Ge), whereas for the dedicated experiment are found to be 12 cm (7 cm) and 7 mrad (8 mrad). In all cases, Ge crystals provide enhanced sensitivity. This unique physics program would provide important experimental anchor points for QCD calculations and searches for physics beyond the SM. In the case of charm and beauty baryon EDM the limits would be better than current indirect bounds based on the neutron EDM [11,13,16], extending the new physics discovery potential of the LHC.",

This decay has been measured and its branching fraction times the \u039e+ b fragmentation function is \u2248 6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 [4]. Secondly, the \u039e + b \u2192 \u039e 0 c \u03c0 + decay,where the charm antibaryon can be reconstructed in the \u039e+ \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u039e + \u03c0 \u2212 or pK + K + \u03c0 \u2212 finalstates.
