The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 recorded in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in the process tt \u2192 W \u00b1 bH \u2213b , where the W boson decays to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino. The decays lead to a final state comprising an isolated lepton, at least four jets and large missing transverse energy. No significant deviation is observed in the data with respect to the standard model predictions, and model-independent upper limits are set on the branching fraction B(t \u2192 H + b), ranging from 1.2 to 6.5% for a charged Higgs boson with mass between 90 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that B(H + \u2192 cs) = 100%.",

            "text": "A Higgs boson has recently been discovered by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2,3] Collaborations with a mass around 125 GeV and properties consistent with those expected from the standard model (SM) within the current experimental uncertainties. However, precise measurements of the properties of the new boson are needed to identify or exclude differences with respect to the SM predictions. The mass of the Higgs boson itself is subject to quadratically divergent corrections at high energies [4]. Several extensions beyond the SM (BSM) have been proposed to address such divergences. Supersymmetry [5][6][7] is one such model that invokes a symmetry between fundamental fermions and bosons. The Higgs sector of the so-called minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [8,9] consists of two Higgs doublets, resulting in five physical states: a light and a heavy CP-even h and H, a CP-odd A, and two charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 . At lowest order, the MSSM Higgs sector can be expressed in terms of two parameters, usually chosen as the mass of the CP-odd boson (m A ) and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan \u03b2). The generic two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), of which the MSSM is a special case, encompasses the following four scenarios.",

The dotted line represents the total number of expected signal and background events in the presence of H + obtained using eq. (33) for an assumed branching fraction of B(t \u2192 H + b) = 10%. This line is below the total background expectation, because the reduction in the SM tt yield is not fully compensated by the HW component and we are missing the tt \u2192 bH + bH \u2212 component as we select the events with a high p T lepton. Other distributions such as p T and \u03b7 of the lepton, jets, and b jets as well as the jet multiplicity and b-jet multiplicity were studied.
