            "text": "Differential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries for the \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u039b(1520) reaction have been measured with linearly polarized photon beams at energies from the threshold to 2.4 GeV at 0.6< cos \u03b8 K CM <1. A new bump structure was found at W \u2243 2.11 GeV in the cross sections. The bump is not well reproduced by theoretical calculations introducing a nucleon resonance with J \u2264 3 2 . This result suggests that the bump might be produced by a nucleon resonance possibly with J \u2265 5 2 or by a new reaction process, for example an interference effect with the \u03c6 photoproduction having a similar bump structure in the cross sections. Strangeness photoproduction is an important tool to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of baryon resonances. Theoretically, constituent quark models predict more nucleon resonances than those observed in pion scattering reactions. Quark model studies suggest that these missing resonances couple to strangeness channels which are not only KY (Y =\u039b or \u03a3) but also KY * (Y * =\u039b * or \u03a3 * ) [1]. Some nucleon resonances have been observed at the near-threshold energies in the KY photoproduction [2][3][4]. The threshold for the KY * photoproduction is relatively high compared with that for the \u03c0N , \u03b7N , and KY photoproduction. Therefore, photoproduction leading to the KY * state is a good way to investigate poorly understood nucleon resonances with a heavy mass.",

The cause of the bump has not been clarified yet. Measuring cross sections and spin observables for these relevant reactions, which have similar energy thresholds and final states, could play an important role in clarifying the cause of the bump.

            "text": "The reaction mechanism of the K + \u039b(1520) photoproduction is often described in terms of hadron exchanges, with N and N * in the s-channel, Y and Y * in the uchannel, and K and K * in the t-channel. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the contact term (to satisfy the gauge invariance) is dominant and the s-channel contribution is negligibly small in the K + \u039b(1520) reaction [7,8]. Another theoretical study suggests that the K * exchange contribution is small [9]. On the other hand, previous K + \u039b(1520) photoproduction data at the center-of-mass (CM) energies (W = \u221a s) of W =2.48-3.14 GeV (E \u03b3 =2.  show that K * exchange in the t-channel is dominant [10]. Recent K + \u039b(1520) electroproduction data at W =1.95-2.65 GeV show that contributions from K and K * exchanges are roughly equal [11]. Therefore, additional data with new observables are needed for solving this controversial situation. The photon-beam asymmetry (\u03a3) for K + \u039b(1520) photoproduction has some unique features. Nam et al. predict that \u03a3 = \u22121 or \u03a3 >0 if the K or K * meson is exchanged in the t-channel, respectively [8]. The contact term, uchannel, and s-channel N exchange contributions give almost zero asymmetries. Hence, a measurement of the \u03a3 asymmetry provides strong constraints in understanding the K + \u039b(1520) photoproduction mechanism.",

            "text": "In the past, experimental data for hyperon photoproduction at the near-threshold energies were available only for the K + \u039b and K + \u03a3 0 states [2-4, 12, 13]. Recently, new experimental results for K 0 \u03a3 + [14], K + \u03a3 \u2212 [15], K * 0 \u03a3 + [16,17], K + \u039b(1405) [18], and K + \u03a3 \u2212 (1385) [19] have been reported. However, there are only two old published results on K + \u039b(1520) photoproduction at energies of E \u03b3 =2.8-4.8 GeV [10] and E \u03b3 =11 GeV [20]. New experimental data near the K + \u039b(1520) threshold are useful to investigate the possibility of new nucleon resonances, to obtain key information for clarifying the cause of the bump found in the \u03c6 photoproduction, and to understand the K + \u039b(1520) reaction mechanism. In this Letter, we present, for the first time, differential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries for the \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u039b(1520) reaction at 0.6< cos \u03b8 K CM <1 at the near-threshold energies. The experiment was carried out using the laserelectron photon facility at SPring-8 (LEPS) [21]. The energy range of tagged photons was 1.5-2.4 GeV, and the polarization of linearly polarized photons was 52-90% at 1.5-2.4 GeV. We used a liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) target with an effective length of 16 cm. Charged particles produced at the target were detected at forward angles with the LEPS spectrometer system for trajectory tracking. Time-of-flight information was obtained for each charged particle track. The start signal was produced by a plastic scintillator (SC) located behind the target, and the stop signal was produced by an array of 40 plastic scintillators at the downstream of the spectrometer. The K + meson was identified from its mass, within 3\u03c3 where \u03c3 is the momentum dependent mass resolution. The data sample with the single K + meson was analyzed. Figure 1 shows the missing mass (M M \u03b3K + ) spectrum for the p( \u03b3,K + )X reaction. The wide lower-mass peak corresponds to the \u03a3 0 (1385) and \u039b(1405) production, and the narrow higher-mass peak corresponds to the \u039b(1520). The \u039b(1520) yield was obtained by fitting the peaks in the missing mass spectrum. The photon energy region from the threshold to 2.4 GeV was divided into 15 bins and the K + polar angle region in the CM system was divided into 4 bins. The peak shape of each hyperon resonance was estimated by GEANT simulations. Breit-Wigner shapes with masses of 1.384, 1.407, and 1.520 GeV and widths of 36, 50, and 16 MeV were used to generate the \u03a3 0 (1385), \u039b(1405), and \u039b(1520) hyperon resonances, respectively [22]. The masses and widths of the hyperon resonances are uncertain [22], and these uncertainties were evaluated as systematic errors. The peak shape was reproduced by the missing mass of the p(\u03b3,K + )X reaction in the simulations including the experimental resolution. The peak shape was fixed in the fit to the experimental missing mass spectrum and the height of the peak was adjusted as a free parameter. There is a small bump at 1.66 GeV, probably due to the \u03a3 0 (1660). Since the mass and width of the \u03a3 0 (1660) are not well known, the same peak shape as the \u039b(1520) was used, but with its position fixed at 1.660 GeV in the fit. . The thick solid curve is the result of the fit using the polynomial background (thin solid curve). The dashed, dotted, and hatched curves correspond to \u03a3 0 (1385)/\u039b(1405), \u039b(1520), and \u03a3 0 (1660) productions, respectively. The dotted-dashed curve is the background obtained by the fit using simulation curves.",

Uncertainties of the target thickness, photon flux, and detector acceptance are 1%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. The \u03c0 + contamination in the particle identification of the K + is negligibly small. When the K + is detected at forward angles, the vertex resolution becomes poor. The contamination of events from the SC in the vertex selection of the LH 2 target is smaller than 3% at W > 2.04 GeV and smaller than 7% at W <2.04 GeV.",

Systematic uncertainties of the shape, mass, and width of the \u039b(1520), \u03a3 0 (1385), \u039b(1405), and \u03a3 0 (1660) hyperon resonances cause the uncertainty, \u03b4\u03a3=0.05. A fit with background curves generated for the \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u03c0Y , K * Y , K + KN , and \u03c6p reactions by the simulations is consistent within the statistical error. The effect of the \u03c0 + contamination in the K + selection is negligible. When the K + is detected at forward angles, the vertex resolution becomes poor. The effect of the contamination of events from the SC in the vertex selection of the LH 2 target is also negligible. The attenuation of the asymmetry by the finite number of the azimuthal angle bins (9 bins) is about \u03b4\u03a3=0.015. The systematic uncertainty of the measurement of the laser polarization is \u03b4\u03a3=0.02. Figure 4(b) shows the photon-beam asymmetries for the K + \u039b(1520) reaction at 0.6< cos \u03b8 K CM <1 in comparison with those for the K + \u039b(1116) reaction at cos \u03b8 K CM \u223c0.85 [27]. The K + \u039b(1520) asymmetries are near zero at W <2.2 GeV and increase gradually with the CM energy. The small positive values at W >2.2 GeV might indicate that the contribution from the K * exchange is larger than that from the K exchange. The asymmetries for the K + \u039b(1520) reaction are smaller than those for the K + \u039b(1116) reaction. One reason of the small K + \u039b(1520) asymmetries is that the K * exchange contribution may be smaller than that in the K + \u039b(1116) reaction. The contact term and K exchange contributions make the K + \u039b(1520) asymmetries smaller. This comparison suggests that the K + \u039b(1520) reaction mechanism is different from the K + \u039b(1116) reaction mechanism at these near-threshold energies.",

The calculations use the parameters obtained from fits to the present cross sections. There is no significant difference between the results of these calculations as shown in Fig. 4(b). Since all theoretical asymmetries are close to zero and agree with the data at W <2.2 GeV, we cannot judge whether the bump is due to a nucleon resonance or not. The measurement of additional spin observables is needed to clarify the cause of the bump. The calculations underestimate the data by 1-3 standard  [24]. The parity for the resonances does not change the theoretical asymmetries significantly. The result of calculations without a nucleon resonance is almost identical to the solid curve.",

A bump structure was found in the cross sections. As one possible explanation, we introduce a nucleon resonance with J \u2264 3 2 in the theoretical calculations dominated by the contact term contribution, although the angular coverage of our data is inadequate to obtain strong evidence for the nucleon resonance. The calculations reproduce the energy depen-dence of the bump at forward K + angles, but fail to reproduce the angular distribution of the bump. Further theoretical calculations with J \u2265 5 2 resonances are necessary to examine the presence of a nucleon resonance. Another possible explanation is that the bump might be produced by a new reaction process, for example an interference effect with \u03c6 photoproduction. The K + \u039b(1520) asymmetries have small positive values at W >2.2 GeV, which may indicate that the contribution from the K * exchange is larger than that from the K exchange. The asymmetries for the K + \u039b(1520) reaction are smaller than those for the K + \u039b(1116) reaction, which confirms that the K + \u039b(1520) reaction mechanism is different from the K + \u039b(1116) reaction mechanism at these near-threshold energies. The present result stimulates future experimental and theoretical studies for not only the KY * photoproduction reaction but also other relevant reactions with wider angular coverage, and will advance our understanding of the hadron photoproduction and baryon resonance.",
