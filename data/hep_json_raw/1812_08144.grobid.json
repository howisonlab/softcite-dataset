Theoretical studies show how observables related to the \u2192 * + \u2212 ] differential decay distribution can be used to further constrain New Physics contributions, but their experimental measurements are lacking to date. This article proposes the measurement of \u2192 * + \u2212 ] angular and -violating observables at hadron collider experiments, by exploiting approximate reconstruction algorithms using information from detectable final-state particles only. The resolution on the phase space variables is studied using \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decays simulated in a forward detector geometry like LHCb. A method to correct the observable values for the reconstruction inaccuracies based on detector simulation is successfully tested on simulated data and the decrease in precision with respect to a perfect reconstruction is evaluated. The * + longitudinal polarization fraction and the A (2) -violating observable can be measured losing a factor of 2 and 5 in precision, respectively. The extraction of angular distributions from the template fit selecting \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decays and associated systematic uncertainties are also discussed.",

In * + and \u2212 ] helicity frames, the axis is defined by the direction of the * + and \u2212 ] momenta in the rest frame, respectively. The attainable precision on the four phase space variables is studied computing the resolution defined as the difference between the values measured using the reconstruction algorithms and the true values of the simulated events. Differences of dimensional quantities are divided by the true values.  The rest frame reconstruction for \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decays is achieved exploiting the full reconstruction algorithm. If a couple of solutions are found, one of the two is selected by random choice, while apparently unphysical configurations, due to experimental uncertainties, in which no momentum solution is available are discarded from the following study, these constituting the 32.7% of the simulated events. Regression techniques based on meson flight direction and magnitude to improve the solution decision [24] have been tried but showed limited improvement. The relative resolution on the momentum magnitude, obtained with the two reconstruction algorithms, is shown in Figure 2. The full reconstruction momentum resolution features a narrow, symmetric distribution peaked at zero, corresponding to events in which the momentum solution corresponding to the true orientation of the neutrino (forward or backward) was chosen, and a broader, asymmetric shape associated to events in which the momentum solution corresponding to the wrong neutrino orientation was assigned. The equal velocity reconstruction presents a more regular but wider distribution. The phase space variables describing the semileptonic decay are computed in the rest frame resulting from the estimated momentum. Their resolutions are reported in Figure 3: the cos 0 and feature symmetric and unbiased distributions, the cos distribution is slightly asymmetric but almost unbiased and the relative 2 even if asymmetric peaks at zero. Phase space variable resolutions obtained with the equal velocity algorithm are reported in Figure 4. Their distributions are wider than those resulting from the full reconstruction algorithm, since less information on the decay is employed.",

Then, the momentum is calculated from the * + \u2212 system using the estimated momentum: if there are two momentum solutions one is chosen randomly.

Phase space variables resolutions for full reconstruction algorithm are reported in Figure 6, which are to be compared to those obtained applying the equal velocity algorithm, see Figure 7.

Comparing to the tau lepton hadronic decay channel, the distributions are similar to the more precise resolutions of the full reconstruction algorithm rather than to those obtained with the equal velocity algorithm. Thus, the knowledge of the tau lepton flight direction in the three pion decay mode is not able to add significant information to the decay reconstruction due to the increased ambiguity in the momentum determination. Summarizing, cos 0 and resolution distributions have been shown to be symmetric and unbiased for all the \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decay channels, and the related physical quantities are therefore suitable to be measured even at hadron collider experiments, making use of the presented reconstruction algorithms only.

Simulated events are weighted to reproduce one of the angle decay distributions at generation-level, as a function of the -violating observables. TPAs are built from the reconstructed value of the angle; for the distribution reported in (14) the sin 2 0 dependence is included to take into account uncertainties in the cos 0 sign determination. Three values for the corresponding -conserving quantities A ( ) = 0, \u00b11 have been considered, but it is shown that they have no impact on the TPAs measurement. In fact, cos and cos 2 terms still integrate to zero when computing asymmetries using reconstructed angles, since the angle resolution distribution is not biased. The linear relation between reconstructed asymmetries and generated -violating observables allows to correct for the dilution effects and to determine the decrease in precision from the inverse of the slope of the straight line.",

On the contrary, the small decrease in precision between A (0) and A (2) shows that the effect of the integration of the sin 2 0 terms is modest and the measurement of the -violating A (2) observable is viable for both muon and tau decay modes.

The accuracy of detector simulation in particle physics experiment is routinely checked with respect to data, and remaining differences between real and simulated events are corrected exploiting suitable \"control\" decays as similar as possible to the transitions under study [6,7]. Moreover, the simulation of the detector resolution due to the reconstruction algorithms, exploited to correct the observable values, is based upon the decay kinematics (particle momenta and decay vertex position distributions), which is easy to simulate with high accuracy. No significant differences between real and simulated angular distribution are thus expected and the associated systematic uncertainties can not have a significant impact.",

This permits an additional search for New Physics in \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decays complementary to the already measured ( * ) ratio. The -violating A (2) observable can be measured from the associated triple-product asymmetry with a decrease in sensitivity of a factor 5, while the A (1) observable is measurable only for \u2192 * + \u2212 ] decays due to the form of the associated angle distribution.
