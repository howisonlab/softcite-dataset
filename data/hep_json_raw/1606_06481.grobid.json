The main goal of these studies is the measurement of radiative decays of excited vector resonances of the \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 families [2], as well as the search for rare processes of C-even resonance production in the e + e \u2212 annihilation [3,4]. While searching for the rare reactions mentioned above, hadronic processes containing \u03c9-meson in the final state decaying into \u03c0 0 \u03b3 constitute a significant background (the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 branching fraction is (8.28 \u00b1 0.28)% [5]). For example, the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 [1] dominates in the five-photon final state and hinders the search for the radiative processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 0 \u03b3, f 2 \u03b3.",

This analysis uses data collected in 2010-2012. During the experiments, the energy range 1.05-2.00 GeV was scanned several times with a step of 20-25 MeV. Because of the smallness of statistics, we measure the cross section averaged over the energy intervals, listed in Table I. A detailed description of the SND detector is given in Refs. [7][8][9][10]. The main part of this non-magnetic detector is a three-layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter based on NaI(Tl) crystals. The solid angle coverage of the calorimeter is 95% of 4\u03c0. Its energy resolution for photons is \u03c3 E\u03b3 /E \u03b3 = 4.2%/ 4 E \u03b3 (GeV), and the angular resolution is about 1.5 \u2022 . Direction of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a nine-layer drift chamber and a proportional chamber with the signal readout from the cathode strips. The solid angle coverage of the tracking system is 94% of 4\u03c0. From the outside the SND calorimeter is surrounded by a muon system. In this analysis, the muon system veto is used to suppress the cosmic-ray background.",

The fit is performed under the hypothesis that the seven-photon event proceed through the particular set of intermediate particles (with corresponding mass constraints), and satisfies energy-momentum conservation laws. As a result of the kinematic fit, photon energies are refined and the \u03c7 2 of the assumed kinematic hypothesis is calculated. First of all, the e + e \u2212 \u2192 7\u03b3 hypothesis is tested, and the condition \u03c7 2 7\u03b3 < 30 is imposed. Then the photon pairs, candidates for the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons, are searched. It is required that the invariant mass of the candidate is in the range (m \u03c0 0 ,\u03b7 \u2212 50 MeV, m \u03c0 0 ,\u03b7 + 50 MeV). Events with one \u03b7 meson candidate and two \u03c0 0 candidates are selected as possible signal events.

Events with \u03c7 2 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 < 50 are rejected. For remaining events, a kinematic fit is performed to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b72\u03c0 0 \u03b3 hypothesis.

            "text": "We have analyzed data collected in the experiment with the SND detector at the e + e \u2212 collider VEPP-2000 in the c.m. energy range from 1.05 to 2.00 GeV. In the seven-photon final state, events of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 have been separated. Most of these events come from the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u03c0 0 . We have measured the cross section for this process for the first time. It has a threshold at 1.75 GeV. The cross section value in the energy range 1.8-2.0 GeV is about 2 nb, approximately 5% of the total hadronic cross section in this energy range. From the analysis of the \u03b7\u03c0 0 invariant mass spectrum, it has been found that the dominant mechanism of the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 is the \u03c9a 0 (980) intermediate state.",
