The data sample, collected with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 . The measurements are performed using events with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons) and two or more jets, where at least one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. The charge asymmetry is measured from differences in kinematic distributions, unfolded to the parton level, of positively and negatively charged top quarks and leptons.",

            "text": "The exceptionally large mass of the top quark, measured by this experiment as m t = 172.44 \u00b1 0.48 GeV [1], suggests the top quark could have an important connection to physics beyond the standard model (SM), particularly in the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. Precision measurements of top quark properties have the potential to identify the first hints of new particles, particularly those with stronger couplings to top quarks than to other fundamental particles. The SM predicts a charge asymmetry in tt production at hadron colliders through quarkantiquark annihilation. This asymmetry is caused by the interference between the Born and the box diagrams, as well as between the initial-and final-state radiation diagrams, and is predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) [2,3]. Early measurements of this asymmetry by the CDF [4] and D0 [5] Collaborations exceeded the NLO predictions [2,3] by about two standard deviations, and the discrepancy was more pronounced in the CDF events with large tt invariant mass (M tt > 450 GeV). These results have led to considerations that the anomalous asymmetry might be generated by tree-level exchanges of new particles or by interference effects from new physics at higher mass scales, not directly observable at the LHC [6]. Recent E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. developments in experimental techniques [7,8] and theoretical predictions such as the inclusion of EW [9-12] and next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) QCD [13,14] corrections have largely resolved the disagreement between theory and the Tevatron measurements. Nonetheless, the charge asymmetry remains an important probe of new physics.",

The proton-proton (pp) initial state at the LHC is expected to produce top quark and antiquark rapidity distributions that are symmetric about y = 0. However, since the quarks in the initial state can be from valence, while the antiquarks are from the sea, the larger average momentum-fraction of quarks leads to an excess of top quarks produced in the forward directions. The rapidity distribution of top quarks in the SM is therefore broader than that of the more centrally produced top antiquarks, meaning |y t | = |y t | \u2212 |y t | is a suitable observable to measure the tt charge asymmetry, defined in terms of event yields N as",

The CRs are selected to have similar kinematic properties to the signal region, but with one or two requirements inverted, thus enriching them in different background contributions [25]. Agreement between data and simulation is observed in the tW CR, and we assign a 25% uncertainty in the tW cross section based on the recent CMS measurement of 23.4 \u00b1 5.4 pb [59].

In the context of theoretical calculations and parton shower event generators, the parton-level top quark is defined before it decays and its kinematic properties include the effects of recoil from initial-and final-state radiation in the rest of the event and from final-state radiation from the top quark itself.

For the reconstructionlevel distributions, we use twice as many bins as those used for the parton-level distributions. The unfolding is performed using the TUnfold package [63], using regularization based on the curvature of the simulated signal distribution to suppress statistical fluctuations in the high frequency components of the unfolded distribution. The regularization strength is optimized by minimizing the average global correlation coefficient in the unfolded distribution; the resulting regularization is relatively weak, contributing at the level of 5% to the total \u03c7 2 minimized by the algorithm. An analogous unfolding procedure is used to measure A C and A lep C differentially, after introducing a further three bins in each of the tt system kinematic variables M tt , |y tt |, and p tt T .",

The uncertainty from the jet energy scale corrections is estimated by varying the jet energies within their uncertainties [64] and propagating this to the p miss T . Similarly, the jet energy resolution is Many of the signal modeling and simulation uncertainties are evaluated by using weights to vary the mc@nlo tt sample: the simulated pileup multiplicity distribution is changed within its uncertainty; the correction factors between data and simulation for the b tagging efficiency [32], trigger efficiency, and lepton selection efficiency are shifted up and down by their uncertainties; and the PDFs are varied using the PDF4LHC procedure [65,66]. Previous CMS studies [67,68] have shown that the p T distribution of the top quark in data is softer than in the NLO simulation of tt production. Since the origin of the discrepancy is not fully understood, the change in the measurement when reweighting the mc@nlo tt sample to match the top quark p T spectrum in data is taken as a systematic uncertainty associated with signal modeling. Further signal modeling uncertainties are evaluated using the dedicated tt samples: \u03bc R and \u03bc F are simultaneously varied up and down by a factor of 2, m t is varied by \u00b11 GeV, and the tt sample generated with powheg and pythia is used to measure the uncertainty in hadronization modeling from the difference between the herwig and pythia descriptions. The systematic uncertainty estimates evaluated using dedicated tt samples have a significant statistical uncertainty governed by the number of events in the simulated samples. To avoid underestimation of these uncertainties, the maximum of the estimated systematic uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty in that estimate is taken as the final systematic uncertainty.",
