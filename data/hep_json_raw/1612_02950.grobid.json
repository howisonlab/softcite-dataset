The differential cross-section, assuming unpolarised J/\u03c8 production, is measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the lowerp T J/\u03c8 meson, di-J/\u03c8 p T and mass, the difference in rapidity between the two J/\u03c8 mesons, and the azimuthal angle between the two J/\u03c8 mesons. The fraction of prompt pair events due to double parton scattering is determined by studying kinematic correlations between the two J/\u03c8 mesons. The total and double parton scattering cross-sections are compared with predictions. The effective cross-section of double parton scattering is measured to be \u03c3 eff = 6.3 \u00b1 1.6(stat) \u00b1 1.0(syst) mb.",

These events are also sensitive to next-to-leading-order (NLO) and higher-order perturbative QCD corrections, in addition to providing an opportunity to study and compare J/\u03c8 production models. Di-J/\u03c8 events can be produced from a single gluon-gluon collision via single parton scattering (SPS) or from two independent parton-parton scatters in a single proton-proton collision, known as double parton scattering (DPS).",

Although the di-J/\u03c8 process has a low production rate in hadron collisions, the high luminosity and energy of the LHC allows a more detailed study than previously possible [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. State-of-theart techniques have been developed to describe di-J/\u03c8 production in leading-order (LO), NLO, next-to-leading-order colour singlet non-relativistic QCD computations without loops (NLO*), and intrinsic parton transverse momentum calculations. Contributions of gluon fragmentation and quark fragmentation, which occur at even higher order calculations have been shown to make a large difference in the predictions [8].",

            "text": "Prompt J/\u03c8 mesons can be produced directly [13-20] or via a higher-mass charmonium state, such as \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X or \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X . These feed-down events resemble direct gluon-gluon fusion J/\u03c8 production. Non-prompt events can be identified by their displaced decay vertex from the decay of b-hadrons. The focus of this paper is on prompt-prompt (PP) di-J/\u03c8 production with the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . This decay channel has the advantage of a clean four-muon signal. Examples of prompt-prompt di-J/\u03c8 production diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. It is expected that DPS plays a larger role at high energies and could be increasingly important for cccc production [21,22]. DPS can help to explain the cross-section of multi-jet production and the large difference in rapidity 1 for hard interaction processes [23]. As di-J/\u03c8 production is dominated by gluon interactions, it gives information complementary to recent effective cross-section measurements of quark-dominated interactions. The effective cross-section is a factor which relates the production cross-section of the two individual interactions to the total interaction. Due to the low production rate of prompt J/\u03c8 meson pairs, this process has not been studied in as much detail as other DPS processes and can therefore provide a good test of the process dependence of the effective cross-section. Testing possible correlations of non-perturbative origin between the partons 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system where the nominal interaction point (IP) is defined as the origin, the z-axis defines the beam direction, and the x-y plane is transverse to the beam direction. The positive x-axis is defined to point from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the positive y-axis points upward. The azimuthal angle, \u03c6, is measured around the beam axis and the polar angle, \u03b8, is measured from the beam axis. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212ln[tan(\u03b8/2)] and for massive particles the rapidity y = 1/2",

The lowerp T (sub-leading) J/\u03c8 meson is denoted as J/\u03c8 2 hereafter. Measurements are presented in two regions of the sub-leading J/\u03c8 meson rapidity both within the muon p T acceptance and extrapolated to the full acceptance by integrating the muon transverse momentum to zero. Additionally, the differential cross-section over the full J/\u03c8 rapidity region defined by the muon selection criteria is measured for these variables along with the difference in rapidity and the azimuthal angle between the two J/\u03c8 mesons. Using the sub-leading J/\u03c8 meson allows the full range of the muon kinematic region to be explored. As the mass resolution for J/\u03c8 mesons is worse at forward rapidities, the cross-section is measured in two rapidity regions, |y(J/\u03c8 2 )| < 1.05 and 1.05 \u2264 |y(J/\u03c8 2 )| < 2.1, to increase the sensitivity of the results.",

The inner detector (ID) is composed of the pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker (SCT), and the transition radiation tracker (TRT). The pixel and SCT detectors cover the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The barrel is constructed from concentric cylinders around the beam axis and in the end-caps the disks are oriented perpendicular to the beam axis. The TRT is made up of straws filled with gas. It covers a range of |\u03b7| \u2264 2.0. The TRT surrounds the SCT and provides r -\u03c6 information as well as electron identification information from transition radiation photons. The ID is surrounded by a solenoid which provides a 2 T axial magnetic field. The calorimeter has separate electromagnetic and hadronic components. The muon spectrometer (MS) consists of monitored drift tubes for |\u03b7| \u2264 2.7 in combination with cathode strip chambers for 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.7. Additionally, there are two types of triggering chambers, the resistive plate chambers (RPC) and the thin gap chambers (TGC). The MS is designed to provide precise position and momentum measurements in the bending plane and is capable of stand-alone muon reconstruction. The ATLAS trigger system has three levels (Level-1, Level-2, Event Filter). The Level-1 muon trigger uses information from three layers of RPCs in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.05) and three layers of TGCs in the end-cap regions (1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4). The geometric coverage of the Level-1 trigger for single muons is about 99% in the end-cap regions and about 80% in the barrel region [46]. Information from the ID and MS is included in the Level-2 and Event Filter triggers.",

A narrow Gaussian describes the prompt J/\u03c8 component and a wider Gaussian describes the component due to pile-up. Only the relative normalisation is free in the fit to the di-J/\u03c8 sample. The other parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined from a fit to the large inclusive J/\u03c8 sample over a wide d z range. In the fit of the inclusive J/\u03c8 sample, the pile-up distribution is found to have a Gaussian width of 49.2 \u00b1 0.8 mm. The background is determined by integrating the fitted function over the selected d z range of |d z | \u2264 1.2 mm.",

The systematic uncertainty is described in Sect. 6. As a check, the signal PP Gaussian width is allowed to be free in the di-J/\u03c8 d z fit. The width is compatible with the value calculated from the inclusive J/\u03c8 sample but with a much larger uncertainty. Finally, to remove the pile-up background, the pile-up distributions of the kinematic variables are needed. This is achieved by reversing the |d z | requirement to |d z | > 2.0 mm. The distribution of the chosen variable with this new requirement is then plotted to get the distributions of events coming from two separate primary vertices.

The DPS sample is therefore simulated by combining re-sampled J/\u03c8 mesons from two different random events in the di-J/\u03c8 sample which pass the requirements. By using events from the di-J/\u03c8 sample, it is ensured that the J/\u03c8 candidates in the DPS sample have the same kinematics as the data. The distribution of the absolute difference between the rapidities, y, against the absolute difference between the azimuthal angles, \u03c6, of the two J/\u03c8 candidates for this DPS sample is shown in Fig. 7a. The template for the SPS component, shown in Fig. 7b, is obtained by subtracting the DPS template from the y against \u03c6 distribution of the background-subtracted data. The DPS contribution is normalised to the data in the region y \u2265 1.8 and \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/2, where DPS is assumed to dominate and SPS is assumed to be negligible. The DPS-dominated region is determined after a careful study of the data. The y requirement is determined as before this region the data drops off quickly with y and after it flattens out which is indicative of a dominant DPS contribution. After examining the data, it is observed that the peak at \u03c6 = \u03c0 has a large tail in y and therefore an additional requirement is placed to avoid this tail. Additionally, theoretical predictions [10,11] show that SPS is negligible in this region. The assumption of and sensitivity to the definition of the DPS-dominated region is tested by increasing the y and varying the \u03c6 requirements. By increasing the y requirement to a smaller region in which SPS is known to be negligible, the possibility of a SPS tail making it into the normalisation region is determined. Tests of the normalisation are included in Sect. 7.2. At low \u03c6 and large y, DPS dominates and this validates the choice of region used to normalise the DPS template to the data ( y \u2265 1.8, \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/2).",

The colour octet contributions and the intrinsic parton transverse momentum are not included in the predictions. The DPS predictions in Refs. [10,11] are based on the models from Refs. [39,43], which assume factorisation of perturbative QCD and use an approximate prompt single-J/\u03c8 matrix element modelled from combined fits of data from multiple experiments. For comparison, the DPS predictions from Ref. [43] are used. The DPS predictions are created using the MSTW2008 NLO [84] parton distribution function. The theory predictions are made in the muon fiducial volume and assume unpolarised J/\u03c8 mesons, and therefore the acceptance correction is not needed for comparison with the predictions. In Fig. 11, the DPS-weighted distribution produced from the event weights of the datadriven method and the total distribution are compared to the LO DPS and sum of the LO DPS and NLO* SPS predictions. The DPS predictions are normalised to the f DPS value measured with the data-driven model. For the NLO* SPS predictions, a constant correction factor of 1.85 is applied for feed-down [10] from \u03c8(2S) which is present in the data. Changes in SPS predictions from varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales of perturbative QCD, as well as the mass of the charm quark are assigned as systematic uncertainties.",

For better clarity the errors  A comparison of the di-J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution in Fig. 11c with that in Fig. 12a shows that the events in the region of excess ( y \u2265 1.8) have large di-J/\u03c8 invariant mass, as expected from the relationship between the invariant mass and the difference in rapidity. The di-J/\u03c8 transverse momentum, shown in Fig. 12b, has an SPS peak near zero and then falls off monotonically while the DPS peaks at a slightly larger p T . This indicates that the two J/\u03c8 mesons are produced in an away topology. The \u03c6 distribution in this region, shown in Fig. 12c, is not uniform as would be expected for a pure DPS: there is a large SPS peak from the away topology peaked at \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0 . To make this comparison easier, the \u03c6 distribution is also shown on linear vertical scale in Fig. 12d. A plausible explanation for the excess of SPS in the distribution is the presence of a non-constant contribution to the di-J/\u03c8 final state from feed-down of backto-back SPS pair production from excited charmonium states which could change the kinematic properties of the SPS distribution [12,42].",

The increase at large di-J/\u03c8 mass and y is also predicted in Ref. [42], which studied all possible Fock state contributions to the SPS production of prompt J/\u03c8 meson pairs. A significant non-constant contribution from feed-down is a possible explanation of the much quicker drop off of the tail in the NLO* SPS predictions relative to the datadriven distribution, seen in Fig. 11a-d. Because feed-down can have a distribution similar to DPS, it can explain why the predictions seem to require a larger f DPS value than measured by the data-driven distribution. A larger f DPS would not explain the peak at \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0 for y \u2265 1.8, which can be explained by SPS from a non-constant feed-down contribution. Additionally, the wide peak seen at low di-J/\u03c8 p T can be explained either by a large effect due to the inclusion of the intrinsic parton transverse momentum, smearing due to a non-constant feed-down component, or a combination of the two.",

The shapes of the measured double   parton scattering distributions are consistent with model predictions. For single parton scattering, the results are characterised by distributions wider than the next-to-leading-order predictions as seen in the absolute difference between the rapidities of the two J/\u03c8, the absolute difference between the azimuthal angles, the invariant mass of the di-J/\u03c8, and the di-J/\u03c8 transverse momentum. A significant fraction of events appear to correspond to a topology in which the two colour singlet J/\u03c8 mesons are produced in the same direction and back-to-back with respect to an additional gluon. This topology is only included in nextto-leading-order calculations. A theoretical model based on leading-order DPS plus next-to-leading-order-colour singlet model SPS predictions without loops (NLO*) describes the data well, including in the kinematic regions where NLO contributions dominate. Possible explanations for the difference between the data and theoretical predictions at large y and invariant mass might be the need to include a large effect due to the inclusion of the intrinsic parton transverse momentum or a contribution via feed-down from a colour-singlet \u03c8(2S) meson which does not have the same kinematic properties as the NLO* SPS predictions. The contribution from feed-down can amount to 40% of the single parton scattering cross-section.
