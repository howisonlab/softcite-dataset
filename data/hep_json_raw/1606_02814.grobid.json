The data were collected by the D0 experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 . The matrix element technique is applied to tt events in the final state containing leptons (electrons or muons) with high transverse momenta and at least two jets. The calibration of the jet energy scale determined in the lepton + jets final state of tt decays is applied to jet energies. This correction provides a substantial reduction in systematic uncertainties. We obtain a top quark mass of mt = 173.93 \u00b1 1.84 GeV.",

Its mass (m t ) is a free parameter of the SM Lagrangian that is not predicted from first principles. The top quark was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Tevatron pp collider at Fermilab [6,7]. Despite the fact that the top quark decays weakly, its large mass leads to a very short lifetime of approximately 5 \u2022 10 \u221225 s [8][9][10]. It decays into a W boson and a b quark before hadronizing, a process that has a characteristic time scale of 1/\u039b QCD \u2248 (200 MeV) \u22121 , equivalent to \u03c4 had \u2248 3.3 \u2022 10 \u221224 s, where \u039b QCD is the fundamental scale of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This provides an opportunity to measure the mass of the top quark with high precision due to possibility of reconstructing the top quark parameters using its decay particles.",

This results in final states with two, one, or no leptons, which are referred to as the dilepton (\u2113\u2113), lepton + jets (\u2113+jets), and alljet channels, respectively. In this measurement we use events in the dilepton final state where both W bosons decay to leptons: tt \u2192 W + b W \u2212b \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bd \u2113 b \u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113b . More specifically, we consider three combinations of leptons, ee, e\u00b5, and \u00b5\u00b5, including also electrons and muons from leptonic decays of \u03c4 leptons, W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113\u03bd \u2113 \u03bd \u03c4 . We present an updated measurement of the top quark mass in the dilepton channel using the matrix element (ME) approach [13]. This measurement improves the previous result using the matrix element technique with 5.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity [39] by a factor of 1.6, where the statistical uncertainty is improved by a factor of 1.1 and systematic uncertainty by a factor of 2.7. The most precise m t measurement by D0 experiment based on this method was performed in \u2113+jets analysis [1,2]. The CMS Collaboration has applied a different approach for measuring m t in the dilepton channel, obtaining a precision of 1.23 GeV [4]. This measurement uses the entire data set accumulated by the D0 experiment during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 . We use the final D0 jet energy scale (JES) corrections and the refined corrections of the b quark jet energy scale [14]. The measurement is performed with a blinded approach, as described in Section IV. Similarly to the recent top mass measurement in the dilepton final state using a neutrino weighting technique [15], we correct jet energies by a calibration factor obtained in the top quark mass measurement in the \u2113+jets analysis [1,2].",

More than 90% of the energy of an electron candidate must be deposited in the electromagnetic part of the calorimeter. The electron is required to be isolated by demanding that less than 20% of its energy is deposited in an annulus of 0.2 < R < 0.4 around its direction.

The transverse momenta of electrons (p e T ) must be greater than 15 GeV. In addition, we use a multivariate discriminant based on tracking and calorimeter information to reject jets misidentified as electrons.

Reconstructed muons must have p T > 15 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2, and satisfy the two following isolation criteria. First, the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter annulus 0.1 < R < 0.4 around the muon (E \u00b5,iso T ) must be less than 15% of the transverse momentum of the muon (p \u00b5 T ). Secondly, the sum of the transverse momenta of the tracks in a cone of radius R = 0.5 around the muon track in the central tracking system (p \u00b5,iso T ) must be less than 15% of p \u00b5 T . Jets are identified as energy clusters in the electromagnetic and hadronic parts of the calorimeter, reconstructed using an iterative mid-point cone algorithm with radius R = 0.5 [24]. An external JES correction is determined by calibrating the energy deposited in the jet cone using transverse momentum balance in exclusive photon+jet and dijet events in data [14]. When a muon track overlaps the jet cone, twice the p T of the muon is added to the jet p T , assuming that the muon originates from a semileptonic decay of a hadron belonging to the jet and that the neutrino has the same p T as the muon. In addition, we use the difference in single-particle responses between data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to provide a parton-flavor dependent JES correction [14]. This correction significantly reduces the bias in the jet energy and the total JES uncertainty of the jets initiated by b quarks. Jet energies in simulated events are also corrected for residual differences in energy resolution and energy scale between data and simulation. These correction factors are measured by comparing data and simulation in Drell\u2212Yan (Z/\u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 ee) events with accompanying jets [14].",

The detector transfer functions (TF), W (x, y), correspond to the probability for reconstructing parton four-momenta y as the final-state observables x. The term d\u03a6 6 represents the six-body phase space, and \u03c3 obs (m t ) is the tt cross section observed at the reconstruction level, calculated using the matrix element M (y, m t ), corrected for selection efficiency. The LO matrix element M (y, m t ) for the processes qq \u2192 tt \u2192 W + W \u2212 bb \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 \u03bd \u2113\u03bd\u2113 bb is used in our calculation [40] and it contains a Breit-Wigner function to represent each W boson and top quark mass. The matrix element is averaged over the colors and spins of the initial state partons, and summed over the colors and spins of the final state partons. The gg matrix element is neglected, since it comprises only 15% of the total tt production crosssection at the Tevatron. Including it does not significantly improve the statistical sensitivity of the method. The electron momenta and the directions of all reconstructed objects are assumed to be perfectly measured and are therefore represented through \u03b4 functions, \u03b4(x \u2212 y), reducing thereby the dimensionality of the integration. This leaves the magnitues of the jet and muon momenta to be modelled. Following the same approach as in the previous measurement [39], we parametrize the jet energy resolution by a sum of two Gaussian functions with parameters depending linearly on parton energies, while the resolution in the curvature of the muon (1/p \u00b5 T ) is described by a single Gaussian function. All TF parameters are determined from simulated tt events. We use the same parametrizations for the transfer functions as in the \u2113+jets m t measurement.

The LO (Z/\u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 \u2113\u2113)+2 jets ME from the vecbos generator [45] is used in this analysis. In the e\u00b5 channel, background events are produced through the (Z/\u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113\u2113)+2 jets processes. Since Z/\u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays are not implemented in vecbos, we use an additional transfer function to describe the energy of the final state lepton relative to the initial \u03c4 lepton, obtained from parton-level information [41]. As for P tt (x, m t ), the directions of the jets and charged leptons are assumed to be well-measured, and each kinematic solution is weighted according to the p T of the Z/\u03b3 \u22c6 + jets system. The integration of the probability P bkg (x) is performed over the energies of the two partons initiating the selected jets and both possible assignments of jets to top quark decays.",
