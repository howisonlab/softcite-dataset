The possible causes of the structure are analyzed in this work, along with the different experimental approaches developed to identify its origin. Considering the available data and results from the three experiments, the most likely explanation concerns the reactor flux predictions and the associated uncertainties.

            "text": "In the last two decades, several neutrino oscillation experiments [1] have demonstrated that neutrinos are massive particles. Thus, neutrinos have become a main probe to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the three neutrino paradigms, the neutrino oscillation probability can be described by three mixing angles ( 12 , 23 , 13 ), two independent mass square differences (\u0394 2 21 , \u0394 2 31 ), and one phase CP responsible for the CP-violation in the leptonic sector. While the dominant oscillations driven by 12 and 23 have been measured by different experiments in the so-called solar and atmospheric sectors, the third mixing angle 13 remained unrevealed until very recently. The first direct indication of a nonzero value of this angle has come from the accelerator-based experiments MINOS [2] and T2K [3]. However, the current accelerator neutrino experiments cannot measure 13 independently of other oscillation parameters. Complementing the role of acceleratorbased facilities, reactor neutrino experiments stand as the direct way to provide an accurate value of 13 . In a twoflavor scheme and for short baselines ( \u223c 2km), the survival probability of a reactor electron antineutrino ] with energy ] can be described as",

            "text": "The value of 13 can be measured directly from the oscillation amplitude, inferred from an energy-dependent deficit in the number of observed neutrinos. After a series of short-and medium-baseline (\u223c100-1000 m) reactor neutrino experiments carried out in 80 s and 90 s, a new generation of experiments has been operating for the past few years. Three different collaborations (Daya Bay [4], Double Chooz [5], and RENO [6]) have reported very precise measurements of the mixing angle 13 . As these experiments rely partially on the comparison of the observed antineutrino flux with respect to the expected one, a revision of the relatively old reactor flux models was performed in [7,8], becoming the new references and reducing the uncertainties at the 3% level. This reevaluation of the flux led to the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly [9], pointing at a possible short-baseline oscillation that would imply the existence of at least one sterile neutrino. While this suggests a possible underestimation of the reactor flux uncertainties, it does not impact the determination of 13 . Beyond this anomaly, Daya Bay, Double Chooz, and RENO have reported very recently [5,[10][11][12] an energy distortion around 5 MeV, which deviates from the expectation at about 3-4 . Apart from reinforcing the idea of an underestimation of the flux errors, this experimental result has induced a world-wide effort in trying to understand the origin of this discrepancy. This work reviews the observation of such a 5 MeV energy structure by the three current reactor experiments. The possible causes are described as well as the different experimental approaches carried out to identify its origin. The incompleteness of the reactor flux predictions is presented as the most likely explanation, so the different models developed so far are reviewed. Within those models, a number of possible sources of biases or error underestimations are listed, thus pointing at possible experimental ways to improve our current knowledge. This review is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the current ] reactor experiments, relying on the flux predictions presented in Section 3; the observation of the energy distortion is reported in Section 4, followed by a critical analysis of its possible origin in Section 5; the reactor flux models are revisited in Section 6 as the most likely cause; finally, Section 7 summarizes the state of the art and discusses the experimental data required to gain further knowledge on the ] reactor flux and the origin of the energy structure.",

The accidental background stands for the random coincidence of a positron-like signal coming from natural radioactivity and the capture in the detector of a neutron created by Advances in High Energy Physics 3 cosmic muon spallation in the surrounding materials. The correlated background consists of events which may mimic both the prompt and the delayed signals of the IBD. Along with the stopping muons, the fast neutrons and cosmogenic isotopes, both generated in muon interactions, are the main sources of this background. Fast neutrons entering the detector lead to proton recoils, thus faking a prompt signal, before being captured. Muons crossing the detector can produce long-lived -decay isotopes, like 9 Li and 8 He.

In order to reduce them, a relative comparison between two or more identical detectors located at different distances from the reactors becomes critical. As originally proposed in [13], a near detector placed a few hundred meters away can measure the fluxes before any oscillation takes place. The comparison between the far and near detectors leads to a breakthrough in the sensitivity to 13 , as all the fully correlated systematic uncertainties cancel out.

As the unstable fission products are rich in neutrons, they undergo decays generating a nearly pure electron antineutrino flux. Only four isotopes, whose fission products can produce ] with energies above the IBD threshold (1.8 MeV), contribute to more than 99% of the flux: 235 U, 239 Pu, 238 U, and 241 Pu. However, such a flux consists of a superposition of thousands of -decay branches. A fraction of the neutrons produced in the 235 U fissions is captured by 238 U, giving place to mostly 239 Pu. Thus, the core burns 235 U while accumulating 239 Pu as it is operated, in the so-called burn-up process. Apart from these two main isotopes which make up about 90% of the flux, the 241 Pu and 238 U fissions contribute to the remaining 10%. From a practical point of view, this implies that an accurate reactor flux prediction relies on two main aspects: (1) the simulation of the time evolution of the core fuel composition (i.e., the contributions of each one of the four main isotopes) and (2) the knowledge of the spectra associated to the decay chains of the fission products.",

The ab initio or summation method takes advantage of the available information on the decays of each fission fragment (nuclear databases), summing over each nuclide's individual spectrum to obtain aggregate spectra. On the other hand, the so-called conversion method exploits the aggregate spectra measured in the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) [23][24][25][26], fitting the data to a set of virtual branches and converting the result into the corresponding antineutrino spectra (e.g., [27]). While it is worth noticing that both methods rely on measured spectra, the conversion approach yields the most precise results since the uncertainties are constrained by the ILL measurements. Although this is reviewed in this work, the errors associated with the conversion method have been claimed to be at the level of 2-3%. As the nuclear databases are known to suffer from a lack of relevant data (concerning both decays and fission yields) and from the need of more precise measurements, the summation method provides typically an envelope error of about 10-20%. Recently, there have been improvements in both the conversion and summation techniques [7,28], being one of the main goals to optimize the results from the current reactor experiments.",

Suchspectra were obtained at ILL by irradiating thin target foils of these isotopes with thermal neutrons. As 238 U nuclei undergo fission with fast neutrons, the associated spectrum could not be measured at that time and therefore its prediction has been typically based on the summation method. The same applies to all spectra above 8 MeV, as the ILL measurements were performed only up to this energy. In [7], a mixed approach has been developed combining the precise reference of the electron spectra from ILL with the physical distribution of beta branches of all fission products provided by the nuclear databases. This new analysis has provided a better handle on the systematic errors of the conversion and a new set of reference spectra for 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and 238 U (although the latter is still based on a purely summation technique). While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are found to be comparable to those of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3% on average, thus leading to the reactor neutrino anomaly. The reevaluation of short-baseline reactor data in the light of these new reference spectra reveals a deficit in the number of observed antineutrinos, which might be explained in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations. One of the main reasons for this normalization shift is the treatment of the corrections ( , , ) in (7), and in particular the WM term. These corrections have been further investigated in [8], deriving a consistent set of reference spectra in both shape and normalization. To complete the picture of the state-of-the-art conversion method, it must be noticed that the cumulative spectrum of the fission products of 238 U has been finally measured in [29], in the range from 2.875 MeV to 7.625 MeV.",

To start with, this approach provides estimations of the reference spectra which are independent from the measurements at ILL. As these measurements are unique, a cross-check based on nuclear databases is specially valuable. The summation method is also the only way to predict the antineutrino energy spectra beyond 8.0 MeV for 235 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu, and beyond 7.6 MeV for 238 U. While it is true that some authors (e.g., [7,8]) have provided polynomial parameterizations of the spectra that can be used to extrapolate the predictions above 8 MeV (as typically  Figure 2: Ratio of summation-derived spectra (from [28]) to the start-of-the-art conversion-derived spectra (from [8,29]), as a function of the ] energy. The shadowed band shows the 1 error. done by reactor experiments), such an extrapolation is not physically motivated and the associated error cannot be estimated in a robust way. Furthermore, the binning of 250 keV in which the ILL spectra were originally published is large enough to hide possible structures coming from some contributions to the reactor fluxes. Taking into account all these considerations, the summation technique has become a main tool to shed light on the reactor antineutrino spectra and the nuclear databases have been recently improved by new -decay measurements. In particular, a new set of reference energy spectra has been obtained in [28] taking into account the new measurements of the 102;104;105;106;107 Tc, 105 Mo, and 101 Nb nuclei. These measurements are taken with the Total Absorption Technique (TAS), insensitive to the Pandemonium effect [30] which typically affects the spectrometry with Ge detectors. Beyond the relevant improvement in the summation-based reference spectra, the work in [28] highlights the need of new TAS measurements.",

In Neutrino 2014, both RENO and Double Chooz collaborations reported and quantified such an excess [11,12,32]. Daya Bay also presented a similar energy structure at the ICHEP 2014 and at NuTel 2015 [33] conferences.  The first journal publication of this effect has been provided by Double Chooz in [5]. Using the data from the far detector, a best fit value of the flux normalization of 9 \u00b1 2% (with respect to the central value prediction) is quoted between 4.25 and 6 MeV. This translates into a significance of 3 . The energy distortion is consistent with the ones presented in previous Double Chooz publications [34][35][36], where a significant measurement of the data-prediction discrepancy was not possible due to the limited statistics and the nonoptimized detector energy response. Daya Bay has also released a paper [10] on the reactor neutrino flux measurement, concerning both the normalization and the energy spectrum. The measured prompt energy spectrum in the near detectors shows a deviation from the reactor models with a significance beyond 2 over the full energy range, and around 4 between 4 and 6 MeV. The excess in this energy range has been estimated to be about 1% of all events in both the near and far detectors. Once corrected by the 13 oscillation effect, the energy spectra measured in the near and far detectors are consistent. Two reactor predictions have been considered in Daya Bay, one based on the conventional ILL models and another one based on the reevaluations provided in [7,8].",

The excess reported by the three collaborations amounts to about 10% over the expected number of ] in this energy range, and both RENO and Daya Bay have observed consistent structures in their near and far detectors. It might be argued that the excess observed in RENO is larger than in Daya Bay and Double Chooz. However, given the discrepancy between RENO and Daya Bay in the 2-4 MeV range (see Figure 3), such a difference in the amplitude of the distortion might be due to differences in the flux predictions beyond the 4-6 MeV window. In order to compare the observed distortions in a robust and quantitative way, the ] prediction of the three reactor experiments should be based on the same reactor model (which comprises not only the reference spectra ( ), but also the simulation of the reactor core evolution, the treatment of the spent fuel, etc.). It is also worth noticing that the significance of the excess quoted by the three experiments cannot be directly Advances in High Energy Physics 7 compared, as they are computed in different ways. Daya Bay normalizes the predicted spectrum to the observed number of events, thus evaluating the discrepancy in terms of the energy spectrum between 4 and 6 MeV, and not the total rate. On the other hand, Double Chooz performs an evaluation based on the total predicted and expected rates in the 4.25-6.00 MeV energy window. Independently of how the distortion significance is estimated, it is limited by the uncertainties in the flux prediction, which are at the level of 2-3% for both the rate and the spectral shape.",

There are however two differences. Firstly, Double Chooz uses in [5] the measurement in [29] to derive the 238 U ] spectrum, while Daya Bay and RENO take the summation-based spectrum from [7]. Secondly, Double Chooz constrains the flux normalization to the measurement in Bugey4 [37], taken 15 m away from the core. This is why Double Chooz quotes a flux normalization error of 1.7%, thus reducing the errors in Daya Bay and RENO (2.7% and 2.0%, resp.). Beyond this, Daya Bay has also explored some variations to the reference model but concluded that the structure still remains. In particular, the local distortion around 5 MeV cannot be described extending the reactor model with a single -branch or a monoenergetic line.",

In the case of Daya Bay and RENO, whose analyses involve both near and far detectors, the impact of the energy structure is even smaller as the role of the flux prediction is not as relevant due to the interdetector comparison.",

In particular, it has been observed by Daya Bay and RENO at two different baselines (the near and far detectors). Therefore, it can be assumed that the discrepancy between the data and the flux models might be due to one of these reasons: (1) the existence of nonstandard IBD interactions, (2) a detection issue distorting the energy scale, (3) an unaccounted background source, and (4) missing contributions to the reactor models. Being the reactor ] spectrum uncertainty of the order of 2-3% and the maximum deviation between data and prediction around 10%, the current reactor experiments cannot establish this discrepancy beyond a significance of \u223c4 . However, the available data allow for a dedicated analysis on the possible causes of the discrepancy. The current reactor experiments have been capable of reinforcing the case for a reactormodel explanation, while disfavoring other possible causes, namely, the misinterpretation of the detector response and the incompleteness of the background model. The dedicated studies addressing the possible sources of the prompt energy spectrum distortion are described below.",

This kind of trend can hardly explain a bump-like excess around 5 MeV in the positron energy spectrum. Within the target volume of the detectors, the antineutrinos can interact basically with H, C, and Gd and in the -catcher only with H and C. As Double Chooz has observed the energy structure using neutrons captures in Gd and in H [36], an unaccounted interaction with Gd can be excluded. The antineutrinos might interact with some C isotope with enough energy to separate one neutron, the final nuclei remaining in excited state. The combination of the deexcitation and the neutron might mimic the IBD signal.

Such a correlation has been demonstrated by Daya Baya, Double Chooz, and RENO, by estimating the excess for different reactor powers.

This result is consistent with the reported correlation between the excess and the thermal power, thus reinforcing the case for a flux model bias and disfavoring again the background model as the source of the energy distortion.

To start with, the errors of the conversion-based reference spectra must be reevaluated somehow, as the current quoted uncertainties do not cover the observed energy distortion. This is obviously related to the identification of the possible missing pieces in the reactor models. Such contributions in the conversion-based flux might be related to (1) the aggregate measurements, (2) the conversion procedure itself, and (3) the nuclear corrections, mostly related to the forbidden decays.

            "text": "The uncertainties quoted in [7] have been revisited in [14], since they lead to a significance of the reactor neutrino anomaly of about 3 . As described in Section 3, an antineutrino spectrum can be estimated from a beta spectrum if the linear combination of operators involved in the decay, the endpoint energy, and the nuclear charge is known. However, the fission spectra involve about 6000 decays, being forbidden about 30% of them. This implies that some assumptions are needed when deriving the reactor ] flux, given the limited knowledge on the structure of the forbidden transitions. Such assumptions affect eventually the error budget of the predictions in both the conversion and summation methods. In [14], it has been noticed that different treatments of the forbidden transitions (and the associated corrections) can lead to antineutrino spectra that differ in both shape and magnitude at about 4%. In particular, if all forbidden decays are treated as allowed transitions, the antineutrino spectra are increased, thus leading to the reactor neutrino anomaly reported in [9]. However, this is not always the case if different approaches for the forbidden transitions are adopted. It is concluded that uncertainties in the ] predictions are about 4%, implying an increase of roughly a factor 2 with respect to the estimations in [7,8]. Along the same lines, the effect of first forbidden transitions on the -decay neutrino spectra is analyzed in [42] by performing microscopic nuclear structure calculations. The authors conclude that these decays may be responsible for a fraction of the deficit of neutrinos observed in the reactor experiments. Although the works in [14,42] are addressing the issue of the reactor neutrino anomaly, the conclusions apply also to the energy structure observed around 5 MeV: the disagreement between the data and the flux prediction might be due to the forbidden transitions contributing to that energy region.",

Second, the shape factor ( ) is not the same for all forbidden transitions: in [7], the ( ) corresponding to a unique forbidden transition has been assumed for all the cases.

However, it is worth remarking that the errors associated to this technique are too large to establish any conclusion. Furthermore, the use of different databases can lead to somehow different conclusions. As an example, the ENDF/B.VII.1 compiled nuclear data [43] has been used in [40] to derive the ] spectra, yielding an energy bump in the antineutrino energy in the 5-7 MeV region ( = 4-6 MeV). However, the ENDF/B.VII.1 data used in the analysis is not taking into account the new TAS measurements described in [28]. By using the reference spectra from [28] or the ENDF/B.VII.1 database combined with the new TAS measurements (hereafter updated ENDF/B.VII.1) [44], the bump is significantly reduced. A detailed comparison of the updated ENDF/B.VII.1 and JEFF-3.11 [45] decay libraries has been presented in [41]: in the case of the JEFF-3.11-based results, the bump is totally removed. Finally, it must be noticed that the same kind of limitations of the available nuclear data arises when considering the reactor neutrino anomaly (i.e., the flux normalization). As an example, Daya Bay has measured an absolute ] rate in good agreement with the current world average and with the ENDF/B-VII.1 prediction (i.e., no indication of anomaly). However, comparing the Daya Bay data with the JEFF-3.1.1 estimations yields a deficit in the ] rate, thus suggesting the anomaly.",

The structure is observed in the near detectors of Daya Bay and RENO (with baselines around 300 m) and in the far detectors of the three experiments (with baselines around 1-2 km), so it cannot be explained in terms of any standard neutrino oscillations.
