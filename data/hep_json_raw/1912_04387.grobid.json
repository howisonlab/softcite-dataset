            "text": "In the chiral limit of zero quark masses, the \u03b1 S coupling is the only free parameter of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. Because of its logarithmic decrease with energy (asymptotic freedom), \u03b1 S is commonly given at a reference scale, often taken at the Z pole mass. Its current value, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1181 \u00b1 0.0011, is known with a \u00b10.9% uncertainty, making it the least precisely known of all interaction couplings in nature [1]. The precision of the strong coupling value plays an important role in all theoretical calculations of perturbative QCD (pQCD) processes involving partons, and currently leads to 3-7% uncertainties in key Higgs boson processes, such as the cross sections for gluon-gluon fusion (gg \u2192 H) and associated production with a top quark pair (ttH), as well as the H \u2192 bb, cc, gg partial decay widths [2]. As one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model (SM), the uncertainties of the QCD coupling value also dominate the propagated parametric uncertainties in the theoretical calculations of the top quark mass [3], as well as of electroweak (EW) precision observables [4]. Last but not least, \u03b1 S also impacts physics approaching the Planck scale, JHEP06 2020  Table 1.

The current \u03b1 S (m Z ) world-average value is derived from a combination of six subclasses of (mostly) independent observables measured at various energy scales, which are compared with pQCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), or beyond, accuracy [1]. The only hadron collider observable so far that provides a constraint on \u03b1 S at this level of theoretical accuracy is the total tt cross section [8][9][10]. One of the paths towards improvement of our knowledge of the QCD coupling is the inclusion into the world average of new independent observables sensitive to \u03b1 S that are experimentally and theoretically known with high precision [11,12]. Charged-and neutral-current Drell-Yan processes in their leptonic decay modes, pp \u2192 W \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u03bd and pp \u2192 Z \u2192 + \u2212 with \u00b1 = e \u00b1 , \u00b5 \u00b1 , are the most accurately known processes currently accessible in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. Experimentally, the uncertainties in the inclusive V = W \u00b1 , Z production cross sections measured by the CMS experiment are between 3 and 5%; these are dominated by the integrated luminosity uncertainty, whereas the statistical uncertainties are at the subpercent level (table 1)  [13,14]. On the theoretical side, the corresponding cross sections are known at NNLO pQCD accuracy [15], with about 1-4% parton distribution function (PDF), and 0.3-1.3% scale uncertainties [16]. Electroweak corrections, which lead to a few percent reduction of the pure-pQCD W \u00b1 and Z boson production cross sections, are known at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy [17].",

            "text": "Theoretical calculations [18] indicate that about one fourth of the total V production cross sections at LHC energies come from partonic processes beyond the Born level, and thereby depend on the QCD coupling value. By calculating the V production cross sections at NNLO for varying \u03b1 S (m Z ) values, and by comparing the theoretical predictions to experimental data, one can therefore derive a value of the strong coupling constant at the Z pole, independent of other current extractions [19]. By combining such a result with those derived from other methods, the overall uncertainty in the \u03b1 S (m Z ) world average -2 -JHEP06(2020)018 can eventually be reduced. The use of inclusive W \u00b1 , Z boson cross sections to extract the QCD coupling is presented here for the first time. This method is similar to the one used to extract \u03b1 S from the inclusive tt cross sections at hadron colliders [8][9][10], except that the underlying physical process is quite different. Whereas \u03c3(tt) depends on \u03b1 S already at leading order (LO), albeit with \u22485% theoretical and experimental uncertainties, \u03c3(V) is more precisely known experimentally and theoretically, although at the Born level its underlying partonic processes are purely EW with a dependence on \u03b1 S that comes only through higher-order pQCD corrections (at LO, the \u03c3(V) cross sections also depend on \u03b1 S via the PDFs).",

Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet. Muons with p T > 20 or 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1 are selected in the analyses. Details of the CMS detector and its performance can be found elsewhere [20].",

            "text": "where the functions f i represent the PDFs of each proton, determined from experimental data, and the expression in brackets is the perturbative expansion of the underlying partonic cross sections\u03c3. At hadron colliders, the LO production of W \u00b1 and Z bosons involves the annihilation of a quark-antiquark pair of the same (qq \u2192 Z + X) or different (qq \u2192 W + X) flavour. At NLO, the Born terms are supplemented with initial-state real gluon emission, virtual gluon exchange, and contributions from gluon-quark and gluonantiquark scattering processes. At NNLO, additional gluon radiation and virtual exchanges further contribute to the total cross section [15,18]. Although at LO the partonic cross sections are independent of \u03b1 S , the vertices of the higher-order terms introduce a dependence on \u03b1 S that enables the determination of the QCD coupling by comparing high-precision theoretical calculations to the experimental data. The size of such higher-order corrections [19], encoded in the so-called K-factor, amounts to K = \u03c3 nnlo /\u03c3 lo \u2248 1.25-1.37 as derived with mcfm v.8.0 [16] for the W \u00b1 and Z cross sections measured at 7 and 8 TeV in the CMS fiducial acceptance, and indicates that EW boson production is indeed sensitive to \u03b1 S (m Z ) at NNLO accuracy. In this work, the NNLO cross sections are computed with the mcfm code interfaced with lhapdf v.6.1.6 [22] to access four different PDFs: CT14 [23], HERAPDF2.0 [24], MMHT14 [25], and NNPDF3.0 [26]. All these PDFs use as the default central set the one with the QCD coupling constant fixed to \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 in their global fits of the data, but also provide a variety of alternative sets with their corresponding central values derived for different fixed values of \u03b1 S (m Z ). We note, however, that when the QCD coupling constant is left free in their NNLO PDF fits, the following values are preferred by the different PDF sets: \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.115 (CT14) [23], 0.108 (HERAPDF2.0) [24], and 0.1172 (MMHT2014) [25]. The HERAPDF2.0 set is obtained from fits to HERA deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data only. The CT14, MMHT14, and NNPDF3.0 global fits have been obtained including DIS, fixed target, and LHC measurements. These latter PDF sets incorporate one or two W \u00b1 or Z differential CMS distributions at 7 TeV [13] in their global fits, but did not use any of the twelve absolute inclusive EW boson cross sections listed in table 1, and therefore the corresponding values of \u03b1 S extracted here are truly independent of the data contributing to the extraction of PDF sets themselves. The so-called G \u00b5 electroweak scheme, where the input parameters are m W , m Z , and G F , is used in all the predictions. The leptonic W and Z branching fractions are obtained in mcfm from the theoretical leptonic width (computed at LO in electroweak accuracy) normalized to the total W and Z widths experimentally measured [1]. All numerical results have been obtained using the latest SM parameters for particle masses, widths, and couplings [1]. For simplicity, the default value of the charm quark mass in mcfm and NNPDF3.0, m c = 1.275 GeV,",

For e \u00b1 final states, we follow the \"calorimetric\" prescription, proposed in theoretical W \u00b1 and Z boson production cross section benchmarking studies at the LHC [27], and recombine any radiated photon with the e \u00b1 if their relative distance in the pseudorapidity-azimuth plane is \u2206R = (\u03b7 e \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3 ) 2 + (\u03c6 e \u2212 \u03c6 \u03b3 ) 2 < 0.1. For \u00b5 \u00b1 final states, we use directly the \"bare\" mcsanc cross section. We run mcsanc at NLO with EW corrections on and off, and compute the corresponding multiplicative factor K EW = \u03c3(nlo,ew on)/\u03c3(nlo,ew off), which is used to correct the pQCD mcfm results. The EW corrections, in the range of 1-4%, are all negative, i.e. they reduce the overall cross section with respect to the pure pQCD result. Since the EW corrections are small, their associated uncertainties are neglected hereafter because they would propagate into the final computed W \u00b1 and Z cross section at a few per mille level, below the numerical uncertainty of the mcfm calculation. Subtracting the EW corrections, rather than applying them multiplicatively via a K EW factor as done here, gives consistent results within the (neglected) per mille uncertainties. For simplicity, in the mcsanc calculations, the electron pseudorapidity range 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.57 (excluded in the actual measurements) is also included, since we are interested in the relative correction, this small range (present in both the numerator and denominator of the correcting factor) does not affect the K EW ratio. The roles of photon-induced contributions and of mixed QCD\u2295QED NLO corrections to Drell-Yan processes in pp collisions have been computed in refs. [28] and [29], respectively.

For each of the twelve experimental W \u00b1 and Z boson cross section measurements listed in table 1, we have computed their corresponding theoretical NNLO pQCD predictions using the four PDF sets and five to seven different values of \u03b1 S (m Z ). It is important to stress again that, for each QCD coupling constant, we use the specific PDF sets that are associated with that particular \u03b1 S (m Z ) value. We calculated the NLO EW corrections using NNPDF3.0 and \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118. By comparing the whole set of theoretical calculations to the experimental data, a preferred value of the QCD coupling constant can be derived for each PDF set as explained in the next section.

The mcfm numerical uncertainty cannot be neglected because differences with respect to the prediction computed with the central eigenvalue/replica members are used to calculate the PDF uncertainties. The cross sections for the central PDF members have intrinsic numerical fluctuations that impact the PDF uncertainty magnitude, asymmetry, and also the correlations among theoretical uncertainties. To take this into account, a Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for each pair of measurements and for each PDF set using the cross sections from all the PDF members that were used in calculating the PDF uncertainty. Similarly for the scale uncertainties, for each pair of measurements the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated using the results obtained from varying the theoretical scales. The correlations are mostly in the 0.8-0.9, 0.4-0.7, 0.2-0.6, and 0.9-1.0 ranges for CT14, HERAPDF2.0, MMHT14, and NNPDF3.0, respectively. The scale correlations are around 0.6-0.9. When combining the \u03b1 S (m Z ) estimates, the specific correlation coefficient calculated for every specific pair of estimates is used.    uncertainties amount to 2.0% for MMHT14 and NNPDF3.0, 2.3% for CT14, and \u22484% for HERAPDF2.0.

Although as discussed later, in the context of the cross-checks described in table 9, such a disagreement is reduced when symmetrising the HERAPDF2.0 uncertainties to their maximum values. As discussed before, since the HERAPDF2.0 cross sections for \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 tend to overpredict the measured W \u00b1 and Z boson production cross sections (figures 1-2), a datatheory agreement can only be obtained for a value of \u03b1 S that is reduced compared to its JHEP06(2020)018 default value. For all global PDF fits extracted with different \u03b1 S values as input, there exists a generic anticorrelation between the values of \u03b1 S (Q 2 ) and the parton densities evaluated at (x, Q 2 ), particularly, for the gluon and in turn (through perturbative evolution) for the sea quarks. It is thereby important to analyze in more detail the differences between the PDF sets for each flavour. For this purpose, a comparison study of parton densities and parton luminosities has been carried out with apfel v2.7.1 [34]. This study indicates that the HERAPDF2.0 u-quark densities (and the overall quark-antiquark luminosities) are enhanced by about 5% compared to the rest of PDFs in the (x, Q 2 ) region of relevance for EW boson production. This fact increases the weight of the LO contributions to the theoretical W \u00b1 and Z boson production cross sections, and thereby pushes down the cross section contributions from higher-order pQCD diagrams that are sensitive to \u03b1 S (m Z ). The effective result is a comparatively reduced \u03b1 S (m Z ) value. The level of agreement between the twelve individual and the total \u03b1 S (m Z ) extractions turns out to be good for this PDF set (\u03c7 2 /ndf \u2248 1 in table 8), because of the relatively wide span of \u03b1 S values derived and their associated large uncertainties (figure 3). Since HERAPDF2.0 uses DIS data alone, and therefore lacks the extra constraints on the PDFs provided by the LHC data, we conclude that one would need an updated refit of these parton densities to an extended set of experimental data, including LHC results, before relying on the QCD coupling constant derived following the procedure described here.",

            "text": "The features of the \u03b1 S (m Z ) results obtained with NNPDF3.0 show the opposite behaviour to those observed for the HERAPDF2.0 set. The W \u00b1 and Z boson production cross sections computed with this PDF tend to underpredict the experimental measurements (figures 1-2), and yield an overall bad data-theory agreement (\u03c7 2 /ndf \u2248 3 in table 5), for the baseline \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 coupling constant. A reproduction of the individual measurements by theory can thus be achieved only for an \u03b1 S (m Z ) value that is enlarged compared to the default value for this PDF set. Thus, many of the individual \u03b1 S (m Z ) extractions obtained with NNPDF3.0 have values relatively larger than those obtained for other PDFs. However, the final combined NNPDF3.0 value appears shifted down to \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1147 \u00b1 0.0023 (table 8), falling outside of the region around \u03b1 S (m Z ) \u2248 0.120 defined by most of the individual estimates (table 6), and, consequently, the final level of agreement of the combined and single extractions is poor (\u03c7 2 /ndf \u2248 3 in table 8). Such a seemingly counterintuitive behaviour is due to the presence of strong correlations among individual extractions for a fixed value of \u03b1 S (m Z ), and the fact that the lowest \u03b1 S (m Z ) values derived have smaller uncertainties than the rest, thereby pulling down the final average. The effect of a combined result lying outside of the range of the input values caused by, e.g. large underlying nonlinearities among individual estimates, is called \"Peelle's pertinent puzzle\" [35]. The absence of parametrisation bias in this neural-network PDF results in parton densities that can be less well constrained (have larger uncertainties) than the rest of PDFs in some regions of phase space. The same apfel v2.7.1 study mentioned above indicates that the NNPDF3.0 quark-antiquark luminosities tend to be somewhat less precise than those from the other PDF sets in the relevant (x, Q 2 ) range for W \u00b1 and Z production. A larger span of replicas results in nontrivial correlations among PDF uncertainties that push the final \u03b1 S (m Z ) value off the individual extractions for each single JHEP06 (2020)018measurement. In any case, the latest version released (v3.1) of the NNPDF global fit [36] shows much better agreement of the theoretical EW boson cross sections with the LHC data for the central \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 value. However, this latter NNPDF3.1 set cannot be directly employed to independently extract \u03b1 S (m Z ) from the CMS measurements through the approach discussed here, as this updated global fit does include already the absolute normalisation of a fraction of the W \u00b1 and Z cross sections used in this work.",

First, \u03b1 S (m Z ) values are extracted using separately the measurements at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV alone, as shown in the top rows of table 9. This separation of data sets yields final \u03b1 S (m Z ) values mostly consistent with those derived from the combined ones listed in table 8, with the largest deviations from the original results being those from the 7 TeV NNPDF3.0 and 8 TeV HERAPDF2.0 extractions, with 1.0 and 0.85 standard deviations, respectively. Although the CMS luminosity studies confirm that these uncertainties are fully uncorrelated between 7 and 8 TeV, we have checked the impact of relaxing such an assumption by assuming a 0.5 correlation factor between them. Such a correlation factor results in a change of the final \u03b1 S (m Z ) by at most one-third of the current total uncertainty. Another cross-check is carried out by symmetrising the PDF uncertainties to their maximum value of the two (this does not apply to NNPDF3.0, because its uncertainties are symmetric by construction). The corresponding results are given in the left bottom half of table 9. Changing from asymmetric to symmetric PDF uncertainties causes the HERAPDF2.0 combined value to increase by 1.1 standard deviation, whereas all other PDF results are consistent with the default \u03b1 S (m Z ) extractions. Such a large sensitivity to changes in the PDF uncertainty confirms the relative lack of robustness of the \u03b1 S (m Z ) values derived for HERAPDF2.0 in our analysis, because the asymmetries of the PDF uncertainties can be significantly affected by random numerical errors. To further test the sensitivity of the \u03b1 S (m Z ) extraction to the assumptions made on the underlying W \u00b1 and Z cross section uncertainties and their correlations, the original analysis is repeated by adding an uncorrelated 1% numerical uncertainty to all theoretical cross sections. Such a value accounts for possible overlooked small uncorrelated uncertainties, e.g. coming from the use of different codes for the theoretical pQCD and/or EW calculations [27]. The impact of such a change is not significant in the final results, as observed by comparing the numbers in table 8 and those in the bottom-right columns of table 9. Further similar tests and cross-checks have been carried out in a recent \u03b1 S (m Z ) extraction that exploits all the LHC electroweak boson data [40] with the same approach used here, which confirm these conclusions. All these systematic tests indicate that HERAPDF2.0 and NNPDF3.0 have larger variations when changing the ingredients of the combination, but for CT14 and MMHT14 the final \u03b1 S (m Z ) values extracted are reasonably robust within the quoted uncertainties.",

(5.1), compared to those obtained with HERAPDF2.0 and NNPDF3.0 (figures 1-2). Since the uncertainty in the \u03b1 S (m Z ) value derived from HERAPDF2.0 is the largest (up to twice as large as some of the other extractions), because of the absence of constraining LHC input data in this HERA-only PDF fit, and since the final NNPDF3.0 result has a larger tension between the combined and individual extractions from each single measurement (table 8), we consider the values extracted with CT14, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1163 +0.0024 \u22120.0031 , and MMHT14, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1186 \u00b1 0.0025, as the most reliable in this analysis. Providing a single final \u03b1 S (m Z ) value from this study is not obvious because, in general, there is no unique way to derive a final best estimate of \u03b1 S based on the results obtained from different PDF sets. An unbiased approach for combining results from different PDFs, in line with the PDG practice [1] as well as with the procedure employed to produce the PDF4LHC combined PDF set [37], is to average them without applying any further weighting. The same approach was followed also in the similar combination of QCD coupling constant values obtained from the inclusive tt cross sections [9]. By taking the straight average of the mean values and of the uncertainties of the individual CT14 and MMHT14 combinations, we obtain a final value of the QCD coupling constant at the Z pole mass, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1175 +0.0025 \u22120.0028 , with a total (symmetrised) uncertainty of 2.3%. Such a result compares very well with the \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1177 +0.0034 \u22120.0036 value, with an uncertainty of \u22483%, extracted from the theoretical analysis of top pair cross section data [9]. The right plot of figure 4 shows the \u03b1 S (m Z ) parabola extracted combining the CT14 and MMHT14 results. This final extraction is fully consistent with the PDG world average (orange band), and has an overall uncertainty similar to that of other recent determinations at this level of (NNLO) theoretical accuracy, such as those from EW precision fits [38], and tt cross sections [8][9][10].",
