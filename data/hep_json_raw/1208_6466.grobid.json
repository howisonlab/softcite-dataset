Such a search may shed light on the quantum numbers of the charmonium-like-particle or the internal dynamics of these states. In particular, it has been suggested that if the X(3872) is the 1 1 D 2 state \u03b7 c2 then the branching fraction B(X(3872) \u2192 \u03b7 c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) could be significantly larger than B(X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). The quantum numbers  the \u03b7 c2 are consistent with the results of an angular analysis of X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [12] and would allow production of X(3872) in two-photon fusion.

Since it is produced directly in e + e \u2212 annihilation it has J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 . The observation of the decay mode J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 [22] established that it has zero isospin. However it is not observed to decay to D * D * [23], nor to D * sD * s [24], so that its properties do not lend themselves to a simple charmonium interpretation, and its nature is still unclear. A subsequent Belle analysis [25] of the same final state suggested also the existence of an additional resonance around 4.1 GeV/c 2 that they dubbed the Y(4008). BABAR has performed recently a new analysis [26] of this process using 454 fb \u22121 . In this new study the region below 4.0 GeV /c 2 has been studied for the first time. As shown on Figure 4(a) in that region there is an excess of events above the J/\u03c8 sidebands background. To understand the nature of this contribution a detailed study of the \u03c8(2S) line shape has been performed and the results is that it is not possible to discount the possibility that its due to J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 continuum cross section in this region. Figure 4(a) shows the fit to the J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution. A clear signal for the Y(4260) is seen; the values obtained from an unbinned-maximumlikelihood fit are: m Y (4260) = 4244 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 4 MeV /c 2 , \u0393 Y (4260) = 114 +16 \u221215 \u00b1 7 MeV and \u0393 ee \u00d7 B(J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 9.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 0.7eV. There is no evidence for the Y(4008) seen by  Belle [25]. In the new BABAR analysis a detailed study of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system from the Y(4260) decay to J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 has been performed. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution shown on Figure  4(b) seems to peak around the f 0 (980) mass; however the peak is displaced from the nominal f 0 (980) position, since it is around 940 MeV /c 2 . The fact that the peak is displaced and the particular shape of m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution seems to suggest a possible interference between the f 0 (980) and m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) continuum. To test this possibility the f 0 (980) line shape is taken from the BABAR analysis of the D + S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + [27] and this amplitude as been used in a very simple model to describe the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution: | \u221a pol + e i\u03c6 F f 0 (980) | 2 where pol is a polynomial function used to describe the m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) continuum and F f 0 (980) is the amplitude from the D + S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + [27] analysis; \u03c6 allows for a phase difference between these amplitudes. The result of this study is shown on Figure 4(b) and indicates if there is a real f 0 (980) contribution to the decay of the Y(4260) to J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 its contribution is not dominant:",
