            "text": "Orbitally exited states of the D meson, denoted as D J , provide a unique opportunity to test Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). There are expected to be four P-wave states of positive parity with the quantum numbers 0 + ( j = 1/2), 1 + ( j = 1/2), 1 + ( j = 3/2) and 2 + ( j = 3/2), which are labeled as D * 0 , D 1 , D 1 and D * 2 , respectively, where j is the sum of the spin of the light quark and the angular momentum L. Conservation of parity and angular momentum restricts the final states and partial waves that are allowed in the decays of the various D J mesons. The resonances that decay through a D-wave are expected to be narrow (\u223c 30 MeV/c 2 ) and the resonances that decay through an S-wave are expected to be wide (a few hundred MeV/c 2 ). The D * 2 can only decay via a D-wave and the D * 0 can only decay via an S-wave. The D 1 and D 1 may decay via S-wave and D-wave. Fig. 1 shows the spectroscopy of the D-meson excitations and expected transitions. The Belle Collaboration has reported the first observation of the broad D * 0 and D 1 mesons in B decays [3]. However, the Particle Data Group [4] considers that the J and P quantum numbers of the D * 0 and D 1 states still need confirmation.",

Then we perform a Dalitz plot analysis to measure the exclusive branching fractions for B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 J \u03c0 \u2212 and to study the properties of the D J mesons. The decay B \u2212 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 is expected to be dominated by the intermediate states D * 2 \u03c0 \u2212 and D * 0 \u03c0 \u2212 and has a possible contribution from the B \u2212 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 non-resonant (NR) decay.

The \u2206E distribution is shown in Fig. 1. Continuum events are the dominant background. We suppress this background by restricting two topological variables: the magnitude of the cosine of the thrust angle, cos \u03b8 th , defined as the angle between the thrust axis of the selected B candidate and the thrust axis of the rest of the event; and the ratio of the second to zeroth Fox-Wolfram moment [5], R 2 . Small values of R 2 indicate a more spherical event shape (typical for BB events) while larger values indicate a 2-jet event topology (typical for qq events). We also place restrictions on m ES and \u2206E. Then we fit the \u2206E distribution to determine the fractions of signal and background events in the selected data sample. The result of the fit is shown in Fig. 1, it yields 3496 \u00b1 74 signal events. To distinguish signal and background in the Dalitz plot studies, we divide the candidates into three subsamples: the \u2206E signal region, and two \u2206E sidebands, all defined in Fig. 1. A background MC sample of resonant and continuum events is shown as the histogram in Fig. 1. There is a small amount of peaking, a fit yields 82 \u00b1 41 peaking events. The background subtracted number of signal events is N sig = 3414 \u00b1 85, resulting in the background fraction of (30.4 \u00b1 1.1) %.",

Analysis of the B \u2212 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot using the isobar model confirms the existence of a narrow D * 2 and a broad D * 0 resonance as predicted by HQET. The mass and width of D * 2 are determined to be m D * 2 = (2460.4 \u00b1 1.2(stat) \u00b1 1.2(syst) \u00b1 1.9(mod)) MeV/c 2 , \u0393 D * 2 = (41.8 \u00b1 2.5(stat) \u00b1 2.1(syst) \u00b1 2.0(mod)) MeV, while of the D * 0 they are: m D * 0 = (2297 \u00b1 8(stat) \u00b1 5(syst) \u00b1 19(mod)) MeV/c 2 , \u0393 D * 0 = (273 \u00b1 12(stat) \u00b1 17(syst) \u00b1 45(mod)) MeV, where the third uncertainty is related to the assumed composition of signal events and the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors.
