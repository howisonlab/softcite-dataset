In this system resonances can be probed via the four-wave mixing process in the vacuum. A search for scalar and pseudoscalar fields was performed by combining a 9.3 \u00b5J/0.9 ps Ti-sapphire laser and a 100 \u00b5J/9 ns Nd:YAG laser. No significant signal of four-wave mixing was observed. We provide the upper limits on the coupling-mass relation for scalar and pseudoscalar fields, respectively, at a 95% confidence level in the mass region below 0.15 eV.",

            "text": "Uncovering the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of the most crucial problems in modern physics. Low-mass and weakly coupling fields predicted by theoretical models in cosmology and particle physics can be candidates for such dark components. For instance, based on the scalar-tensor theory with the cosmological constant (STT ) [1], dark energy is interpreted as decaying while the universe becomes older due to the gravitational coupling between extremely light dilatons, a kind of scalar field (\u03c6), and matter fields. Observing the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 process with extremely high intensity laser fields can be a method of searching for \u03c6 in the laboratory [2]. The same approach can also be applied to searches for low-mass pseudoscalar fields (\u03c3 ), if the photon spin states are properly chosen [3]. The axion [4,5], a pseudoscalar field associated with the breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry [6], is a suitable candidate to which this method is directly applicable. The axion is supposed to be one of the most reasonable candidates for cold dark matter [7,8]. Therefore, these theoretical models strongly motivate us to search for such fields in the laboratory in general.",

In order to overcome low scattering amplitudes of \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c6/\u03c3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 processes due to weak coupling, we first utilize the character of the integrated resonance effect by capturing E CMS within E CMS via \u03b8 prepared by a creation laser field. Secondly, we let another laser field propagate into the optical axis common to the creation laser. This laser induces decay of resonance states into a specific energy-momentum space by the coherent nature of the inducing field. The scattering probability is thus proportionally increased by the number of photons in the inducing laser field [2,3,23,24].",

In the focused QPS, however, we must accept independent rotations of the incident p 1p 2 plane and the outgoing p 3p 4 plane as illustrated in Fig. A1 with respect to an experimentally given linear polarization plane. This implies that even if we supply \u03c9 as the pure {1}-state by a polarizer at the moment of plane wave propagation in advance of focusing, mixing of {1} and {2} states for randomly selected incident photon pairs is unavoidable while lasers are focused. Therefore, the focused QPS with a fixed initial linear polarization plane has sensitivity to both scalar and pseudoscalar fields simultaneously. We discuss this nature in detail in Appendix A. The relation in Eq. (2) is similar to \"four-wave mixing\" in matter corresponding to the third-order nonlinear quantum optical process in atoms [25,26]. Therefore, the observation of the four-wave mixing process in the vacuum may be interpreted as a replacement of the atomic nonlinear process by the exchange of unknown scalar or pseudoscalar fields. The observation of four-wave mixing in the vacuum is also used as a method for testing higher-order QED effects [27][28][29][30].",

The first search for scalar fields at QPS [22] was performed with weak intensity lasers, and thus the effect of the four-wave mixing process in atoms was negligible. In this experiment, however, four-wave mixing photons originating from the residual gas are anticipated due to much higher beam intensities. In this paper the method to obtain the exclusion limits in the search at QPS sensitive to both scalar and pseudoscalar fields is provided under the circumstance where a finite number of background photons must be evaluated.",

The incident photons to PBS are eventually observed by the common photo-device having relative time delay  of 23 ns. We use a single-photon-countable photomultiplier tube (PMT; R7400-01, manufactured by HAMAMATSU) as the photo-device. The repetition rate of the creation laser is 1 kHz and that of the inducing laser is 10 Hz by synchronizing the trigger with the 1 kHz creation pulsing. The data acquisition trigger of 20 Hz is synchronized with the 1 kHz creation laser pulsing which includes pedestal triggers in order to provide four patterns of triggers. The time coincidence between creation and inducing pulses is performed by adjusting the relative injection timing between the two lasers so that the relative time maximizes the four-wave mixing yield in the air. The shutter is placed on the creation laser beam line and it repeatedly opens and closes every 5 seconds. We acquire data with the four patterns of triggers, which are \"both lasers are incident (S),\" \"only the creation laser is incident (C),\" \"only the inducing laser is incident (I),\" and \"neither laser is incident (P).\" The digital oscilloscope recorded waveform data from the PMT and two photodiodes synchronized with the 20 Hz data acquisition trigger. The recorded waveform data from the PMT are sorted into the four types of trigger pattern: S, C, I, and P. The four trigger patterns are classified by checking the charge correlations between the waveform data from the two photodiodes for intensity monitoring.",

We search for negative peaks whose amplitude exceeds a given threshold. We then calculate charge sums of the peak structures. Figure 4 shows a sample of waveform data where peak structures are identified. Charge sums of peak structures are evaluated in units of the single-photon equivalent charge, \u22124.21 \u00d7 10 \u221214 C. There are some accidental noisy events among the recorded waveform data. In our analysis method, these noise structures could be misidentified as large photon-like peak structures. Therefore, it is necessary to remove such noisy events from the analyzed waveform data before counting photon-like peaks. We can identify noisy events by analyzing the frequencies of the waveforms. Noisy waveforms tend to have lower frequencies than those of normal waveforms. The frequencies are estimated by counting the number of nodes, which is defined as the intersections between a waveform and the average line of amplitudes within the 200 ns time window. The distributions of the number of nodes for each trigger pattern are shown in Fig. 5. We regard a waveform of which the number of nodes is lower than 150 as a noisy event in all trigger patterns by confirming that the differences of the distributions among four trigger patterns are not prominent.

They are inclusively evaluated by sampling the beam energies of the 640 nm calibration light at the focal point and the detection point, respectively, and taking the ratio between them. The matching of beam paths between the calibration light and four-wave mixing signals is ensured by adjusting the beam center of the calibration light with respect to those of the creation and inducing lasers at the near side and the far side of the focal spot, respectively. D is the signal detection efficiency of the PMT mainly caused by the quantum efficiency of the device. D is evaluated using a 532 nm pulse laser in advance of the search. We evaluate the absolute detection efficiency by splitting the 532 nm beam equally and taking the ratio between these energies. One is measured by a calibrated beam energy meter and the other is measured by the PMT with neutral density filters with measured attenuation factors. We then corrected the difference of the quantum efficiencies between the 532 nm and 641 nm lights by taking the relative quantum efficiencies provided by HAMAMATSU into account.",

The number of {1}-and {2}polarized signal-like photons are N S1 = 0 \u00b1 0 (stat.) \u00b1 2.16 (syst.I) \u00b1 0.30 (syst.II) \u00b1 0 (syst.III) and N S2 = 1.46 \u00b1 1.27 (stat.) \u00b1 2.16 (syst.I) \u00b1 0.04 (syst.II) \u00b1 3.59 (syst.III), respectively. We confirmed that the expected number of four-wave mixing photons in the residual gas is negligibly small by measuring the pressure dependence. As a result, no significant four-wave mixing signal is observed in this experiment. We obtained the upper limits on the coupling-mass relation for scalar and pseudoscalar fields at a 95% confidence level, respectively. The most sensitive coupling limits g/M = 5.24 \u00d7 10 \u22124 GeV \u22121 for scalar search and g/M = 5.42 \u00d7 10 \u22124 GeV \u22121 for pseudoscalar search are obtained at m = 0.15 eV.  in CMS. This implies that the simple summation factor 2\u03c0 on the azimuthal degree of freedom of the solid angle cannot be applied to QPS; instead, the \u03d5-dependent squared transition amplitude must be summed over the possible rotation \u03d5 from 0 to 2\u03c0 . We have already introduced this axially asymmetric factor F S with respect only to the incident reaction plane at \u03a6 = 0 in [3]. This factor essentially depends only on the second vertex factors above, while the incident plane rotation factor G is relevant only to the first vertex factors. We thus define the incident plane rotation factor as a weighted average with respect to F S at \u03a6 = 0 as follows:",

The difference is only a factor of two. The weight function W (\u03be ) of the kernel is almost unity for small a\u03be , that is, when a is small enough with a small mass and a weak coupling. Therefore, we will consider only the region of \u03be \u00b1 1 as a conservative estimate.

Figure A1 illustrates the relation between the experimentally defined linear polarization directions {1} and {2} and those theoretically defined (1) and (2). It also depicts the relations between the p 1p 2 and p 3p 4 planes with respect to the x-z plane, where the theoretically allowed coupling of an exchanged field to the linear polarization states can be evaluated in the clearest way. In Ref. [3], we have assumed the incident photons p 1 and p 2 are both plane waves with different wave vectors on the same reaction plane, which always ensures the clearest condition. In the general three-dimensional incident case such as a focused Gaussian beam, however, the p 1p 2 plane can rotate with respect to the x-z plane, which results in a deviation from the theoretically clearest condition. We therefore introduce a weighted averaging factor G over the clockwise rotation angle \u03a6 of the incident reaction plane with respect to the x-axis as follows.",

At a focused geometry of an incident laser beam, however, E CMS cannot be uniquely specified due to the momentum uncertainty of the incident waves. Although the incident laser energy has an intrinsic uncertainty, the momentum uncertainty or the angular uncertainty between a pair of incident photons dominates that of the incident energy. Therefore, we consider the case where only angles of incidence \u03d1 between randomly chosen pairs of photons are uncertain within 0 < \u03d1 \u2264 \u03d1 for a given focusing parameter by fixing the incident energy. The treatment for the intrinsic energy uncertainty is explained in detail in the Appendix B of Ref. [22]. We fix the laser energy \u03c9 at the optical wavelength",
