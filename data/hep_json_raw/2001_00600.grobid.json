An essentially stable state S is a potentially excellent Dark Matter candidate. We present the first search for a stable, doubly strange sixquark state in the decays of \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u039b\u039b. Based on a data sample of \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) decays collected by the BABAR Experiment we report the most recent results and set stringent limits on the existence of such exotic particle.",

A large binding energy might make S to be light enough that is stable or long lived. The spatial wavefunction of the S is completely symmetric that implies it should be the most tightly bound six-quark state of its class [4]. At the same time the color, spin wavefunctions, and flavor are totally asymmetric. The S is a spin 0, flavor-singlet, and parity-even boson with Q=0, B=2, and S=-2.",

If its mass m S < m p +m e +m \u039b = 2054.5 MeV, it decays via a doubly-weak interaction and its lifetime could be very long. A stable S is allowed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and would have eluded detection in both accelerator and non-accelerator experiments. So far such as bound state S has not been excluded by hypernuclei decays and direct searches for long-lived neutral state. The stable S has not been detected. It is difficult to distinguish the S kinematically from the neutron that attributes might explain why this state has escaped detector. The S does not couple to photon, pions, and most of other mesons because of its charge neutral and it has a flavor-singlet. The S is probably more compact than the ordinary baryons.",
