Here it is shown that if the X(3915) is the \u03c7c0(2P ), the measured strength of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 X(3915) signal implies an upper limit on the branching fraction B(\u03c7c0(2P ) \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8) < 7.8% that conflicts with a > 14.3% lower limit derived for the same quantity from the B \u2192 KX(3915) decay rate. Also, the absence any signal for X(3915) \u2192 D 0D0 in B + \u2192 K + D 0D0 decays is used to establish the limit B(X(3915) \u2192 D 0D0 < 1.2 \u00d7 B(X(3915) \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8). This contradicts expectations that \u03c7c0(2P ) decays to D 0D0 would be a dominant process, while decays to \u03c9J/\u03c8, which are Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka suppressed, would be relatively rare. These, plus reasons given earlier by Guo and Meissner, raise serious doubts about the X(3915) = \u03c7c0(2P ) assignment.",

            "text": "A number of meson candidates, dubbed the XY Z mesons, that contain charmed-quark anticharmed-quark (cc) pairs but do not match expectations for any of the unassigned levels of the cc charmonium spectrum have been observed in recent experiments. Some have non-zero electric charge [1] and cannot be accommodated in the spectrum of charmonium mesons, which are all electrically neutral. Others are neutral and have quantum numbers that are accessible by cc systems, but have properties that fail to match the tightly constrained expectations of any of the unassigned charmonium states [2]. To date, there is no compelling theoretical explanation for these XY Z mesons. Experimental observations of additional states and more refined measurements of properties of the existing states may eventually reveal patterns that give clues to their underlying structure. An important part of this program is a careful distinction of new states that are conventional charmonium mesons from those that are not. The X(3915) was observed by Belle as a near-threshold peak in the \u03c9J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution in exclusive B \u2192 K\u03c9J/\u03c8 decays [3]; it was subsequently confirmed by BaBar [4]. An \u03c9J/\u03c8 mass peak with similar mass and width was reported by Belle in the two-photon fusion process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8 in 2010 [5].",

In their paper [8], they present fits to both the Bellle and BaBar data that include a broad Breit Wigner (BW) function to represent the events under the \u03c7 \u2032 c2 peak. Their fits to both experiments' distributions give an average mass and width for the broad BW of M = 3837.6 \u00b1 11.5 MeV and \u0393 = 221 \u00b1 19 MeV that they attribute to the \u03c7 \u2032 c0 . This mass, the strong DD signal, and the absence of any sign of a similarly broad signal in the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8 distributions from Belle [5] and BaBar [6], insure that this candidate for the \u03c7 \u2032 c0 does not suffer from any of the difficulties listed above. However, in their fit, Guo and Meissner ignore possible feeddown to the DD from \u03c7 \u2032 c0 \u2192 DD * ;D * \u2192 D\u03c0(\u03b3), where the \u03c0 or \u03b3 is undetected. The DD events from this process would concentrate in a region that is about one pion mass below the \u03c7 \u2032 c0 peak and below the peak value from their fit. Since theoretical estimates of the \u03c7 \u2032 c0 \u2192 DD * give a rate that is in the range of 0.3 \u223c 0.5 times that for DD [11,12], this background would likely bias the Guo-Meissner fit to a lower mass value. With enough events, the strength of the DD * contribution could be determined from the number of D +D0 events in the data sample and a combined study of neutral and charged DD * pairs could remove such a bias [17]. This could be done at BelleII [18].",

Here there is a clear excess of events above the non-J/\u03c8 and/or non-DD backgrounds that are reliably determined from J/\u03c8 and D mass sideband data and shown as a hatched histogram. Chao suggested that this event excess is due to the \u03c7 \u2032 c0 [21]. The Belle fit to this excess, shown in the figure as a solid curve, returned a signal with a statistical significance of 3.8\u03c3 and a mass and width of M = 3878 \u00b1 48 MeV and \u0393 = 347 +316 \u2212143 MeV, which are consistent with the Guo-Meissner fit values discussed above. However, since the Belle fit was unstable under variations of the background parameterization and and the bin width, they made no claims for an observation.

In a detailed study of one of the XY Z states (the Z c (3900)) in the context of a QCD-tetraquark picture, partial widths for hadronic decays to hidden-charm states are found to be much larger than those for decays to open-charmed mesons [29].

However, a specific model by Molina and Oset finds a 0 ++ (mostly) D * D * bound state with mass and width M = 3943 MeV and \u0393 = 17 MeV that couples strongly to \u03c9J/\u03c8 and weakly to DD [31], properties that match reasonably well to those of the X(3915).
