These secondary mesons can either interact in further collisions in the atmosphere or decay to produce atmospheric muons. Precision measurements of the muon charge ratio, R \u00b5 \u2261 N \u00b5 + /N \u00b5 \u2212 , in cosmic rays can be used to improve models of the interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Single-muon and multiple-muon events provide complementary information that feeds into the development of these models. In addition, measurements of the cosmic ray muon charge ratio from a few GeV to a few TeV are important for constraining calculations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes. These are of interest both for detailed measurements of neutrino oscillations in atmospheric neutrino experiments and also for calculations of backgrounds for neutrino telescopes. The muon charge ratio is a particularly useful tool for testing the predicted atmospheric \u03bd/\u03bd ratio.",

            "text": "Single-muon charge ratio measurements performed by MINOS (Near Detector) [1], L3+C [2], Bess-TeV [3], CosmoALEPH [4] and CMS [5] at surface-level energies, E \u00b5 , ranging from a few hundred MeV to 100 GeV are consistent with the 2001 world average of 1.268 \u00b1 [0.008 + 0.0002 E \u00b5 /GeV] [6]. This apparent constancy over three orders of magnitude in muon energy can be interpreted as a consequence of Feynman scaling [7]. At TeV surface energies, MINOS (Far Detector) [8] and OPERA [9] reported higher values for the muon charge ratio, 1.374\u00b10.004 (stat.) +0.012 \u22120.010 (syst.) and 1.377\u00b1 0.006 (stat.) +0.007 \u22120.001 (syst.), respectively. The atmospheric muon charge ratio for single muons is not unity because the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, which have a preponderance of u quarks, favoring the production of a leading \u03c0 + or K + over \u03c0 \u2212 and K \u2212 . The existence of associated production, e.g., K + \u039b, additionally favors K + over K \u2212 . Due to the steeply falling primary cosmic ray energy spectrum, which follows an E \u22122.7 power law, a single-muon event in a deep underground detector is more likely to arise from the decay of a leading hadron than from a secondary hadron or later generation hadrons. The rise at TeV energies is explained in Ref. [10] as an increased contribution from kaon decay in the region of muon energy and zenith angle \u03c0 < E \u00b5 cos \u03b8 z < K . The critical energies, , are meson energies for which the decay probability and interaction probability are equal at the altitude in the atmosphere where the majority of detected muons are produced. The values for these energies are \u03c0 = 115 GeV and K = 850 GeV [11].",

            "text": "In underground detectors, a multiple-muon event occurs when two or more almost-parallel muons are observed that originate from a common cosmic-ray primary. The process typically involves more than the decay of a single leading hadron. Events can be produced by two or more hadrons from the first interaction, or by particles produced in secondary interactions or deeper in the hadronic shower. Some events are also produced by the dimuon decay of a single leading hadron, but the branching fraction for this process is relatively small. In the MINOS Far Detector, which has a depth of 2070 meters-of-water-equivalent (mwe), multiple-muon events account for 7% of the observed cosmic-ray events. In a multiple-muon event, there can be some muons for which the charge is well measured and other muons for which the charge measurement is ambiguous. This paper reports the charge ratio in MINOS for tracks in multiplemuon events in which at least one muon's charge is wellmeasured, whether or not the charges of other muons in the same multiple-muon event are known. In multiplemuon events, all muons with a well-measured charge are included in the calculation of the charge ratio.  [9] for the multiple-muon charge ratio at a depth of 3800 mwe, smaller than the single-muon ratio cited above. In the next three paragraphs, three related factors are discussed that might make the measured multiple-muon charge ratio lower than the single-muon charge ratio: a) the importance of the leading u quark charge is diminished for non-leading hadrons and those produced after the first interaction, b) the possibility of an increased heavy-nucleus component of the cosmic ray flux at high energy, and c) the kinematics of multiple-muon events coupled with the Maximum Detectable Momentum (MDM) of a magnetic detector like MINOS.",

            "text": "A second effect comes from the fact that heavier elements make a relatively larger contribution to the cosmicray primaries responsible for multiple-muon events than for single-muon events, for two reasons. First, the mean primary cosmic-ray energy for observed multiple muons is higher than that for single muons, and it is expected that heavier elements become a more important component of cosmic-ray primaries at higher energies [13]. Second, massive primaries generate more high-energy muons per event than proton primaries of the same total energy. This is because the first interaction point of the heavy primary is likely to be higher in the atmosphere than for a proton primary. A heavy nucleus has a larger cross section for the interactions with air, and the lower density in the upper atmosphere favors pion decay over interaction early in the cascade development. Heavy nuclei also contain neutrons, which have twice as many d quarks as u quarks, and are therefore more likely to produce a leading negative pion, resulting in a decreased muon charge ratio.",

A magnetic detector can only reliably measure the charge of muons with a momentum below the MDM, which depends on the magnetic field and the detector geometry. Thus sometimes the highest-energy muon at the detector in a multiplemuon event will not have the sign of its curvature determined. In these situations, only lower-energy muons, from non-leading pions, will be used in the determination of the charge ratio. Since the leading pion is the most likely to carry the excess positive charge in the shower, this effect will reduce the measured charge ratio.

In MINOS, the MDM is approximately a function only of the angle with respect to the detector axis and the distance of closest approach to the magnet coil, called the impact parameter, which can vary from zero to four meters [17]. For favorable values of these two parameters the MDM reaches 470 GeV, but is as low as 15 GeV for other angles and impact parameters.

The first variable uses outputs of the Kalman filter technique used in the track curvature fitting. The quantity (q/p)/\u03c3(q/p), called the curvature significance, can be thought of as the significance with which a straight-line fit to the track can be rejected, using the pattern of curvature that is expected given the magnetic field. Figure 1 shows the measured multiple-muon charge ratio in the data as a function of the curvature significance. The figure shows separately the data taken in the two magnetic field orientations, illustrating systematic differences in the charge ratio measurements between FF and RF data. These differences come from acceptance effects due to the magnetic field, detector asymmetry, and detector alignment errors. To remove these biases, data taken in the two field orientations is combined by calculating a geometric mean (GM) between the two data sets, described at the beginning of Section V. Events with low values of the curvature significance are typically high-momentum tracks (> 100 GeV/c) that do not significantly curve while traversing the MINOS detector. For such tracks, the charge sign determined by the fitter becomes less reliable. As the curvature significance tends to zero, the fitter picks the two charge signs with nearly equal probability and, as can be seen from Fig. 1, the measured charge ratio tends to unity. A cut is applied such that only tracks with |(q/p)/\u03c3(q/p)| > 3 are used in the analysis.",

These two Monte Carlo (MC) data samples use different methods to simulate the muon charges and momenta, as well as the vertex positions where the muons enter the detector. In each case, this information is used as the input to the GEANT4based simulation [19] that propagates the muons through the MINOS FD, taking into account the magnetic field and the muon energy losses as they travel through the steel and scintillator. This GEANT4-based simulation furthermore models the production of light in the scintillator strips and the full chain of PMTs and readout electronics that converts this light into raw detector data. These simulated data are then passed through the same reconstruction and analysis as the real data. The reconstruction algorithms must form tracks out of scintillator signals. The scintillator strips in alternating planes are oriented at 90 \u2022 to each other; scintillator hits in each of these two views are used to reconstruct muon tracks. The tracks of multiple muons passing through the detector simultaneously may overlap in one or both of these views. This overlap can confuse the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in reconstruction failures. To assess the frequency of such reconstruction failures, it is necessary to produce a sample of simulated muons with distributions of vertex positions and directions that accurately match the data. To obtain the necessary MC sample, the vertex positions and direction cosines of a large sample of real cosmic muon data are used as the seeds of simulated multiple-muon events in the detector. Once a vertex position and direction has been chosen for the primary muon of the event, the vertex positions and directions of the subsequent muons are taken from real muons that have directions within 5 \u2022 of the primary muon. To obtain broadly representative energy and charge distributions for these simulated muons, the energy and charge of each muon is taken from a CORSIKA [20] simulation, which is described in more detail below.",

These charge reconstruction failures are dominated by events with large radiative energy loss, which has a significantly higher rate for muon energies above 1 TeV. An inaccurate muon energy distribution being modeled by CORSIKA would be a source of systematic error. This is examined by comparing some features of our MC with two other MC simulations: a different version of COR-SIKA, and an earlier program developed for the Soudan 2 experiment [24,25], which studied multiple-muon events at a location near the MINOS FD. No differences were noticed in the calculations of energy loss, multiplicity, and other features of multiple-muon events underground. As another check, the rate of reconstructed showers was compared in the data, in the MC simulation, and in charge-misidentified MC events. There was a negligible rate of charge-misidentified events with no showers. The mean number of showers in events with at least one shower in these three samples was 1.70, 2.14 and 2.68 respectively. There is thus some evidence that the Monte Carlo simulation is overestimating the number of high-energy muon events, and hence the correction to the charge ratio. The ratio 2.14/1.70 = 1.26 is taken as evidence that there are 26% more showers in the MC than there should be. This value is conservatively increased by half, and 39% systematic error is used as a possible overcorrection. Half of 39%, or 20%, is then taken as the systematic error on a possible undercorrection. Since the size of the correction is 0.013, this leads to a systematic error on R corr. from randomization of +0.003 \u22120.005 . When combined in quadrature with the systematic error from bias, the total systematic error is +0.009 \u22120.010 . Thus the efficiency-corrected multiple-muon charge ratio at a depth of 2070 mwe is determined to be R corr. = 1.104 \u00b1 0.006 (stat.) +0.009 \u22120.010 (syst.). This measurement agrees within uncertainties with the recent OPERA measurement of 1.098 \u00b1 0.023 (stat.) +0.015 \u22120.013 (syst.) (2014) [9] and has a much smaller uncertainty.",
