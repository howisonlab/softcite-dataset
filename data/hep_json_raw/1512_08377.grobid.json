The H \u2192 4 denotes the Higgs boson decay to the four-lepton final state via an intermediate pair of neutral electroweak bosons.

The measurement of the ratio of cross sections -1 -JHEP04(2016)005 at 7 and 8 TeV is also performed. The differential fiducial cross sections are measured using just the 8 TeV data, due to the limited statistics of the 7 TeV data set. The cross sections are corrected for effects related to detector efficiency and resolution. The fiducial phase space constitutes approximately 42% of the total available phase space, and there is no attempt to extrapolate the measurements to the full phase space. This approach is chosen to reduce the systematic uncertainty associated with the underlying model of the Higgs boson properties and production mechanism. The remaining dependence of each measurement on the model assumptions is determined and quoted as a separate systematic effect. Due to the strong dependence of the cross section times branching fraction on the mass of the Higgs boson (m H ) in the region around 125 GeV, the measurements are performed assuming a mass of m H = 125.0 GeV, as measured by the CMS experiment using the H \u2192 4 and H \u2192 2\u03b3 channels [11]. This approach also allows an easier comparison of measurements with the theoretical estimations.",

In addition, measurements of the Z \u2192 4 fiducial cross section, and of its ratio to the corresponding H \u2192 4 fiducial cross section are also performed using the 8 TeV data.

The HRes generator is a partonic level Monte Carlo (MC) generator that provides a description of the gg \u2192 H process at NNLO accuracy in perturbative QCD and next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy in the resummation of soft-gluon effects at small transverse momenta [33,34]. Since the resummation is inclusive over the QCD radiation recoiling against the Higgs boson, HRes is considered for the estimation of fiducial cross sections that are inclusive in the associated jet activity. The HRes estimations are obtained by choosing the central values for the renormalization and factorization scales to be m H = 125.0 GeV. The Powheg generator is a partonic level matrix-element generator that implements NLO perturbative QCD calculations and additionally provides an interface with parton shower programs. It provides a description of the gg \u2192 H production in association with zero jets at NLO accuracy. For the purpose of this analysis, it has been tuned using the powheg damping factor hdump of 104.16 GeV, to closely match JHEP04(2016)005 the Higgs boson p T spectrum in the full phase space, as estimated by the HRes generator. This factor minimises emission of the additional jets in the limit of large p T , and enhances the contribution from the Sudakov form factor as p T approaches zero [35,36]. The Powheg MiNLO HJ generator is an extension of the Powheg V2 generator based on the MiNLO prescription [37] for the improved next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy applied to the gg \u2192 H production in association with up to one additional jet. It provides a description of the gg \u2192 H production in association with zero jets and one jet at NLO accuracy, and the gg \u2192 H production in association with two jets only at the leading-order (LO) accuracy. All the generators used to describe the gg \u2192 H process take into account the finite masses of the bottom and top quarks. The description of the SM Higgs boson production in the vector boson fusion (VBF) process is obtained at NLO accuracy using the powheg generator. The processes of SM Higgs boson production associated with gauge bosons (VH) or top quark-antiquark pair (ttH) are described at LO accuracy using Pythia 6.4 [38]. The MC samples simulated with these generators are normalized to the inclusive SM Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions that correspond to the SM calculations at NNLO and NNLL accuracy, in accordance with the LHC Higgs Cross section Working Group recommendations [39].The powheg samples of the gg \u2192 H and VBF processes are used together with the pythia samples of the VH and ttH processes to model the SM signal acceptance in the fiducial phase space and to extract the results of the fiducial cross section measurements following the method described in section 6. These samples, together with the HRes and Powheg MiNLO HJ samples of the alternative description of the gg \u2192 H process, are used to compare the measurement results to the SM-based theoretical calculations in section 8.",

The HRes generator does not provide an interface with programs that can simulate the effects of hadronization and multi-parton interactions. In order to account for these effects in the HRes estimations, the HRes generator is used to first reweight the Powheg+JHUGen events simulated without multiparton interaction and hadronization effects in a phase space that is slightly larger than the fiducial phase space. After that, the multi-parton interaction and hadronization effects are simulated using pythia and the reweighted Powheg+JHUGen events. The reweighting is performed separately for each observable of interest for the differential, as well as for the integrated cross section measurements. This procedure effectively adds the non-perturbative effects to the HRes partonic level estimations.",

Events are selected online requiring the presence of a pair of electrons or muons, or a triplet of electrons. Triggers requiring an electron and a muon are also used. The minimum p T of the leading and subleading lepton are 17 and 8 GeV, respectively, for the double-lepton triggers, while they are 15, 8 and 5 GeV for the triple-electron trigger. Events with at least four well identified and isolated electrons or muons are then selected offline, if they are compatible with being produced at the primary vertex. The primary vertex is selected to be the one with the highest sum of p 2 T of associated tracks. Among all same-flavour and opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs in the event, the one with an invariant mass closest to the nominal Z boson mass is denoted Z 1 and retained if its mass, m(Z 1 ), satisfies 40 \u2264 m(Z 1 ) \u2264 120 GeV. The remaining leptons are considered and the presence of a second + \u2212 pair, denoted -5 -JHEP04(2016)005 Z 2 , is required with condition 12 \u2264 m(Z 2 ) \u2264 120 GeV. If more than one Z 2 candidate satisfies all criteria, the pair of leptons with the largest sum of the transverse momenta magnitudes, \u03a3|p T |, is chosen. Among the four selected leptons i (i = 1 . . . 4) forming the Z 1 and Z 2 candidates, at least one lepton should have p T \u2265 20 GeV, another one p T \u2265 10 GeV, and any opposite-charge pair of leptons + i and \u2212 j , irrespective of flavor, must satisfy m( + i \u2212 j ) \u2265 4 GeV.

The p T sum excludes any neutrinos, as well as any photon or stable lepton that is a daughter of the lepton for which the isolation sum is being computed. The ratio of this sum and the p T of the considered lepton must be less than 0.4, in line with the requirement on the lepton isolation at the reconstruction level [17]. The inclusion of isolation is an important step in the fiducial phase space definition as it reduces significantly the differences in signal selection efficiency between different signal models. It has been verified in simulation that the signal selection efficiency differs by up to 45% between different models if the lepton isolation requirement is not included. This is especially pronounced in case of large associated jet activity as in the case of ttH production mode.

In order to achieve this goal, we estimate those effects using simulation and include them in the parameterization of the expected m 4 spectra at the reconstruction level. We then perform a maximum likelihood fit of the signal and background parameterizations to the observed 4 mass distribution, N obs (m 4 ), and directly extract the fiducial cross sections of interest (\u03c3 fid ) from the fit. In this approach all systematic uncertainties are included in the form of nuisance parameters, which are effectively integrated out in the fit procedure. The results of measurements are obtained using an asymptotic approach [53] with the test statistics based on the profile likelihood ratio [54]. The coverage of the quoted intervals obtained with this approach has been verified for a subset of results using the Feldman-Cousins method [55]. The maximum likelihood fit is performed simultaneously in all final states and in all bins of the observable considered in the measurement, assuming a Higgs boson mass of m H = 125.0 GeV. The integrated cross section measurement is treated as a special case with a single bin. This implementation of the procedure for the unfolding of the detector effects from the observed distributions is different from the implementations commonly used in the experimental measurements, such as those discussed in ref.

It has been verified in simulation that the shape of these events is identical to the shape of the resonant fiducial signal and, in order to minimise the model dependence of the measurement, its normalization is fixed to be a fraction of the fiducial signal component. The value of this fraction, which we denote by f nonfid , has been determined from simulation for each of the studied signal models, and it varies from \u223c5% for the gg \u2192 H production to \u223c14% for the ttH production mode.

These exotic models are briefly introduced in section 3 and detailed in ref. [18]. The largest deviation between the fiducial cross sections measured assuming these alternative signal models and the fiducial cross section measured under the SM Higgs boson assumption is quoted as the systematic effect associated with the model dependence.

In the computation of the total uncertainty the PDFs/\u03b1 S uncertainties are assumed to be correlated between the VBF and VH production modes (dominantly quark-antiquark initiated), and anticorrelated between the gg \u2192 H and ttH production modes (dominantly gluon-gluon initiated).

The differential cross sections were measured as a function of the transverse momentum and JHEP04(2016)005 the rapidity of the four-lepton system, the transverse momentum of the leading jet, the difference in rapidity between the Higgs boson candidate and the leading jet, and the jet multiplicity. Measurements of the fiducial cross section for the production of four leptons via the Z \u2192 4 decays, as well as its ratio to the H \u2192 4 cross section, were also performed using the 8 TeV data. The uncertainty in the measurements due to the assumptions in the model of Higgs boson properties was estimated by studying a range of exotic Higgs boson production and spin-parity models. It was found to be lower than 7% of the fiducial cross section.
