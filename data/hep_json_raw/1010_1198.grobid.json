The final state particles e, \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 were detected in CLAS and the exclusive process was identified by selecting a neutron with the missing mass technique. Figure 1 shows the acceptance-corrected invariant mass M \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 distributions for each (Q 2 , x B ) bin. One sees clearly the \u03c1 + peaks around 775 MeV. They are, however, sitting on top of a non-negligeable nonresonant, two-pion background. We have used two contributions to fit these spectra: a skewed Breit-Wigner distribution to describe the resonant structure of the \u03c1 + and a parametrization of the non-resonant two-pion continuum determined from simulations (mostly ep \u2192 en\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 phase space). In order to extract the total cross section of the reaction \u03b3 * p \u2192 n\u03c1 + , we have calculated for each (Q 2 , x B ) bin the area of the Breit-Wigner (green curve in Fig. 1), the distributions being already normalized and corrected for the acceptance. A separation of the longitudinal cross sections from the transverse ones was performed by analysing the pion decay angles of the \u03c1 + and relying on the SCHC (s-channel helicity conservation), which was checked experimentally.
