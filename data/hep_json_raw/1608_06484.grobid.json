The results are in good agreement with previous measurements within uncertainties; they can be used to determine the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle and improve upon the D + s semileptonic branching ratio precision.

            "text": "The semileptonic decays D + s \u2192 \u03b7e + \u03bd e and D + s \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e are important channels for the study of heavy quark decays and light meson spectroscopy. The inclusive semileptonic decay widths of the mesons D 0 , D + and D + s should be equal, up to SU (3) symmetry breaking and non-factorizable components [1]. The measured inclusive semileptonic decay widths of D 0 and D + mesons are proven to be consistent with each other. However, they are larger than that of D + s mesons by 20% [2], more than 3\u03c3 of the experimental uncertainties. The updated Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise form factor model (ISGW2) [3] predicts a difference between the D and D + s inclusive semileptonic rates, as the spectator quark masses m u and m s differ on the scale of the daughter quark mass m s in the Cabibbo favored semileptonic transition. Up to now, the exclusive semileptonic decays of D 0 and D + mesons have been well studied experimentally [4]. Therefore, measurements of the D + s exclusive semileptonic decay rates will provide helpful information to understand this difference. In addition, it is well known that the states \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are considered as candidates for mixing with gluonic components. The exclusive semileptonic decays D + s \u2192 \u03b7e + \u03bd e and D + s \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e probe the ss components of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 and thus are sensitive to the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle [5]. Therefore, measurements of these decay rates can constrain the physics related to the mixing with the gluonic components [6].",

Table V shows a comparison of the branching fractions for D + s \u2192 \u03b7e + \u03bd e and D + s \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e as measured by the BESIII Collaboration (this work), previous measurements [7][8][9] and the average values from PDG [4]. The branching fractions measured in this work are in good agreement with the previous measurements within uncertainties. The ISGW2 model involves an \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle close to \u221210 \u2022 , which is the minimum value obtained from mass formulas [4] if a quadratic approximation is used. According to Refs. [5,6], the measured ratio is consistent with a pseudoscalar mixing angle of about \u221218 \u2022 . Finally, the results improve upon the D + s semileptonic branching ratio precision and provide more information for comprehensively understanding the D + s weak decays. ",
