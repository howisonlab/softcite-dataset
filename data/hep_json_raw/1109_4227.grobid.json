This process violates both baryon and (baryon\u2212lepton) numbers by two units and is predicted by a large class of hypothetical models where the seesaw mechanism is incorporated to explain the observed tiny neutrino masses and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. No evidence for n \u2212n oscillation was found, the lower limit of the lifetime for neutrons bound in 16 O, in an analysis that included all of the significant sources of experimental uncertainties, was determined to be 1.9 \u00d7 10 32 years at the 90% confidence level. The corresponding lower limit for the oscillation time of free neutrons was calculated to be 2.7 \u00d7 10 8 s using a theoretical value of the nuclear suppression factor of 0.517 \u00d7 10 23 s \u22121 and its uncertainty.",

Sakharov in 1967 that B, C, CP violation, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics are needed to explain the observed matter-antimatter or baryon number asymmetry of the universe [1]. However recent experimental limits on p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 [2][3][4] and p \u2192\u03bdK + [5] have already ruled out the simplest B \u2212 L conserving GUTs, minimal SU (5) and the minimal supersymmetric version of SU (5), where L stands for lepton number. It has also been shown that any B \u2212 L conserving baryon asymmetry generated in the early universe (above 10 TeV scale) should be washed out until now by the triangle anomalies involving electro-weak bosons. Therefore the search for B \u2212 L violating reactions has become increasingly important as a potential explanation of the observed baryon number asymmetry in the universe.",

Kuzmin in 1970 [6].

The total momentum of the secondaries is nearly zero, except for the Fermi momenta of the annihilatingn and nucleon, and the total energy is nearly equal to the total mass of the two nucleons.

Since the literature on (n + nucleon) annihilation in nuclei is sparse,pp andpd data from hydrogen and deuterium bubble chambers [20][21][22] were used to determine the branching ratios for the annihilation final states. The branching ratios included in our simulations are displayed in Table I. The values of kinematic quantities in our MC were determined using relativistic phase-space distributions that included the Fermi momentum of the annihilating nucleons. Pions and omegas produced in then-nucleon annihilations were propagated through the residual nucleus. This study used a program originally developed for the IMB experiment to simulate meson-nucleon interactions [13]. The cross sections for the pion-residual nucleus interactions were based on an interpolation from measured pion-carbon and pionaluminum cross sections to those for pion- 16 O interactions. Excitation of the \u2206(1232) resonance was the most important effect in the nuclear propagation phase. It was assumed that the pion and omega cross sections scaled linearly with matter density, a quantity that decreases as the mesons move away from the annihilation point and exit from the nucleus. The Fermi momentum of the interacting nucleon and the possibility of Pauli blocking were also included in our simulations. We found that 49% of the pions did not interact, while 24% were absorbed and 3% interacted with a nucleon to produce an additional pion or occasionally two more pions, and the rest of the pion interactions involved scattering. These interaction probabilities yielded total and charged pion multiplicities of 3.5 and 2.2, respectively, with an average charged pion momentum of 310 MeV/c and an RMS width of 190 MeV/c. There was a probability of 0.56% that an event included an \u03c9 0 that emerged from the nucleus without having decayed. The final states of the nuclear fragments were calculated using an algorithm based on a simulation from ORNL [23]. Fragments of the residual nucleus that contained two or more nucleons were not simulated in water, since most of the nucleons in these fragments had momenta that were below the threshold for inelastic hadron interactions. Therefore only free n and p fragments were propagated through water.",

Most of the cosmic ray muon events are rejected by a requirement that the number of hit PMTs in the outer detector within 800 ns of the trigger be less than 25. We also require that the reconstructed visible energy be greater than 30 MeV to remove the remaining low energy radioactivity.

The 0.6% asymmetry in the detector gain and the 2.0% difference in the energy scale between the data and the MC would affect the momentum cut and contribute 1.7% and 0.4% uncertainties, respectively. By comparing real data with MC events we estimate that the uncertainty in the Cherenkov ring finding procedure is 2.2%.

A small number of simple selection criteria were employed and the search window in total momentum versus invariant mass was optimized for this exposure. Twenty four events pass the selection criteria, but the estimated background was 24.1 \u00b1 5.7 events, and the distribution of events agrees with the expectation from atmospheric neutrino interactions. The signal efficiency was 12.1 \u00b1 2.8%. We performed a limit calculation that incorporates systematic uncertainties, arriving at a bound lifetime limit of T n\u2212n > 1.9 \u00d7 10 32 years. This is more than four times greater than the best limit from a water Cherenkov experiment, despite having nearly eighty times the exposure because these searches are background limited. Using a recent calculation of the nuclear suppression factor, the negative results of our search for n \u2212n oscillation in 16 O is equivalent to a lifetime limit for free n \u2212n oscillation of greater than 2.7 \u00d7 10 8 seconds. This result is three times more restrictive than the ILL/Grenoble reactor experiment. This places strict limitations on (\u2206B = 2, \u2206L = 0) processes in physics beyond the Standard Model.",
