            "text": "In the Standard Model, the flavour-changing neutral current decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 proceeds via ab \u2192sss penguin amplitude. The decay was first observed by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron [1]. Subsequently, it has been studied by the CDF and LHCb collaborations, who searched for CP -violating asymmetries in the decay time and angular distributions of this mode [2][3][4][5]. These studies provide a probe for possible new physics contributions entering into the penguin loop and B 0 s \u2212B 0 s mixing diagrams [6]. Furthermore, as the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 mode will be used as normalization for studies of other charmless B 0 s meson decays, it is important to have a precise determination of its branching fraction. The CDF collaboration measured this relative to the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 [2]. Using the current value of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 branching fraction [7], the CDF result gives B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (1.91\u00b10.26\u00b10.16)\u00d710 \u22125 , where the first uncertainty is from the measured ratio to B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6, and the second is due to the knowledge of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 branching fraction. Various predictions from theories based on QCD factorization exist for the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 branching fraction [8][9][10]. These suffer from uncertainties related to weak annihilation diagrams. These uncertainties are controlled using experimental information from decays such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * (892) 0 . Several recent predictions are summarized in table 1. The central values are in the range (1.5\u22122.0)\u00d710 \u22125 .",

The largest variation in the ratio of branching fractions seen in these studies is 0.6 %, which is assigned as a relative systematic uncertainty. The track reconstruction efficiency agrees between data and simulation at the level of 2.0 % [43]. This uncertainty largely cancels in the ratio of branching fractions. A residual relative uncertainty of 0.5 % remains due to the fact that the pion in the B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K * (892) 0 decay mode is relatively soft. An additional relative uncertainty of 0.3 % is assigned to account for the difference in the hadronic interaction probabilities for kaons and pions between data and simulation. A further uncertainty arises from the modelling of the hardware trigger in the simulation. This is estimated using a data-driven technique and leads to a relative systematic uncertainty of 1.1 % on the ratio of branching fractions. Variations in the procedure used to determine the relative particle identification efficiency lead to a relative uncertainty of 0.3 %. Possible systematic effects on the efficiency for B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 due to the finite width difference in the B 0 s system [44] have been checked, and found to be negligible. The value of B(\u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) is taken from ref. [7] and contributes a relative uncertainty of 1.0 %. The value of B(K * (892) 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is taken to be 2/3 exactly. The systematic uncertainties are summarized in table 2. Summing these in quadrature gives a relative uncertainty of 3.8 % on the ratio of branching fractions. The knowledge of the fragmentation fraction ratio, f s /f d , gives a relative uncertainty of 5.8 %, which is quoted separately.",
