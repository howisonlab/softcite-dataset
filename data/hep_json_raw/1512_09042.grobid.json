The effects associated with nuclear targets are highly convolved: uncertainties from the binding energy, Fermi motion, multinucleon correlations and final-state interactions (FSIs) are present in different interaction channels for all nuclear targets. These nuclear effects lead to an imprecise knowledge of the neutrino energy spectrum, the latter in turn preventing a direct measurement of the former. A possible disentanglement between the two via identifying nuclear effects with transverse kinematics imbalance has been recently proposed [3,4].

Across all bins, the cross section-normalized yield is the spectrum independent of nuclear effects. Major uncertainties come from the accuracy of the background subtraction and the detector resolution of E \u03bd rec from the hydrogen events.

Transverse kinematics are then calculated with respect to the simulated neutrino direction. In practice, the neutrino direction can be reconstructed event by event as the direction from the mean decay point of the neutrino parents to the event vertex. This technique is most useful for off-axis neutrinos to a near detector. Uncertainties in both neutrino direction reconstruction and tracking contribute to the resolution of the reconstructed transverse kinematics-in this study 20 MeV/c for \u03b4p TT is assumed. The assumed Cauchy shape is motivated by the characteristic tails in the momentum smearing caused by the multiple scattering of a charged particle in detector material.

The signal to background ratio (S/B) in the 2\u03c3 window is 0. 10 \u00d7 Due to FSIs, nuclear events can have nuclear emissions (products of nucleus excitation and breakup) in the final state. Therefore Np1\u03c0 + events with more than 1 proton and/or any hits are rejected to suppress the nuclear background. Background from other channels, like deep inelastic scattering (DIS), is also partially removed by this cut. As the overall background is reduced, the corresponding S/B is increased to 0.9.

With the proposed technique, nuclei in a multinuclear target are useful because they provide a safe and convenient base for hydrogen doping; uncertainties due to the nuclear effects can be eliminated by improving the tracking resolution-in fact, strong nuclear effects are preferred for an efficient removal of the background via, for example, vetoing nuclear emissions.",
