Inclusive \u03b3 + 2 b-jet production may also originate from partonic subprocesses involving parton fragmentation into a photon. However, using photon isolation requirements significantly reduces the contributions from such processes. Next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations of the \u03b3 + 2 b-jet production cross section, which includes all b-quark mass effects, have recently become available [4]. These calculations are based on the four-flavor number scheme, which assumes four massless quark flavors and treats the b quark as a massive quark not appearing in the initial state.",

The subdetectors most relevant to this analysis are the central tracking system, composed of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) and a central fiber tracker embedded in a 1.9 T solenoidal magnetic field, the central preshower detector (CPS), and the calorimeter. The CPS is located immediately before the inner layer of the central calorimeter and is formed of approximately one radiation length of lead absorber followed by three layers of scintillating strips. The calorimeter consists of a central section (CC) with coverage in pseudorapidity of |\u03b7 det | < 1.1, 14 and two end calorimeters (EC) extending coverage to |\u03b7 det | \u2248 4.2, each housed in a separate cryostat, with scintillators between the CC and EC cryostats providing sampling of developing show- The data used in this analysis are required to satisfy D0 experiment data quality criteria that ensure the proper functioning of detector subsystems (calorimeter and tracking detectors are most important for this analysis) [14] during data-taking.

The trigger efficiency is \u2248 96% for photon candidates with p \u03b3 T = 30 GeV and 100% for p \u03b3 T 40 GeV. Offline event selection requires a reconstructed pp interaction vertex [16] within 60 cm of the center of the detector along the beam axis. The efficiency of the vertex requirement is \u2248 (96-98)%, depending on p \u03b3 T . The missing transverse momentum in the event is required to be less than 0.7p \u03b3 T to suppress background from W \u2192 e\u03bd decays.

The uncertainties on the data include both statistical (inner error bar) and total uncertainties (full error bar). Similar ratios to NLO calculations for predictions with sherpa [17], pythia [18] and k T -factorization [29,30] are also presented along with the scale uncertainties on NLO and k T -factorization predictions. T , and an uncertainty of 2% is assigned to account for differences between the two MC generators. NLO predictions based on MSTW2008 [27] are close to those made with NNPDF2.3 [28] and are slightly higher (up to 7% at small p \u03b3 T ) than the predictions using CT10. The predictions based on the k T -factorization approach [29,30] and unintegrated parton distributions [31] are also given in Table 1. The k T -factorization formalism contains additional contributions to the cross sections due to resummation of gluon radiation diagrams with k 2 T above a scale \u03bc 2 of O(1 GeV), where k T denotes the transverse momentum of the radiated gluon. Apart from this resummation, the non-vanishing transverse momentum distribution of the colliding partons are taken into account. These effects lead to a broadening of the photon transverse momentum distribution in this approach [29]. The scale uncertainties on these predictions vary from about 31% at 30 < p \u03b3 T < 40 GeV to about 50% in the highest p \u03b3 T bin. Table 1 also contains predictions from the pythia [18] MC event generator with the cteq6.1L PDF set. It includes only 2 \u2192 2 matrix elements (ME) with gb \u2192 \u03b3 b and qq \u2192 \u03b3 g scatterings (defined at LO) and with g \u2192 bb splitting in the parton shower (PS). We also provide predictions of the sherpa MC event generator [17] with the cteq6.6M PDF set [32]. For \u03b3 + b production, sherpa includes all the MEs with one photon and up to three jets, with at least one b-jet in our kinematic region. In particular, it accounts for an additional hard jet that accompanies the photon associated with 2 b jets. Compared to an NLO calculation, there is an additional benefit of imposing resummation (further emissions) through the consistent combination with the PS. Matching between the ME partons and the PS jets follows the prescription given in Ref. [33]. Systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the ME-PS matching sherpa [17], pythia [18] and k T -factorization [29,30] are also shown.",

All the theoretical predictions are obtained including the isolation requirement on the photon E iso T < 2.5 GeV. The predictions are compared to data in Fig. 4 as a function of p \u03b3 T . The ratios of data to the NLO QCD calculations with CT10 and of different QCD predictions or MC simulation to the same NLO QCD calculations are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of p \u03b3 T . The measured cross sections are well described by the NLO QCD calculations and the predictions from the k T -factorization approach in the full studied p \u03b3 T region considering the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Both of these predictions show consistent behavior, although the predictions from the k T -factorization approach suffer from larger uncertainties. pythia predicts significantly lower production rates and a more steeply falling p \u03b3 T distribution than observed in data. sherpa performs better in describing the normalization at high p \u03b3 T , but underestimates production rates compared to that observed in data at low p \u03b3 T .",

The remaining jet flavor contributions in the sample (e.g., light + light-jets, light +b(c)-jets, etc.) are small and are subtracted from the data. The fractions of these rarer jet contributions are estimated from sherpa simulation (which has been found to provide a good description of the data), and vary in the range (5-10)%. The difference in the values of these fractions obtained from sherpa and pythia, (2-4)%, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty on the background estimate. The fraction of 2 b-jet events are determined by performing a two-dimensional (corresponding to the 2 b-jet candidates) maximum likelihood fit of D MJL distributions of 2 jet events in data using the corresponding templates for 2 b-jets and 2 c-jets. These jet flavor templates are obtained from MC simulations. As an example, the result of one of these maximum likelihood fits to D MJL templates is presented in Fig. 2 (with \u03c7 2 /ndf = 6.80/5 for data/MC agreement).

The sum of transverse energy in the cone includes all stable particles[23]. The acceptance is driven by selection requirements in |\u03b7 det | (applied to avoid edge effects in the calorimeter regions used for the measurement) and |\u03c6 det | (to avoid periodic calorimeter module boundaries), photon |\u03b7 \u03b3 | and p \u03b3 T , and bin-to-bin migration effects due to the finite energy resolution of the EM calorimeter. The combined photon and jets acceptance with respect to the p T and rapidity selections varies between 66% and 77% in different p \u03b3 T bins. Uncertainties on the acceptance due to the jet energy scale[24], jet energy resolu-tion, and the difference between results obtained with sherpa and pythia are in the range of (8-12)%.The data, corrected for photon and jet acceptance, reconstruction efficiencies and the admixture of background events, are presented at the particle level by unfolding for effects of detector resolution, photon and b-jet detection inefficiencies. The differential cross sections of \u03b3 + 2 b-jet production are extracted in five bins of p \u03b3 T . They are given inTable 1. The data points are plotted at the values of p \u03b3 T for which the value of a smooth function describing the dependence of the cross section on p \u03b3 T equals the averaged cross section in the bin[25].The cross sections fall by more than two orders of magnitude in the range 30 < p\u03b3 T < 200 GeV. The statistical uncertainty on the results ranges from 4.3% in the first p \u03b3 T bin to 9% in the last p \u03b3 T bin, while the total systematic uncertainty ranges up to 20%. Main sources of systematic uncertainty are the photon purity (up to 8%), photon and two b-jet acceptance (up to 14%), b-jet fraction (up to 13%), and integrated luminosity (6%) [10]. At higher p \u03b3 T , the uncertainty is dominated by the fractions of b-jet events and their selection efficiencies. NLO perturbative QCD predictions, with the renormalization scale \u03bc R , factorization scale \u03bc F , and fragmentation scale \u03bc f all set to p \u03b3 T , are also given in Table 1. The uncertainty from the scale choice is (15-20)% and is estimated through a simultaneous variation of all three scales by a factor of two, i.e., for \u03bc R,F , f = 0.5p \u03b3 T and 2p \u03b3 T . The predictions utilize CT10nlo_nf4 PDFs [26] and are corrected for non-perturbative effects of parton-to-hadron fragmentation and multiple parton interactions. The latter are evaluated using sherpa and pythia MC samples with their standard settings [17,18]. The overall correction varies from about 0.90 at 30 < p \u03b3 T < 40 GeV to about 0.95 at high p \u03b3",
