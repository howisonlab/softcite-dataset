In proton-proton collisions at LHC, the measurement of their production cross-section will allow to test perturbative QCD calculations in a new energy regime and provide the baseline for measurements in heavy ion collisions. In the latter, as they experience the full evolution of the collision, heavy quarks are ideal probes to study the property of the system. During the 2010 campaign of the LHC, ALICE took proton-proton data at \u221a s=7 TeV and Pb-Pb data at \u221a s nn =2.76 TeV. The first physics results on heavy flavors production in p-p collisions are presented combining hadronic and (semi-)leptonic channels, both at central and forward rapidity.",

            "text": "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [1] is the experiment dedicated to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities (> 10 GeV/fm 3 ), as those which are expected to be reached in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Lattice QCD calculations predict that under this condition a deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma could be formed. In the new energy domain reached by the LHC, heavy quarks are abundantly produced. The study of their production, propagation and hadronization in the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy ion collisions can provide valuable information about the properties of the system. In fact, heavy quarks are produced in the first stage of the collisions and then they coexist with the surrounding medium due to their long lifetime. For example, the energy density of the created medium can be inferred by an energy loss measurement of heavy quark. The study of the production of heavy quarkonia, J/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 (cc states), \u03a5, \u03a5 \u2032 and \u03a5 \u2032\u2032 , (bb states) is particularly interesting, because it can lead to a measurement of the temperature of the system. It was originally proposed that quarkonium resonances will dissociate by color screening in the QGP [2], thus a suppression of quarkonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions compared to proton-proton collisions was predicted as a signature of the QGP formation. However, it is now recognized that in order to interpret J/\u03c8 production as a QGP probe one has to consider cold nuclear matter effects such as initial state energy loss and shadowing, as well as charm quark energy loss, co-mover interactions, corrections for feed-down from higher mass charmonium states, and secondary production mechanisms, such as recombination of initially uncorrelated cc pairs [3]. In this contribution we present results based on the data collected by the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s=7 TeV.",

The remaining hadron contamination varies from the permille level at 0.5 GeV/c to about 15% at 4 GeV/c and is subtracted by a multiple Gaussian fit performed in momentum slices of the TPC dE/dx distribution. The signal extraction method consists in subtracting from the inclusive electron spectrum a cocktail of the background electron sources, namely, electrons from light hadron decays, photon conversions in the material of the beam pipe and of the SPD.

Superimposed are the different cocktail contributions to this p T distribution. The excess of electrons above the cocktail level can be attributed to the signal of electrons from heavy-flavour decays (including J/\u03c8, not yet included in the cocktail). An excess is clearly seen, increasing as a function of p T , as expected.

Apart from the heavy flavour, three main background sources are contributing to the single-muon p T distribution. (i) Muons from the decay-in-flight of light hadrons produced at the interaction point called \"decay muons\". (ii) Muons from the decay of hadrons produced in the interaction with the front absorber, called \"secondary muons\". The last source of background are (iii) the punch-through hadrons. This last contribution can be rejected by requiring that the reconstructed track reaches the trigger stations placed behind the iron wall, leaving hits in at least three chambers out of four. In the present analysis, muons are required to have p T greater than 2 GeV/c thus removing most of the background which has a softer p T distributions. With such a cut, the contribution from secondary muons is reduced to about 3%. About 25% of the remaining background originates from decaying muons and is subtracted by means of simulations. The transverse momentum distribution of decay muons was generated with the Perugia-0 tune of PYTHIA [9], and normalized in such a way that the resulting fraction of decay-muons in the p T range where this contribution is dominant (0.5< p T < 1 GeV/c) is the same as the one provided by the simulation. After background subtraction, the muon p T spectrum is corrected for efficiency. The resulting differential cross section for charm and beauty production in the single muon decay channel is shown in figure 3 for an integrated luminosity of 3.49 nb \u22121 .

The tracking is performed using the TPC and the ITS, requiring a minimum number of clusters inside the TPC of 90, in order to ensure a good quality track. The signal extraction is done subtracting the like sign distribution to the opposite sign invariant mass spectra. Preliminary results are based on an integrated luminosity of 1.5 nb \u22121 . The number of J/\u03c8 is extracted, with a bin counting technique, in the mass range 2.9-3.15 GeV/c 2 and it amounts to 95 \u00b1 18(stat.).

The J/\u03c8 signal is extracted by fitting the invariant mass distribution with two Crystal Ball functions (for the J/\u03c8 and the \u03c8') and two exponentials (below and above the J/\u03c8 mass). A more detailed description of the analysis procedure can be found in reference [10]. The total number of J/\u03c8 is N J/\u03c8 =1924 \u00b177(stat.).

Figure 4-left shows the resulting d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dp T in the rapidity range -4< y <-2.5. These results are compared with the corresponding measurement done by the LHCb experiment [11]. The agreement with the preliminary results of the LHCb experiment, in the same rapidity range, is clearly visible. A comparison with a Color Evaporation Model (CEM) calculation for prompt J/\u03c8 [12] is also shown. The predictions underestimate the experimental results but a more meaningful comparison would require the subtraction of J/\u03c8 coming from beauty decay.",

ALICE has good capability to measure heavy-flavour in various decay channels at both central and forward rapidity down to zero p T . In particular, we have shown the first results concerning open heavy-flavour measurements in single electron and single muon channels as a function of p T . For both analysis, the next step will be to extend the p T range. First comparison with pQCD calculations shows good agreement. We have measured charm production at central rapidity using fully-reconstructed decays of D mesons in hadronic final states. The D 0 and D + p T distributions have been extracted. Analysis for other decay channels are well advanced. We have presented the first results on rapidity-and p T -differential cross sections of inclusive J/\u03c8 production at central and forward rapidity, using its leptonic decay channels.",
