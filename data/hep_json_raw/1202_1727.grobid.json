The use of a moderate magnetic field (B=0.5 T) in the barrel region coupled with little material close to the interaction point (7% X 0 perpendicular to the beam direction) allows the study of particle spectra down to very low p T (\u223c100 MeV/c). In the barrel region ALICE has extensive particle identification capabilities, for charged hadrons via measurements of dE/dx in the inner silicon detector (ITS) and Time Projection Chamber (TPC), in the time-of-flight detector (TOF), and by a devoted transition radiation detector for electrons.",

The trigger requires a hit in the inner silicon detector (SPD) or in either two scintillator counters arrays (VZERO) positioned at z=3.3 m and 0.9 m from the interaction point, close to the beam pipe. The minimum bias trigger essentially requires at least one charged particle anywhere in 8 units of rapidity. Data collected at \u221a s=2.76 TeV in 2011 have been also analyzed, with a total of 65 million events. Section 2 present measurements related to inelastic cross section and diffraction, while section 3 reports several measurements studying production mechanisms, taking advantage of particle identification capabilities of the detector. Section 4 presents general events characterstics, obtained by means of Bose-Einstein correlations and studies of fluctuations in p T . Other proton proton soft QCD topics actively studied in ALICE and not reported here include the study of \u03c0 0 yield to constrain the gluon fragmentation function and characterization of underlying event observables. Results related to heavy flavours in proton proton collisions are presented elsewhere in this conference [2].",

            "text": "For the analysis of the inelastic cross section ALICE used three subdetectors: the VZERO, the silicon pixel detector (SPD), and the forward multiplicity detector (FMD), an array of silicon sensors at large rapidity. With the addition of the FMD the pseudorapidity coverage is -3.7< \u03b7 <5.1. Due to the geometry of the detectors used it was possible to define one and two-arm triggers and to study the pseudorapidity gap pattern of the tracks obtained from the event vertex and a hit in SPD, VZERO or FMD. With this technique ALICE measured the relative fraction of single diffractive (SD) and double diffractive (DD) processes. Since the non-diffracted proton in SD processes is outside detector acceptance in ALICE, the measurement is model dependent. PYTHIA and PHOJET Monte Carlo generators were tuned using the model described in [4] to provide the SD cross-section dependence on the diffracted mass. The result for SD and DD cross section are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, compared with previous measurements at lower center of mass energies. There is good agreement between ALICE and UA5 at \u221a s=900 GeV. Within the errors, the theoretical models broadly describe the data, though they all have a difficulty to fit the data simultaneously at lower and higher energies, especially for DD processes. The ratio of \u03c3 S D and \u03c3 DD with respect to the inelastic cross sections is constant within the uncertainty. Further details can be found in [8].",

The extraction of Hanbury-Brown Twiss radii, and their dependence on various observables, may shed light on the spatial scale of the emitting source. This femtoscopic analysis in pp collisions is able to obtain precise data on 'elementary' systems. High-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC have particles densities comparable to that measured at RHIC in heavy ions, and a direct comparison of the freeze-out sizes of systems with very different initial states is therefore possible. The correlation function for identical pion pairs is defined as C (q) = A (q) /B (q), where A (q) is the measured two-pion distribution of pair momentum difference q = p 2 \u2212 p 1 , and B (q) is the equivalent distribution obtained by using pairs of particles coming from different events. A quantitative analysis of the correlation functions allows the extraction of the sizes of the emitting source (HBT radii) R G long , R G out and R G side , which are oriented along the beam axis, along the pair transverse momentum k T and perpendicular to the other two. Full details are described in [11]. Fig. 8 shows dependence of the HBT radii on the pair transverse momentum, for various event multiplicities. We observe R G out and R G side decrease with k T at large multiplicities, while R G long falls at all multiplicities. In heavy ions collisions the decrease with k T is a signature of collective motion. While the observed behaviour in pp is qualitatively similar, the difference seen in particular for the transverse radii shows that a radial flow interpretation cannot be easily inferred. A linear dependence with dN/d\u03b7 1/3 is expected for the HBT radii. Fig. 9 shows the direct comparison between elementary and 'compound' systems: different slopes and offsets for pp and heavy ions are observed and the size of the pp emitting source is \u2248 1 fm. The linear fits show qualitative agreement with hydrodynamical models, though the trends inferred by other lower energies heavy ions data are not in agreement with R G out . Global event characterization was also studied measuring fluctuations of p T in pp collisions. This observable is expected to be dominated by resonance decays, Bose-Einstein correlations and mini-jets. We study fluctuations of p T event-by-event over all tracks pairs, via a particle correlator C m defined as a function of the number of accepted tracks. For purely statistical fluctuations this observable is expected to have a null value. Once the values are normalized to the p T which is different at different collision energies, the relative fluctuations appear to be universal at LHC (except at small multiplicity) and not null, as seen in Fig. 10. Fig.11 shows comparisons with Monte Carlo at \u221a s=7 TeV: PYTHIA Perugia-0 tune describes the data well except for low multiplicity, while PHOJET significantly overestimates the observed pattern.",
