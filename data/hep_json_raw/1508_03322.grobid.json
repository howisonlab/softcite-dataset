The analysis features a comprehensive optimization of the neutrino weighting method to minimize the statistical uncertainties. We also improve the calibration of jet energies using the calibration determined in tt \u2192 lepton + jets events, which reduces the otherwise limiting systematic uncertainty from the jet energy scale.

In addition, m t is linked to the W and Higgs boson masses, M W and M H , through radiative corrections [3]. Following the Higgs boson discovery [4,5], a precise measurement of m t provides a test of the electroweak sector of the SM and information on whether our universe resides in a stable or metastable region of that theory [6][7][8]. The short lifetime of the top quark prevents its confinement in the strong color field, since top quarks decay before hadronizing. This allows a particularly precise study of pure quantum chromodynamic (QCD) effects. A comparison of the measured m t and the m t extracted from cross section mea-surements [9][10][11][12] may provide a probe of higher order and soft QCD corrections to the observed mass [13].",

Dilepton (2 , = e or \u03bc) events, such as ee, e\u03bc, and \u03bc\u03bc, with neutrinos from two W \u2192 \u03bd decays, are relatively rare but have low background. We present a measurement of m t using pp collider data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 , in events with two high-p T electrons or muons of opposite electric charge. Two high-p T jets must also be observed, one of which must be identified as being consistent with originating from a b quark. This analysis is based on our previous dilepton measurement [14], but with increased integrated luminosity and multiple optimizations to improve the precision of m t . We reduce the dominant statistical contribution to the uncertainty on m t through an optimization of the methods for kinematic reconstruction and statistical analysis. Lacking a dijet signature from W \u2192 qq , which is present in tt \u2192 lepton + jets ( + jets) events and was used to improve the precision of jet energy calibration with a W mass constraint [15], previous dilepton analyses at the Tevatron have reached a sensitivity limit imposed by standard jet calibration methods [16,17]. Progress in calibrating jet energies in the dilepton channel [14] provides improved cross-checks across different channels and a more significant contribution from the dilepton channel to the world average m t [18]. For comparison, the most recent measurements of m t in the dilepton channel from CDF, ATLAS, and CMS are, respectively, m t = 171.5 \u00b1 1.9(stat) \u00b1 2.5(syst) GeV [19], m t = 173.79 \u00b1 0.54(stat) \u00b1 1.30(syst) GeV [20], and m t = 172.50 \u00b1 0.43(stat) \u00b1 1.46(syst) GeV [21]. In this analysis, we substantially reduce the otherwise dominant uncertainty in the jet energy scale by applying the methods of Ref. [14].",

Muons must satisfy requirements that match hits in the muon system to a track in the central tracking detector that is required to have a small distance of closest approach to the beam axis [26]. We require hits in the muon layers inside and outside the toroid. Muons and charged hadron momenta are measured in the central tracking detector, while electron, photon (\u03b3 ), jet, and charged hadron energies are measured in the calorimeters. Muons must be isolated from jets and from nearby tracks. Electrons and muons must have their extrapolated track trajectories isolated from calorimeter energy depositions greater than an energy threshold. Electrons and muons must have p T > 15 GeV, and |\u03b7| < 2.5 and < 2.0, respectively. We reconstruct jets using an iterative, midpoint-seeded cone algorithm with a cone parameter of R cone = 0.5 [27]. Jets with embedded muons from the decay of b-hadrons require an additional correction to jet energy to account for the associated neutrino. A multivariate discriminant [28] is used to identify jets that contain a b-hadron (i.e., b jets) from a vertex displaced from the interaction point. We define the missing transverse momentum (/ E T ) attributed to the escaping neutrinos as the negative of the vector sum of all transverse components of calorimeter cell energies, corrected for the measured muon momenta and the response of the calorimeter to electrons. We also correct / E T for detector response in the jet energy calibration, as described below. Details of object reconstruction are provided in Ref. [29].",

We correct for the effects of the calorimeter response to particle constituents of jets, energy leaking into the cone from particles directed outside it, as well as energy deposits outside the cone from particles inside it [30]. Charged hadrons have an energy-dependent response that is lower than that of electrons and photons. We therefore apply corrections obtained from \u03b3 + jet events to account for the energy dependence of the jet response in the central |\u03b7| region. We also apply a relative \u03b7-dependent correction obtained from \u03b3 + jet and dijet events. We employ the same methods to calibrate jet energies independently in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and in data. The MC is used to help study potential biases in the data. We incorporate a correction for jets in the MC simulation that accounts for the difference in single-particle response between data and MC. This procedure ensures that the flavor dependence of the jet response in data is replicated in MC. In the MC we account for multiple pp interactions by correcting the jet energy to the particle level of only those particles that are directed within the jet cone at particle level. The typical systematic uncertainty in the energy calibration of each jet in the dilepton sample is 2%. This precision is limited by systematic uncertainties of the \u03b3 + jet method in the p T range of jets in tt events. Details about this \"standard jet energy scale\" calibration can be found in Ref. [30]. We require that jets have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 after calibration, but before applying additional corrections from the W \u2192 qq constraint in the + jets channel discussed below.",

[14], we apply a multiplicative correction factor to the energy of jets in data based on an analysis of tt \u2192 + jets events using the W \u2192 qq decays as a constraint. Application of this factor, 1.0250 \u00b1 0.0046 (stat) [15], improves the agreement between MC and data and allows us to use its uncertainty to reduce the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale by a factor of \u2248 4 relative to the standard jet energy scale, while retaining its \u03b7 and p T dependence. To apply this scale, which comes from light-quark jets, to the dilepton sample, which has b jets, it is important to ensure that the variation in the ratio of data over MC jet response between different flavors be placed on an equal footing. The standard jet energy scale [30] achieves this on a jet-by-jet basis by using single particles in MC jets to correct the simulation so that it has the same kinematic and flavor-dependent jet response as that in data. This ensures that the energies of b jets in dilepton simulated samples agree with those of b jets in the dilepton data sample at the same level as light-quark jets. Aside from fragmentation differences between data and MC which are discussed below, this approach justifies the use of the + jets constraint in the dilepton channel.",

We require two isolated leptons with opposite electric charge. We require at least two jets, where at least one of the two jets with highest p T must be identified as a b jet. For the e\u03bc channel, our selections have an efficiency for tagging b jets of 72%, and a light-quark mistag rate of 12% in the central region in \u03b7.

However, the correlation is substantially greater, and \u03bc \u03c9 values are less biased, when the correct jet assignments and solutions of neutrino momenta are chosen. Since now m t has been measured with high precision [18], we can optimize the range of m h t based on known values of m t . Considering a wide range in m h t causes incorrect configurations to overwhelm the correct configuration, thereby worsening the mass resolution. Likewise, scanning over too narrow a range biases the background and worsens the mass sensitivity by causing tt and background distributions to be similar. Examination of a two-dimensional grid of upper and lower limits of the mass range yields the optimal range of m h t = 115 to 220 GeV in 1 GeV steps. The value of \u03c3 / E T also has a noticeable impact on the expected precision of the analysis. This was not the case in Ref. [14], mainly because the final top quark mass measurement was less precise. In Ref. [14], the value of 7 GeV for \u03c3 / E T was obtained as the unclustered / E T resolution in an earlier dataset [36], where the unclustered / E T is the magnitude of the vector sum of all energy depositions in the calorimeter that are not included in lepton or jet reconstruction. However, accounting only for the unclustered energy resolution as the origin of the difference between the calculated and measured / E T ignores the effect of assumptions that go into the kinematic reconstruction. For instance, the finite binning of the neutrino rapidities discretizes the solved neutrino momenta and therefore the solved / E T . Also, the solved / E T does not include additional jets, reconstructed or not, since only the two leading jets are considered in the kinematic reconstruction. Due to these additional contributions, a scan in a wide range from 7 to 100 GeV is performed and we find the optimal value for \u03c3 / E T to be 25 GeV, which is larger than the 7 GeV of Ref. [14]. Combined, these optimizations improve the expected combined statistical uncertainty on m t by 11% compared to the parameters in Ref. [14].",

The energies of jets are shifted up and down by the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale, which is taken from + jets events, thereby providing shifts in m t . This scale is appropriate for light-quark jets, which, after correcting for jet flavors to improve the agreement between data and MC, have different kinematic distributions than b jets from tt decays. We calculate a residual uncertainty due to the kinematic differences between the + jets calibration sample and dilepton sample of b jets. We use separate up and down estimates to extract the energy-and \u03b7-dependent shifts in m t based on uncertainties in the standard jet energy scale relative to their average value in the + jets calibration sample. We cross-check this with an alternative method that applies shifted light-quark jet energy scales to b jets in the + jets channel [15]. These methods agree, and thereby validate the use of the + jets scale as a jet calibration. We also cross-check using a jet-energy-dependent linear parameterization of the residual jet energy scale as in Ref. [15], obtaining results that do not exceed our estimate of uncertainties from the jet energy scale. To estimate the uncertainty corresponding to possible differences in the flavor dependence of the MC scale relative to data, we change the single-particle responses up and down by their uncertainties and obtain the shift in m t . To estimate the possible dependence on the b quark fragmentation in the MC, we replace the pythia b quark fragmentation function with the Bowler scheme [37], and compare m t with the Bowler free parameters tuned to LEP (ALEPH, OPAL, and DELPHI) or SLD data [38].",

We therefore compare an ensemble of pseudo-experiments using mc@nlo 3.4 [39] tt events with one using alpgen events, where both employ herwig 6.510 [40] for modeling of hadronization. To evaluate the uncertainty associated with the modeling of initial and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR), we compare alpgen+pythia with the renormalization and factorization scale changed up and down by a factor of 1.5 [15]. The + jets analysis exhibits a discrepancy in the shape of the p T distribution of the tt system, which, although the dilepton statistics are limited, may be present in the dilepton sample. We evaluate the uncertainty in the modeling of the tt p T distribution by reweighting MC events to make them match the data. The observed shift in m t is taken as the uncertainty. Since the hadronization in our standard tt sample is modeled with pythia, we estimate a hadronization uncertainty on m t by performing pseudo-experiments using an alpgen+herwig sample. We evaluate the effect of color reconnection by comparing m t measurements in alpgen+pythia samples with two pythia tunes: the Perugia2011 tune that incorporates an explicit color-reconnection scheme, and the Perugia2011 NOCR tune that does not [41]. Data and MC may have different distributions in instantaneous luminosity after event selection. This uncertainty due to multiple pp interactions is estimated by reweighting the distribution of instantaneous luminosity to make MC agree with the data for respective data-taking epochs, and then take the shift in m t with respect to the default value. The uncertainty due to the proton structure is obtained from the 20 sets of CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDF) reweighted to CTEQ6M, where the deviations in m t for the 20 eigenvectors sets are added in quadrature [42]. We estimate the effect of the uncertainty on the fraction of signal or background by changing the expected tt event yields (n S ) up and down and the expected background yields (n B ) down and up within their total uncertainties. The heavy-flavor scale factor, which is applied to the Z \u2192 2 cross section to correct the heavyflavor content, is also changed up and down within its uncertainty to estimate its systematic effect on m t .",
