In the 1960's, Deep Inelastic Scattering experiments showed that protons and neutrons had internal structure: quarks and gluons (collectively, partons), and later experiments showed that the parton momentum distributions are different in heavy nuclei, compared to those in free nucleons. This difference is not surprising; partons are sensitive to their environment, and two gluons from different nucleons may fuse together, for example.",

Recent measurements have provided us with an improved understanding of how quark and gluon densities are altered in heavy nuclei. We have also begun to make multidimensional pictures of the nucleus, exploring how these alterations are distributed within heavy nuclei. We naturally expect these modifications to be largest in the core of a nucleus, and smaller near its periphery; this can change the effective shape of the nucleus. We have also started to explore the transverse momentum distribution of the partons in the nuclei, and, using incoherent photoproduction as a probe, study event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon and nuclei parton densities.",

            "text": "In a simple picture, atomic nuclei are made up of identical protons and neutrons, which are themselves made up of quarks and gluons. Each nucleon comprises three up or down valence quarks, plus virtual gluons and sea quarks and antiquarks. The gluons and sea quarks and antiquarks are ephemeral, flickering in and out of existence [1]. The quarks and gluons are defined in terms of parton (quark or gluon) distribution functions, q(x, Q 2 ) and g(x, Q 2 ), where x is the Bjorken momentum fraction -the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by that parton, measured in the infinite momentum frame -and Q 2 is the momentum scale at which the measurement is made. The larger the Q 2 , the more detailed the picture. For example, a gluon observed at one Q 2 might have fluctuated into a quark-antiquark pair when viewed at higher Q 2 . Thus, the quark and gluon distributions evolve with changing Q 2 .",

Quarks and gluons in a nucleon are sensitive to their nuclear environment, so the parton distribution in an isolated proton changes when that proton is inserted into a heavy nucleus, where the quark and gluons from adjacent nucleons are in close proximity. Figure 1 shows schematically that there are several different types of modifications to nuclear parton distribu-10 - 4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 tions, occurring at different x values. At small-x values, interactions reduce the parton densities, a process known as shadowing. But, due to momentum conservation, if there is nuclear shadowing, there must also be a nuclear enhancement at some other x (antishadowing). For the experimentally observed suppression at relatively large x (EMC effect) there is as yet no fully accepted theoretical explanation [4], but short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations are a promising explanation [5]. Finally, the enhancement at x \u223c 1 is due to the motion of nucleons in the nucleus.",

Leptons interact electromagnetically, so DIS only probes the electrically charged quarks. The gluon densities must be inferred, often by studying how the quarks evolve with the scale Q 2 set by the virtuality of the exchanged photon. The scale (Q 2 ) dependence of the parton distributions can be calculated by using perturbative QCD (pQCD), but the extraction of the full distributions requires a fit to experimental data. Current fits work at next-to-leading (or even next-to-next-to-leading) order in pQCD. Several such fits exist for protons [7,8] and for protons plus nuclei [9]. The commonly used EPPS16 fit [10] fits for the nuclear modifications to the CT series fits [8]. Most of these fits use both DIS data and data on selected hadronic processes at RHIC and the LHC. The extraction of parton densities from hadronic processes is subject to significant theoretical uncertainties.",

The simplest dipole-nucleus interaction is single gluon exchange, so the lowest-order cross-section is directly proportional to the gluon distribution. Single gluon exchange leads to final state such as dijets or mesons containing heavy quarks. The ATLAS collaboration recently made measurements of dijet production in photon-lead collisions [15]. Single gluons carry color, but the final state particles must be color neutral. So the reaction requires an additional separate gluonic string between the target and final state. When this string breaks, it forms mesons and, in the process, generally dissociates the target. These reactions are experimentally complex, requiring the reconstruction of many-particle final states and accounting for missing momentum due to unseen particles. To avoid these complications, most experimental analyses study simpler reactions such as coherent (Fig.  2c) or incoherent (Fig. 2d) photoproduction. In the coherent case, the final state is exclusive. Even in incoherent photoproduction, the nuclear breakup often leads to relatively simple final states in which the produced vector meson is clearly separated from the nuclear remnants.",

UPCs are interactions that occur at large impact parameters (ion-ion separations), so there are no hadronic interactions to overshadow the electromagnetic processes. The photons come from the electromagnetic fields of the nuclei [20]. The photon flux scales as the square of the nuclear charge, so high \u03b3A luminosities can be reached, even for moderate AA luminosities. In the target nucleus rest frame, the maximum photon energy is about 2\u03b3 2 c/R A , where \u03b3 is the lab-frame Lorentz boost of one beam and R A is the radius of a nucleus with atomic number A. At the LHC, target-frame photon energies up to several PeV (10 15 eV) are accessible, depending on nuclear species, corresponding to \u03b3A center of mass energies up to about 1 TeV. This allows access to gluons with x down to a few 10 \u22126 [21]. The photon energy k can be inferred from the mass (M ) and rapidity (y) of the final state via k = M V c 2 /2 exp (\u00b1y).",

The simplest way to quantify the magnitude of nuclear effects is to compare the observed \u03b3 + Pb \u2192 J/\u03c8 + Pb cross section to the corresponding cross section off proton targets measured at HERA scaled to the photon-nucleus case by taking into account the nuclear geometry and assuming that there are no additional nuclear effects. This estimate is compared with the CMS measurement [38] in Fig. 3. The suppression is a factor of \u2248 1/3 compared to the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation neglects shadowing and other nuclear effects, but does include coherence, so the forward scattering cross-section scales as A 2 . The experimental suppression is a clear sign of nuclear effects in the This suppression can be related to the nuclear shadowing. As discussed in Ref. [39], the observed suppression is compatible with expectations based on nuclear parton distribution fits like EPPS16 [10], assuming that the coherent cross section scales like gluon distribution squared as in Eq.

            "text": "where F (b) is the two dimensional profile of the interaction sites, J 0 is a Bessel function and \u2212t max the maximum t used. There are two important caveats. First, d\u03c3 coh /dt exhibits diffractive minima. The sign of the coherent production amplitude changes when crossing these minima. To account for these changes, the sign of d\u03c3 coh /dt should be flipped when crossing them. Second, this relationship is exact for t max = \u221e, but experimental data inevitably has a finite reach in t. Cutting off the transform at an experimentally determined t max will introduce artifacts in the transform. Understanding and minimizing these artifacts is a significant open challenge. The STAR Collaboration made a first measurement of F (b), using 294,000 photoproduced \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . They determine the coherent cross-section by first subtracting the background (like-sign pairs) and then subtracting the incoherent photoproduction, as determined from a a dipole form factor fit to d\u03c3/dt, made at higher p T , where coherent production is negligible. The resulting d\u03c3 coh /dt is shown in Fig. 4. They then Fourier transformed the low \u2212t region to find the F (b) in Fig. 5. The shaded band shows the change in F (b) as \u2212t max is varied. The variation is large at small |b|, but the edges of the nuclei are insensitive to the details of the transform. F (b) is negative at large |b|; this is due to a contribution from the other nucleus going in the other direction, which comes in with a negative sign [22,23]. The dipions were produced by the decay of a state with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , and the relative rapidity of the two pions was determined by the decay angular distribution [49].",

One direct measure of the fluctuations is seen in incoherent photoproduction process in which the target dissociates. As shown in Eq. (4), the cross section for the incoherent vector meson production depends on the variance of the scattering amplitude, which itself measures the size of fluctuations at distance scale \u223c 1/ \u221a \u2212t in the target density profile. Since it takes some energy to excite a nucleus or a proton, in the limit t \u2192 0, incoherent interactions must disappear. This corresponds to distance scales much larger than the target, where no internal structure is visible. Experimentally, these processes are characterized by the presence of a rapidity gap (empty detector) between the dissociated target and the produced vector meson. In UPCs, at small \u2212t, coherent scattering dominates over incoherent, and so it may be difficult to separate out small \u2212t incoherent interactions. Nuclear breakup or proton dissociation can produce particles which go in the far forward region, where instrumentation may be sparse. In Pb-Pb UPCs, the ALICE Collaboration has obtained (t integrated) cross sections for both processes with moderate accuracy [37]. In electron-ion collisions, detection of the scattered lepton will help ensure that the entire event is seen. Both coherent and incoherent J/\u03c8 production cross sections in electron-proton collisions were measured relatively accurately at HERA [52]. However, with the higher luminosities expected at future EICs, event pileup may become problematic. The cross-section to photodissociate a heavy nucleus at an EIC is quite high. Photodissociation can send neutrons in a forward calorimeter, but leave no other signal in the detector, since the electron energy loss is tiny [53]. These neutrons can cause coherent interactions to be mislabelled as incoherent.",

At small |t|, d\u03c3/dt is sensitive to long distance fluctuations, such as event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon positions from the Woods-Saxon average distribution [48]. Larger |t| events probe shorter distance scales, such as those from potential nucleon substructure fluctuations.

This is illustrated in Figure 8, where we show the predicted coherent and incoherent cross sections in ultraperipheral lead-lead collisions (i. e. photon-nucleus collisions) calculated with and without nucleon shape fluctuations in Ref.

Typical transverse momentum of the gluons in the nuclear wave function becomes of the order of Q s which increases with decreasing x or increasing energy (which is proposed [61,62] to explain the disappearance of the back-to-back correlation in forward dipion production at RHIC [63]). At high enough densities, this scale becomes large compared with the intrinsic QCD scale \u039b QCD , which allows perturbative calculations as \u03b1 s (Q 2 s ) 1. As gluon densities rise with decreasing x, nuclei become increasingly absorptive, and only very small qq dipoles, either from high Q 2 photons or the small-dipole extrema from real photons, will be able to penetrate the nucleus.

Air showers with energies up to 3 \u00d7 10 20 eV have been observed [83]. These showers are observed with air fluorescence detectors, which measure the spatial development of the resulting particle shower, with surface detectors which study the particles reaching the surface, and with buried muon detectors. Interpreting these data requires a model of hadronic air shower development. This is critically important for studies of the cosmic-ray composition, where we try to determine, based on these observables, whether the incident nucleus is a proton or heavier nucleus. The speed with which the shower develops as it propagates through the atmosphere depends on the interaction cross-section, and on the characteristics of these interactions, particularly the inelasticity, the fraction of its incident momentum retained by the incident particle, and on the number of lower energy particles produced in each collision. Current models fail, in that they tend to predict fewer ground-level muons than are seen in the data [84,85].",

Although this data does provide some significant constraints, there are many ways to tune the simulations to better match the data, and the LHCf does not point to a unique solution. It is also difficult to accurately scale in energy and to interpolate between pp and pP b collisions to understand oxygen and nitrogen targets. A more first-principles based approach is desirable.",

This could affect the altitude at which showers from a given incident nucleus reach their maximum extent [87]. If nuclei look like black disks at sufficiently low x, then this would also impact shower development, leading to an increase in interaction inelasticity -the incident particle would retain more energy -and making the shower develop more gradually.

Open charm is of particular interest because it can be probed down to lower masses, so is sensitive to partons at lower x and Q 2 than dijets. Together, these measurements should give us a reasonably clear picture of shadowing at low and moderate x values. Studies involving an intermediate nucleus will be important in understanding how shadowing evolves with atomic number. A proposed proton-oxgyen run would be particularly useful for cosmic-ray studies [94]. The dijet data should enable the first measurements of the Wigner distribution.",
