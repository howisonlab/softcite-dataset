            "text": "The dark photon, A , and the dark Higgs boson, h , are hypothetical constituents featured in a number of recently proposed Dark Sector Models. Assuming prompt decays of both dark particles, we search for their production in the so-called Higgs-strahlung channel, e + e \u2212 \u2192 A h , with h \u2192 A A . We investigate ten exclusive final-states with A \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , in the mass ranges 0.1 GeV/c 2 < m A < 3.5 GeV/c 2 and 0.2 GeV/c 2 < m h < 10.5 GeV/c 2 . We also investigate three inclusive final-states, 2(e + e \u2212 )X, 2(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )X, and (e + e \u2212 )(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )X, where X denotes a dark photon candidate detected via missing mass, in the mass ranges 1.1 GeV/c 2 < m A < 3.5 GeV/c 2 and 2.2 GeV/c 2 < m h < 10.5 GeV/c 2 . Using the entire 977 fb \u22121 data set collected by Belle, we observe no significant signal. We obtain individual and combined 90% credibility level upper limits on the branching fraction times the Born cross section, B \u00d7 \u03c3Born, on the Born cross section, \u03c3Born, and on the dark photon coupling to the dark Higgs boson times the kinetic mixing between the Standard Model photon and the dark photon, \u03b1D \u00d7 2 . These limits improve upon and cover wider mass ranges than previous experiments. The limits from the final-states 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and 2(e + e \u2212 )X are the first placed by any experiment. For \u03b1D equal to 1/137, m h < 8 GeV/c 2 , and m A < 1 GeV/c 2 , we exclude values of the mixing parameter, , above \u223c 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Recent results from dedicated dark-matter searches [1][2][3], muon-spin precession measurements [4], and spacebased particle observatories [5][6][7] may be interpreted as deviations from the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Attempts at devising unified explanations have led to Dark Sector Models (DSM) that introduce a new hidden or dark U (1) interaction that imbues dark matter with a novel charge . A possible mediator of this new Abelian force is the dark photon, which has an expected mass of the order of MeV/c 2 -GeV/c 2 and has a very small kinetic mixing with the Standard Model photon, , of the order of 10 \u22125 -10 \u22122 [13]. The dark U(1) symmetry group could be spontaneously broken, by a Higgs mechanism, adding a dark Higgs boson h (or several of these) to such models [24].",

            "text": "Due to the small coupling to SM particles and the low expected mass of the dark photon, the ideal tools to discover the dark photon and the dark Higgs boson are low energy and high-luminosity experiments such as Belle at KEKB, Belle II at SuperKEKB [24], BaBar at PEP-II [29,30], and dedicated fixed target and beam dump experiments, several of which are planned or under construction [31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. This article focuses on the Higgsstrahlung channel, e + e \u2212 \u2192 A h . Generally, the dark photon A can decay into lepton pairs, hadrons, or invisible particles while the dark Higgs boson h can decay into either A A ( * ) , leptons pairs, or hadrons, where A * is a virtual dark photon. The decay modes of the A and h depend on their masses and decay lengths [24,38]. There are three main cases: (a) m h < m A : h is long-lived and decays to lepton pairs or hadrons, (b) m A < m h < 2m A : h \u2192 A A * , where A * decays into leptons, and (c) m h > 2m A : h \u2192 A A . This article is concerned with case (c); in particular, we investigate ten exclusive final-states of type 3(l",

KLOE and BaBar have reported searches for the dark photon and the dark Higgs boson [29,39]: KLOE focused on m h < m A and BaBar on m h > 2m A (assuming prompt decays of the A and h ), but no signal was found in either case. BaBar set limits on the product \u03b1 D \u00d7 2 (where 2 = \u03b1 /\u03b1 em and \u03b1 em is the SM electromagnetic coupling constant) for dark photon and dark Higgs boson mass ranges of 0.25 -3.0 GeV/c 2 and 0.8 -10.0 GeV/c 2 , respectively. Beam dump experiments [40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] have placed 90% confidence level upper limits on for the processes e \u2212 p \u2192 A X and pp \u2192 A X (where X is not identified) of < 10 \u22124 for a dark photon mass range of 1 -300 MeV/c 2 . Recently, BaBar [30] set an upper limit of < 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for a dark photon mass range of 0.3 -10 GeV/c 2 for the radiative decay process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3A . The advantage of the Higgs-strahlung channel compared to the radiative decay is that the Quantum Electrodynamic (QED) background is expected to be much smaller. If, in addition, the coupling between the dark photon and the dark Higgs boson is of order unity, then the Higgsstrahlung channel is the most sensitive probe for the dark photon.",

These limits improve upon and cover wider mass ranges than previous experiments and the limits in the final-states 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and 2(e + e \u2212 )X, where X is a dark photon candidate detected via missing mass, are the first limits placed by any experiment. For \u03b1 D equal to 1/137, m h < 8 GeV/c 2 , and m A < 1 GeV/c 2 , we exclude values of the mixing parameter, , above \u223c 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . In the mass ranges, and for modes, where previous measurements from BaBar exist, the limits reported here are almost a factor of two smaller. Since the backgrounds are very low to non-existent, the improvement scales nearly linearly with the integrated luminosity. This bodes well for future searches with Belle II.",
