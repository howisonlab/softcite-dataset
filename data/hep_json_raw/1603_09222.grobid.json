This factor, defined before the decay leptons emit photons via final-state radiation (Born-level FSR), includes the efficiencies for triggering on, reconstructing, and identifying the W \u00b1 and Z -boson decay products within the acceptance, and also accounts for the slight difference between the fiducial and reconstructed phase spaces. The production cross sections defined without the acceptance factors (\u03c3 tot \u2022 A) are referred to as the fiducial cross sections (\u03c3 fid Theoretical predictions of the fiducial and total cross sections are computed using DYNNLO 1.5 [4,5] for the central value and Fewz 3.1 [1,[6][7][8] for all variations reflecting systematic uncertainties, thereby providing full NNLO QCD calculations. The NLO EW corrections are calculated with Fewz 3.1 for Z bosons and with the Monte Carlo program Sanc [9,10] for W \u00b1 bosons. The calculation is done in the G \u03bc EW scheme [11]. The cross sections are calculated for vector-boson decays into leptons at Born level, to match the definition of the C factor used in Eq. (1) for the determination of the measured cross sections in the data. Thus, from complete NLO EW corrections the following components are included: virtual QED and weak corrections, initial-state radiation (ISR) and interference between ISR and FSR [12]. For the Z -boson production, all the predictions include the 66 < m < 116 GeV requirement. The NNLO PDFs CT14nnlo [13], NNPDF3.0 [14], MMHT14nnlo68CL [15], ABM12 [16], HERAPDF2.0nnlo [17], and ATLAS-epWZ12nnlo [18] are used in the comparisons to data, although CT14nnlo is used as the baseline for the predictions.",

These uncertainties are obtained from the sum in quadrature of the differences between the central PDF values and the eigenvectors of the respective PDF sets. Where appropriate, asymmetric uncertainties are determined using separate sums of negative and positive variations. The CT14nnlo uncertainties (rescaled from 90% to 68% confidence level (CL)) are used in the comparison to the measured cross sections in Table 3 of Section 7. The QCD scale uncertainties are defined by the symmetrised envelope of variations in which the renormalisation (\u03bc R ) and factorisation (\u03bc F ) scales are changed by factors of two with an additional constraint of 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc R /\u03bc F \u2264 2. The dynamic scale m and fixed scale m W are used as the central values for the Z boson and W \u00b1 boson predictions, respectively. A significant component of these scale uncertainties originates from the statistical precision of the integration method used to evaluate the variations. The other systematic uncertainties under consideration (labelled as \"other\" in Table 3) are as follows. The uncertainties due to the strong coupling constant are estimated following the prescription given with the CT14nnlo PDF, varying \u03b1 S by \u00b10.001 to correspond to 68% CL. The beam energy is assumed to be known to 1% (from Ref. [19], 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).",

The CT10 PDF set [30] is used in the matrix element and the AZNLO [31] set of generator-parameter values (tune) is used, with PDF set CTEQ6L1 [32], for the modelling of non-perturbative effects. The EvtGen v.1.2.0 program [33] is used for properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays, and Photos++ version 3.52 [34,35] is used for QED emissions from electroweak vertices and charged leptons. Samples of top-quark pair (tt) and singletop-quark production are generated with the Powheg-Box v2 generator, which uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO matrix element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4. For all top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations are preserved. The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event are simulated using Pythia 6.428 with the CTEQ6L1 PDF sets and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [36].

The first fit region is defined as the full event selection but removing the m T requirement, and the second one is defined as the full event selection but removing the E miss T requirement. Several multijet-enriched data samples (multijet templates) are built from events passing all selection requirements in each fit region except lepton isolation. Mutually exclusive requirements (\"intervals\") in either tracking-or calorimeter-based isolation variables are chosen to create statistically independent multijet templates. These samples are designed to be progressively closer to the signal-candidate selection by fixing one of the isolation criteria to that of the signal region and varying the other one; four such samples are built for each isolation type in the electron channel and four (for tracking-based isolation) or six (for calorimeter-based isolation) in the muon channel. Templates are similarly constructed from simulation for W \u00b1 signal and electroweak and top-quark backgrounds, to account for potential contaminations in the multijet template. For each isolation interval, the normalisation of the multijet template is extracted with a maximum-likelihood fit to the data in the two fit regions and separately for each one of the discriminant variables and charged lepton samples. In each fit region, the normalisation of the signal template derived from simulation is left free to float while the remaining background templates are normalised to their expected values, based on the measured integrated luminosity and the predicted cross sections (but are permitted to vary within 5% of their expected values, as described in Section 3). It was verified that the value of the signal normalisation extracted from this fit has no significant impact on the multijet estimate. Fig. 1. The number of multijet events versus the isolation variable for the W \u2192 e\u03bd (left) and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd (right) analysis is shown. The plots illustrate the multijet-evaluation methodology for the W + analysis. The results obtained for two of the four discriminant variables used to evaluate the multijet yields are shown for both types of isolation: m T (circles) and p T (squares) with calorimeter-based isolation and m T (triangles) and p T (stars) with track-based isolation. Open markers represent the yields obtained with the E miss T fit region while closed markers are those with the m T fit region. The points represent the extracted multijet fraction from the fit of the variables, in the isolation intervals represented on the x-axis for the template selection. The lines represent the linear extrapolation of the points to the signal region. The definition of the signal region is p T and isolation-flavour dependent but corresponds approximately to the region of isolation below 0.1 in these plots. The error bar in each bin represents the uncertainty from the fit of the variable rescaled by the square root of the reduced \u03c7 2 of the fit.",

A particle with reconstructed charge opposite to the parent electron may then accidentally be associated with the calorimeter cluster. The effect of electrons having their charge reconstructed wrongly is studied using a control sample of Z \u2192 ee events in which both electrons are reconstructed with the same charge and is found to be well described by the Monte Carlo simulation, within the statistical uncertainty of the control sample. An uncertainty is assessed to cover any small residual differences between data and simulation. The probability of charge misidentification is negligible in the muon channel. In the Z -boson channel, the systematic uncertainties from the background evaluation contribute negligibly to the experimental cross-section uncertainty.

The datasets for electron and muon decay channels are then combined using a methodology which accounts for the correlations of the experimental systematic uncertainties. The measured fiducial and total cross sections are found to agree with theoretical calculations based on NNLO QCD with NLO EW corrections. These measured cross sections have a global luminosity uncertainty of 2.1%, while their remaining experimental uncertainties in the W \u00b1 and Z -boson channels are found to be just under 3% and 1%, respectively. The measurements of cross-section ratios benefit from the cancellation of some experimental uncertainties, and are powerful tools to constrain PDF fits.",
