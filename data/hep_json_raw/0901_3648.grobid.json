            "text": "The HARP experiment arose from the realization that the inclusive differential cross-sections of hadron production in the interactions of low-momentum protons with nuclei were known only within a factor of two to three, while more precise cross-sections are in demand for several reasons, notably for the design of the proton driver of a neutrino factory, for the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux, for the flux predictions of conventional neutrino beams, and for the modelling of Monte Carlo generators of hadron-nucleus collisions. Consequently, the HARP detector was designed to carry out a programme of systematic and precise measurements of hadron production by protons and pions with momenta from 1.5 to 15 GeV/c. It is shown schematically in The detector extended longitudinally over 14.7 m and combined a forward spectrometer with a large-angle spectrometer. The latter comprised a cylindrical Time Projection Chamber (TPC) around the target and an array of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) that surrounded the TPC. The purpose of the TPC was track reconstruction and particle identification by dE/dx. The purpose of the RPCs was to complement the particle identification by time of flight.",

The data analysis presented in this paper rests exclusively on the calibrations of the TPC and the RPCs that we, the HARP-CDP group, published in [1] and [2]. As discussed in [3] and [4], and succinctly summarized in this paper's Appendix, our calibrations disagree with calibrations published by the 'HARP Collaboration' [5][6][7][8]. Conclusions of independent review bodies on the discrepancies between our results and those from the HARP Collaboration can be found in [9,10].",

Most importantly, it features a smooth transition between the left and the right bend of high-p T tracks in the solenoidal magnetic field, and hence avoids a discontinuity in the assignment of a positive or negative charge-signed p T .

It is this virtual beam point, and not the real beam point, that is used in the (final) track fit. It is determined in an iterative procedure that starts from the fit of the track momentum in the TPC gas, including the real beam point. The fitted trajectory in the TPC gas is then backtracked to the beam particle trajectory taking the energy loss and multiple scattering into account. It renders a first estimate of the virtual beam point. Using this estimate, the track in the TPC gas is again fitted, and the procedure is iterated until the position of the virtual beam point is stable. Since in the calculation of the move from the real to the virtual beam point the energy loss is taken into account, and since the energy loss depends on the type of particle, three different virtual beam points are calculated according to the proton, pion, and electron hypotheses.
