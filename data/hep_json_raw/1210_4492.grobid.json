The measurement is performed in six bins of invariant mass squared of the \u00fe \u00c0 pair, excluding the J=c and c \u00f02S\u00de resonance regions. Production and detection asymmetries are removed using the B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 decay as a control mode. The integrated CP asymmetry is found to be \u00c00:072 AE 0:040\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:005\u00f0syst\u00de, consistent with the standard model.",

K \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \u00fe \u00c0 is a flavor changing neutral current process that proceeds via electroweak loop and box diagrams in the standard model (SM) [1]. The decay is highly suppressed in the SM and therefore physics beyond the SM such as supersymmetry [2] can contribute with a comparable amplitude via gluino or chargino loop diagrams. A number of observables are sensitive to such contributions, including the partial rate of the decay, the \u00fe \u00c0 forward-backward asymmetry (A FB ), and the CP asymmetry (A CP ).

The CP asymmetry is predicted to be of the order 10 \u00c03 in the SM [3,4] but is sensitive to physics beyond the SM that changes the operator basis by modifying the mixture of the vector and axial-vector components [5,6]. Some models that include new phenomena enhance the observed CP asymmetry up to AE0:15 [7]. The theoretical prediction within a given model has a small error as the form factor uncertainties, which are the dominant theoretical errors for the decay rate, cancel in the ratio. The CP asymmetry in B 0 ! K \u00c30 \u00fe \u00c0 decays has previously been measured by the Belle [8] and BABAR [9] collaborations, with both results consistent with the SM.

The quantity A D is dominated by the K \u00fe \u00c0 =K \u00c0 \u00fe detection asymmetry that arises due to left-right asymmetries in the LHCb detector and different interactions of positively and negatively charged tracks with the detector material. The left-right asymmetry is canceled by taking an average with equal weights of the CP asymmetries measured in two independent data samples with opposite polarities of the LHCb dipole magnet. These data samples correspond to 61% and 39% of the total data sample. The production and interaction asymmetries are corrected for using the B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 decay mode as a control channel. Since B 0 ! K \u00c30 \u00fe \u00c0 and B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 decays have the same final state and similar kinematics, the measured raw asymmetry for B ! J=c K \u00c30 decays may be simply expressed as A RAW \u00f0B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 \u00de \u00bc A P \u00fe A D , in the absence of a CP asymmetry. B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 proceeds via a b ! c\" cs transition, as does the decay mode B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe , and hence should have a CP asymmetry similar to A CP \u00f0B \u00fe !
