The analysis is performed with 20.3 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Events are required to contain at least two lepton-jets. This study finds no statistically significant deviation from predictions of the Standard Model and places 95% confidence-level upper limits on the contribution of new phenomena beyond the SM, incuding SUSY-portal and Higgs-portal models, on the number of events with lepton-jets.",

            "text": "In several models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) [1][2][3][4][5], the so-called dark matter (see e.g. ref. [6] and references therein) is charged under a non-Abelian, dark-sector, gauge symmetry that is broken at an energy scale O(1 GeV). The dark-sector ground state can transition to and from excited states via the emission of a dark gauge boson, referred to as the dark photon (\u03b3 d ), that couples very weakly to the SM particles via kinetic mixing [7] with the SM photon. In these models, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could produce excited dark-sector states via their interactions with particles found in models of supersymmetry (SUSY) [1,3] or with Higgs scalar bosons [4,5] (here referred to as SUSY-portal and Higgs-portal models, respectively), which then decay via the emission of dark photons. If dark photons carry masses of O(1 GeV), then the dark photon produced from the decay chain of heavier particles such as the SM Higgs boson or SUSY particles would be highly boosted. Depending on its mass, the dark photon would decay primarily into a collimated pair of leptons or light hadrons. The leptonic final-state is experimentally easier accessible, offering a distinct signature that stands out amongst large hadronic backgrounds. A collimated set of energetic leptons is referred to as a lepton-jet (LJ).",

The analysis focuses on dark photons with prompt-decays, i.e. consistent with zero decay length within the experimental resolution. Previous searches for prompt lepton-jets, with ATLAS data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, resulted in upper limits on the production of two lepton-jets in a SUSY-portal model [11] and for a Higgs-portal model [12]. The CMS and D0 collaborations also set upper limits on prompt lepton-jet production [13][14][15][16][17]. Related searches for non-prompt lepton-jets [18] have been performed by ATLAS and have set constraints on smaller values of the kinetic mixing parameter, \u2264 10 \u22125 . There are additional constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter and dark-photon mass, e.g. from beam-dump and fixed target experiments [9,[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27], e + e \u2212 collider experiments [28][29][30][31][32][33], electron and muon magnetic moment measurements [34,35] and astrophysical observations [36,37].",

In the Higgs-portal model (section 3.2), the SM Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark fermions, each of which decays into one or more dark photons in cascades. For both models, the dark photons decay into lepton pairs, that can be reconstructed as a lepton-jet, or light hadrons, depending on the branching fractions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples are produced for the two models. All signal MC events are processed with the Geant4-based ATLAS detector simulation [38,39] and then analysed with the standard ATLAS reconstruction software.

A MC generator tool, called the LJ gun [18], is used to generate these processes. For simplicity, the LJ gun samples are generated with only three dark-photon decay modes, e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and the branching ratios are assigned based on the mass of the dark photons. The BRs of the \u03b3 d are determined with a single \u03b3 d sample. The s d masses considered range from 1 GeV to 10 GeV. The generated events are processed through the full ATLAS Geant4-based simulation chain. Additional pp interactions in the same and nearby bunch crossings (pile-up) are included in the simulation. All Monte Carlo samples are re-weighted to reproduce the observed distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing in the data. The separation between the leptons depends on the mass and the boost of their parent \u03b3 d . Figure 3 shows the dependence of the average separation between muons, \u2206R, on the \u03b3 d or s d transverse momentum for various mass values. In the left figure, the average \u2206R is evaluated from the distribution for a given p T slice of \u03b3 d decaying into two truth 4 muons. In the right figure, the average \u2206R is evaluated from the distribution of six possible combinations of muon pairs from four muons for a given p T bin of s d decaying into \u03b3 d , where each \u03b3 d decays into a muon pair.

Longitudinally polarized (LP) dark photons [18] have a higher probability for the decay products to have unbalanced momenta than the transversely polarized (TP) ones. For eLJ, LP dark photons are more likely than TP ones to satisfy the p T > 10 GeV requirement as shown in figure 4. The slight decrease in muLJ efficiency at high p T in figure 5 is due to the smaller \u2206R of \u03b3 d decays along the \u03b3 d momentum direction. For higher p T \u03b3 d , the LP muLJ decay products are more often reconstructed as a single muon in the MS. As shown in figure 5 (right), for the double \u03b3 d case, the muLJ reconstruction efficiency improves with the dark-photon p T , as only one of the \u03b3 d needs to be reconstructed.",

The variable s represents the signal efficiency formed by the product of the LJ reconstruction efficiency (section 5.3), the efficiency of requirements on the discriminating variables and the LJ trigger efficiency. The optimized cuts for all LJ variables are given in table 2. The optimization is performed for the efficiency of two-LJ events, which is obtained from the product of single LJ efficiencies. The cut efficiency variation as a function of the dark-photon mass is studied for the eLJ-eLJ, muLJ-muLJ and eLJ-muLJ channels in case of 2\u03b3 d production. The variation is found to be small. For 2s d production the cut efficiency variation with the dark-photon mass can be large when one of the \u03b3 d originating from s d decays into hadrons and the other into a lepton-pair. The size of the variation in this case depends on the branching ratio for \u03b3 d decay to hadrons. Table 3 summarizes the signal acceptance \u00d7 efficiencies for the m \u03b3 d = 0.4 GeV benchmark, where efficiencies for events passing all the cuts are shown. These efficiencies take into account the trigger selection, primary vertex selection, lepton-jet reconstruction, and efficiencies of discriminating variable cuts, and do not include the BRs for \u03b3 d decays into e + e \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs in each channel. The difference between efficiencies for the Higgs-portal and SUSY-portal models are driven by the boost of the dark photon which depends on the mass of the parent particles, the squark or Higgs boson.

At m \u03b3 d = 0.7 GeV, the branching fraction of dark photons into lepton pairs is around 15% due to higher decay probabilities into \u03c1 and \u03c6 mesons, which is the reason why the signal expectation is small for this mass point.

Here c\u03c4 is the mean lifetime of the dark photon used in the simulation and the efficiency is the average efficiency for this mean lifetime. This efficiency scaling is shown in figure 11. A large number of pseudo experiments is generated for c\u03c4 ranging from 0-100 mm. The average efficiency ratios are obtained based on the lepton-jet efficiency dependence on the proper decay length.The average efficiency curves are valid for all channels. This is due to the B-layer hit requirements of at least two tracks in the lepton-jets, which makes the lepton-jet reconstruction efficiency vanish for all lepton-jets types with the proper decay length > 52 mm. Therefore there is no further impact due to the lepton-jet reconstruction, their selection cuts and the triggers requirements.",

A 45% uncertainty is assigned on the efficiency scaling based on a comparison of the extrapolated signal expectation at 47 mm c\u03c4 with the direct estimate of the expected signal for the dark-photon simulation sample generated with c\u03c4 = 47 mm. The extrapolated signal expectation is obtained by scaling the signal expectation for the dark-photon sample with c\u03c4 = 0 mm by the average efficiency ratio at c\u03c4 = 47 mm as given by the curve in figure 12. The decays of the dark photons into leptons are simulated with an exponential decay law. The limit is based on combined results from the eLJ-eLJ, muLJ-muLJ and eLJ-muLJ channels. The emuLJ channels are not used as they do not contribute to the H \u2192 2\u03b3 d +X topology, given that a single \u03b3 d cannot decay into a pair of leptons of different flavour. The comparison with the theoretical prediction (dashed line) for 10% BR of Higgs boson decay to two dark photons 5 shows that values of c\u03c4 below 3.2 mm are excluded at 95% confidence-level.  As the efficiency dependence is found to be small for the SUSY samples across various dark-photon mass points in the 2\u03b3 d + X topology, it is assumed for the Higgs-portal model that the efficiencies scale the same way as for the SUSY-portal samples with respect to 0.4 GeV dark-photon sample. Based on the variations in efficiencies across different darkphoton masses with respect to 0.4 GeV dark-photon sample, the following uncertainties are assigned to the efficiencies: 60% on the eLJ-eLJ channel, 200% on the muLJ-muLJ and 30% on the eLJ-muLJ channel.",

Figure 13 shows the 90% confidence-level exclusion contour interpreted in the and \u03b3 d mass plane in the region 10 \u22122 -10 \u22126 and in the mass region [0.1-2] GeV for 5%, 10%, 20%, 40% branching fractions of the Higgs boson decay to 2\u03b3 d + X. In the low-mass region, below the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 threshold, only the results from the eLJ-eLJ channel contribute. The results shown in the figure depend on the coupling of the dark photon to the SM photon , and on the mass of the dark photon. The figure also shows other excluded regions from a search for non-prompt lepton-jets at ATLAS [18] and from other experiments. Shown are existing 90% confidence-level exclusion regions from beam-dump experiments E137, E141, and E774 [20,21,62], Orsay [63], U70 [19], CHARM [64], LSND [26], A1 [23], the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moment [34,35,65], HADES [25], KLOE [28][29][30][31][32], the test-run results reported by APEX [22], an estimate using BaBar results [9,32,33], and constraints from astrophysical observations [36,37]. While other experiment's results are independent of the topology of the dark-photon production, the ATLAS results depend on the topology, i.e Higgs boson mass and its production mechanism, and its decay into dark photons. The results from CMS are shown elsewhere [15]. The values are evaluated using Equation (1.1) combined with R-ratio measurements of e + e \u2212 collider data [28][29][30][31][32][33], where the R-ratio is the ratio of the hadronic cross section to the muon cross section in electron-positron collisions.
