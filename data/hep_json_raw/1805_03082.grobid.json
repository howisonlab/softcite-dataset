However, direct evidence for such extra dimensions has not been found. Here we present a scheme to test the gravitational law in 4 + 2 dimensions at micron separations by optomechanical methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of the normal mode splitting in the optomechanical system under the gravitational interaction between two levitated resonators. The weak frequency splitting can be optically read by the optical pump-probe scheme. The sensitivity can be improved by suppressing the effect of the Casimir force coupling and the electrostatic interaction. Thus, we can detect the large extra dimensions at low noise levels based on the levitation optomechanics without the isoelectronic technique.",

This question can be recast in terms of the hierarchy problem, namely the seeming disparity (about 16 orders of magnitude) between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the Planck mass. This problem can be overcome by adding new dimensions in the large extra dimension (or the bulk) model, namely the ADD model, which was first developed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali [1][2][3]. They proposed that the extra dimensions could be as large as a millimeter and the measurements of gravity may observe the deviation from 1/r 2 Newtonian gravitation. Considering this possibility, they found that their model could Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6508-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. a e-mail: zhukadi@sjtu.edu.cn describe the hierarchy between the Planck mass and the standard model electroweak scale in terms of the large size of the extra dimensions.

Nano-and micromechanical devices can be coupled to optical cavities directly via radiation pressure, leading to a variety of important properties, such as optical self-focusing [15], optomechanical entanglement [16] and optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) [17,18]. Recently, many efforts have been made toward optically levitating nano-and micromechanical oscillators in ultrahigh vacuum, such as nanospheres [19,20], nanodiamonds [21,22], microdisk [23,24], and even living organisms [25]. The laser trapped objects have no physical contact with the environment and can lead to ultralow mechanical damping. In the absence of other noise sources, the quality factors of optical levitation can exceed 10 12 with pressures of 10 \u221210 Torr [19]. Owing to its exceptional mechanical properties, optical levitation appears to be an excellent candidate for the NRs in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMSs), which are of great interest for applications in fundamental science and precision measurement [26][27][28].",

The levitated microdisks are placed at the antinodes of cavity field with a separation of r 0 = 8\u00b5m. b Schematic of the energy-levels for the resonance mode splitting in the cavity reminds us of a practical application for precisely detecting large extra dimensions at micron separations. We also consider the Casimir effect as the main background force noise in the micro-scale optomechanical system. The constraints on the compactification distances are deduced as last, the superresolution can be achieved by using the oscillators with high Q factor in vacuum.

The resulting gradient in the optical field provides a sufficiently deep optical potential well, which allows the object to be confined in a number of possible trapping sites with precise localization [25,31,32]. A schematic of our setup is sketched in Fig. 1a, where two dielectric microdisks are optically levitated between the two fixed mirrors by applying two trapping lasers, respectively. A Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity consists of the left fixed mirror and the levitated microdisk 1 (the left one) which couples to the optical cavity field via radiation pressure. This cavity mode is driven by two light fields, one of which is the pump field with frequency \u03c9 pu and the other of which is the probe field with frequency \u03c9 pr as shown in Fig. 1a by the purple curve and green curve respectively. The mechanism can be explained as a quantum coupling induced normal mode splitting (NMS) in the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. Figure 1b is the energy level description of this process. In the present paper, the trapped microdisks are treated as quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillators and their masses are m 1 and m 2 , mechanical frequencies \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 , and damping rates \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 , respectively. The Hamiltonian can be regarded as H \u03c9 = j=1,2h \u03c9 j a + j a j , where a + j and a j are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for the two vibrational resonators. We use H c =h\u03c9 c c + c to describe the Hamiltonian of the cavity mode; here \u03c9 c and c(c + ) denote the oscillation frequency and the annihilation (creation) operator of the cavity.

At first we assume \u03b2 = \u03b2 Casimir = 0, then we get an enhanced peak which is located at \u03b4 = \u03c9 1 = 10 kHz; this just corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the levitated microdisk as shown by the black curve. Without the presence of extra dimensions (n = 0), we can only consider the Casimir coupling \u03b2 Casimir = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Hz. Then we find that the resonance peak suffers a splitting in the spectrum characterized by the blue curve. Now, let us consider the large extra dimensions induced by the coupling between the two microdisks based on ADD theory. For 4 + 2 dimensions, n = 2, we have \u03b2 = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Hz. The result shows that the resonance frequency splitting can be amplified significantly in the spectrum as shown by the red curve. Here the transmitted spectrum of the probe laser can be effectively modulated by the number of extra dimensions. Without any interaction, one can obtain significant transmission of the probe laser at the resonant region. When gravity deviates from 1/r 2 in 4 + 2 extra dimensions and also the Casimir background force is taken into account, the enhanced peak splits and separates. Therefore we can adjust the resonance frequencies of the levitated microdisks to 10 kHz by modulating the trapping laser power; then the extra dimensions can be detected by the vibrational mode splitting of the microdisk resonators experimentally.",

Compared to the previous experiments, a hybrid microresonatorcavity system with optical pump-probe scheme is introduced to detect the large extra dimensions in this paper. In our optical scheme, the Casimir background noise can be reduced by using a specific geometry such as the enhancement of the thickness. The electrostatic force can be eliminated by using the sensors with the consistent material and surface crystallographic directions. We list all the main optomechanical parameters in Table 1. The mechanism underlying these effects can be explained as FWM in a three-level system. The simultaneous presence of a pump field and a probe field generates a radiation pressure force at the beat frequency, which drives the motion of the oscillator near its resonance frequency. In Fig. 1b, we let |N , |n 1 and |n 2 denote the number states of the cavity photon, left microdisk phonons, and right microdisk phonons, respectively. The |N , n 1 , n 2 \u2194 |N + 1, n 1 , n 2 transition changes the cavity field. The initial energy level of the cavity photon |N , n 1 , n 2 is dressed by the mechanical modes |N , n 1 + 1, n 2 via the radiation pressure. Thus the |N + 1, n 1 , n 2 \u2194 |N , n 1 + 1, n 2 transition is caused by the radiation pressure coupling. The mechanical modes of the right levitated microdisk adds a fourth level |N , n 1 , n 2 + 1 . In the system, the energy level |N , n 1 + 1, n 2 can be mainly modified by the gravitational coupling between two resonators. The coupling breaks down the symmetry of the OMIT interference, the single OMIT transparency window is split into two transparency windows, which yields the quantum coupling induced NMS as shown in Fig. 2.

The result shows that the smaller linewidth can be achieved by increasing the Q factor of the levitated resonators. Figure 5 presents the constraints on R * for the number of extra dimensions, n = 1, 2, 3. The sloping lines represent the calculated coupling rate \u03b2 for different n and R * . We depict the horizontal dash black line to indicate the limits of the detectable coupling strength \u03b2 min . R * and \u03b2 are constrained to be larger than the values of the intersections in the picture. The solid lines in the figure represent the detectable parameter space, the dot lines represent the undetectable region. The arrow indicates that the sensitivity can be improved through the optomechanical oscillators with higher Q factors. Considering the minimum measurable gravitational coupling rate \u03b2 min = 0.1 mHz, we get the precision for the force measurement as F min = 300 aN. The Q factor of the optically trapped particles is limited only by collisions with residual air molecules, thus the sensitivity can be improved by decreasing the air pressure. The lower pressure limit of the sputter-ion pumps is in the range of 10 \u221211 mbar. Lower pressures in the range of 10 \u221212 mbar can only be achieved when the sputterion pump works in a combination with other pump methods [49,50]. In our considerations, a conservative value is taken, p = 10 \u22127 mbar, which is usually required for achieving ultrahigh-Q mechanical oscillators and the ultrasensitive measurements in the levitated optomechanical system [12,19,23,24,51]. If we choose a lower air pressure ( p = 10 \u221211 mbar), this scheme will obtain the FWHM in the spectrum with F W H M = 10 nHz, corresponding to the force sensitivity of F min = 0.2 aN. Our scheme yields 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement for the force sensing in the microscale [5].",

E c = m 1 \u03c9 2 1 x 2 c represents the maximum driving energy, x c is the maximum root mean square (rms) level. The resonator follows a predominantly linear response (Hooke's law) at this level. For a Gaussian field distribution, the nonlinear coefficients are given by \u03be = \u22122/W 2 [53], here W \u2248 75 \u00b5m is the trapping beam waist. For the displacements |x c | |\u03be | \u22121/2 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m the nonlinearity is negligible. In our considerations, x c is taken to be 2 orders of magnitude smaller, and we choose x c \u2248 10 \u22127 m. Considering the quality factor of the microdisk Q 1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10 8 at room temperature, we obtain \u03c9 min = 0.8 \u00b5Hz < \u03b2 min . Here we suppose the measurement bandwidth f = 10 \u22124 Hz, corresponding to the measurement time \u03c4 = 1600 s. The result shows that the thermomechanical noise can be controlled at a level lower than the claimed sensitivity. The phase noise presents a treatment of the problem of analyzing and measuring short-term frequency instabilities of the ultrastable oscillation. The Allen deviation is inversely proportional to the integration time. But a long integration time may increase the long-term instabilities due to the frequency drift from the environmental temperature changes and device aging and so on. An integration time of size of 1600 s is a good compromise between the two limit factors.",

Our study reports a design for probing gravitational deviation in the range of 8 \u00b5 m with the pumpprobe optical technology in cavity. Under the influence of non-Newtonian gravity, the transparency peak would show a distinct splitting in frequency space. We have shown that the coupling strength associated with such a hypothetical variation of gravity could be determined from a measurement of the splitting distance. The gravitational strength, characterized by the coupling strength \u03b2, can also be determined by the splitting distance L. The Casimir coupling rate is about 8 times smaller than the gravitational strength in the system. The different surface potentials can be attenuated efficiently in our scheme, providing the precision measurement in the Casimir regime without the isoelectronic technique. We also hope that the precision can be significantly enhanced by experiments in ultrahigh vacuum.",
