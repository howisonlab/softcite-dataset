The observation was followed by precision measurements of the mass, couplings, and CP quantum numbers of the new boson, which were found to be consistent with the predictions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics [10][11][12][13][14].",

            "text": "In this paper, a direct search for H \u00b1 decaying into a tau lepton and a neutrino is presented, based on data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The search is conducted in three different final states, labeled in this paper as the hadronic final state (\u03c4 h + jets, where \u03c4 h denotes a hadronically decaying tau lepton), the leptonic final state with a \u03c4 h ( + \u03c4 h ), and the leptonic final state without a \u03c4 h ( + no \u03c4 h ). For the hadronic final state, events contain a \u03c4 h , missing transverse momentum due to neutrinos, and additional hadronic jets from top quark decays and b quarks. The leptonic final state with a \u03c4 h contains a single isolated lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum, hadronic jets and a \u03c4 h . The leptonic final state without a \u03c4 h is defined in a similar way, except that events with a \u03c4 h are rejected. In the leptonic final states, the lepton can originate either from the decays of the tau leptons from H \u00b1 decays, or from a W \u00b1 boson decay.",

A transverse mass distribution is reconstructed in each category of each final state and used in a maximum likelihood fit to search for an H \u00b1 signal. The H \u00b1 mass range from 80 GeV to 3 TeV is covered in the search, including the intermediate mass range near m t . This paper is organized as follows. The CMS detector is briefly presented in section 2. The methods used in event simulation and reconstruction are described in sections 3 and 4, respectively. The event selection and categorization criteria are presented in section 5, while section 6 details the background estimation methods used in the analysis. Systematic uncertainties included in the analysis are described in section 7. Finally, the results are presented in section 8 and summarized in section 9.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| = 5. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [42]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [43].",

Significant differences are observed in some kinematic variables such as jet multiplicity, affecting the selection efficiency and the predicted final signal yield. Since the shapes of the final m T distributions are found to be compatible between the LO and the NLO samples, a LO-to-NLO correction is performed by scaling the final signal event yield from each intermediate-mass sample. The overall effect of the correction is to scale down the signal event yield, resulting in more conservative results than would be obtained using LO samples without this correction.",

The output of the PF algorithm is a set of PF candidates, classified into muons, electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons. The collision vertices are reconstructed from particle tracks using the deterministic annealing algorithm [65]. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of the physicsobject transverse momentum squared (p 2 T ) sum is taken to be the primary p p interaction vertex. The physics objects in this case are the jets, clustered using the anti-k T jet finding algorithm [66,67] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, calculated as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. All other reconstructed vertices are attributed to pileup.",

Pileup can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy deposits to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale between data and simulation [71].

The jets in these two background components have different quark and gluon composition implying different tau fake factors. Thus the fake factors for misidentified \u03c4 h from the QCD multijet events and for misidentified \u03c4 h from electroweak/top events are estimated separately. The fake factor for the QCD multijet events is defined as the ratio of the QCD multijet event yields in signal and control regions. The QCD multijet event yield in the control region is estimated by subtracting the simulated electroweak/top contribution (both genuine and non-genuine \u03c4 h events) from data. To estimate the contribution of the QCD multijet events in the signal region, a binned maximum likelihood fit of p miss T templates to data is performed, using the fraction of the QCD multijet events as a fit parameter. The templates describe the expected shape of the p miss T distribution for each background component prior to the fit. The p miss T shape of the QCD multijet events is assumed to be similar in the signal and control regions, so the shape observed in the control region is used as the fit template. The template for electroweak/top events is obtained directly from simulation. The fake factor for electroweak/top events is also estimated from simulation as the ratio of event yields in signal and control regions. Finally, the overall normalization factor of the control sample (as a function of the p T and |\u03b7| of the \u03c4 h ) is determined as a weighted sum of the two fake factors, where the weight corresponds to the relative fractions of the QCD multijet and electroweak/top events in the control region after all selections.
