Compared to its brother-functions, g 2 (and its related asymmetry A 2 ) has undergone relatively little experimental scrutiny. There have been some prior experimental extractions of g 2 at SLAC and CERN [1,2,3].

            "text": "Knowledge of nucleon structure can be expanded by considering generalised parton distributions (GPDs); access to GPDs can be achieved by measuring particle production in scattering processes where the target nucleon remains intact. The simplest process to measure is deeply virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS), where a photon is produced by a parton from the nucleon [6,7,8,9,10]. It is also possible to interpret measurements of produced mesons in the GPD framework, e.g. [11,12,13,14]. The HERMES experiment recently produced DVCS measurements from the entire 1995-2007 data set, where beam helicity and charge azimuthal asymmetries in the produced particle distributions are measured, see figures 2 and 3 respectively. The HERMES experiment can distinguish the pure DVCS contribution to the asymmetries from the contribution due to the interference with the competing Bethe-Heitler process due to the presence of both beam charges in the data set. These measurements are taken with a missing-mass selection technique, where the target nucleon scatters outside the HERMES geometric acceptance and must be reconstructed from measurements of the produced photon and scattered lepton. This event selection technique allows a certain amount of background into the data sample, mostly from events involving a resonant state of the target nucleon. The collaboration has also published measurements from an kinematically completely recostructed data sample [15] that was taken with additional experimental equipment-the beam helicity asymmetry measured using an exclusive event selection technique is shown in figure 4. Unfortunately, there is only a single beam charge available for this additional dataset, so it is not possible to distinguish between the contributions from the interference and |DVCS| 2 terms to the asymmetry. It is, however, possible to make a first extraction of the beam helicity asymmetry associated with the resonant events that contaminate the missing-mass selected data sample. The beam helicity asymmetry for the process ep \u2192 e\u0394\u03b3 \u2192 ep\u03c0 0 \u03b3 is shown in figure 5. The interference contribution to the first harmonic of the beam helicity asymmetry projected in six bins along the three kinematic dimensions \u2212t, x B and Q 2 . This measurement can be used to constrain a part of the GPD H, the generalised parton distribution that reduces to the parton distribution q(x) in its forward limit. Error bars are the statistical uncertainties; error bands are the systematic uncertainties.The curves on the figure come from [16] and [17]. FIGURE 3. The DVCS and interference contributions to the first harmonic of the beam charge asymmetry. This measurement can be used to constrain a part of the GPD H, the generalised parton distribution that reduces to the parton distribution q(x) in its forward limit. The curves on the figure come from [16] and [17]. FIGURE 4. The beam helicity asymmetry measured using a missing-mass event selection technique in the original HERMES acceptance (black), in the HERMES acceptance as modified by the installation of the recoil detector (blue) and with a highly pure exclusive event selection technique (red). The first harmonic shows that a pure sample has a slightly larger asymmetry value at the larger \u2212t values associated with high contamination in the missing-mass selected sample by resonsant events. The second harmonic is compatible with zero. FIGURE 5. The beam helicity asymmetry associated with the process ep \u2192 e\u0394\u03b3 \u2192 ep\u03c0 0 \u03b3, which is partly responsible for a 12% contamination of the missing-mass selected data sample. The amplitude of the asymmetry is compatible with zero.",
