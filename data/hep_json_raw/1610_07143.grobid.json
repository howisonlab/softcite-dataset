            "text": "In the past few decades, numerous searches have been made for the neutrinoless double-beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) process, aiming to establish whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles (Majorana neutrinos), but no 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal has yet been observed. A number of new experiments are proposed but they ultimately suffer from a common problem: the sensitivity may not increase indefinitely with the target mass. We have performed a detailed analysis of the physics potential by using the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to improve the sensitivity to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 up to a few meV, a major step forward with respect to the experiments currently being planned. JUNO is a 20 kton low-background liquid scintillator (LS) detector with 3%/ E(MeV) energy resolution, now under construction. It is feasible to build a balloon filled with enriched xenon gas (with 136 Xe up to 80%) dissolved in LS, inserted into the central region of the JUNO LS. The energy resolution is \u223c1.9% at the Q-value of 136 Xe 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. Ultra-low background is the key for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay searches. Detailed studies of background rates from intrinsic 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and 8 B solar neutrinos, natural radioactivity, and cosmogenic radionuclides (including light isotopes and 137 Xe) were performed and several muon veto schemes were developed. We find that JUNO has the potential to reach a sensitivity (at 90% C. L.) to T 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 1/2 of 1.8\u00d710 28 yr (5.6\u00d710 27 yr) with \u223c50 tons (5 tons) of fiducial 136 Xe and 5 years exposure, while in the 50-ton case the corresponding sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, m \u03b2\u03b2 , could reach (5-12) meV, covering completely the allowed region of inverted neutrino mass ordering.",

            "text": "Under the standard three neutrino framework, the effective neutrino mass in 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is defined as m \u03b2\u03b2 \u2261 | i (m i U 2 ei )|, where U ei (for i = 1, 2, 3) denote the matrix elements in the first row of lepton flavor mixing matrix U , and m i (for i = 1, 2, 3) are neutrino masses. For Majorana neutrinos, m \u03b2\u03b2 is sensitive to the neutrino masses, neutrino mixing angles and Majorana CP phases. Using the standard parametrization of U , m \u03b2\u03b2 = |m 1 c 2 12 c 2 13 e 2i\u03c6 1 + m 2 s 2 12 c 2 13 e 2i\u03c6 2 + m 3 s 2 13 | [1], where c 12 = cos\u03b8 12 , c 13 = cos \u03b8 13 , s 13 = sin \u03b8 13 , s 12 = sin \u03b8 12 , {\u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 } are neutrino mixing angles, and {\u03c6 1 , \u03c6 2 } are Majorana CP phases. In this definition of m \u03b2\u03b2 , it has been assumed that the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 process is dominated only by the exchange of light Majorana neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos or other exotic physics are not considered. If neutrinos have an inverted mass ordering, m \u03b2\u03b2 will be greater than \u223c0.015 eV, based on current and projected knowledge of the neutrino mixing parameters [2]. For the normal neutrino mass ordering case, no lower bound exists and m \u03b2\u03b2 could vanish due to the cancellation among the m i U 2 ei terms that are modulated by the Majorana phases. Enormous experimental efforts have been made to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 in the last few decades, using various nuclear isotopes, such as 136 Xe, 76 Ge, 130 Te, etc, as discussed in recent reviews (see [3] and references therein). None of them observed a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal. It is desirable for the next generation 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments to have a sensitivity of m \u03b2\u03b2 \u223c10 meV. With such sensitivity, if the neutrino mass ordering is determined to be inverted by future reactor and accelerator experiments, either a positive (observation of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay) or a negative (no observation) result would be able to probe the Majorana nature or Dirac nature of neutrinos, respectively.",

            "text": "Two-neutrino double-beta decay (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) is allowed by the Standard Model and has been observed in many nuclei. 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 can be distinguished from 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 by measuring the sum energy of the two electrons and looking for a mono-energetic peak at the Q-value. The region around the Q-value is referred to as the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 window, namely the region of interest (ROI). Different experiments might choose different ROIs, e.g, \u00b11\u03c3, \u00b12\u03c3, \u00b1 1 2 FWHM or even an asymmetric window around the Q-value, due to different background levels and energy resolutions. Excellent energy resolution and ultra-low background in the ROI are the keys to searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2. The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose experiment that primarily aims to determine the neutrino mass ordering and to measure precisely the neutrino mixing parameters [2,5]. Such precision measurement could reduce the range of T 0\u03bd 1/2 predictions by a factor of 2 [6]. The way to distinguish the neutrino mass ordering at JUNO is via exploring the effect of interference between atmospheric-and solar-\u2206m 2 driven oscillations [7][8][9]. The baseline design of the JUNO detector is a 20 kton low-background liquid scintillator (LS) with an unprecedented energy resolution (\u03c3/E) of 3%/ E(MeV). At the Q-value of 136 Xe 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay (Q 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 =2457.8 keV), or 130 Te (Q 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 =2530 keV), the energy resolution is expected to be \u223c1.9%, which is suitable for a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search. In addition, online purification is another advantage of LS detectors, and the liquid can reach the adequate level for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 searches. KamLAND-Zen [10] and SNO+ [11] are two examples, using 136 Xe and 130 Te isotopes, respectively. However, their detector sizes are limited so that their sensitivity to m \u03b2\u03b2 can only reach a few tens of meV. A very large LS detector can perform a better measurement [12].",

The stability, transparency and light yield would also decrease with high tellurium loading. Unlike xenon, cosmogenic activation of the tellurium nuclei could produce a large number of long-lived radioactive isotopes. To suppress such background, the exposure time of tellurium on the surface should be controlled. A purification process and additional long cooling time underground is necessary [16]. At the depth of JUNO, the cosmogenic background could be serious for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 searches. In this study, we choose 136 Xe as an example to evaluate the physics potential of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search at JUNO. The possibility of using 130 Te will be evaluated in future.",

From the simulated energy spectra of events from the 238 U chain, the background index was calculated to be 8.3/ROI/(ton 136 Xe)/yr. The 214 Bi-214 Po \u03b2-\u03b1 cascade decay (\u03c4 = 237 \u00b5s) is very effective at rejecting 214 Bi events. The \u03b1 energy from 214 Po decay is 7.686 MeV, and its quenched response is well above the detector threshold, resulting in a high efficiency of tagging 214 Bi events in the ROI. We evaluated the background rejection with Monte Carlo samples by requiring the time and distance between the prompt \u03b2 and delayed \u03b1 decay events to be less than 2.0 ms and 2.0 m, respectively. The residual background is due to the Bi-Po cascade decays that have a decay time longer than 2.0 ms, or occurred within one readout window (nominally 1 \u00b5s for JUNO) and their summed energy falls into the ROI.

Our GEANT4 MC indicated that the summation of the visible energies of 212 Bi \u03b2 + \u03b3 (Q = 2.252 MeV) and 212 Po \u03b1 (Q = 8.954 MeV) had a fraction of 6.2% inside the ROI window, while neither the individual \u03b2 nor \u03b1 decays could contribute to the ROI.

Thus, special care should be taken to distinguish and reject these two decays. JUNO will adopt 1 GHz Flash ADC (FADC) to record the full waveforms from all the PMTs inside the readout window, allowing a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) approach to distinguish two decays which are close in time. The LAB-based liquid scintillator was demonstrated to have good capability of e \u2212 /\u03b1 discrimination [22]. A full MC simulation including scintillation processes and PMT timing resolution was performed for the decays. We developed a PSD method by using the width and the tail fraction of the measured scintillation time profile, in which the time-of-light of photons were corrected. The discrimination efficiency was found to reach >97.5%, resulting in a residual ROI background of 0.03/ROI/(ton 136 Xe)/yr. Our GEANT4 MC indicated negligible contribution from internal 208 Tl decays (Q = 4.999 MeV) to the ROI, because the visible energy inside the LS is the summation of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 energies, which has a minimum energy of 3.2 MeV.

The latter two isotopes are \u03b2-n emitters with branching ratios of 51% and 16%, respectively. Such \u03b2-n decays can be rejected by coincidence cuts and were removed in this table. The production of the radioactive isotopes in JUNO LS was evaluated by GEANT4 [24] simulation. A Monte Carlo (MC) muon data set of \u223c342 days' worth of statistics was produced to study the cosmogenic backgrounds in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search. The results are summarized in Table 2, including the raw production rates, the primary production processes, the fractions for different number of accompanied neutrons and the background indexes in the ROI. The production rates from the earlier analysis [2] using FLUKA [25] were also listed for comparison. Both GEANT4 and FLUKA indicate that 10 C, 6 He, 8 Li and 12 B are the dominant contributors. Other isotopes were found to have relatively small contributions in the ROI, thus they were combined in the last row of the table. Given their long half-lives and relatively high muon rate in the JUNO detector, it was challenging to reject those backgrounds. In Table 2, our GEANT4 MC predicted a similar 10 C production yield to FLUKA, whereas it gave a lower 6 He, 8 Li and 12 B production yield than FLUKA. This is probably due to different hadronic interaction models being used. In the following analysis we used the newly produced GEANT4 MC data with large statistics, showing that the residual cosmogenic backgrounds after muon veto is evaluated to be \u223c10% of the total background. Thus the differences between FLUKA and GEANT4 were considered not to affect the main conclusion of this paper. To mimic a real data set, we assigned a time stamp for each primary muon and its daughters according to the average R \u00b5 =3 Hz muon rate, then the primary muons and their subsequent events were mixed and sorted.",
